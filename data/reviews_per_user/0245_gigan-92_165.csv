Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The Incredible Climax!!
","The story continues!! Having already defeated two of her five targets, Uma Thurman now focuses on Bill, a man whom we have yet a great deal to know. This film dives ever deeper into The Bride's past, including her estranged relationship with Bill and the shocking revelations that were hinted at the end of Volume I. This film is much less centered on the action itself but instead the relationships between these characters. I believe this works rather well considering the first piece was a gruesome thrill ride, and this one slows it down just a bit. Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah are among her final opponents, and both could get a lot more development in this film. Tarantino still pays tribute to Japanese and Hong Kong action films, but this too is tone down. And for all the build up there are still some well-served fight sequences.Near the climax there is a showdown of a different kind between Bill and the Bride. By now we know her real name, but I'd rather not reveal it to those who have yet to see it. It's not just a battle of martial arts and swords, or even a literal battle of vengeance. Whoever takes victory this time will also decide the fate of the child, The Bride's daughter. Such an emotional fascade surely will entertain watchers even more so than any action scene. I know it did for me.",9,2,4,24 March 2010
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Remember When They Said the First Film Couldn't Be Surpassed?
","A+ The first film truly was a surprise treat, I myself much expecting much less of it. Of course, I was blown away. Then came the news of the sequel, and then came the anxious trepidation. Would it flop? Could the previous story really be matched? Under the helm of Guy Ritchie once again, the film soars and abounds. Everyone is back, including a few new faces. Stephen Fry is a nice edition as the brother of Sherlock Holmes, and Jared Harris makes for a one intriguing villain. And let me not forget Paul Anderson, also well done.My only real complaint is (SPOILER) the afterthought Rachel McAdams becomes after she's been murdered, but Noomi Rapace is up to the task of playing yet another great character. She isn't the femme fatale-inspired character that McAdams was, but all the same very enticing and great to watch on screen. The plot moves at a steady pace and builds tension quite admirably. The comedy is well orchestrated but does not over shadow the plot twists which will demand your attention. And the climatic showdown between Holmes and guy's character, well it's one of my favorite film moments in a long time.Strikingly original, exciting locations and Hans Zimmer composing, the question is not if it can match up to the first film. No, the debate becomes which one of the two is superior to the other, and I myself have not been able to reach a verdict yet.",9,1,4,23 January 2012
The Incredible Hulk," Only One Word Describes It...Incredible!
","Well, after nearly five years, most thought there was to be no sequel to the 2003 'Hulk'. But, shortly after the spectacular 'Iron Man', 'The Incredible Hulk' arrived. I was surprised to find out Louis Leterrier was behind this thrilling film, but I guess he was truly the right man for the job. Where do I begin? Well, to start I'll say the story by Zak Penn was dope. The pacing is better I must admit and most viewers will find it much easier to embrace and connect with the characters. Edward Norton is perfect as the 'mild-mannered' Bruce Banner. Although some say he didn't portray the conflicted-side of Bruce enough, I think so. Liv Tyler and William Hurt also star, making this cast spectacular to say the least. The Hulk himself looks much more fearsome and the muscles are much more defined. In short he looks much more 'beasty'. But it comes at a cost of diminished realism really. The first Hulk actually looked like a human stillquite a bit, so maybe in the end he was a litte overdone.Speaking of beasty, Tim Roth is excellent as Emil Blonsky/Abomination. One major problem with the first film was its villain, and this film definitely doesn't disappoint there. Abomination's rampage scene alone is exhilarating, and the end fight delivers. It's brutal, bloody and last forever, YES!!! The score by Craig Armstrong is magnificent, letting the film play as a scary monster movie of sorts and I utterly love it!! Only one word can describe this film....Incredible!",8,5,9,11 May 2009
Antz," 'Strange is not the word I useÂ…'
","This is one of those movies that fly over your head when you're a child watching it. I remember Disney's Pixar and DreamWorks used to really clash in the past over the originality of premises. 'A Bug's Life' vs. 'Antz', this is one of the ones I feel only a tie is fair. 'Antz' is an amazing animated film for one reason above all: awesome voice cast. Gene Hackman, Christopher Walken, Danny Glover and Woody Allen, there's almost too much talent to bear. Also, there's so much subtle humor to appreciate. I originally saw the film ten years ago and laughed and now being an adult there's so much I missed. Only now do I get the adult-oriented jokes, truly making the movie timeless. And the film has a pretty good theme to it; the importance of individuality as opposed to the hordes of conformity.'Antz' is great.",10,2,4,10 July 2012
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Perhaps the Worst Installment
","Fans waited 16 years for this? For shame, George Lucas, for shame. I had embraced the original trilogy as a child and was expecting this film to create that same sense of amazement as the first films did. This movie had its high points, but Jar Jar Binks is often unbearable. Rather, it is Anakin Skywalker I found annoying. He didn't care for him as much as I thought I should for being THE Anakin Skywalker. The Gungans and Jar Jar come off as okay characters, but Jar Jar himself becomes tiring.The whole film seems ruined with this aura of cheeriness and way too much comic relief in my opinion. The plot was well done actually and we have some good actors here, including Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor, and Liam Neeson . Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson were both pretty awesome ein the movie, but it was Natalie Portman who was rather stale most of the time. Perhaps the main problem with this one was the lack of any emotional strong points, as seen in the five other films. Things just kind of happen, you know? Lucas probably relied too much on a mystery-type setting to make up the film's lack of any and few emotions, probably as a way to set up the two sequels. As it stands, a bad choice but the film has its redeeming moments. The highlight of this film is definitely the three-way lightsaber duel. Incredibly intense, with John William's score playing along with it, one reason to see the film in itself. Not to mention there's quite a bit to see in this film, which is also a plus, and in the end I still like to watch my DVD of Episode I from time to time.",7,3,6,26 June 2009
Sucker Punch," Vivid, Sexy, Genuine, New Generation Fantasy
","I had high expectations for this film ever since I saw the first trailer. The film's target audience seemed pretty predictable, but with Zack Snyder I knew he'd deliver more. I'm in love with '300' and 'Watchmen' so I you already know he plans on succeeding on many levels, and as usual he doesn't disappoint. The beauty of it all is that this is an original story, and so I'm looking forward to his future projects.Let me start by saying the story itself will start off kind of cryptic, but if you analyze it properly you'll keep up. The acting was so spot on with these characters, their beauty was only a plus. I had been worrying about Vanessa Hudgens' capabilities, but she did rather well I must admit. Jena Malone was my personal favorite, and she portrayed her character perfectly. Emily Bowning was spectacular and Oscar Isaac came off pretty damn menacing. Carla Gugino was also pretty good as well, and Scott Glenn was a very enjoyable character. You quickly embrace them all, despite the fact you know little about them all. I don't want to spoil much but I will quickly go over what makes this film so enjoyable. The soundtrack and score were amazing to listen to, giving the film a very surreal feel to it. Of course covers can never surpass the original piece of music, but still Yoav and Emily Browning is great. It keeps the film energetic yet appropriately ominous and dark when necessary. The cinematography and action scenes are incredibly elaborate and the CGI is well used. Every scene is just insane and a real treat to watch.Let alone being a superbly visual film overall, it works on a psychological stand point as well. Its themes are powerful, best summed up that reality can be harsh and cruel, nut it is better to die free than live in damn nation. I believe 'Sucker Punch' is going to be a hard hitter for 2011, despite the many ignorant reviews dismissing it. Don't listen to the critics this time.",8,24,48,31 March 2011
The Hangover," Incredibly Funny
","this film delivers solely on its premise, and basically just that. However, it does this incredibly well with a flowing plot that delivered constant laughs. The cast consist of Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, although Zack Galifianakis definitely was the funniest person in the whole picture. Justin Bartha didn't end up doing much, but I enjoyed his moments in the flick as well. As anyone knows the plot is as simple as they come, leaving no real character development, aside Ed Helms' character. And so with that said, this film definitely delivers in the aspect of sheer, outrageous comedy, in a way that was nicely natural and unforced, but I could not rate it as high as 'Super Bad' or 'Pineapple Express'.Mike Epps and Ken Jeong were actually more memorable than the actual cast of protagonists, but it all blends together as probably the funniest film in a while. And oh yeah, Jeffrey Tambor was in it. Wish he'd had a larger role because as I've seen in the 'Hellboy' films he can be pretty funny at times.",8,1,2,14 December 2010
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Greatest Adventure Flick Ever!!
","'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is truly one of the greatest adventure flicks ever, if not of all time. George Lucas takes a shot at writing a story that doesn't involve spaceships and the 'Force' and what we get is a very good story. Well written characters and an interesting story that doesn't over do it, yes!! It keeps our interest and offers a unique setting that the fits the film well. Every actor has a role they were born to play and for Harrison Ford this is defiantly it. The pacing is excellent and the comedic elements are well portioned. The score by John Williams is unforgettable and like any score by the composer the theme for Indy is unmistakable to this day. This film is no less than a classic and one of Spielberg's best works no doubt. The sequels were no less incredible. Sigh, till 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' came along...damn!!",10,2,4,16 May 2009
Casablanca," 'It seems destiny has taken a hand.'
","This film is a monumental piece of film history. I can honestly it might just be one of the best movies of all time. If anything, you have to acknowledge the writing. Almost every single line of dialogue in the film is a household terminology to this day, most people paying tribute to the film without even knowing it. That's why I wanted to use a less popular quote for the title, and it has its own meanings within the film. Another joy of the film is composer Max Steiner; yes, Max Steiner of 1933's 'King Kong'. His music is timeless, and he captures the mystery and romance of the film perfectly.It's definitely a love story at a glance, one of the best ever told if not so, but I view it more as a story of sacrifice, on the part of both lovers. The film is also a piece of history, taking place during the Second World War It entails a time when the Third Reich's immense shadow was cast over all of Europe, and the film portrays this quite nicely. However the film is about more than Charlie Chaplin poking fun at the Nazi Party (gotta love Chaplin). There is quite a bit of nicely done comedy within the weaving of it all, but it's balanced just right.I'm not sure if it qualifies as a film noir exactly, but Rick (Humphrey Bogart) is cynical enough to fit the bill and the use of shadows is quite extraordinary. The setting and lighting during the best scenes of the movie are darkened rooms, making it all the more intense. As I said before, Rick, with his sarcasm and pessimism, is one of my favorite characters of all time. To me the movie is about him most of all. He sees the events taking place before him, knows he must act, but for a while chooses not to. The beauty of it all is that we know why and we feel for him.All the performances are incredible. Like all golden era Hollywood flicks of the 50s, it draws our attention without the use of bloodshed and sexuality. Although don't be mistaken, it is indeed used here and very subtly I add. Its takes a film lover's eyes and ears to catch it, and the story telling is just marvelous.One cannot be a true fan of cinema without having seen 'Casablanca'.",10,4,5,1 February 2012
Training Day," 'Breathe dog, breathe.'
","A+ This is movie is a hard hitter and definitely not to be missed. It's an urban crime-thriller taking place where else but in the run down ghettos of Los Angeles. Ethan Hawke is quite good as the naÃ¯ve protagonist and the cast is also filled with many other well done roles. Peter Greene is always entertaining, and Eva Mendes is always a treat, clothes on or off. The highlight of the movie is Denzel Washington. His performance is a combination of spectacular acting and writing. Half the time you're not sure if he's just an abuser of power or a true demon, and every second of his screen time is just marvelous. Also starring in small roles are many rap legends from the genre's 90s hey-day, namely Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre.The action is pretty intense and the camera follows it gracefully. My favorite scene had to be when Denzel visits his friend Roger, played by Scott Glenn . Delightfully brutal, and also a very plot-driven film I urge all to see.",10,2,3,1 February 2012
Star Trek," A Sci-Fi Classic By All Means
","I should start this by saying that I always leaned more toward Star Wars than Star Trek. I've memorized much of the Star Wars epic sci-fi fantasy and numerous characters, but the universe of Star Trek is one I have not really explored. The beauty of this film is that you can be a hard core Trek-fan or a simple lover of sci-fi or action and still find this an incredibly enjoyable movie. I myself was surprised when I first saw it, seeing all the relatable humor it was pouring out, but unlike the redundant idiocy of let's say Michael Bay, the jokes are welcome and don't go too far.The cast is pretty well put together, and each character is pretty memorable and involved quite well. Eric Bana was excellent as Nero, not to mention Bruce Greenwood is awesome as well. Zachary Quinto is the beloved Spock and for one of those hyper-intelligent characters it's a character you will end up feeling emotionally drawn to. The story never drags at all and it's all together a pretty well written piece of sci-fi I must add. To be honest Chris pine is great in the movie, it's just that at times he too much of an archetype 'bad-ass', dare I say it? How many times have I seen a drunken protagonist in a bar starting a fight with a guy and/or trying to get a girl who views him as trash. Other than that, though, he does fine, and the rest of the cast is no less than good.The cinematography was beautiful on its own, let alone the action scenes. Speaking of which, a new bar for space battles has been set. And the score by Michael Giacchino and Alexander Courage was not too shabby. In fact I thoroughly embraced it. I consider it a must see, being one of those rare sci-fi gems anyone can enjoy.",9,65,129,23 May 2011
Fight Club," 'I'd fight Ghandi'
","A+ A very unusual movie coming from David Fincher, who recovered quickly from the massive failure that was 'Alien 3'. One would hardly assume that the two films had the same director. This film is based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, which I haven't read. However, there are some very relevant themes here, namely freedom from the rampant materialism that has consumed this country. Secondly, it begs the question to the audience if their life has any meaning to it all. It's showcased in one scene where our characters practically kill themselves, and Brad Pitt says, 'We've just had a near life experience.' This leads me to the cast which was pretty good. Brad Pitt was the anarchist Tyler and the character is awesome. Edward Norton is our unnamed narrator as well as supposed protagonist, and he also does nicely. Helena Bonham Carter didn't play all that pivotal a character if you ask me, but regardless she plays the role quite well. The whole movie is filled with this beautiful dark humor and truly stomach-churning violence. Blend those with the intriguing storyline and you have a film that in itself is hard to even categorize. There are also some bizarre, big-budget, shots in the movie, odd for film that technically wasn't in need of too big a budget. They don't distract though, and the photography by Jeff Cronenworth is awesome. The 'Dust Brothers' (Michael Simpson and John King) provide a unique and certainly unusual score, but rightfully so for an unusual film.I highly recommend 'Fight Club' for a unique and hard-hitting film experience.",10,1,3,19 September 2011
Inglourious Basterds," Enjoyable Tarantino Production
","B- A lot of reviews have stated to hate this movie, a lot calling it Tarantino's worst film ever made. However, there are still more than enough positive reviews coming in to put this film surprisingly high on the top 250 list of ALL TIME LIST. Does it deserve such recognition? No, not really. This doesn't even come close to the greatness of some of his classic movies; I personally found 'Jackie Brown', often considered the weakest installment in Tarantino's line of films, to be much better handled. Why so? Let me say that for starters this story had no real point. I thought it started off okay, I myself particularity enjoying the Bastards and their Nazi-killing sessions. However, it delved into the dream like fantasy of a ten year old boy who'd fantasized far too much about WWII films by the climax. Hitler, all the top Nazi brass, in one room? It just seemed too over-the-top, to the point of ridiculousness. The story has its saving graces though, such as the exhilarating opening scene. It is here we meet Christopher Waltz's character, who is one of Tarantino's most sadistic yet cunning antagonists yet. I enjoyed him throughout the movie. And Dennis Menochet as the farmer was one of the best, if not short-lived, performances in the whole film. Brad Pitt was pretty damn enjoyable as Lt. Aldo Raine. Who didn't enjoy watching him carve swastikas into Nazis' foreheads? Also pretty enjoyable was Melanie Laurnet as Shosanna, and I loved Michael Fassbender in the film.Two characters I was disappointed with were Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger) and Sgt. Donny Donowitz, a.k.a. the 'Bear Jew' (Eli Roth). They were the most underdeveloped characters in the movie, the only real notion you get from their on-screen presence being that they apparently hate Nazis. AS for the treatment of the Nazis in the film, people have been particular about the assumption that the Jews in the film appear without any humanity while the Nazis appear as honorable men. I wouldn't call the Jewish characters inhuman, just horrendously bland, and as for the Nazis I rather like that scene with the bat. It's rather obvious that'd you'd almost feel pity for the Nazi officer as he's honorably clubbed to death, and simply typecasting them as mindless maniacs would be, how to say, clichÃ©? One other thing that irked me was the climax of the relationship between Shosanna and Fredrick Zoller. After all her hatred of the Nazis which was perfectly justified, it seems highly unlikely that'd she suddenly feel pity for one of them.However, Tarnantino still manages to deliver some very thrilling and tension filled scenes that will have you on the edge of your seat. So over all I enjoyed this film, but this is definitely not the best story he's written and therefore not his best film yet as many have called it.",8,1,6,3 January 2011
Underworld," An Awesome Thrill Ride of a Movie
","This was an awesome film to watch. Firstly, the Gothic style of the architecture and dark lighting gives the film a magnificent look throughout. The shots are epic and the look of the werewolves is terrifying. Some criticize the 'over-acting' but in general it's still pretty good. As a fan of classic horror and monster films, it was great to see the amount of mythology that went into the screenplay. Kate Beckinsale was pretty awesome in her role and was a great anti-hero. There are great characters here, which are why I enjoy it so much, like Lucian played by Michael Sheen. My favorite of them all is Viktor. He had an incredible presence only Bill Nighy could give off. Some characters are left poorly developed, especially Raze (Kevin Grevioux). He could've used more screen time and the character of Michael Corvin was a decent character but he doesn't really stand out until he becomes the hybrid.But the pacing is fantastic and the score by Paul Haslinger really surprised me. The action hits hard and the setting just completes the film. The near climax portion of the plot might lose a few but it's just a fun movie to watch.",8,3,5,4 July 2011
Dawn of the Dead," One of the Few Well-Made Horror Re-Makes
","Zack Synder is one of the finest contemporary directors of our time. Here he's taken a 1978 masterpiece and has managed to create a version that pays tribute to the original but is also different enough not to feel unnecessary (kinda vice versa how 'Predators' felt unnecessary even though it WASN'T a re-make, it sure felt like one with the countless homages). I felt the Tom Savini directed re-make of 'Night of the Living Dead' was a great movie, while the Nick Cannon-starring re-make of 'Day of the Dead' was just plain sh*tty. This film stands on its own remarkably well.It has awesome cameos of Tom Savini, Ken Foree and yes Scott Reiniger fans of the original will enjoy. I'm surprised they didn't sneak in George Romero in there somewhere (maybe he's one of the zombies if you look hard enough...). Any who, the characters do have less screen time individually due to a larger cast, but they're still pretty memorable. Most noteworthy of them all is Ving Rhames obviously. He's the new zombie-killing bad ass. Sarah Polley, Jake Weber, Mekhi Phifer and Michael Kelly all do really well. The director's cut is definitely the way to go, you get to further immerse yourself into the world set up by the camera. As for for the zombies, I whole heartedly prefer the original designs. The slow movement allows you to analyze the disgusting details as it were. The zombies in this film are agile and fast movers, probably somewhat inspired from the 'zombies' of '28 Days Later'. It works because the film is aiming more for action than grueling horror which is easy to tell thru a lot of its comedic moments. And yes, credit to Tyler Bates for creating a very effective score.While not up to par with the original, this one is definitely worth a look due to a different, fast-paced direction. The director's cut is the preferred edition to see it.",9,1,2,20 March 2012
Iron Man 2," A Faithful Sequel
","I thankfully saw this film on opening day, but had to see it two more times before writing this review. Thank the lord, Jon Favreau returns in his rightful place as director. I couldn't imagine what horrors would've taken place otherwise. Then again it is only the first sequel....the trilogy factor still haunts me.The majority of the cast returns, including Gwyneth Paltrow. For a while I feared she'd be replaced, with all the rumors. Robert Downey Jr. is back, and keeps the character consistent with those classic comedic attributes. Well done, but unfortunately Terrance Howard does not return. A downer, but Don Cheadle is up to the task and he does nicely. Also starring is the beautiful Scarlett Johansson, in a role that was all right. After seeing it a few more times, it occurs to me she's almost eye candy, and could've used a lot more developing. As for 'Happy', there wasn't much to him and a rather needless character really. Hammer, however, was very well done and the film couldn't be what is without him. Mickey Rourke is the main antagonist and his performance is all right. Comparing him to Jeff Bridges' villain in the first film would be slander, seeing as he's nowhere near as interesting. The general tone of the film was light-hearted so to speak, really down playing the dark notions of the film concerning Tony's slowly approaching death. It still flows but it's more of a comedy film which is a eh direction for me.The action looks great but these scenes are few-and-far between if you ask me. The Iron Man suit is looking better than ever, my personal favorite being the Mark V. The race track scene was exhilarating although I have yet to understand how Whiplash, an ordinary man, could endure physical blows from that high powered suit. In the first film, a single punch sends a man flying. Well, pushing that aside, the end battle is epic and I really love the drones in action. But no doubt the absolute best-looking in the film is War Machine. An awe-inspiring and over all imposing character, loved his ass. One thing that bugged me was John Debney. His score was all in all decent, but I really preferred the style heard in the first film. Not a major distraction, but one found worthy of noting. In conclusion definitely see it, and I'm sure you'll leave the theater knowing your money was well spent.'It's called looking like a bad-ass.'",6,3,6,12 June 2010
Elizabeth," It captures many emotions
","Elizabeth is a 1998 'historical' drama portraying the rise of one of history's most notable women, Queen Elizabeth of England. The film first portrays her as a princess who lives out on the countryside before delving into the first few years as the new queen after the death of Mary. It focuses primarily on the perils she faced, both at home and abroad. Directed by Shekhar Kapur and starring the likes of Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, and Joseph Fiennes, the movie was a huge success at the box office as well as with the critics. It was not only nominated, but also won, several Oscars. After watching it myself, I can see why it was as lauded as it was since it was a very well done film. However, how does it fair in historical accuracy? WellÃ‚â€¦yes and no. Elizabeth's portrayal as a foil to her half-sister's religious authoritarian-style rule is spot on, especially when recounting the film's gruesome opening. The large-scale opposition of opposition from the Pope is also fairly accurate. The film even mentions England's poor fiscal and military status at the beginning of her reign, nicely done. In spite of all this, the film takes several liberties, both large and small. The death of Mary of Guise at the hand of Walsingham is one such instance, but by far the biggest is the portrayal of Robert Dudley. The move opens with a seemingly accurate depiction of just how close he was to the Queen. The cracks begin to show when Elizabeth discovers Dudley is married, which is a shock to her. In reality she knew of the marriage before she was even Queen. The film takes it even further by having Dudley become involved in a plot to betray Elizabeth. This is quite literally the exact opposite of how their relationship actually was. It is a well-known historical fact that the two remained close friends until his death which devastated her. To go over all of them would be an essay in itself, but simply put the film clearly had no intention of sticking to what actually happened. It is almost insulting to call it a 'historical biography' since it is more of a historical fantasy. All that being said, the movie is still spectacular in all other regards. The acting and cinematography are breath taking, and the score by David Hirschfelder is just timeless. It captures many emotions, from terror to pure magnificence.",9,0,0,22 August 2017
Spider-Man 2," Truly Outdoes the First
","Wow. That's all I can manage to say after watching this film, wow. This movie really blew me away in all its aspects. The performances were top rate, especially Alfred Molina's portrayal of Dr. Otto Octavius. He really knows how to play that comic book villain with a sense of understanding so to speak. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst romance is a truly interesting and different outlook on being a super hero. We often dream of being super heroes, and yet here we see just the opposite. The audience feels Peter's conflict between protecting the innocent and letting his own life suffer or letting it go and living the life he's always wanted. To get everything he ever desired, he must give up his double-life. Despite whether he gives up being Spider-man or not, he will still forever have to deal with the complication of his dying friendship with Harry Osborn( James Franco). Franco is my favorite actor in this film, a young millionaire dealing with the death of his father, his friend being the only one who can help him bring the murder to justice. And yet, unbeknownst to him, his friend is actually the wall crawler himself. A extremely well done screenplay. Sam Raimi adds touches of humor to the story and it blends in quite well.The characters are just so well done and intertwined with one another. Sam Raimi makes more than just a comic blockbuster but a well-defined drama of sorts. Even the villain has his moments.The action is unbelievable and truly out does the first. Future superhero films will have to work hard to surpass what is seen here. The train chase is by far my favorite scene in the film, truly adrenaline pumping!! Audiences do have to wait a bit, but once a fight starts prepare to be simply amazed. Not only this, but the score is magnificent!! I love Danny Elfman!! It captures each moment exactly the way audiences envision it. Another sequel is surely on the way. This is definitely one of my favorite films of 2004, putting other comic book films of the same year to shame, such as 'Blade: Trinity'.",10,24,35,24 September 2009
127 Hours," You'll Never Look at Scooby-Doo the same way Again
","I've been a constant aficionado of Danny Boyle's work, and this film is one of best quite honestly. I came in expecting a simple tale of survival, but instead I found myself completely entranced by the story telling. Great visuals help to put you there in between the crevice walls and really make you experience the toll of the situation. Boyle even manages to achieve many moments of surrealism within it all. Imagine the terrifying and dark premise, and yet there are nicely done moments of comedy that fit in quite nicely. Of course, a large part of the film's effectiveness is the casting of James Franco. Words can't describe how awesome he was from start to finish. As an added bonus, it's one of those rare treats that for the most part lives up to its true-story basis. I highly recommend the film.",10,0,1,23 May 2012
Batman Returns," 'No, it's a lot!' :)
","A The heart thumping sequel to the original. My personal favorite of the original series of films. Tim Burton returns to direct a truly great sequel, once more giving us a darkly lit and truly different world. Some hash it for the realismÃ‚â€¦f*ck you!! It's Batman, the super hero genre in general. Anyways, Danny Elfman reprises his role as the tour de force composer , delivering a score that sounds similar to his work on 'Edward Scissorhands' and 'Nightmare Before Christmas'. I was thrilled to listen to it, bringing every moment in the film to its utmost sharpness.Michael Keaton returns (no pun intended) and once again plays the role perfectly. While Vicki Vale may be gone, Bruce gets to tangle with Michelle Pfeiffer. Her performance was insane, sexy and full of zest she constantly brung to the screen. Did Danny DeVito really measure up to Jack Nicholson? Hel yeah! This is truly how Bob Kane would have brought this character to life. DeVito captures the character quite well, both comically and with a sense of rage. Michael Gough is back as well, just another plus. Christopher Walken is our sleazy business man, extraordinarily well done. It's a visual style and a story line only Tim Burton could bring together so well. Keep in mind there are a lot of funny lines in this flick, but it never downplays the seriousness of it all. The mood of the film, along with a lot of the story is incredibly dark, malicious, and even somewhat disturbing. It's one of the aspects that really draw me to this film.A not so light hearted, well done sequel. The effects and fight scenes are as well done as the rest of the film and original. I had always wished Burton had done the other two sequels. I can only imagine how much greater they'd be, and the marks they could have left on film history.",9,7,17,27 October 2010
Finding Nemo," Almost the best
","What can be said of the movie that inspired legions of people to purchase clown fish? Put simply it is among Stanton's best, I'm just astonished by the quality of the film overall. The animation was just top notch, so intricate and filled with little details that it takes several viewings to notice it all. A well-crafted story and magnificent score also bring this film to near absolute perfection.And then as the icing on an already scrumptious cake, the voice acting was great, with Albert Brooks, Alexander Gould and Ellen (?), of all that I had expected. Unlike many formulaic and tiresome Disney movies, this one is fresh with its material and story, and is oh so enjoyable after many watches.",10,1,3,13 December 2010
Blade," A Decent Hero/ Vampire Flick
","Overall, I give this film a decent 7.6. To start I'll say I love how the character was portrayed and adapted on to the screen. If you read comics occasionally or simply watch DVD extras you'll see the Blade character is drastically different from the one we see in the film. Among the changes, Blade is now most importantly half vampire, therefore acquiring 'all of their strengths, but none of their weaknesses.' The credit for this goes obviously to David Goyer, a fellow fan of the darker genre of comic books. Thanks to him Blade has become a much more interesting character and I find him one of my favorite anti-heroes really. Wesley Snipes is born to play this role, although some would've probably preferred Dezenel Washington or Will Smith. His acting here doesn't need to be exactly Oscar winning per say considering the character but I'm glad he decides to play the DayWalker in the two sequels. Also starring is Stephen Dorff as our main villain and Kris Kristofferson as Blade's Alfred so to speak. The acting is good actually and the action keeps the plot going for sure. The opening scene in the club is one of my favorite parts I've got to say. I have to pick apart a sense of extra non-realism: a black man in a leather coat with a sword beating the #$%^ out of a cop in broad day light some how going unnoticed by the crowds walking by seemed kinda..well...dumb. Moving away from a few of its flaws, the music by Mark Isham was great and fitted the film nicely. Luckily stunning sequel, 'Blade 2' improves itself.",8,2,13,18 July 2009
Superbad," Raunchy yet Hearfelt
","One of the best comedies ever served in m y opinion. The all-too familiar Greg Mottola is the man at work here, and where credit is due I'll award points to the writer s Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. However, this film would drop dead on its face without its hilarious cast undoubtedly, Jonah Hill and Christopher Mintz-Plasse being the two most unforgettable stars. Michael Cera is the kind of, I suppose, innocent-type guy who is both driven by hormones yet conflicted by almost inhuman genuine-ness and politeness. Not too many laughs coming from his way but when he did, he did so superbly. Bill Hader and Set Rogen were just top notch. I would also like to amend Emma Stone as Jules, who delivered the greatest 'what the f*ck?!' in a good while.All these zany and truth be told rather realistic characters were interpreted pretty well and where as the film was insanely funny the character development was right on par with the laughs. That's probably the film's most monumental achievement, seeing as the soundtrack was one I was rather indifferent about (but not one I despised). 'Super Bad' is grade A comedy at its finest.",10,16,23,16 December 2010
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Is it a Spin-Off Or a Pathetic Prequel? Either Way, Total Garbage
","F+ Well, I'm afraid to announce once again Bryan Singer has let someone else ruin his masterpieces. First it was Brett Ratner with the disappointing 'X-Men III', now this mediocre film. Gavin Hood did not belong in the director's chair but Fox was so eager to release yet another sequel, I just guess they didn't feel like waiting on Mr. Singer. The story is okay, minus A LOT of the horrible lines. It almost makes you think this spin-off is a prequel, or is it? But once again we have a very rushed story ending with a film not even reaching 110 minutes! When will these directors realize that for a film with so many super-powered humans a little more time to develop the characters would be much appreciated? Who knows. The cast was okay. Hugh Jackman is back to play the role no one else could thankfully, but he must yell at least five or six times in this flick. Enough with the roaring Hugh Jackman with no shirt on! We already know he's buff. I love Ryan Reynolds, but as in 'Blade: Trinity', he just happens to be in the crummy sequel following an extraordinary one. Not that it matters, the suit of Deadpool is skewered, more on that tragedy later. Two characters I'm very disappointed with are Sabertooth and Stryker. Sabertooth is portrayed okay by Liev Schreiber, a pushing it okay albeit. But Danny Huston had no business playing Stryker. His performance was crappy compared to Brian Cox's portrayal of the character. Gambit could've used more screen time and Will.I.Am simply didn't belong in this film. Hood even tries to cameo Anna Paquin and Patrick Stewart, but I for one am not impressed. The action nothing special, especially considering in the comics Wolverine is a vile and very violent bastard, but in the movie he's more of a pacifist whose supposed love is killed. Deadpool, like Gambit, received little to no screen time. I mean Deadpool having his mouth sown shut? It defeats the whole purpose of the character. And the end battle is over rated by audiences. Plus the chase scene on involving a chopper and a motorcycle was horrendously over the top. To add to this film the score was terrible, being as everything else in this movie, average. Enough said I believe.",1,1,4,13 May 2009
The Mummy," Never Before Has Brendan Fraser Been So Enjoyable!!
","A re-make of the legendary 1932 horror classic, comes a film by Stephen Sommers and one of the best films of the 90s steps forth. Our director took the original story and expanded it into an even better incarnation of the story that people will be sure to love. It really adds a lot more dimension to the characters. Naturally, this film does not live up to the atmosphere of the classic and is far from surpassing it in anyway. This is a standard fun little adventure movie not to be taken seriously.Released at the turn of the century, I saw this film at a young age and realized what an achievement these effects were. They couldn't be better to say the least. ILM has never failed us have they?? Let alone this, we have a spectacular cast assembled here. Brendan Fraser has never before, or since, been so enjoyable. He was born to play this role I believe. Playing as his love interest is Rachel Weisz, beautiful and a damn good actress. As her brother Johnathan is John Hannah, who supplies his much appreciated comedic touches when needed. Being a well done blend of horror/adventure, it's so surprising the comedy works along with our mummy's terror scenes, which are imposing as one would envision. Playing Imhotep is Arnold Volsoo and the suspense in the film is played out rather well. Even with his sidekick Benny at his aide. Chilling scenes with awesome action sequences, Sommers has outdone himself here with this re-make. But let's not forget Jerry Goldsmith, who delivers a thrilling score. He really captures the tone of the film in his music, as he always does. It's a fun movie and nothing more. Love it, surely a classic.",9,3,4,23 March 2010
Terminator Salvation," Should Not Have Been Released, Really.
","What a disappointment, really. For this film I'm not even going to bother going into details. Whoever this McG is a HORRIBLE director. Where to start, where to start, hmmm.....oh, I know, the complicated plot. Damn, half the time I didn't know what the sh*t was going on and when I did I felt the need to say it was either highly predictable or just plain dumb. To this day I'm still not sure what happened at the terminator base of operations. The characters didn't thrill me at all and I found rather boring really. John Connor's role felt like a bit of an afterthought compared to that cyborg dude, whatever his name was. And oh yeah, WTF?! Christian Bale doing his Batman voice?! I'm starting to think it's a medical condition at this point, seriously. The story simply lacks substance and very little emotion was evoked from this film. The first two, even the third, give off an atmosphere that intrigued and amazed audiences, really giving off several themes actually. Like the endurance of the human soul. The only theme hear is crew's bad writing.",5,1,3,18 July 2009
The Day After Tomorrow," Dismal Roland
","In the usual predictable ploy of the infamous Roland Emmerich and Dean Delvin, the duo takes a promising concept; whether it be alien invasion, global warming, Godzilla (GINO), or more recently the laughable end of the world coming in 0'12. The poorly executed premises are always accompanied by the lame clichÃƒÂ© stories and predictable outcomes, which they also never fail to deliver. I will hand it to them the first half of this movie is somewhat entertaining, although only due to the disaster sequences which are attuned with a bit of touching music from time to time. You could almost say it 'felt real', but alas it still grows horrendously over the top at times. Like the scientists who just had to have those samples for instance....yuck, suddenly I have a bad taste in my mouth.But once all the water freezes, the film becomes hopelessly boring. Dennis Quad did all right and Jake Gyllenhaal did so as well with the script he was handed. Everyone else is mildly dove into, but not enough to hold my attention. The story basically struggles to find things for everyone to do. The end bit with a 'ice age temperature eye-of-the-storm' was a hit and miss climax that just wasn't that involving.All together your in for the same old eye candy visuals, but you might always take the disc out once the first half is over.",5,3,6,5 January 2011
X-Men," A Good Start
","The popular comic is finally brought to life. Bryan Singer brings us a very innovative film that is a fantastic way to start the series. The main challenge here was getting the right actors to portray these unique characters. We are not let down. Patrick Stewart is Professor X, Ian McKellen is Magneto, James Marsden is Cyclops, along with Halle Berry and Famke Janssen. The performances are top rate most definitely and Hugh Jackman is dope as Logan/Wolverine. I don't think anyone could play him the way Hugh does. The writing is very well done and grabs you from the beginning till the end, a rare feat these days. And while there are bits of comedy, it does so while maintaining the dignity of the characters presented.The action is well paced and incredibly well done. The shots are simply magnificent. The music is also very original and offers something new for the hero genre, a nice touch. Rest in peace Michael Kamen, and I'm glad to own the soundtrack. In short, this film is great, but some criticize its shortness is its major problem. Luckily, Fox has released the extended cut 'X-Men 1.5', solving this dilemma. As an intro piece to a much bigger universe, it does fine.",10,2,4,13 May 2009
Spider-Man 3," All Good Things Must Come To An End
","Why must all good things come to an end? After two very successful films, Sam Raimi obviously goes for a third, but the result is a little less than expected. Normally in this kind of situation, the trilogy situation, it is a new director that changes the film so much the third seems like a piece of trash compared to the first two. However, it is the same director for all three, so I guess Raimi just lost his touch. One thing I want to say right off the bat is the lack of Danny Elfman is unacceptable! I don't give a &*^% who Christopher Young is, he doesn't even come close to Elfman's greatness! What a poor choice, but is merely one among many. Another failed aspect of the film is its sorrowly failed attempt to become much darker. There is simply too many cheesy moments and humor for that to have worked unfortunately. Topher Grace and Thomas Hayden Church are excellent additions to the cast, but the story is too rushed to even enjoy it.I feel James Franco's A-list acting was put to bad use here. He finally becomes the second Green Goblin and I actually enjoy the suit (but not the flying snowboard though). However, he spends most of the film in a pathetic amnesia. We do see a bit of his father's dark qualities once he does regain his memory, but like everything else in this film it isn't drawn to its full potential.Sandman's creation is not even thirty minutes into the film and is so poorly executed it looks a modern version of a 50s sci-fi thriller. He just happens to a hop a fence and land in a zany 'molecular rotator' or whatever it was called. Very unbelievable, too much for most I assume. I did enjoy the action but the villains just aren't built up enough here. The first two films had a single villain, allowing a lot of time for the audiences to 'connect' with them so to speak. Sam Raimi tried to do overdo it honestly, but it could've worked. But instead of extending the run time, we get a movie that just isn't long enough to have all these new characters. It barely runs over two hours. One of my biggest issues with 'Spider-Man 3' is Venom. The characters is my personal favorite and no less among fans. His screen time was pathetic to say the least. The best villain had no time to go deep into his character. He doesn't even mention his name!! They could've done so much more, certainly at the climax. It felt like it was just all big effects and an attempt to sell merchandise to the kids.Well, I don't know if there should be a fourth or not, but Sam Raimi needs to get his ^&&* together!!",6,2,3,24 September 2009
The Terminator," Bold, Gritty, and Realistic
","The 1984 classic, an astounding production. One of Cameron's early works, and yet one of his best. The ultimate thing that puts this film on a whole another level above so many other flops is the awesome blend of realism and atmosphere. When I first saw it as a kid, it just felt so real to me. And now, ten years later,t that feeling hasn't left me. Using his camera in a way only he can do, Cameron instills a sense of dread in every scene, something good old Arnold did quite well.Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton also did extraordinarily so, just putting the right amount of emotional touches to their performances. Its an involving film throughout that never fails to hit hard, even in light of some terrible and CGI loaded sequels. And who could forget the score, which only added to the already excellent tension. My favorite scene? No doubt, in a disturbing way, the scene where the T-101 is repairing itself, and the lighting is just so perfect gives off a feeling of absolute fear. Or perhaps the scene in the club where Reese first engages the Terminator, either way ingenious and unforgettable moments in film history.A classic in every way.",10,14,17,3 January 2011
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Exceeded My Expectations!!!!!
","It is one of the greatest superhero films of all time. Luke Goss and Seth McFarlane are among the newest characters while Ron Perlman, Selma Blair, Doug Jones and Jeffery Tambor all return. The acting is great and comical and the cast is perfect. Marco Beltrami doesn't return disappointedly but Danny Elfman doesn't let us down, delivering a thrilling score. I don't know what's more beautiful; the symphony as the dead Elemental blooms or as Nuada crumbles into a pile of golden brown stone. John Krauss is an interesting character and I can't wait to see him in the next film ( that is if he isn't transferred to Antarctica).The story surpasses 'Hellboy' namely because we see 'Red' in the real world and it's a great ironic twist that the public doesn't view him as he'd so dearly hoped. We see his dreams shattered and Ron Perlman shows this just as I imagined it! The Golden Army looked incredible and the end battle was one of the film's highlights.This film also expands the universe of Hellboy and I really enjoyed all of the vivid sets. The creatures are amazing, from the 'tooth-fairies' to the Elemental to the beautiful freaks of the Troll Market, all are truly wonderful. Guillermo really has earned the title 'visionary'. Wink is a marvelous beast and his battle with Hellboy is one of my favorite sequences in the movie. The brutality fits in nicely with the comedy I have to say and the chain fist was a plus most definitely. Prince Nuada's character is one of del Toro's best villains, with spectacular motive and an emotional appeal that in the end makes us pity the fallen warrior. Abe and Nuala's love story is great and the climax is a tragic moment. The comedy is fantastically funny, by far the funniest when a drunk Hellboy and Abe sing a Barry Manilow duet! That part was incredibly funny and one of my personal favorite sequences in the film. The song itself is honestly catchy and you know it's true. But the story still retained its serious moments, delivering the emotions precisely at the right moments. Such as when Hellboy met his 'angel of death', a truly remarkable scene. The Angel of Death itself was stunning and the scene reminds us that despite his hero status, it is still his destiny to 'bring about the end of the world'.Ron is simply at his best and my expectations for Hellboy 3 are now higher than ever, but one can only wonder: How exactly will a pair of Hellboy-Liz mutts fit into the story? Most likely Guillermo del Toro has something planned. Yep, other than 'Dark Knight', this is my favorite summer flick. Totally exceeded my expectations!!!",10,5,8,9 April 2009
Cloverfield," Good and Bad Points
","This film may have been one of the most over hyped and especially over rated films of all time. The way it's shot was a clever idea and creates a sense of realism one could say. It certainly feels real watching it in a crowded theater. There are some scary moments and good terror scenes with our ominous monster and enjoyable characters even. However, I'm a monster movie fan, Godzilla being my #1, and this film was a little too short in my opinion. We never really get a back story of the monster or what becomes of it. Was it finally defeated or did it rampage through Miami next? Plus we never get to see the monster for longer than a few seconds without the camera shaking out of control. Very annoying. And did the couple survive or die like everybody else? Too many questions left unanswered for my taste but some will find it enjoyable.",6,1,1,25 May 2009
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," 'Boy, for a gunman you sure are pessimistic.'
","One of the best westerns of ALL TIME. When it originally was released, Roger Ebert was one of the few who hated it, even as to compare it to 'Bonnie and Clyde'. Now, I do acknowledge that the prior mentioned film is historically relevant because it sparked the end of the former Production Code and made violence 'cool', as well as popularized the French New Wave style of film making, but I didn't really care for that one. I'm all for romanticizing the so-called villains of history, but the tone in that film was way too hyperactive. One minute it was grueling violence, another it was comedic. All of a sudden you hear that comedic theme as they make their get-away. The reason I find this film superior is that tone is consistent, and the darker nature of it is much more subtle. For example, Katherine Ross' character, among others, constantly reminds our titular duo that their age of prosperity is over, though they never really seem to except it.Paul Newman is forever iconic as Butch Cassidy and Robert Redford no less as the Sundance Kid. The film's strongest aspect is the close relationship between these friends, and the tremendous acting really exemplifies this throughout. It'd be insane to try and count how many films have attempted to mimic this glorious and unbeatable chemistry between the duo, and on the opposite end just how many have failed miserably. The comedic nature of most of their dialogue is fitting and just so memorable, I dare to watch the film and not walk away quoting it. Like the sequence where the train robbery goes wrong and that haunting pursuit begins. Of course, there is that hilarious exchange with the assistant Woodcock (George Furth), but it leads up to one of my favorite series of lines between Newman and Redford; 'How many are following us?''All of 'em.' 'All of 'em? What's the matter with those guys?' I love how the pursuit was shot if you ask me, makes it feel much more personal and foreboding. Not to mention you get to see more of the glorious cinematography of Conrad L. Hall which captures the Western feel quite nicely. And oh yeah, this film is one of the few to pull off an anachronistic score so well. Before 'Spiderman 2' or 'Clerks 2', let be known this film made use of that oh so familiar song, and in the best way too.A+",10,1,2,20 March 2012
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Emotionally Powerful
","The finale of the original Star Wars trilogy!! The entire cast returns for a thrilling installment I must say. Mark Hamill is Luke once more and he looks bad ass in the all black Jedi outfit. Especially with the new green light saber, yes!!!! Chewbacca even gets a new hairdo, which I prefer over the 'greased' back look. But now let's get serious. The opening scene on Tatooine is great to say the least and Jabba's palace is excellent. When Luke enters it gets only better, the dark and mysterious entrance being great. Now a true Jedi, Skywalker has no need for a blaster and simply uses the force to silence his foes....PERFECT!!! The Rancor was a nice monster but the next scene is even better at the pit of 'Sarlac' where Luke nearly single handily defeats Jabba and co. The action here was great, Lando (Billy Dee Williams) having a bigger role in this film and I like his performance. Boba Fett seems to die, but if you're a fan ( a FAN- FAN) you know this isn't so.Any who, Luke visits Yoda on Dagobah for the last time and it is a sad moment. We learn Liea is actually Luke's sister so in the end it's a good thing they didn't get together (lol). Would've been kind of awkward if they had. Apparently the Empire has a new Death Star under construction and the Rebel Alliance mobilizes immediately to try and take it down before its completion. It is here my opinions jumble a bit...The Barc Speeder sequences are just incredible, my second favorite action scene in the film. The SFX here were simply amazing. Sigh, then the Ewoks arrive.. The admittedly cute little teddy bears totally backlash on the film's darker story. They somehow not only stand a chance but actually defeat the Imperial forces with minimal casualties, despite using rocks and trip wires! The tone is nearly ruined here thanks to the annoying Ewoks. At the same time, we have THE GREATEST LIGHT SABER DUEL EVER going on!!!!! Luke finally gives into his rage and attacks the Emperor, only to have to confront his father, Vader. This leads to one of the greatest duels in Star Wars history! It's emotional and cleverly choreographed and the music by John Williams is probably the darkest and one of his best pieces EVER!!!! Luke defeats Vader in a fit of rage, an excellent performance no doubt and the music continues to be no less than stunning. Darth Sidious, aka the Emperor, now prepares to kill Luke for his 'lack of vision' (my favorite quote of his) and the all the emotional turmoil finally ends as Darth Vader himself destroys his Master. We see his sacrifice and now realize he is no longer Darth Vader but once more Anakin Skywalker, and I just loved that part of the story. The music really embraced this moment and it all seems to be one of the greatest movie moments ever, until we see the Ewoks celebrating...damn!!! In conclusion, Episode VI is still emotionally powerful, has great action and compelling music, but the Ewoks still take a star off. 9 out of 10, not so bad.",9,3,6,11 April 2009
Pan's Labyrinth," Undeniable evidence del Toro Can Deliver A Masterpiece.
","A+ Up until this film in particular, many were quite critical of del Toro's work. 'Cronos' and 'Devil's backbone' are widely respected, but not widely known. Del Toro considers 'Mimic' a cluttered mess, while 'Hellboy' and 'Blade 2' are among his better known films. This is only natural as they appeal to the common movie goers' thirst for action but (me!!) find them more worthwhile with his artistic visual style. With this film I believe, it seems he pulled out all the stops for the critics.For starters, the cast is incredible. Main stream crowds are used to star studded cast in order to find in their perspective a good film. I will honestly say prior to this film, other than Doug Jones, I was unfamiliar with any of these actors. But regardless the performances are perfect. It is rare to find such talent at a young age, but Ivana Baquero does just that. She portrays innocence, tension and vulnerability, so many emotions the climax will bring you to tears. Maribel Verdu was more than admirable, but Sergi Lopez practically takes the cake. Of course far be it from him to over shadow the other characters. He's still perfect as our antagonist. Every time he enters a scene there's an aura of dread, as well as pride. Doug Jones is dubbed over to fit the film but his role is no less memorable. He plays near opposites, the Faun and the Pale Man, and yet he fills them with personality and zest.The story is just another well done aspect of the film. It takes a lot of inspiration from 'Devil's Backbone, mixing a child-like fantasy world with a grisly war-ruled one. However, that film was a well told ghost story; this something far different. It's a story of brutality, loyalty, to a degree sin, but over all sacrifice. All of these themes are present in both of the film's settings, which are intertwined. Never before has a fantasy film been presented in such away. Comparisons have been made of it to 'Narina' and 'Bridge to Terabithia', which is somewhat true I guess. But this is a much deeper and more involving story.Excellent photography as usual by Guillermo Navarro I must say, while the simple yet beautiful score provided by Javier Navarette is stunning. You could watch the film in isolated score and it wouldn't lose any of the tension, somberness or mystery and awe. That should really be a feature on the 2 disc, but alas it is not. And not even being a Hollywood spawned film, the visuals are fantastic and the lighting is never off. In short, Guillermo del Toro has created a masterpiece, one of my personal favorite films. A work of unimaginable are and an unforgettable story full of many well orchestrated themes and emotions.",10,4,11,27 October 2010
Blade II," Best of the Three No Doubt!!
","The best of the Blade trilogy no doubt, and one of my personal favorite films of all time!!! If you thought 'Blade' was a decent action flick, 'Blade 2' will blow your mind, proving effortlessly that it out does it's predecessor easily. WWWHy? Because one of the greatest directors has taken over: Guillermo del Toro! Guillermo really gives the film the tone the first one lacked, in pretty much every aspect possible. The lighting is more eerie, the villains much more threatening, etc., etc. First off, I love the cast!! Wesley Snipes and Kristofferson both return, both a host of new characters arrive, much more lively and likable ones to add to this. Where as Norman Reedus' performance is top notch and Leonor Varela is sexy as hell, Ron Perlman!!He steals the show in my opinion with his fantastic performance. It is characters such as the Blood Pack that make this film much more enjoyable than the first. The sense of conflict of Blade working with his own enemies to defeat a bigger threat, while still having its light touches of humor, is great. David Goyer really out did himself here. The art direction is stunning, from The House of Pain to the sewers, everything really sets the mood of the film as a scary-comic book come to life. Luke Goss as Nomak is dope and this time the end fight is truly pulse pounding! The pacing is better and the action seems literally non-stop. Also, we dive deeper into Blade's inner demons as he begins to challenge his hatred of his own kind and the story is simply great here. And the score is even better, this time Marco Beltrami being the composer. Tradgic, emotional, chilling, the score delivers the right tone at the right time. Such as Nomak, as when the audience finds out his true origins, the music is sad and remorseful for him, rejected by his own father. 'Blade 2' is definitely one of my top hero flicks of all time!!",9,2,16,18 July 2009
Alien," A True Masterpiece
","This film may just be one of the greatest sci-fi spectacles of all time. I remember seeing it on sci-fi when I was around ten or eleven, and sure enough that night I was terrified under my covers afterwards, keeping my eyes peeled for aliens under my bed. Or in the closet for that matter. But there are some classics that truly never die, this definitely being one of them.For one thing, the cast is incredible, including Tom Skerritt (Dallas), Veronica Cartwright (Lambert), Harry Dean Santon (Brett) and other A-list actors. John Hurt is Kane, our first 'chestburster' victim in the long line of many. And who can forget, the very sexy Sigourney Weaver as the unbreakable Ripley. Ridley Scott's directing gives off the sense of a horror flick but with far deeper characters and even takes us into another world that audiences will feel is real. I certainly felt so. Landing on the dark, seemingly lifeless, planet and the direlect spacecraft's interior, all beautifully rendered sets. Upon learning of the film's age, I was astounded at the SFX of a movie from 1979. People often remarked to this film as 'Jaws in outer space', but let's be realistic here. This film far outdoes the shark puppet of Spielberg's. The creature designs are remarkably eery and somewhat sexual, H.R. Giger having done quite nicely here. The alien, no more than a class act man-in-a-suit with some KY jelly for drool, gives the impression of a terrifying monster that both fascinates and shocks. And to add it all, Jerry Goldsmith delivers a chilling score that seals the mood of this film just the way Ridley must have envisioned it. A true masterpiece, 'Alien' will live on in even as the AVP films attempt to burn the 'Alien' legacy to the ground.",10,1,3,24 March 2010
The Town," Definitely Watch the Director's Cut
","I just wanted to say that on its own, the theatrical cut is a pretty damn awesome movie. Watching the extended cut is 10X even better. Simply put you get to see even more of the fascinating characters. Jon Hamm, while definitely playing the asshole, does quite nicely Rebecca Hall and Blake Lively are pretty awesome, the two creating a nice foil. And Peter Postlethwaite, rest his soul, is awesome in it. Jeremy Renner will go down in history as one of cinema's greatest bad-asses, that's for sure. And Ben Affleck, what can be said of Affleck? He not only starred in this, but co-wrote the screenplay and directed it. An aspiring Clint Eastwood figure? While films such as this are a great start, he has a long way to go before creating such a legacy, and he I hope he continues to make more great movies.Regardless, this crime thriller is definitely a masterpiece. Its heart-pounding action is backed up with an excellent plot and bold characters. Credit is also due to the original source material, Chuck Hogan's novel 'Prince of Thieves' (the author who has gone onto write the Strain trilogy with Guillermo del Toro). The score was also pretty great, by Harry Gregson-Willaims and David Buckley.Sure to become a classic.",10,4,5,20 March 2012
Full Metal Jacket," 'I love the commie bastards'
","Stanley Kubrick is one of the finest directors to have ever lived. He has made genuine and breath taking works of art in an each and every last genre, from sci-fi, to horror, drama and so forth. Naturally, when Kubrick took on a war film, it was bound to be stunning. The result is just as expected. It's pretty standard for people to distinguish the film as almost two separate movies. To me, that isn't so. The first 'half' is merely to show that the dehumanization starts in training. The inner demons, the act of killing, is brought out to its fullest by their Gny. Sgt. Hartman, played excellently by the awesome R. Lee Ermey. It is also clearly depicts that some men are not as attuned to this natural instinct as others, as seen in Private Pyle who's struggle to become one of these well groomed and structured killers leads to his untimely insanity. Vincent D'Onofrio was just plain psychotic looking, and was so damn good in his role, it frightened me. In a sick but all too true sense, the characters are trained to let go of decency, morality and mercy, as long as they accomplish their mission in the war.In reality though, who am I to say I'd live up to the 'codes of conduct' of war in the field? Who are any of us to say so? Many of us have not been in the heat of battle, had to watch our friends blown to pieces, or the fatal decision to take a life you really don't know. That is the struggle of Joker, who Matthew Modine played excellently by the way. The whole cast portrays this loss of human compassion that savage war has engraved in them. Aliss Howard as Cowboy was pretty good as well, but I loved Adam Baldwin as Animal Mother who has a understandably nihilistic view of it all. I'll never forget his helmet writing, 'I Am Become Death', from the Bhagavad Gita.It's incredibly hard to name my favorite scene, not just because there are so many to choose from but because of the disturbing content. Sure, there are small jokes here and there, but under lying the whole Vietnam segment is an atmosphere of a strangely accepted brutality which Rafter Man calls 'hardcore'. Whether it to be the scene of Sergeant Crazy Earl's 'best friend's birthday' or the Alabama black snake scene, it's all just great to watch. Perhaps it's Tim Coleri's scenes as the door gunner. As the bodies fall, all he can do is laugh and accept that war is truly hell. All together a masterpiece of film work and a war film that ranks among the best ever shot.",10,1,2,14 February 2011
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Remarkable Improvement
","Episode II may not be entirely perfect, but still, it is a huge improvement compared to the last one. Fans will cheer over the fact that Jar Jar Bink's screen time has been chopped in two, although he does play a major part in a crucial scene concerning the power of the Chancellor. Fans will know this signals the beginning of the Clone Wars, and the end of the Republic. I appreciate the film's darker tone. Anakin is now played by Hayden Christensen, who in my opinion portrayed the more 'sinister' side of Skywalker. Much enjoyed.In this film, Lucas also introduces new characters, like bad-ass Jango Fett and Christopher Lee as Count Dooku. Their performances are extremely well done. The mystery aspect of the film is something that I find adds much to the film and sets up the relationship with the original trilogy. We are also able to see more of Naboo and Coruscant, giving the film that same sense of awe and wonder the first three did. The action, which you do have to wait a bit for, is definitely worth the wait. Once the action starts, it doesn't let up, ending with an incredible lightsaber duel. Some will undoubtedly find Yoda's fight with Dooku laughable, but I find it modestly enjoyable. Despite being less than three feet tall, he truly is the most skilled Jedi Master who has ever lived.John William's does an excellent score, as usual, even providing a romantic theme for the love angle of the story. The problems I had this one, not much, it was just a bit slow at times. While surely not surpassing the originals, Episode II is still a remarkable improvement.",9,3,5,26 June 2009
Captain America: The First Avenger," 'There are always more workers.'
","C + Oh boy, Captain America. No, not Peter Fonda from Dennis Hopper's 'Easy Rider' but the patriotic mascot of Marvel. Yes, in the wake of the big super hero project 'The Avengers' there's been a lot of hype concerning Marvel in general, not to mention an upsurge in the sales of toys, lunchboxes and pencil pouches. 'Iron Man', even its sub-par sequel, is a pretty all-right movie, while Thor was just a god-awful mess of a movie. Its jokes were redundant, its action lacking and story pathetically clichÃ©. 'Captain America' reaches a middle ground. It is nowhere near as disappointing as Chris Hemsworth, but not quite up to par with 'Iron Man'.One big detraction is the on-screen combat of the titular hero and villain. Hugo Weaving is a great Redskull, very spot on, but he doesn't get to do too much. The final physical battle is a decent one, but that's all it is, decent. I enjoy the build-up to our hero's genesis, but its middle is annoying. We are shown an overly-long war bond selling montage, then we go more into his actual enlistment as a soldier, and then we break into a motorcycle flying out of an exploding warehouse. We see an action montage of various battles and I assume Hydra's various factories being blown up. Much of the cast was enjoyable and the majority of the movie prevails to be nowhere near as corny as the Norse thunder god-Natalie Portman love story.It's over all a decent hero flick, but nowhere near a highlight of the genre.",6,0,2,4 January 2012
Fargo," 'You should see the other guy'
","A+ One film that everyone must surely see at some point in their life is 'Fargo'. Far from a loud action movie while retaining the aspects of a crime thriller, it is above anything a black comedy film. The storyline is based as many know on an actual murder case, and yet the writing has this irresistible off-beat comedic dialogue throughout. Most of the humor is unexpected, coming at times when you least think it. The Coen Brothers have an un-dismissible knack for story and character writing that shakes things up.The incredible ensemble cast takes that screenplay and turns it into gold. William H. Macy is perfect as the quirky, shrewd schemer Jerry. The way he does it makes you feel sympathetic for his character at times, seeing as everyone just tosses him aside without a second thought. Peter Stormare spent most of the movie silent yet one could easily tell the character was a mad just because of that. Frances McDormand was pretty damn awesome as our main protagonist Marge, who maintains her composure no matter what she sees. With this film, it puts her on the list of great female roles, along the likes of bitch and Weaver. But even second to that, in my opinion, is Steve Buscemi, the 'funny looking' guy. He's in such sharp contrast to his partner that it easily makes it one of the most memorable crime partnerships ever; even if for infamous reasons.Going back to the story, it just twists and turns but you hardly notice it till near the climax. By then you realize the plan has fallen apart and that in effect all hell has broken loose. The photography by Roger Deakins also what help keeps the camera work subtle and you really are inclined to pay attention. Adding to all that is an awesome score by Carter Burwell that keeps the mood of the film constant. 'Fargo' is an undeniable classic",10,0,1,19 September 2011
Predator," 'I ain't got time to bleed' :D
","The original Predator film is a film that I hold close to my heart. It succeeds on many levels where many similar to it have failed, like it's disappointing sequel. I'd say to begin with it had a more than decent cast to play the roles. The story has them deliver catchy one-liners throughout, but you will thoroughly enjoy it. My favorite, 'I ain't got time to bleed', great stuff. But on a serious note, the story actually builds up the characters to an extent that we will actually care when they are brutally slain one-by-one. That is the single greatest failure of hundreds of films like this (like its sequel). There is a terrifying silent tension as well that adds to the atmosphere of it all.The music is pretty bad-ass, and I enjoyed it. The SX were also top notch and the predator was actually scary when I first saw it as scared sh*tless ten year old. I've seen the film hundreds if not thousands of times since, but it never gets old to me. By far my favorite scene had to be the chilling climax as the Predator prepared to kill himself and yet began to laugh quite like a human being. Downright awesome. This is a classic not to be disregarded.",10,3,4,22 November 2010
Watchmen," The Best Film of 2009 So Far!!!
","Tonight I witnessed one of the greatest movies of all time, putting Zack Synder on my Top Ten Director's List. Where could I possibly start? One thing I should mention that it will be a 3-hour sit during this one, but it's worth it because of all the intricate story telling that is both emotional and clever.Getting away from that, this movie is incredible, matching up to the 'Dark Knight' in my opinion. The story is incredibly dark and these characters are, if anything, as realistic as superheroes will ever get. Vigilantes and drunkees, set in a real world with common day problems. Unlike other heroes like Spider-Man who is absent during controversial problems, these anti-heroes have to deal with the horrors of war, violent riots and even attempted rape from other heroes apparently. Especially with the best of them all in my opinion, Rorschach, who discovers there is an ugly side to life and deals with it the way a real hero should; simply killing a child murderer right on the spot. It's a dark justice that we see in this film and that's why I like this character so much. When he died it was a moment of tragedy, the best of them all killed because of his stand for the truth. There is no sugar-coating of the real world in this film, as simple as that. Another great character is the Comedian. Jeffery Dean Morgan portrayed the character perfectly as a dark representation of America itself in my opinion. No matter how much you hate him, the anti-hero represents life's demons so to speak. The action is kick-ass and the visuals are even better. Dr. Manhattan himself is a reason to love the film and the 'love-triangle' is great. The atmosphere created by the dark story makes you fear for and actually embrace the characters, as I have. The score is beautiful and Tyler Bates delivers. The ending will leave you stunned to say the least and the dialogue is just as memorable as 'The Dark Knight' if I do say so myself. Synder did an excellent job bringing these characters to life and I will definitely see this film again. Having read the graphic novel, I can say it's a more than faithful adaption as well and the real way to experience it is the director's cut.",10,5,11,9 April 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Pretty Damn Astounding
","A There are probably those out there who would compare this trilogy of Peter Jackson's to the impact Star Wars had in the 70s and 80s. Some foolishly even say these movies surpass the classic Star Wars film. I maybe in the minority vote, but to me nothing can beat the original trilogy, NOTHING. I even find the second and especially the third prequel but to be quite excellent movies. I think everyone thinks 'The Phantom Menace' could've used some work, but there are still many parts in that film I particularly enjoyed, like the choreography of the end three-way lightsaber duel. But enough about the Lord of the Rings vs. Star Wars debate. Now the casting was primarily well done, Elijah Wood not being too bad an actor and naturally Ian McKellen was superb. Christopher Lee was also pretty solid, and though Orlando Bloom's character was a tad under developed I enjoyed him as well. Did I mention also the talents of Liv Tyler, Sean Bean and Hugo Weaving? And the cinematography was pretty damn good, plenty of amazing sweeping aerial shots, giving us spectacular views of the Tolkien book brought to the life like no one else could. The sets are amazing to boot, relying on more than just CGI thankfully. The score by Howard Shore is one of my favorite fantasy film scores I've ever heard, damn close to the best. It was elegant, dark, heroic, and the use of the chorus was just marvelous.The Black Riders were probably my favorite image in the movie, that and the Elf-witch going completely insane. There are some pretty twisted shots in the film, to my glee, Jackson knowing just the right angle every time. The story is long and tedious the first time around but after watching it enough times you really do embrace it. The scope of the story-telling is pretty epic, earning its place among my favorite fantasy movies. My only complaint would naturally be those damn Hobbits. Well all right characters, they due to get on my nerve sometimes. The Hobbits in general, in a worse inspiration from the Ewoks, always come off as more funny than dynamic, but hey there's so much going on I can't let that bring the movie down. There are many good action scenes to get us through this three-hour sit down, and very well staged I might add.It's about time a film did its original source material justice.",9,1,3,4 January 2011
28 Weeks Later," Not Bad at All
","For some time, I feared this movie would be a gun-ho, balls for brains horror sequel. The realm of horror sequels is populated by the great and terrible alike. Take 1978's 'Dawn of the Dead' as opposed to 'Poltergeist II'. Both of these are sequels to great classics, but they couldn't be farther apart in terms of quality. I'm glad to say that this movie is no 'Poltergeist II'. First big help, a really strong cast starring the likes of Jeremy Renner and Rose Byrne. Other cast members, including Robert Carlyle, Harold Perrineau, Catherine McCormack, Imogen Poots (I have a thing for her, can't help it) and Mackintosh Muggleton, do quite well at creating some interesting characters.The pacing in this film is different than the last film's, with less focus on the growth of the characters and more so on a race against time. To that end I'll say it's disappointedly not as nihilistic feeling as the first film, but it still maintains an atmosphere of dreaded realism. And I have to say this; this film sports one of the best horror opening s ever. Heart-pumping, well-choreographed, and a bad-ass way to start a movie. The score isn't as marvelous, but it has some marvelous usage of John Murphy's themes created for the first film. All in all, I highly recommend this sequel. Only thing that troubles me is the ending; did they make it or did they not? Guess that's part of the charm.",10,1,1,23 May 2012
The Thing," 'We're gonna see which one of us is The Thing.'
","A+ Not just my favorite John Carpenter film of all time, but one of my favorite films of ALL TIME. I'm very familiar with Carpenter's work, but this one takes the cake by far. Let me say right off the bat the cast is gold. Everyone gives very convincing performances, the top favorite of mine being Kurt Russell (obviously), Wilford Brimley and Keith David whom many may recognize as King in Oliver Stone's 'Platoon'. The story which is indeed a re-make in some regards, is by Bill Lancaster, and is extraordinarily well done. It's a familiar sci-fi/horror plot premise, but never done as well it is here, or since. It keeps you guessing right up until the end, and I don't exaggerate.The effects by Albert Whitlock and Rob Batitin are extremely bad ass, all before the times it got so easy with CGI. It's grotesque and beautiful all at once, being one of the high-points in effects history. The stop motion animation is one of the best of its kind, and continues to terrify. And to top it all off the legendary composer Ennio Morricone does the score. You might recognize the name from the Spaghetti Western glory days, seeing as he composed for all three films of the Man with No Name trilogy. The score is chilling and definitely one to remember.It's a spectacle in film history by many means, and I shall revere it eternally.",10,2,5,23 January 2012
The Hills Have Eyes," Horror Fans Are In For A Treat
","Horror films aren't much to get excited about these days as far as I'm concerned, but this one you'll definitely raise some heart rates. It actually raised mine, which isn't often. This movie plays off the radiation and A-bomb scares of those 50s and 60s sci-fi cult films, but it's the new millenia so get ready for something much more gruesome. The plot, as far as the setting, is predictable enough, somehow a family is trapped in the lone deserts of New Mexico, far from any reliable cell phone signals and civilization. The mutant people have decided to continue to live in these harsh conditions and have taken a liking to the taste of human flesh, although their sex drive apparently hasn't changed ( a disturbing part of the film I must say).The plot is interesting enough and you'll find yourself entertained. These mutants are basically a very mentally wrong group of people who definitely have some issues to work out. After ran-sacking their trailer and killing some damsels in distress, the a**holes even take the guy's baby daughter!! Oh hell no!! Time to get those f*ckers!! And so the father sets out to get his child back, with his trusted dog and bat. Meanwhile, the kiddies somehow manage to make a sophisticated trap that involves trip wires and an exploding trailer (How????). As a lover of sci-fi flicks, I'm usually not one to put a movie on blast for its realism, but when the kid had a gun with multiple rounds it seemed kind of overdone. Back at the mutant village, the dad is forced to confront a barrage of freaks and by the end of the movie is practically dead, taking more damage than I think a human can survive. But with a little help from a mutant who looks like red riding hood (the deformed version of course), he kills the remaining freaks in a blood bath. That's what you guys get!! I personally was rooting for the guy the whole movie and in the end it appears to be a happy climax..... Do I smell a sequel???",6,1,4,24 March 2010
American Psycho," 'I just had to kill a lot of people!' A+
","My Gojira, see this movie!! It is by far the best performance of Christian Bale EVER. I, like most people I assume, did not become familiar with Christian Bale till he became the new Bruce Wayne back in 2005. I was aware of this movie for a while but avoided it because I thought the acting would be dry. However, I finally sat down to watch it and was blown away. Its strongest pillar is none other than Mr. Bale. Trust me; you've never seen him like this. His character is sadistic, redefines cruel and is a true sociopath, and yet you can't turn away. Bale also adds dabbles of what seem to be regret within it all and it leaves one wondering; what will Patrick Bateman's next move be?It also offers the great performances of William Dafoe, and others. Taking place during the 80s, one can't help but feel Bale's character was driven to this sick path due to some feeling of social isolation. The 80s here are depicted as an era of the 'fast times'. A growing gap between the rich and poor (reminiscent of Oliver Stone's 'Wall Street'), people's ever growing affinity with drugs and of course the music that was there but also wasn't. In his meticulous mind, he appears to be the only one who seems to actually be paying attention to what he's hearing. Strangely idealistic and yet without direction, it's one of the strangest characters you'll ever see on screen.Bold, sickening and just exhilarating, check out 'American Psycho'.",10,0,0,10 July 2012
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Found It Enjoyable
","I'll say that for the most part this third film by Johnathan Mostow is pretty decent. He clearly made an effort to bring back the same atmosphere that was present in the first two films. This I very much enjoyed that aspect of it all. However, there is a somewhat diminished sense of realism in my opinion. This new terminator has flamethrowers and plasma cannons, built in of course. Oh geez... But I've come to embrace that actually. Except for that scene with KAte's 'fiance'. Didn't anyone notice a guy driving with an arm through his gut. Overdone...The cast is rather well put together, I'll give it that. Gool old Arnold is able to reprise his role as the T-101. Unfortunately this will be the final bout. John Connor is portrayed by Nick Stahil, and he does nicely. One other weakness to this film is the run time. The second film was over two hours, and there was plenty of action and what not. But there was still lots of time for character development throughout. We saw the characters' inner demons, you know? The story in 'Rise of the Machines' certainly has nice plot points, but their not used to full their potential. Not only that Kate Brewster's father and Skynet. We only see an early scene 'greeting' scene as a phone chat and short conversation about the system's dangers; and later the opening of 'Pandora's Box'. It was constantly hinted at that Skynet was already beginning its attack in subtle ways, so why not show a little more of the government tension? Getting away from that, the action is superb. Winston's studio does its job with artistic talent. I can say without a doubt the Terminators are looking better than ever. My favorite action scene by far had to be the hand-to-hand fight sequence. I find myself constantly rewinding it. Another plus is Marco Beltrami, one of my favorite composers. I'm definitely not let down. And so, Terminator 3 is an all in all decent contender, but it did not surpass either of the previous films.'Desire is irrelevant. I AM a machine!'",5,10,14,12 June 2010
"I, Robot"," GoodÂ…but Could've Been A lot Better
","C- For quite some time I struggled with the rating I wanted to give this film. Was it extraordinary? Or was it terrible? After recently buying the DVD and seeing it again, I've come to the final verdict. From my perspective, it had the potential to be the next 'Blade Runner'; whether you view it as a rip-off or just having striking similarities is up to you. Either way, the end result was a vivid script watered down to fit the summer blockbuster typical dismal flick. Will Smith is an exceptional actor, as well all know. But here his performance was like watching two different actors. I would say more than half the time Smith delivers clichÃ©, predictable comedic dialogue. For example, 'Oh, hell no!!' He then spends 30% of the movie giving us a deeper, more emotionally driven performance. The mix dilutes his character to the point Del Spooner is just another 'rouge cop' with a gun character, which we have seen a thousand times courtesy of Steven Segal and Shaft. Bridget Moynahan plays her role so dryly I really didn't end up caring for her character at all. Shia LaBeouf's presence wasn't necessary at all, basically just pointless. The best actors in the film were undoubtedly James Cromwell and Alan Tudyk, both who gave the film the intensity and mystery that keeps it weakly on its feet.One other thing I have to pick apart is the atmosphere doesn't feel all that futuristic. Only a few shots reminded me this took place in the future at all. One reason I rate it up in itself is because Marco Beltrami does the score, and so I was elated to hear it. He's never disappointed be it 'Blade 2' or 'Hellboy'. For instance, the thrilling climax at VIKI's main frame â€“tower-thingy as Will Smith slides down the (cables I guess) was an epic shot, but the moment is nearly stripped of all its power as Smith says, 'You so have to die!'. Wait, what the f*ck? Then a dramatic chorus plays as the nanites spread, but he damage is already done. While I find its worth checking out if you haven't seen it, don't expect a truly remarkable or ground breaking piece.",7,3,4,16 December 2010
Wanted," Not Perfect, But Still One Hell of a Ride!!! A Must See!!
","This film is great! While I'm not unaware the film has probably received some harsh criticism from a few critics, this film isn't one to miss, and that's for sure. The first reason to enjoy this film is because of Timur Bekmambetov's creative directing style. Seeing as the film is based more or less on a comic, one can enjoy its very comic moments, as I did. The characters are interesting and keep you hooked till the credits roll and trust me will not bore you. James McAvoy is perfect as Wesley and many other A-list actors manage to appear in this flick, including Angelina Jolie as the sexy Fox and Morgan Freeman as the plotting Sloan. The story is a crazy one at best, but it's good enough to sit through and it does have its moments. The ending is one that may or may not take you by surprise, but it definitely had me guessing. The comedy is well served in my opinion, one of my favorite scenes is definitely when Wesley expresses his true feelings to his 'anorexic' boss Janice and 'best friend' Barry. The action, as anyone watching the trailer could assume, is fantastic and pure adrenaline fueled technically impossible stunts. Quite a mouthful but one surely will not be disappointed with this aspect of the film either. Especially the train scene, INCREDIBLE!! Not only this, but Danny Elfman does an awesome score. 'Wanted' may not be perfect but it's still one hell of a ride and a definite must see. I can't wait for the sequel!!",8,12,18,7 May 2009
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Among Cameron's Best
","A+ Following the first film came a rare sequel indeed. It is beyond rare to find a sequel that takes it predecessor and expands it, deepens it, and ultimately surpasses it tenfold. And 'Terminator' was a good movie all its own. 'T2' does that in almost every way imaginable.With 'T1' we were left with a lot of unanswered questions, but here we get those and more. We have a very good cast rolled out here for audiences to enjoy, among them obviously Arnold and Linda Hamilton as a tougher Sarah Conner. Edward furlong is the legendary John Connor, a role that I doubt few of that time could fill. I won't drag this on any longer than I have to seeing as everybody's' seen the film by now. The thing that sets this film apart from many films is the characters and a well driven story. Most action films are easily forgettable with characters I could care less about. You're just there for the big explosions. But Cameron develops his quite well. And as the movie nears its end, we are left with a very good interpretation of who they were and why they did what they did. The terminator undergoes a complete transformation from the first film as a silent and menacing killer to a being we know is definitely not human but we care for it just the same. Exuberantly well done. That role is replaced by the T-1000, played by Robert Patrick. Even more menacing as than the first one really.The action is obviously well played, fresh and VERY intense. Unlike today's CGI over laden, over the top antics. An unrivaled achievement of film history and a legacy that lives to this day.",10,6,8,27 October 2010
Heartbreak Ridge," The Only Eastwood Film I Felt Lacked
","To date, it's the only sub-par Clint Eastwood film I've ever viewed. Eastwood is his usual bad-ass self, no complaints there. His ever impressive appearance and voice are ever potent, no doubt about it. See the film is beautifully shot, I'' give it that, but all the other characters are so over-shadowed by Eastwood. Some might argue, 'Hey, it's a Clint Eastwood film, you know, The Man with No Name, Josey Wales, Dirty Harry', but in all of those films his co-stars had very good roles as well making the whole story very interesting. The one-liners are definitely enjoyable, yes but I craved more out of the writing. The characters were so darn bland, and a few had little sub-plots but none were developed that well.The battle at the finale could've been a tad more intense, all leading up to a lack luster climax. If you came in just for the one-liners, as some tend to do with his films, then I guess you'll be satisfied. As for me, I was expecting much more.",6,0,0,20 March 2012
Salt," I Tire of This
","I enjoy the espionage genre, in the light of films like 'Taken' and the like, but this came off as laughable. I thought Hollywood was done portraying Russians as America-hating, vodka-drinking terrorists, but I guess not. The film has a few good twists, but none so extraordinary that i was in awe. And a lot of the action scenes are so generic, predictable and annoyingly unrealistic. How many times have I seen a CIA agent who leaps off a freeway over pass and land son a convenient truck? Not to mention the constant one a gent who always pulls the trigger first, who always beats the sh*t out of fellow agents with moderate ease. You would think our government would give all their secret service members the same training so that one of them would not be superior to whole squads of others. Not only that, but I don't care how sexy Angelina Jolie is, can any woman really take all that abuse? I mean over all it's just a popcorn flick, but I just tire of all this.A mediocre film I don't really recommend, unrated edition or not.",5,3,6,20 March 2011
Apocalypse Now," 'Horror and moral terror are yourï»¿ friends. If they are not, then they are enemies to be feared. They are truly enemies.'
","A+ The 1979 Francis Ford Coppola legend, it's definitely a must see. There has been many a film to depict the nightmare that was Vietnam, among the most popular being 'Full Metal Jacket' (1987) and 'Platoon' (1986). They're all incredible films, my personal favorite being 'Platoon' (William Dafoe just won my heart), but when it comes to striking visuals this one takes the lead. The film is saturated with low-key lighting throughout, quite literally giving the movie the feeling of a horror story. The screenplay is greatly inspired by Joseph Conrad's novella 'Heart of Darkness'; hence the majority of the movie takes place on a fictional river. While certainly a historical piece, the focal point to me would be the inner true savage nature of man which is brought out to the full by the war's onslaught. The notion it seeks to point out is that man has tried to 'domesticate' war, and to an extent their drive to kill. That is what Marlon Brando's character so vividly mocks; the top brass' attempt to make warfare humane. Though some consider his character to truly be insane, I believe he's simply 'a puppet who can see the strings'.The cast is pretty exceptional, with Martin Sheen, Laurence Fishburne, Robert Duvall as the odd Kilgore, and Dennis Hopper in similar role to the one he had in 'Easy Riders' (1969). And who could forget Sam Bottoms as the acid-tripping soldier who by the end of the movie had not much of a mind left. Adding to this is the psychedelic score by Carmine Coppola, which fits the time yet hasn't aged in the least. In fact, it adds dread to the atmosphere, a dread I honestly haven't seen in a war film since. But above all, I can say the film probably has the most epically shot battle scene of all time when it comes to war movies. Everyone knows it; in fact there was a nice little homage in Zack Snyder's 'Watchmen' (2009). The timeless Wagner piece 'Ride of the Valkyries' plays as long shots show the extensive damage and mayhem. The music, the quick-cutting and the cinematography come together to make a perfect scene.'Apocalypse Now' is a Coppola spectacle.",10,1,2,23 January 2012
Edward Scissorhands," One of Tim Burton's Best
","By far one of the best films by Tim Burton, besides my personal favorite the original 'Batman'. Where does one begin? Obviously, Johnny Depp! His performance is one of passion and clever simplicity. Portraying Edward as a modern incarnation of Frankenstein in a way, viewers can actually connect and come to love him. We worry about him just as much as we would any ordinary character. In fact, even more so.Another remarkable aspect of the film is the very unique world Burton sets up. A mix of the suburban 50s and a sense of dark, Gothic almost, style imagery. It actually fits the film quite well, one reason why it's so easy to love. Plus the score by Danny Elfman is one of his best, perfectly matching any emotion the director wants to depict. Elfman never lets us down, that's for sure. All in all a very well made film put simply. Although Kim's boyfriend's dialogue is at times questionable, it didn't ruin my experience.",9,1,3,25 May 2009
Van Helsing," A Must For Fans of Classic Monsters and Modern Audiences Alike
","Stephen Sommers once again takes a classic horror film refurbishes it into a modern action flick. I find it a very well made film actually. Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale star in the lead roles and they both portray their characters excellently. Van Helsing had always been an interesting character to me, seeing as he's been in nearly every film Dracula has (besides 'Blade: Trinity'). I was wondering when they were finally going to make a movie of about him. Finally, the day came. Jackman is perfect for the role. Also starring is David Wenham, who provides a lot of the comic relief in the film. This film too me wouldn't be what it is without his comedic elements, seriously. The visual effects are incredible, especially with the werewolf transformation scenes, astonishingly real. The end fight between the Hugh Jackman Werewolf and Dracula is by far my favorite scene in the film. The CGI, lighting, and brutality of the fight all come together excellently here. The story was incredibly well done by my standards, including elements from several of the classic monster movies, even 'Dr. Jackal and Mr. Hyde'. The only one Sommers did leave out was 'Creature from the Black Lagoon'. At the same time don't expect a true classic like those films, but merely an action movie of Sommers material.The action is adrenaline pumping and impressive, although the carriage scene is at times a bit over the top. The only other things that bug me is one, that ball room scene is never really explained. So were those all of Dracula's victims from over time, as I'm guessing, or what? Plus, how does one of those egg pod thing things even fit out of a bride's V-JJ, or in her womb as apparently, according to Frankenstein, they have several in one birthing. And they constantly hint to how Van Helsing got this amnesia, as if there is to be sequel or something, very distracting at times. Getting off those subjects, the music by Alan Silvestri is very well done and fits the film perfectly. The music at the climactic battle is one of the best pieces he's done in a while, especially as Van Helsing realizes the horror of the things he's done ( if you don't know what I'm talking about, see the film). Excellent SFX and action, but many a plot hole, 'Van Helsing' is still quite the fun film.",7,1,3,26 June 2009
Spider-Man," Sam Raimi?? You Did Good!!
","Along with 'Blade 2', 2002 unleashed another superhero blockbuster 'Spider-Man'. The popular comic book character is brought to life and Sam Raimi brings it to life exceptionally well. The characters are now on the big screen just as they were in the comics, something fans will for sure enjoy. This movie takes the simple idea of the 'accidental superhero' and it turns into something people of all ages will appreciate. The mild mannered Peter parker is played by Tobey Maguire who actually turned out to be a good choice. The rest of the cast is also well assembled, with James Franco, J.K. Simmons and Rosemary Harris.The drama is very well played and I believe audiences will enjoy watching Peter Parker's journey from ordinary nerd to a nerd with super powers. Cliff Robertson, playing Ben Parker, was great in this film and his death was a truly sad moment.Playing our villain is Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn, a.k.a. Green Goblin. It is here we first a lot of CGI being used for the action but it works very well. Spider-Man swinging through New York looks remarkable and the stunts are amazing. The Green Goblin suit is actually very different from the one seen in the TV shows and comic books themselves. It's very mechanical, looking much more like armor. It is a change that many like myself don't mind at all and other than that the villain remains the same, a psychotic terrorist. Plays the role of Spider-Man's enemy perfectly. The portrayal of the character's insanity is done just how it should've been. Danny Elfman is the composer and Spider-Man's theme sounds heroic most definitely. It seems he has a thing for hero films, starting since the original 'Batman' back in 1989. Who would've guessed that Sam Raimi, the director of the 'Evil Dead' films, would be able to make such a well made film. Sam Raimi, you did good.",9,1,2,24 September 2009
Jarhead," 'F*cking kill ME!!' A+
","One of the strangest war films ever, and I gladly say one of the best. Directed by Sam Mendes, the film wreaks of his visual feats. It's not often in this genre we are treated to such dream-like moments, but that is Mendes' specialty and he sneaks them in with great subtlety so it doesn't distract. The first thing you'll realize after watching the movie is that it's one of the few war films that depicts very little actual combat. This movie depicts the Gulf War, and manages to be quite clever in its theme, masterfully subtle. After so much training, so much hammer-like conditioning, these Marines find themselves having this programming denied to them.Jake Gyllenhaal's character represents the non-conformist who can see the string he's being lead on and he suffers internally for it. That is the sum of his beautifully played character. Some people watch the movie walking away with the simple assumption it's portraying a day in the life of a Marine, but it's really doing more if you look deeper. With great visuals, like the burning oil fields, and the spectacular performance of Jamie Fox, this is definitely not one to miss.",10,0,1,10 July 2012
Collateral," 'It's only a dead guy.'
","I'm starting to more and more notice Michael Mann. I know many see him as merely a director of action films and while many of his films sport dazzling spectacles of bullets and body blows, he makes sure characterization is first and foremost. That's the focal point of this movie: character. I've watched the documentaries exemplifying how much of a background Mann gives the characters in addition to Stuart Beattie's original screenplay and its astonishing. Of course, on camera only so much can be put in to keep the film streamlined. That's Mann's style; still each character feels very fleshed out due to not just the dialogue but their subtle mannerisms.Jamie Foxx honestly surprised me with his performance. He played a withdrawn character and perfectly so. Jada was pretty damn good, and so was Mark Ruffalo. Practically taking the cake though is Tom Cruise as Vincent. In my opinion its one of his best roles ever. Nihilistic, logical and best of all a cold-hearted efficient killer, this character is a testament to a downcast ideology but one that is impossible to dismiss. Well done, Cruise, well done. The movie is basically a tale of different lives suddenly becoming intertwined.A damn good movie.",10,2,2,10 July 2012
Aliens," Surpasses the Original
","Grade: A +James Cameron is the genius behind this masterpiece. One of my Top 15 films ever, I saw this film only two years ago actually. Does it surpass the original? A question I pondered for some timeâ€”that is till I discovered the existence of an extended cut of the film. And so with that 'Aliens' has become the victor.Before I say anything else let me say I Love our cast. Sigourney Weaver is back as Ripley, the stone wall character who decides to leave behind her nightmares and conquer them. Soon though she finds it'll be no easy task. Michael Biehn delivers the famous line, 'I like to keep this handy for close encounters.' Gotta love the duo of Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein) and Hudson (Bill Paxton). The bond between Ripley and Newt, played by the young Carrie Henn, is a pivotal point in the film, showing that human affection can outweigh even the darkest and deep set fear.Another point worth bringing up is the art direction and sets. Cameron made sure he lived up to the original's greatness in this regard. All throughout the film darkness is prevalent and it terrifies the audience. The cast only compounds the tension. The xenomorph design has been modified, but they are looking better than ever. For 1986, the Queen is very well done herself. Hearing that ragged breathing, seeing that humongous crest, the beast is overall imposing. In fact that must be my favorite scene, that final battle is f*ckin epic. LV-426 is now a colony and that alien nest has got to be them most chilling set in the film.The soundtrack is eerie and fits the film perfectly, even without Jerry Goldsmith. To sum it up, one of the greatest sequels ever, a fusion of sci-fi, drama, and horror that will leave one stunned. If you haven't seen it I highly recommend the extended cut.",10,1,2,3 June 2010
American History X," A Film With Obvious Meaning
","Without a doubt Edward Norton's best role, never to be surpassed. The same nearly goes for Edward Furlong, but I'm still contemplating on that one. Nonetheless, both will never be forgotten as roles of nightmarish realism. A reality that some believe to have died off with the rallies and marches in the 60s. But it is alive and well, even in the hearts of some of today's unfortunately misguided youth. The story, as it progresses, expresses one fundamental idea. Ones does not simply wake up and accept the fact that there a fired up racist. It is a seed that starts out small, and is nurtured by those who do not know how to lead, or have their lost their own way. And then, at a certain point, it is fed like a fire needing fuel. But just like a flame, it can always be extinguished. Lots of symbolic stuff, huh? Well, one picks up these things after watching the film several times. Racism is not an inherited fundamental theory. It is a learned trait. The film's director Tony Kane and writer David McKenna worked hard to deliver this theme. As far as I've read at first there was a much more edited and toned down version to be originally released. But thank God that didn't happen. I also give praise to Anne Dudley's score, pure emotion if you ask me. An A+ plus no less.",10,1,4,29 September 2010
Saw III," The film is basically for those aroused by gore
","Well, as in most horror franchises, we have an awesome start, a crummy sequel, but those writers and producers just keep on pushing! The story is ridiculous and rather horrendous. Predictable, I wouldn't say that, just, really, really, REALLY, dumb. Jigsaw is on his death bed in this one yet he keeps on coming up with these nifty little traps and what not. Oh yeah, and an unlimited number of warehouses, and an unlimited bank account to buy all these damn things and Amanda is so loyal you'd swear Jigsaw was actually paying her some of this money. And finally, the guy seems near omnipotent. The only thing he somehow did not predict was Amanda killing off the survivors, convenient right? Do yourself a favor and watch 'Funny Games' and treat yourself to something truly diverse. Far from a true horror, mystery, or thriller, let alone a real film for that matter, The film is basically for those aroused by gore. It simply has nothing else to offer.",4,2,4,8 November 2010
Pearl Harbor," Explosions are COOL!!
","Michael Bay hit an all-time low here, honestly. Usually I can let go a lot of his ridiculous and overdone humor and action sequences due to the fact the stories he tell are of course fictional and hold no real relevance to mankind other than entertainment. But this, especially in the light of the much more realistic'Tora! Tora! Tora!', had already been released, is just plain offensive. Bay delivers a story that is just overloaded with plot holes and historical inaccuracies. It literally feels like a slap to the face; as if Bay was really in such a rush to honor the victims of Pearl Harbor that the studio and crew didn't even check if the damn screenplay for the many errors within it all.Not to mention the love story is poorly executed and overly drawn out. Cuba Gooding Jr.'s character was the only historically relevant in the whole film, and yet his role is more of an after thought. Then he treats us to his usual explosion filled action sequences, which were hardly the point of any war film ever made, so to make special effects the focal point of a war movie instead of the characters and atmosphere was just plain stupid. 'Platoon' had a budget I hear of only around $8 million, so how exactly did a movie with more than triple that fail so badly?",1,9,15,3 January 2011
Tropic Thunder," Possibly One of the Best Comedies of 2008!!
","Damn, 2009 has two contenders for best comedies of the year!! This is surprisingly pulled off largely due to Ben Stiller, who wrote, directed, and yes, duh, starred in a leading role. What we get is somewhat a parody of Hollywood and its stars today, especially with the first few opening scenes; which includes the film's highlight (lol), a advertisement for a energy drink vividly named 'Booty Sweat'. Effin hilarious!! The entire time this movie is rolling you will be dying with laughter. It's just that funny.Though is also due to the fact that we have mainstream actors, who usually see in dramas and action flicks, starring in rather ridiculous roles. Such as Robert Downey Jr. 'who's playin' a dude pretending to be another dude who's actually another dude.' Lmao, but still, he's an Australian actor who went as far as to get surgery in order to play a black character, a gig he holds up till near the climax of the film. Others such as Tom Cruise, Matthew McConaughey, and Nick Nolte also star. This is one of the most star studded comedies you'll ever see.The comedy regulars also appear, of course, what would the film be without Jack Black, in the film a crack addict of all things. Also is Danny McBride, who also starred in 'Pineapple Express'. This film is nowhere near as violent as Seth Rogen-and-James Franco duo but nonetheless has some decent action in it. It seems these days directors believe audiences would like an overall mixing of action and comedy, which to me is all good. And the audiences don't seem to mind either. In the end I seem to favor 'Pineapple Express', but don't get me wrong, this film is definitely not one to miss either.",9,1,3,30 December 2009
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Ugh...Eh
","D+ I don't see why one would praise this movie. It starts off as a teen melodrama, though its video game-like visuals I must admit were amusing. Michael Cera plays the same role he plays every damn time he's handed a role; the pathetic loser. Christopher Mintz-Plasse, not to go back to the all-too familiar McLovin role, is a general sense a likable nerd niche character. Cera's roles are just annoying. He ranges from a sniveling coward to a stuttering and indecisive would-be sweet talker. It's not a case of the same sh*t, which I can take, it's a case of the same annoying sh*t.After a while into the film, after meeting the no doubt adorable Mary Elizabeth Winstead, out of nowhere comes Satya Bhabha flying thru a wall and then a very lame fight scene takes place. I love the colorful cinematography, I really do, but the action just isn't all that amazing. The whole movie, its trailers and various articles all seem to anticipate these grand and elaborate fight scenes with the 'seven evil exes'. It captures the comic book feel, yes, but only in a childish manner due to the gentleness of the fight scenes. Put in short I never feel our main protagonists is any real peril. I whole heartedly believe in disowning realism in the name of poetic license (being an avid fan of Godzilla here, enough said), and yet this film goes so far over the top they kill any possibility of creating tension. The cast had some very promising stars, such as Brandon Routh and Chris Evans, but their roles are so over-the-top there's no real threat. Sure, some of the comedy is sort of funny, but over-all the script was absurdly weak. The best joke in it all would be that the 'power of love' got Cera's character killed, but the 'power of self-respect' leads to victory.About the only real theme I took to heart was the growing simplicity of contemporary music, akin to the twins' techno vs. the hardcore punk band scene, but it just doesn't hold up. I've read some graphic novels in my day, among them 'The Dark Knight Returns', various Deadpool comics, Hellboy graphic novels and yes the Kick-Ass and Watchmen graphic novels, but if the Scott pilgrims are really as pointless as the movie then I'd sadly say I'd have to pass.",5,2,4,4 January 2012
The Usual Suspects," 'The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.'
","A+ I haven't looked much into the mystery genre, but I must say this film drew me in with ease and intrigued me even more so once the credits rolled. I definitely recommend viewing it more than once, because seeing it just one time is nowhere enough to soak up all the details. With each viewing you pick up more, and, as I have, garner a greater appreciation for this movie. It is helmed by Bryan Singer, who directs his films by focusing on atmosphere and character.The characters are very interesting ones and the performances are pretty awesome. Stephen Baldwin (McManus), Kevin Pollak (Hockney), and Benicio del Toro(Fenster) are very good at their roles. Pete Postlethwaite was excellent as Kobayashi with his icy composure. The film mostly centers on Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), a man of a dubious past and even more threatening cunning. Kevin Spacey is as talented as ever, giving off the fragile nature that mask Verbal Kint, and Agent Kujan's search for the truth of what really happened on that bloody night at the harbor. Despite many of these men appearing imposing the brilliant screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie cleverly turns the con men into pawns of a much bigger ploy than they planned for. And before I forget, John Ottoman is a grand composer, creating music that is chilling and never overplays the moment at hand.It's such a great mystery that the film will turn your many assumptions on their head multiple times. It is a thinking movie, and those looking for mindless action should look elsewhere.",10,0,0,14 July 2011
Independence Day," Hollywood Budgeted Massive Destruction At Its Finest
","C- Lo and behold, it's the only Roland Emmerich and Dean Delvin film I actually care for. I saw it at a young age, and have seen it well over twenty times if not more over my years. If you, especially like me as an aspiring film maker, take a gander over the pair's many productions over the years, you'll realize the actual amount of creativity and talent they have can fit inside of a pin head. Their movies are predictable and serve merely as popcorn movies. As far as revolutionary sci-fi goes, it only qualifies in the category of special effects and nothing more. Of course the ships target the most popular cities first, it's movie's basics. My sole praise is to the obvious that of the extraterrestrial ship and body design. Naturally, my favorite part is the alien autopsy scene, the amount of detail put into the creatures. The film's use of miniatures is appreciated as well.As for the characters, Jeff Goldblum is pretty decent, and Will Smith is the usual gun-ho protagonist. Mary McDonnell and James Duval also star in not too bad of roles. The performances don't bother me; it's just that I'm not emotionally invested in the characters because I know who's going to die and who's not. To truly experience a modern sci-fi achievement, check out 'District 9', a text book example of a fresh take on aliens, or in my humble opinion Steven Spielberg's 'War of the Worlds'. Roland Emmerich and Dean Delvin's at their finest, if that really say's much but a good ride.",7,0,1,14 July 2011
Alien vs. Predator," If You Though Alien 3 or Predator 2 Were Bad......
","When I first got news of this film, I was excited by the concept. Two sci-fi legends going head-to-head in the ultimate clash of the century, who wouldn't be interested? However, my dreams were crushed two minutes into the movie. Paul W.S. Anderson obviously was high while writing and directing this film. What other explanation could there be such a horrid film? With this film, it is proved 'Alien 3' and 'Predator 2' truly are not the worst installments in the two series. The story is awful, installing all this b.s. mythology that contradicts itself at every turn and if anything confuses the audience from the start. The cast is one of the crappiest ever and none deliver the thrilling performances I was expecting. Most people will find the characters boring and will be begging for them to be the next victims. And the PG-13 rating really limits the action, which is stupid because every film before this in both series is R-rated!! Sigh, the only high point is the xenomorph and predator suits and effects, which were dope. The first meet scene was the only part of the film I truly enjoyed and after that, yeah... go watch 'Aliens' or 'Predator' to wash this crapfest out of your head.",5,1,3,25 May 2009
No Country for Old Men," 'I laugh myself sometimes. Ain't much else I can do.'
","A+ The Coen Brothers have definitely caught my eye. I know they have an impressive career, but this film is my favorite of theirs. It has the cinematography and location of a great modern Western, the lighting of a film noir, and the great dialogue of a Coen Brother film. The difference though is that 'Fargo' (another Coen brother favorite of mine) is a dark comedy-drama, and this film, as the Coen Brothers put it, is about the unstoppable evil'. Playing that evil is Javier Bardem as Anton Chigur, and he's one of the best movie villains I've ever seen. The theme of the movie, as in the book it is based on, is the decadence of our country. Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones are subject to this. Those expecting a traditional morality tale, the triumph of good over evil, will not find it here.I find that the majority of the viewers say that they love the build-up of the movie, the pacing being perfect, the action great, and the drama well-written. What they often say they can't stand is the ending. Without spoiling the climax, I can understand where they're coming from, but I have to disagree. Anybody who watched 'Fargo' for the first time surely didn't expect the brand of comedy the film dwelled on. In the same light, viewers of 'No Country for Old Men' should expect the usual guidelines to go right out the window. As a true film lover, the ending, no matter how against your wishes it maybe, try to keep this in mind: the filmmakers are attempting something different, something bold. I learned this lesson the hard way some time ago when I first viewed 'Arlington Road'.Also, kudos to Kelly Macdonald, who did an extremely well done job, and I love Woody Harrelson no matter the film. And despite all the film's seriousness, it does have a touch of comedy with the MacDonald character's mother, played well by Beth Grant.",10,4,6,23 January 2012
District 9," The BEST sci-fi thriller in a long time!!!
","I just saw this film Saturday August 30, 2009 and I'm definitely impressed. This film went way beyond my expectations I must say. Beyond 'E.T.' and 'Independence Day' that's for sure. The amount of realism is excellent and one can actually find this plot very believable. This film is a mixture of 'The Fly', 'E.T.' and a few other great sci-fi pieces, all blended together into a an actually very different film if you ask me. Neill Blomkamp did a great job here, creating a real sense of emotional tension rarely seen in sci-fi films these days. The film's odd yet unique choice of setting is one thing that sets it apart from other alien flicks that simply don't compare against something like this.The story is extraordinarily well written and the characters are very moving with bad ass performances. Sharlto Copley , who plays the main protagonist, is a great choice and I love his role in the story. I don't want to spoil it since the film is still pretty new but you have to see this film!!! The action and drama plays as well as the sci-fi classics such as 'Alien', original 'Star Wars', and 'Terminator 2'. In reality, I won't be surprised if this film is soon considered one of these classics. Even as the film ends, one is so thrilled most, like myself, are praying Peter Jackson will provide some sort of sequel.",10,3,7,30 August 2009
Batman Begins," Batman has returned and is better than ever!!!
","The 90s Batman films were works of art, but unfortunately went to crap once the third came around. That's usually what happens when we bring in a new director more often than not sad to say, but its true. But with 'Batman Begins', Batman is truly reborn, no lie. We have a spectacular cast assembled here, with Christian Bale as the Caped Crusader, Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon and Michael Caine as Alfred, excellent choices. I do consider myself a fan of Batman, being my favorite hero and all (I use to watch all those Batman shows that were great if you ask me), but I am unfamiliar with some of these characters, such as Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) and Luicus Fox (Morgan Freeman). Luckily, thanks to Goyer's story, these new characters fit in perfectly. The story of Bruce Wayne is told perfectly and one can really feel his pain and struggle to find his true destiny. I feel the wait is totally worth it and the audiences will enjoy watching Bruce's journey to becoming the dark knight.Liam Neeson stars as Ras Al Ghual I'm glad to say, and his performance, as usual, is incredibly done to say the least and I love Cillian Murphy as Scarecrow. The villains are just done so well I'm really impressed. Good job Christopher Nolan!!! The story is excellent and makes sure each character, hero and villain alike, plays a crucial role we all enjoy in the dramatic climax.The new Bat suit is kick-ass, although the 'bat-a-rangs' aren't used as much in this movie. Whatever, because the new Batmobile, or Tumbler actually, is just awesome! The chase sequence is one of the best action scenes I have ever seen and was just jaw-dropped by it. Of course, Batman kicks a lot of ass, just great stuff if you ask me. Gotham City itself sets a dark aura over the film, and we really understand why Batman does what he does.The music by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard is powerful and drives the emotion in the film no doubt. Batman's new theme is dope and the score is often dark and somber. This score matched Batman perfectly.Batman Begins brings back Batman better than ever!!!",10,2,3,7 April 2009
Saving Private Ryan," Good But There's Better B+
","Before there are any misconceptions, I do like this movie. I find it one of Spielberg's best, one of the unforgettable period films of the 90s. With the likes of Tom Hanks, Barry Pepper, Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns and a surprisingly good performance from Vin Diesel (can't believe I said thatÂ…), the acting is pretty damn good. It's recreation of D-Day is probably its strongest scene by far, setting the tone perfectly: sacrifice. The many battle scenes are done without a hitch and there are great strides in the history of war film effects. John William's music is encompassing and well done, not one of his best but still very good.I have but a few problems with the movie. One, its moral quandary is supposedly the sacrifice of many for one. However, the question honestly seems self-defeating. Why, you probably ask. Because the movie seems to seal this moral lesson in quite frankly one of the most obnoxious characters ever: Upham, played by Jeremy Davies . I'm not sure what the point of his character was. For some time he's a morality tale lifeboat who boast about the indecency of killing soldiers who surrender, fine and dandy, living up to the codes of conduct and what not. However, during the big finale, this character proves to be little more than a coward who's failure to act cost the lives of many. And I know, I know, it in a way simply portrays tragic irony and the confusion battle brings. But the end result, with Upham finally doing what he should've done in the first place seems, dare I say, pointless. After the whole movie seemingly supporting mercy, what was with the sudden redundancy of the message? It seemed the majority of the characters died for reason not even our film makers understood or mixed up.I've been told this is what you call a 'pro-war' movie, and to an extent it is. All in all, despite its mixed up morality, the film is still one I enjoy though.",6,2,3,5 July 2012
28 Days Later...," Pinnacle of Horror
","Director Danny Boyle's creation is one of true genius. He's done what so few horror films have ever done, cementing the characters in the audience's hearts. The movie is not so much a zombie-flick but more of a drama infused with horror while telling a tale of the all-too real fall of man. Cillian Murphy was awesome, along with Naomie Harris and really the whole small cast is just overwhelmingly great. The characters are built up enough to feel a cringe in your heart when their in peril, and yes, this film will nauseate you with it's not just its gore but its horrifying look at humanity. It's not only a survival story, but one that questions mankind's place in this world.Not to mention John Murphy's score is absolutely stunning. It literally gives one chills, encompassing fear, pain and over all savagery. The film's moments of silence are even more unrelenting in their magnificence and quiet terror. It really stands out as a different type of horror that some main stream audiences may not like because it actually has plot, which is turn off to most popcorn movie goers. However I can't stress enough that this movie is definitely worth seeing and I will amaze you.",10,2,3,4 July 2011
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Here Come the Money Shots!!
","Here comes the sequel to an epic. Steven Spielberg is back and what we get is a mixed bag. I saw it as a kid and naturally loved it. But as we grow older, so do our knowledge and need for probing. Some cast members did not return and weren't even referenced to at all in the story but other aspects in this film make up for it. Jeff Goldblum does reprise his role and I'm quite happy about that. Julian Moore and Vince Vaughn star here, but to me the actor who really caught my eye was Pete Postlethwaite, as Roland. In terms of story this film was definitely built as a thriller. A lot of the story is non-sensible, as I'm sure you've read. The boat somehow guiding itself back to the exact spot where it was destined via no pilot (or maybe auto-pilotÂ…), an experienced mercenary on an island full of flesh-eating dinosaurs wandering off just to take a leak, with Juan listening to his MP3 trying to catch a baby dinosaur when I'm sure you heard its enraged father is right behind himÂ…eh, the list goes on give or take. Basically this purely a money-shot type of film. We do see a bit of a deeper side to Goldblum's character and that does add a bit of zest to it all. A lot of the other characters are mildly gone into, just barely enough to get a sense of who they are. But suckers like me to this day end up caring for them. Ha-ha Decent characterization at best.Once again a riveting score by John Willams, but in all fairness we get no real time to appreciate it. The SFX of course good as can possibly be, but we established that in the first movie. In America what movie doesn't have good SFX? That's why I don't care when people say Godzilla films SFX are terrible. Because I LOVE dinosaurs I give it a 7.9, around a near B-, but no doubt still a keeper by far. I proudly own the DVD as part of my collection.",8,54,67,30 September 2010
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," 'Nooo!!!'
","I've been a fan of Planet of the Apes since I saw the original with Charlton Heston as a child. Since then, I saw to it that I see each and every last one of the films, and I've done so. Though they got zanier and zanier as time went on, I still found the science-fiction enjoyable regardless. I mean they had some interesting, though I'm not denying cheesy, plots to watch. Then came the 2001 Tim Burton re-make, which I'll admit was an enjoyable film all in all. The problem was it dared to actually call itself a re-make, even though it was a mere action-thrill ride sort of film. That's not bad on its own, but compared to the original one can't help but complain. Why, well mainly because the original had so much going on in-between the lines, it was a very thought provoking film which is why so many regard as it as a masterpiece.This film thankfully does not aim to be a re-make, at least not directly. If you're a fan such as I then you'll know its premise is very similar to the 1972 film 'Conquest of the Planet of the Apes', though there NOT linked directly. This is need I remind you a reboot. Director Rupert Wyatt creates a nicely paced plot, not as subtle as the original but not a mindless-action oriented as Burton's film, a nice middle ground. Although it doesn't exactly dwell on the inner demons of humanity, the film does deliver emotionally and that's probably its strongest point. Like the 2001 film, the effects are dazzling, but are put to much better use. Andy Serkis, not surprisingly, plays the role of Creaser and quite well. The animators made sure to pay attention to the facial detail, sealing the deal with a nice range of emotions. The cast is also well done, with the likes of James Franco, John Lithgow, Fireda Pinto and (YES!) Brian Cox. The tension is carried out perfectly and the homages are a great touch. Like the early 90s Batman films compared to the new Nolan films, today's audience require a decent level of realism, and the film handles this quite awesomely. The concept of super intelligent apes rioting in our streets never has been so well depicted.Definitely check this one out, total A.",9,4,7,22 February 2012
2012," When Will Roland Emmerich Learn??
","When will Roland Emmerich and Dean Delvin learn?? I guess when they finally run out of disaster ideas. They already ruined Godzilla, capitalized on global warming and had aliens take a shot at world domination. It's only natural that he'd hurry up make this film before a director with actual talent got a chance too. After watching those barely acceptable films, along with '10, 000 B.C.' in all its maligned light, I honestly didn't have high expectations for this film. And what a coincidence, the duo presented audiences with a predictable and overly done action sequences.I can't lie say there aren't some captivating and mouth-dropping shots, but the humor seems to never let up. Even as the world crumbles to pieces and society is at the end of its rope. A perfectly good time to tell a joke or to, don't you think?? The same old formula of a divorced family getting back together after the step father is conveniently killed during the chaos is put to use, yawn. As a result I end up not giving a rat's *ss about any of the characters. In fact, it would've played out better if everyone would've simply died. How many clichÃ©s and comedy must I suffer???!!",4,3,4,19 April 2010
Ghost Rider," Worst Super Hero Film Ever!!!
","Perhaps the worst comic book flick ever? HELL YES!! I was expecting much more from this film, seeing as it was one of my favorite character's film debut: Ghost Rider!! That's the film's only high point come to think of it, how incredibly bad-ass he looks. Mark Steven Johnson, the director of 'DareDevil', what the @#$% happened man? Were you high? And if so, how high? Now let's get down to the bad points, and trust me there are several of them. First off, where did the director get the idea to give the entire film this western theme? It ruined the whole movie!!! And worse there was still a super natural, horror-side, to the film, creating a very bad mix. Secondly, very little action honestly. The few fights with his enemies are far too short and I was feeling quite bored more than half the time. Thirdly, Eva Mendes and Nicholas Cage do not make a good couple, what-so-ever! It was annoying o watch their on-screen chemistry because there was none going on! Normally I don't look forward to a nude shot of Eva Mendes ( not that I mind them though) in one of her roles but this film needed one just to break my boredom. Unfortunately there was none!! WTF??!! Hope to God there won't be a sequel, I beg you!! But on a serious note this is just another example of crazy possibilities ruined by horrible directing!",3,2,4,18 July 2009
X-Men: The Last Stand," Good But Flawed Compared To The First Two
","Damn, why is the third film also where things go downhill? 'Mummy 3', 'Spider-Man 3', 'Jurassic Park 3', and now the X-Men series joins the list unfortunately. This is undoubtedly due to the absence of Bryan Singer. Singer wanted to fulfill his dream of directing a Superman film, therefore released the same year as 'X3' we receive 'Superman Returns'. The better of the two in my opinion would definitely be the Man of the Steel. The main problem is a very rushed story given no time to develop these insane new mutants. Not to mention Night Crawler, who was such a remarkable character in the last film, is completely forgotten. At least a cameo would've been nice. Pushing that aside, this film serves up some very well done action scenes, and I love Juggernaut! The Golden Gate Bridge sequence was an amazing sight that showed us the power of Magneto. However, even here, director Brett Ratner felt it was necessary to shorten things. If you buy a copy of the DVD, as I'm sure most fans did, you'll see an enormous amount of deleted and edited scenes. All this cutting shortened the film and just took away from the depth of the characters if you ask me. Plus I was somewhat disappointed by the end battle on Alcatraz. Sure there were several baddies against a few heroes and there are some well done moments, but it felt too easy. Few of the mutants stood a chance against the formidable X-Men, making it feel as if the superheroes were up against an army of regular men and women.In other news the score by John Powell was fantastic, but overall when the credits roll, one can't help but ask: 'It's over already?'",5,1,1,13 May 2009
Hellboy," A True Genre-Bending, One to Remember Del Toro Flick
","When I first saw the trailers for this flick I knew I had to see it!! Guillermo Del Toro did a fantastic job of bringing Mike Mignola's comic to life. For years I had always wondered how a Hellboy film would look, seeing as the comic was different than traditional superhero comic books. Thankfully, the director doesn't let us down. But who could play such a role? Ron Perlman answers the call and it's because of him that many people like me have come to love this film. He plays Hellboy jut right, delivering the right comic touches. But that's not to say the rest of the cast isn't up to par.Selma Blair, Rupert Evans, all are superb. I love the conflict between Hellboy and Jeffery Tambor's character and add tension but also comedy. Kronen is my favorite villain in the movie but the real highlights are definitely the fights with Sammeal, the one in the subway being the best action scene in the whole film. To add to this there are some great sets and one can easily tell this a Mike Mignola adaption. One has got to love the BPRD (Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense) sets, especially the library one. Marco Beltrami completes the movie with a bad-ass score and I certainly hope he returns to do the sequel's music. Overall this film will appeal more to specific audiences then to main stream ones, but I think everyone will find something to enjoy in it. A true genre-bending, one to remember, Del Toro flick.",10,3,3,24 March 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," When One Thought It Couldn't Get Any Better
","A+Definitely among my personal favorite films, LOTR 2 is as good if not better than the last one. Now the main reason why it's better: story is already in motion thanks to the first film. Secondly, just a whole lot less of those damned Hobbits. Still, there are some funny moments, like Sam uttering 'Your Sam.' I don't know if it's a running gag to insinuate this almost romantic relationship between the two, but it shall pass (kudos to McKellen). Thirdly, the sense of doom created by the images is quite awesome. The acting was once again class A work, and there were some interesting new characters. I particularly like John Rhys-Davies as TreeBeard, and loved Andy Serkis as the twisted Gollum. Plus David Wenham was great as always. Orlando Bloom's character delivers plenty of action, quite the bad-ass really. And Gimli of course was the ever constant comic relief. He does get to kick quite bit of ass despite all this, so it's a okay in my book. Once the action starts, it never lets up. And Peter Jackson's cinematographer doesn't let us down with some amazing cinematography and breathtaking shots. I mean the end battle is truly one to remember and was probably among the most epic battles in fantasy history. The amount of time, craftsmen, and effort put in by the production team and cast is definitely worthy of note. The Battle at Helm's Deep will surely go down in cinematic history as one of the most beautifully orchestrated climaxes ever. Howard Shore's score isn't as dark and as menacing as it was in the last film, but still very, very, good. And so with all this, a very good film is born worthy of recognition.",10,1,3,7 January 2011
Schindler's List," 'I didn't do enough.'
","Surely and undoubtedly one of the greatest films of all time. Steven Spielberg's greatest, no other film has depicted the suffering of the Holocaust so hauntingly vivid and realistic. Despite the horrors we all know took place, Spielberg is relentless with the graphic images we see, only furthered y the black-and-white visuals. The evil, sadistic nature of the Nazi cult is shown without refrain. What I particularly liked about this film was how it showed the degenerative effect of murder on a man's sanity, personified best by Amon Goeth, who was played brilliantly by Ralph Fiennes, becomes a truly inhuman monster.This is without a doubt Liam Neeson's greatest role that he has ever played. He is debonair as Oskar Schindler, yet riddled with grief and guilt as the film goes on. Human geed becomes human compassion, as a ray of light against the black darkness of the Nazi hearts. And Ben Kingsley was just marvelous as Stern.And John Williams scored the film beautifully. There is not an easily recognizable leitmotif style he uses here. The music is used only here and there, to capture the realism but when you hear it you know only Williams could be behind such a radiant and somber score.As I said before easily the best movie of all time.",10,29,48,5 January 2011
The Incredibles," Not All People make It Out To Be
","Probably my least favorite Pixar film. When I go to see a kid's movie, especially a Pixar one at that, I come in foremost expecting a fair amount of comedy, but with excellent character development and whole hearted emotion. No to mention a good score is a must. This film just tried too hard to be an actual action flick. It seemed to forget that it is, after all, a family movie. Not for the fact that it was too gruesome or something, come on, its Disney but where were the laughs? For the longest time in this drawn out film I was bored with it all. If I want to see a superhero I will actually go see one, not this! Also, I was rather surprised sometimes at the not-so-subtle sensuality at times.The plot, something Pixar usually stands out for amongst the wannabes, falls incredibly short. Syndrome killed off hundreds of heroes, to perfect his little doomsday droid so he could build himself a utopia of superheroes like himself. Eh, decent at best, but the main problem was the cast, aside Mr. incredible. Everyone else aside him, and I guess Syndrome, were left completely undeveloped. Unlike in 'Toy Story', 'Bug's Life' and 'Finding Nemo', where you left the theater with a sense of awe, wonder and feel-goodness, I just left this one with 'blah'.In the words of 'Finding Nemo': 'What a pity.'",6,2,4,22 November 2010
I Am Legend," One of Will Smith's Best Performances Ever!!!!
","This film is one remarkable masterpiece if you ask me. Dramatic, visionary, yet delivering comedy at the right moments, 'I am Legend' presents one of Will Smith's best performances yet. The story is solid and never fails to keep our attention to say the least. The total highlight of the film in my opinion would definitely be the empty Manhattan, which in itself will send chills down one's spine. Francis Lawerence brought this concept to life just the way it should've been. Will Smith really out does himself here. The emotion he puts into his performance is astounding and he portrays the last man on earth perfectly. I myself was actually brought to tears when I first saw this film in theaters. And trust me that's a rare thing for me! The way the action is shot makes the whole movie feel more realistic in a way and the terror is unrelenting. And with a tragic and well done score by master composer James Newton Howard, this 'I am Legend' is one of my favorite films of 2007.",9,1,3,25 August 2009
Dog Day Afternoon," 'I like to get kissed before I get f*cked.'
","A fantastic film coming from the direction of Sidney Lumet, I'm surprised the name isn't more famous. Starring the incredible talent of Al Pacino, John Cazale and Lance Henriksen, Charles Durning and more. Each performance is breath taking because no character is dull or without flavor. The amount of plot and dialogue mix together so well it gives the film a true sense of realism, one not many films these days can muster. And the pacing matches perfectly because despite its length the movie never feels long. In its sheer brilliance the plot never sits still. I find it better to go into the movie only knowing it's a 'bank robbery' and just that. As the movie goes on, you get the sense it's about more than just money.Speaking of which, another great aspect of the film is how it captures the anti-establishment mood of the 70s, as well as portrays the terror even the criminal goes thru in a tense situation ('Don't take the car, we need the car.'). This is not 'Die Hard', this is not 'Swordfish', and these are real human characters that you actually feel connected to and embrace. It's impact after viewing never loses its potency.",10,1,2,17 March 2012
Kick-Ass," Holy $hit!!!
","Well, holy $hit!! I'm in love with this film, the whole genre of more realistic and more graphic hero films set in motion by 'The Dark Knight'. Howver, this one revolves more around the teen style seen in 'Spider-Man' so to speak. But in a more graphic and brutal manner you've got to love. I'm whole heartedly surprised that such a comic existed but I'm glad that it does and even more glad the film was theatrically released and just as brutal.The cast is so vibrant and the choices could not have been better. Aaron Johnson as our title character, he does a superb job portraying the average American kid. There is no 'I will avenge you!!' or 'radioactive spiders', but he wants to be a hero simply because its cool. Who hasn't? The story takes that concept and somewhat expands it and what you get is a an awesome and original story for once. Chris Mintz-Plasse is casted as Red Mist, who is the son of our main antagonist (Mark Strong). He couldn't be more hilarious and yet an obviously conflicted character, facing the choice of justice and his father's praised life of sin. Nicolas Cage is finally in a role in which I actually like his character. Recently I've been finding reasons to hate him. What a redemption!! Got to love the constant in-joke of his out fit's resemblance to Batman's, but a true fan knows otherwise. It's all in good fun.Perhaps the most talked about character and my personal favorite is Hit Girl, played by Chloe Mortez. For such a young actress she has plenty of spice and I'm beyond impressed. Often her lines are far too vulgar for this review to quote but buy the DVD because it is on sale already if you didn't know.Far beyond comic relief though, Mortez is the ultimate bad-ass. The character has an air of intensity that oddly flows with her frail and deceptively weak appearance. The movie spares no profane word and the action is just the way I like it the most: gruesome. the drama is well-payed and the humor fits in quite well. You quickly find yourself caring dearly for these characters and will enjoy every second of them. Comical yet so close to reality, and yet so bold and unique. One thing I also must say is that the choice of music is just phenomenal. 'Kick-Ass' takes the super hero genre and blends it with realism seen rarely in this genre of movies. A well put together masterpiece really.See it. Love it. =]'Switch to KRYPTONITE!!' A+",10,20,36,26 August 2010
Gran Torino," Clint Eastwood...A true Icon
","I just bought the DVD and finally saw this movie. I won't lie, this film could easily surpass each and every last one of the film Eastwood has ever done. And that's saying a lot, seeing as this film would have to contend with 'Million Dollar Baby' and 'letters from Iwo Jima', to very formidable opponents.Once again he is at the helm as both director and the lead role, which hep lays with the gruffness of everyone's favorite 'Dirty Harry'. His performance is non-stop exhilarating, brutal, yet with a heavy heart that's endured plenty. Bee Vang was extraordinary throughout with an unbelievable break-out performance, as well as Ahney Her. The story is a moving one full of dark humor, as well as an atmosphere of unbelievable tension. Clint Eastwood once again has created a masterpiece.",10,1,5,13 December 2010
The Hurt Locker," 'I'm ready to die, James.' A
","The focal point of this brilliant movie is the character of James, played extremely well by Jeremy Renner. The foil to his character is Sergeant J. T. Sanborn, played by Anthony Mackie. Within these two characters are two completely opposite dispositions concerning the soldier psyche pushed into combat. The opening quite sums up the entire movie really. Sometimes the rush of battle consumes a man, and to no end. One of the greatest aspects of this film is how it re-creates the fear of life-threatening situations modern day soldiers encounter.We also get the sense of aimlessness, such as the scene where a bomb capable of killing many is in the middle of being defused and yet there are people filming the crisis as if it were a mere show. It kind of brings one back to 'Full Metal Jacket' when one soldier remarked 'Here we are dying for these people, and they think its one big joke.' The struggle between duty and survival is a constant factor, making this one of the great war films of recent years. I highly recommend this one.",10,0,3,27 June 2012
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Let's SeeÂ….
","F+ You'll only be entertained if your under the age of nine to be honest. The first film was somewhat decent, but this one fell flat on its face. It's basically a big budget cartoon, although that's not even fair to say seeing as many Marvel cartoon series are actually rather good. So, I'll put it like this, some cartoons have more substance and are frankly more mature than this joke.It's run time is absolutely pathetic, so nothing is built up as it should have been. Some character moments are just plain stupid with dialogue so crappy you cringe a hundred times by the time the less than 90 minute film is over. Tim Story, our idiot director, made Johnny Storm annoying to the point I wanted him to sacrifice himself instead of the Silver Surfer, and Jessica Alba is just her normal ditzy self. None of the heroes interested me and the humorÂ…wasn't all that funny. The only interesting character was the Silver Surfer but he's killed off pretty quick before we got a chance to anything about him. A score that was as forgettable as the rest of it all as well. I have completely lost faith in any hope of a truly good 'Fantastic Four' film.",4,2,5,22 November 2010
Transformers," Michael Bay Finally Accomplished Something!!,
","After several mediocre films, Michael Bay finally accomplished something!! This film is his first generally well done film. The story is very nicely done, but the movie's obvious highlights are the incredible action sequences. Thanks to the miracle of CGI, the kids TV show is now looking better than ever. The transformation shots look remarkably realistic, my favorite being being Bonecrusher's on the freeway, followed by an amazing battle. Megatron, along with all the autobots and decepticons, look bad-ass. Starscream, as he was in the show, is my favorite out of all of them, and we all know he's going to be in the promising sequel. They all have personalities and one can actually connect to the giant extraterrestrial robots, as I'm guessing most audiences did.The cast I find a good one, with Peter Cullen voicing Optimus Prime! Shia LeBouff is excellent in his role, and Megan Fox of course is sexier than ever. I believe the comedy fits in nicely with the action, unlike in 'Pearl Harbor'. Still, there was that scene where where the soldiers lost their little Mexican buddy at the battle with the scorpion thing and later on Josh Duhamel remarks 'This thing is wicked!!'. 'Wicked' ??? After it killed your fellow soldier right? But since its this type of film it can be let go. Plus, especially at the thrilling climax, it does have its serious moments. The score by Steve Jablonsky is fresh and I love it by the way. All in all, with 'Transformers', while not entirely free of flaws, Michael Bay finally serves up a film that is exciting and well-paced.",7,1,3,11 May 2009
Men in Black II," Satisfying Sequel
","B- Will Smith, Johnny Knoxville, Tommy Lee Jones, Rosario Dawson, and even Michael Jackson (ha-ha-haÃ‚â€¦) were up to par here. It took a second viewing for me to really appreciate the film, but it really is a straight comedy spliced of course with sci-fi. The 'worm guys' are probably the best characters in the whole movie, being so outspoken and well portrayed. The story is a brisk one, but it delivers nicely in my opinion. Perhaps many felt the empty feeling when the movie was over was that the story moves along way too quickly, and I suppose it could've been longer, but it does just fine.The action sequences are generally well done and each has their own bit of quirky comedy, which leads me to the alien designs which once again will definitely aspire a second look or two. One can really get a tone for the film by Danny Elfman's score, considering there is no real emotional strong point in the music; one can technically expect the same from the movie. While the sequel may lack some of the scares and better told mystery, it's still a enjoyable laugh.",8,3,7,30 September 2010
Million Dollar Baby," One of Clint Eastwood's Best Works
","This film is one of Clint Eastwood's best films ever!!! The story is simple but draws you in and never let's go. The characters are simply too thrilling. Hillary Swank steals the show a bit with a sad and brutal story of a very tormented woman's life with incredible power. Enough to bring viewers to tears in fact. Morgan Freeman is great as a supporting actor and he definitely deserves some recognition for his performance. Clint Eastwood himself deserves an Oscar for his excellent directing and own spectacular performance. His role was perfect, creating a strong yet vulnerable character people will embrace. The climax will touch you as his character is given a choice that decides life and death. The score is moving in itself and I simply love this film.",10,7,9,25 April 2009
Mulholland Drive," 'I had a dream about this place.'
","Mulholland Drive ( David Lynch, 2001), one of the most ambiguous films to be unleashed upon contemporary audiences, dare one say 'abstract' even. In an era where simplicity is preferred over mystery and intrigue, the average audience member may find such a film angering in all respects. It resembles the classic noir genre, in so much that the infamous street Sunset Boulevard even appears in the movie as an ominous homage to the Billy Wilder film of the same name. Like that 1950 film, this movie's themes and tone is dark, but nowhere near as formulaic, per say. Classic film noir still relied on a certain pattern of events and character niches; the femme fatale, the unsuspecting victim most often our male protagonist and of course the incorruptible detective figure. This narrative method follows the invisible style, making it generally easy to understand. Mulholland Drive breaks many of these rules without a second glance, clarity being at the very bottom of its intentions if at all. Director David Lynch sets this in motion in a number of ways.The music by Angelo Badalamenti electronic yet menacing, and creates a mood of a near horror-film like aura.One of the most startling traits of Mulholland Drive is its complete disregard for the traditional Hollywood narrative style. Clarity, it ignores in throughout the movie, as new characters and plot lines are constantly introduced, some not followed up on till much later. The unity is leaves one even more bewilderment. Over an hour into the movie one still has no real idea how all these characters are connected, and certain events and objects even mean. The characters themselves are left to the willful imagination of the audience, as the story progresses it giving off the feeling of a mystery combined with pressing psychological puzzles. The goals of the many characters are very obscure, and the threatening world around them is even more mysterious. As for the style of the story telling, many of the house hold techniques are used: such as the foreshadowing when the ominous stranger, Louise Bonner, warns Naomi Watts of impending 'danger'. Closure is practically rhetorical in the film and in the same sense as Donnie Darko (Richard Kelly, 2001) most is left to the viewers to discern.In the same fashion as Sunset Boulevard (Billy Wilder, 1950), one of the focal points of the film appears to be the decadence of Hollywood. The overhead shots of the city are accompanied by surreal, nightmare like music. The top brass of the industry appear inhuman, pompous and over all intimidating. Note the low angle shot of the apparent executive Mr. Roque. We rarely seem, and when we do no other figure is allowed to be in his presence apparently. The portrayal of Hollywood has many homages to the way it was portrayed by Wilder; with the apartments being dirty looking with their drab browns and dirty to look everything. In the daylight scenes, where it can be hard to use low-key lighting without delving into the extreme-gloomy Tim Burton trademark, the cinematographer Peter Deming uses this filthy look to the setting to establish the dark mood. Another particularly hard-hitting aspect would be the loss of innocence. As Naomi Watts rehearses her role with 'Rita' (Laura Harring), she delivers the dialogue in an overly-loud clichÃ© manner, but in the rehearsal with the studio heads, she becomes a whole another person it seems. The medium shot of the first rehearsal is replaced in the second one with a sensuous medium close-up, and the excellence of her acting there is fueled by pure unrestrained sexuality. Compared to her naÃ¯ve depiction up until this scene, one would struggle to connect the two scenes.This is just a small taste of the complex mystery world Lynch sets up in his cryptic film. Lighting, setting and the way the characters act still are saying something, but the way the plot moves makes it a struggling endeavor to understand. In all its zaniness, one important theme to grasp is the freedom of artistic tactics in film making. From the dawn of Hollywood to this day the general consensus is that everything must be immediately understandable with only one possible interpretation. There is no such rule because the clarity of the movie is unrelated to the art of it. The way the film is edited, credit to Mary Sweeney, plays an undeniable role in the film's perplexing beauty and terror to an extent.",6,64,107,3 December 2011
The Evil Dead," If You Haven't Seen It, Then you Haven't Really Experienced Horror
","I find the overwhelming majority of modern horror just plain deplorable, clichÃ©, and dull compared to this film. For such a small budget, it set a bar so high hundreds of films have failed to even come close to its greatness. Right off the bat I'll say that yes, the acting could have been more solid at times, but it doesn't distract at all. Bruce Campbell already stands out a bit from the others in my eyes, although he does vastly improve the quality of his performance in the sequel. The cast here is secondary, the atmosphere set up by the very creative and clever photography being its strongest point. Tom Philo came up with interesting visuals, under the guide of Sam Raimi. Our director creates a true sense of terror and helplessness just from the way it's shot, for example one of the opening sequences as the characters arrive at our cabin. It's just so ominous.This is greatly helped by one of the few good horror composers, Joseph LoDuca. The music was chilling and got to your nerves every time you hear it. The effects are good old 80s material, which I prefer when it comes to the horror genre. CGI can ruin an otherwise good horror film; alas 'I am Legend'. The makeup was gruesome and the photography effects just plain scared the hell out of me! The movie hits you hard with excellent carnage and some very disturbing shots, like that infamous tree scene. It's disturbing yet funny, to really sum it up properly. Raimi pokes fun at the genre while serving up stunning cinematography making just a fun movie to watch over and over. By now I doubt many haven't seen it, but if you haven't then you have not truly experienced horror.",9,1,2,22 November 2010
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Another Very Well Done Tarantino Film
","I had always heard great things about this movie, but for a long time I was hesitant. I was born in 1992, so I'm kind of back tracking threw film history so to speak. Seeing as 'Pulp Fiction' had been so well done, I decided that this film should be just as exhilarating. And to my pleasure I must say what audiences get is a very different type of movie, let alone martial arts film. So many movies today lack any real style, this was just awesome to watch for that reason alone.This movie tells a revenge story that is obviously heavily influenced by 73's 'Lady Snowblood', and to very good effect. Tarantino shows a clear deep respect for the film, especially threw Lucy Lui's character O-Ren Ishi as well as Uma Thurman's 'The Bride'. The characters here are much better drawn out and are played very well, each with their own interesting story line. The opening fight is amazing and manages to sum up all these different emotions into the first few minutes of the film. It's quite frankly impossible not to enjoy the rest. Uma Thurman plays a character known simply as The Bride, who will have to face down some of her former allies who apparently double-crossed her for leaving the DiVAS (Deadly Viper Assassination Squad). Among her foes are great actors including Vivica A. Fox and Michael Madsen, all leading up to the final confrontation with Bill, played by David Carrdine. And although you have to wait till Volume II to see that, this film sports some heavy-hitting action. It reminds you of those classic kung-fu and samurai movies done with a fresh twist that leaves you amazed really. The violence is cartoonly overdone, in the same light of many of those epic and very bloody classics. It's a factor I actually enjoy and the Crazy 88 battle is for sure one thing among many: crazy!! The music, some of which is provided by the RZA (!!), is original and I must say our director has an odd but well placed taste for this department. Along with the humor, Tarantino also does his usual out-of-sync time line gig, which is a tad distracting in this film upon first viewing, but you'll appreciate it more every time. The thing about this film is that it pays much deserved tribute to a category of films that are so under appreciated these days, to see it in American cinema done so artistically was just fresh, involving and unique. way to present",9,1,3,24 March 2010
Saw II," Oh gee
","F Well, I tried to get the most out of the first Saw film, with its decent plot and unexpected twists. But in the end, mediocrity is, after all, mediocrity. There was little to no tension in this garbage. The believability of it all is at an all time low compared to the last film. The logic is just terrible. The whole story had to deal with these victims having these numbers to their salvation on all places their necks. So, first off, why was the guy motivated to kill everybody? Insanity and desperation; that was the excuse I assume, but still wouldn't it have been a hell of a lot easier to simply ask for the numbers instead of killing them off? It would of token a lot less killing, chasing, and overall effort, not to mention time when it came down to it. The plot hole is so big it's more of a gaping wound dripping with stupidity. Then a poorly delivered twist; Amanda is his apprentice? Wait, what the f*ck? OkayÂ… oh yeah, and I guess the whole moral reasoning behind this is that he wants to teach people the value of life? Let's be realistic here, would I really have found any meaning in all that suffering other than it's a sick world and that I wish I could get my hands on that sadistic bastard? If you're into BDSM then you will enjoy it however.",4,1,1,8 November 2010
From Dusk Till Dawn," One of the Funnest Horrorr Films Out there
","From the creative minds of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino comes this odd flick. I stumbled across it on TV and was fairly intrigued so I watched the encore presentation. I was actually pretty thrilled by it. The movie starts off with the guise of a genuine Tarantino flick, with great dialogue and the tense atmosphere of a tense crime thriller you could say. With acting presence of George Clooney, Tarantino himself, Harvey Keitel, and Juliette Lewis, it flows quite nicely. Plus, f*ckin Tom Savini!!! Film scholars and fans of horror will nod their heads in agreement. Then enter the lusciously delicious Salma Hayek, and from then on you are thrust into an entirely different film. It's this transition I believe that throws many off, but it works due to the performances and the thrill of the action.The film loses its sense of seriousness to a degree, but it serves up quite a bit of bloody, gruesome yet funny action. For what it is, the film is very entertaining and very different from what you usually get. I was excited to hear there were two sequels, but they're as dismal as the usual trash. 'From Dusk till Dawn' is a truly unique horror experience.",9,1,2,16 December 2010
The Dark Knight," Will Blow You Away!!!
","I once more saw 'Dark Knight', and I'm still just as impressed. Seeing the film twice really broadens the view and the message only sinks deeper. It really is one of the best films of all time. Dramatic, action-packed, clever writing and artwork directing, with the Joker's oh so menial touches of humor, all come together as the best film of 2008 in my opinion. And with such an enormous box office success, obviously America agrees as well. And now owning 'Batman Begins' also helps me understand the sequel more thoroughly. Gotham's fight for hope, Bruce and Rachel's tragic love story and the ultimate choice if Batman is really the hero the citizens of Gotham need and deserve, all these problem's still threaten and entwine our characters for a ride audiences are sure to never forget.Batman gets a makeover of course, as all heroes do for their sequel. The new Bat suit looks incredibly bad-ass and I love the whole armor look of it. The Bat-pod had a nice entrance and was a suitable replacement for the Tumbler. Once more the Bat-a-Rangs are put aside, not even used at all but whatever. There are plenty of new gadgets that will thrill audiences. I miss the bat-cave, which this time around is a smaller basement of sorts but it's all good. After all, it still looks good, right? Harvey's struggle to maintain loyal to justice is an exciting plot point, Aaron Eckhart delivering an ace performance I must say. I wish Katie Holmes would have reprised her character, but instead Maggie Gyllenhall got the job. It's not the acting, I just find Holmes cuter and not as old looking but I digress. Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman all return thankfully and every actor's performance was excellent. Heath Ledger (RIP) gave one of the best of all time, no doubt. Psychotic yet mentally captivating would be the choice words I'm looking for. Goyer's complex story is filled with so many intricate details, all leading up to the decision of right and wrong, a true story of morality. Rachel's death was conceived perfectly and a silent Batman standing on a pile of rubble was just iconic. The clever and kick-ass action really blow you away, being so extraordinarily done. And without too much help from oh so precious CGI, the action is even better-looking. Which is my favorite action sequence in the whole film: The Prewitt Building scene or the SWAT car chase one? I really don't know but both, once again, WILL BLOW YOU AWAY!! The action is great but director Christopher Nolan relies not only on that sole factor, but the sadness and troubled lives of these characters to capture the audience. Not only that, but the music, once again by the duo of Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard, was fantastic!!! Sad, dark, thrilling are only a few words to describe this soundtrack. The Joker's theme itself was great, really adding to the character. The list of reasons of why this movie is so great could go on forever, but I'll keep it at a paragraph or two.",10,2,5,9 April 2009
2001: A Space Odyssey," Daunting Imagery And Sounds
","This movie, one of Kubrick's greatest, is in every sense of the word epic. Before anything else let me say the cinematography was amazing with every frame. As most know, this movie revolutionized space travel in film, the dawn of amazingly detailed miniatures and sets that set the standard for science fiction films to this day. The shots are not brief and to some drawn out. However, it was done for the main purpose of admiring the beauty and wonder of technology, specifically the advent of exploratory astronomy. It's a very intriguing concept and one Kubrick handles without giving into the clichÃ©d tendencies of fast-paced sci-fi/action flicks of today. Especially ones such as myself that love the genre and when watching such films sometimes wish fascinated audience members could gawk at an enormous space craft only a moment longer.Along with that, the beauty and dazzle the future promises, there's a dark underlying theme of the threat of technological advancement. You can see it from the start with the apes and the striking power that simple primitive tool brings. HAL only compounds this. The film in itself is rather abstract in a sense that it takes quite a bit of analyzing to grasp any sense of it. My understanding of it is that of a Nietzsche allegory, more specifically the concept of Apollonian and Dionysian in society. In the film, we see society as it began, with the apes as a mostly Dionysian society filled with chaos and a animal-like sense of simplicity. It's the origin point of man, which to me has always been a point of Kubrick's films. To display to audiences that despite mankind's advancements man is still just another animal with the same savage instincts as beasts, just cluttered and disguised by morality which is still just a concept dreamed up by philosophers. Calling it nihilist or not, so be it, it is a simple embrace of logic. Mankind strives ever so hard to achieve the Apollonian society, one of pure enlightenment and rational thought fueled by advancement in science. In the world set up by Kubrick, mankind has achieved this state of being and have become chillingly machine-like. The vast mystery of space is something that is not marveled at as we see a character sleeping in a bored fashion as he rides on a space shuttle and later another character sees a happy birthday wish from his family and has an almost stoic reaction. It's implied that neither have seen an actual human being in the flesh for quite a bit of time and yet their focus is entirely on their mission.HAL is the threat of a purely Apollonian society manifested. He suffers the human tendency to make an error though, and this is perhaps due to the fact that his flawless logic has become humanized by human emotion: fear and paranoia such. Dave achieves something in the end, to me a simple form of life that is in essence pure and possibly neither Apollonian or Dionysian, via the monolith. There's quite a bit of room for interpretation in this grand and certainly strange movie. It's use of music is seldom but beautiful and chilling to hear. The moments of silence seem to have even more profound reaction. A must see by all means.",10,1,3,4 June 2011
Toy Story," my Personal Favorite of Pixar's Work
","I remember seeing this film at the ripe age of seven, and I was totally entranced by it. What kid would not have been attracted to that sweet of a premise? Released way back in 1999, it was totally different from the usual hand drawn animation, and yet still as vibrant, if not more so. Even now as an 18 year old dude I find it so amazing. Attention to detail has always been Lasseter's strong suit, among many I might add. But the greatest thing about this film was the life evoked into its unique and untouchable characters.With the voice talents of Tim Allen, Tom Hanks, as well as the hilarious Don Rickles, and the late Jim Varney, the voice acting was perfect and the dialogue was surprisingly intelligent throughout. What could be perceived more or less as a simple story is told with heart and humor, one that hasn't aged a bit since that first viewing. I still own my original VHS copy in fact, but perhaps it's time I buy it on Blu-ray or DVD.",10,4,4,13 December 2010
Taken," Not too Shabby, Not Too Shabby At AllÂ….
","In the long line of espionage/rouge-agents genre, you have varying qualities. Arguably one of the greatest may be the Bourne trilogies, which are in themselves films of very good caliber. Then you have the opposite end of the spectrum, such as the clichÃ© crapfest that was 'Salt'. 'Taken' manages to stand quite nicely amongst these films, above all else due to the presence of Liam Neeson. He plays a role we are familiar with, but Neeson never lets his audience down. His acting keeps the emotional aspect of the film intact, and fine I suppose Famke Janssen as well. I also highly enjoyed Oliver Rabourdin in the film. The movie's obvious focus is action, and it does this superbly. There are many well choreographed fight scenes and believe it or not they stay well within the walls of realism for the most part. The plot has a nice pace to it, and the uglier side of reality is seen throughout the film as it displays the gruesome nightmare of the sex slave industry.I recommend the extended version for more ass-kicking, and definitely catch this one.",9,2,2,22 February 2012
The Mummy Returns," All in All a Decent Sequel
","Two years later and here comes the sequel. So who's ready for even more thrills?? Stephen Sommers once again directs and fans of the first will be pleased. This film seems less horror-like, less dark, and so I don't think it can surpass the first but don't get me wrong it's far from being a dud of a sequel. John Hannah is back!! In fact, all of the actors from the previous film return, much to my delight, although are there a few new characters of course. For one there's a kid in this film, something that worried me a bit at first in the trailers. But he doesn't distract audiences from the really important characters, and so I can live with his existence. Also, the sexy Patricia Vasquez plays a much larger role in this film as Imhotep's re-incarnated girlfriend. The story is a bit longer-feeling but it keeps you interested, the important part.Now, the SFX are outrageously well executed for the most part, but a few things were a tad bit questionable. First off, I love the end battle. It's dramatic, sad, and definitely Sommers-material. But the close-ups of The Rock as the Scorpion King were a bit too, well odd looking. His body didn't seem to blend well if you ask me. Another scene was Imhotep's suicide scene, which is tragic but is almost ruined by the look of this crevice of lost souls or whatever you want to call it. It looked rather unconvincing unfortunately. Pushing those aside, the Anubis army was quite simply stunning.This time around, Alan Silvestri does the score and he does a good enough job, though I find it would've been better if Jerry Goldsmith had returned instead. But all in all, it is a decent sequel, serving its place as an adventure/action thriller.",7,2,3,23 March 2010
Avatar," Not Cameron's best But Good
","I strangely have not reviewed it until now. Largely due to the fact that I was awaiting the fully extended edition. It really allows you to fully immerse yourself in the world of Pandora, and the character of Sam Worthington as well. The screenplay is obviously an re-used one that people are more than familiar with, alas 'Dances With Wolves' or Disney's 'Pocahontas', etc, etc. For that, I cannot say it surpassed 'T2' or 'Aliens'. This film plays on our emotions just in the way Kevin Costner and that fictional Disney romance did, just on a more elaborate scale drenched in sci-fi to disguise it. While pretty damn obvious, and so for that I can not award this film ten stars, it is pretty entertaining.The alien world is well put together with dazzling sights. The environments are astonishingly real and the way it was masterfully shot made you feel as though you were there amidst the terrifying yet intriguing fictional world. Each bizarre animal is incredibly vivid and it is rare to find creatures in a film that are so amazing. The cast was incredible and were built up quite nicely. Zoe Saldana was great, and you know I loved Sigourney Weaver throughout. Michelle Rodriguez was pretty good herself but the performance I adored the most was Stephen Lang's. He was brutal and the best shot in the whole film had to be that epic jump out of the exploding air-battle ship. What a bad-ass!! I don't know if it's just me but I do know I'm the type of viewer who connects with antagonist so for me it was kind of sad to watch him die. The score was rather good, by the master James Horner, but I found it lacking here and there. That main theme you hear as their precious tree burns is okay, but it's not quite the saddest theme I've ever heard. From time to time, it borrows a bit from 'Aliens' as well, but overall it hold together.All in all, it's a must see, and try to see the complete extended cut which has almost 20 minutes of extra footage.",7,2,6,22 November 2010
Toy Story 2," Instant Success!!
","I've never seen a more gratifying Disney sequel. Unlike the overall majority of Disney straight-to-DVD sequels, this is an actually good movie. For one thing, the whole cast has returned, Tom Hanks (<3) voicing good ole Woody, and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear.John Lasseter returns to direct and because of this kids and adults alike are in for a treat. Randy Newman scores this one and he does a bang-up job. To everyone's delight, the whole set of characters returns. Of course there are a few new characters. Among them is my new favorite, Bull's Eye. So much emotion for so few words. The story is well put together and is more than enough to compete with the original.As viewers already knew, a dilemma is produced when Woody is stolen, and a hilarious rescue mission ensues. But the screenplay doesn't let down and it turns out returning home will be more of a question of faith and loyalty than rejoice. The characters are incredibly drawn out once again and by the credits you will feel like you just watched the perfect film in a way. The jokes are ones both children and adults will enjoy, all while being quite involving. A rather dramatic sequel that only compounds the fact that 'Toy Story 2' is an instant success!!",10,1,3,12 June 2010
Saw," A So-So Film
","D+ The first film in a long line of films to disappoint me. Some go as far as to call this film a thriller, while still at the same time managing to be a good ole' horror movie. Yeah? Hardly, to be honest. But I guess the very first one is something a little different from what you might see in the average horror film. Why, because our main antagonists sets up these traps, while the victims basically mutilate themselves. Exciting and dramatic right? And with a drab score, which it probably would've done better without, so-so acting and sub-par cinematography, it's just your average horror flick to watch on a Saturday rainy day.And just when you think you're watching something a little different, with it's surprising 'twist', it lowers itself. Grade A stupid horror movie logic, especially in the case of this film trying so hard to prove that it's not. How does a doctor somehow not realize an dead man is actually not dead over a period of eight hours? Why do these helpless, desperate, and obviously horrified victims never pull the trigger on their targets? ECPECIALLY if you got the shot gun, need I say more? Just as with Tootsie Pops, the world will never know the answersÂ….",6,3,4,8 November 2010
Super 8," A Soon to be Classic
","'Super 8', directed by J.J. Abrams, the man at the head of such projects as the recent 'Star Trek'. Anyone who saw the trailer for this film were drawn by the mysterious tone of it, giving off the appearance of the next E.T. What a coincidence, guess who produced it? Speaking of which, that's probably the best way to describe it; a combination of 'The Goonies' and 'E.T.', with hints of that other movie Abrams was behindÂ…'Cloverfield'. I am no fan of thatÂ…okay movie, but don't worry this one is not shot in that annoying 'found bullsh*t footage' manner. It's just that I suppose the premise is somewhat similar.The joy of it all is the acting is quite well done. Joel Courtney, Elle Fanning, and Riley Griffiths all do incredible jobs cementing the characters in our hearts. Kyle Chandler is also great, as well as Bruce Greenwood. I don't want to reveal too much about the story, seeing as that's the key to enjoying this particular movie. In terms of drama, comedy and action, as well as mystique, I believe they hit a really good balance and the film has a vintage sheen to it. I would definitely rate this film an A.",9,0,2,10 July 2012
A Clockwork Orange," 'A bit of the old ultraviolence'
","Being born in 1992, and honestly having a bit of a 'sheltered life' at a young age, I have only recently began to immerse myself into the world of film. I have seen many a movie over the years, I must say among my all time favorites have always been the 1954 original uncut 'Gojira', 'BladeRunner', 'Schindler's List', 'Platoon', 'Pan's Labyrinth, 'The Dark Knight', among others, but when I saw this particular film it was one of the rare that a strange profound reaction occurred. For a few minutes after seeing it, I was simply stunned, having no real idea of what to make of what I just saw. I had to view the DVD again, and then it all sunk in. And now, after many a views later, it ranks among my personal top 20.Stanley Kubrick really achieved something here, something visionary and honestly hard to look at if you're really conservative or squeamish. Upon first viewing I watched it with my brother. The second time I watched it alone, but was nonetheless exhilarated. He creates what is supposed to be the future and a very unique and unparalleled vision of it. Yet it hauntingly doesn't look to different from our own, even today over 40 years since the film was released. Viewers are thrown in the midst of this world to meet the intriguing character of Alex DeLarge, played brilliantly by Malcolm McDowell. In a very graphic but all too real sense, Alex is ourselves, or friends, our enemies, the inner part of us that may be deemed wicked or unholy but undeniably human. There is a however a choice to be made, whether good or bad is entirely up to you alone. I suppose that very idea, admitting such a thing about one's self or humanity in general for that matter could turn someone off from this film. But it's really undeniable, 'A Clockwork Orange' is not a metaphor of our world; it's as if Kubrick merely put up a mirror to reflect our own decadent society.The pivotal point of this film is how pointless and rather how further degenerative it can really be to try and change human nature. And, as it is explored in this film, even if someone could manage to change it, is this man really even a man at all anymore? And before leaving you readers, I must write about one of the most mind-boggling parts of the whole the film to me, where Alex's view on the oh so precious Bible is shown, further insight to put an end to people diluting themselves. Not even a sacred book can change human nature, as Kubrick ingeniously shows.",10,5,7,3 January 2011
Stalingrad," 'The Best Thing About Cold IsÂ…' A+
","To truly appreciate this movie, you must understand director Sergio Leone's quote regarding his film 'The God, The Bad, and the Ugly' (1966):'I had read somewhere that 120,000 people died in Southern camps such as Andersonville. I was not ignorant of the fact that there were camps in the North. You always get to hear about the shameful behavior of the losers, never the winners.' I rank this one among the best war films I have ever seen. It details the horrific events of history's ugliest battle from its bloodiest war. The battle for Stalingrad left one million dead, and this brilliant movie shows it all from the point of view of the German Sixth Army. If you know history then you're aware of the fact that this loss for Germany was the first major blunder that would result in the ultimate downfall of the Third Reich. Fresh from their previous victories, the members of the Sixth Army believe they are in for a relatively easy win. However, as the fighting grows more turbulent, the city quickly becomes a hell populated by the piles of the dead. Of course, the suffering doesn't really commence till the Russian winter sets in.Showing this gruesome conflict from the German point-of-view has many purposes. Firstly, to show just how quickly the tide of a military campaign can shift, even for a superpower. Secondly, it is easy for people of the modern era to forget the suffering on both sides. Soldiers have since the beginning of time been nothing more than the tools of politicians (regardless of the government) to cement their goals. The themes are quite relevant, and the story of these men a sheer tragedy. The production value is just stunning and you really are transported back to that time of old, the battle ruined streets of that city. And the score by Norbert JÃ¼rgen, Schneider and Martin Grassl is pretty awesome, ranging from bombastic to moments of brutal melancholy. It's definitely one of my favorite war film compositions.Do not miss out on 'Stalingrad'.",10,2,4,10 July 2012
The Fly," David Cronenberg Horror Masterpiece
","One of the few and great I never tire of. I find this movie quite flawless, and for a number of reasons. First off, it took a classic from (I've seen both the Vincent Price original and its sequel) and refurbished it for another time. I still love the originals, but the remake is different enough to truly stand on its own. Secondly, casting was first rate. Geena Davis IS awesome and yes even the at-times pure douche John Getz is just great. And Jeff Goldblum, I can hardly muster the words. Behind the make-up and off, every time I feel for his character. The story has the feel of a great tragedy, telling the tale of what could've been.The special effects are quite remarkable and remain to this day unchallenged if you ask me. No amount of CGI can beat the amount of effort put into that make-up, the animatronics, or the wall-crawling scenes. Owning the DVD, I pop this in every now and then and the sight of 'Brundle Fly 'still evokes quite a bit of fear in me. And topping it all off is Howard Shore's incredible score. More and more I'm seeing how awesome of a compose he is. Check this one out!!",10,0,1,23 May 2012
Reservoir Dogs," My Favorite Tarantino Production???
","There are so many perspectives on which to praise 'Reservoir Dogs'. First and foremost, it has the edgy realism that began to slip away in the 'Kill Bill' films (which I still very much praise and enjoy), and was completely discarded in his recent film 'Inglourious Basterds'. It's like recently Tarantino let his fame go to his head and just went all out without thinking about if what he showed on screen made any real sense. This film of his, basically his first three, are the ones I admire the most. Not to mention the way the story is told, it's just very intriguing from the start. We see only brief glimpses of what actually happened at this bank job that apparently went very, very, bad. The cast was phenomenal throughout and this film had the chemistry to really make the tension play out realistically and brutally later on. The atmosphere is solid and full of well acted malice and is pretty unpredictable. In fact, amidst all the insane and gruesome scenes which some may struggle to sit through ('Can you hear me now?')is a very nicely paced plot that in reality is probably one of the greatest crime/thriller pieces ever written.The talent here is undeniable, and every performance is just awesome. The ones I really admired the most were that of Harvey Keitel as Mr. White, and definitely Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink. And where as I believe every individual character stood out quite well, the two that stirred up the most in me was Tim Roth as the nefarious Mr. Orange, but over all Michael Madsen as the sadistic Mr. Blonde. I will never forget Madsen as the soda sipping psychopath. Tarantino does well himself I must admit, and kudos to the often over-looked performance of Kirk Baltz as the unfortunate Officer Marvin Nash.With its tremendously talented cast breathing life into these characters we know so little about, coupled with its very involving story and well placed music, it all comes together as arguably Tarantino's most refined work.",10,2,4,31 January 2011
How to Train Your Dragon," Unexpectedly Remarkable
","A rather impressive film if I do say so myself. This is truly a film meant to satisfy both children and adults. The story is great, based on a children's book I believe. Well done DreamWorks, bringing this one to life. I didn't see it in 3D, finding it distracting and unnecessary. Seeing a movie in 3D, after all, wouldn't change my opinion on if it was a good or bad film. As usual, the animation is delivered is beautiful, no surprise there. What really makes the film stand out is a well constructed plot. It delivers humor both kids and their parents will enjoy. The plot has a sense of seriousness that it carries with it, just consider the climax.And the voice cast couldn't be better, with Gerald Butler, Amerrica Ferrera, Jay Baruchel, and Craig Ferguson. In addition to them, there's Jonah Hill and Chris Mintz-Plasse! So obviously enough the talent is there and well used with great dialogue. Add some great looking dragons and magnificent shots and what you get is an unexpectedly rich DreamWorks film.",10,2,4,1 November 2010
The Descent," A Rarity in Modern Horror
","A+ This one is a contemporary horror treat, and that's a rarity these days. I'd begun to lose faith in the genre as the new millennium began but this movie proves there's still quite a bit of hope. The tight-framing in those incredibly narrow caves is bound to kick-start the claustrophobia in anyone, and that's before our pale friends even come in. When they do, I'm glad to say its good old make-up and well-done lighting being used to create a very real terror. But don't go expecting your usual helpless damsels in distress, no; the nicely done screenplay has some intriguing fates not just for the characters; as well as the creatures. Every frame you find yourself on the edge of your seat, really well done. And the score by David Julyan really seals the deal.One thing I must mention though is that in horror, especially new horror, there is always the random idiot who sneaks up on a friend who is in the middle of a killing spree and makes the fatal mistake of tapping them on the soldier without warning. This is always DISTRATOUS.",10,2,5,4 January 2012
Pulp Fiction," One of My Top 15!!
","Grade: A +Is it a redemption story? If so, of human nature, or the characters themselves? A simple buddy film where action and comedy is spliced together? HELL NO!! This film has a left mark ever since I saw it. It was so different, so humorous, and yet so moving. All of this in one genre that is in itself truly hard to define.Tarantino has truly written a masterpiece. This film in reality tells three stories, which one such as myself, upon first viewing, found confusing. What can I say; it was my first Tarantino film! But after watching it several times, as I have also done, it really starts to hit you. Simply said, it really is a redemption story. Our characters are hit men, drug dealers and proud users and crime bosses. They make a living off killing and sin. So, in essence they are the 'bad guys'. And yet the audience is drawn to them due to the comedy they use. The dialogue is so rich and original we get to see two hit men talk freely about foot massages right before busting a mission, and yet it isn't regarded as silly. What other film can do that; none!In fact, it is these moments that give 'Pulp Fiction' that flame. Perhaps the best example of this savior of the human soul theme is Samuel L. Jackson's character, Jules. His performance is probably the most vivid in the movie. Every line he utters is a testament to what Tarantino envisioned. The human soul is a vile corrupt thing, but it can be reformed. It can be saved. But one has to be willing to make that change. Many times it takes a miracle for us to realize that and to make a change. It can even be our destiny to save the souls of others, as the final scene depicts with Pumpkin (Tim Roth) and Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer). There are cruel consequences that fate can play against those who refuse their destiny, as the tragic case with Vincent's death.The cast is spectacular. John Travolta and Uma Thurman (Mia) have a genius yet troubled 'love-story', twisted with temptation. Christopher Walken appears as Captain Koons and Ving Rhames as Marsellus Wallace. My favorite actor besides Samuel L. Jackson has got to be Harvey Keitel, who is known only as the Wolf. Every actor brings a different emotion to the film, really spicing it up and making it a varied film.One of my personal Top 15 films ever, 'Pulp Fiction' is widely entertain and will invoke the curiosity of movie goers for years to come.",10,8,17,3 June 2010
Titanic," Good, YesÂ…The BestÂ…Nah
","C+ The best grossing film of all time, until recently that is, but is it really the best film ever? Even worthy of getting all that money? Upon initial viewing, many probably thought so, but I'm not one of those. It does have its strong suits, and James Cameron has rarely, if ever, failed me. This film stands out as quite different in tone contrast to say 'Aliens', 'T2', or even 'Avatar'. Note the first two, f*CK Avatar, use low-key lighting, while this film is just so bright all the time. The performances are grade A in this film. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are great throughout , and the end sequence was of course astonishing and a leap forward in visual effects.My biggest problem with this movie? It over does a love story to the point it hits two hours or so, and then we get an hour more or less of epic disaster with tragedy and believable chaos. But the first two hours just seem to drag on, quite unnecessarily at that. Along with that, the score was dismal at best. Naturally the only scene to defy this was the 'last song' instant as it sank. One of the main things that draws me to a film it its score, or sometimes a lack there of. Sappy romantic themes and an unfitting climax music as thousands drown. It just was distracting and honestly didn't belong there. Overall, 'Titanic' is worth seeing and all, but far from being the best movie ever, or even close for that matter. This a movie where I definitely rent the DVD, practically fall sleep an hour or so in, then wake up and say 'what the? Still not yet?', and then just use chapter selection to get to see the climax.",7,8,14,22 November 2010
Thor," A Let Down of A Marvel Flick
","D+ I'm not much of a Thor fan to begin with, but I was not against the project and was rather intrigued by it. The casting choices seemed very spot on, myself being particularly excited by the presence of Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman. Kudos to Idris Elba as well. However, the film opens with the annoying character played by Kat Dennings. Not only that but Portman's character was one I was completely unable to connect with. Then we go to Asgard and the visuals as expected are stunning. The lighting and wide range of colors was well done and all around beautiful. The mythology was very engaging and the choice of Tom Hiddleston as Loki was a damn good one. The elite 'Warriors Three' look great from a distance but do little to nothing in the movie. There is not a single reason for me to go into them what so ever due to their lack of screen time and the fact that the majority of the time they were on screen the director treated them as over-redundant comic relief. The Ice Giants were very imposing and served well as antagonists. The battle with them was one of the film's few saving graces.Then Thor is banished to our realm, Earth, and so begins the painful midsection of the film. And this I mind you is the longest section of the movie. The dialogue is corny and the script struggles to find any bit of memorable dialogue and character development. For the longest time I forgot I was watching a superhero flick and instead a badly staged comedy/sitcom. The director refused to take the material seriously at all, even as far as having S.H.I.E.L.D. agents poke fun at the Asgardian warriors as they stroll down the street and then smother the window of a restaurant like lost dogs. And the vast majority of the humor wasn't funny sadly. This wasn't 'Iron Man' with its smart and quippy dialogue, this was so clichÃ© it hurt to watch. Denning's character comment s on how hot Thor is, a predictable and very corny romance starts that just grated on my nerves throughout. None of the protagonists seem to take their roles seriously, which would be okay if this were a straight comedy. The villains are menacing enough but don't get enough screen time. I know I keep comparing it to the Iron Man films, but the way the comedy and action are spliced together only shows how badly director Kenneth Branagh tried to make a sh*t-stained copy of those films. I found myself yawning more than anything.Destroyer was awesome in my opinion, making even further jokes out of the 'Warriors three' without a fight at all. By the time Thor gets his hammer back I was beyond bored, and in usual Marvel fashion the writers try to throw a curve ball concerning the main villain and it's a decent one I'll admit but the end battle is too short to be breath-taking. In short there are a few colorful shots and nice monsters, but this is outweighed by corny dialogue, cheesy humor and story development that redefine boredom. I cannot recommend this my fellow fans.",5,11,21,11 May 2011
Zombieland," 'It's not the taste; it's the consistency.'
","'Zombieland' is one of the best horror comedies out there. The cast is what makes it an awesome movie. Jesse Eisenburg plays the Michael Cera-niche everyone's accustom to, but the writing makes the character a lot more sympathetic. Michael Cera, to no offense as I enjoy most of his films, usually just comes off as pathetic and inhumanly good-natured. Woody Harrelson is the film definition of a bad-ass. His love for Twinkies is shared by me and the story makes him a lovable gun-toting hero. Emma Stone is pretty solid and Abigail Breslin is a talented child actor. There's nothing more annoying in a movie then a kid who either comes off as bratty or just bad at acting. She thankfully is neither.The story is a brisk one that moves quickly and while sticking to a technically predictable storyline, there are enough surprises in the writing to make it an enjoyable movie. The final battle music by David Sardy is epic and there's enough gore to satisfy me. I'm not quite sure if it's a horror classic but it is definitely a movie I recommend.",9,1,3,19 September 2011
Die Hard," I honestly don't see what the big deal is.
","D+ How this movie snaked its way up to the IMDb Top 250 is beyond me, especially when the likes of 'Gojira' (Inshiro Honda, 1954) and 'Jurassic Park' (Steven Spielberg, 1993) are not even on the list. I mean come on! Perhaps it's because it was the first of its kind; a gun-ho action movie where a singular protagonists lays the smack down on many a bad guy. I don't really have much to say about the film itself, other than nice explosions and nice guns. Whether or not it continued the tradition of the standard action flick, which is debatable, that's all I can really say about this movie: standard.Standard characters, standard storyline, and standard comic-relief. The action is fine and dandy but I guess I'm a film lover who expects more out of a movie. What's to stop me from comparing this movie to the likes of 'Commando'? Not much really, what's the difference in all honesty.",7,2,6,23 January 2012
Psycho," 'We all go a little mad sometimes.'
","Even amongst classic film legends such as Vertigo (1958) and The Birds (1963), arguably Alfred Hitchcock's most famous movie is Psycho (1960). Considered a horror icon, it excels in both cinematic tension as well as sheer terror. It accomplishes this through a variety of techniques, such as composer Bernard Herrmann's chilling score, or the ominous low-key lighting of John L. Russell's cinematography. Consider in itself the mise en scene of the creepy Bates Motel itself. But an important factor that some might overlook would be the editing, done by George Tomasini. Tomasini often worked with Hitchcock, this film being one of his major highlights. Though often subtle, but its presence can be detected throughout the film.The editing in Psycho creates its mood and aids in revealing plot details. Without it, the film would not be what it is. We would be thrown off with Marion's ambitions, and certainly the bizarre and frightening nature of Norman would also be off key. Let alone that, the story itself would be lost in terms of interpretation of time. Each aspect of a film plays an irreducible role, and the same goes for editing.",10,0,0,14 November 2011

","After not too long of a wait, Transformers 2 has finally arrived. If you were expecting the flawed yet lovable first film then too bad, so sad. If you were expecting a live-action version of the show with pure giants robots fighting each other then you're in luck. This film simply isn't on par with its predecessor. The action and SFX are obviously beyond superb, but what film's aren't these days? Micheal Bay seriously needs to stop thinking non stop action and crude humor will make a sensational movie. He simply failed here. The story feels like kind of a jumbled mess if you ask me, but it gets the job done I guess. Bay just tries to really over do the film really. Somehow big explosions and cool sound effects are going to make this film out do the first but I'm not buying it. Megan Fox on top of a motor cycle in tiny booty shorts, 'special brownies', dogs and decepticons humping multiple objects and plenty of foul language are just a few of examples of how our director tries to keep our interest during this nearly 3-hour film. Shia LaBeouf can definitely act, as he's proved before in multiple films, but he really down rates him self here.The dialouge between Sam and his girl friend is so painfully corny at times one can barely stand to watch. Still, the humor undeniably saves the film and adds what it does to it. It does however subtract from the screen time for our new autobots who indeed looked incredibly bad ass. All they do is shoot and get shot, unlike in the first film where we actually had time to get to know each autobot. Except for the 'twin' robots who were actually getting annoying by the end of the film. The decepticons aren't characterized very well honestly and all too often are portrayed as mindless monsters. Luckily Star Scream returns but the battles are so chaotic, one can hardly tell the bad guys apart.",5,9,15,18 July 2009
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," 'I want my cigarettes!'
","A good old classic from the 70s, definitely unforgettable. Two great forces propel this movie, Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher. Their antics are as hilarious as they are dramatic. I'll always love Nicholson as the care-free Randle McMurphy who's indomitable spirit lifts the perpetual inmates of the mental institution to rebellion. Nurse Ratchet, one of those few great villainesses in cinema. Her icy demeanor really sold the brutality of the character. And Will Sampson, how can anyone forget him as Chief? Danny Devito, boy, I hardly recognized him upon first viewing, and he too was pretty awesome. Brad Dourif was eternally great, and Christopher Lloyd also stars. There are just so many great actors here and every performance is so natural you become very connected with the characters.Topping this collection of great performers like icing on a cake is a great story based on Ken Kesey's 1962 novel of the same name. Jack Nitzsche also serves up a subtle yet unforgettable score, got to love his work. If you haven't seen this classic, you're missing out one of Hollywood's best.",10,2,4,23 May 2012
Downfall," 'You must be on stage when the curtain falls.' A+
","One of those rare movies that takes us into the Third Reich, this film focusing on its final days. A German production from the actors to the composing, this film holds back nothing and shows the events just as they unfolded. As an avid watcher of documentaries, I've actually compared the archive footage and film print, and to be honest at times the only difference of course is the clarity. Watching it all, I got the strange feeling that this was what the end of humanity would like: Optimists never truly giving in, a rain of fire from the sky, and the broken down idealists finally accepting their fate. The portrayal of Hitler here is just that; a broken man losing control. I wouldn't go so far as to call the film sympathetic to the Fuehrer, but it does portray him as a defeated visionary. Bruno Ganz played the man with sheer excellence.Also, the film shows what the desperation of war brings out in people. Even with the German defeat immanent blood runs through the streets of Berlin like a river. It's a gruesome reality that at times feels like a nightmare. The acting is Grade A material and you can feel how each person is feeling as their world crumbles around them. The film neither praises nor condemns what is seen on screen; the events simply unfold. It is in itself but a documentary of sorts, showcasing the ultimate downfall.'If the idea of National Socialism dies, then there is no future.'",10,0,1,27 June 2012
Army of Darkness," 3rd Installment Kicks Ass!!
","A+ I now own all three Evil Dead movies, and this film is must see by me. Released in 1992, this film still hits incredibly hard on several aspects, including cinematography, comedic elements, and an imaginative and original story as well as adventurous action. Sam Raimi even delivers a good many scares and a few grisly shots, but maybe not enough gore for some fans' taste. Still, Bruce Campbell returns so all is forgiven in my book. I'll say right now that I wholeheartedly prefer the Director's cut, and especially the alternate (original) ending. More material, more fun to put in short.The cast is pretty decent, as is the story which moves briskly and never drags. Not only that, it was incredibly funny through I must say; Ash delivers his dialogue crisply, and as a plus, Raimi relies on mostly raw effects, including good old stop motion. This fits the film perfectly as I've quickly grown tired of CGI with each film now-a-days, especially in the horror genre where I've always felt CGI did not belong. The end battle is priceless, with the wise-cracking army of the undead led by Evil Ash himself, awesome! The sets are great, the shots are intense and always a pleasure. And the icing on the cake, Joseph Do Luca returns a final time for the marvelous score and this is classic amongst garbage.",9,4,6,3 January 2011
Jaws," 'Cage goes in the water. You go in the water. Sharks in the water, our shark.' A+
","Dare I call it Spielberg's greatest film ever? I'm sure I wouldn't be alone in such an assessment. Many say this film, along with George Lucas' Star Wars, was among the movies to really set in motion the summer movie movement. You know, rampant marketing, familiar characters and stories, ridiculously huge box office draws. However, there is one thing that sets this film apart from most contemporary duds: character. The characters here feel so real to one that you feel you know them. Roy Scheider (Brody) is just fantastic, Lorraine Gary is also pretty good and Richard Dreyfuss is pretty awesome. Who can forget Robert Shaw's (as Quint) entrance with the nails on the chalk board? These characters have been so ingrained in our psyche that we often do not even realize when modern films and TV shows pay tribute to them.It's also Spielberg's greatest attempt at horror. Though he's had some relatively close ones like 2005's 'War of the Worlds', it still doesn't compare to his work in this one. And duh, John William's score is just BAD-ASS. That theme is probably one of the composer's most iconic themes ever, but there also many quiet moments that create splendid tension. And our friend the Great White, surely one of Hollywood's greatest movie monsters most definitely.An unbeatable classic.",10,2,6,10 July 2012
Hancock," One of Will Smith's Best
","I finally saw 'Hancock'. I've got to say this is definitely one of Will Smith's best films, which took the idea of superheroes into a completely new direction. This new direction was fresh, unique and undeniably funny and even mysterious at times. Also starring the enticing Charlize Theron, the odd love story is a blast with kick-ass action. The humor is one of the film's principle elements that, with superb Will Smith, really makes the audience connect with Hancock, despite his relatable foul mouth and drinking problems. Not to mention the movie is sad and actually touching and I already can't wait for the sequel. Some complain it's too convoluted and the language is too obscene for a superhero movie but don't be an 'asshole' and just enjoy it for what it is. You parents criticizing 'Hancock' for the language, the MPPA creates ratings for a reason. Simply just don't take the firkin' eight year olds. Let 'em see 'Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer', the God-awful piece of crap. Besides, editing the movie anymore would've killed it. If you feel 95 minutes is too short of a run time for a hero flick, as I did, definitely check out the unrated version of 'Hancock'. More laughs, more character development and all together what should've been released in theaters. Minus the sex scene. Funny yes, but a tad much. The only other flaw is the lack of a real villain.",8,4,7,9 April 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Best of the Series!!
","After the much better Episode II, I simply could not wait to see Episode III. Episode III is undoubtedly one of the best Star Wars films ever made, if not comparable to the very first film in fact. The film exceeded my expectations to be honest. I'm well aware there are some die-hard Star Wars fans out there reading this review who will say Episode III was just as horrible as the first two prequels. However, the critics all agree, 'Revenge of the Sith' is actually a VERY good film. All the performances were top-rate, Hayden Christensen diving even deeper into Anakin's darkness. The character is portrayed perfectly here and Hayden delivers all the emotions that are need to complete this character. To truly get me on its greatness, let's go through this film shall we....The opening scene is the BEST space battle ever!! All the spacecraft look excellent and this sequence is thrilling to say the least. Aboard the Separatist battle cruiser, Count Dooku fights a excellent battle against Kenobi and Skywalker, ending with Dooku being gruesomely decapitated. We also meet my favorite villain ever, General Grievous. Lucas did great here, using the cyborg alien as a foreshadowing of what will happen to Anakin later. Anyways, the Chancellor is rescued and the battle is won. While on Corusant, we learn Padme is now pregnant, which causes the real trouble to begin. To make things worse, he has a vision that she will die in child birth, furthering his emotional turmoil. Meanwhile, the Jedi Council senses the Chancellor is up to something, and have Anakin investigate. This brilliant part of the screenplay forces Anakin to ponder his trust of the Jedi and Obi-Wan himself. Ian McDiarmid is excellent as Palpatine and his performance is captivating. It was just how I imagined Anakin would fall and the temptation of the Dark Side is wonderful. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) goes to the beautiful sinkhole planet of Utapa to take out Grievous leading to one of my favorite fight scenes ever. The whole having four-arms thing was a dope idea but it was a little short in my opinion. Of course, though, he can't take up to much screen time but the music by John Williams was spectacular, giving Grievous a sort of theme that sounded, well, dope (Especially as he arrived on Utapa). On Corusant, Anakin informs Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) about how Palpatine is actually Darth Sidious and the Council moves quickly to arrest him but he easily kills nearly all of them. All except Mace Windu, who fights a terrific battle , seemingly winning. However, Anakin intervenes and wounds Windu, and the dark lord kills him. Believing Sidious will help him find a way to save Padme, Anakin finally pledges himself to Sidious and now the story really picks up speed (you did good, Lucas, you did good). Order 66 is given and one of the film's best sequences take place. All around the universe, in mid-battle, clones turn on their Jedi commanders and kill them. The moment is a tragedy in itself, and the score here is one of John William's best. The moment is perfect. Meanwhile, Darth Vader leads a legion of clones in an attack on the Jedi Temple. In one horrific scene, Anakin is shown getting ready to slaughter children. This is probably the darkest moment in Star Wars history. It is moments like these Lucas out does himself as the seriousness takes new heights. This tone is much better than the past two flicks, one fans and critics alike have been waiting for.Obi-Wan and Yoda manage to survive and make it back to Corusant thanks to Senator Organa. It is here they learn of Anakin's betrayal. It is also here that Palpatine becomes Emperor as the Republic is forever gone, replaced by the Empire. Darth Vader meanwhile brutally kills the Separatist, and the story all comes together as we realize how the Empire was born. Lucas doesn't let us down here and Mustufar looks fantastic. The planet is a burning hell that helps mold the atmosphere of the coming final battle. Yoda fights the Emperor and it is much better than the Yoda vs. Dooku fight in Episode II, which looked a bit ridiculous to be honest. However, the finale is on Mustufar......Padme confronts Anakin about what he's done, only to discover he's become an entirely different person. The music adds to the emotional power of this scene as Natalie Portman gives it her all, only for Anakin to strangle her, one of the film's saddest moments. Twisted by the Dark Side, he now has nearly killed the woman he loves in his anger. This anger he now focuses on Obi-Wan as the two begin to circle one another. The dialogue is great and I love how brothers are now forced to fight to the death. Nick Gillard, the sword fight coordinator, makes sure this is the best lightsaber duel ever, and I for one am not disappointed. The battle last forever, the moves are insane, fierce body blows are served up and all along they must deal with the hazards of a planet that is a giant active volcano!! It is the MOST AMAZING DUEL EVER!!!!! The piece by our acclaimed composer is the best in the film and will leave you stunned. When Obi-Wan finally mortally wounds Anakin, tears will roll as Obi-Wan mourns his gone friend. As Padme dies, Vader is reborn and audiences will feel Anakin's pain as his sole reason for taking this path he knows is now gone.Emotionally powerful, visually thrilling, with some dope action scenes, with a compelling score, 'Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith' is the best of the series in my opinion.",10,1,6,13 April 2009
The Lion King," Childhood Gem
","Is there anyone who didn't love this film? Besides the one sentence/one-star reviews that always bring a film down these days? Probably one of Disney's greatest animated films ever, easily surpassing the many before it and many after it. The story is dynamic and much more involving than alas 'Cinderella', 'Beauty and the Best', and plenty of others that I not need say. Many Disney films seem to me oh so similar in premise and characters, this one stand s out as a truly unique and very different tale. And with the voice talents of Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Whoopi Goldberg, Rowan Atkinson, plus many, many others, the characters seemed much more human to me than the repeated after repeated princess in distress who is best friends with nature as wellÂ….how dull! And to think these are merely anthropomorphic animals, how ironic. In my humble opinion, this also Matthew Broderick's best performance ever.And as if having Hans Zimmer score the film wasn't a grand achievement in itself, Elton John and Tim Rice add to the score beautifully. The end result is a tale so epic if you look at it from a glance it evokes the scope of a Greek tragedy. In fact, amongst the many over-rated Disney Renaissance era films, this is one of the few where I can watch it again and again without ever tiring of it.",10,2,2,16 December 2010
Inception," Over-hyped..yes, But No Doubt Well Made
","Christopher Nolan once again outdoes himself. As I've noted this story is eight years in the making, and it definitely shows. As always with Nolan, this screenplay is incredibly intricate and as usual he deliverers many a twists and will have audiences struggling to keep up with at times. I know I did, seeing as this movie invents its own terminology and a set of complex rues for a world we are more or less familiar with-the dream world. The shots are insane and the film honestly delivers more action than I expected. And as dazzling as it all is, the pacing isn't all that bad and keeps you involved throughout as a fresh and unique mystery film. Yes, Nolan very successfully mixes the genres here.And Hans Zimmer once more fascinates us with a brilliant score that is moving and constantly energetic. The acting, if even need be said, is outstanding. I highly enjoyed Leonardo DiCaprio as the tortured soul Cobb, and Ken Watanabe was masterful as always. Ellen Page was surprisingly good and I love that Cilian Murphy had a large role in the film because his performances are always so well done. Marion Cotillard was had an interesting role that I enjoyed second only to DiCaprio's. The characters are all portrayed rather well, if not left underdeveloped. However, that's to be expected, as the main story focuses heavily on Cobb and Mal; and the struggle of Ariadane to save him. Although I suppose Saito becomes a major factor in the climax as well. It's all very elaborate and I won't spoil for those who haven't seen it. Just beware you are in for a movie you'll really have to pay attention to. It probably will become a sci-fi classic, although when you leave don't expect to be truly mesmerized by the characters, aside the main two I mentioned earlier. Along with Murphy's excellent character sub-story of course.I can not say this film surpassed the likes of 'The Dark Knight' as some go as far as to say, but I still highly recommend it.",8,1,5,4 January 2011
Sherlock Holmes," 'Death is only the beginning.'
","A+If there is one genre I began to detest over the years, it was the 'buddy-action' flicks. You know the movies where two guys who aren't exactly friends are forced to form an uneasy alliance which leads to hilarious escapades. It's only been done a thousand and one times, note the long line of duos: Bruce Willis & Samuel L. Jackson ('Die Hard 3'), Will Smith & ('Wild Wild West'), Chris Tucker & Jackie Chan ('Rush Hour'), and let's not forget Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson ('Shanghai Knights'). Though many (but certainly not all) of the aforementioned films are indeed funny, few have any real lasting qualities and even fewer a challenging storyline. The best they can often do is throw an alluring female co-star between the two leads, but I digress.This film however, stands a monumental achievement. Firstly, the cast is really something else. Robert Downey Jr. as our titular character, and he does a bang up job playing a man who's a mystery in himself. Jude Law is entertaining and I'm glad Eddie Marsan was aboard. Mark Strong makes for a very impressive antagonist, and Rachel McAdams is a seductive femme fatale of sorts. The gloomy setting, 1800s London, couldn't be better realized and it definitely gives the film a darker tone. Most importantly though, the story is truly a one-of-a-kind detective tale. It really is a pitting of rationality vs. superstition, and to my heart-thumping exhilaration for the majority of the film you would think good old logic had been defeated. Moving on before I spoil anything. The plot twists and turns menacingly, and leaves one astounded by the effort put into the writing.Lastly, kudos to composer Hans Zimmer who did a very catchy leitmotif that fit the film perfectly. The gray-blue cinematography is great, and I've got to congratulate Guy Ritchie on his feat.",10,2,2,23 January 2012
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," A Tremendously Poignant Tale A+
","All too often the Korean War is called the 'The Forgotten War' and in a sense I suppose it's true. Ask the young ones of today and they'll most likely have the vaguest of ideas. The amount of films about this particular war as opposed to the enormous succession of Vietnam and WW II movies is staggering. This movie is by all means a must see first and foremost because it details a brutal conflict that the world hasn't truly paid tribute to. The acting is sensational and all the more I find myself South Korean cinema. It certainly feels like a high budget epic of a war film, and rightfully so.Like a true masterpiece, the film displays the sickening effects of the war on ideology on both sides. One Jang Dong-gun's character is molded by the tide of the war, becoming a mere shadow of who he once was. Won Bin is also excellent, not to mention Lee Eun-joo. The atmosphere is one displaying how turbulent the times were and how the atrocity destroyed lives. The score by Lee Dong-jun is also quite magnificent, bringing many emotions to the film. I highly recommend this movie.",10,3,3,5 July 2012
WALLÂ·E," Andrew Stanton's Best
","I saw the film and honestly believe it could easily be Disney's best. Pixar is already known for providing something different with each film, but this one goes beyond all others in its scope and tone. It works on many levels, that of a children's' film, a unique love story, as well as an sci-fi epic. Ben Burtt did wonders with the sound and yet these mostly silent characters are more involving and moving than any animated film's I've seen in along, long, time. The animation is visually stunning to say the least, and every shot is done beautifully. It's done with an artistic style that future films will struggle to even come close to.Not only that, but the film has a thinly veiled message concerning the future of our once precious Earth. The film delivers particularly clever writing, literally going well beyond what most thought could be integrated in a film aimed for children. Truly Disney's greatest achievement, although I to this day struggle over whether it overtakes my fondness of 'Toy Story' and its excellent sequels. 'Wall-E' is among the best films of all time.",10,1,2,13 December 2010
Rango," Pure Awesomeness
","This film is a masterpiece and a glorious piece of animation. Firstly, you've got to recognize the film's balls. Instead of aiming to please the general audiences with cute and cuddly creatures, the characters you see here are anything but attractive. How many times have I seen an audience wooed to praise a film because of its 'cute factor'? No such shenanigans here. Secondly, it's a gritty storyline that holds faithful to the Western tradition. Its story telling isn't sugar coated and neither is its dialogue, surely to the dismay of some parents I assume. Its distinct style is why this film is so enjoyable and truth be told it probably isn't for all ages, but these days with morals going right out the windows, is it fair to say the argument starts to become invalid? Bill Nighy, as Rattlesnake Jake, was just bad-ass, awesome presence. Johnny Depp is remarkable as our Chameleon, and many other well done voice acting is in the film. Like Alfred Molina and Isla Fisher. The score by Hans Zimmer is irresistible, sounding very much like dare I say a Spaghetti Western. You even get to hear Richard Wagner's 'Ride of the Valkyries' played briefly by the strings of a banjo. And speaking of spaghetti Westerns, I'm sure everybody thought there was a strong resemblance e to Eastwood's Man with No Name in that scene near the climax. It's just a good experience to watch this film, so please do.",10,1,1,1 February 2012
Platoon," 'When Iï»¿ die, bury me upside-down, so the world can kiss my ass'
","A+ Undoubtedly one of the best war films ever made, if not one of the THE best films of all time. Where to begin with such a film? A lot of this goes to Oliver Stone, who actually served in the God-forsaken jungles of Vietnam. The film really brings to light the atrocities and pointlessness of the Vietnam War full force, all cleverly represented by the soldiers who fought these not so courageous and valor-filled battles.The conflict is simple at a glance; Chris Taylor, played superbly by Charlie Sheen, is a young recruit who in a similar trait to the Civil War novel 'The Red Bade of Courage' is naively eager to be a proud and loyal soldier fighting against Communism, as he believes, nobly. However, he soon finds that 'the 'Nam' is nothing like he thought it would be. The Vietnam is portrayed as realistically as it will ever be here: as a chaotic, dark, and all to real nightmare. It is within this hell he realizes that there are only two ways to truly endure the war: Give into near animal instincts, discarding all morals and perspectives of decency or find ways to escape the war at least for short bursts. Taylor decides to choose the latter, but regardless the platoon is divided by these two choices, on one side being Barnes, who will let the war consume them completely. The other is Elias, who represents Taylor's last grasp to his humanity. Many choose one path and never turn away from it, despite the fact that many of these men will die regardless. The underlying conflict is how you spend those last remaining days, minutes, instances of life. And all along the Vietcong are just an outside force who the soldiers have no real chance of understanding or negotiating with , just one of the many hazards they will have to survive.Tom Berenger is endlessly great as Barnes, and Willem Dafoe is no less stunning. Every performance is stunning and captures the very real fear of war. Among the many other stand out performances in this picture are Kevin Dillon as the sadistic Bunny, John C. McGinley as Sgt. O'Neill, Francesco Quinn as Rhah, Johnny Depp as Lerner, Forest Whitaker as Big Harold and Keith David as the unforgettable King. And the coup de grace, an unforgettable and heartbreaking score by the late Georges Delerue and Samuel Barber, such beautiful and yet clearly pained music. 'Platoon' will never cease to be my favorite war flick ever.",10,35,43,4 January 2011
Prometheus," 'If you go down there, you're going to die.'
","We've long awaited this day after Cameron's 'Aliens' back in '86. I never really cared for 'Alien 3', and Resurrection is one I rather enjoyed despite its flaws. Once the AVP films came around the sh*t really hit the fan. Many, including myself, thought the series was dead and buried. However, Ridley Scott himself decided to revisit the series and not only take it back to its roots but in a sense go even further.Allow me to start with the cast; all very well chosen and great characters. Guy Pearce is pretty awesome, Idris Elba is damn good and Charlize Theron is as I expected fantastic. Noomi Rapace is excellent in her role, giving off a Ripley-style aura without going to much into it. She's still very much her own character, symbolized by her faith and ties to religion. There's some sensuality but its never overplayed and never feels out of place. Michael Fassbender is just amazing. I don't fear spoiling he's an android because it's damn obvious not but a few minutes after meeting him. He infuses a lot into his character, a mix of Rachel from Ridley Scott's 'Blade Runner' and HAL from '2001: A Space Odyssey'. His performance simply fascinates, and I leave it at that.After the over-laden crapfest of directors like Paul W.S. Anderson and the Strauss Brothers brought to the series, the effects team brings dignity and dare I say class back to the gore. The creature designs are just stunning and quite sickening. They'll amaze as much as they make your skin crawl. And this movie WILL make your skin crawl. Production value in addition reminds you of the original 1979 'Alien' with great spaceship sets as well as eerie planet environments.Best part of this movie is how the story is told. Some of it you'll recognize as trademarks of the sci-fi/horror genre, other aspects are things fanboys like myself have been dreaming about for decades but there's also quite a bit of philosophy and ideology weaved into it all. The origin of man, possible existence of a deity, our purpose in the universe, all are toyed around with in this film. Brilliant move it is, the movie will ask more questions than it answers, not only about the saga but about our race itself. I urge all to see 'Prometheus'.",8,13,24,25 July 2012
Halloween," 'Was that the boogey man?'
","The black screen begins to roll the opening credits, and all we see is a sinister jack-o-lantern. This is the beginning of what is among the best of the horror genre and an indomitable classic. It's easy for people to forget that this film was the first in the overly long line of 'teen slashers'. This film gave birth to the sub-genre audiences have become so accustomed to it's become a formula. The Friday the 13th series ran it into the ground full-steam, Jason X anybody, with over ten sequels. Still, Michael Meyers lives on in this classic. Regardless of the sequels and rip-offs, this is still one of John Carpenter's finest.Leading this off is a well-acted set of characters. Jamie Lee Curtis makes her debut quite excellently, and Donald Pleasance is simply iconic as Dr. Loomis. And no one can forget the music of John Carpenter. Most definitely the scariest piano you'll ever here. My favorite scene from this masterpiece? Probably when Annie (played by Nancy Loomis) yells,' Hey jerk, speed kills!' Somehow, despite being in complete daylight, the driver is in complete shadow and actually stops the car dead in the middle of the street. The character of Michael Meyers is one crazy guy, certainly not one I'd ever want to see outside my window.",10,0,1,10 July 2012
Despicable Me," Heart warming Fun
","I was pretty surprised by the quality of this film. As usual, the animation was stunning, but I digress. What kids' flick isn't on par with the animation now-a-days, aside maybe the few nobodys that no one ever cares for. Disney and Dreamworks are no longer the only real competition. The emotion in the film is definitely its strongest suit, for you'll probably find yourself very touched by these characters by the end of the movie. This makes up for the rather simple story actually, one you probably have seen in some cartoon show somewhere.The voice acting was pretty on spot, with Steve Carell Russel Brand, and Jason Segal. And for the record this is probably the only production starring Miranda Cosgrove that I actually respect. The only other I have to knit pick about is perhaps the score; not the most stunning I've ever heard, but it holds my attention rather well. So definitely check this film out, because it's worth it.",9,7,9,27 January 2011
Raging Bull," 'Your mother's an animal ya son of a b*tch!'
","Everyone loves holds dear the classic era of cinema; the heyday of the Western, the innocence of the screwball comedy and the mystique of film noir. While these genres have lived on in contemporary movies, the 1960s were the arrival of films with a profound boldness. Discretion was tossed to the wind and subtly was thrown to the wind. This advent of risquÃƒÂ© film making was the beginning of a new era, marked predominately by unrestricted sexuality and violence. This has continued on to this day, but certain periods were peaks in these categories. On one end of the stick is a cult horror film like The Evil Dead (Sam Raimi, 1981), which is infamous for its over-the-top gore. Other films, such as Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull (1980) struck viewers with heart pounding realistic violence. Its approach to on-screen violence, acting and cinematography all come together to make the definition of a gritty film making.The film of old used specific techniques to cement their themes and emotions, and while these varied the mood in specific genres was ever consistent. Pre-sixties horror was that of Them! (Gordon Douglas, 1954), but at the sunset of the fifties, films such as Psycho (Alfred Hitchcock, 1960) began to bend the rules. Of course, the production code which had regulated just what films could show had been done away with. This was the genesis of the new wave era.Robert De Niro plays the role of the titular character, boxing legend Jake La Motta excellently, but he took method acting to an unprecedented level. De Niro underwent vigorous physical training, much of it with Jake La Motta himself, but that was only the first course. Not just physical strain put on him; he also gained a whole sixty pounds for the post-boxing years portion of the film. Impersonation acting grew vastly from the New Wave era, where actors are not held by contract to play niche roles. It allows true versatility to take hold. The mise en scene of the film is quite ironic. Film noir was the beginning of Hollywood exposing the darker nature of what went on behind the closed doors of even the most serene family. This film itself is a period piece, and the home of La Motta is very similar to the ideal 40s and 50s suburbs. There is even a cross overlooking the couple's mattress. Despite this, the violence of the character's nature stains into every facet of his life. In that bedroom, with the religious symbol watching it all, the man deals harsh blows to his wife (played by Cathy Moriarty-Gentile). The scene is only one of many that can be hard to watch for squeamish viewers, many critics themselves initially were polarized by the amount of brutality in the film.The cinematography by Michael Chapman, and without a doubt the editing of Thelma Schnoonmaker is also a real highlight of the film. Note the fight between La Motta and Marcel Cerdan. There is rapid cross-cutting in a series of short takes to give the action a very intense feel. A Dutch angle is used to create distortion as our character takes a brief interlude before re-entering the fray. The whole scene illustrates the chaos of a single fight.",10,2,2,14 November 2011
X-Men: First Class," Not Since X2 Have I Been So Amazed
","I honestly underestimated this movie, But I can say now I was no less than stunned. And how my doubt would have been lessened all the sooner had I known Matthew Vaughn was directing. Yes, under his direction we don't get a Brett Ratner purely action driven mainstream flick, or a Gavin Hood clichÃ© fest. The amazing thing is that this is a prequel/reboot so the vast majority of the audiences have an idea of what's going to happen.The brilliant thing is the screen play still packs quite a bit of surprises into it all. The story is highly involving and best of all the characters portrayed here are interesting and the actors playing them talented. Jennifer Lawrence is a very good Mystique, and James McAvoy I knew from the start wouldn't fail me. Michael Fassbender was perfect as a young Magneto, putting so much emotion into the villain every second of his screen time astounded me. Emma Frost is given much more screen time this time around, and is a lot better portrayed by January Jones. Beast was awesome, damn it, the characters all get their moment of awesomeness. I can't possibly go over all of them in this review without dragging it on. I can only add that Kevin Bacon was quite the antagonists and ZoÃ« Isabella Kravitz was a very luscious Angel.And the score by Henry Jackman was undeniably awesome. It has a modern feeling to it yet so packed with emotion and sharpening each moment. Definitely see this one because it takes a giant sh*t on the likes of 'X-Men: The Last Stand' and ' X-Men Origins: Wolverine'.",10,6,10,4 July 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," 'I was wondering what was going to break first; your spirit, or your body.'
","Rumored and I suppose confirmed by both Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale, this is to be the final bout for the Caped Crusader. My first impression after viewing the movie is that it is indeed epic. Each movie is different and amazing in its won respect and while I still feel 2008's 'The Dark Knight' stands as the pinnacle of emotional upheaval for the trilogy, TDKR definitely takes the cake for most monumental. It'll be hard to do this review without spoilers, but I can get it done. Firstly, I'm very pleased that every cast member has decided to return for the finale. Christian Bale, Gary Oldman and Michael Caine all reprise their roles and do fantastic jobs. There are several new faces, among them Matthew Modine, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard being as sexy as she is entertaining. Ann Hathaway is a pretty good Catwoman, delivering a less sensually driven performance than Michelle Pfeiffer (don't get me wrong I still love 'Batman Returns'). Everyone knows of the terrible raping of the Bane character in Shumacer's 'Batman and Robin', reducing the iconic villain to a lumbering dimwit. Tom Hardy finally gives justice to the character on the big-screen and damn does it feel good. He has the physical presence as well as the cunning aspects from the comic book; done just excellently. They couldn't have made a better choice for the final villain honestly. And yes, there are lots of cameos, so be prepared to wet your parents.Secondly, I'll quickly go over my sole gripe, being that I wish Hans Zimmer had delivered more new compositions for the piece. This may be due to the resignation of James Newton Howard who had collaborated with Zimmer on the previous two films. Put it this way, both Catwoman and Bane receive ample treatment and have terrific themes. There are lots of quieter moments as well, but for Batman himself it's mostly recycled music which is still quite empowering just not what I expected. However, it's not a great deal to me because by the second film there already was a decent amount of recycled cues, making it pointless to dwell on.My main applause for this movie is to the incredible story. If you're an avid reader of graphic novels, like me, you'll notice the screenplay uses elements from many iconic Batman comics. 'Knightfall (1993) obviously being the story that debuted Bane, Frank Miller's 'Dark Knight Returns' (which depicted Batman going back to his work after a long hiatus) and also the 'No Man's Land' story arc. Using these, the arguable cream of the crop of the Batman universe, a great epic is told. The action is really taken to new heights and the scope of it all is astonishing. Never before and maybe never again will you see Batman pushed this hard. We truly see Gotham at its knees and to make it all the better, believe it or not, there are still quite a bit of physical effects at work here. CGI is still secondary to good old raw effects.This a great movie with some really hard-hitting action, some strong emotions and an epic vision. They even manage to sneak some very well done plot twists, making this a truly satisfying finale. May Batman's rest be a peaceful one from the big screen, even if only for a short while.",9,4,10,25 July 2012
Iron Man," Funny, Stunning Action, Great Characters...Quite Simply Extraordinary
","After 2007's rather disappointing hero flicks, mediocre 'Spider-Man 3' and the flat-out crappyness of 'Fantastic Four 2', I was hoping 2008 would be a year of improvement. With this film, one won't be disappointed. Jon Favreau was a surprising choice, the man behind 'Elf' whether you liked it or not, but he definitely proves he can handle a comic book movie with better directing than Brett Ratner or Tim Story. Compared to this movie alone, the hero films them two have directed seem like nothing more than piles of, what else, crap. One of the things I enjoy about this film is the characters, which are so easy to embrace through light-hearted and hard times. Robert Downey Jr. couldn't have done better in his role, and the cast is fantastic. The comedy entertains yet at the same time manages to strengthen the relationships between the characters throughout. Terrance Howard and Gwyneth Howard definitely act superbly, as well as Jeff Bridges. Bridges is just excellent as Obadiah Stane.The action, driven by a very good story, is kick-ass.The Iron Man suit looks remarkably real despite being CGI and is quite the accomplishment. If the scene with the terrorist doesn't thrill you, then the climactic battle with Iron Monger will leave you stunned. The score by Ramin Djawadi is something new and I love it. It fits the film perfectly.'Iron Man' is quite simply extraordinary.",10,1,2,16 May 2009
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," I figured out way back if God is all-powerful, He cannot be all good.
","Ah, the most controversial movie in ages as superhero movies go. Well, since MoS back in 2013. But whereas that film divided the critics 50-50, this film was hit hard with a 41% rating which has currently dipped to 28%. And a lot of people I have talked to about the movie have either: 1.) haven't seen because of said negative publicity or 2.) or hated for several arbitrary reasons or 3.) give it a pleasant rating anywhere from 7/10 to 10/10. So as quickly as possible I will lay out the pros and cons of this movie. Quite frankly I loved it but I can see why some people may not have liked it. Here are flaws that irked me: 1.The Knightmare scene where Batman has a nightmare and/or vision concerning Superman becoming an authoritarian ruler of Earth. This scene is great but then you see the minions of Darkseid raining down from the sky as well. Problem isÂ…audiences (unless comic book fans or even simply a fan of the 90s and early 2000s DC animated shows) have no idea what these creatures are. For a fan, seeing this is awesome. For a casual moviegoer this is probably downright confusing. Although it still begs the question as to why Darkseid's forces are linked to Superman. BUT, if you watched the animated (awesome) show from the 90s, you know it's not entirely impossible for Superman and Darkseid to have joined forces.2. Right after this already very mind-boggling scene, we are treated to what we assume is The Flash coming from either the future (or maybe another universe?) to warn Bruce about Superman, though it is a tad vague. These two scenes back-to-back were leaving a comic book nerds like me hooked and anxious for the sequel, but I will admit that they are just too much for casual audiences. Perhaps they should've been excluded from the theatrical version, which would have trimmed down the movie and maybe even pleased those who said the story was a mess in their eyes. At the same time it's great for the die-hard fans who in all honesty this film was made for. Moving away from this, the only other thing that bothered me was Jesse Eisenberg's Luthor. His introduction felt off from what I usually expect from Luthor who as far as I'm concerned has always been comedic when represented on film. That being said, as the movie went on I actually came to embrace this version of Lex. He actually encompasses every bit of the inferiority complex-having, power hungry, intellectual showboat that Lex is. He is in my opinion the most sinister version of Lex put on the big screen and he has some of the best lines in the movie. Still, at times he comes off as a bit too quirky and socially awkward but there is more good than bad here. Now to what I liked.Visually, the movie is breathtaking. Every set looks great, the look of each hero or villain is fantastic, and the cinematography is jaw-dropping. In short, the movie is gorgeous. The performance of every actor and actress in the movie was phenomenal. Ben Affleck really nailed Batman in this movie. He is definitely on par with the greats like Keaton and Bale. As for the whole 'no-killing' thing, I'm just bored to death of this trope. Half the people who gripe about heroes killing bad guys here or there need to actually pick up a comic. Not only that, for goodness' sake the only reason why this became a facet of Batman is because the original writers needed an excuse for Batman to face his enemies in future story lines. I highly appreciate the role of this rule in films like The Dark Knight where the whole point was to test Batman's resolve. However, this film is about a broken and disillusioned Batman so his morals are obviously going to be different. Besides, Batman has killed in previous films (both Nolan and Burton) it never stopped me from enjoying those movies. Cavill was great at portraying the weight on his character's shoulders. All the warnings of Costner's Kent from MoS came to fruition, and all this tension came together perfectly because of the performances and visuals. Gadot really did steal the show at times and I cannot wait to see more of her on the big screen sword in hand. Amy Adams, Diane Lane, Laurence Fishburne, Jeremy Irons, and Holly Hunter all delivered in this movie. The acting really brought his movie to life. And the score by Hans Zimmer was one of the best soundtracks I have EVER had the pleasure of listening to. This film hints at many popular DC comics story lines, but by far the most used is The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller. The themes really carry over very well and it really adds to the motives of the main characters. Yes, this movie is dark and thought-provoking, but unlike a lot of what people have been saying it has touches of humor mixed in as well. More so than MoS admittedly. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie on many levels and I believe there is something in there that every superhero or action lover can see in it. The critics have said their word, but it's really up for you as a viewer to decide for yourself. After all, the word of critics does not always hold up as I'm sure we've all seen on numerous occasions.",10,4,7,30 March 2016
Blade Runner," The Perfection Rarely Seen On-Screen
","Many ideas and theories have come from viewers after watching this movie. It came in 1982, long before I was born, a whole decade in fact. And so, I had the pleasure of viewing the 'Final Cut' of the film. Ridley Scott's greatest achievement I'll admit. A beautifully dark sci-fi spectacle that works on many levels and provokes so many thoughts you'll find several reasons to love it.I'll start with the cast, who is incredible. Now that it's been out for a while, many of the actors are now quite well known. Harrison Ford surprised me honestly, being so different from the type of character he usually lays. My favorite role he's ever done. I love Sean Young in the movie, as well as Daryl Hannah. These actors portrayed their characters so excellently I could quite possibly never get tired of it. The list is nearly endless; Edward James Olmos, James Hong, and Rutager Hayer as Roy, my favorite character in it all. The way the story flows, it starts us off believing the Replicants are devious and cold hearted machines, as you might discern in that opening murder scene. But as the story continues you will realize that is far from the actual plot at all. By the time it's over; don't be surprised if you feel Deckard is the actual antagonist instead of the initial speculation. This is not the lone-cop, gun-slinger, film, by far.And the look of the film, it's just remarkable. The lighting creates a very dark and gloomy atmosphere. That's one aspect in itself for which many like myself can love it. The cinematography is just exhilarating, a dirty world populated with silhouettes and a rather dystopia-like vision of our future. And the very stirring part of it all that is wasn't all that fictional of a world to envision. That story took place in 2019, and it's now in 2010, and yet watching it I felt like it was a future Earth might is still very susceptible too. Themes of pollution, over-population, among so many other things within these magnificent shots, it probably prompts most the loss of humanity that the advent of technology brings. There's just no way to watch 'Blade Runner' and receive no feeling from it. My first viewing of it lead me to believe it was simply a well told story. But it will do more after each view, so with that said definitely see the 'the Final Cut'.",10,2,5,22 November 2010
Toy Story 3," 2010's Greatest Acheivment!!
","With Toy Story 3 I had expected to see an all-right contender compared to the first two films. But damn was I wrong! This film will blow you away on many aspects. First off, just the transition of the animation since the first film back in the 1990s. It's simply beautiful and looks so epic and realistic I swore I was there in this Pixar film. Secondly, a screenplay so vivid and surprisingly smart that nothing is overdone, nothing is drawn out, it's just simply brings the trilogy to a climax. For example, in my humble opinion I believe 'The Incredibles' ultimately tried too hard to be a real action flick when it should've stuck to the laughs. And 'Chicken Little' was so downright not funny and overly childish it hurt to watch.Here we get a rich story that truth be told is a little darker than the others but nothing a child can't handle. The story is adventurous and suspenseful at just the right mixture, with plenty of laugh-out-loud comedy. Thirdly, we get the majority of our characters back and let's not lie; by the end of the movie I guarantee you'll shed tears. It's just something you would not expect for Disney honestly, well for Pixar yes. 'Finding Nemo', 'Wall-E', and 'Up' all serve as Class A films, but this film goes beyond that even. That's probably due to the fact that it's a trilogy and all, but a well done trilogy. This movie has done what most live-action trilogies have epically failed to do: present a good start with more than likable characters and a good story and actually keep that greatness going till the finish. And a highly captivating finish at that, with enough well-played drama, humor, and sadness blended together perfectly for people of all ages to enjoy. Once this film's successful run in theaters was up, I bought the damn bootleg to keep on enjoying. That's just how awed I was. And I know without a doubt none will find a single reason to dislike this film or even a single aspect to pick apart.",10,2,3,29 September 2010
Beowulf," Hoping It Had Been Live Action
","I'm surprised to see such a film coming from Robert Zemericks, I must say. Finally a movie on that epic poem of Beowulf that I read so much about in high school. Of course, I was expecting to see live action and to get the animation was a bit of a downer. It may look pretty close, but nothing beats the real deal.For the voice cast we have some very good actors and actresses selected, like Angelina Jolie and Anthony Hopkins. Playing Beowulf is Ray Winstone, who does great by the way. Grendel is a hell of a lot different than I always had imagined him. When I first read about it I had pictured him as a more reptilian type of being butÂ…yeah, he's kind of hard to describe in the film. Voiced by Crispin Glover, it was a more or less bad choice. Aside that, many differences between the poem and the film are present, some good, and some bad. Beowulf being a somewhat flawed man on the inside, something somewhat enjoyable. King Hrothgar being a womanizing alcoholic was something I found no point in honestly. However, the whole story arc concerning Grendel's mom as a seductress rather than a monster was unexpected and fun to figure out. First time I saw it, it definitely didn't hit me. How Grendel and the Dragon at the climax are children of power-hungry men, Hrothgar and Beowulf. It's really in-between the lines but a very interesting development. I just hate how she never diesÂ…a major annoyance considering Beowulf killed her in the poem not long after Grendel had been slain.Alan Silvestri is not a bad composer, and the animation is beautiful so all in all Zemericks did well. I guess it all depends whether or not you take it seriously because it's not live action. Kind of a 'The Incredibles' type of thing. Animation belongs to family films, and gruesome hero flicks belong live-action.",7,1,2,30 September 2010
X2: X-Men United," The Best Hero Flick Ever?
","Bryan Singer really proves himself here, bringing us possibly the GREATEST superhero film ever. If you loved the first film, this one will exceed your expectations and beyond!! I'll begin with the incredible story, which will involve audiences throughout, done by Zak Penn thankfully. This time around much more screen time is devoted to personalization these characters and Singer makes sure each one gets their adequate amount of screen time.The cast is fantastic I must say. We have all the actors from the previous film, plus several new and thrilling characters. Night Crawler, played by Alan Cumming, is no doubt my favorite of them. Aaron Stanford is Pyro, another character well done. Hugh Jackman plays Wolverine perfectly, creating a sense of mystery with the mutant. The action is mind blowing, no less than awe-inspiring. From the White House assassination attempt to Pyro's firery attack against the police, all the scenes are unique and have an intensity only Singer could deliver. Which reminds me, Kelly Hu is sexy as Lady Death Strike and the fight between her and Wolverine is by far one of the best action sequences ever filmed.Singer sets up a dark atmosphere of conflict, not too unlike our own discrimination and hate-filled world. It is this major component that shows that only through unity can intolerance be defeated, the movie's definite theme. To add to this film's greatness, John Ottoman's score is incredible, if not one of his very best. It definitely keeps the mood of the film, whether heroic, tormented, or tragic. Single handedly one of the best hero flicks ever filmed.",10,4,8,13 May 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Trilogy Complete
","The third is simply an undeniably great movie. The enormous length of it is pretty interesting thru out and it certainly qualifies as one of the most epic films ever unleashed onto the mainstream audiences. Its epic battles and dazzling shots will mesmerize and quite a bit happens. The composition of music by Howard Shore is beautiful as ever, but aside all this I want to comment on the theatrical cut. It had no business existing, seeing as there are so many gaping holes in the theatrical cut. The fate of Christopher Lee's Sarumon is pushed feebly to the side and the love story between Faramir (the great David Wenham) and Miranda Otto comes completely out of left field, much to my distaste. The biggest disappointment is with the Witch-King. There is a bad-ass scene where an underling asks the shadowy figure of Gandalf's fate, to which the Witch-King replies 'I will break him'. It was so awesome, and you get the foreshadowing an epic battle is to take place. And yet in the movie this is completely ignored, what the f*ck?! Basically the only true way to watch 'Return of the king' is to purchase the uncut version. The theatrical cut is just an abomination that exist solely to please the mainstream audiences. This angers me when you think of all the awards the film won; all that praise for basically a sell-out version. If you're going to have all this build up in the previous films, please don't allow me to walk into the theater to have my expectations shat on. Especially concerning the duo of Frodo Baggins and his constant counterpart Samwise Gamgee. There's such a strong homosexual innuendo the relationship between them is laughable, and then out of nowhere at the end Peter Jackson thrust into Sam's wedding. When it's all said and done though the movie is one I recommend, but to don't say you've seen the film if all you saw was the theatrical cut. The theatrical cut is a damn lie.",9,0,1,4 July 2011
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The One That Started It All
","The one that started it all, the original classic, 'Star Wars'. From the vivid imagination of a young teen named George Lucas comes an epic sci-fi tale that inspired millions. I am proudly one of those millions, having seen this film at the age of ten. This is probably one of the best films of all time and many can see why.Despite a lack of CGI, audiences were shown a brand new world of epic proportions unbound by the real one. The SFX were just so astonishing for their time, how could one not be amazed? That final space battle on the surface of the Death Star will leave one jaw-dropped and the cast is perfect. Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher, as 'Blue Harvest' so eloquently put it, do have their single fleeting moment of stardom, but I guess the real star is Harrison Ford. And let's not forget Anthony Daniels as C3-PO. And of course the icon of evil himself, Darth Vader!! The almost classical tone of the score is unforgettable and the most identifiable theme music of all time is finally unveiled. John Williams really does have a knack for creating single pieces of music so timeless it seems they'll never be forgotten.In time, this original would become 'Episode IV', as the prequel trilogy began, to some, destroy the reputation of the Star Wars saga. To me, despite what damage the prequel trilogy has caused, the originals, including this film in itself, will never lose their popularity or place in film history.",10,1,2,26 June 2009
300," Epic To Say The Least!
","Grade: AThis film by Zack Snyder, who is slowly starting to become one of my favorite directors, tells truly epic tale. When I first saw this film all I watched were the fight scenes (thanks to the miracle of TiVo), but upon buying the DVD, I've come to fully experience the film the way I was meant to.Based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, this is also based on an actual historical event. But with a twist obviously. So be it, the story flows nicely and the fantasy aspect of it keeps viewers interested. In fact, one will find it in contrast to the 'original' film '300 Spartans'. With Snyder behind it, this is just a whole nother caliber. How the director has the movie filmed it reminds us it's based on a 'comic' book, but it hardly distracts.The action scenes are epic and The Battle of Thermopylae will live on forever now. Watching the Spartans hack down the Persian Army never gets old, does it? The pride and honor of those 300 is what makes it a great story and also what makes the story so moving. Gerard Butler is perfect as King Leonidas, who has a final climatic showdown with King Xerxes himself, played by Rodrigo Santoro. Despite the epic battles and fantastic thrills, my favorite scene definitely is the final one as Dilios, played by David Weinham, gives the final speech. The music composed by Tyler Bates is so emotional and empowering it really up raises the film even further. Gotta love the sound track!'Today we rescue a world from mysticism and tyranny, and usher in a future brighter than any can imagine. Give thanks men, to Leonidas, and the brave 300! To victory!'",9,3,4,9 April 2009
Ran," 'Are there no godsÂ…no Buddha? If you exist hear me...Is it such fun to see men weep?'
","A truly thought provoking bit of dialogue from one of Akira Kuorsawa's best works, a true masterpiece in the world of film. The film is so visually stunning one may completely forsake the meanings behind those images or worse walk away from the film confused. In response to that, another character remarks, 'It is the gods who weep. They see us killing each otherÂ…over and over since time began. They can't save us from ourselves.' To me this may quite possibly be Kurosawa's greatest achievement among many.Firstly, and rightly so, is the sheer greatness of the acting in this movie. I could go on about the greatness of each actor's performance, seeing as every performance stands out so well; no character is over shadowed or unforgettable. Instead I'll focus on the gorgeous story treatment and this film's themes. As I'm sure anybody who's reading this review knows, the story is an adaptation of Shakespeare's 'King Lear.' Kurosawa uses Japanese history very well so, portraying quite faultlessly a warlord ruled Japan. This film, due to it being his most big budget production, has quite an epic feel to it as well. A vast landscape shot accompanied by the awesome cinematography creates a beautiful and majestic aura to the atmosphere as a whole. And the costume design is done artistically, very worthy of the award it won.Despite all that beauty, anyone who truly understands the film will realize it is easily Kurosawa's most nihilistic-toned film. The score itself is dark, brooding, stomach churning and never uplifts onto a joyous melody. The whole underlying theme in itself is the near pointlessness of our existence in this world. How man is naturally power hungry and lusts almost always for only their desires, no matter what they may be. Regardless of whom must one must hurt or toss aside to attain it, we will do it, for better or for most cases, worst. We naturally do this, and are more than willing to shed blood and commit betrayal to have what we want. There's a classic sense of Shakespeare tragic irony at work here, about how loyalty can be misplaced, and before we can even have a chance to make up for it the world can take away our redemption. After all his losses, including his power and sanity, all Hidetora wanted was forgiveness, and yet the opportunity was forever lost in death. His other two sons are easily seduced by the promise of power and intimacy but both also end up a victim of their own vile ways. And yet, it is not God's duty to punish the wicked, nor to praise the righteous. This seen many times in this movie, but is brought out to the fullest when the gruesome death of lady Keade comes to light. This character had lost her whole family at the hands of a war for power long ago, and lost everything but her own scarred brother. She coped, as she said to Hidetora in a great scene, by way of prayer to Buddha, a holy deity. Religion is her savior, but no amount of devotion saved her in the end. The same goes for her brother who sits atop the ruins of his childhood home, but has no idea his sister isn't returning. An image of Buddha she gave to him falls down below amongst the rocks, neither worsening nor benefiting his predicament. Man is alone to deal with his own self-constructed problems.'Don't cry. Its how the world is made. Men prefer sorrow over joy, suffering over peace.'",10,1,4,30 March 2011
The Thin Red Line," 'In this world, a man himself is nothing. And there ain't no world but this once.'
","One of the greatest war films of all time, if not the best one of the 90s. And yes, I do include Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan'. I own both films and every time I watched 'Saving Private Ryan' I couldn't help but feel something was missing. Then I finally saw this movie and I felt complete. To be clear, this movie's beautiful cinematography fuses with narration from multiple characters and an orgasmic score to create a very surreal, at times dream-like atmosphere.A great aspect of the film is its often poetic dialogue coupled with beautiful images. One of the subtle notions of the film hinted at thru out; the camera continuously captures the picturesque nature of the island where death reigns supreme. Does nature mock man for killing one another? Is it indifferent? This is a perplexing and tragic question the movie poses. It also displays the brutality of men during war, quite effectively portraying the frailty of the soldiers on both sides. One of my favorite scenes has to be when Arie Verveen as Pfc. Charlie Dale sits down next to a dying Japanese soldier and says to him 'I'm gonna sink my teeth into your liver, you're dyin'. You see them birds up there? They're gonna eat you raw. Where you're going you're not coming back from.'Accompanying all this is a score by the great Hans Zimmer that quite frankly is one of his best. At times roaring with ferocity and yet at many times full of melancholy, the music of the movie can shift moods seamlessly and without ever feeling out of place. And the battle scenes are incredibly shot, the camera often following soldiers right thru the chaos of war. Cementing all this is a spectacular cast, probably one of the most impressive I have ever seen in the war genre. Nick Nolte, John Cusack, John Travolta, Jim Caviezel, and Sean Penn there's talent tearing at the seams in this one.I would love to someday be able to purchase this so called director's cut.",10,2,3,5 July 2012
Fantastic Four," Pretty Redundant
","Probably one of my least favorite of the super hero genre. I never really cared for the Fantastic Four from the get go against Marvel giants like Spider-Man, the X-Men, and the Hulk. They seemed, how do I putt this, lame? The characters are uninvolving and bore you to death with predictable, campy and almost childish performances. Ioan Gruffudd as a lead was dismal, unheroic and came off as an extremely lackluster protagonists. Chris Evans did his role so pathetically generic I felt like I was watching a bad Saturday morning cartoon. Jessica Alba, even reduced own to her underwear, could not sway me to forgive her pitiful performance. None of the characters came off as likable , and I don't really care if they fail or succeed, so in the end the film basically never even got my full attention. Michael Chiklis' character was the only interesting one really, but that's just one character amongst so many failed ones.Julian McMahon plays the main antagonists and where as he does pretty decent, two big hitters: (1) his whole story arc seems like a rip-off from the first 'Spider-man' film back in 2002, no explanation needed, and (2) he's barely in the movie. I mean at times I literally forgot there was even a villain at all.The story feels pathetic as well, filled with pointless scenes of juvenile arguments, montages galore, cheesy romantic lines; this film rally works hard to make you cringe at every turn. Compounded is the fact that the film offers little action. There was pretty cool scene at the bridge, but the climatic end battle was incredibly short and was over in under three minutes.Director Tim Story has reached a new pinnacle though: the biggest waste of millions of dollars I've seen in film making in a long time.",5,1,2,27 January 2011
Pineapple Express," One of the Best Comedies In A While!!
","If you thought 'Super Bad' was insanely funny, then you haven't seen anything yet!! From that film's producer, Judd Apatow, and the director David Green Wood, comes a comedy that practically equals or even goes beyond 'Super Bad'. I know some who haven't seen it are probably thinking:' Is that even possible?' Indeed it is, indeed it is. This is first off accomplished by the very nicely done story which Seth Rogen himself helped to right. Gary Cole and Rosie Perez are perfect together as the 'bad guys', serving up well done performances.Besides the villains, the screenplay introduces some very interesting characters. It presents the usual buddy film but it's done so well. Seth Rogen and Danny McBride are laugh out loud hilarious no doubt, but to me the real star is James Franco. It's like he was born to play this role and people like myself fall in love with the character. The 'buddy' scenario is just so damn enjoyable in this flick. Some have criticized the film's violence which admittedly at first view had me thinking i was watching some sort of Quentin Tarantino film. But now I've come to realize that despite the fact that it is rather realistic and in the case of the 'ear' situation (lol) pretty gross, it all blends in well with the comedy is really a necessary part of it. In a movie filled with drug lords and hit men, there would naturally be some unfortunate yet funny as hell deaths. Therefore, I can honestly say ''Pineapple Express' is one of my all time favorite comedies.And Oh yeah, before I forget, 'F*ck the police!!'. lmfao!! My favorite line in the film no doubt.",10,6,12,23 December 2009
Jackie Brown," Among Tarantino's Best
","Supposedly this is Tarantino's most unsatisfying work. However, as anyone can easily tell it's because it's missing the trademark Tarantino bloodshed, perhaps overall less intense. But as I've seen for myself, that isn't so. In fact, I prefer this film any day over his latest film, 'Inglorious Bastards', which had so many over -the-top moments it felt silly in comparison to his usual work. Based on a novel by Elmore Leonard, which I have not read. Despite this, our director brings his full game to this film and it shows in every shot. The story flows quite nicely and the comedy is well played and natural. As with any production of this particular director, there is never a dull moment and the tension can be heart wrenching at times.And to keep all of this in sync, we have one of his most memorable cast to date. Samuel L. Jackson is as menacing as ever as Ordell, while Chris Tucker is incredibly funny with his role. In fact I find Jackson's performance as stirring as Jules in 'pulp Fiction', although here it is clear he's the antagonist. Robert DeNiro is just as excellent as you would naturally expect, while Bridget Fonda is just as sexy as she is talented as Melanie, one of the most intriguing characters in this movie. Michael Keaton is the ATF agent, and I loved his performance as I always do. I was surprised to see Pam Grier and Robert Forster have such a natural on-screen chemistry, it fascinates me. Both nailed their performances hard and did excellently.As I said previously, the plot swerves and turns this way and that and I loved every minute of it. And the sound track was fresh, delivering a very hip, 'Blaxploitation' type of feel to it all. I mean overall, I enjoyed this film more than say the 'Kill Bill' films (not to dethrone them off my own personal lists, as they are great films) and it is worthy of every film and Tarantino's fans respect.A...'Man, I ain't geetin' no trunk, for no minute!!'",10,1,4,4 January 2011
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," No Less Than Epic
","This is the cream of the crop for not just the original trilogy, but the entire saga. To me, this film even surpasses the original. Everything is finally perfect, for just this one time. The tone is generally dark and somber, something Episode VI tried to live up to. But thanks to things called Ewoks it didn't quite keep the tone steady. The comic relief is given at the right moment and isn't over done.Rather, this film puts all the characters through their own turmoil and emotional battles. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher's love story is more drawn out and ends in a somewhat tragic way you could say. Luke, still played by good ole Mark Hamil, is finally on the road to becoming a Jedi Knight but his crusade against the Empire hits a stop as we find out one little detail left out in the previous one: 'Luke, I am your father.''Nooooooo!!!! No!!!!!!' Yes, Hamil could've done a little better here, but it doesn't take away from the moment as the horrible truth comes out. Lucas really outdoes himself here. Now the audiences can't wait for the third, and at the time, final installment. The action here is also well delivered, this film introducing much more environments than the last. The SFX are better than ever, especially on Hoth with the AT-TT Walkers and asteroid scene. The lightsaber duel at the climax is much improved from the rather stiff one in the original and we really see the extent of Vader's power. The music is, as always, superb, one of John William's best ever. Episode V is no less than epic.",10,2,5,26 June 2009
Sin City," 'She doesn't quite cut his head off. She turns him into a Pez dispenser.'
","Frank Miller is a graphic novel icon, his works becoming ever more popular due to the advent of numerous film adaptations. Probably one of the finest ever offered up to an audience has been 'Sin City'. I'd just like to note that while I definitely enjoyed the theatrical cut of the film, I prefer the extended cut. The special edition DVD (I thoroughly believe that blu-ray is a very big scam, and all I indulge in is the blu-ray player itself seeing as they boast it upgrades DVDs to 1080p regardless) allows you to watch each of the four stories in their entirety without the intercutting and you can watch them in any order you like. That being said, my personal favorite of the stories would have to be 'The Hard Good-Bye', which stars Mickey Rourke as the bad-ass Marv who is after the murderer of his star-crossed lover Goldy (Jaime King). He's the probably the most masochistic of the protagonist (though rightfully so considering what he's up against) yet he still comes off as a very likable and you could say almost heart-warming character. Even though I enjoyed the 'Lord of the Rings', I never cared for Hobbits but here Elijah Wood is fitting and plays the role of Kevin quite awesomely.The movie has one of the greatest cast ever assembled, starring the likes of Nick Stahl, Carla Gugino, Bruce Willis, Rutger Hauer, Rosario Dawson, and yes even Jessica Alba in one of her few good roles. The world set up by Miller is brought to screen by Director Robert RodrÃ­guez who does have a knack for stylish action films. One thing I definitely want to say is that of the many, many comic book and graphic novel adaptations Hollywood produces each year, this is probably one of the most panel-for-panel accurate ones out there. I would know, as an avid reader of Miller's work. The film, in a similar fashion to say 'Mulholland Drive' or 'Batman: Mask of the Phantasm', is a neo-noir treat, which if you're a classic film buff should be easy to see with its snazzy dialogue and distinct use of shadows. Plus the score by John Debney and Graeme Revell also alludes to this nicely. The use of CGI is elaborate but necessary to make a unique presentation for the visuals, which as I said before matches the books perfectly, right down to the awesome use of color.The tales being told are violent, sensual but an awesome film experience not to be missed.",10,3,4,22 February 2012
Windtalkers," Action Lovers Rejoice
","If you love action, regardless of the realism sacrificed, then yes you will love this. And I'm talking for beginners of the war genre as a whole. Allow me to elaborate. A lot of the cinematography and scenery is beautiful and the location shots are for the most part well done. The costumes and weapons look great and accurate. However, there are many parts I find laughable about this movie. For one, the character development is weak despite an attempt to tell a tale not known by many; that of the Navajo Code Talkers. Speaking of which, the non-Caucasian characters are barely gone into at all and very clichÃƒÂ©. The movie spends the majority of its focus on the mere gore of war, which definitely is a necessary factor in any movie about war. It maintains the sad realism of war, but this film relies on that alone and nothing else. To add to this Nicholas Cage makes sport out of the bloodiest conflicts of World War II by single-handedly wiping gout whole regiments of Japanese soldiers. When I watched it, I felt as if I was watching a Rambo film from the 80s. And I'm not talking the original 'First Blood'; I'm talking the popular but incredibly unrealistic sequel which is probably the most popular.",5,1,1,9 May 2011
The Runaways," A Fun Film to Check out
","The sub genre of biographies on the most glorious musicians of our time has grown much over time. One of my favorites has to be 'The Temptations' (directed by ), and this film is up there for me. Now like all genres, these films have a fairly general chain of events. A nobody craves to share talent with world, manages to reach limelight, but then is consumed by drugs and falls. Do I find this a weakness? No not necessarily, for every genre has its own tendencies. The super hero must save his love interest, Tom Cruise must dance in almost every movie he's in, Godzilla has to stomp on Tokyo, and every horror has the dumbass who calls out to the darkness expecting a friend. Don't even get me started on the near pointlessness of romantic comedies. These conventions aren't always present, but still often are and it's not always where you're going with a film but just how you get there. And also consider the fact this film and others like it are more or less pieces of history, so running into these conventions isn't really avoidable. Celebrities have a tendency to do stupid things.For this film, the very enjoyable aspects lie in its sensuality and casting choices. The jail bait Dakota Fanning is bound to draw attention, and this is probably the only film in which I can partake starring Kristen Stewart. They're well aware their playing guitar legends, and so they both do quite well. And Michael Shannonas is just cool. The performances are pretty good and the soundtrack, if you're a fan of Joan Jett and her work, is damn good. Be sure to check this one out.",8,2,5,1 February 2012
Donnie Darko," Unique, Odd, Subtle, Bold...I Could Go On....
","One night I was browsing threw channels, bored as hell, and I come across a peculiar movie on of all channels MTV. Jake Gyllenhaal is in an completely empty movie theater, beside him a snoozing Jena Malone, while only a seat away is a way is a man in a demonic bunny suit. I have hundreds of other choices. but I chose this film,which was half over and that I knew very little about. And yet I could not look away, and loathed every commercial between each segment. After that brief encounter I went to my local f.y.e. and bought the DVD, the director's cut to be exact. And ever since, this has been one of my all time favorite films.the atmosphere set up by the ominous way it's shot is just heart wrenching. Every time I watch it I can not take my eyes away for even a second. Richard Kelly is just a f*cking genius. it mixes so many genres, among them sci-fi, thriller, horror, even a teen drama I suppose. It's all blended together so excellently, it feels like a genre all its own. Heightening and sharpening this is just great, ominous, dark and gripping cinematography that definitely gives off the feel of a horror, but it is laden with so many other aspects. the choice of setting, both in time and place, allows the soundtrack to fit in quite well. Let alone the great songs, the score by Michael Andrews is just haunting and embodies the film perfectly.And the cast is so damn great! Everyone was so perfectly attuned to their character, and they all were were so enjoyable to watch. Whether it be Beth Grant as the conservative Kitty Farmer, or the other performance I enjoyed so much, that of Holmes Osborne as Mr. Darko. Patrick Swayze was awesome and funny, and Jena Malone played the very intriguing Gretchen Ross. The images of Frank are probably some of the most terrifying and memorable shots I can recount.Jake Gyllenhaal will forever be Donnie Darko to me. His performance is so similar to a phase we all go through in our lives, and undoubtedly some of us still struggle with it daily. Audiences will just feel so connected with these characters that they become real, which explains why many a fan read the book and probably believe this film is truly non-fiction. Despite the perplexing story I can almost see myself in his position.There are so many ways to interpret this film I could write three reviews really. It is obviously many things wrapped in one. Some view Donnie as a symbolic Jesus, while some others a complex story of 'possibilities'. I view it primarily as Donnie Darko's journey to enlightenment in a world he fills isolated both physically and spiritually. Along his journey Frank is guiding him towards the ultimate crusade to save all of mankind in more ways than one, destroying the chains of conservative philosophy, seemingly religion and fate itself, which is displayed threw Drew Barrymore's character and others. I highly recommend this film to anyone who is willing to think deeply about what they are viewing, and those who want mediocre predictable trash will not find it here. I also recommend viewing the The Director's Cut, though regardless it will take repeated viewing s to fully grasp it all.So, with all that said, I only have one question: Oh, please, tell me, how exactly does one suck a f*ck?' Good old Donnie Darko",10,1,3,24 January 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Shia LaBeouf Killed Starscream? I call shenanigans!
","Let me start by saying the release of this movie literally crept up on me. Despite its flaws, I was actually left anxious enough to wait the sequel in 2009. However, I was disappointed to the extent I was hardly looking forward to this one. My low expectations were met, and once more what could have been more simply wasn't. Let's just walk through this one.First off, the characters sucked ore than ever. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson do nothing but bark orders every five seconds and yell 'What the hell is going on?' multiple times. Shia LaBeouf's acting barely qualifies as acting at all as he resorts to mostly his 'Even Steven' twitching antics with dialogue so predictable I hated every minute of his screen time. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley isn't much of an improvement acting wise, after all the movie opens up with a shot of her cute little butt in her undies and just like Ms. Fox only serves as eye candy. Her acting was never high on my list because she's a model, not an actress! And we've all seen enough of the Wittwicky parents damn it, its overkill. John Turturro is back to make a fool out of himself as usual and nothing shocking really happens to the human characters. We're shown the same old clichÃ© over-the-top comedy skits over-laden with teen angst crap I can't bring myself to laugh anymore.Now to the guys I really came to see the movie for It's a mixed bag here, one I can't go into without revealing a few spoilers. It's all 85% epic bullsh*t. The majority of the villains aside Sentinel had hardly any screen time what so ever. Starscream suffers a humiliating death at the hands of Witiwicky, which made me want to go home right on the spot. Ironhide dies, which was sad, but not a single moment did the movie to mourn him. In fact, not a single line of dialogue implies that anybody misses him. More new autobots, voiced by talent s such as Francesco Quinn and John DiMaggio, but the camera never remain son them for more than a few seconds. The tiny robots, which thankfully aren't as perverted and annoying as last time, get more screen time. Shockwave was amazing but barely in the movie. Laserbeak was pretty bad-ass himself. Sadly, Megatron literally does nothing the whole movie, till at the last minute is actually mocked by the wannabe actress. Who for some reason he doesn't kill her and then kills by a wounded Optimus in less than seven seconds. What a miraculous send-off.The score borrows heavily from 'The Dark knight', abuses an Aerosmith song, and over uses the song Iridescent by Linkin Park. In short it sucked. The action is all death-defying stunts and awesome CGI, no doubt entertaining but after two whole movies and this one's strenuous runtime, it just gets old. I'm afraid Michael bay has out done himself with the number of slow-motion shots, explosions and agonizing amount of detail on those CGI monstrosities., and he's rolling in the money for it. With this movie he's not just raping my childhood, he's raping cinema in general.",5,4,10,4 July 2011
Born on the Fourth of July," Pure Awesomeness
","If you haven't seen Oliver Stone's Vietnam trilogy, buy yourself a copy of each. If you've only seen 'Platoon' (1986), then put simply you missed the return home. The film focuses on the horror of not just the war, but what it really entailed to bring it home with you. Like 'Platoon', one of the movie's golden features is its stunning cast.If you're a Cruise fan or not, here he is undeniably great. He portrayed the grueling state of post-combat rehabilitation, the tragedy of discovering everything you've fought for is a lie and quite brilliantly how easy it is to inadvertently become a propaganda-believing automaton. You feel his pain, but more importantly his disillusionment. The rest of the cast and production team do well to re-create the turmoil of the era, capturing civil unrest as the displacement of the returning veterans. The most striking thing to me is how no movie doesn't hold back at all, and can be pretty brutal emotionally on the characters, of course only painting a picture of how brutal the real world really is. Raymond J. Barry and Caroline Kava do exceptionally well and oh did I mention Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger manage to co-star as well? You can't top that quite frankly. Adding to all this is a glorious composition of music by none other than John Williams.The film boasts nightmarish visuals, an incredible score and a true sense of the times. It all culminates in one of my favorite film endings ever, I really recommend this movie.",Null,2,3,23 May 2012
The Social Network," 'Â…..You pretentious d*uche bag!'
","B+Despite avoiding the direct title, this film will forever be known as the 'Facebook movie'. In the same fashion as Oliver Stone's 'Wall Street', this film's focus is on the greed for money and thirst for power that drives people. I hear people constantly go on about how the film was shot, and yes, I acknowledge that it does look rather fantastic, with a fine polished look to the images.And the performances do surprise you. I'm not familiar with Andrew Garfield, but he did quite well. Brenda Song of Disney channel stars, who I thought would anger me, actually serves up a nice performance. Armie Hammer I must definitely give kudos to and Timberlake, another popular pop icon, does very nicely. And then we come to Jesse Eisenburg, the perpetual Gordon Gekko of the movie. Now the problem is, I don't care what any critic says, Eisenburg literally kept the same facial expression during the ENTIRE movie. His talent lay in several smart-aleck quips he delivers thru out the run time, culminating in his eventual hollow victory. At least it's portrayed as hollow, seeing as he sits there refreshing a Facebook page belonging to a girl he humiliated. Speaking of which, because I assume the character was an ex, I had no idea today's college students, with all our texting, e-mails, and whatnot, actually passed notes in classrooms, but I digress.The tactic is clear, to tell a story about the abandoned morality of the business man, fueled by a contemporary techno-like score I didn't care much for, leaving us with a climax where a substantial profit is made, some profit more than others, and man ya character feel cheated and no one appears truly happy. IT's charming to look at but like Eisenburg's character it feels hollow. Director Fincher definitely knows how to tell a story, and how to say mouthfuls about his characters (some of them), but the story everyone praise seems off to me. I'm not a guy who roots for the hero; after all, I find Michael Douglass' portrayal of Wall Street tycoon Gordon Gekko to be one of my favorite roles of all time. I deeply enjoyed the character, but the ones here I repeat, just come off as hollow.",7,0,1,1 February 2012
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," 'For the unrighteous, the cup of life holds everlasting damnation.'
","A+ The Indiana Jones original trilogy, before it became an anthology with its blundered fourth film, is one of the rare treats in cinema. Here you have a great setup, and it is followed thru for the vast majority of the sequels. In saying so I might as well mention that in my opinion the most perfect trilogies in all of movie history are the Toy Story films, the original Star Wars, and my beloved Evil Dead series. It's debatable whether one likes 'Return of the Jedi', 'Temple of Doom', or 'Army of Darkness', but either way none of those films caused the respective series to crash and burn like 'Batman Forever'.'The Last Crusade' is an epic success on so many levels it could very well be the best of all three. First off, you get to see Indiana Jones as a kid which was just an awesome sequence. Secondly, it's such an incredibly strong cast. Harrison ford and Sean Connery play off each other so well the father-son concept is both comedic yet emotional. I just never tire of their scenes together. Returning are both Denholm Elliott as Marcus Brody and John Rhys Davies as Sallah, contributing nicely. Alison Doody may be my favorite actress of the three. Karen Allen was pretty awesome, I never really cared for Kate Capshaw, but Doody has a sexy charm to her that appeals the most to me because she pulls of the role of the villainess so well. The joke of how promiscuous she is never gets old. Michael Byrne was pretty menacing, and I really liked the character played by Kevork Malikyan. After all the titular quote is uttered by him.The story is well written, just like the others paying homage to the 30s serial heroes. It's often sophisticated yet always fun, and the awe-inspiring action scenes are some of the best out of frankly all four. The score by John Williams is amazing, adding to the mystic quite nicely. 'The Last Crusade' is arguably one of Steven Spielberg's and George Lucas' best works.",10,4,7,14 July 2011
Jurassic Park," An Epic Film No Doubt
","Grade: A I don't know how people can possibly review this movie negatively. It's a ground breaking experience for its time, a time when most films were still struggling to break the limitations set by technology. And yet in 1993 (1992 in places like Japan) comes this marvel, and surely anyone would be stunned.I saw it around seven or eight and every kid that age is fascinated by dinosaurs. Aren't we all? To see them brought to life so realistically was astounding. My favorite scene in the film, if not film history is the T-Rex's emergence. Spielberg directs as he always does, making it seem so real. This was due to the aid of Michael Crichton, the original author. Now I've read the book and trust me the actual novel is a bit more graphic. The characters are not as plain as some have claimed. I believe more than good enough.Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum are excellent, and who doesn't love Laura Dern in some booty shorts (lolz)? Hammond is played by Richard Attenborough, a good choice. The drama is riveting and there is definitely a theme at work: it is not the role of man to play God, because when they do, 'nature finds an away.' The action is fueled by pure adrenaline and beauty at times, but most common is sheer terror, as in the famous kitchen scene. It has an edge that will have you biting your nails every time. Gotta love the Velociraptor screech; it's just so alien, you know? And during all of this is John Williams, including that unforgettable theme. Unless you are a loser and don't remember itÂ…And so, haters back off and regard this film as the classic it is. Give the cast credit, even though none can deny the real stars were never really there (or from time to time represented by animatronics robots). They created all the wonder and fascination for the big screen and I state that this is one of Spielberg's greatness.",10,3,5,3 June 2010
Evil Dead II," Groovy ; D
","In this one, Ash finally picks up the chainsaw, yeah!! I have to say upon initial viewing I was dumbfounded but exhilarated. Usually horror films are unintentionally funny, I assume when they are trying real hard to be scary. I won't call any one out, but I'm sure you can think of a few, several, lots, more than a few.lol This film got me into the idea of dark humor and for that along I admire it. Bruce Campbell is terrific in this film and the cast is just secondary to him in reality. The comedy fits in quite nicely with the horror, which truth be told can be quite scary at times.Joseph Do Luca returns for the score, and it still fits the film quite well. The make-up by Mark Shostrom is more than enough to hold its own against the original, and there's some pretty gory scenes in this one as well. The photography is just as great and it's just a very good visual experience in itself. Ash seems to be somewhat adjusting to the cabin from hell and its demons in this film, exemplified in one of my favorite scenes in the film; where quite disturbingly, everything in the room begins to laugh manically. And Ash, in his madness, joins them. It was out right funny and to die for, but probably the best example of this is when he decides to use the chainsaw near the climax, and says 'Groovy' :D",10,2,3,22 November 2010
V for Vendetta," A Well-Orchestrated Masterpiece
","A+ Well, to say I'm impressed is an understatement. From the Wachowaski brothers comes a truly great story that riddles the mind and treats us to very well fleshed out characters. Unlike the 'The Matrix', here we mostly rely on the story to drive the movie, and that it does beautifully. The story is complex, deep and perhaps even convoluted the first go around. But upon further viewing, which trust me you will be moved to do many times over, it will become all the more clear.The cast is excellent, with Natalie Portman delivering a thrilling performance. I really love Stephen Rea in this movie, as well as john Hurt. Everyone had their characters perfect. Not one weak performance in the whole movie. Hugo Weaving takes the cake as 'V', a role where he embodied pain, insanity, yet a clear heroic image. Mind you this is based on a graphic novel, but the story could fool some into believing it's not. The action shots are definitely Matrix-styled, but they don't feel out of context what so ever. Why? Because there's such an emotional build up to them.Cinematographer Adrian Bidle did his job well, with exhilarating shots that will amaze you, R.I.P. Dario Marianelli's score is moving and it helps the movie really flow quite nicely. All in all, 'V for Vendetta' is an unforgettable treat that has a strong political message and great action, strengthened by strong performances and excellent music.",10,1,7,10 November 2010
