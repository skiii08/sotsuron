The Blair Witch Project," This is the worst movie ever made
","'The Blair Witch Project' is in my mind the worst movie in history. It is the most boring and non-entertaining movie I have seen; it goes absolutely know where. It is not at all scary, my heart not once started pounding, it was just still in boredom. I do not advise anybody to see this, please don't waste your time, nor energy seeing this. 0 out of 10",1,50,97,3 October 2000
Memento," Brilliant!!!, will keep you guessing until to end.
","I'm not going to say anything about the plot, except that it involves a man with short-term memory, Leonard (Guy Pearce). If you hear too much about the plot, it will ruin the experience.Now, this movie is one of the most beautifully crafted films ever made, the way it is shoot, the music and especially the directing by Christopher Nolan. The performances of Guy Pearce (Leonard) and Joe Pantoliano (Teddy) are absolutely brilliant. Carrie-Ann Moss (Natalie) is also good, but not brilliant. The way this film is told is so original and new, that I can't tell you, you have to see for yourself.The reason this film is so good, is that something like this has never been done before and I think movie fans such as myself, have been waiting for a movie like Memento that is so original, its finally good to see something different instead of all those stupid teen horrors, romantic comedy's and over budget action films, and so on, well you get my point.Memento is now in my favourite 10 films of all-time. So go out there and see this film, you won't be disappointed I promise. The ending will shock you, just as it did in The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects.10/10, 2 thumbs up, *****stars",10,0,1,26 April 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Masterpiece........
","This would have to be one of the best movies ever made. I wasn't a big fan of Ang Lee before this film, but I am sure now. He has made one off the best-made movies of all time. The fight scenes are the best kung fu and fighting scenes that have ever been brought to cinema, ok the quality may not be up to the standards off The Matrix, but they are breathtaking to watch, especially the roof top scenes and the fight in the forest. Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh are themselves, but Zhang Ziyi(Jen Yu) is excellent. The cinematography is as good as it gets. The scenery is absolutely beautiful and the music score is also excellent. The plot is nothing new, but hey who cares, when all that beauty is on the screen. And if you're worried about the subtitles, don't worry because it's not that bad at all, and it's still easy to follow. So do yourself a favour and go and see this film, 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,6 February 2001
The Matrix," Masterpiece........
","This film has it all. It has a great plot, brilliant performances; especially that of Laurence Fishburne(Morpheus) and Keanu Reeves(Neo) who is at his best. But best of all it has the most mind-blowing special effects and sounds to ever grace our screens, I mean they are amazing and it earned them 4 Academy Awards.This is in my top 5 favourite films of all time. All I can say to people out there who don't like this film, is that you are crazy and must have been on drugs while watching this film, because there are no faults in this film. The directing by the Wachowski brothers is excellent.Overall, if you haven't seen this film, do yourself a huge favourite and see it. It is likely to be the greatest sci-fi film you have ever seen.10 out of 10, 5 stars, 2 thumbs up",10,0,1,18 April 2001
