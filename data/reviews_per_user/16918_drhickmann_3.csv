Catch Me If You Can," A fun story, and true, apparently.
","This is a fun movie because it's a great story, based on fact, and kept my interest all the way.  What's not to like.  The acting is just fine and the story moves along nicely.  The only people who wouldn't like this are the the esthetes looking for a message.  Go see it and enjoy.",8,1,2,17 July 2003
Moulin Rouge!," I have come up with a single word which answers everything
","I've struggled with how to summarize this strange movie and have come up with a word that I believe describes it for most viewers and will help those who would enjoy it and those who would not.  Simply, the movie is absurd. If you are turned on by absurdity, as some apparently are, then by all means see this film.  But if you understand the commonly excepted meaning of absurdity, don't waste two hours of your life with this drivel.",Null,0,2,13 September 2003
The Legend of 1900," This movie is absolutely pivotal
","I have been having trouble lately in choosing good movies to see using the IMDB ratings.  I had thought that the input of hundreds if not thousands of people would on balance reveal the quality or lack thereof.  The rating for this movie proves my assumption was wrong and therefore the movie is absolutely pivotal for me.  It tells me that there is no reason any longer to waste time at IMDB reviewing the ratings and user comments, looking for the top 100 of this and that type of movie.  It's about as reliable as those corny referrals at Netflix that once you see e.g. a French movie they think you want to see any French movie.  This movie is so pathetic that words don't serve me in explaining the depths of mediocrity it has reached while the readers write glowing reports and ratings to the tune of the current 7.5 out of 10.  Ladies and gentlemen this high of a rating is insane!  The acting is poor, the characters aren't developed, the story is clumsily handled and incoherent, the directing is god-awful, the music is utterly forgettable and the timing is dreadful.  For anyone here with an IQ of 100 or above, disregard this sleep-inducing, over-rated by IMDB users, sophomoric nonsense.",Null,1,8,5 August 2004
