The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," OMG i really can't believe that , this is the first amazing twilight movie
","i'm not a huge twilight fan i liked the first one and hated the others , the fourth installment of the twilight saga is the best one out of the four for so many reasons : - the directing was impressive and amazing -the movie is not boring like the others -the acting was real and emotional - the story is not lame - the birth scene was just 'AMAZING' thanks to Kristen who played the part of Bella very very well in this one i'm expecting new millions of die-hard fans after Breaking Dawn part 1 . for the guy that rated the movie 0/10 just because you like Dracula and hate Pattinson !! well , first - i don't think you have the right to rate the movie 0/10 without watching it two- if you're a fan of Dracula go watch Dracula and let people enjoy their time i hate when people rate something without watching it ! this is just stupid !!!!",10,26,80,10 November 2011
