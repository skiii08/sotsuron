Spartacus," 'I have seen that movie half a dozen times and I still don't know who the real Spartacus is'
","I don't know how Michael Scott managed to sit through this movie 6 times. I've tried twice now to watch it. It's incredibly slow and boring and super long.
I can see some major influences from this film in the movie Gladiator, but I'll take Ridley Scott's version over Stanley Kubrick's. #hottake#hottakept2 I think Stanley Kubrick is super overrated.",6,0,1,23 March 2020
MASH," Watch the TV Show
",I'm a fan of the TV show always wanted to see the movie even though I figured it wouldn't be as good.The TV show you liked the main characters. In the movie I find them revolting and despicable. Incredibly insulting and disrespectful to women.It's easy to dislike Frank Burns in the tv show because he's a spineless sniveling wimp.But in the movie he's played by Robert Duvall. The only character who seems to have a spine and a well rounded moral compass.The humor also is very dry in the movie. I know it's a dark comedy but there's not much to find funny in any of the situations this film has to offer.I feel sorry for the women in this movie.The only thing good to come out of this movie is the Theme song which is absolutely incredible. And it inspired the TV show's theme song which is one of the greatest theme songs of all time. In my opinion.,4,0,2,9 January 2020
Yesterday," Meh
","It's pretty lazy. Somebody said what if? But didn't follow up on the Why.
Lots of hokey moments and scenes where you say, why did they react this way?There are only two good moments in this movie.
One when he plays his first Beatles song and everyone is blown away.The second part is also the strangest part of the movie. He meets an alive and elderly John Lennon. It's cool that since the Beatles dont exist that John Lennon gets to be alive, but it's really weird at the same time. (Also, John Lennon was kind of a jerk in real life.)There's a long build up you're waiting for answers in this movie and you don't get any. It's just happy the entire time.Lastly, Kate McKinnon plays a cartoon villain in this movie.",5,3,7,13 February 2020
Yesterday," Biggest missed opportunity
",For me the biggest missed opportunity in this movie is as he's getting hit by the bus they don't play the final Striking chord from 'A Day In The Life' as he's falling and hits the ground. It would have been perfect.,5,2,5,19 February 2020
Joker," 'A well-polished crap.'-My friend
","Beware the Mentally Ill!
Is that the message?
Or is it 'Overthrow the rich!'
I guess Joker isn't supposed to have a point, but still what are we supposed to take away from this?
The performance is great, I'll give it that, you can't take that away from it, but did we need to know Joker's origin story? I kind of like the mystery of he's just a guy who's crazy. It leaves more to the imagination. Also, Joker is supposed to be this criminal mastermind, and in this movie he's just a loser with mental problems. It's alright...Wayy darker than I expected. Leaves you with questions and there's a few things that aren't explained super well. I'm not expert but I feel like there could have been more of a 'transformation' of the character, but whatever. Who cares? Why am I writing this? I could be sleeping.",6,2,10,7 October 2019
Godzilla," So much potential wasted.
","In my opinion the trailer released for this movie could be one of the greatest trailers of all time.
Unfortunately, the movie is one of the most mediocre. So much wasted potential. I'm a huge godzilla fan. You'd think naming a movie Godzilla, Godzilla would be a major character. He's barely I'm the movie.
There's a lot of good effects but all in all this movie is a big ol' letdown.",5,0,0,17 May 2020
