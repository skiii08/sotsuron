The Blair Witch Project," Frightening classic
","The Blair Witch Project (1999) C-87 min. D: Daniel Myrick, Eduardo SÃ¡nchez. Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, Michael C. Williams. Low-budget box-office smash about three film students doing a documentary on a witch legend (The Blair Witch) who eventually get lost in the woods and disappear. A year later, their footage is found and that's what we are watching in probably the most frightening movie in years. All of the dialogue was ad-libbed, making it even more realistic (if that is possible). The last ten minutes of the movie are the most terrifying of all. Don't watch it alone! RATING: 8 out of 10. Rated R for profanity.",8,0,1,26 October 1999
The Ring," Scary as hell
","The Ring (2002) D: Gore Verbinski. Naomi Watts, Martin Henderson, David Dorfman, Brian Cox, Jane Alexander, Lindsay Frost, Amber Tamblyn, Rachael Bella, Richard Lineback. Horror film based on the 1998 Japanese film RINGU is designed to shock, rock, and jolt its viewers, with the results being just plain scary as hell. Watts delivers a terrific performance as a news reporter who is investigating the origins of a freaky videotape whose viewers die 7 days after viewing it. The film borders on the absurd, but the atmosphere is unbearably tense. Loses 2 points, however, for the film's too many endings and an opening sequence that features teenagers that seemingly belong in a pop culture slasher film rather than this one. RATING: 8 out of 10. Rated PG-13 for violence and grisly images.",8,0,0,16 November 2002
Monster," Beautiful, sad masterpiece of film-making
","Monster (2003) C-109 min. D: Patty Jenkins. Charlize Theron, Christina Ricci, Bruce Dern, Lee Tergesen, Annie Corley, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Marco St. John, Marc Macaulay, Scott Wilson. Theron delivers perhaps the greatest performance by a lead actress ever, playing female prostitute/serial killer Aileen Wuornos, executed in 2002 for murdering seven men in 1989. Ricci also hits home as her lesbian lover Selby. The murders are gruesome and disturbing, especially the last murder that is extremely hard to watch, as Aileen murders a man who simply wants to help her. Highly recommended, though not for the squeamish (or close-minded). The film does a good job of not excusing Aileen's behavior, instead just serving as an explanation of how a human being could turn into someone so cold, heartless, and devoid of any redeemable qualities whatsoever. It's a beautiful, sad masterpiece of film-making. RATING: 9 out of 10. Rated R for violence, profanity, sexual situations, nudity.",9,0,0,23 August 2004
Happy Gilmore," Sandler is funny, but Stiller steals the show
","Happy Gilmore (1996) C-92 min. D: Dennis Dugan. Adam Sandler, Christopher McDonald, Julie Bowen, Frances Bay, Carl Weathers, Ben Stiller (cameo), Bob Barker. Very funny vehicle for bad boy Sandler, about a loser who strives to be a hockey player. When his grandma loses her home to the IRS, he joins the pro golf tour to make enough money to buy it back. While Sandler delivers a terrific performance (and is aided by excellent supporting actors McDonald and Weathers), the show-stealer is Ben Stiller, as an evil nursing home manager. Best scene: the 'landscaping duty' scene at the nursing home. RATING: 8 out of 10. Rated PG-13 for violence, strong language, and comic sexual themes.",8,1,1,31 December 1999
Final Destination 2," Excessively gory film with a truly sickening ending
","Final Destination 2 (2003) D: David R. Ellis. Ali Larter, A.J. Cook, Michael Landes, Terrence `T.C.' Carson, Jonathan Cherry, Keegan Connor Tracy, Sarah Carter, Tony Todd. Excessively gory film with a truly sickening ending is otherwise an entertaining and worthy sequel, although it is just a bloodier version of the original film. The sole survivor from FINAL DESTINATION (Larter) helps another group of teenagers in their quest to `cheat death' after the main character (Cook) has a premonition on a highway. Drags on towards the middle of the film, but will satisfy the fans of the original. Devon Sawa, star of the original, is sorely missed here. RATING: 5 out of 10. Rated R for graphic violence and profanity.",5,0,0,24 March 2003
The Bourne Identity," Nothing special
","The Bourne Identity (2002) D: Doug Liman. Matt Damon, Franka Potente, Chris Cooper, Clive Owen, Brian Cox, Julia Stiles, Gabriel Mann, Walt Goggins. Entertaining action farce has every action cliché imaginable, but a good performance by Damon makes it worthwhile. A man washes ashore, ridden with amnesia and bullet-holes, as he tries to piece his life back together and eventually gets involved in international espionage. Nothing special. RATING: 6 out of 10. Rated PG-13 for violence and profanity.",6,0,2,24 March 2003
The Italian Job," Overlong but enjoyable action film
","The Italian Job (2003) D: F. Gray Gray. Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Donald Sutherland, Jason Statham, Seth Green, Mos Def, Edward Norton. A team of expert thieves are double-crossed by one of their own and one year later, carry out the plan of ultimate payback. Overlong but enjoyable action film carried by its stars (Wahlberg, Theron, and Green stand out) and the good action sequences. For once, an action film that doesn't simply rely on computer-generated special effects! RATING: 7 out of 10. Rated PG-13 for violence and profanity.",7,1,2,21 July 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Action to spare, but lacks heart and Cameron's touch
","Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003) D: Jonathan Mostow. Arnold Schwarzeneggar, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes, Kristanna Loken, David Andrews, Earl Boen, Moira Harris, M.C. Gainey, Susan Merson. As it turns out, the 1997 nuclear war prevented in TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY had not been prevented at all, just merely postponed. Taking place in the present day, yet another Terminator, the T-X (Loken) is sent back through time to kill the future leader of the human resistance John Connor (Stahl, filling in for the troubled Edward Furlong), as well as several other future military leaders. The long awaited TERMINATOR sequel lacks director James Cameron and stars Linda Hamilton and Furlongand it shows. Despite some great action sequences by director Mostow (who won me over with 1997's BREAKDOWN) and great special effects, the film fails to capture its audience with awe and wonder like the first two. Several twists about the actual war caused by Skynet (talked about in the first two films but never actually shown) are present here and are a neat touch. However, Loken's T-X isn't nearly as menacing as Robert Patrick's T-1000 in T2. Action to spare, but lacks heart and Cameron's touch. Also, the music score by Marco Baltrami just plain sucks (omitting Brad Fiedel's famous TERMINATOR theme until a lousy orchestrated version at the film's end). RATING: 7 out of 10. Rated R for graphic violence, profanity, and brief nudity.",7,0,0,6 July 2003
American Beauty," Thought-provoking, realistic tale of a midlife crisis
","American Beauty (1999) D: Sam Mendes. Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari, Peter Gallagher, Allison Janney, Chris Cooper, Scott Bakula, Sam Robards. Thought-provoking, realistic tale of a midlife crisis. A first person account of one man's quest to turn his life around and how he turns everyone else's life into a living hell as a result. This film has everything: humor, drama, violence, and several plot twists. The acting, especially by Spacey, is superb and the twist ending is a nice added touch. Certainly not for all tastes, as the subject matter is less than squeaky clean. RATING: 9 out of 10. Rated R for strong sexual situations, profanity, violence, and drug use.",9,0,0,24 March 2003
54," Entertaining story about the famed 1970s New York nightclub
","54 (1998) D: Mark Christopher. Ryan Phillipe, Salma Hayek, Neve Campbell, Mike Myers, Sela Ward, Breckin Myer, Sherry Stringfield, Jay Goede. Uneven if entertaining story about the famed 1970s New York nightclub, as told through the eyes of a young bartender (Phillipe). The cinematography and set pieces are spectacular and the film really catches the look and feel of the late 1970s. Although Myers delivers a notable performance as the nightclub owner Steve Rubell, the film belongs to Phillipe, who has never looked hotter. Campbell has a disappointing lack of screen time. RATING: 7 out of 10. Rated R for violence, sexual situations, profanity, and drug use.",7,0,2,28 March 2003
The Butterfly Effect," Adult-themed BACK TO THE FUTURE
","The Butterfly Effect (2004) D: Eric Bress, J. Mackye Gruber. Ashton Kutcher, Amy Smart, Melora Waters, Elden Henson, William Lee Scott, Eric Stoltz, Lorena Gale. A young man who blacks out traumatic events in his life discovers a way to supernaturally alter his past, but eventually discovers that changing one minor detail completely screws things up. When he tries to change it, things get screwed up even more. A more adult-themed BACK TO THE FUTURE has some disturbing scenes (i.e. Stoltz's pedophile father character is reprehensible) and a good performance by Kutcher (who also executive-produced). Thankfully avoids the clichéd Hollywood shootouts, twist endings, and obligatory teen movie rock music soundtrack and concentrates instead on the story and performances, both of which far exceeded expectations. RATING: 8 out of 10. Rated R for violence, profanity, nudity, adult themes.",8,1,3,25 August 2004
Alien vs. Predator," Shame on the producers for wanting to please Hillary Duff fans
","Alien Vs. Predator (2004) C-101 min. D: Paul W.S. Anderson. Sanaa Lathan, Raoul Bova, Lance Henriksen, Ewen Bremner, Colin Salmon, Tommy Flanagan, Joseph Rye. Apparently, Sigourney Weaver was told of the idea of making this film and she said it `sounded awful.' Boy, was she ever right! One of the worst films of 2004 is so sloppily written and acted that it is a wonder I remained in the theater. The `plot' concerns some kind of archeological dig in Antarctica and step right into the middle of a war between the Aliens & Predators, blah blah blah blah. The studios' controversial decision to release this as PG-13 as opposed to R (since all of the other films from both series were rated R) translates into hardly any gore, lousy editing, and virtually incoherent fight sequences. Shame on the producers for wanting to please Hillary Duff fans as opposed to the real fans of both series, who were seriously robbed of a good film (unlike last year's far superior FREDDY VS. JASON). Awful! RATING: 1 out of 10. Rated PG-13 for violence, profanity, grisly images.",1,8,15,20 August 2004
Saving Private Ryan," Realistic, depressing drama
","Saving Private Ryan (1998) C-169 min. D: Steven Spielberg. Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Matt Damon, Edward Burns, Jeremy Davies, Ted Danson, Jake Busey. Realistic war drama begins at D-Day and continues through the story of an expedition to find the last of four brothers that have been killed in the war. Incredibly gory, but very true-to-life. Everyone involved delivers terrific performances, especially Hanks. RATING: 9 out of 10. Rated R for graphic violence, some language, and adult themes.",9,0,0,27 October 1999
28 Days Later...," It seemed like it took 28 days for the film to end
","28 Days Later(2002) D: Danny Boyle. Alex Palmer, Bindu De Stoppani, Jukka Hiltunen, David Schneider, Cillian Murphy, Toby Sedgwick, Naomie Harris. A deadly man-made `rage' virus has wiped out most of the planet. A handful of survivors have to save the rest of the human race from extinction. Much-hyped film that was quoted as `the scariest movie since THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT' isn't in the slightest bit terrifying and is at times mostly just plain boring. It seemed like it took 28 days for the film to end. And what the hell was up with that senseless ending?  RATING: 3 out of 10. Rated R for graphic violence, gore, full frontal nudity, and profanity.",3,0,1,21 July 2003
Mulholland Drive," Rarely does any picture make such an impact...
","Rarely does any picture make such an impact on the way people think and react to things than the 2001 film entitled Mulholland Drive, directed by David Lynch. Lynch has made a name for himself by creating dark and weird films that will pluck at one's nerves. Mulholland Drive is no exception and should be considered, in my opinion, as one of the best films in the history of cinema. Mulholland Drive is anchored by the incredible performance of Naomi Watts, who plays an up-and-coming actress who stumbles upon another woman who cannot remember who she is. This amnesic reaction is due to a fatal car accident on Mulholland Drive early that evening. We are also introduced to several supporting characters and countless subplots. The movie plays out like a dream world, with several scenes having little or nothing to do with the `plot.' Without getting into too much detail and giving the secrets away, the film is about 3/4ths over when it takes a complete 360ยบ turn. The plot, its characters, and the situations seem to completely change and as I was watching the remainder of Mulholland Drive, I was wondering why Lynch was playing with my mind this way. Eventually, I got frustrated and looked up some key plot points on the Internet and eventually, everything became clear. I watched Mulholland Drive a second time and realized how much sense this seemingly incomprehensible film actually made. Lynch is a complete genius for being able to toy with the minds of countless viewers, only to laugh in their face and say `I can't believe you were this stupid not to figure this film out.' Mulholland Drive does something most films don't: plays with your mind and leaves you with a blank stare, wondering how you could let a film pluck at your nerves.",9,1,2,26 October 2002
8 Mile," Slow-moving, but effective
","8 Mile (2002) D: Curtis Hanson. Eminem, Kim Basinger, Brittany Murphy, Mekhi Phifer, Eugene Byrd, Omar Benson Miller, Taryn Manning. A semi-autobiography of Eminem's humble beginnings. He plays Jimmy Smith, Jr., a struggling Detroit rapper who dreams big but doesn't have much, except his friends and his music. Eminem's screen debut is a success, with the Grammy rapper delivering a terrific performance. Slow-moving tale, but effective, except an unsatisfying ending and the seemingly useless Alex character (played by Brittany Murphy). The rap soundtrack definitely is a plus. RATING: 8 out of 10. Rated R for violence, drug use, sexuality, and strong language.",8,0,0,24 November 2002
From Dusk Till Dawn," Gory, humorous thriller with the biggest second half 360 since Mulholland Drive
","From Dusk Til Dawn (1996) D: Robert Rodriguez. Harvey Keitel, George Clooney, Quentin Tarantino, Juliette Lewis, Salma Hayek, Cheech Marin, Tom Savini, Fred Williamson, Kelly Preston, Ernest Liu. Gory, humorous thriller with the biggest second half 360 since MULHOLLAND DRIVE. Two brother criminals take a family hostage over the border into Mexico and have one more night until freedom. That is, until they visit a bar inhabited by bloodthirsty vampires! Clooney and Tarantino really stand out as the criminal brothers. The special effects are bloody and at times cheesy, but it's all in good fun. RATING: 8 out of 10. Rated R for graphic violence and gore, profanity, and nudity.",8,5,7,24 March 2003
Saw," Throws in every single genre cliché imaginable
","Saw (2004) C-100 min. D: James Wan. Leigh Whannel, Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, Ken Leung, Dina Meyer, Mike Butters, Michael Emerson, Monica Potter, Ned Bellamy. The millionth serial killer movie since SILENCE OF THE LAMBS throws in every single genre cliché imaginable (how many times are the main character's wife and daughter going to be threatened in a movie like this?) not to mention surprisingly bad acting (except Glover) and an twist that is obvious from the opening minute. A doctor and a photographer are chained to pipes on opposite ends of a filthy torture chamber, victims of the Jigsaw, a serial killer who plays games in order for his victims to kill each other. Of course, the doctor's family has been taken hostage and time is of the essence. More gruesome than scary, with the all-too-familiar Hollywood shootout climax (isn't this supposed to be an independent film?) but there are some tense moments here and there. RATING: 5 out of 10. Rated R for graphic violence & gore, grisly images, and profanity.",8,0,0,22 November 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," Doesn't live up to its hype
","The Matrix Reloaded (2003) D: Andy Wachowski, Larry Wachowski. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, Jada Pinkett Smith, Gloria Foster, Nona M. Gaye, Monica Belluci. Long-awaited special effects extravaganza sequel to THE MATRIX doesn't live up to its hype. Neo (Reeves) has to stop Zion from being destroyed within 72 hours and save Trinity (Moss) from a grueling demise in his dreams. Fishburne gives a classic example of overacting during his preaching scene in the beginning and Moss looks about 15 years older than the first film, even though this began shooting in 2001. The much-hyped special effects will disappoint some (especially during the car chase when it's obvious that the actors are fighting in front of a bluescreen), the film is virtually incomprehensible if you haven't seen the first film, and it's way too long. NOTE: Aaliyah was supposed to play the character of Zee before she was killed in a plane crash August of 2001. Foster, who plays the Oracle, died in September 2001 after completing a majority of her scenes for this film. However, she did not film any of her scenes for THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS, the concluding chapter in this series coming November 2003. ANOTHER NOTE: I am not a fan of THE MATRIX, so it was hard for me to like this film, but it was still entertaining enough to get a mediocre rating. RATING: 5 out of 10. Rated R for graphic violence, profanity, and sexual situations.",5,0,0,26 May 2003
Halloween," Fantastic
","Halloween (1978) C-90 min. D: John Carpenter.  Donald Pleasence, Jamie Lee Curtis, Nancy Loomis, PJ Soles, Charles Cyphers, Kyle Richards, Brian Andrews, Nick Castle. Absolutely awesome low-budget horror film that set the standard for slasher films. This suspenseful and chilling masterpiece centers around the story of a psychotic madman named Michael Myers who brutally murders his sister on Halloween night as a child and then escapes from a mental institute 15 years later, coming back to his hometown on Halloween to terrorize teenagers. Pleasance is incredible as Dr. Loomis, Michael Myers' doctor who is determined to capture Myers as soon as possible. Curtis is terrific as Laurie Strode, Myers' main target (you'll find out why in HALLOWEEN II) and Loomis isn't that bad herself as Curtis' friend Annie. The atmosphere is so scary, the music is so eerie, and the finale is so frightening! This film is worth every minute of it! RATING: 10 out of 10. Rated R for some language, nudity, violence, and sexuality.",10,0,0,27 October 1999
The Silence of the Lambs," Disturbing, to say the least
","Silence of the Lambs (1991) C-118 min. D: Jonathan Demme. Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn, Ted Levine, Anthony Heald. Suspenseful detective yarn about an FBI trainee whose only way to track down a notorious serial killer is to ask for help from another one, the infamous Hannibal `The Cannibal' Lectar. Pretty good mystery/thriller has some disgusting subject matter (even for the TV version, which is what I viewed) but hits home in a bravura finale. RATING: 7 out of 10. Rated R for graphic violence and gore, strong language, adult themes, and disturbing subject matter.",9,1,1,26 October 1999
The Silence of the Lambs," One of the scariest films ever made
","The Silence of the Lambs (1991) D: Jonathan Demme. Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn, Ted Levine, Anthony Heald, Frankie Faison, Kasi Lemmons, Brooke Smith, Paul Lazar, Ron Vawter. One of the scariest films ever made, the story of rookie FBI agent Clarice Starling (Foster), who seeks the help of the imprisioned serial killer `Hannibal the Cannibal,' Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins), to help catch an active serial killer called `Buffalo Bill' (Levine). The performances are probably the best ever in a motion picture, especially by Foster and Hopkins. The final 20 minutes contain probably the most unbearably tense scenes ever filmed. Followed by 2001's HANNIBAL and 2002's prequel RED DRAGON. RATING: 9 out of 10. Rated R for graphic violence and torture, grisly images, strong language, and nudity.",9,0,0,8 October 2002
Bruce Almighty," Nice to see Carrey back in his old mid-90s form
","Bruce Almighty (2003) D: Tom Shadyac. Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Aniston, Philip Baker Hall, Catherine Bell, Lisa Ann Walter, Steven Carell, Nora Dunn, Eddie Jemison, Paul Satterfield. A discouraged TV reporter who is fed up by God's wrathful hand is given God's powers by the Almighty himself (played by Freeman, who plays God as accurately as one could possibly portray Him) to show how hard it is to run the world. The gags range from funny to downright hilarious, but the movie becomes sentimental and campy towards the end. It's nice to see Carrey back in his old mid-90s form. RATING: 7 out of 10. Rated PG-13 for slapstick violence, profanity, and sexual innuendoes.",7,0,1,21 July 2003
Identity," Suspense of the Hitchcock Mold
","Identity (2003) D: James Mangold. John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, John Hawkes, Alfred Molina, Clea DuVall, John C. McGinley, William Lee Scott, Jake Busey, Pruitt Taylor Vince.  Suspense of the Hitchcock mold fills this terrific horror mystery/thriller about a wide variety of individuals who become trapped at a creepy motel (one that Norman Bates himself would have avoided) during a severe thunderstorm. Fate seems to have brought them there for a specific purpose, and when they all start to be killed off one by one, the mystery awaits them: why are they even there in the first place? Dark film with twists every few minutes or so, it never lets up and surprises you at the end with one last unexpected twist. Cusack is terrific. RATING: 8 out of 10. Rated R for graphic violence, grisly images, and profanity.",8,0,1,12 May 2003
X2: X-Men United," Bigger-budgeted, more action-packed sequel than its predecessor
","X2: X-Men United (2003) D: Bryan Singer. Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Brian Cox, Alan Cumming, Bruce Davison, Shawn Ashmore, Kelly Hu. Bigger-budgeted, more action-packed sequel than its predecessor. This time around, the X-Men band together to fight against an evil anti-mutant politician (Cox) and the U.S. government (interesting time to release a movie that portrays our government negatively). Great performances throughout, louder special effects, and exciting action sequences; however, the film is too long. RATING: 7 out of 10.
