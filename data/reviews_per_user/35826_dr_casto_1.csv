The Blair Witch Project," Great little film wasted on general public.
","I really loved this film, but felt like someone had cast pearls before the swine when I saw this at my local cineplex. It was very distracting to have to put up with traditional horror movie fans' rude behavior during the showing I attended. Please, if you don't like documentary style films, or if you have to be bombarded with special effects and gore to have a good time at the movies; do everyone a favor and stay home! This is a nice little intimate film that will crawl up your spine and into your head if you let it. In between the times I was yelling at people to shut up, I was genuinely spooked by this movie. I think all of the hype about the film has drawn in a lot of viewers who are expecting something else. This movie doesn't force itself upon you, it will only scare you if a allow it to. This apparently takes more concentration than general audiences have. Rent this when it comes out on tape and enjoy.",9,1,1,30 July 1999
