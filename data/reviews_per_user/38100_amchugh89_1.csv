The New World," Boring art film
","Another review (by Stelea) put this best: 'Its like watching a 10hr Calvin Klein or Tommy advert, i kept expecting them to whisper 'eternity by Calvin Klein'This movie is BORING and BAD - you are not a Philistine for thinking so....and i guess i have to have ten lines of text to submit a review. so here are some beautifully shot movies that are actually good: Jiro Dreams of Sushi, Y Tu Mama Tambien , Skyfall , Black Swan , Any Batman , There Will Be Blood , City of God, The Thin Red Line and many many more",4,0,0,3 January 2013
