The Devil's Advocate," A beguiling experience
","This is one of the most intensely dark and beguiling movies I have seen. The purpose behind it is to create a moral drama about the fight between good and evil in a man, or the devil's everlasting quest to conquer man's soul. In retrospective, there are few movies I've seen that bring out such strong feelings in me. Specially the first hour. We follow a young couple, played by Reeves and Theron in her first big picture, who move to New York from the south when he is given a job as attorney in one of the biggest firms in the country. We see the change come in Kevin as he is introduced to a world of luxury and pleasure by his boss, THE DEVIL, played by old master Al Pacino.The ending brings a new, unpredictable and great twist to the story. I will not give it away. The supporting cast is pretty strong, specially Jeffrey Jones who plays a senior partner in Lucifer Pacino's firm and who first arises the suspicion in Kevin/Keanu with his mysterious behaviour, and Connie Nielsen as Cristabella, an extremely hot Italian colleague who is the very symbol of temptation. Nielsen looked even better here than in 'Gladiator' and her performance is also more interesting. Charlize Theron displayed her range here for the first time, showing she had a great potential to become a star with her mix of ethereal beauty and acting talent. Reeves was also very good as the hotshot attorney and his looks elevated his macho hero potential. Al Pacino didn't disappoint, but his performance here counts as one of his least spectacular.This is a dark movie with elements of horror and some gore and sex thrown in for good measure. I think Taylor Hackford never did it better. He gave us something to ponder on while entertaining and scaring us at the same time. It is a film one can't forget.9/10",9,89,105,1 April 2005
Scarface," De Palma's finest work
","SCARFACE is definitely Brian De Palma's best film and the only one that isn't flawed or too violent and disturbing. It follows the story of a Cuban refugee in Florida who eventually becomes a major drug lord through connections with a powerful Columbian cartel boss. His best friend is Manny, played by Steven Bauer in his best performance yet, who is the more humorous of the two and is the only man Tony can always rely on. More strong supporting roles by Loggia as Montana's old boss, Michelle Pfeiffer as his love interest, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as his sister whom he is sickly protective of and a fine cameo by F. Murray Abraham as his ill-fated partner who gets whacked in a memorable scene.De Palma balances humor, violence, love and drama very well in this film. Nearly all the characters are fascinating and well created, like in his second best film 'Carlito's Way', and the dramatic intensity remains as strong throughout the movie. From the rebuking by his mother through his difficult relationship with Elvira and finally the ultimate tragic ending, this movie is not an easygoing affair. Yet its suspenseful twists and interesting characters make you sit all the way through it's 170 minutes and the ending leaves you emotionally shaken. There is a lot to pity in Tony and his dark and violent end. Al Pacino turns in a simply breathtaking performance which is one of the strongest points of this film and the very reason why you can't get your eyes off the screen. He gives his character a unique emotional weight and strength.This is indeed a work which belongs up there with all the best.10 out of 10.",10,15,25,25 March 2005
Amistad," Disappointing and overrated
","This is a typical example of Spielberg's failed attempt at making a classic.Another good example is 'Saving Private Ryan'.Where this film falls short is when it tries to get deeper and give a wider emotional picture of the racial issue.Too much talking and too many unnecessary scenes spoil this attempt.In the end,it almost feels like watching a documentary,just like 'Saving Private Ryan'.Both Freeman and Skarsgård are surprisingly wooden here and fail to impress,yes even to deliver palpable performances.That is because their characters are left standing behind much of the time and serve mostly as bystanders who watch and comment,but never make an impact on the happenings.The only pluses are Hopkins and Hounsou,who carry the film along with a little help from McConaughey.This picture got a good reception from many critics,yet I don't see why.It may look and feel like a great movie at first,but soon after it drops down to average and surprisingly boring for such a riveting and engaging story.The only scenes really worth watching are the ones with Anthony Hopkins,specially the final trial scene.The ending doesn't do much but add an epilogue to the story.This movie could have been much better.In my eyes,Spielberg was the wrong director for this project.Frank Darabont or Ridley Scott would have been better choices.Still,the film gives a good insight in the history of slave trade and America's socio-political situation in that time. Yet still, this film is far from a classic it could have been.6 1/5",6,2,5,20 October 2004
Seven Years in Tibet," Spirit versus oppression
","The first time I watched this movie, I didn't pay much attention, so I didn't pick up the most important details. Second time I was drawn in and then I could really enjoy this movie. 'Seven years in Tibet' follows the story of an Austrian alpine star and his life in Tibet. His encounter with Tibet, its culture and people is highlighted very well by the excellent director Annaud and the scenery is incredible.Brad Pitt excels in one of his first solid roles and makes this a worthwhile experience along with David Thewlis, B.D. Wong, Mako, the beautiful Lhakpa Tsamchoe and the young actor playing Dalai Lama. There is humor, drama and tensions here as well as tragedy and political intrigues. Wong is especially effective as the treacherous Ngawang Jigme, the man who becomes the main responsible for his country's fall. This subplot is the most interesting in the film and shows us how traitors have existed and will exist anywhere in the world, even in such a religious and 'pure' country as Tibet.All in all, it's a very strong experience and enriching one also. Here we see the everlasting battle of the spirit against oppression, but in contrast to other such movies, this one has a more pessimistic ending. Oppression triumphs. This is clearly one of the most important movies of the last decade.",9,6,10,27 November 2005
Constantine," Solid and entertaining, but cliché ridden
","I went to see this movie last Sunday and my expectations were not too high, so I got what I expected, perhaps even more. 'Constantine' is another Keanu Reeves fantasy vehicle, but this time it's about demons and angels and not a parallel world aka The Matrix. It's hard to judge Reeves' acting as it shifts from poor and uninspired to solid and credible all the time. Perhaps the scriptwriter or the director are to blame. The direction really could have been better. The effects are on par with what one can expect from a big blockbuster flick, yet they tend to get overwhelming and exhausting.Rachel Weisz is undoubtedly the film's strongest point and her performance is excellent and as good as it can be in such a film. Her character is also among the few well-crafted ones in the movie. Djimon Hounsou doesn't make much impact this time and Peter Stormare's cameo as Lucifer is...well, entertaining. Although one can wonder what he's doing in this movie. Tilda Swinton's bizarre incarnation as Gabriel is just weird, hard to comprehend. I'm against all this 'womanising' of archangels, it's so absurd and cliché-ish, typical product of the 21st century culture. Like 'why can't a woman play Gabriel?' Well...because Gabriel was a male, not some androgynous creature.The biggest downside with this flick is the inexhaustive arsenal of bad jokes and typical Hollywood clichés which never seem to cease. Constantine's finger to Lucifer in the climax of the film is perhaps the only joke that is tasteful. The exorcism scene in the beginning was very intense and is among the better parts of the movie. All said, this is probably as good as a movie based on a comic can get, so I think it deserves a 6.",6,42,83,2 March 2005
Duck You Sucker," Leone's most profound work
","Even compared to his most stunning classics like 'The Good,The Bad and The Ugly','Once Upon a Time in the West' and 'For a Few Dollars more',this film comes off like Leone's most mature and profound work. The theme is revolution.Parallels are drawn between Ireland and Mexico,two countries in violent uprising at the time.These parallels show that revolution is revolution,pretty much the same everywhere you go.It takes its casualties and destroys the lives of its survivors.James Coburn does his best performance ever in what I see as Leone's attempt to toy with the image of his stereotypical hero like Man With No Name.Coburn's Sean Mallory is Man With No Name caught in the grip of reality,as much as Steiger's Juan Miranda is Tuco shown in the same light.All actors do a great job and Domingo Antoine is chillingly effective as the monstrous half-German colonel Ruiz,riding a tank which makes him synonymous with the Nazi Germany and SS,adding more menace to the overall demonic image.Romolo Valli is also great as the leftist doctor who is the brain behind the revolutionary force in a small town where Juan and Sean plan to strike,both from different reasons. His betrayal of his comrades is the greatest shock in the film.The flashbacks are among the most meaningful I have seen in a film and complement the story very well.As Mallory reaches into his difficult past,we first start to gain sympathy for him.The action scenes are overwhelming and exhaustive.The climax adds to the flow of strong emotions throughout the film as it is very dramatic.Steiger's justified and merciless revenge on the evil colonel gives compensation for Mallory's death and is maybe the most violent killing scene ever in western cinema,even beating 'Bonnie and Clyde'.Still,in the end,one cannot help but feel despair and pity as Juan is left on his own to ponder about it all and reflect on his own fate.Here Steiger really shows his greatness and is along with Coburn unjustly snubbed for a major award.All said,this film still has enough comedy,fun and light moments to bring you joy.I strongly recommend this picture to lovers of true western and fans of Coburn and Steiger.From here,Leone strayed into obscurity with his gangster epic 'Once Upon a Time in America',making this his final swan song.10/10.",10,61,77,25 September 2004
Legends of the Fall," A beautiful film
","This is one of the films that I enjoy watching the most.There is so much to enjoy.The performances,the atmosphere,wonderful scenery and the epic feel of it all.Tristan Ludlow is one of the best romantic heroes of the 90's cinema.Julia Ormond was wonderful and breathed more beauty and charm into the screen.Brad Pitt is seen here in one of his best early performances and he really does an impressive work.Aidan Quinn was also great as his rivalising older brother who is in envy of his love affair and marriage with Julia and turns into a capitalist,leaving his family ranch and his old ideals behind for a comfortable and profitable life as a railroad company executive in town.This also shows the old nature/civilization conflict,wherein Tristan,his father and One Stab represent the unspoiled and natural side,while Tristan's brother Alfred and the crooked O'Banion brothers represent the corrupt industrial side,which leads to an inevitable clash resulting in a tragedy for Tristan and a final showdown with the O'Banion's.In the meanwhile,Alfred has realized he was on the wrong side and makes peace with his brother.There is also another angle added to the story,the first world war.Here we see the idealistic spirit of the ill-fated youngest brother Samuel,the martyr character of the film.Samuel chooses to fight for what he believes in and his brothers follow him,uncertain if they are making a wise choice but reluctant to let their little brother fight on his own.It is this addition that gives this film an epic quality.As Tristan falls into a fit of berserker madness after Samuel's death and goes on a killing rampage against the Germans,there is a feeling that something has been lost in him and that a part of him had died,which will later create great complications for him when he tries to build a new life with Susannah.Not just that,but the bear in him has truly awoken and will not be silenced easily.This could have hardly been better.Anthony Hopkins and Gordon Tootoosis make a great supporting cast,Tootoosis' narration enhancing the epic effect further and giving it a wonderful,mythic touch.After all this,what more can you ask for?This is a clear winner.8/10",8,1,3,29 September 2004
The Last Emperor," Moving and spectacular
","The Last Emperor is a rare achievement with lavish historical films in it that is compelling as well as moving, along with being spectacular. It captures with grace those last days of the Chinese empire and all its glory and terror. John Lone stars as the adult Pu Yi, a man of tragic fate but of noble principles. Lone shines in his part, as well as other actors like Joan Chen and Peter O'Toole, who plays the young Pu Yi's mentor.This visually splendid film can however prove exhausting, especially in its uncut version. But for all the negative criticism it has got, it never gets dull. Bertolucci has never done a movie like this before or after. The closest he got to it was with 'Little Buddha', a movie not as good as this one. What else is there to say about it? It serves both as a history lesson for those who know little or nothing about the Chinese history before Mao and a feast for the eye. It is a lesson that can not be taken for granted. A story about a man who wanted to build a paradise, but ended in hell instead. I think the value of this film is everlasting. It is not perfect, but as close to it as a great historical epic can be.",9,1,2,3 October 2006
The Adjustment Bureau," Candidate for movie of the year
","The Adjustment Bureau is a breath of fresh air for me. Watching it was quite a different experience then watching usual today's movies. It works well both as a melodrama and as a pro sci-fi complex drama. Damon and Blunt are both very good in their roles and good old Terence Stamp delivers another pretty memorable role.The Adjustment Bureau are a sort of guardian angels of this world, except they are not really angels but more like otherworldly beings that direct and shape everything that's going on in the world. They decide a man's destiny, at least destiny of important men. And women. David Norris is one of these men and he is an ambitious but depressed young politician who is looking to find himself again after getting lost in the maze of his political career after 8 years. He's also still coping with the loss of his parents and brother. A chance meeting with Elise, a beautiful and spirited ballet dancer, makes his dream come true. He feels something again. But the Bureau will not allow this to happen to him, in order to make him continue with his career. And her with hers.This film is about love, love that can't be destroyed. Elise is the only thing that is not programmed in David's life, the only thing that really makes his life worth living. And no matter what steps the Bureau make to prevent them from meeting again, they always do. Because they are bound together, meant to be. This film really touched something in me and I think everybody feels something when they watch it, they feel hope and they feel what love is about. Love can sometimes be the only escape out of a difficult and painful situation in life and it can guide us back into light.Wonderful film with 2 very important talents Hollywood has today. Emily Blunt shows again why her career has taken off like it has. She has charm, delicate beauty, talent and above all believability. She's 100% authentic in her part and so is Damon. Terence Stamp is perfect in his role that represents FATE, the one we try to get away from. At least in this movie we succeed.",9,0,1,25 July 2011
The Last Samurai," East meets West...and the East wins!
","This is something I've been waiting for for so long. To see a movie about Japanese culture and samurai tradition succeed in the West. Of course, the only way it could have been done was if it was made by the Americans. And I must say that Edward Zwick and the rest have done an admirable job. This movie is done in an authentic Japanese style and only thing that stands out as un-Japanese is Tom Cruise.The movie is set in the late 19th century and talks about the so-called Meiji-restoration, a special chapter in Japan's history when Japan was made a modern state, partly modeled on Western countries. The error is that Meiji is supposedly impressed with USA and wants to create an army which is modeled on theirs. That was not the case because Americans never trained their army but the Prussians and it's more likely that Meiji and his government were closer connected to them than USA, as it was later shown in Japan's history when they allied themselves with Hitler's Germany. And it is not unlikely because the two countries share many similarities in the way their society and state is modeled.But lets return to the movie itself. Ken Watanabe caught the eye of Hollywood here for the first time and deservedly so, for his performance is impressive at every turn and same can be said about his screen presence. Another pleasant surprise to me was Koyuki, the young Japanese actress who brings her breathtaking beauty and charisma into the film, like a breathe of fresh air in a movie elsewhere dominated by stern and grim-looking men. Hiroyuki Sanada is a pleasure to watch as always, although he gets too little screen time. His fencing scenes with Cruise are a joy to watch and both actors do a great job there. Shin Koyamada is also a pleasant surprise as Katsumoto's son who dies a heroic death ensuring the escape of his father and his warriors in a well shot scene. The ninja attack and the final battle are incredibly well choreographed and shot. Tom Cruise is credible as Algren and although his less-than-imposing presence makes it hard to picture him as a swashbuckling macho hero, he still serves his purpose.'The Last Samurai' is one of the most positive happenings in the 21st century Hollywood. It recreated a lost culture, a culture that was as admirable as it was cruel and stern. The cherry tree scene is among the most expressive and beautiful I have seen in an American film. Ken Watanabe's Oscar worthy performance, the beauty and charisma of Koyuki and the sweeping landscapes and battle scenes are more than enough to bring you pleasure. 8/10",8,1,2,19 February 2005
Mystic River," Clint's greatest work
","This movie is the ultimate proof of mr. Eastwood's directorial skill and a career highlight for Sean Penn, who gives one of his three best performances here. Clint's impeccable style includes some marvellous touches such as the quiet, but ever-present sound of wind which adds to the chilling and eerily suspenseful atmosphere and several helicopter shots (his trademark) of the Mystic River at night. The overall mood is so darkly captivating and it really draws you in. The first scene is perhaps the most impressive one.Tim Robbins plays yet another disturbed and rather frightening character as Dave, the man with a dark and troubled past who ultimately turns out to be the greatest victim. Marcia Gay Harden is excellent as his supportive wife and Laura Linney equally effective as her opposite, the surprisingly cold wife of Jimmy Markum (Penn). Eli Wallach, always a delight to watch, makes a thrilling cameo as mr. Loony the shop owner.What else is there to say? An immortal classic and the crowning achievement of one of the greatest actor/directors. A clear 10.",10,2,4,29 April 2005
The Mission," Poignant and touching
","This is a movie that will always stay in my memory.First time I saw it, back in the late 80's,I thought it was too brutal and even morbid in a way.But the second and third time I was swept off by its non-conformistic beauty.The story begins unusually,with De Niro's character killing his own brother over a woman.The good priest in Irons' interpretation steps in as guiding light and leads him to salvation,which means that he takes him to his own Mission deep in the jungles.There De Niro is born again as an individual,though he doesn't lose his warrior instincts and I believe much of his story revolves around dealing with his newfound identity as a Christian and struggle to shake his old militant ways.The film gives us some strong performances and both De Niro and Irons should be praised for they pull it off wonderfully in their parts.I believe this to be De Niro's last great performance.The movie is beautifully shot,a Roland Joffe trademark,and though it ends tragically it isn't a sad film.Its poignant and highly enlightening and I believe many souls were deeply changed after seeing it.The Morricone score is brilliant as always.A nice supporting cast includes Liam Neeson and Aidan Quinn in some of their best early work. Another strong part comes from Ray McAnally in the ambiguous part of Cardinal Altamirano. Its a landmark film all in all and deserves a 9 out of 10.",9,15,19,7 January 2004
Platoon," An important work
","'Platoon' was my first introduction to wartime reality.I was just a kid when first viewing it and the film left a powerful impression in me.Before that,I had only seen a couple of Rambo films and thats what I expected to get here,pretty much.It turned out to be something quite different from that,although it would take me a few years to realize just how different.'Platoon' is Oliver Stone's breakthrough picture and a landmark in Hollywood history of the 80's.It features almost every well known actor on the rise from that era,most notable ones being Forest Whitaker,Johnny Depp,Willem Dafoe,Francesco Quinn and Charlie Sheen.Why is it a landmark film?It helped to bring more understanding into the hot issue of Vietnam war,although 'Apocalypse Now!' had already worked out that subject in the most stunning way.Yet there was still something left to say for Stone.It was pretty much the same as Coppola said,but in another,more harrowing and less complex way.We got a closer glimpse of how it is to die,for one.Dafoe's heroic end is one of the most dramatic scenes in history of war films.A strong issue here is the abuse of military codes and discipline.Tom Berenger's sadistic,disturbed sgt. Barnes is the perfect example of a warrior playing god,or angel of death, and fighting a war by his own rules.Berenger plays Barnes so well that it really gives you the chills watching him and you want him dead.Sgt. Elias is his counterpart in every way,as he really cares for his men and is in touch with the human in him always.He is not popular among the lowlifes like the redneck psychopath Bunny (great early role by Kevin Dillon) and the spineless racist O'Neill in John McGinley's incarnation.Another spineless character is the young lieutenant,who on one hand is a greater sinner than Barnes.He has no control over the men under his command whatsoever and refuses to take responsibility or even feel the guilt for not doing anything to prevent the massacre of the village committed by Barnes and his butchers.Here we see the effect that the horrors are having on private Chris,as he in a fit of frustration and anger over the situation he is in tortures a sick and frail creature of a man and ends up in tears.Its a powerful and riveting scene which highlights the film's message against war,showing its inhumanity and absurdity in the most shocking way.The final battle is very brutal and well shot.It sums up the whole Vietnam war and the strategy of the American army.The napalm kills not just the Vietcongs but also Americans.Ironically,it saves Chris' life as he is about to be killed by Barnes during their confrontation.Bunny gets what he deserves and Junior,who is the most despicable of the black characters here,also dies.This may be seen as director's own judgment.The only other sympathetic character still alive by this time,the underground lord Rah, is left alive.Francesco Quinn shows here that he is capable of taking over his father's legacy.In the end,this film is not flawless,but it is a perfect document of the madness that occurred in Vietnam 1964-73.And its consistent to its very end,which by the way is very touching and almost made me cry the second time I watched it.It is funny how one can feel both happy and sad about leaving a war torn place.Such are the feelings that a war conjures up in a man.It is almost like Chris was sad he was leaving,or maybe the emotions that were bubbling under surface just came out for real.Any which way,this film will always be remembered as the one that gave a true and unpolished picture of mankind at war at a time when Hollywood producers made an attempt to glorify the US army and cast an eclipse on its disgraceful stain,transforming the killing into culture.Ironically they succeeded.8/10",8,31,45,27 September 2004
Kagemusha," A great film that grows on you
","'Kagemusha' is one of those films which wasn't intended as a great success, yet it became that, winning the Golden Palm and giving Kurosawa back his much needed acclaim in Japan and re-establishing his reputation as the giant of Asian cinema. Although Kurosawa himself thought of this film as a mere dress rehearsal,a preparation for 'Ran', 'Kagemusha' carries its own distinctive essence which makes it a work in the same category as its successor.The story deals around one of the greatest feudal lords and generals in Japan's history, Takeda Shingen, showing his unexpected and untimely demise. Although Shingen is the most powerful figure here, he is used as a monument around which everything revolves and not as the principal hero.This film is full of sad and tragic moments, starting with Shingen's untimely death and culminating with the rebuking of his impersonator, Kagemusha. Nakadai plays the dual roles wonderfully. He is so emotionally involved in his part as Kagemusha that it seems almost uncanny. Thus we see why Kurosawa has chosen him as Mifune's successor. The other actors are also splendid and specially young Daisuke Ryu makes a startling appearance as Shingen's arch rival Oda Nobunaga.The ending is very hard to watch, both the scene where Kagemusha is thrown out in the rain and the last scene which illustrates the death of the Takeda clan. What makes this film a pleasure to watch is the incredible cinematography and photography, specially in the incredible dream sequence where the ghost of Shingen chases Kagemusha through red clouds, as well as the hauntingly beautiful music and marvelous performances.All in all, this is a great film that will grow on you the more you watch it. Although 'Ran' is more spectacular and gripping, 'Kagemusha' is more compelling because of its epic nature. 9/10",9,54,60,8 October 2004
The Thin Red Line," Poetic and painful
","Films like this shouldn't be taken for granted.And Iam afraid too many have done that already.But that just can't be helped in today's shallow and superficial world of cinema.Terrence Malick's third and comeback picture is a masterpiece in itself.It contains some of the most poetic and poignant scenes ever seen in the history of cinema.The performances are all equally good,specially Penn,Caviezel,Chaplin,Koteas and Brody's.This movie served as a springboard for James Caviezel and it fully displays what he is capable of as actor.His scenes are very emotional and expressionistic,like Richard Burton himself or even Brando came back to do their best.I won't waste too many lines on describing this movie.It is best to try and experience it on your own and then look for answers and try to understand it fully.I haven't yet managed to do the last bit.It only shows the genius and brilliance of Malick's films.I have seen 'Badlands' recently and there I found the same haunting and beautiful expression,complemented with the incredible landscape.The landscapes add tremendously lot to the artistic feel of the film.Specially the scene where the soldiers march through the fields where nothing but an overwhelming silence meets them.Just that moment expressed the whole feeling of being in a war.The fear is very monumental both in this film and 'Badlands'.Fear of not making it and the struggle for survival are ever-present.The film also shows the ambiguous face of the war and men who stand behind it,generals and commanders.Captain James 'Bugger' Staros in Elias Koteas' incarnation portrays a typical disillusioned under-officer who has to take orders and carry them out no matter how unreasonable they sound.It all becomes too much for him and he bails out,losing some respect from the men in his command along the way,notably from Sgt.Welsh(Penn).John Cusack portrays the heroic and young Captain Gaff who,after carrying out his orders successfully and is deemed a hero by Colonel Tall(Nolte),realizes just what kind of man his superior officer is.He is the idealist as opposed to Staros' disillusioned and more experienced character.This is also another great angle that the film offers.Its only a shame Cusack didn't have more screen time,but thats a common sickness and in my opinion the only possible downside here.As I said,wonderful acting,wonderful landscapes and photography,music couldn't be better(Hans Zimmer never fails) and the poignant message altogether-make this a truly majestic work.This film deserves a 10 from me.",10,3,6,23 May 2004
Goodfellas," Simply great
","What is the formula behind making the perfect gangster movie? It has to be long, short gangster movies seldom work. There has to be a wide variety of characters, movies like 'The Hoodlum' were dull because there were only a few main characters there. Here even the minor characters are well developed, enough to catch your eye. And last, it has to show some violence but in moderate quantities. There is some violence here, most notably in the 'Billy Batts scene', but it never overflows, 'Casino' had far more violent scenes than this film. If there is no violence whatsoever, then the movie can't be an effective gangster/mafia movie.But what is perhaps most appealing with this film is that, in contrast to movies like The Godfather trilogy, Scarface and Casino, this movie is based 100% on real events and characters. Only a few names are altered, the rest is all authentic.Robert De Niro again delivers, even though I think he has been somewhat miscast as Jimmy (Burke) Conway. Jimmy the Gent was Irish-American and even though DeNiro is part Irish himself, he doesn't look like a typical Irish-American. Burke was also a tall and imposing man, unlike DeNiro and he always chomped on a cigar. Doesn't help that DeNiro also has that unmistakable Italian-American drawl: 'Wats da madda wit u?'Pesci is just incredible and a delight to watch, despite playing a very unsympathetic character. Liotta fits his part perfectly as well and what I liked here is that they show his corruption by the mob world that embraced him in the beginning. If he had been shown as just some innocent naive sweet guy, it wouldn't look authentic, would it? Several scenes have since become classics, deservedly so. The 'Shinebox scene' aka Billy Batts scene is perhaps the most unforgettable, but also the 'Funny Guy scene'. Elizabeth Bracco, even though not my favorite actress, offers a strong supporting role as mrs. Henry Hill, the headstrong and hot tempered Karen. Paul Sorvino is also marvelous in his somewhat restricted but pivotal part as Henry's close friend and first mentor Paulie Cicero. Frank Sivero from 'Godfather II' is a welcome sight and his character is like a counterpart to Pesci's, a silent and unintentionally humorous sidekick.Scorsese scored big with this big screen adaptation of one of the most intriguing real-life mafia stories. This remains one of his crowning achievements.",10,0,0,4 November 2011
