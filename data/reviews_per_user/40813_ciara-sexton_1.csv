The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Twilight Lovers Will Love It... Haters Will Obviously Hate It... I Found It Good Enough! :)
","As a Twilight lover, I was extremely excited to see this movie! Overall, I DID like it, but I felt like it was a bit rushed. It goes from one event to the other so quickly that I found myself not being fully captivated by the current event before the next one started.However, the wedding scene was beautiful and I loved the little bits of humor thrown in (speeches, Charlie's snide comments, etc). I wish there was a bit more of an emphasis on the struggle Bella went through when deciding to keep the baby, though. I felt like it was portrayed as a decision that bummed Edward out a little, whereas in the book, Edward was distraught and tortured by her decision.Either way, it was still a great movie! They had a lot of stuff to fit into 2 hours, so overall I think they did a good job. Could have been better, but I was definitely not disappointed (and neither was anyone else in the theater).If you like the saga, you'll love this movie!! If you hate the saga, you'll obviously hate this one too (although I do wonder why so many admitted haters continue to see these movies in the first place). :)",10,13,27,18 November 2011
