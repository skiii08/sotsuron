Source Code," Great movie, ending not so much.
","Right from the start this film pulls you in within the first 8 minutes and never lets go. It keeps you thinking on your toes the whole time and I loved it. The only thing that ruined it a little for me was I kind of figured out who the bomber was before the movie hit it's halfway mark, it was more of a hunch but refused to believe it was that easy. After he was revealed I felt a little disappointed but nevertheless it was still a great ride.The acting was top notch, Jake has always been one of my favorite along with Vera Farmiga and Michelle Monaghan, perfect cast. Jeffrey Wright's character made me laugh a bit with his constant twitching when he talked but nothing enough to ruin it. Everything about this movie felt good and it was a smooth ride the whole way through. The only thing that threw me for a loop was the end, at first if they stopped where it made sense then I would have given it a 10 but then something happened that couldn't have happened since he really didn't technically travel back in time he was only reliving the moment from a strangers last 8 minutes, so how could that have any ripple affect on the present? I'll have to watch it again to get a better explanation but really it would have been better if they ended it after Colleen did what she had promised.",9,0,2,4 April 2011
