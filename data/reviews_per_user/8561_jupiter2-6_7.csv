Requiem for a Dream," What Ever Happened To Baby Sara?
","Forget all your slasher and gore films, this is what is truly meant by the term 'Horror Film.' It tears every exposed nerve and no one goes unpunished including a large part of the audience who has forgotten their parents. This film through me off kilter for days.",10,0,1,26 January 2004
Dawn of the Dead," A little bit too dead
","While it has some new blood pumped into it, some things suffered from unintended anemia. The first 7 minutes gave it a great sense of urgency, it covered the outside world quite well and it seemed to be a hint of things to come. But once they were intrenched at the mall, there never seemed to be a real threat nor a sense of dread. Too many characters suddenly possessed a GI Joe personality rather than a true fear of what was happening around them, so it seemed fine just to hang out at the mall. Even the older woman seemed like she could take on anything so why not just sit tight and slowly pick them off. The zombies rarely were given a role to play so the eeriness and morbidity of the original was erased. The effects were quite beautiful but I didn't feel frightened of the what was out there. If the zombies periodically made their way in, it would have been more unsettling. Beside this remake being the most 'ungory' of gore films, it all had the feeling of being done before especially with obvious references to earlier horror films like Aliens, Dawn Of The Dead, Body Snatchers and even Rosemary's Baby. Who didn't see that coming? This is from someone who is scared of his own reflection: I never flinched. The trailers and credits were more frightening. A pretty show, with some striking images but kinda flat at the same time, not to mention another 1 note performance by Ving. I will hope for better in the DVD release which will obviously have more ghastly footage. Oh, well.",7,0,0,22 March 2004
Match Point," Surprising and effective update
","This is what Woody Allen should have been doing all along. 'Match Point' is a well-written and surprisingly, natural updating of 'An American Tragedy' aka 'A Place In The Sun' with only minor tweaks to character and circumstance. Transplanted to London, where the distinction between class structure is still more obvious, this version never seems unrealistic. Using the original premise of a man who seems to have talent but not the right set of social qualifications required to get ahead of the crowd, the main character has fortune and notoriety fall into his lap. The distinction here is that Woody Allen has married the story to the suggestion that not all our success has to do with the class we are born into, rather, a large part of who we become rests on basic luck, depending on how the wind blows on any one day. In this version, Chris Wilton (the George Eastman character in 'A Place In The Sun') remains the same but our sympathies tend to lie with his wife this time. Oddly, as in 'A Place In The Sun,' the film twists our morals into ultimately hoping that he gets away with murder. Scarlett Johannson (in the Shelley Winters role) excellently portrays the desperate but determined role of the abandoned character except in this version, she has a much less passive role. A clever scene turns up towards the end when the gold ring bounces off the Thames River railing much in the same way as the tennis ball volleys into the net at the beginning, hinting at the idea that one's fate is determined by the smallest changes or mistakes. This film never lags and, ultimately and disturbingly, questions where our loyalties lay; with common decency or with the most evil of crimes. The slight change to the ending is a perfect twist.",10,0,3,11 June 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Emperor's New Clothes
","Good, lord, How overrated can a film become? While it certainly isfun to watch, amazing scenery and mattework do not add up to a'great' film. It was one long loud soundtrack surrounding hours ofscreaming, wailing screaming, actors talking in gutteral tones todenote seriousness with some more screaming on top. Half thedialog centered around telling Frodo that he was the one tocomplete the journey. I couldn't  believe how many times eachactor got the chance to scream the word, 'NO' in slow motionbecause I lost count one hour before it ended. If you like prettypackaging, a smattering of schmaltz, non-ending slow motionphotography to fill in for gaps and dialog lost in unintelligibleaccents, this film will be a winner for you. But if you've decided thatET was not the best film ever made, you'll have long realized thatit's a flashy re-working of a book with tons of pretty windowdressing to replace quality storytellng. In fact, Ralph Bakshi'spartial animation version, not only achieved more suspense andfright but he did it with a lot less that $4 billion dollars worth ofcomputer technology, thus automatically making it a superior film. We've all seen this kind of eyecandy before.",4,1,2,18 February 2002
Garden State," Pleasant but a bit HomeEc-ish
","You won't be offended, in the least, by this film. It's very pleasant to watch and the story line doesn't require much dissection. Unfortunately, it doesn't offer much more either. It tries to be deeper than it is. The story's been told a million times before and better. Natalie Portman is the surprise here but her character starts to dull down by the end. And some of the love dialog gets pretty pretentious and trite. I might have given it a 6 had it not been for the annoying and unnecessary(and sometimes bombastic)addition of too many pop songs that seemed to be crammed into the film to fill gaps in action or dialog. It sometimes sounded like a commercial for VH1. The last scene was far too predictable for words.",5,0,1,19 March 2006
The Descent," A Nasty Little Tidbit
","Apart from some odd dialog in the beginning, this thriller/horror/monster flick is very tight, nasty and thoroughly frightening. From the uneasiness created by the tight spaces as a prelude to the action, the creepy photography and speed at which this film propels, the audience is rarely given time to breathe. Little is offered of the characters' background but enough development is in place to frame a harrowing circumstance neither these women nor the audience is ready to confront. From their point of entry into the dark hole, you always have a sense that you're in trouble and once the action takes off, you feel as hopeless as they do. It's sprinkled with references in tone, visuals and music to other films like 'Alien', 'Dawn Of The Dead,' 'Carrie' and even John Carpenter's, 'The Thing' but it never steals from them. And you rarely have a moment to even worry about how much it may resemble other films. Certainly, gore is a major element in this so be ready to cover your eyes but for those who appreciate a monster film with violent action and a predominant sense of originality, this flick will smack you upside your head and often. It never feels cheap. Except for 2 cheesy scares(which are very minor and you don't have a moment to care), this film stands tall on it's own, even offering a couple of 'morally questionable' scenarios that don't get tidied up(a plus in my book). It's a breath of fresh air for the audience if not for the trapped cavers. I can't wait to see the DVD version with the original, downer ending. Because of the 'committee' decision to not use it, I've kept from giving this film another star.",9,2,6,8 August 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Can you say 'Overkill?'
","There's nothing deep or important going on here, so  a critique of this film is almost unnecessary. What passes for quality film making is nothing more than an overproduced, loud, stunning 'Imax' experiment in eye-candy that masks, once again, a slowly moving, thin story line. Obviously, the members of SAG have dispensed with background checks on film editors. There's enough slow-motion footage here to circumnavigate the globe twice. Many people will be amazed by the neverending, in-your-face action sequences but for those who still pine to see the actors perform also, you'd better search elsewhere. It's like trying to read the Latin version of 'War And Peace' while simultaneously being pulverized inside a blender. And if having way too many computerized fight scenes forced down your throat wasn't enough, just wait the full ninety hours for the saccharine-glazed, overlit endings. And there are at least 5 of them. For a while, I was expectin Obi Wan Kenobi's ghost to show up and smile goodbye. And Cate Blanchett never looked so vapid. It's brass, tacky, loud, long, obvious schlock and thus hugely popular. Beautiful looking rarely translates to quality in content and this is a prime example. Giving so many awards to this fillibuster is just a waste of gold-plating.",1,58,158,7 June 2004
