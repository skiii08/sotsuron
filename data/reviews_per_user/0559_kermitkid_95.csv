Despicable Me 2," Too many Minions
","While this is much better and funnier than the first film, I felt it overused the Minions. What made the first film so great, was they used the Minions sparingly. This one feels more like the Minions are the stars rather than Gru and his daughters. That being said, though, I'm still looking forward to the Minions movie next year. (Speaking of which, stay during the entire first half of the credits for a little teaser of that movie.) I felt this one had a stronger villain than the first one, better jokes, and just the right amount of silliness to make this one of the best animated films of the year. It has given me a fear of chickens though. Basically, this movie will leave you feeling happy. Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars",9,1,3,30 March 2020

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Are you? Are you? Coming to the tree?
","Bravo! This is the best film in the series so far! Everyone gives an amazing performance and there's not a single actor or actress in this film I felt should have been recast. The only problem I had in this film was the CGI. It didn't look realistic. It looked like the cutscene to a Playstation 1 game. The great thing about this film is it doesn't feel rushed. It takes it's sweet time in getting to the story, and that is cruical when the story is so big and needs a lot of character development. Why must I wait a year for part 2?! Why can't they just release it a month after the Blu-ray comes out? The Hunger Games movies just keep getting better and better. I'm excited to see how they handle part 2, and I'm highly confident it will be handled with care.

The Incredible Hulk," How ironic that the strongest Avenger, has the weakest solo outing
","Worst film of Phase 1, and I'd say the whole MCU, no contest. The story is slow, the CGI is crap (Iron Man, which released a month earlier has effects that still hold up), and overall it's kind of dull.

10 Cloverfield Lane," Holy cow, John Goodman is scary
","In case you're wondering: No. You do not need to see the original 'Cloverfield' to understnad this movie. In fact, they're completely different. You can watch one or the other on its own and still enjoy them. It's going to be really hard to write this review without giving too much away (and trust me, you want to go in knowing nothing about this film.) but I'm going to try. This isn't really a 'horror' movie, per se. It's more of a post-apocalyptic thriller. The story is intriguing, but I was expecting a little bit more out of this. It's still a very intense movie, though. John Goodman did a terrific job. I'm glad to see him finally branching out of his typical 'nice guy' schtick. He's anything but nice here. In fact, he's absolutely terrifying. Watching the movie, I felt very intimidated by him. While I do say that the first 'Cloverfield' was better, this is still pretty good. Just watch them as 2 different movies where the only thing they have in common is the word 'Cloverfield' in the title. It works as its own standalone movie, which very few directors can do. Well done, JJ Abrams! You've done it again!Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars",9,0,1,30 March 2020
Iron Man 3," Solid Sequel
","When it was announced in 2009 that Disney had acquired Marvel for $4 billion
I thought 'Wow! Did they really need to, though?' Well, when The Avengers came out as the first Marvel film distributed by Disney, I was blown away! I thought, 'Wow! I can't wait to see what they do with Iron Man 3 next year.' Fast forward to May 3, 2013. I'm in a sold out show of Iron Man 3, and I'm giddier than a nerd at Comic-con. (Compliment, because I consider myself a nerd too. So no offense meant fellow nerds.) What's the first thing I hear when the movie starts?A voice over narration by Tony Stark himself. Then something amazing happens. As the opening credits roll, I hear Eiffel 65's 'I'm Blue (Da Ba Dee).'
I have to cover my mouth to keep from cheering. Then it's awesome action scene after awesome action scene. I leave the theater so excited I can't sleep that night. And yes, I did see the scene after the credits, because, to misquote a famous Lord of the Rings character 'One does not simply leave a Marvel movie before the end of the credits.' (Tell that to half my theater though.) The basic plot of the film is this. Tony Stark needs to figure out how to balance out his life as Iron Man, and spending time with Pepper, while defeating the new menace called The Mandarin. I think Robert Downey Jr. was absolutely brilliant in this, but man that precocious ten year old kid whose name I forget, really stole the show. And now I hear he's signed on for 3 more Marvel movies, which he hasn't revealed yet. Awesome!

The Maze Runner," Exciting plot
","The great thing is that from the very first frame of the movie, you're sucked in. For the most part the cast of The Maze Runner is full of unknowns. I see a great career in every actor in this film. Everyone had chemistry and I loved how this felt like the filmmakers actually read the book. I'm hoping this becomes a trend with book to film adaptations. The only thing I didn't like, was some important details in the book being left out. The films premise is 'Lord of the Flies' meets 'Lost.' Despite the 2 hour run time, it feels much shorter; but that's because it's an exciting thrill ride from beginning to end. .

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," They've brought us hope
","Holy Kenobi, this was awesome!!!!! I do acknowledge that 'Force Awakens' was a remake of 'A New Hope.' No worries here. This is a story we haven't heard before. The characters are awesome (and without giving anything away, let's just say it pays off if you watched the Clone Wars tv series), the action sequences are amazing, and it feels like classic Star Wars while at the same time providing something new. The comic relief character is extremely well written with how a bit too honest he is. This has some new genres being explored in the Star Wars universe, which was something I liked about the Clone Wars tv show. My only complaint is that at times the CGI used to make some of the cameos of characters from the Original Trilogy look young looks a bit fake, like you could tell it was CGI. It's not as bad as young Jeff Bridges in 'Tron: Legacy', but it looks a bit too shiny and at times like it's from a video game cutscene.

Captain Marvel," Needed Better Trailer Editing
","This is a perfect example of horrible marketing for a good movie. I wasn't too impressed with the trailers. They were kind of bland. I went into this with my expectations checked at the door, and this movie was above average. It wasn't as boring and uninteresting as the trailers led me to believe, but it still has faults. For an MCU movie, it's average, and for a movie it's above average. The main problem was it tried to hard to be another 'Guardians of the Galaxy' movie, but without the risks. 'Guardians' was a gamble. (A movie about a talking raccoon and a tree?! Marvel has lost their minds!). It tries to capture the wonder of a sci-fi movie, but plays it too safe. There were many factors that I felt didn't go as far as they could have. The plot is pretty paint-by-numbers as well. This movie 'borrows' too much from other films. It didn't feel enough like it's own thing. There were some amusing moments, and one in particular that got a huge laugh out of me, but the film played it too safe. The CGI is pretty impressive. I couldn't tell that the aliens in the movie were CGI. However, when there are scenes of characters flying, it definitely looks CGI, and cheap CGI at that. (Think 'video game trailer.') Larson's acting is not as wooden as the trailers would lead you to believe (most of the time anyway), nor is the character of Captain Marvel as narcissistic and rude as the trailers made her seem. She's nowhere close to my favorite MCU character, but I wouldn't mind seeing her return. I don't know what most of Hollywood has against Ben Mendelssohn's natural accent. Mendelssohn is a terrific actor, but in movies like 'Ready Player One' and this one where they make him do an American accent, it sounds fake, and is distracting. And no, this movie is not a 2 hour lecture on feminism. Contrary to the marketing, Captain Marvel doesn't put down the male characters (at least not unprovoked.) This movie actually can be enjoyed by anyone. Marvel needs to re-evaluate their marketing team.

Iron Man 2," A step down, but still fun
","Not as good as the first one, but still a pretty solid romp. It's main problem is it's trying to set up 'The Avengers' in the same way 'Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice' was trying to set up the next 20 films down the line, which in both cases, they thankfully learned from. There's enough plots in this movie to make at least 3 movies. The stuff with Black Widow and Whiplash is pretty good and really fun, but in terms of plot, it doesn't really deliver.

Peter Capaldi, who was recently cast as the 12th incarnation of Doctor Who is in this. Oddly enough he's a W.H.O. Doctor (World Health Organization) coincidence? I think not.

Zootopia," Smart and Original
","It's incredibly rare when a movie gets a 100% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. (Ok, so it's 99%, but upon further investigation I found the rotten review wasn't even a review. Rotten Tomatoes needs better scorers.) It's even rarer when I agree with Rotten Tomatoes. This is one of those times in both cases. This movie is phenomenal! The animation is stellar! The plot is very unique. It's essentially a social commentary that only looks like an animated talking animal/buddy cop movie. And it's pulled off amazingly! The jokes in this movie are hilarious and very original! There were even a few unexpectedly dark scenes where I jumped. This is one of the best animated Disney movies ever made! It's right up there with Big Hero 6 and Wreck-it Ralph. (Sorry, Frozen. You were just ok.) It's incredibly charming, and I feel like Pixar could have made this. This is definitely going to be a day 1 purchase when it hits Bluray.

Star Trek Into Darkness," Khaaaaaan!
","I went into this film knowing very little about the Star Trek universe. I'm more of a Star Wars fan. But after hearing some very favorable reviews I decided to rent the first one. I thought it was pretty good, but when I saw the trailers for Into Darkness, I thought 'This looks amazing! I should go see it.' I have to say, it was a lot better than I expected. I caught some of the references to Tribbles and the Wrath of Khan movie, which I hadn't seen but had heard the infamous 'KHAAAAAN!' scream enough to get the reference in this film. (I've seen Wrath of Khan now, thanks to the miracle of Netflix.) Plus, one of my friends is a HUGE Trekkie, so I was able to follow the plot pretty well. This is one of J.J. Abrams's best films. I can't wait to see what he does when he directs Star Wars 7! Grade: A+ 10/10 5/5",10,4,10,30 March 2020
Knives Out," Overrated
","For the most part, this is a pretty good movie, but it doesn't really get going until the second half. However, once again, Rian Johnson cannot keep his politics out of the script. (And this is coming from someone who for the most part will defend 'The Last Jedi.' (minus Admiral purple hair Holdo)) So much of it is focused on debates about immigration, and other politics. Why couldn't this have just been a mystery movie? When it satirizes the mystery stuff, it's done well, but, again, the political commentary is eye-rolling and distracting. I will say, Chris Evans was robbed of an Oscar nomination. His performance is by far the best one here, and this is a pretty star-studded cast! (It's kind of funny to hear him cursing, and at one point saying the F word, because of how many times he told people to watch their language in Avengers: Age of Ultron. That's some dang irony!) Daniel Craig's Southern accent is hilariously bad, and even the film points that out. I don't know if that was intentional, or if they just put Craig in this for name recognition. Either way, it was kind of weird. The political stuff is most likely why this nearly has a perfect score on Rotten Tomatoes and why it was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay, even though the film itself is just kind of average.

Aquaman," Better than it has any right to be
","This was fin-tastic! In my 'Justice League' review last year, I praised the way they handled Aquaman, and made him cool instead of the butt of the joke that he's been for the past 75 years. He's just as cool here. From the opening battle to the final battle, his awesomeness has no end. The story is pretty good, though I did feel like I'd seen a lot of it before, but it's such a fun journey, that I didn't care. The action sequences, at least when they're grand scale battles with wide shots or pan-shots, look gorgeous. The hand-to-hand combat stuff, not so much. The way those are shot made me feel like I was watching someone play the 'Injustice' games. Some of the dialogue is pretty corny, but that's the case with most DC films lately. They're trying to be live-action Saturday morning cartoons. I have no problem with that in the action aspect, but some of the dialogue really needed some re-writes. I usually complain about CGI in Warner Bros. movies saying how it always looks like a trailer for a PS2 game from 2004, but that's not the case here. Ok, there were some parts underwater that were very obviously green screen, but those were few and far between, at least not to the degree of 'Wonder Woman' where I could tell when things were CGI. Most of the cast is pretty good, but I do need to complain just a little bit about Amber Heard. During the fight scenes, she was great, but anytime she had dialogue, her lips came up into a sort of sneer, like she was smelling rotten eggs. It didn't matter what the line was. It always looked like that, and it was distracting, and a bit funny. A lot of times it also sounded like she was trying to imitate Scarlett Johansson with the line delivery. In fact, if I closed my eyes, I could almost mistake her for Scarlett Johansson. The movie also had a lot of unnecessary figurative hand-holding for the audience. Every time there was a new location it felt the need to tell you where you were, despite the fact that most people could figure it out from visual context clues. It's obvious we're in Atlantis, it's obvious this is the Sahara. You don't need to have the text on the screen tell us. We're not dumb. We can figure it out in the first 5 seconds of seeing the location. By far the best part of this movie is the directing and cinematography. The wide shots are just gorgeous and the non hand to hand battles are well directed too. For a movie called 'Aquaman' where the main character's power is talking to fish, this was a lot better than it had any right to be. This is definitely, surprisingly, one of DC's best.

Thor: Ragnarok," Thor 3 RaganaROCKS!
","This more than makes up for the lackluster 'Thor: The Dark World.' Although, this still could have been better. I enjoyed it and thought it was fun, but the tone and style felt out of place for a Thor movie. I kept thinking 'I'm watching Guardians of the Galaxy' with different characters. Everything from an '80s synthesizer soundtrack to bright unicorn-vomit visuals is here. While the film is fun, the plot was all over the place. It felt like watching 3 movies at once. I kept thinking 'Just pick and stick with a plotline.' It jumps from location to location and story arc to story arc very quickly, and at times it was very hard to keep up with. I had to keep backtracking at least 10 minutes in my mind to catch myself up. 'Oh yeah, that happened.' Jeff Goldblum had a lot to offer as the character 'Grandmaster'. He had some funny lines and made me laugh a few times. Cate Blanchett is chilling as the villain 'Hela.' If you thought Tom Hiddleston could be scary at times, just wait until you see her performance. There were a lot of fun Easter Eggs that foreshadow at things to come and it was overall, a very fun movie. Like I said, my only complaint is the all-over-the-place plot, but considering how boring 'Dark World' was, I'm just glad we finally got a good Thor sequel, even if at times it still could have been better.

Ready Player One," Fantastic Love Letter to the '80s and Geek Culture
","Well done Spielberg! I did not live in the 1980s. (1997), but now I know how those kids felt when they went to go see 'Back to the Future' or 'E.T.' for the first time. This really captures the feeling of an '80s film, with futuristic technology. If you have the chance, go see this in IMAX or the local equivalent of an IMAX (like I did, because my IMAX is very far, but my closest theater has a screen about the size of one) because it is HUGE. There is one scene in the beginning that was worth the extra $2. My one nitpick that I can give away without spoilers is that while Ben Mendehlson is great as the villain, I really wish they had let him keep his British accent, because his 'American' accent is distracting. (And let's be honest. Villains are more intimidating when they're British). I've complained about Warner Bros' CGI before and how it seems to me like they always cheap out when it comes to that aspect. (To me it always looks like cutscenes or trailers to a PS2 game from 2003.), but here, it was believable. I am so glad I was the only one at my screening, because I would have been kicked out for fanboying so much otherwise. This is a film where when I buy it on Bluray, I am going to need to pause it and analyze it frame-by-frame to get all the background references. The plot relies heavily on pop culture references but that's what makes it so great. It's a movie for fans (of anything) by fans. If you've ever had an obsession with pop culture (and almost everyone has at some point), this is the film for you. If you grew up in the '80s, this is definitely the film for you. You will weep with nostalgic joy.

Moana," Awesome adventure film!
","I liked this much better than 'Frozen.' Much much better. 'Frozen' felt like a typical nothing special movie that had already been done before in several Disney movies. This was very different. They even made fun of the typical Disney princess cliches. This was essentially the antithesis to the Disney Princess movies. The songs in 'Frozen' were a bit too Broadway for my taste, but the songs here were fun island tropical songs that were fun to dance to. And some of the lyrics are very clever. (Thanks, Lin-Manuel Miranda). There were also some likes of dialogue where I was laughing so hard I was crying. That hasn't happened in a long time. This was more of an adventure epic instead of a princess movie. 'Frozen' was clearly aimed at little girls, but everyone can enjoy 'Moana.' There is a short before the film that while it was clever, all I could think during it was 'Disney copied their own thing. This is Inside Out with internal organs instead of the mind.' One of the villains in the movie who was voiced by Jemaine Clement was fun, but I wish he had tried to change his voice a bit, because all I could think was 'This is the bird from 'Rio''. It was kind of distracting. This was a fun adventure movie that I give my highest regards.

","People are going to hate me for saying this, but I didn't think it was bad. It wasn't as good as the first one, but I still enjoyed it. There are some awkward moments of stilted dialogue and awkward pauses, and at times the plot can be hard to understand, and there is way too much dialogue that really just builds up to nothing. But there were still some moments I found fun. The moments of metahumor and self awareness towards the second half of the film made me laugh, there were still some good action moments. It just wasn't as investing as the first one. It wasn't awful, but it wasn't great.

Spider-Man: Homecoming," If John Hughes made a Spider-Man movie
","This was absolutely, without a doubt, the best 'Spider-Man' movie ever! It's everything I loved about Spider-Man in the comics, cartoons, and video games growing up. It has his signature wisecracks, the fun thrills, and struggles of being a teen that Spidey is famous for. Michael Keaton gives a wonderfully chilling performance as the villain. There is one scene in particular that I won't spoil where his threatening demeanor is enough the frighten even a grown man. Spidey's tech-savvy sidekick also provides some wonderful comic relief. My one complaint was the actress Zendaya. She was so monotone and bored, that I was really starting to regret Disney buying Marvel at some points. (She was a Disney Channel star.) If she had put more emotion into her lines, or had been given better direction, she could have been a more interesting character, but she just came off as bland. I will probably have to watch this movie several times when it hits Bluray, because I spotted some fun little Easter Eggs and inside jokes, and I'm sure there were plenty more that I missed. As always, stay for the very end of the credits. I'm not going to spoil anything, but lets just say that Marvel is starting to become very meta....and that's all I'm going to say about that. It's too good and too funny to spoil.

Suicide Squad," Not sure what the critics were smoking
","DC is finally learning that comic book movies can (and should) be fun. Through trial-and- error they are listening to the fans complaints and addressing them and improving with each movie. 'Man of Steel had too much action? We'll tone it down a bit in Dawn of Justice. Dawn of Justice wasn't fun enough? We'll do reshoots on Suicide Squad to make it more lighthearted.' It will still be a while before they catch up to Marvel, but for now I'm pleased with how they're trying. Although the characters look very different from the versions we are used to they still feel like the characters. There was never a point where I felt like Jared Leto and Margot Robbie's portrayals of Joker and Harley were not those characters. (Unlike Jesse Eisenburg as Lex Luthor in 'Dawn of Justice'.) Even the characters I'm not as familiar with like Deadshot and Killer Croc were still great. Will Smith and Joel Kinnamen were the most fun performances to watch next to Robbie and Leto. Even if you're not a comic fan, it's still fun just as a movie. The exposition/origins of the various characters don't take up too much time and gets those who may not be familiar with these characters up to speed. It's not even really a comic book movie, it's a human redemption story. Other than Joker and Harley the rest of the Squad aren't necessarily bad people. They've just made some bad decisions, but they're willing to repent. Deadshot doesn't want to kill for money anymore, Diablo feels he should not have his prison sentence shortened because he feels prison would be the safest place for him since he doesn't know how to control his powers and doesn't want to accidentally kill people anymore. I feel sympathy for these characters and loved how they were willing to change and redeem themselves. The one complaint I have is the villain in the third act was a bit weak and could have been improved with better writing. But considering WB/DC forced the writers to crank out the script in 6 weeks this was still better than it should have been. This has all the fun of a Marvel movie. (It reminded me most of 'Guardians of the Galaxy', especially the various songs played throughout the movie. It's one of the best soundtracks of the year.) and I'm excited to see what DC does with future movies. Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars",9,0,3,18 September 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Political Thriller makes this a fun outing for even the non superhero fans
","This is the best of the Phase 2 Marvel movies. It's what 'G.I. Joe: Retaliation' should have been. While its definitely the most serious of the movies, it still manages to have little moments of subtle humor that we've all loved since 'Iron Man.' Nick Fury plays his biggest part yet in this movie, and Black Widow is an important factor in the plot as well. Even though this is a superhero movie, it's not just turn off your brain and enjoy. It has a complex plot that you have to pay attention to. As always stay halfway through the credits, and until the end. Both scenes are extremely important to the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Ocean's Thirteen," Improvement over the sequel
","After the slog that was Ocean's 12, I'm glad to see this one learned from the mistakes of its predecessor and got back to the roots of what made Ocean's 11 so fun. Don Cheadle finally gave up on his terrible Cockney accent, and 3 out of every 4 of his lines are said in an American accent. A lot of the heist moments were really smart, and it was a just an all around good 'Robin Hood' type story. The villain was a real scumbag, and that made it easy to root for the main characters even though they aren't the best people either. This film was missing a lot of the heart that 'Eleven' had and that was disappointing. I feel there should have been more drama between the characters and story. This was an improvement over 'Twelve' but not as good as 'Eleven'.

Doctor Strange," 'Strange' concept pays off well
","This was amazing!!!! I went into this movie knowing nothing about the character. I kept myself completely in the dark. No comics, no animated movies, staying off Thursday night. Glad I did. There were tons of moments that wowed and surprised me, that I don't think would have had as big of an impact if I had read the source material beforehand. It was like putting Jedi in the movie 'The Matrix.' The visuals are so mind-bending that this is one of the very few times I would say go see it in 3D. (Unless you get headaches easily or suffer from motion sickness. Then stick with the standard version). The 3D is more than worth the extra price. The opening seen alone already feels like it was worth every penny. The movie is also very deep and thought provoking. 'Civil War' was thought-provoking in a political way, and this is thought provoking in a science/psychological way. Benedict Cumberbaych does amazingly as always, but I do feel like he was typecast. He seems to be playing the 'I'm smarter than you and I'm going to let you know I'm smarter than you every chance I get' character over and over. I'm worried he'll become like Johnny Depp and end up eventually becoming a parody of himself. I don't want to spoil anything, because like I said before, it's better to go in knowing nothing. I will say that I hope Marvel takes more risks with more obscure characters and that Fox finally stops being selfish and just gives them the rights to 'X-Men' and 'Fantastic Four' already! I want to see Tony Stark, Stephen Strange, Bruce Banner, Hank Pym, and Reed Richards have a science debate. Just make one big banter-fest movie of these characters. Just witty back and forth dialogue between them. That would be awesome! I'm excited to see how this movie ties in to 'Infinity War.' Definitely looking forward to seeing Doctor Strange appear in future movies.

Interstellar," Nolan's latest film is quite 'Stellar'
","If this film isn't nominated for some awards at the Oscars, there's something wrong with the Academy. This is one of the best films of 2014, and it definitely deserves more than 73% fresh. That's too low of a score. I'd say it's more around the 90-95% range. It's an absolutely amazing film. Pardon the pun, but I'd even go so far as to say this movie is...wait for it...stellar. This is what 'Gravity' should have been. It's a very thought provoking film and needs to be at least nominated for 'Best Picture' at the Academy Awards. There are some issues with sound mixing where the sound muffles the dialogue sometimes, but according to Christopher Nolan, this was intentional. Don't wait for Blu-ray. See it while it's still in theaters! Your stomach will rumble when the ships take off, and you will be amazed at the visual effects. This film has plenty of heart, humor, and an intriguing plot that will make you forget it has a 3-hour runtime. It feels more like 2 hours.

It's everything Transformers should have been. Michael Bay, if you're reading this, have the director of this help you with Transformers 4. You absolutely must see this on the big screen. Don't wait for the DVD/Bluray. It's a BIG movie that absolutely positively MUST be seen in the theater. It's got action, explosions, wit, and is definitely the best movie of summer 2013. My only complaint is it ran a little too long. They could have cut a half hour. Grade: A+ 10/10 5/5 stars.",10,0,1,30 March 2020
Lion," This movie's great! I'm not lyin!
","This movie was amazing! I'm still overwhelmed by how fantastic and beautifully done this was! It's one of the few non R-rated Best Picture nominees of 2016, so I decided to give this rare oppurtunity a shot. I'm so glad I did. This is an absolute must see. The first half of the film is in different dialects of Indian with English sutitles, and that can be kind of hard to get through, but about 45 minutes or so into the movie when the dialouge is mostly in English for the remainder of the film. Dev Patel and costar Rooney Mara have something in common. They've both starred in terrible films, but have redeemed themselves with Oscar nominated films. (Patel was in that garbage 'Last Airbender' movie, and Mara was in the most recent 'Fantastic Four' remake and 'Pan', but has starred in 'The Martian which I liked.) This deserves the Best Supporting Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay awards it won. I agree with some critics that some parts of the film moved at a slow pace, but in my opinion the emotion portrayed in those scenes far outweighs the slow pace. The film is emotional and nearly made me cry. It's an absolutely fantastic and brilliant piece of cinema.

Ant-Man," Paul Rudd becomes Small Rudd
","I really enjoy that Marvel movies don't just stick with one genre. Just as Captain America was a war movie and a superhero movie, this is a heist movie and superhero movie. (Meanwhile at DC) It's pretty hard to get excited about a superhero who's only powers are shrinking and controlling ants. Especially because the original Ant-Man is not the main character, so if you're not familiar with the comics you may be confused. It's a different kind of Marvel movie. The theme of passing the torch has not yet been seen in any Marvel film. I loved that we've got the original hero passing on his legacy to a guy who really needs to change his life for the better. This has everything we've come to expect from an MCU movie. Humor, action, a good story, and cameos for the fans. It's reminded me of Guardians of the Galaxy, a lot. And that's a good thing, because I enjoyed that movie a lot. It's because of this movie that Paul Rudd will forever be known as Small Rudd. It's not the best MCU movie, (so far, that's Captain America: The Winter Soldier), but it is a fun little movie that will be known as a gamble that Marvel took, that paid off in the long run.Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars",9,1,2,30 March 2020
Captain America: The First Avenger," There are already so many big men fighting this war. Maybe what we need now is a little guy

Justice League," It's no 'Avengers', but it doesn't need to be
","Once again, the critics are wrong. This. was. Awesome! You know you're in for a fun time when 'Written by Joss Whedon' pops up on the screen! It's got almost everything a Justice League movie should have. Humor, action, witty dialogue....It's almost on par with Marvel. Almost. Really, my only negative critique is the villain was really dumb. It's a Justice League movie and they give us Steppenwolf?! Really?! Even when Steppenwolf shows up, he doesn't do anything. The battle is over as quickly as it begins. The 3rd act and/or villain really should have been changed. But, hey, this movie managed to make Aquaman awesome! He's like a cross between a heavy metal guitarist and a professional wrestler. Everything about him is awesome, including the self-awareness that for the past 76 years, he's been a joke. He's the character that doesn't take no for an answer, doesn't care what people think of him, and is just awesome! The only character cooler than him is Batman, and that's because he's Batman. I did have one more problem with the story. If you're a casual fan without any knowledge as to who Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg are you may be confused as their origin stories are only glanced over or completely ignored. If they had given it another hour to take time to explain the characters' backstories that would have been super helpful. Instead we need to rely on context clues through quick dialogue. Hopefully we get an extended cut on the Bluray. It has some problems, but it's definitely a step in the right direction. At the end of the day, I was entertained, and that;s all that matters. By the way, stay ALL the way through the credits. There are 2 scenes.

Man of Steel," Look, up in the sky!
","While it's a great improvement over Stupidman (er, Superman) Returns, Man of Steel is not without flaws of its own. For one, the climax had too much building smashing. Who does Superman think he is, the Hulk? And another thing, it's not shown that Superman has weaknesses. No Kryptonite in sight. So that's a big problem when you have Superman, who is practically immortal, vs. General Zod who is also practically immortal. The ending is like watching a game of Chess that you know is going to end in a stalemate. Luckily it doesn't, but I'm not saying how. Plus, it feels like, to quote Journey 'the movie never ends, it goes on and on and on and on.' Don't get me wrong I thought this was great! For one, much better writing than Superman Returns. Another thing, it feels darker than a Superman movie normally is, which isn't surprising considering Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight Trilogy) was the producer. That's a great improvement over the other films, which, compared to this feel silly. And Bonus: In 2015 when Man of Steel 2 comes out, Superman AND Batman FINALLY come together on the big screen! I'm really looking forward to that! Grade: B- 8/10 4/5 stars",8,7,9,30 March 2020
Bridge of Spies," Robbed!
","I'm disappointed in the Academy. This movie only won 1 Oscar. (Best Supporting Actor). While I do agree with that verdict, I feel it also should have won for Best Score. (Yes, I feel this should have beaten Star Wars: The Force Awakens, although that film didn't win either.) The score for this movie is absolutely phenomenal! It just swells! I could listen to it all day. Tom Hanks is great in the leading role, (Let's be honest. When isn't Tom Hanks great?) the script has stellar writing (although it is slow in several parts, and if you don't study law you may lose interest during them as I did), and the overall film is just great! The opening scene alone is superb! Spielberg has done it again! Steven Spielberg directing a movie starring Tom Hanks. Thank you, Hollywood executive who greenlit this. If I had seen this prior to the end of 2015, it would have been on my top 10 list for sure!

Split," Terrifying
","I've had skepticism with M. Night Shamalayan lately. His films have been kind of hit-and-miss these past few years. I think if he does more of what he did with this movie, he can be back on top in a few years. This movie is crazy intense! It was actually a lot darker than I thought it would be. There are some extremely mature and dark themes and subject matter and it almost goes into rated R territory at points. However, it is these themes and subject matter that make these characters who they are, and explains why they act the way they do. James McAvoy's performance is particularly impressive. This film proves that he can play anyone a director needs him to play. There's moments where he's funny there's moments where he's chilling, and there's moments where his performance makes you hold your breath worried he'll harm you. The three young actresses in the film provide stellar performances as well. There's such range of emotion with them. You sympathize with them, you fear for them, you feel what they feel. Genuine, tearful performances, that actually look tearful and not like acting are hard to come by, and they pulled it off very well. Like I said, this film is very heavy. It's a hard PG-13. I don't want to advocate for this film due to the dark, heavy themes and subject matter so I don't want to say that it was a good movie. At times, it is very hard to watch. But judging it purely from a filmmaking standpoint of 'Was it well made? Was it well written? Was it well acted? Was it well directed?' etc. the answer is yes. If you're a fan of M Night's earlier work, this hearkens back to that. It's still too early at this point to say if he's redeemed himself from the garbage that was 'The Last Airbender' and 'After Earth', but if he can keep doing what he did with this film, he just might.

Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," It beat Disney and deserved to!
","Last year, I said that 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' was the best Spider-Man movie ever. I was wrong. This is! It has the perfect amount of action, drama, and comedy. Allegedly, the directors, Phil Lord and Chris Miller, were fired from the Han Solo movie because their vision was 'too comedic.' This movie proves they can balance drama and comedy perfectly, and I'm hoping this film opens the floodgates for them with other studios wanting to hire them. The animation took some getting used too as it is computer-animated, but meant to look like a comic book not quite completely CGI, but not quite completely hand-drawn either. What was clever about this very unique animation style was in certain close-up shots you could see the little dots that you would see in the pages of a comic book if you zoomed in with a magnifying glass. This movie already blew my mind, but if it had come out when I was 6, it would have blown my mind even more so. This is the Spider-Man movie I would have wanted as a kid, and I can't help but feel jealous of kids today who are my age when the original Spider-Man movie came out in 2002. The backstories for the various Spider-people are told very well, and even if you're not familiar with all the various iterations of the character, you still don't feel lost. (and this movie barely scratches the surface of the Spider-Man lore. There are still many, many, versions of Spider-Man that can be touched on, and I look forward to seeing them in the sequel). This is perfect for kids and adults! If this is not nominated for an Oscar next year, something is wrong with the Academy. There was absolute nothing about this movie to complain about!

Divergent," This is not Hunger Games. This is not Twilight
","Despite what most people think this is nothing like 'The Hunger Games.' Are there similarities? Yes, but there are also similarities to the Giver and I don't hear people calling plagiarism on that. While some of the dialogue is a bit cliche, and it felt like I'd seen some of the movie before, as a whole, I enjoyed it. They could have chosen a better actress for the main character, Tris, because at times it feels like Shailene Woodley is not delivering the dialogue as she should be. Sometimes she sounds bored, and sometimes she overacts, but Kate Winslet portraying the evil leader of their post-apocalyptic world saves it because she's almost as creepy as Donald Sutherland's portrayal of President Snow in the Hunger Games. I enjoyed the subtle bits of humor sprinkled throughout what is otherwise a dark film. The first hour or so was a bit slow, but the third act was great. I was really enthralled by Hans Zimmers' score, and the electronica music inserted here and there, even though it makes no sense to have it there. I have never read the books (and don't plan to because I want to be surprised) but still enjoyed the film. This is one YA novel film adaptation series I hope succeeds.

Ender's Game," ignore the controversy
","This is one of the best sci-fi movies you'll see this year! Ignore all the trolls on IMDB who are 'boycotting' this film because of Orson Scott Card's political views, as the film (and the book it's based on, which I highly recommend) have literally nothing to do with them. If you live near an IMAX you should definitely see it in that format. (It's worth the price despite not being in 3D) The scenes in the Battle Room, the space battles, and every scene on the ship cannot be seen in their entirety without IMAX. (Meaning you don't see the whole set in a regular format. IMAX has wider view.) The battles among the kids are just amazing, the inner conflict with Ender is well written, and the ending has a great message that will unfortunately leave you hanging and waiting for the sequel. Asa Butterfield personally would not have been my choice for Ender, but he did pretty well. And if you think Harisson Ford and Ben Kingsley are too old to act, think again! Overall, Ender's Game is just absolutely brilliant filmmaking. Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars",9,1,2,30 March 2020
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," I do accept my mission
","Mission: Impossible is one of the few franchises where it doesn't get worse every movie. It either stays about the same or gets better, depending on the movie. That being said, this is easily one of the best in the series. Knowing that Tom Cruise does his own stunts makes this movie so much cooler. There's scenes in here that are quite impressive. I won't say what they are though, because, spoilers. This reminded me of Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The entire movie kept me engaged. There were hardly any boring scenes. It's exciting, and had done great twists. My only complaint is I found one scene quite predictable.

","If you think movies based off toys are a bad idea, (Transformers) this proves it wrong. I know it's only February, but I think I can easily say this is one of the best animated movies of 2014. And unlike the Lego video games, the characters actually speak. There's also a lot of cameos from other Lego figures, some of which are characters you might recognize. It's clear the filmmakers put a lot of thought and heart into this movie. The Lego Movie is a definite blockbuster. (Yeah that's right, I said blockbuster.) Exaggerated personalities of DC superheroes also make it a great film for those who are not Lego fans.

","If you're looking for a movie that has twists and turns and a plot that you have to pay attention to the movie to follow, this is it. I can easily say this is the best film in the X-Men franchise. It's got humor, heart, and a greatly satisfying ending. This is the ultimate geek movie. I mean what other movie has Jean Luc Packard and Gandalf in the same movie. (The actors of course, not the characters. That movie is too awesome to exist. This film is X-traordinary. There are too many boring parts though. But when it comes to action, this film delivers. This is why it's one of the best movies in the summer 2014 movie season.

Captain America: Civil War," When someone tells you to move, tell them 'No. You move!'
","This is the best Marvel movie yet! Even if you're not a superhero fan, I still highly recommend this, because it doesn't feel like a superhero movie. Much like 'Winter Soldier' it's more of a political thriller. It makes you think, and debate about accountability and other important issues, which is very unusual for a superhero film. It's not just mindless action. The action sequences, by the way, are some of the best I've seen in any superhero movie, Marvel or otherwise. They're choreographed so well. There's a lot that goes on, yet you never feel lost or overwhelmed during them. Up until this point, Andrew Garfield was my favorite actor to portray Spider-Man. Move over, Andrew Garfield. Newcomer Tom Holland has taken your spot. I was a bit skeptical when he showed up in the trailers because I thought he sounded way too young. But when he started throwing around one-liners in true Spider-Man fashion, all that doubt instantly went away. Fun fact: Tom Holland starred alongside Chris Hemsworth in 'In The Heart of the Sea,' and it's because of Hemsworth's recommendation of Holland for the role of Spider-Man to Kevin Feige, the head of Marvel Studios that Holland was cast in the role. Great choice, Chris Hemsworth! I'm excited to see what this young man has in store for the future. This was everything I wanted, and more. Every time I think 'Marvel can't possibly top this,' they prove me wrong. But that's my worry. I'm worried that every Marvel film will try to outdo the predecessors by being bigger and better every time, until the MCU is eventually crushed by its own unattainable expectations. But until that day, I'll enjoy what the MCU has to offer. I expect great things from the next one: Doctor Strange. Great things, indeed. #TEAMCAP

Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Surprisingly fun 'Potter' spin-off
","I didn't see this in theaters because I have not liked Eddie Redmayne in previous works. To me, he was always a little bit too over-the-top. So I was a bit skeptical about this. Not to mention, I've frankly had enough of Harry Potter. I love it, but there is such a thing as too much. Especially when this movie was very obviously a blatant cashgrab. But after everyone telling me how good it was, I decided to at least rent it. I'm actually glad I did. I went in with my expectations low. I wasn't determined to hate it, I just thought at the most it would be OK. It was actually quite good. Not just as a Harry Potter spin-off, but just as a fantasy movie alone. And to my surprise, Eddie Redmayne was actually enjoyable. He was fun and quirky, while not being over-the-top. I'm actually nominating him as a contender to replace Peter Capaldi on 'Doctor Who' when this season is done. Even if you've never seen a Harry Potter movie you'll enjoy this, since it's not really connected to the other films for the most part. Will you get more out of it if you have? Yes, but only because of small references here and there that basically say 'Hey, we're in the same universe.' I enjoyed the differences in the magical world culture between England and the US. In England, non-wizards are called 'Muggles.' In the US they're called 'No-Maj's.' (As in 'No-Magic.') And there's a lot of school pride/rivalry between whether Hogwarts or the US equivalent Livermorny is better. Nice nod to the previous works. Apparently we're supposed to get 5 of these things, but honestly I don't see how. It works pretty well as one film, and is pretty self-contained. There's no big reveal or cliffhanger to set up the next movie. To be honest, I'm not even sure how it could continue but I'm excited to see how.

Ocean's Eleven," Classic Heist Movie
","Finally got around to watching this, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. It took a while to get going, but when it did , I was hooked. I enjoyed the film's many twists and smart writing. I had forgotten about things that were set up early on that ended up paying off later. There were several moments where I found myself going 'Oh no. How are they going to get out of this one?' Much like the vault the main characters try to rob in the film, it had many twists and turns. It was just an all-around good old fashioned heist movie though a bit dated. You can definitely tell by the pop culture references, lighting, fashion/hairstyles, and cinematography that this was made in 2001. But maybe it was cool at the time. I don't know. The banter between the main characters is witty. I'm excited to see what happens in the sequels and the reboot/sequel opening this week.

Inside Out," Genuine
","This is not only one of the best animated films of the year, it's one of the best films of the year, period. I'm glad to see Pixar slowly returning to form, by making charming, original films for the whole family. I've noticed that they've evolved from making movies that were considered 'kids films' and going into deeper, more complex themes. As the audience who first saw Toy Story in 1995 (20 years ago) has grown up, so have Pixar's movies grown up with them. Pixar does the impossible. They make films for older audiences, while at the same time keeping them appropriate for the children who want to see it. We all know that this will win Best Animated Film at the Oscars next year simply because it has the Pixar name attached to it, but this is one of those times where I agree. (So far. That may change, because we still have Minions, Hotel Transylvania 2, Peanuts, and Pixar's next film The Good Dinosaur coming out this year.) I enjoyed the more subtle bits of humor for older audiences, that 10 years from now kids will rewatch this film and say 'oh, now I get it.' I thought I would be able to predict the plot, but the movie proved me wrong. I was not able to predict any of the plot other than what was shown in the trailers. This is one of Pixar's best. It makes up for Brave and Cars 2. I liked those, just not as much. I wouldn't say those are their best. This movie made me very emotional. (No pun intended) It's definitely a film that little kids won't appreciate as much as older audiences, because it's so deep. There is also a short before the movie called 'Lava' about 2 volcanoes who fall in love. I thought that was great, too. The whole story was told through an island song which I felt was very unique. That definitely deserves some Oscar love too in the Best Animated Short category.Grade: A+ 10/10 5/5 stars",10,2,3,30 March 2020
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Better sequel
","While the first one took it's sweet time getting to the story, this just jumps right into the action. But get ready for characters that aren't even in the book, like Legolas. And the motion capture for turning Benedict Cumberbatch into the dragon Smaug is amazing. Peter Jackson knows the right people to do motion capture, as we all know from watching Andy Serkis as Gollum all these years. But really?! 3 hours?! That's stretching it wouldn't you say? Almost as stretched as butter scraped over too much bread. I didn't see this one in 3D, which is a real shame, because it seems I would have benefited a lot from it. Smaug breathing fire towards the audience would have looked amazing in 3D. Then again, the 3D is HFR, so probably not.

Toy Story 4," A delightful trip to the toy box
","I was as skeptical as anyone when this movie was announced. 'Really? A 4th one? After the 3rd one ended so perfectly? What a cashgrab! Why is Disney forcing them to make this?' But this movie actually had a lot of heart and effort into this. If 'Toy Story 3' made you cry, oh boy. This will make you cry maybe even harder. They didn't need to put as much effort into this movie as this movie as they did, but they did. They did that for us. This is one of the great Pixar movies! I noticed that the Pixar movies hardly anybody remembers such as 'Brave', 'The Good Dinosaur', 'Monsters University' and 'Finding Dory' (just to name a few) are the ones that have little to no emotion put into them, but the great ones such as 'Inside Out', 'Coco', and others are the ones that make you feel something. They raise hard questions, they make you evaluate your life. They can be kid-friendly, but also mature. And this is one of those. As soon as the opening credits started, I started tearing up, and the film just didn't let up from there. This has themes of letting go, accepting you can't have what you want in life, finding your life's purpose. It's some pretty mature stuff for the audience of 5 year olds. But there is so much heart and effort put into this movie. Pixar has done it again. If they put even half the effort into 'Incredibles 2' as they put into this, that could have been one of the great Pixar films. Despite my skepticism, this was a thoroughly emotional film, with lots of heart, and lots of laughs.

","When it comes to action, this film really lives up to its title. The action is indeed non-stop. While the film is not without flaws and plotholes, it's got enough spirit and thrill to make up for it. (However, there is one genuinely sweet moment that was unnecessarily turned into a comic relief moment) I came in with my expectations high and left thinking the film was better than I thought it would be. Just imagine how much better this would have been if I had come in with my expectations low. There's twists and turns at every moment, some details that you have to really have to pay attention to the film to notice, (and you will be rewarded for doing so) and some bait-and-switch moments that will surprise you. The whole film feels like a game of mafia set on an airplane. A game in which the audience is constantly fooled. You will not be dissapointed if you see this film.

How to Train Your Dragon 2," Perfect sequel
","Dreamworks has done the impossible! They've officially beaten Pixar as the best computer animation studio. Sure they've had some duds, but so has Pixar. (I'm referring to Brave) This is one of the best, if not the best, of all the films they've put out. Don't expect this to wrap everything up though, because just like Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, this isn't a sequel, but rather act 2 of a 3 act story that you have to watch in order. Fans of the book series may be dissapointed to learn however, that just like the first film, its completely different from the books. This is also not the same formula that Dreamworks has used for 'Shrek' and 'Madagascar.' Unlike those films this has a darker, more serious tone and is definitely anything but cookie cutter. I'm optimistic that 'Dragons 3' will not be Dreamworks milking a dead cow, but rather making a fresh cut of prime rib out of it.

Avengers: Infinity War," Breaks the 'Spider-Man 3' and 'Dawn of Justice' curse
","I was a bit worried about this film. Yes, Marvel is nearly perfect, but I was also worried that we would have another 'Spider-Man 3' or 'Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice' situation where it's too overstuffed with characters that it becomes hard to follow. This is not the case. It does jump around from place to place frequently, and I wish the plot had flowed better, but I was still able to follow what was going on. This has possibly the best villain in all of the MCU! Thanos is the Darth Vader of this franchise! He's the villain you love to hate and are genuinely afraid of. The actors bounce off of each other very well and the dialogue is as fast-paced and witty as we've come to expect from Marvel. While at times, it does feel like watching a bunch of video game cutscenes edited together, the movie is so enthralling that my first reaction to the credits (other than pure surprise for reasons I don't dare spoil) was 'It's over already?! It just started 20 minutes ago? What? It started almost 3 hours ago?! How is that possible?' That's how much this film pulled me in! It's well worth the 10 year wait! It's amazing to see all these characters interact with each other! There are some really amazing shots and moments, which again, I won't spoil. There's a reason Marvel was unusually secretive with this film. Other than the story not flowing as well as it should have, there isn't anything to complain about with this film.

Aladdin," A new fantastic point of view
","If 'Dumbo' earlier this year was an example for Disney of how not to do a remake, this is a great example of exactly how to do one. This far exceeded my expectations. I love Guy Ritchie's other films ('Sherlock Holmes', 'Man From UNCLE', 'Stardust', among others), and so I expected this film to pretty good, but this just wowed me! The film is different enough that it's not just watching the animated one again, but familiar enough to stay true to the story. I see this film as a fairy tale that has been passed down and changed slightly over time (as actual fairy tales are.) Believe it or not, there are spoilers for this movie (not this review, though). I know the biggest question is 'How is Will Smith as the Genie?' I'm not going to compare him to Robin Williams, because that's not fair, but I will say that he is the best part of the film. He does exactly what the character of the Genie is supposed to do: Be the comic relief who occasionally gives helpful, friendly advice. It's a throwback to his 'Fresh Prince' days. The plot does move a bit quickly in the beginning and some scenes from the original are switched around or changed slightly (Even the songs have some new lyrics!), but I felt that made the film fresher. There are some amazing dance sequences in this film that reminded me of a Bollywood flick. Also, side-note, my screening was in 3D, but it added nothing, so don't pay the extra $5 for the 3D. This is probably the most visually impressive, best directed film this year so far. I had a smile on my face the whole time and was totally enthralled.

The Theory of Everything," I still say Benny C was robbed!
","I still say Benedict Cumberbatch should have won the Oscar for Best Actor, but Eddie Redmayne did a good job. He makes you believe that he is Stephen Hawking. This movie is very emotional, heartfelt, and beautiful. If I had seen this prior to making my Best of 2014 list, it would have been on there. I really enjoyed the score, and everyone acting did a great job. I really enjoyed the 2 'Doctor Who' references, and the theory that was used in the movie 'Interstellar.' It was amazing seeing how Stephen Hawking was suddenly diagnosed with this disease, and was expected to live for only 2 years as of the day of diagnosis, but defied those expectations and is still alive today. I really appreciate the care that the filmmakers took in making the film as accurate as possible. The real Stephen Hawking even said that at certain points of the film he thought he was watching himself. While I do disagree with the Academy, I still thoroughly enjoyed this film and am happy that it at least won some awards, even if I don't agree with the Best Actor win.

The Lion King," Um....Why?
","Did not need to be made! It adds nothing! It improves nothing! It's just a visually impressive film. It's meant to show off, like how Polar Express was made to show off motion capture, or the old Disney films like Snow White and Cinderella were made to show off animation. This just seems like an advertisement to other studios for a new CGI program. They also ruined Be Prepared! You will miss nothing by skipping this film.

A Quiet Place," Shh...quiet. You might tick somebody off
","Or the love of gravy, do NOT bring loud concessions into this movie. People WILL hear it and you will ruin the movie for everyone. This is definitely one of the best thrillers I have ever seen! It's like an M. Night Shamalayn movie back when he still cared about his career. (Although he is slowly redeeming himself with films like 'Split'). Very few scary movies will illicit a reaction from me. This was one of them. Without spoiling anything, something happens in the first 5 minutes that lets you know that this film is NOT playing around. There is very, very little dialogue. Most of the story is told through sign language with subtitles and it works very well. It's a movie where you can put yourself into the characters' situation and understand why they make the choices they make. This movie needs to be nominated for 'Best Sound Mixing' and/or 'Best Sound Editing' when the 2019 Oscars roll around. Definitely worth seeing. Just hope that your audience isn't loud and rude, which will ruin the movie for you. And please turn off your cellphones.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," More fun than expected
","This....was actually a lot better than I expected. Considering how awful ''At World's End' was (although I did enjoy 'On Stranger Tides') I went in with low expectations. I thought at best it would be mediocre. But they went in a different direction with this one. It feels more like a reboot of the franchise than an actual sequel. But yes, Johnny Depp is still doing the same schtick, and yes, it does wear thin. However the new characters played by Brendon Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario were interesting, and had some surprise connections to other characters that I will not spoil. Also, the villain played by Javier Bardem, he was cool for the first 20 minutes he was onscreen, but sadly, like Depp, he started to feel like a caricature that wore thin. Out of all the 'Pirates' villains, he was definetely the weakest. And there's a flashback sequence with a young Jack Sparrow where it's very obvious that CGI was used on Johnny Depp and it just looks awful. They couldn't have just cast a young actor? The story is the best story of the sequels, and it feels like there was some effort put into it, and it was actually pretty fun. A lot of the dialougue was witty and I did laugh a few times. Considering this is 'Pirates 5' it was better than it had any right to be. Nothing will ever match the first one, because the first one was unique. It took something that shouldn't have worked, and not only did it make it work, it made it work well. That's something that will never be able to be repeated, and I agree, these films do need to stop. I think having different writers and directors helped this film. It made sense, wasn't too terribly long, and knew when it needed to give more, or give less. That's something that the other sequels haven't been able to accomplish. Is it worth paying full price? No, but it wouldn't hurt to go see it on a $5 Tuesday if you have that or waiting for a discount theater.

X-Men: Apocalypse," A worthy entry
","X2: X-Men United is still my favorite in the franchise. The plot for this one wasn't exactly the best compared to, say, 'First Class,' or 'Days of Future Past.' It's easily the weakest in this prequel trilogy, but there were still some fun moments. The '80's pop culture references were clever and the action was fun. Quicksilver is still the fun comic relief character that he was in 'Days of Future Past.' Although, they did reuse the 'he runs so fast that time stops so he messes with stuff while he does his job' gag from 'Days of Future Past,' and it just felt unnecessary and redundant. It was only funny the first time, guys. Sorry. Apocalypse certainly isn't the best villain this franchise has had, but he was still enjoyable. The cinematography in this was spot-on. I was excited to be introduced to some new mutants that are now on my favorites list. (Not saying who though. Spoilers). It's a good movie, but the plot could have been better thought out.

Coco," Perfect
","Pixar is going back to their roots! Their last few films such as 'Brave,' 'The Good Dinosaur' 'Finding Dory', and 'Cars 3' were all mediocre, or at least below the bar of what I've come to expect from Pixar. This gets back to what put Pixar on the map in the first place: Amazing stories with a heartfelt message. The visuals in this movie are amazing! They pop off the screen! I'm amazed how Pixar manages to outdo themselves with the animation every year. They really put a lot of time, care, and effort into making this film the best it could be. The story is fantastic, has some good twists and a bit of dark humor (which is surprising from Pixar), and an important, heartfelt message that will make you emotional. The songs in this movie were fun and catchy (although it is not a musical). This is one of the few times where I agree that Pixar should win all the Oscars, as opposed to more recent years where I said that they had monopolized and stolen the awards from films I thought were superior. As hard as I tried, I couldn't find anything to nitpick. Nothing that would dock this film from being a perfect score. It's not that I didn't want to like the film, but part of being a film critic is being critical. I tried to find something, anything, that could improve this film, but as hard as I tried, I just couldn't. It's a perfect film! This will definitely win the Oscar for Best Animated Film, and this time I agree that it deserves to instead of 'It's Pixar. It wins by default.'

Big Hero 6," On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate this film?
","Finally! A movie I will agree with the Academy on, if it wins Best Animated Feature. This movie is definitely up there with 'Bolt' and 'Wreck-it Ralph.' It's got an 'Incredibles' feel to it, and is one of the best movies to come out in 2014. I absolutely loved it, and now I forgive Disney for making the atrocity that was 'Frozen.' This is seriously one of the best, if not THE best, Disney movie ever. This is one of the very few times I agree with Rotten Tomatoes. It holds a 90% 'fresh' rating, and I think that that is an accurate rating. (It should have been 100%, though. Who are these critics who caused it to be less than 100%? They need to see it again.) I will definitely see this again when it hits our discount theater, and then buy it on Blu-ray the day it comes out. This was apparently based on a Marvel comic, and I wish this movie great success, and hope this will convince Disney and Marvel to open the floodgates for more lesser-known Marvel properties. Baymax: On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate this film? The answer is 10.

Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Ignore the trolls.
","I'm still reeling and processing what it is that I just watched! Holy cow this movie was intense! It challenges what we thought a Star Wars movie could be. It takes the franchise and shakes it up to new levels of writing and intensity we never thought possible! As a huge Star Wars fan, I've tried my hand at writing fan fiction and I could not have written anything better. The first 5 minutes alone are some of the best in the franchise. I have never laughed so hard during a Star Wars movie than I did in the first 5 minutes. The dialogue is riveting, the plot twists are insane, and the characters, both old and new have definitely developed a lot more. There's a reason Lucasfilm gave the director of this film, Rian Johnson, 3 more Star Wars films to direct after episode 9 comes out. It is certainly well deserved. The film is like a rollercoaster that flips you upside down, backwards, zigzags and jsut when you think you're done, throws you for a loop one last time. Rian Johnson has definitely earned his place among the great Star Wars storytellers, and deservedly so. It's got everything I want in a Star Wars movie, and more. Heart, humor, edge-of-your-seat thrills, emotional moments that made me cry, and just a touch of nostalgia. Johnson has done what we never thought would be possible. He dethroned 'Empire Strikes Back' as the best Star Wars movie! There was nothing about this movie that I did not like. It was perfect! The Force is definitely strong with this one.

Guardians of the Galaxy," Cosmic Adventure is a lot of fun
","This feels more like a parody of the previous Marvel movies, then a legitimate one. That's not a bad thing though, because the constant humor keeps you interested and laughing the whole time. With so many retro gadgets, such as a Walkman, this film may make you nostalgic for the 80s. It has heart, humor and Easter eggs galore. Some people may feel they want to skip this one, because the premise is too unusual. Don't do that. The zaniness is part of its charm. Marvel took a risk, and it paid off tremendously.

","Dear Academy: If you don't nominate Benedict Cumberbatch for Best Actor, then change whoever votes on these things because they clearly don't know what they're doing. This is one of the best films of the year. It's very well done. Benedict Cumberbatch, as always, does a fantastic job. It's a very thought-provoking movie that I highly recommend to everyone. You really need to pay attention throughout the movie, or you'll miss some very important elements that contribute to the plot. It's got just the right mix of drama and humor, and is a great way to learn a little something about history, too. This needs to be shown in high school history classes. It's one of the most important, if not the most important movie you will see this year. If you can only see one movie this year, see this one.

Jurassic World," Finally, a good 'Park' sequel
","The great thing about this movie is that it has throwbacks to the original 'Jurassic Park.' The scene with the injured Triceratops in the original is now an injured Brachiosaurus. It's great that this is a remake and a sequel at the same time. The nostalgia factor is there for those who saw the original when it first came out, while at the same time keeping it fresh for a new generation. Chris Pratt doesn't disappoint with his special brand of sarcastic humor. His performance as dinosaur wrangler Owen is great. I said in my Iron Man 3 review that I hope the kid who played Harley does more acting in the future. He is in this, and he is as funny in this as he was in Iron Man 3. Some critics have complained that the story focused too much on the humans and not enough on the dinosaurs. I disagree. There was just enough teasing the dinosaurs to keep me interested even when they weren't on screen. A footprint here, a claw there, but never actually a full dinosaur until much later. And I won't spoil the finale, but its easily the best thing this franchise has ever done.

Avengers: Age of Ultron," Scarlet Witch is my wifey
","They do need to figure out how to settle on a genre with these movies, because I'm not sure what they were going for. At times it felt like I was watching a cartoon, and other times a sci-fi movie. I will say that James Spader's performance as Ultron was chilling. I got chills down my spine every time he spoke. The advantage of Disney owning Marvel is they can have villians sing otherwise happy Disney songs and ruin people's childhoods by making them creepy. Now, concerning the characters of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. (Scarlet Witch is my MCU crush!) Neither of their actor(esses) sounds genuinely Russian, and at times you can tell the accent is fake, because half the sentence will be in an American accent and the other half a 'Russian' accent. I did enjoy the witty banter between all the members of the Avengers, and surprisingly, even Ultron had some witty dialogue. He is probably the best villain in any of the MCU films. Now, one more thing. I didn't put the 'One does not simply leave a Marvel movie before the end of the credits' meme like I usually do, because there's only one scene after the first 2 minutes of credits, but nothing at the end, so don't wait for the very end of the credits.

La La Land," Robbed of Best Picture
","I can see why this won Best Picture, even if it was only for 30 seconds. This film was fantastic! I'm not usually a fan of live-action musicals, which is why I waited to rent this one, but this was a great movie! Although, it is a little pretentious and narcissitic, but hey, it's an Oscar-nominated film. That's the very definiton. Given that this is the only movie that I've seen Ryan Gosling in, I can't really compare his role in this film to previous works, so for what I got it was great. His singing is pretty good. And now we move to Emma Stone. As far as acting goes, she was fantastic, but her singing ability is average, and at times a bit off key. I've heard better, but I've definietely heard worse. This movie goes into date-night movie territory, but never chick flick territory, thank goodness. (Hey, I'm a guy. I'm not the target audience for those). Overall this was a fun romp, and it deserved every award it was nominated for and won with the exception of Best Costume Design. (What costumes? It's just regular clothes.) The story was pretty good, the chemistry between Gosling and Stone was believable, although sometimes the drama and arguments were a bit overacted, and the choreography and songs were awesome! I am going to be listening to the soundtrack on repeat for a long time. I cannot get these songs out of my head. It's a mix of jazz, pop, funk, a little bit of everything. There's something for everyone to love in this fun musical romp.

Beauty and the Beast," Tale as old as time....yet still somewhat new
","I was extremely skeptical about this movie. I actually thoght the people who saw it opening weekend were suckers. Why would I see a movie that I already own, just with a different cast? Why should I support this extremely blatant cashgrab? But after literally almost everyone I know raving about how amazing and marvelous it was, I finally decided 'Well, I haven't really heard anything bad about it. I'll give it a chance.', and I'm glad I did. This was amazing! Everything from the sets, to the costumes, to the CGI, to the acting was marvelous. I dare say that in some ways it was even better than the original. I try to keep my reviews spoiler free, but unfortunately mild spoilers are needed in this review so I can give specific reasons why I thonk this is superior to the animated one, so if you don't want spoilers stop reading now.
Some complaints that most people had with the animated version were:
'Why does the witch curse the beast when he was a child and was only following stranger danger rules?'
'Why did all the servants get cursed too? They were innocent!'
'Why does everyone turn their nose up at Belle for reading of all things?'Here's what happened. This version makes more sense and that is why I think this one is superior.
It begins with the Beast (as a human) as a young adult and he is at a ball with potential suitors one of whom will be his wife. Big age difference. The line in 'Be Our Guest' changes from 'For 10 years we have been rusting,' to 'For so long we have been rusting.'
The servants were cursed because after the Beast's mom the queen died, his father became cruel and abusive, and the servants got cursed because they just stood by and watched. (Which doesn't make much sense either, but it's better than the 'Because they just happened to be there' reason in the original)
Everyone is a jerk to Belle because they are illilterate, so it doesn't make sense for her to read.The songs were awesome! I had no idea Emma Watson had such an amazing voice. Ewan McGregor still can't do accents, but his singing is still pretty good. Dan Stevens (The Beast) should be on Broadway, because he has some impressive singing chops. Luke Evans (Gaston) doesn't sound brutish enough, which is one aspect where the animated is slightly better, but they made up for that by making him a creepy stalker, so it balances out. Josh Gad....oh boy....well,....he does his typical schtick. I don't like it, but I know what I'm getting. He has one character. He's not good, but I knew what I was getting going in to it. As much as I hate to say it, I'm actually quite excited for the next Disney live action remakes. Are they unneccesary? Yes. Will they be good? Who knows, but if they do what they did here, I think they will be.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Still fun
","The best thing about Marvel is also the worst thing: They always try to outdo themselves with the next film in the MCU. Sometimes it really works like with this film, and Captain America 2 and 3, and sometimes it doesn't like with Iron Man 2 and Thor 2. But the advantage is they know how to keep making it better. They take fan's criticisms and complaints into account and try really hard to fix them. Such is the case with this film. Not that I had anything to complain about with part 1, but man, this definetely beats part 1 by a lot. Everything about this is better. The pacing, the story, the dialouge, the humor, and even the soundtrack. It manages to keep the style, spirit, and tone of everything we loved about the first film while also breaking new ground with it. It's very hard to make lightning strike twice, especially with a film with as weird a premise as Guardians of the Galaxy. By all accounts, the first film shouldn't have worked. Even more so the case with this film. Marvel has managed to do the impossible twice now. This is good, because it proves they're willing to take risks, but this is also bad, because now they'll be forced to outdo themselves every time, until eventually they'll be crushed by their own unattainable expectations. I'm very worried this will happen in the near future, especially as new films come out with new characters and new crossover films. Will we eventually be too greedy and want more and more and bigger and better each time until we're disappointed? I hope not. I know this isn't really a review of the movie, so much as it is about Marvel, but it's getting really had to keep this spoiler-free. Trust me, this is one film where you want to go in knowing as little as possible. Don't read the comics, don't use social media until you've seen the film. And I cannot stress this enough: Do not leave until ALL the credits have finished!!!!.
There is a total of 5 (Yes, FIVE) end credits scenes. And all are important especially as we gear up for Infinity War.

Edge of Tomorrow," Will leave you on the 'Edge'
","I didn't really expect much from this movie. The trailers made me think 'Oh, it's just Tom Cruise playing the same character over and over.' However, after giving this film a chance, I'm glad I saw it. While it felt a bit redundant at times (But I guess that's the point) and started off a bit slow, by the end I was enchanted. This is one movie Hollywood should NOT make a sequel to because this movie would be instantly tainted. This is not your typical sci-fi movie and is actually quite original. It's interesting to see how just one choice can cause a different outcome then a different choice. My one complaint was it wrapped everything up vaguely and too quickly. It feels like there's no ending. I'm not sure if that was intentional or not to keep the main idea of the movie but it felt rushed to me. I did enjoy the strategy concept of this film, and how it felt like it was poking fun at regenerating every time you die in a video game and have to watch the same cutscene every time. I'm pretty sure this was unintentional, but it was genius. I enjoyed this film and it's quite a shame it's considered a box-office flop.

Kong: Skull Island," Kong is the King
","Man, oh man, was this movie fun! While I liked Peter Jackson's version, this definetly blows it out of the water! It's totally epic! I'm surprised this wasn't released in the summer, because it's definely got that summer blockbuster feel. One criticism people had with 2014's 'Godzilla' was that it moved too slowly and took forever for Godzilla to actually show up, and I agree. This fixes that mistake by showing Kong in the opening scene to tide us over, and then doing the buildup. The tone and feel of this movie reminded me of 'Indiana Jones.' It's a fun island survival movie. In my opinion, one thing 'Godzilla' suffered from was the human characters just weren't that interesting. That was not the case here. The characters are written very well, with clear goals and conflicts. The scale of Kong and the island as a whole are impressively huge. Do not watch this movie on your phone. Watch it on the biggest screen possible with an epic sound system for full immersion. Keep in mind the movie, in my opinion, really pushes the PG-13 rating. Some of the violence and deaths can get really brutal. Yet it still manages to balance it out with humor. (Particularly from John C. Reilly's character.) Godzilla had a very dark, bleak, and overall depressing and hopeless tone. (Although those monster fight sequences were awesome!!!!!) This has an action movie tone and is extremely intense at times. Some of the creatures they came up with for the island are really cool, and definetely not stuff I felt I had seen before. It's impressive that a movie that's been remade and redone again and again and again since the 30's still manages to bring something new to the table, while also retaining that classic feel.

The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Basically a video game walkthrough
","There should be an asterisk in the credits after it says 'Based on the book by J.R.R. Tolkien' that says *loosely. The only parts that were in the book was the first 5 minutes. After that it went in an entirely different direction and did its own thing. The whole movie is essentially a 3-hour battle sequence and it looks like you're watching somebody play a video game, and it gets tedious very quickly. That being said, I'm kind of sad that the world of Middle Earth is finished. After 'Hunger Games' ends next year, what other book franchises will there be left to adapt other than 'Maze Runner'? Nothing. It will force Hollywood to think of original ideas for once. Which I guess is a good thing, but at the same time I'm going to miss anticipating these movies and seeing them in a theater with like-minded fans. It's an emotional end to The Hobbit and the world of Middle-Earth and I'm sad to let it go.

Murder on the Orient Express," Ensemble cast makes this brilliant
","This has the potential to be nominated for some serious Oscars. Boasting a star-studded cast and an exciting plot, this promises to be one of the best films of 2017. It diverted some from the book at the beginning, but that was actually a better choice. In the book, I felt I was thrown in without any context, and had to figure out the settings and characters. The movie took its time getting there, in a good way, and it was all the better for it. It established the characters clearly and made it easy to suspect each one of them for different reasons. Although the acting was good, there were still a few moments that fell flat. Johnny Depp's 'New York' accent in particular. It was so obviously fake. And there was one scene where two characters are having a conversation, but one's back is turned to the camera and blurry. I hate that. It distracts, and sometimes makes it hard to follow crucial bits of dialogue, especially when a character's accent is hard to understand. This movie did something I thought would never happen. It made me like Josh Gad. I've been ragging on him for years about how I find him loud and annoying, but here, that doesn't happen. Maybe it's because he's in a more serious role, as opposed to a comedic one. Maybe 'comedy' is his weakness, hence why he feels the need to shout every line but when he's in a serious role such as this one, he's got some serious accting chops. I wasn't blown away by his performance, but I was at least impressed. I'll go into future roles of his with an open mind, because this proves he can be a good actor. There was also some witty dialogue and some of it very sharp and snarky. The book did not have this, and it's a welcome improvement. If you're looking for a movie to make you feel smart and sophisticated, go see this. It's mostly worth it.

The Secret Life of Pets," Perfectly safe family fun
","One critic's review I read said 'It's a beat-for-beat 'Toy Story''. I don't know what movie that critic watched, because I didn't think that at all. It has some similarities in the beginning, but by the 45-minute mark it becomes different enough, and it was clever. There was one scene in a sausage factory that I found particularly hilarious. The film does a great job of capturing the funny, quirky things our pets do. I laugged several times at the hijinks the animals got into, because I've had some of those expereinces myself with my pets. The villain,voiced by Kevin Hart, was one of the best parts. His craziness and over-the-top voice acting made him one of my favorite characters. The animals' love and devotion for their owners was adorable. Overall, I'd say this has been a great year for animation. I rank this up there with 'Kubo' and 'Zootopia.' Will it be nominated for an Oscar? Probably not, but that doesn't mean it's not good. This is definetely worth checking out. My only complaint: It felt too short. I wanted more.

Finding Dory," Better than expected
","My expectations for this were it would be OK at best. From the trailers it looked like a straight rehash of the first movie. Main character gets kidnapped and put in an aquarium and other main character(s) go to look for them. I'm happy to say that it's not like that all. The plot is actually pretty original. Baby Dory is a-Dory-ble. The cutest Pixar baby since Baby Mike Wazowski in 'Monsters University.' The way they showed Dory's backstory leading up to Finding Nemo was done very well. Sometimes too many flashbacks can kill a movie, but these didn't feel forced or excessive. One problem I do have is the writers/director seemed to have forgotten that Marlin learned not to be overprotective at the end of Finding Nemo. He still has some overprotective tendencies. I still say the original is better, but Pixar has made worse. 'The Good Dinosaur' wasn't near the big spectacle it promised to be.

Arrival," Cerebral, original, sci-fi thriller
","This isn't a typical alien movie. The plot is very cerebral. It can be hard to follow at times, because there isn't much segue between scenes. They'll explain something complicated very fast and it doesn't give you much time to process what just happened before they move on to the next thing. It's like that matg teacher who after explaining a complicated concept asks 'Does everyone understand?' and moves on even if only 1 kid said 'Yes.' The plot has a lot of subtle forshadowing, some of which came from supposedly throwaway lines that ended up being important later on. The twist at the end was very well concealed, although I would have liked them to explain the reasons for why this twist can happen. It was brilliant, but came out of nowhere.

","This feels like DC's attempt at recreating Marvel's first Captain America movie. I mean that in a good way. It doesn't feel like a superhero movie. It's more like a mythology/period piece. And we finally have a DC movie with some decent jokes that don't feel out of place because the rest of the movie has such a dark tone. They're not on-par with Marvel's level of wit, but it's pretty dang close. And yes, DC has finally learned: Superhero movies can be fun. The acting was great, except for David Thewlis. I don't know what happened there. He was so good in the 'Harry Potter' movies, but here, he hammed it up a bit too much to the point where it was almost laughable. The action sequences were well done and the score was also great. My only other criticism is the film did move a bit fast in the beginining. The exposition should have been drawn out a bit longer because it was hard for me to transition to the next part of the story that quickly. I'm surprised that so many people liked this. Not because it's a bad film. I enjoyed it too, but because as of late DC has been the scapegoat in the superhero movie game. So if this pleased even a bunch of nitpickers, then you know it's good.

The Wolverine," Improvement over predecessor, but hasn't quite cracked formula
","While it's not the best X-Men movie in the franchise, it's certainly better than X-Men Origins: Wolverine. There was one thing I didn't expect though, humor. I thought it was going to be a dark, gritty film. It is, but they still manage to mix humor. It's not enough, though. I thought the first half moved too slowly, and the second half was over too quickly.
There's one action scene in the first half. One! And it's incredibly fast, and hard to see. The second half had a predictable twist, and left you going 'Really, I knew this was going to happen 20 minutes in the film!' Basically, Wolverine is a fun thrill-ride, but only if you consider rollercoasters that move at 5mph thrill rides. P.S. As always with Marvel movies, stay until about halfway through the credits.

The Croods," Croods is safe
","This movie was a lot better than I expected. Granted, it's not the best Dreamworks movie, but it's still pretty decent. While at times it does feel like Ice Age 3 and The Flintstones, it still has enough originality to pass as an original screenplay. While it probably won't be nominated for Best Animated Film at the Oscars, it has enough heart to be one of the best animated films of the year. Unlike some dull animated films that have come out this year, like Epic, this actually has a good script, fun humor, and a great lesson at it's core. Grade: C, 7/10, 3/5 stars.",7,1,2,30 March 2020
Black Panther," Wakanda Forever!
","This movie was awesome! Black Panther was one of my favorite parts of 'Captain America: Civil War,' and this film shows why. This is 'Batman' meets 'James Bond.' One review I read complained that the film didn't have enough action. I disagree. It had just the right amount. A film doesn't need action every scene to be good, it just needs a good story, and this film delivers. This film gives us the best MCU villain since Loki. He's one of the few villains that I can sympathize with. I'm not justifying his actions, but I get where he's coming from. The technology in this film is really cool. There's one scene in particular that I won't spoil but I thought it would make a great ride at EPCOT. The last 30 minutes alone were worth the price of admission. The final battle is so good and really drew me in! The dialogue is also very well written. This is one of the best films of the MCU. And it's not just a great superhero movie, it's just a great movie. Period.

Iron Man," A solid beginning to the MCU
","A solid beginning to the MCU. At a time where superhero movies, with the exception of the Nolan Batman films were considered box office poison (X-Men 3, Superman Returns, Fantastic Four), the fact that they were making a movie about a B-list character, hiring a washed-up actor nobody wanted to work with in the starring role, getting the director of 'Elf' and releasing it completely independently, this seemed doomed to fail...and yet, somehow, it didn't. The story is pretty solid, though I am not a fan of the character, I do admire it from a filmmaking standpoint. In a time where superhero movies were thought of as a joke, this proved everybody wrong and started something HUGE!

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Ignore the Hate!
","While it is better than 'Man of Steel' (but only slightly), this movie is not without problems of its own. The plot doesn't flow very well, and the film is a bit hard to follow as a consequence of that. I wasn't quite sure what the film was trying to be. And some of the characters' portrayals in this movie feel odd. Lex Luthor feels more like The Joker. However, the action sequences in this movie were impressive. Also, it knew just when to give us mindless action. and when to pause to give us plot. Another thing that made this stand out was they still tell Batman's origin story for those who may not be familiar with it, but it's done in 2 minutes over the opening credits. (Take notes, upcoming Marvel Spider-Man reboot. This is how you should tell the origin.) They also knew when to tease us just enough to get us hyped for the rest of the DC Cinematic Universe films. How, you may ask? No, spoilers. You'll have to see for yourself, but believe me, it's fanservice at its best. Overall, the film doesn't deliver much in terms of plot, but more than delivers on what fans really want to see: Mindless action scenes, and Batman and Superman fighting each other (with some teases for the fans to get them excited for the upcoming films)Grade: B 8/10 3.5/5 stars",8,4,7,30 March 2020
The Greatest Showman," This is the Greatest Show!
","This movie was fantastic! The attention to detail for the time period in which it is set was impressive! The opening logo/credits are in the style of how they were in the 40's. This was a nice little touch that enhanced the film, and it wasn't even a full minute in yet. From that moment, I was pulled into the movie and didn't come back out until the end credits were over. Everything from the costumes, to the acting, to the sets is impressive! One of my complaints was the music seemed too modern for a film set in the 1940s. I would have preferred if they had been more true to the style of the music from that time, and also some parts were very obviously autotuned. The narrative also seemed to be all over the place at points. One of the subplots is started early in the film, and it's not even acknowledged again until the last 20-30. I actually forgot it was a subplot. I did enjoy the musical sequences. Even the slow ones were great because the singing was so impressive. (Except for the occasional 'autotune' at some points.) This felt like a Baz Luhrmann film, and I mean that as a compliment. It even made me like Zendaya. I did not care for her work on the Disney Channel or Spider-Man: Homecoming earlier this year, but she was good in this. The character felt genuine, and that she was actually trying as opposed to her earlier mentioned works where her performance felt phoned in and canned. I was impressed that Zac Efron was able to still sing well, considering he hasn't been in any musicals that I know of since 2008's 'High School Musical 3: Senior Year' which was almost 10 years ago now. I smiled throughout nearly the whole thing, and was intrigued by the story. I definitely enjoyed myself at this one.

Monsters University," Surprisingly fun
","When Pixar announced that they were making another Monsters Inc. I was so excited. A few months later, they said it would be a prequel telling the story of how Mike and Sulley went from enemies to friends, and my hopes fell. I mean, we see that they're friends, and have been for a long time, so can we just have a sequel where maybe they need Boo's help? We want more Boo! Then the trailers came out and my hopes were restored. 'This could actually be really good,' I thought. I decided to give it a chance and I'm glad I did! It's funny, creepy, and has a lot of heart, and references to the original movie are abundant. (And yes, despite this being a prequel they did manage to have John Ratsenburger as The Abominable Snowman. Don't get too excited, though. He only has one line, but it's a funny line.)

Saving Mr. Banks," Awards season!
","Definitely think this is going to be nominated for a few awards this season. Tom Hanks is the perfect choice for Walt Disney, and Emma Thompson comes off as both snarky and funny at the same time. While at times it is a little dark, it has plenty of humor to make up for it. But considering that both this and Mary Poppins are both Disney I'm not sure we're getting all the facts here. But they really went all out in making everything and everyone look and dress like they were living in the early 60's. If this isn't nominated for at least one award, I've lost faith in the Academy.Grade: A+ 10/10 5/5 stars",10,0,2,30 March 2020
Thor: The Dark World," Thor just ain't that magical
","While it's not the best of the Marvel movies, it's still pretty fun. Loki has a bigger part and 90% of the movie takes place on Asgard. The sets are just amazing. While the opening sequence and most of the movie feels like Lord of the Rings in both cinematography and plot, that's not necessarily a bad thing.It definitely helps with the mythology elements of the film. The plot is a bit slow, though.

Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Force brings a new hope
","The first line in this movie is 'This will begin to make things right.' I feel like that's a jab at the prequels. 'Hey, we know the prequels were awful, but this new movie will begin to make things right.' Probably not intentional, but clever nonetheless. My goodness, this movie is so well done! The parallels and metaphors are so cleverly written. Even if you haven't seen any Star Wars movies before, you can watch this as a standalone. Will you get more out of it if you've seen the original trilogy? Of course. Is it essential viewing before going into this one? No. The plot does at times feel 'Been there, seen that,' because it is essentially a remake of A New Hope. However, there's enough new bits in the story that left me satisfied. The practical effects are so well done, and the very little CGI in the movie looks more realistic than the prequels ever did. There's an important message in the movie, and the characters are relatable. Unlike some of the characters in the prequels, you care about what happens to these new characters. They're acting is great, and the classic actors still feel like their characters. Harrison Ford is still great with the zingers, and C-3PO is still the worrisome robot we all love. J. J. Abrams has restored what we all love about Star Wars. Even before the classic characters show up, it still feels like a Star Wars movie. If the upcoming films are even 1/4 as good as this was, there's a new hope for the Star Wars franchise.

Unbroken," Robbed at the Oscars!
","Why, Academy? Why didn't you nominate this for anything? This movie was amazing, and if I had seen it before 2014 ended it would have been on my top 10 list for sure. Jack O'Connell did a phenomenal job as Louis Zamperini, and rivals Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of Alan Turing in 'The Imitation Game.' I can't decide whose acting I liked better. I felt a range of emotion watching this film that I haven't felt in a long time. I was actually yelling at the screen at Takamasa Ishihara who plays Col. Watanabe, the antagonist of the film, because he felt genuinely evil. I wanted to reach through the screen and punch him in the face. This is such a powerful film, and it's a shame it wasn't nominated. I was so amazed at the hardships Louis had to endure, and genuinely felt for him. Everything about this film is amazing. The acting, the writing, even the score. There's something very unusual about this film that was a pleasant surprise to see. Religion is a key factor to the films plot, and it isn't mocked. That's something we need in more films. It's a shame that the real Louis Zamperini passed away before this film was released. I'm sure he'd be proud. This is one of those films that you absolutely must see before you die. It's so inspiring, and puts everything in perspective. Bravo, Angelina Jolie.

The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Higher stakes, better plot
","It's much darker than the first film, and the games are more exciting. Some people said the beginning was boring, but that's how the first one was too. I'd rather they have good plot development rather then just rushing to get to the action. It's the character development and dialogue that fuels plot. They chose an actor for Finnick who looked just like his description in the book. And yes, people in the Capitol like to dress crazy in this as well. Even though there was little to no humor in the book, the film managed to have some very funny lines. (Mostly from Effie Trinkit and Haymitch)

Godzilla," Run! It's Godzilla!
","While the first 2/3 are boring and spend too much time 'developing the story' it picks up by the 3rd act.
Last year's Pacific Rim was a fun entertaining experience, and this is no different. Something very rare happened at my screening. Everyone was cheering. The only other time that's happened was at the 'Doctor Who' 50th anniversary movie. The beginning is slow, but by the end of the film, so much awesome stuff has happened that it's forgivable. This film is not cheesy like the originals. It's incredibly well done and I wouldn't be surprised if we got a Pacific Rim/Godzilla crossover. (Make it happen Warner Brothers!) This is a very exciting, fun movie. There are a couple of jump scares however, so if that's not your thing, rent it. For the rest of you however, I highly recommend seeing it in the theater. Just like Pacific Rim, it's a BIG movie, that you have to see on a giant screen. The acting in the movie is somewhat flat, but if you're in it for the monster mayhem, it's easy to forget about the average acting. There are a few unneccessary conversations that drag the plot out, but by the time Godzilla appears, all is forgiven. It's a big monster showdown movie that's incredibly awesome. In summary, Godzilla is a fun time at the movies.

Minions," Fun heist
","I'm kind of surprised that this was as good as at was. Considering the Minions don't speak English, I thought it wouldn't really work as a full length movie if most of it was in Minion-ese. However, it does work and somehow you can understand what they're saying perfectly. This is an absolutely hilarious film. I'd say it's one of the best of the year! It's even got references to the original 'Despicable Me' movie. Most of the humor is visual, rather than from the writing. It was great seeing everything tie in from this prequel to the original movie. It helps explain some things. Although it took away my theory that Gru created the Minions, their real origin is no more ridiculous than mine. It's fun for the whole family, and I look forward to 'Despicable Me 3.' I need more Minions, and I need them now.Grade: A+. 10/10. 5/5 stars",10,1,2,30 March 2020
Incredibles 2," I waited 14 years for this?!
","Although the plot is not as good as the first one, it is still worth the 14 year wait. The first half could have been improved immensely though, because for the first hour or so it feels like a gender-swapped rehash of the first one, and plays more like a direct-to-video sequel like the ones Disney used to put out. The first half still has its moments though, particularity the ones with Jack-Jack and the trouble he gets into. A lot of the humor in the first half does come from those scenes, and is more visual based. After the first hour, the plot definitely picks up and reaches a satisfying conclusion. There is still plenty of great action, and the villain, while not as good as Syndrome from the first movie, does deliver a pretty great monologue that makes you think for a moment that their goal isn't so bad, but simply the methods they are using to reach that goal. When it finally is revealed who the villain is though, it does feel stolen from a certain Marvel movie that shall remain unnamed so as to avoid spoilers. The animation is still gorgeous, (though the character of a newscaster does look like an animated caricature like the ones you would get drawn of yourself at a carnival and he just looks creepy), and some of the best voice acting is from Bob Odenkirk. He is one of the best characters in the film. It is disappointing that the film, in terms of plot and character development, had to take a bit of a step backward. What made the first film so unique was seeing the family dynamic and the family using their powers to help each other out. Here, we get very little of that. It has the typical 'The dad is stupid and hapless and needs the mom to fix all his mistakes, har dee har' stuff that's done to death in just about every sitcom on tv, and that's disappointing, especially from a so-called 'family' company like Disney. Haven't we as a society moved past this? In a world where everyone is crying for 'equal rights and representation', shouldn't we get true equality? Equality does not mean superiority at the so-called 'privileged' individual or party's expense,and that's disappointing to see here. It also had some unnecessary (albeit mild) profanity, which was also disappointing. (Again, 'family' company) Overall, it is worth seeing. Just don't expect it to be as thrilling as the first one.

Spectre," Lock your doors. Watch out for...007!
","I need to give compliment to the cinematographer, because the first 3 minutes of this movie are one big long pan shot. That's impressive. I say even if you've never had interest in a James Bond movie before, but you are a fan of BBC's Sherlock (particularly Andrew Scott who plays Moriarty in that series) then see it for his acting, because he is awesome in this movie. Andrew Scott plays villains very well. That's not to say that Daniel Craig does a terrible job of playing Bond. He did a great job with his character as well. He had some witty lines(in fact, most characters did), and the action sequences were well done. Keep in mind the only other James Bond film I've seen is 'Skyfall', so my opinion is based only on having seen that one other movie. The main plot didn't really have much, but there was a good food-for-thought subplot about global government surveillance that I thought was interesting. The car chase scenes were a little over-the-top and ridiculous, (There's no way his car should be driving up that curve.) but they were still fun. It's a little hard to keep track of what's going on, because there's lots of characters and subplots that are confusing. Is this one of the best films of 2015? No, but it is enjoyable.

Warcraft," Turn off your brain
","Listen, this isn't going to be 'Lord of the Rings.' It does have some similarities, but overall, it feels like its own thing. Keep in mind that prior to viewing this movie, I knew absolutely nothing about the World of Warcraft, so I can't say how true it is to the source material. But judging it on its own merit, I found it surprisingly entertaining. The battle sequences are huge (although one problem is they do tend to drag on a bit too long), the plot was surprisingly thought-provoking, and the scenery and the CGI are just so beautifully done. The Orcs have so much detail put into them, that for the most part the line between real and CGI is blurred. (However, this is just when the Orcs are in scenes by themselves. When they're with human characters, the CGI tends to look a bit faker.) There are some elements that are very obviously 'borrowed' from Tolkien's work, but overall I thought it was a fun movie. It does have some of the cliches that are in every fantasy movie, but they're few. The battle sequences are just brutal! The death toll and the emotion in the battles really make you feel for the characters, whether they be human or Orc. There are heroes and villains on both sides of the conflict. and it doesn't matter which side you root for, because without giving anything away, I will say the film doesn't really have a resolution to the conflict, which left me feeling empty. I know they did this because they think it's going to be a trilogy (or more), but sadly I doubt this will get one. That's something I thought I'd never say. I want this story to continue. I want to see more of these characters and world. I won't play any of the games because on the 0.000001% chance this does end up getting a series of films, I want to judge them on their own merit, just as I did this one. It's only fair.

The Martian," One of Ridley Scott's best
","I was a bit skeptical with this movie going in, because of how everyone was raving about it. 'You gotta see The Martian. You gotta see The Martian.' Usually when people tell me over and over how great a film is, my expectations get a bit too high and I end up thinking the film is just OK. (This happened with 'Avatar' and 'Gravity.') I'm happy to say that this was one of the few times where I actually agree. This movie was amazing. The problem with 'Gravity' and 'Avatar' for me was they weren't really that engaging. This film was. I was excited to see what what happened next. There was even a point where I paused for a lunch break, and tried to make it as quick as possible so I could see what happened next. Matt Damon is great in this. He makes you feel such levels of emotion. This definitely deserves every Oscar it gets. I'm rooting for this to bring home the gold this coming Sunday. Everything from the acting, to the cinematography, to the script is brilliant. There were one or two scenes that made me a bit squeamish, so if those scenes weren't in there this would be an A+, but they were, so as you can see, I gave this an A-. But considering how much everyone raved about this, I'm glad I didn't end up thinking this was overrated.Grade: A-, 9/10 4/5 stars",9,0,2,30 March 2020
