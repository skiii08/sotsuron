Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Only for broad-minded individuals willing to look in the mirror and laugh
","I think the reason this movie has been so polarizing, is because it is so in-your-face. The reason Cohen is so rude is to get reactions, either from the unwitting participants in this masterpiece, or from us the audience.If you are not prepared to look at yourself and ask yourself what your reaction would be to scenes in the movie (and possibly learn, god forbid), then don't watch it. Rather go and get yourself a traditional American comedy that won't challenge your flimsy beliefs.By the way, it is not an assault on any particular culture, it is an assault on various weak points in many cultures (and your abdominal muscles).This is purely brilliant, out-of-the-box thinking from a very intelligent and brave comic.10/10 red-hot chillies.Is nice, I like, High five!",8,2,4,20 August 2008
The Illusionist," Very few movies even make my shortlist. This one got into my collection without even being on the shortlist!
","If you go into this movie expecting a wonderfully original storyline, you'll be missing the point.The basic plot is the simple period piece, which is still used because it works, even though we've all seen it before (Yawn). However, combine the period piece with another old favourite, the mystery, and you have the potential for an Oscar, which I honestly believe this movie deserves.I respected Ed Norton before The Illusionist, now he's one of my favourite actors. He seems comfortable in any role thrown at him (Think Fight Club, then watch this.) Jessica Biel backed up her beauty with some truly accomplished acting, Paul Giamatti gave the chief inspectors internal struggle depth and realism, while Rufus Sewell almost became the ruthless Prince Leopold.I loved this movie. It made me cry, it made me laugh and it reminded me to tell my wife how much I love her. The effects, even though computer generated and not illusions, were wonderful and somehow still managed to retain some of that old-world feel. The cinematography weaves a wonderful tapestry all around you, while creating a visual masterpiece (of course, Jessica Biel always helps...)Period films, as a general rule, are not my favourites - maybe because there are many mediocre ones out there - but the mystery and romance embroidered into The Illusionist helped it work its way into my heart, and my small DVD collection.Forget the nay-sayers, just watch (and love) this movie.",9,1,2,25 December 2007
