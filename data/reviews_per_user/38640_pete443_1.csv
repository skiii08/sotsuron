Catch Me If You Can," I was absorbed
","My first and only criterion for enjoying a film is whether I'm absorbed. To the point where I don't think about time and think like the characters and consider them real.  A fairly simple yet powerful measure.This film abosorbed me.  A fascinating plot, very good acting, and even though we know the ending, suspense.  It helps not to know before exactly what fields the fake entered, just to add a little more.  A plain, good ole entertaining movie in the best spirit of Hollywood.  I suppose uppity types won't be impressed, since it lacks the weirdness so many critics seem to crave in 'critically acclaimed' movies.Bottom line: was the ticket worth it, was the time well spent?  A resounding yes.  Highly entertaining.",10,1,2,18 January 2003
