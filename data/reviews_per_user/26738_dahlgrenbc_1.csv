First Man," Great true story, badly told...
","Many things about this movie had me rolling my eyes...Worst was that it is poorly edited...it needed more editing and should've had been shorter. All that gazing into the middle distance, to indicate deep thought, was not real effective. We get it! He's nervous! She's nervous! they're nervous!The bracelet thing was telegraphed, as if the movie were intended for an audience of 10-year-olds. It was SO overdone.The handheld camera thing is so tiresome, it should be put to bed NOW. I think we are grown-up enough that we don't need a wobbly camera to tell us it is real life we are looking at.Last but not least, why do movies nowadays have to hold the credits till the end of the movie? They should be at the beginning, like they used to!",5,0,0,5 April 2019
