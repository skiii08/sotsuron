The Devil's Advocate," Superb execution and acting
",The film has a fantastic star cast. Keanu Reeves plays his role very well. The scene sealer however is AL Pacino. Charlize Theron looks adorable and hot. I was just having a discussion with a friend about choosing between Robert De Niro and AL Pacino and I came to a conclusion that AL Pacino makes every performance more grand. He definitely has an edge over every actor in this generation. He is a class apart.He has fantastic style and he delivers simple lines with such a punch that they become iconic moments. In every frame here he convinces you that he is Satan. He gives the role the edge it needed and his performance makes this movie supreme. The direction is impeccable. The script and dialogue are fantastic. The visuals are stunning and I am glad that they did not spoil this to make it a commercial horror movie.,10,1,1,4 December 2017
Blade Runner 2049," Brilliant Sequel
","Sequels made after a long gap are usually not up to the mark. Blade Runner 2049 gets it right. It has style and substance. The more I see of Ryan Gosling , the more I like him. Harrison Ford cameo was brilliant too. Jared Leto perfects his act. The supporting cast is brilliant. The special effects are mindblowing. A great movie watching experience.",10,1,14,14 June 2019
Changeling," Fantastic
",This movie is very well directed. Clint Eastwood successfully narrates the story and depicts that era on the screen beautifully. Angelina Jolie looks beautiful and emotes superbly. She does justice to her role and her character looks from that era. The supporting cast is flawless and the casting is impeccable. A very well made film,10,3,5,20 November 2017
Source Code," Great Concept and Brilliant Performances
",Jake Gyllenhaal looks the part and acts really well.. Vera Farmiga looks gorgeous and Michelle Monaghan looks extremely beautiful. The concept of the movie is very original and the execution of the original idea is perfect here.. Jeffery Wright is another class actor. I was blown away by the film's premise and although a bit far fetched but it was extremely entertaining,9,0,0,18 May 2018
The Ring," Perfect Scary Movie
","It is well made. The movie is perfectly scary. But I have seen so many horror movies where the jump-scare of the real revelation of the ghost kills it. Naomi Watts has acted well. The depiction of the ghost is good. The child playing the role has done well. But somehow the back story reveal is not up to the mark. If the back story was made better and spookier I would have given it a 10. Disclaimer, I have not seen the Original so that I do not end up comparing the two.",8,0,1,29 October 2017
Hereditary," Spine Chilling Horror
",I am a huge fan of this genre and I watch all kinds of Horror movies. I have seen so much horror that I have become immune to horror movies now. Ordinary scares do not unnerve me anymore. This movie has a slow burn and it is boring in the first 30 min. But when it gets going it is really spooky. The performances of all actors are brilliant. The eerie atmosphere adds to it and the background score is fabulous. This will definitely scare you,10,0,3,10 April 2019
Unbreakable," it's a slow burn
",The performances are commendable. Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson are brilliant in their roles. The plot and the screenplay is perfect and leaves you with an impact. But it starts off very slow. The hero is too reluctant to begin with and the villain is too brilliant.,8,0,0,23 November 2019
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Very Entertaining
",Ryan Gosling has style and charm. Steve Carell has fabolous comic timing. This is a comparatively more serious role for Carell. He does well in the comic scenes and does even better in the emotional scenes. His dialouge delivery is apt. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone set the screen on fire with their chemistry. The writing is crisp and witty. The characters are very relatable and uplifting. A good movie to watch and feel good about yourself and LOVE,9,1,2,21 May 2019
The Irishman," This is a masterpiece
",Martin Scorcese directs his epic masterpiece with a stellar starcast of veteran stalwarts. He does a brilliant job in giving them the perfect roles. Robert De Niro shines in his usual subdued subtle performance as a cool headed gangster. Al Pacino outshines them all with his brilliant performance as Jimmy Hoffa. He acts flawlessly. Joe Pesci is back from retirement and I love watching this man on screen. This movie has pesci in a more serious and sinister role. He does not go about with his usual whacky mischievous self.,10,3,7,8 December 2019
Home Alone," The Perfect Holiday Movie
",This is the perfect holiday movie to watch with the family. It has fantastic funny moments and genuine emotional moments. The Acting is superb and the direction is perfect. The movie is very smartly executed. Joe Pesci is hilarious in this avatar.The boy who is accidentally left home alone is very well enacted by Mac. The movie has the moral that family is important and that we cannot live without our irritating families,10,1,2,26 December 2017
Aquaman," Too much CGI
",The movie looks like an animation film. There is too much CGI and everything looks like Computer graphics. No scene looks believable or real. A flying superman or a batman with superhuman strength looked believable. But these underwater fights are a caricature of special effects and this kind of cinema.,5,1,1,13 May 2019
Knocked Up," It is funny
","There are some genuinely funny scenes. Seth Rogen, Jason Segel and Jonah Hill are simply hilarious. Kathereine Heigi looks gorgeous and plays her character beautifully. The overall film is a very smart film. The Jokes are not gross. This is a nice comedy film",8,0,0,28 April 2018
Forrest Gump," Brilliant from the beginning to the end
",It is a flawless film. Every scene has been well thought before filming and the execution is perfect. Robin Wright plays the layered character effortlessly. Tom Hanks is awesome and I am sure that no one else could have Forrest Gump like him. He runs and talks in a beautiful way. You devolop a liking for this character almost immediately. While telling the story of Forrest Gump this movie also tells us the story of United States of America and pays tribute to the most celebrated celebrities and heroes of those times.,10,1,1,21 December 2017
Gone Baby Gone," Flawless and Beautiful
",This movie is flawless and beautiful. The actors give fantastic performances. Casey Affleck looks good and acts really well and so does all the supporting cast. The suspense unfolds beautifully and there is a lot of thrill in what suddenly unfolds. The movie impacts you and makes you think about parenthood. Are we doing justice to our kids ? The movie talks about a selfish generation that is not ready for responsibilities. The movie asks the audience all the relevant questions.,9,1,2,5 October 2017
Bird Box," Lots of thrills
",This film does what it intends to do. The trailers show you a glimpse of the tension and then the tension ensues. You enjoy the dark nature of the film. Sandra Bullock does justice to her role once again. Sara Paulson makes a nice cameo and John Malkovich is brilliant in his small role,9,2,3,23 May 2019
The Bourne Identity," Fast-paced and brilliant
",The movie starts off dramatically. You are with the protagonist as his story unfolds. He does not remember who he is. You can just figure out that he is something special when he beats cops effortlessly. Escapes from buildings and drives at erratic speeds without getting hurt. Matt Damon essays the author backed role to the T. He is perfect in every scene. It keeps you on the edge throughout although I was a bit disappointed with the climax,9,0,0,24 April 2019
The Revenant," It is not a movie ; it is an Experience
",A Fantastic experience beautifully captured. Leonardo performs brilliantly. He emotes fantastically. The film explores his journey with finesse. Tom Hardy gives a rock solid performance. The dream sequences and flashbacks are shown with great intensity. The film is a bit slow and you need a lot of patience to sit through the gruesome scenes. Definitely not for the faint hearted,9,0,0,27 August 2017
Van Helsing," Stylish but Cartoonish . Not deep
",This is an action adventure horror thriller. Van Helsing is the stylish vampire hunter. Hugh Jackman has very little to do here apart from looking good and saying one-liners. The movie has too much action and a very loud background score. The background score and the yells from the demonic characters get irritating after the point. It does not scare you and the CGI looked very cartoonish to me. It did not look real at all. It did not convince me to believe in the storyline and I kept watching a CGI led action fest on screen and got bored terribly towards the end. I was waiting for the movie to get over,7,1,1,24 April 2019
Avengers: Endgame," A superhero film with Drama, Action, Comedy and Emotions
",This is a complete film that completes a Phase of 22 films. The Marvel Universe gets a closure to the Infinity Saga. The film couldn't be more better. it is simply flawless . It is an experience. Just go and watch it and enjoy,10,0,3,6 May 2019
The Butterfly Effect," Awesome
",This movie is not predictable and you remain at the edge of your seat throughout. The Ending could have been better. It was not a very realistic ending to such a high octane film. The performances by lead actors are brilliant. The special effects are mind blowing. The winning factor for the film is the pace of the proceedings.,9,0,0,27 August 2017
It Follows," Wasn't as good as i expected
",Watchmojo lists always include this movie in one of the best horror movies and hence I was propelled to watch it. It follows didn't make me feel scared but it was a decent film with a new concept. It wasn't a great movie but it did what most horror movies do. The teens look gorgeous but the sex scenes are plain silly. The solution at the end is really silly too. But most horror movies have a silly premise. I do not believe in ghosts hence exorcisms look silly to me too.,7,0,1,24 March 2020
Avengers: Infinity War," Thanos is the best supervillain
","Marvel supervillains have been laughing stock . Be it Loki or Ultron, they have looked easily defeatable. Thanos looks invincible and deadly. Great movie",9,1,1,6 May 2019
Drive," Mesmerizing
",It is mesmerizing. Ryan Gosling looks so adorable and acts so well. Every expression of his is spot on. Carey Mulligan looks beautiful and the chemistry between the two is beautiful. The Action is brilliantly shot.The movie has a neo noirish feel to it and that makes the movie more awesome,9,3,4,18 November 2018
X-Men: The Last Stand," A Nice Entertaining Film
",Great on Special effects but slightly low on content. The Climax is filled with too much action. It did not do justice to the previous two films of the franchise. I am still to watch the Four other films that were made after this. In this part I enjoyed the character of the Beast. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine played his part well. Famke Jensen had a the most fantastic role with grey shades. Mystique ended too early and left me disappointed. But this franchise is purely entertainment. I love watching it again and again.,9,1,1,10 September 2017
A Quiet Place," Great Experience
","I am a huge horror movie fan. However i was getting tired of the same kind of stories. A possessed protagonist and a back story. This one made my heart jump. The concept is brilliant and the execution even more brilliant. There is little dialouge . This movie has only great moments , expressions and shocking jumpscares. It is like a roller coaster. Go have your share of breathtaking fun",9,2,6,14 May 2018
Uri: The Surgical Strike," Patriotism done right
","This film does not give you a patriotism overdose . They have done with the emotional and slightly cheesy line of Suniel Shetty Yeh Dharti Meri Maa Hai from Border. Vicky Kaushal gives you a new and strong Army officer to cheer for. He is brilliant in this role. Mohit Raina provides great support in a very short role. Paresh Rawal is undeniably cool and says some of the greatest lines in the movies like yeh naya hindustan hai, Andar ghus ke marega... Yami Gautam looks pretty and plays her role really well. The casting is impeccable. Rajit Kapur's Potrayal of PM Narendra Modi in this movie is far more convincing than Vivek Oberoi in the biopic of the same name.",10,0,0,11 June 2019
Men in Black," Will Smith Rocks
",The movie has beautiful scenes. It has great humor throughout. The Aliens should have been a little less gross. Apart from that every scene is beautifully done. Will Smith makes you root for the MEN IN BLACK. They look smart and carry extraordinary weapons. The Aliens are brilliantly made.,8,0,0,27 June 2019
Mama," Great Special Effects and Story
",The Kids are superb. They look extremely cute and give out exemplary performances. Jessica Chastain looks hot and acts well. The special effects are fabolous. The back story and the jump scares are flawless. It is a very well made horror film with a heart,9,0,0,29 March 2018
The Witch," Good Movie but could have been better
",I personally do not enjoy slow paced horror movies. The Movie needs to have tension throughout and the events need to occur faster than you expect. The Movie has a breath-taking ending. It really leaves you with an impact. But you need to go through a lot of slow scenes where nothing much happens.The Acting is fantastic.. Anya Taylor-Joy looks awesome and acts well.,7,0,1,13 August 2017
It Chapter Two," Gets the Traditional jumpscares right
",It is a horror movie . There is no deep message here and no subtle hints. It's great with the Jumpscares and special effects. It is scary and hilarious at the same time.,10,0,3,9 April 2020
Shooter," Stylish and thrilling
",Mark Wahlberg does well . He looks good and acts well .Kate Mara looks steaming hot. Micheal Pena does well in his role. The style has the X factor .Dialouges are witty and cool. It is an intelligent conspiracy film with lots of cool action and a sexy Kate Mara,9,0,0,9 February 2019
Murder on the Orient Express," Kenneth Branaugh Steals the show
",He brings Hercule Poirot to life. The character of the detective has been essayed so brilliantly. There is a fantastic starcast. Michelle Pfiffer plays an important role and does really well. The Script is good and the movie works a good pace. I enjoyed the thrill,9,0,1,2 May 2018
Parasite," Keeps you engaged. A humorous thrill ride
",I couldn't help but laugh at the gullible rich family when the poor underdogs manipulated them and got jobs in their house. The second half is a great thriller. The movie has many twists that will leave you baffled. I don't want to spoil it for you. It is a must watch .,10,1,2,13 April 2020
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Beautifully expressed
","Micheal Keaton steals the show. It is a beautiful satire. Hollywood is explored and the shallowness of the life of celebrities is explored beautifully. The dialouge has been written beautifully. Emma Stone, Naomi Watts and Edward Norton play supporting roles very well. It is the emotional journey of a commercially successful actor who is struggling to become an artist",9,1,1,9 May 2019
Wonder Woman," Boring in parts. Excellent at times
","The story is fast paced and full of action. But you expect a lot of special effects and strong villains in a superhero movie. This film has its share of moments . Gal Gadot looks really beautiful, stunning and hot. But the other actors are hence forced to play second fiddle. Danny Huston has a very small screen time and hence he cannot entice you in his menacing avatar. David Thewlis does not convince me as the baddie. It could be my perception but I like to see a strong villain battling a strong superhero. The suspense was laid out well.",8,3,8,22 October 2017
Iron Man," Awesome Visual Spectacle
",Robert Downey Jr was born to do this role. The witty lines he delivers make the character so lovable. He has this quality that you instantly start liking him. When he wears the suit and starts flying ; he creates a thundering effect on you. I jumped and whistled to his adventures. Marvel universe is truly fantabolous and it is incomplete without Iron Man.,10,0,1,25 October 2017
Mother!," Poetry in motion
","I did not understand the film in the first go since I am an atheist and I was unaware of the stories from the bible.
When I understood the director's vision I fell in awe with the story and the characters. The horrors of humanity are showcased so beautifully. The shots are awe-inspiring and Jennifer Lawrence steals the show.
This is what we have done to mother nature and as an atheist I enjoyed the part the creator is a mere spectator and he cannot do much",10,0,2,16 April 2018
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Beautiful take on temptations
","Relationships are complicated because we as humans always want something better. We are tempted to a younger man/woman or a sexier individual and we lose the spark in an existing relationship. We are all looking for adventure and fun. We are all bigamous creatures that pretend to be happy in a monotonous relationship. Beautifully showcased by Woody Allen. Brilliant performances by Zavier Bardern, Rebecca Hall, Penelope Cruz and Scarlett Johannson.",9,0,0,17 September 2018
The Truman Show," Reality TV
",I have never been a fan of reality TV. On television real emotions and real behaviour is not possible. You can only be real to an extent because you know that the whole world is watching you. In Truman Show ; Truman is unaware and hence he is real. Jim Carrey gives a fantastic performance. Ed harris looks fantastic and acts very well. The film is a thinking man's film. It shows the human psyche of trying to go beyond boundaries. It is beautifully made film.,10,0,0,2 July 2018
Joy," Works because of Jennifer Lawrence
",Joy is the story of a strong woman that fights against all odds and wins. The success story of an underdog has been done to death. Joy works because it is a real story and it works because it has Jennifer Lawrence in it. It is the story of a woman that believes in her dream and does everything she can to make it possible. Joy inspires people to follow their dream. Her story helps those people who are slightly scared to take a leap. She comes across as identifiable. Jennifer Lawrence does a great job as a common woman and she looks gorgeous.,8,8,15,30 November 2017
Jurassic Park," A Flawless Masterpiece
",This movie has no flaws. It is directed beautifully. It shows us realistic dinosaurs and they look so real that they take your breath away. It is the most original concept with a flawless storyline and some epic performances.,10,1,1,17 September 2018
The Godfather," Simply magnificent
","This is a brilliant film. This has absolutely no flaw. The story is narrated perfectly and the thrill grows with each scene. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino have played their roles so perfectly that you end up mesmerized by their act. A Textbook for all actors, writers and directors.",10,0,0,3 October 2017
