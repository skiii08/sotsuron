The Rock," Good Action!!!
","The Rock is Nick Cage's best action film. The characters have moral integrity (especially Ed Harris') and this gave them depth. Sean Connery simply snaps, crackles and pops in this movie. The action doesn't stop though the multiple views work and slow motion bits do wear thin. But this movie has it all!",7,2,2,30 September 1998
JFK," Well crafted suspense
","In JFK, Oliver Stone shows how important editing is to a film. Through a relentless collage of black and white and color footage, 35 millimeter film and photographs, he skillfully weaves his conspiracy story. The facts could have been overwhelming and confusing in their profusion, but Stone places them all deftly into the sequence of events.There are many familiar faces in this movie, but they are almost unrecognisable. They become their characters. The performances throughout JFK are good and realistic and the suspense and drama that binds the whole tale results in an excellent courtroom piece. JFK is truly fantastic film making.",9,2,13,16 October 1998
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Should be renamed Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula
","This movie almost follows the novel. The count comes to England and is then chased back home. In addition there is the love story which is well done and truly touching. The sets and costumes are marvellous and those alone make the movie woth seeing.But except for Jonathon Harker's interactions with the count at the castle, this movie is not scary. Gary Oldman is scary as the old count and he makes the film. But the rest of the movie is mystery and eroticism and there is little horror involved.The characters are also somewhat different than as written. Mina Harker and Lucy Westenra are apparently nymphomaniacs. Van Helsing has been written down to nothing more than a talkative perverted  Dutchman. Thank God Renfield has been left untampered.If you have to see this film, expect to be somewhat scared for the first forty minutes and awed by the ambience of the film throughout. But this is not Bram Stoker's Dracula. That Irishman would have never written characters like the ones in this film.",6,1,2,30 September 1998
Die Hard with a Vengeance," A great action movie
",Die Hard 3 works so well for me because it seems to be realistic and not so fantastic as Face Off and those kinds of movies. The action is tremendous and non stop. I think that putting Sam Jackson and Jeremy Irons in the movie was a stroke of genius.The movie is intense and exciting from the first minute right to the last - wall to wall non-stop action. This is a must see for any action fan. I think it is the best of the series.,8,1,1,30 September 1998
The Shawshank Redemption," Simple, powerful and a masterpiece
","This movie is absolutely superb. You watch it and all the simple, unremarkable details just cumulate and you realise that this movie, by being unflashy and ordinary is telling a powerful story about hope and redemption. Andy seems to be the main character but it is Red who finds himself, who is redeemed.The Shawshank Redemption was overlooked because it looked unremarkable. But this movie has to be seen. My friends are action movie fanatics but they were all stunned by this movie. Stephen King should be thanked for writing the novella and the director should be praised for bringing it to the screen in such fine form. Forget Forrest Gump, this was the Best Picture of 1994.",10,0,0,16 November 1998
