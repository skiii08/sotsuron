Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A gorgeous, elegant prequel that fits perfectly into the Star Wars universe
",Just saw it again and it works even better the second and third time around. Don't listen to critics they're just blocked artists.  Episode One stands on its own and works just as well as Episodes 4-6.And that lightsaber duel... WOW!,9,0,0,6 June 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," For those disappointed by Episode I...
","... this should appease you.  It did for me.  Forget the mainstream critics, they're all on a trendy Lucas-bashing binge and have never truly gotten what the films encapsulate.   Is Ep. II perfect?  No.  The romance is clunky and ludicrous but it's still a thrilling, elegant fantasy that's right behind Episode IV and V as the best of the SW epics.  I bow to Master Yoda!",9,0,0,18 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A Wonderful Film.
",New Line Cinema should be tossing rose petals at Peter Jackson's feet.  A great piece of filmmaking that still lingers in my mind.  Compare it to the sterile 'Star Wars:  Episode One' and the achievement is all the better.  I can't wait to see it again.  It's the best of the year.,10,0,0,20 December 2001
Pearl Harbor," Save your money, rent the video
","The bombing doesn't disappointment.  The special effects are excellent, it's pretty exciting, well-staged, etc.  That sequence lasts about 30 minutes. The other 2 and 1/2 hours which centers on love triangle between Affleck, Hartnett and Beckinsale is dull, totally ridiculous and quite difficult to sit through.  Two young women sitting behind me were frequently doubled over with laughter.  Though the characters frequently cry and laugh and kiss, I felt completely disconnected from them.  And Affleck sports a terrible Southern (!) accent, unlike anything I've heard before.  It's such a cliche-ridden mess.  You'll be rolling your eyes and laughing out loud at scene after scene.  Shame, really.  It could have been great.",1,0,0,11 June 2001
