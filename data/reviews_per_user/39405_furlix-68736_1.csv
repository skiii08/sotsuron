It," Don't listen to the negative reviews
",Everyone's a critic these Days!This is a fun and faithful adaptation of Stephen King's book 'IT' I can't understand why people are complaining and saying save your money.Please do not listen to these reviews make up your own mind.The leaper was not CGI it was practical effects! They used CGI for pennywise because there is no way some of those effects could be done practically .Pennywise actor Bill skarsgard could roll his eyes and move them without CGI as stated in interviews! His eye colour changed from yellow to blue to lewer Georgie in.I will also add that the story works even with the minor changes.Please people don't be a sheep in the heard and follow the negative Nancy's in the world. This film is fun and the story is told well. Sure the scares aren't that scary but the psychological atmosphere in this story is!Its a 10/10 for me!,10,5,10,14 September 2017
