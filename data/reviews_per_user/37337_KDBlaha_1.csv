Miracle," Amazing Movie
",Miracle is the MOST AMAZING movie i have ever seen!!! Not just because it has AMAZINGLY HOT hockey boys in it and you cannot go wrong in liking hockey boys...but I love to watch hockey and it's just a great sport to watch. It's great that this movie is also based on a true story. If you love the action of hockey and love a little action in the movie (fights on the ice) I recommend that if you haven't seen it yet...do so...you won't regret it!! The whole process in having an Olympic team and watching them succeed from being not so good TO GREAT and beating the Soviets is amazing!!! True stories are always fun to watch on TV cause even if you know the outcome...it's always fun to watch the in between action!!!,10,1,1,22 January 2005
