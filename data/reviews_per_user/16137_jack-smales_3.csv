E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Pure overrated trash
","Apologies to fans of this film(and I realise that thereare loads of them from reading the reviews on here,but personanly I think that this is a stupid,dumb,overrated family film.Live action family films I think are like the little girl with the curl ryme.When they are good they are briiliant(like Oliver!,102 Dalmations and Cats and Dogs)and when they are bad they are either stupid or awful.This is one of them along with Free Willy.That was really dumb!Perhaps it just me,but I just think it is shallow.Still,others may like it.",Null,1,4,10 October 2003
Mulan," A surprisingly decent Walt Disney film
","I and my sister are taught at home and we were doing a topic about China.My Mum said about seeing this film so we rented a copy from the library.I agreed to watching it,but to tell you the truth I was dreading it.I expected it to be like Aladdin,really iratating! BUT,I was so surprised.It was funny,witty and there was a good twist of Chinese culture.I read in a book that the Disney team went to China to do research for the film so that was good. Mulan was not your typical Disney heroine,she was likeable and you felt sorry for her. The songs were very enjoyable and so was the film. Well done Disney:-)!",9,2,2,29 September 2003
2001: A Space Odyssey," Pure slow,boring,dumb fun
","My dad really likes this film and I am BAFFLED!I watched although he said I probably would not like it and he was right.The film is sooooooo snail-paced. My mum said that she feel asleep when she went with him to see it at the cinema,and I don`t blame her. I gave up after the first 10 minutes,so there you have it. If you want a science fiction film you will enjoy,watch Planet of the Apes and Escape from the Planet of the Apes.2\10",Null,2,5,25 September 2003
