Lucky Number Slevin," Kansas City Shuffle - whatever you do don,t ask!
","I had the unnerving experience of watching this and 'The Salton Sea' on the same day - I don't recommend it, not a good combination!!Both are far too off the wall. However that bit of bad programming to one side, this film is an interesting piece of black whimsy. I enjoyed it (despite Sir Ben's somewhat OTT acting)though I had figured out the crux of the film during the initial flashback sequence to the horse race and the subsequent killing of the unlucky gambler, his wife and young son. If you like lots of shootings and dead bodies in your thrillers then this film is for you. The story hinges around a bad case of mistaken identity, or does it? As I say I'd sussed it out in the first ten minutes! As a piece of film-making this is an interesting effort but not a great effort. However Josh Hartnet was a revelation, I had no idea he was as good as that; Lucy Liu is also very good. And she and Hartnet bounce well off one another. The film is worth seeing if only for all the vomitary and migraneous wallpaper: straight out of the sixties. Loved also both the direct and indirect references to that great Cary Grant film 'North by Northwest'. The last ten minutes of the film are spent explaining how it all worked. Again I really didn't require any explanation but it was done so entertainingly I didn't mind being patronised. Bruce Willis did what Bruce Willis does best, i.e. being quietly menacing. Slevin may be no George Kaplan or Nick Fisher for that matter but he is an oddly engaging character. This is not the best film you ever likely to see, but it is fun and a great way to spend a miserable February afternoon. P.S. Don't ask a stranger what a Kansas City Shuffle is, that'd be definitely a bad move.",7,2,13,27 February 2006
Deja Vu," Minority Report hits Back to the Future hits Blade Runner hits Without a Trace hits Bill and Ted head on!
","This is a really good, exciting, action/romance type movie. From the word go it looks fabulous. The photography and the management of the crowds of extras all boarding the ferry, partying on board and then the aftermath of the explosion is amazing. The explosion itself is a visceral,breathtaking experience. The story is peopled with so many nice characters that you can't help but be drawn in. Denzel Washington gives yet another superb and riveting performance (Tell me? How is it he never ages?)and strips off beautifully too. The story involves time travel, and as with any story that makes use of such a device one has to be prepared to suspend disbelief. The idea of going back in time to stop a 'Perp' before he commits a crime clearly has been done before in 'Minority Report', but this story is an exciting new take on that theme. Both 'Back to the Future' and 'Bill and Ted' have examined the difficulties of time travel but in a jokey context, thus there is room for this serious piece within the oeuvre. The investigative reconstruction methods owed something to 'Without a Trace', sign of Mr Bruckheimer's hand in there I think. In my opinion the story holds up pretty well under scrutiny; its internal logic works well. It is an intelligently written piece. Those who have problems with the plotting perhaps are not adept time-travellers like some of us. All in all this is a very enjoyable film that I would confidently recommend to anyone who likes good quality action movies.",8,1,2,18 December 2006
Apocalypse Now," Saigon Sh*t!!
","On first viewing of this film I found the story so awful it was painful to watch. I wanted to forget it; but once seen this film lives on in one's memory. Clearly it is a highly allegorical work as is the novel it is derived from : 'Heart of Darkness' by Joseph Conrad. It says much about the human condition in general not only within the context of war. Strictly speaking the film charts Willard's path through hell and ultimately to redemption. In reality Martin Sheen, who plays Willard, did practically the same thing. Reputedly smoking and drinking just a shade too much until half way through the filming he suffered a heart attack. Coppola's own path through this jungle of a film was equally harassing (watch 'Hearts of Darkness' to get a better perspective on the making of the movie) resulting on the shoot taking far longer than originally planned. It's difficult now not to elide fact with fiction when discussing this film. Even before it was released I can remember newspaper headlines asking 'Apocalypse When?' In the event the film was at last completed with the result that it is probably the most searing war film or any other kind of film you are likely to see. The acting throughout is brilliant from Sheen and Duvall, and fascinatingly quirky from Brando and Hopper. The cinematography is breathtaking and the use of music inspired. I cannot count the number of times I have seen it and it still thrills and enlightens me. A must for any DVD collection. P.S. Don't see the REDUX version.",10,4,5,21 October 2005
Hero," Fabulous
","I see that many others of you have commented on this amazing film. However having just seen it for a second time (on this occasion on DVD) I felt impelled to write. This is probably the most beautiful, elegiac, balletic film of epic proportions that you are ever likely to see up to present date (i.e. 28/3/2006). There is nothing to criticise. The acting by Jet Li, Tony Leung, Donnie Yen and Maggie Cheung as the hero/assassins is faultless and gripping. The direction exquisite and deliberately mannered which fits the style of the story impeccably. The photography is simply unbelievable, as are the sets and the costumes. The sound track, whether the sound effects such as falling rain drops or the music itself (composed by Tan Dun and played by Itzak Perlman)is heart-stopping in its loveliness and appropriateness. The editing is flawless. The choreography spectacular. What else can I say other than the story itself is deeply thought-provoking and heart-rending. I'm so glad I've bought this DVD and can indulge myself with a film that ranks up amongst those other cinema greats.",10,5,9,28 March 2006
Casino Royale," Best Bond ever
","Initially I had been teased into thinking that Clive Owen was up for the vacant role of Bond. He seemed perfect for the part so I was a little disappointed when I discovered it had gone to Daniel Craig. In the event Mr Craig was stunning. His acting ability won me round completely into believing him to be the best Bond ever; and let us face it great acting is not what we have come to expect of a Bond movie. And he more than looks the part, unlike some of the earlier Bonds. The opening free-running sequence amongst the cranes is genuinely terrifying, particularly for anyone with a smidgen of acrophobia. He kills brutally, he loves passionately. He exudes an air of vulnerability which makes the character so much more real. He falls in love; he fights, he runs like the wind, he gets poisoned and is forced to self-administer both emetics and defibrillators. We see him totally stripped of his clothes and dignity and whipped with a heavy duty knotted rope. We watch as he is transformed into a detached arid killing machine during the course of this very long film (2 hours 30 minutes). One hopes however that he retains some of his more human feelings that were on display for us in this Bond outing for the next instalment; and that like this film it is almost gadget free. I watched this on Sunday morning and have to say it was a great way to start the day. It is a must see for anyone who likes action films not just die-hard Bond aficionados.",9,1,3,20 November 2006
