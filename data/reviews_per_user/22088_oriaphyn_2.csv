Mission: Impossible III," 3rd Installment redeems MI:2 and Tom's weird antics
","*** WARNING: MILD SPOILERS *** I have to say, before I saw this movie I was pretty impressed by the trailers. I was not however impressed by the 2nd MI movie which is by far one of the worst movies of all time, or by Tom's weird religious antics/couch jumping. However despite all that, this movie was pretty darn good.The performances were pretty flawless and J.J Abrams is one director who knows damn well how to direct good action sequences. The action begins in flashback of a moment just before Davion (Hoffman) is threatening to execute Ethan's (Cruise) wife right before his eyes. And then the movie begins with intrigue going from a frantic helicopter rescue, to Italy, to the much hyped bridge scene (which lives up to all the hype and more) and doesn't lose pace from there for another hour until the end.All in all, after watching this movie I can really forgive the entire MI franchise and also Tom cruise. He may be a bit weird, but when he does what he does best which is act, he does a mighty good job that is well worth watching.",8,5,10,4 May 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," For anyone who has ever felt love and loss
","For anyone who has ever felt the emotions of love and loss, this movie will strike at the very heart of you.Eternal Sunshine really moved me in that I could relate to all the characters and their motives and at the same time the film felt so real it felt like my own life.Kaufman has been applauded as a screen writing genius ever since Being John Malkovich and this is probably his best movie to date. Coupled with the talents of director Gondry, the quality of this film shines through in every scene.The story is told through a dream-like yet vivid serious of recollections and events that paint a bright and multi-colored picture of the characters. Gondry is able to paint such a vivid picture that the characters feel so organic that their personalities can be felt by the audience.All in all seeing this film is a bittersweet irony and is definitely worth seeing.",9,1,4,15 July 2005
