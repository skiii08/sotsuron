The Ring," Very Americanized in a good way
","I admit the American Ring is very faithful to the Japanese original one as I've seen the original one as a Japanese. Though it was very interesting that I didn't feel scared much comparing to the original one. That might be simply because that I knew the story already, but I would say the expression of horror is very different from Japaense way. As Japanese horror tends to hide the most scary part and let viewers expand their imagination to get scared, American version is more revealing the part you should get scared. The depiction of mother and child is also bit different and seemed very American to me. I thought it must be very hard to translate this Japanese way of fear into American way, but I think this gets really well translated in the end to the understandable Americanized version of the Ring. I could enjoy the movie as a totally new version.",6,0,0,30 June 2005
