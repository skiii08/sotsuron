Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Cinematic Achievement
","Most of the current brouhaha appears to revolve around several key questions, so let me try to summarize:IS THIS A MOVIE PRIMARILY FOR FANS No, although if you've been living in a cave for the last 23 years and never heard of the Star Wars saga, you won't get the same out of this movie as if, say, you've just seen all three previous special edition movies.  That's not to say that this movie can't stand on its own merits; without ever seeing any of the previous three, PM would still be an artistic accomplishment. My suggestion, though, is to rent the previous three and view them before seeing PM.  In this way you can better compare the story elements, art direction, characters, effects, etc.IS THIS A MOVIE PRIMARILY FOR KIDS Absolutely.  Whenever the central character is a nine year old boy, and the movie is rated PG, you can expect it to be primarily directed at that age range.  That's not to say that adults won't find it interesting, just that adults should pay attention to other elements, say mythological elements in the story, differences between worlds, foretelling of possible future story elements, similarity to other famous movies (think pod racing = chariot racing), etc, in much the same way that 'Alice in Wonderland' and 'Gulliver's Travels' are not just children's books.  In other words, the kids will love the pod races and the action, while the adults can appreciate the complexity of the universe that Lucas has created, one which encompasses religion, geography, politics, ecology, mysticism, psychology, mythology, etc.  And the kid in every one will love the action sequences.ARE SOME CHARACTERS INTENDED TO BE SIMPLY STUFFED ANIMALS/COMMERCIAL KNOCK-OFFS Yes.  Look at the Ewoks.  Same thing.  Remember that Lucas _invented_ the concept of marketing the characters in his movies as action figures, and by all accounts has made a sizable fortune in the process.  In PM, the main character intended for commercialization is Jar Jar Binks, a goofy half humanoid with floppy ears and a caribbean accent (not Jamaican BTW; I've been to Jamaica several times and this is nothing like it, but apparently an amalgamation of different English accents).  Jar Jar is intended partly as comic relief, partly to show Lucas' idea that primitive societies can stand up to and defeat more technologically advanced societies.  And my friend who saw PM with me thought he was cute.HAS THIS MOVIE BEEN OVER-HYPED?  SHOULD EXPECTATIONS BE LOWERED The short answer is 'no', but don't expect this to be the greatest movie of all time either.  On visuals alone this movie is astounding, by far one of the best movies to come out in years, far better than any other movie _in its same category_, which is to say sci-fi/fantasy.  In other words, don't expect the crisp dialogue of 'Shakespeare in Love', the acting of 'Streetcar Named Desire', and so on.  But then again, the Star Wars movies have never had that.  Lucas is primarily a visual storyteller, spinning worlds out of nothing but his imagination, and mixing in very traditional ideas common to many cultures, good versus evil, son versus father, light and dark.  Like someone pointed out to me recently, 'Seven Samurai' doesn't have astounding dialogue or acting either, yet nobody complains that Samurai is over-hyped.ARE SOME OF THE ACTORS WOODEN IN THEIR ROLES Yes, in particular Liam Neeson, who looks uncomfortable in long grey hair. Reportedly he didn't know exactly how to act in front of a blue screen. Ewan Magregor does a better job as a young Obi Wan, and Natalie Portman is actually quite good.IS THIS AS GOOD AS THE PREVIOUS STAR WARS MOVIES? No doubt this is the best of the bunch.  An interesting point which I believe Richard Corliss made when reviewing the original Star Wars was that all the spaceships looked slightly banged up, as if they'd seen some use, giving an authentic feel to that movie.  It's interesting to note that in PM the ships look shiny and new.  This may be a result of (a) better computer graphics than miniature models, or (b) a subtle message that in the Republic, prior to the onset of the Empire with all its degeneration, things were shiny and new.  Nice touch.In contrast to the colorfulness of PM, the original movies appear to be in black and white, again, possibly due to their predominant theme of battle of dark vs. light.  In PM, there is only an incipient threat of darkness approaching, and the Republic is enjoying the last days of its heyday.Also, if you notice closely at the dialogue, the original three had very short dialogue scenes, never more than a few lines at a time, and the androids always had the best lines.  This is also true in the Star Wars books, BTW.  In PM, dialogue is more extensive, laying the groundwork for a longer, more paced story.  There are also intriguing hints of possible future story lines (liberation of slaves, romantic liaisons).  I am reminded that this is the first act of a three act play, which nonetheless must have something of its own introduction and final climax.And of course, the effects alone are infinitely superior in PM.  The lightsaber duels now look like real martial arts fights, like two samurai warriors who possess supernatural powers really fighting.In summary, this is a cinematic achievement.  Although it is premature to judge this story on the first act alone, the visuals are indeed mindblowing. Like someone pointed out, when the original Star Wars came out the best picture Oscar went to 'Annie Hall', a worthy movie, yet Star Wars is the one considered one of the 10 best movies of all time. For my part, Joecool says this is a very cool movie.",9,0,0,26 May 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Excellent, witty look at Shakesperean England
","Occasionally there are movies which inspire not only by their acting but also by their ingenious story and witty writing.  Such a movie is 'Shakespeare in Love', now out in limited release (you can check it out at smaller art houses, but arrive early to find a seat as every performance is selling out).The movie, written by Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman and Directed by John Madden (amazing what he can do when he isn't commentating on football games :), has probably the wittiest dialogue and most original premise that I've seen in years:  What would happen if Will were a struggling playwright with writer's block, who needs the inspiration of a muse to finish his first big play, tentatively titled 'Romeo and Ethel, the Pirates Daughter'?  Enter lovely Gwyneth Paltrow as a poetry-struck noblewoman who yearns for the stage; she disguises herself as a boy to act in the new production, only to fall for the young poet himself.  But then, she has been engaged in a marriage of convenience to the well-titled but lightly-monied Lord Wessex, and the game is an-on.  What follows is a fascinating play of words, funny situations made more funny by their similarity to modern times (check out the waiter giving out the 'daily special' at the restaurant - a scream), full-egoed actors fighting for better parts, producers just trying to keep the show going, and intricate Shakespearean changes of scene.  The writers and Director are to be commended for blending the best of the Bard's comedies and making them appealing and understandable to modern audiences. You'll have to watch this flick more than once to catch all the little Elizabethan in-jokes.The performances are good, with a great cast.  Joseph Fiennes (Ralph's little brother) puts in a good performance as the lovestruck poet, and Gwyneth Paltrow plays the muse beautifully (of course she could play anything 'beautifully' ;), then again, after 'Emma', if she played dead it would be an improvement.  But the real treat is in the supporting cast, Geoffrey Rush as the producer who believes it all works out in the nick of time by a miracle, Dame Judi Dench as the stern yet human Elizabeth Regina, Ben Affleck as an Elizabethan Tom Cruise with a cruiseship size ego.My only criticism: although like most good stories the ending is eventually foretellable, it drags a bit.  Of course, considering that the writers were taking on one of the finest writers of all times, someone who understood that after standing for two or three hours the audience wanted a good, strong, quick resolution, the ending is fine, but not up to old Will's standards.  Nevertheless, Joecool recommends this movie, a flick not to be missed.  This is what one gets into the business for.",Null,0,0,5 January 1999
The Thin Red Line," Wings of Private Ryan
","The Thin Red Line represents Terrence Malick's return to movie making after a twenty year hiatus.  For his subject he chose James Jones autobiographical novel telling the story of a platoon of army grunts during WWII, sent into Guadalcanal just after the Marine invasion, to clean up the remnants of Japanese resistance from that island.  Little did they know that this clean up operation would last more than six months and take the lives of many.IMHO, the best part of this movie are the looks.  Visually, this movie is stunning.  The cinematography really shows us a paradise on earth, one which we know and fear will soon be despoiled by war.  The story line can best be described as a long, sometimes rambling philosophical discussion on war, men, and their internal conflicts as they are asked to kill or be killed, sometimes in the most seemingly senseless way.  Most of the movie contains voice over narrations of the characters thoughts.  In this the movie resembles closely Wim Wenders classic art-house flick 'Wings of Desire', where the angels in the movie can hear the humans' thoughts (this film was very poorly remade as 'City of Love' last year; do yourself a favor and rent the original).  TRL uses the same narrative technique, except the characters (and there are quite a number of them) are even less clearly defined, thereby giving us the sense that these soldiers are nameless and faceless, just more cannon fodder attempting to stay sane in an incredibly insane situation.  Before the second reel, several of them have already lost their sanity, and it is questionable whether the more-or-less lead character himself is sane.Many people have commented that this is not a war movie, which is partially true.  Comparisons to the other recent war flick, 'Private Ryan', are also inevitable.  To be fair, the battle scenes in this movie, though not very extensive, are among the best ever filmed, the equal or perhaps superior to the famous 'Private Ryan' scenes.  But the narrative is different.  This movie is more of an artsy movie, albeit an artsy war movie.Great performances by Nick Nolte as the aging coronel who wants as much glory as he can muster from his one and only big war.  Although the pic is chock full of some of the best male actors in the businees (Sean Penn, John Cusack, Ben Chaplin, Jon Savage), their roles are not really juicy enough to warrant a lot of attention.  For exmaple George Clooney appears in the movie for one scene, and John Travolta for a scene and half; it's hard to give either a good or a very bad performance in 20 seconds. From what I understand, Malick actually shot something like 100 hours worth of footage, which he had to pare down to only 3.  I'm curious whether some of the footage left on the cutting room floor would've fleshed out the characters or focused the film better.  As it is, it's difficult to ask anyone to sit through three hours of ruminations.",Null,0,0,20 February 1999
