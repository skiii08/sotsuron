Source Code," Lots of promise -- weak weak delivery
","Despite the generally rave reviews Source Code has gotten, I found it to be far less than I was expecting and wanting. To get to the point, though I am a lifelong lover of science fiction, I tend to be put off by science fiction films where the 'science' comes across as something conceived and explained by a poorly educated non-scientist grabbing buzz words out of thin air. Source Code falls apart in the 'science coherence' realm for me, and thus I find the film fundamentally flawed. A side note to that, I had had the impression that Source Code was a 'time travel' story, but no, they put that hoped for idea to rest quickly by the lead 'scientist' mumbling something about this *not* being time-travel but rather he gives a mumbo-jumbo-buzz-words-what- did-he-say lame and confusing explanation.Then the film suffers from a terrible supporting cast. The cardboard cutout characters that communicate with the main character have as much depth and value as... cardboard. The lead scientist is a stereotype guy rummaging around in his lab coat being indifferent to his 'subject', while the military liaison that is the prime communicator with the main character is dealt a very poor script and no depth. By the time she does her 'save-the-hero' act near the end, who cares.... there's been no establishment of character other than a face on a video monitor with no backstory (except a crumb near the end).Don't get me started on the CGI... the train explosions and other effects --- which were minimal. A trained eye will quickly identify the CGI effects as being... budget oriented. Nuff said.Honestly, I'd save my $15 that it'll cost at the theater and wait for DVD or Netflix. Despite a good performance by Jake G., Source Code is a lame film, poorly written and directed without inspiration.",4,51,97,11 April 2011
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Ugh... no heart. A snoozer. Bad casting continues..
","Was bored to the point of agitation. Rey's character was fine. Luke Skywalker-- Mark Hammil, I'm sorry, could't believe the cardboard performance. And don't get me started on the Kylo Ren actor -- as bad as that awful thing that played a young Darth Vader. For me a real snoozer. In fact, I walked out after 1:15 mark. Ugh. Sad.",3,1,2,21 December 2017
The Witch," One of the best films I've ever seen. Will watch again.
","I'm a history buff and a lover of a story well told. This story, The Witch, knocked me out with it's incredible depth of historical and cultural accuracy, the earnest and believable characters, and the extraordinary belief system that they held on to as a psychic buffer in the face of such risk and courage.The director wisely chose relatively unknown actors to give the story an almost documentary subtext. But the actors were all sublimely believable and wonderful to observe.I worry that the way the movie is promoted as horror, witchcraft and possession will keep some away from experiencing this masterful creation. I'd simply characterize the film differently: A psychological thriller based on how the people of the time would interpret what's happening around them in the world. A true New England folktale, as it's tag line properly declares.The Witch is the best depiction of the early Puritan culture and challenges I've ever seen. I will watch again soon to absorb more of the rich details the director, designers, production crew and actors created.Bravo.",9,1,3,22 October 2016
