Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The greatest SFX movie so far!
","George Lucas has created the best (number+quality) special effects (SFX) movie ever made(so far).  Any one who tries to judge this movie on any other basis is totally missing the point behind the STAR WARS epic. (The only flaw was that water did not convincingly drip from wet characters digital or otherwise, except the spittle from Boss Nass).Sure the character interplay wasn't as much fun as Episode IV, but this was more than compensated for by the tons of SFX.There are plenty of universal messages given, but go see this movie to have fun!Sit back and enjoy!",10,0,3,25 November 1999
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," A real blast from the past
","After 'concerned' parents groups(censors) succeeded in completely neutering television cartoons for adults(and for any child over the age of five), because 'they were on when children could be watching', it was only natural that movies would eventually take up the slack (with highly varying degrees of success).'Roger Rabbit' was probably the most successful attempt of bringing back the sophisticated wit and cartoon 'violence' that earlier cartoons were famous for.I only hope that television can break the grasp of government imposed censorship and cartoons 'like the good old days' could return.",7,2,3,1 May 2001
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Episode IV, redux
","George Lucas did not have enough money to do Episode IV the way he wanted to and Episode V, despite a superior script suffered, a 10 percent drop in the box office.  So he used Episode VI as an excuse to do the special effects the way he wanted to do it.  Despite a promising beginning, Episode VI pretty much ended like Episode IV--the enhanced special effects added little to the ending.  Also it was disappointing because we saw the 'departure' of another beloved Jedi--although with hind(fore)sight we see this was probably necessary to fulfill a prophecy from Episode I.The only thing that made this movie worthwhile was seeing princess Leia in the 'slave girl costume'.",7,0,2,26 December 2000
Alien," As good as it was, it could have been better
","This film is obviously the 'Star Wars' of outer space horror films and I was almost as blown away at the originality of this movie as I was with the special effects in 'Star Wars'.Unfortunately, on a 'Creature Feature' late night program I got to see what was left out--and I was even more blown away and disappointed with the theatrical release.Although later pictures in the Alien series gave of some of this, what the hell was Ridley Scott thinking?  He had left most of the good stuff out.  I subtracted 2 points from a 10 for stupidity!",8,0,1,29 December 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Incompetence or Genius?
","I was almost as disappointed with Episode II, as I was with Episode VI. I only liked it slightly better, because the special effects were a lot cleaner--what would you expect with close to 20 years more computing power and 100 million, or so, more in budget (not inflation adjusted).I kept asking myself what was wrong, and this is my analysis:1)  This is Star WARS, we did not get the impression there was a real war going on, until late into the movie. In all the other good episodes, there was a space fleet, actively engaged in battle early into the film--and usually after our heroes.2)  The promised romance had virtually no plot significance (for this episode) and was not particularly passionate or well done. I know Star Wars is for kids, but George a lot of your fans are know well passed their twentys and thirtys!  Throw us a bone why don't you?3)  R2-D2 and C3PO had virtually no relation to the plot and were just thrown in for comic relief (too much criticism of Jar-Jar?).4)  Nobody bad wore a mask throughout, without revealing a recognizable'human face'.  This wildly reduced the 'menace' facing our protagonists. Exactly who was the antagonist here anyway--Boba Fett?5)  Where were the machines that inconveniently malfunctioned at inappropriate times?  This reduced the fun and perceived danger.6)  Blatant rip offs of elements from other popular science fiction franchises--(I know he does this a lot, but at least he used a little imagination previously).  Padme's battle outfit was almost an exact copy of the Defense Directorate uniforms from 'Buck Rogers in the 25th Century'.7)  'Star Wars' has almost always been the exposition of stealth and cunning versus blatant force and power, but this is increasingly downplayed.  I guess this may be to show why the Jedi fell from grace.One outstanding, and disappointing, aspect was watching Yoda finallyyield his light sabre--What a hoot.I hope George can recover from this one in Episode III.  Apparently, it will be his last shot (yeah--right!)",6,0,2,21 May 2002
The Thing," Some of the most original Special Effects in a horror film
","When I saw a still of a face splitting in two in the 'pink section' of the San Francisco Examiner/Chronicle (Ex/Chron), I knew there was something highly original about this film I had to see--and it did not disappoint!. Every time the creature appeared, the result was a shock, unexpected and a delight.  Even testing blood with a hot wire turned into an other-worldly surprise.  (Honorable mention to the head with spider legs!).Why people (and critics!) chose the mental pablum, E.T., over this horror masterpiece must be one of the great mysteries of the universe!",9,0,1,18 April 2001
American Psycho," Should have been made 15 years ago
","It is too bad that this movie was made now with the current MPAA guidelines, rather back when Jason/Freddie/et. al. were king--this would have been a classic.  But alas, rumor has it that certain vital scenes were cut to achieve an 'R' rating and it shows.    The book made it clear that Batemen was a necrophiliac, but the movie makes it seem that he feels sexually inadequate because his business card is not up to snuff!  There may be some rebellious elements to the emptiness of his well to do world, and the Reagan go-go 80's.  If you prefer the latter explanation, this was not a bad film; if you prefer the former, this movie is almost a total waste of time.",6,1,2,17 April 2000
American Beauty," Competent, but others are better
","This film was generally well made (a typical 'formula' movie), but I personally didn't get it.  I cant tell you why without spoiling the ending, but I can say that I didn't understand Annette Benning's motivation to do what she did to Kevin.  If you want to see a much better(and funnier!) treatment of pretty much the same subject, I would recommend 'Serial(of Marin)'.  This movie covers marital infidelity in a much broader social setting and never fails to entertain me, despite its 80's bent(although the teenage love interest is not as cute).    This film getting the oscar was kind of like 'Ordinary People' getting an oscar--I dont think it will hold up 5 years hence.  I  will say now, and many others will say later:  'Why didn't 'Eyes Wide Shut' get the best picture instead'.",7,0,0,25 June 2000
Spider-Man," A Real Swinger
","Raimi, more than any other director, has almost perfectly captured the style and grace of Spider Man, especially when he swings around on his web going from building to building.  He also does a great job of capturing his grace of motion while doing gymnastics and fighting--but that is about it!  He does almost nothing to capture the youth angst that the original SpiderMan conveyed in the comic books.  This may mostly be because the three main characters just seem to be phoning in the lines.  After seeing Jonah Jameson, I prayed for the time when he would be back on screen (this character was captured perfectly!).  Hopefully in future installments, the movie will take place more at the Bugle and we can see more of him.  I hope Aunt May doesn't die soon, as she also did a fairly competent job of capturing the sweetness of the comic book character.Except for the web slinging and Kirsten Dunst in her occasional short skirts, there is not much else here.  Can't they find someplace else in New York to have a showdown, except for the Brooklyn Bridge?P.S.  Fire the cinematographer!  'Depth of Focus' does not seem to be in his vocabulary!",7,0,0,5 May 2002
Aliens," Superceded by 'Starship Troopers', but great for its time
","This movie is the perfect allegory, and I mean gory, for the United States and the Vietnam war.  We went into this conflict gung-ho and thinking we could bead anyone and got our asses kicked.Of course, 'StarShip Troopers' gives us a cast of thousands of arachnids and takes us through the basic training that gives military their invincible attitude and gave us background of the society that created them, this is never explored, except for allusions to 'the company'.For a bunch of guys dressed up in rubber suits, he aliens do a fairly competent job of being menacing.  The real strength of this film is the characterizations and how different people react under stress.Also, the Alien 'embryo implantors' are at their creepiest.",10,1,2,30 December 2000
1941," Speilberg's 2nd best work!
","I know I am in a (very small) minority--I love Steve's comedies a hell of a lot better than his other 'serious' works--except 'Schindler's List'.  In his comedies the characters are painted with broad strokes, he rarely resorts to bad puns or obvious jokes.  And stuff is always getting blown up! His plots usually make little sense, except on the comedy level.  His comedies never fail to delight me.",5,1,2,28 December 2000
Ghostbusters," Does not hold up well over time (a second viewing)
","When this movie came out, 'Saturday Night Live' was arguably at its peak, Star Wars mania was at its crest, and special effects wizards almost took their place with directors as the most important talent in making a movie. 
This film had it all--two SNL stars wise cracking their way through a science fiction/ horror film with some original special effects.  However, like eating rock candy, the second piece does not satisfy after you realize there is no substance to what is there--only a sugar rush.Amazingly, when 'panned and scanned' for Television/video the TV actors do not even hold their own.This movie might hold up better when HDTV comes along (yeah, right)!",7,1,2,2 April 2001
Transformers," Earth Survives, Ho Hum
","It wasn't ever really threatened. In fact, Los Angeles (it was supposedly called something else in the movie) was barely threatened.When you go to see a 'keija' film, especially after seeing the destruction caused by atom bombs, earthquakes, tsunamis, 'Godzilla' movies, etc., you expect a 'threat' to damage some major real estate. However, the Transformers barely did some low-grade demolition work.Most of the film (I assume to save money on not so special effects) is spent on a not so enticing 'back story' where the characters do one of the worst 'misunderstood teens' movies since 'The Blob'. There is the usual 'The military, secret government knew about it all the time' conspiracy and few 'explicit' references to teen sex that are typical of modern teen comedies, but, the characters (especially the hero) is completely unengaging and he has no sexual chemistry with the pre-requisite girl friend. All I kept saying was 'When do the Xformers start slugging it out over Earth, Democracy, the USA, Los Angeles, their home planet, or whatever the hell was at stake'.Unless you really are from another planet and haven't heard or, nor seen a 'Transformer' movie, cartoon, or toy you would be better off skipping this movie.",5,2,7,21 July 2007
Mulholland Drive," Too weird for the masses, not weird enough for Lynch Fans
","I love Lynch--he always surprises me, but usually he tries to top himself each time (it is as though he wants us to share his descent into schizophrenia).  But this time he seems to have back slid--this movie almost made sense!  Except for one loose thread (where did Rita get all all that money?), I practically had the whole thing figured out 5 minutes after the movie ended (I am still trying to figure out 'Twin Peaks', the movie!).  But as usual, there were the usual Lynch virgins in the audience that did not have a clue!Can Lynch stay ahead of his fans, or will he just reverse course and force us to follow.  I guess only time will tell.My biggest beef with him is:  Why doesn't he show the babes fully nude and in focus (instead of just topless?, instead of the uglies--is it too expensive?",9,1,1,22 October 2001
Dumb and Dumber," Dumb, Dumber, and Dumbest
","Am I too old? I just don't get Jim Carrey.  I like bad films, I go out of my way to see bad films.  But usually when these films are bad they are usually somehow intelligent on some level.  Except for Lauren Holly, I cant see anything worth while.  Benny Hill does scatological humor, urine humor and it is funny.  What happened here?  You probably want to see this film along with a 4 or 5 year old to appreciate this.",4,6,15,2 January 2001
2001: A Space Odyssey," Probably the best (but not perfect) predictor of this time
","Here it is January 01, 2001 and though we have another year, its time to see what the scorecard of 2001 space odyssey is.It predicted:  1) The space shuttle; 2) credit card driven phones; 3) the space station; 4) miniature (digital?) cameras; 5) dark monotone suits for menMot happened (yet?) 1) permanent moon bases (in fact no man has been to the moon since 1973; 2) Jupiter mission--we have not even sent a manned mission to mars (in the works?) 3) woman's fashions (pants suits are passe)--but a good predictor for the 1980's; 3) cryogenic suspension for humans.Middle of the road: 1) Talking, but not 'sentient' computers;When you consider the 'Star Trek' predicted we would have starships by the 1990's, it seems that Kubrick really did his home work.See this film while stoned and you won't care about this.  This film was obviously the biggest mind blower of all the commercially release films by a major studio.",10,0,2,1 January 2001
Total Recall," Consider that the divorce
","Arnold obviously peaked with this performance.  Its the last time he looked relatively muscular and a semblance of his former muscle building days. After this, he tried starving himself into a 'leading man' physique that may have lead to his requiring heart surgery.In this movie he is at his articulate best (for him) and he is actually given a chance to act--although Sharon and Rachel (and pretty much the rest of the cast ) outshine him, this is pure Arnold.And Peter, the master of high camp violence (probably the Sam Peckinpah of our generation) does his usual excellent job of over the top, but highly original violence.After this one, Arnold was just a pale parody of his former self.",9,0,1,2 January 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," Finally, an 'art film' for (heterosexual) men
","Mr. Kubrick seems to be the only person alive that had the audacity to make an 'art film' for men.  This film was shot in his inimitable *visual* style with lots of gorgeous naked females that would have made Helmut Newton proud.Why is it always the female that has to have internal sexual conflicts over the slightest wounds to their egos?  Why is it the male that always has to act out his sexual frustrations while the female discusses it interminably with her friends?For those of you with an I.Q. under 140, I will tell you what this film is about:  'Tom Cruise got 'mental' sexual revenge on Nicole Kidman by committing adultery in his mind!--he never actually went through with it!'. Simple enough?Now sit back and enjoy the *visual* experience that can only come from a Kubrick film.This film was the final act one the true geniuses of the cinema, and if you still dont get it, I suggest you take something else with you when you go to the movies--your imagination.This film was by and away the best film of the year or of the last decade.",9,0,1,28 June 2000
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Almost as good as 'Dracula's Dog'!
","Just Kidding!  I just wanted to point out that the Dracula phenomenon has been so over the map that Coppola's genius in this movie was to play it (almost) straight.  Although Dracula was played sometimes in an almost 'Kabuki' fashion, there is extreme attention to detail and an attempt to set the mood of the time. (I had the chance to visit the set while it was being shot and it is amazing how the simple sets were made to look so opulent on screen).  The characterizations were just kooky enough and straight enough to make you want to watch the screen play forever.  Unfortunately it had to end and the ending was less than satisfying.If you want to see how a master film maker handles a too oft campy legend, this is the film for you.",8,0,1,28 December 2000
Bring It On," By the numbers cheerleading Flick
","Kirsten Dunst has done about 35 films in her relatively short life.  Its hard to believe after all that experience she can not act her way out of a paper bag.  Her lack luster performance keeps a perfunctory script pretty much in the land of mediocrity.  The black cheerleaders try their best to add some needed talent to the fray, but they are not on the screen long enough to make a difference.An attempt to put a 'Clueless' spin on the romance side was written by someone who was equally clueless.In the film she becomes cheerleader captain of some of the most overweight 'champion' high school cheerleaders you will probably ever see (although some light is made of this fact in the movie).  They also seem to have won their championships without a coach!.The cheerleading routines where pretty much standard and their execution would have probably landed them a 5th or 6th place at the nationals.If you want to see better, more original routines, see 'Gimme an 'F''.  If you want to see better insight into what it takes to lead a cheerleading squad, see 'The Cheerleaders(1972)'.Altogether, not a bad popcorn movie, if you are into cheerleading.",5,0,0,28 August 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," I loved this movie--but
","Dont get me wrong, when this movie came out, it was like a splash of ice cold water after a night of drunken orgy.  I was so blown away, that I saw it over fifty times. I have one major complaint about the way this film changed the theatrical exhibition business.I, like hundreds of others in the theatre, was sitting there with my eyes in a glaze and my mouth wide open in amazement over what I had just seen, when an usher came out and said we had to 'clear the theater'!.Excuse Me? I had been going to movies for over 20 years and the price of admission had always meant that you could stay as long as you wished until the theater closed.  Why was this?  I heard that the theaters had gotten 'Star Wars' for next to nothing, because of the lack of known names or star power--This was just a money grab! (I didn't know at the time that there was a basis for a law suit, although 'class action' suits were almost unheard of then)When I went to see other films, I found that not only did they not have a second bill (B-Movie), but you could only stay for one seating--even if you were late!Although Star Wars episodes have contributed much to my entertainment pleasure, it also took away a great part of the movie going experience.I guess its a good wind that does not blow some one some ill.",9,0,2,27 December 2000
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Darth Vader's greatest role
","This is Darth Vader's movie.  We find out why he is the number 2 man(?) in the galaxy.  He's ruthless, insightful, powerful, ambitious, and devious. Most importantly, we find out why he is so evil--he wants to take over the galaxy!  His ambitions are no different than the rebel's, except he wants to be emperor.  He doesn't care about Han, Laeia, Chewbacca, or the rebels--they are just pawns in his ambitious game to depose the emperor.  Of course in episode VI, we find out where his true sympathies lie.Darth is marvelously delicious in this film.",9,0,0,26 December 2000
