Saturday Night Fever," Character-driven disco movie
","Saturday Night Fever is more than disco, and a period piece from the late seventies. It also have a great character development, a classic/legendary performance from John Travolta and a classic soundtrack. So if you`re a fan of the late seventies and/or John Travolta, you will love this film.  My rating: 9/10",10,0,1,7 December 2002
The Big Lebowski," Hilarious movie!
","The Big Lebowski is Coens best along with Fargo. Only the Coen brothers could create a masterpiece like this one. The story, actors and the dialogue provide for a fun two hours. The story itself is not important, but it`s oddball cast of characters that makes the movie so funny and charming. Jeff Bridges gives one of his best performances of his career as The Dude, his extremely lazy lifestyle makes you laugh. John Goodman is good as The Dude`s best friend Walter, who is a Vietnam veteran, Steve Buscemi as the quiet but loveable Donny, John Torturro as the eccentric bowler Jesus, Peter Stormare as the former porn star and nihilist and Julianne Moore as Maude. Philip Seymour Hoffman and the rest of the cast also do a great job.  The Big Lebowski is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Especially the dream-sequences are cool and funny.
