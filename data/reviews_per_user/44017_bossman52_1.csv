Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Not really that funny, just shocking
","It is disappointing to me that Americans like this movie that much. It really isn't that funny and usually offensive movies are at least humorous.Personally I really don't think this movie belonged rated R, it shows a penis and lots of other things that anyone under 18 shouldn't see and others may not want to see.I loved Jackass, and I like South Park, but this movie is crap. Some of the little stuff is kinda funny, but most of it is just this guy making an ass of himself.What bothers me is not that he says things that are offensive, but that he is using it for his gain and that he was basically able to get away with it. Especially what he did to Pamela Anderson.",2,9,19,20 November 2006
