Angels & Demons," Excellent movie
","i have read the book 3 times... i have been waiting the movie... and after i watch the movie... OH MY GOD... it was so cool... we all know that usually, if a movie is made based on a novel.. many people who have read the novel will be disappointed after watching the movie... it happens, because the readers imagination is higher than the director of the movie.. but what i see here... in AnD movie.. the argument is false.. the movie was made with very high imagination.. yes indeed there are some parts of the novel that is cut.. but it doesn't matter, because the movie is as brilliant as the novel. If the movie really follows the novel, it will take too long time and will not be effective way to tell the story. And if i haven't read the novel, i still could understand the movie.. thats a plus. Maximillian Kohler is missing, but thats okay.. and the story of robert and vittoria.. was showed implicitly.. and thats good, so this movie, which is a science vs religion movie is not contaminated by love story...... which makes this movie just like a cheap movie... GOOD JOB FOR ALL AnD ACTORS,ACTRESSES,DIRECTOR,everyone who is involved in this film making..",10,4,12,19 May 2009
