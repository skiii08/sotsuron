Despicable Me 2," Could they step it up above the first? Yes, yes they could. And they did.
","There was so much anticipation for this movie! And I can gladly say all that waiting was not in the slightest for naught. The producers obviously realized they had struck a very sweet spot with the minions and they capitalized on that. There was plenty more minion madness and they played a much bigger role in the film than the first. But, it never got to be annoying. All the voice actors, once again, perform terrifically. My only quibble would be that the story turned into a lover rescue mission at the end. There has not been an animated comedy in recent times that does not contain some serious scenes for a considerable portion of the run time. I was hoping Despicable Me 2 would be the first to not do so, but it was not, sadly. However, it's not so bad if that's the worst aspect. It lived up to and exceeded many of my expectations. There are many laughs to be had for people of every age (and some for only the grown ups). It was definitely worth my time and I will be watching it again in the future.

Scarface," Pacino is really deserving of having those millions of posters in people's homes
","It is unavoidable to bring up Michael Corleone when Scarface is the subject. Heck, I did it before I even watched the movie. The reason, obviously, because Montana and Corleone are both big shots of the underground. But while Montana chose his life, Corleone did not. Anyway, enough about the comparison because it is not as relevant as it seems. I will say it over and over again that Scarface is probably Al Pacino's best performance because he flawlessly portrayed a character who was like a polar opposite. From the accent to the mannerisms to the way of life, I think it would be very difficult to find another man unlike Pacino. But man, that accent was terrific. Cubans might disagree because they would have a keener ear, but it seemed pretty close to me. The long continuous scenes typical of this era are executed brilliantly. I always mention how I miss those these days. It kept focus on the scene better than otherwise short sequences with multiple angle switches. And the action scenes are quite fun to watch. Of course, this being the 1980s there are a few scenes that contain the dreaded overacting. And there are so many slangs, it is necessary to keep Urban Dictionary open. This adds to the genuineness, so it is a plus. I was niggled by the preposterous amounts of bullets used. I get that it is a dramatic movie, but when everything else is so terrific, why go to great lengths to make your bad guys look like utter klutzes? And the scene in the Babylon with the assassination attempt, there was no need for the build up to the shoot-out; it was just annoying. A great performance by the whole cast and a great production from the whole crew that is indeed worthy of all the praise and frenzy created by it.

Friday Night Lights," A beautiful and inspiring must-watch football movie BASED on the book
","As an ex-player and deep fan of the book, I can truly say that Friday Night Lights captured the emotions of the players and the fans from the 'small' town of Odessa. It evokes sentiment during every second and, just like in the book, makes the viewer an instant die-hard fan, a member of Odessa's community of Permian supporters. The actors chosen for their respective roles played their parts brilliantly. Hats off especially to Billy Bob Thornton, Lucas Black, Derek Luke, and Garrett Hedlund for their performances. Everyone was totally bonded with their character and did not let go. While the makers did a terrific job in selecting the cast and writing each scene, there were some major issues that interfered with me delving completely into Permian High School, fall 1988. I do not want to sound like a movie sin counter, but I could not look over a lot of the following things.To start off, there was no reason whatsoever for the changes made to the players. Absolutely none. It transformed the story way too much. Brian Chavez was put on defense and had his number changed to 4, an insult to his legacy, in my mind; Ivory Christian was shown to be weak at the beginning and was moved to defensive end as number 90; Boobie Miles had his number changed to 45. They also altered some scores and games that took place. And the list goes on and on. There is no purpose in me dragging on about all the revisions because they can quite simply be Googled. Moving on, the in-your-face anachronism of 21st century cars was quite careless. People were dressed like it was early November for the September 29th game. The zipping about and shaking of the camera, while confusing but suitable for game scenes, was inappropriate for scenes in which a steady shot would easily permit the viewer to grasp what was going on. And last for the list of criticisms, the Rebels game deserved more on-screen time and should have shown the defense playing as well. It made it seem like the Panthers were being absolutely demolished when in fact it was a close game thanks to the defense. I know a large portion of this was dedicated to complaints. But, the flaws stuck out like a sore thumb against the perfection that was the rest of the film. The fact that they only made me dock 2 points says a lot about the quality of the movie. It will pull you in and make you understand and feel what it really is like to be a part of a high school football team in a merciless town. Watched and written 04/13/2014.",8,0,0,13 April 2014
Gravity," Hollywood made a realistic and plausible space movie!
","Believe the hype and the accolades. Just do it. They are all so well deserved for this movie. Those 1- and 2-star reviews? Ignore them. The reviewers probably had no idea what they were watching. At first, I was a bit concerned about the relatively short runtime of only 90 minutes. However, while watching the movie, I realized the number was irrelevant. This is mainly because of how each scene in the movie lasts multiple minutes and only one camera angle is used for the duration of the scene. While in almost every other film, a camera switch between characters goes unnoticed, it is pretty obvious when it takes place here (NOTE: not a criticism; simply an observation). While not perfectly adherent to the laws of physics, Gravity takes the idea of realism in movies to a level being demanded for decades. The most important point here is the sound mixing. It was utterly brilliant. There was a great mix between no sound and dampened sound while out in space, just as reality demands it to be. But, as soon as Stone is back in an environment with air (like the ships and Earth), the sound is all back. It is done properly and I love that. I say that it was not perfect because of the scene where Stone has to untether from Kowalski: his momentum would not have kept tension in the tether perpetually and Stone would have been easily been able to pull him back after the initial full stretch. Truly enjoyable and quite heart-pounding, especially with the first person camera angles. Hollywood needs to take note for every future space movie.

Star Trek Into Darkness," Here's to the next one exploring strange new worlds!
","(+) Terrific humor and chemistry between actors. // Dialog and situations are fluid and artful, never awkward or strained. // Beautiful and realistic special effects which showed evolution, not revolution, of human technology. // Preserved loyalty to crew and ship seen in TOS (among other things). (-) Not much of exploring. More of human infighting with Klingons being used to further that cause. Based on Kirk's closing speech, the 5- year mission might remedy that.

Pacific Rim," Enjoyable and cool, but not very artsy or plot centered (even though that's not the point).
","Once again, I was proved wrong in judging a movie by its trailer. At first, it looked to me to be a sub-par sci-fi idea. I thought it to be, frankly, stupid. And my enthusiasm to see it in the theater did not change much when I was surprised with a stub granting access to a 3D viewing. But, once the action began, I began to see my mistake. Pacific Rim is a wildly exciting film. Although, it is more visually than plot centered. But the visuals are so immersive and seemingly possible, one forgets until the end how much of an engineering impossibility all the Jaegers really are. But, as pointed out in the trailer, it is very cool. The visuals more than make up for the flaws, of which some are quite glaring. For one, why didn't the Gypsy Danger pilots always use that invincible sword? Which also makes one wonder why all the Jaegers don't have the sword. Which in turn brings to mind why the Jaeger program was necessary in the first place. All the allied countries could have built hundreds of plasma cannons and shot the Kaijus. None of the human training would have been necessary. Also, that nuclear reaction nearing the end of the movie should have killed Becket and Mori. Making a good ending seems to be really tough these days and Pacific Rim sadly did not manage to make a satisfactory one. Lastly, as was seen first in the promo posters, the Jaegers heavily resemble Spartans from Halo. A bit of a rip off, really. But no matter, this is a very cool movie and well worth the time in my mind. Watched 07/17/2013, written 08/04/2013.This is my first of hopefully many reviews on IMDb. I have, however written many more on Flixster, but have moved on to IMDb.",7,1,5,4 August 2013
Rush," A touching movie about two motorsport rockstars
","I do not very often find a film to be worth a 10/10; there's always something that would keep a fantastic candidate at a 9. But with Rush, it was difficult to find that something. It was just terrifically made. And I'm not being a biased gearhead either. Granted, I did not know too much about these two drivers until the movie came out. And maybe there were other highlights from the 1976 seasons that were not included, but that was not the point of the movie. First and foremost, a big shout out to the make-up crew and whoever else deals with the appearance of the actors because what they have done is marvelous. I looked into the way the real Hunt, Lauda, and others looked and there was not much of a difference. I have not seen a documentary type film be so accurate in that respect maybe ever. And the actors. Man, they really knew their characters well. Job very well done. What Ron Howard has done here is expose what really goes on in a driver's mind on and off the track and how he interacts with his competitors. For the duration of the film, the viewer is immersed in the world of Formula 1 and all the drama associated with it. It is impossible to not have your heart beat at an elevated rate and impossible to not develop a connection with the people and the time because everything in the film was very 1970s (at least, what I know of the 1970s), including the clothing and all the technology. All in all, Rush is probably the best motorsport movie I have ever watched and definitely one of the best overall. I was truly touched by the story of James Hunt and Niki Lauda and learned a lot in the process about the history of Formula 1. It is extremely genuine and not one to be missed at all!

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A beautiful adaptation of brilliant book.
","I finished the book a few months back and had a blast while reading it. So I decided to watch the Extended Edition to relive as much of the book on the screen as I could. To begin, there are some noticeable differences between the book and the film. However, this is not a complaint; quite the opposite. These scenes served to deliver the story in a way that would not be possible or as entertaining as written by Tolkien. Now, this is not a complaint about the book. Each medium delivered the story in the method best suited to itself. Aside from different delivery forms, there were scenes such as at the end when Aragorn lets Frodo go. In the book, Frodo departs without being sent off by him. The narration at the beginning solidly laid out the background and location of the story. This was a useful addition to help set things up for viewers that have never read the books and a time- saver of narration during the movie for people that have read the books. And all the scenery! These guys could not have chosen better filming locations. Even though the movie had a run time of almost 3.5 hours (lots of credits), there was an omission that bothered me. In the book, Tom Bombadil comes to the Hobbits' aid. He was a major character by Tolkien and I think the quality of the movie's plot suffered without his presence. Another, bigger, source of vexation were the inconsistencies with the CGI. This really bothered me because of the film's budget and the range of CGI quality. On one hand, things like the Balrog were executed with perfection. On the other, there were scenes where it was blatantly obvious the assistance of computers was used and times that the hobbits and Gimli changed size in relation with the men and Elves. I get that the computers from 2000 were not nearly as powerful as today, but when a Balrog can be drawn up so well, a scene of Gandalf flying on an eagle should not give away the truth of Ian McKellen dressed up and sitting in front of a green screen.All this being said, I would willingly watch the movie again; and the second and third are even better.

Silver Linings Playbook," In the end, all you need is a friend to put a smile on your face.
","Up front, I am a sucker for movies that show the power of love and friendship. Silver Linings Playbook is a rom-com that thoroughly embodies those two things. No, that does not bias me. The movie exemplifies what it is like to live with a mental illness. It shows how it does not affect the sufferer, but also the ones around him/her. It has brought greater awareness to people everywhere that mental illness is not a minute detail, but a headline that is constantly on the front page of a person's life. But, like Pat showed, it can be cured by a lifestyle change and a bit of luck of having the right person enter your life at the perfect time. Silver Linings Playbook does not have the sappiness , cheesiness, or predictability that the romantic comedy genre has come to be associated with. Obviously, Pat and Tiffany finally getting together and Pat, Sr. winning so much money is sentimental, but the idea is to have a happy ending. Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro, and the rest of the cast put on an amazing and very lovable performance and demonstrate they all had the chemistry required to act as a family and troupe of friends. The film does a good job of explaining moments that arouse some questions. For example, how is possible for Tiffany to know the exact location of Pat's run? Pat's mom was in on it. Boom. A simple explanation to keep the audience from questioning the overall quality of the movie. There were some imperfections. Undeniably, errors like Pat's chain moving from on his chest to slung over his shoulder are present, but those are not the type of mistakes I am speaking of. Every movie has a few. The major point I am discussing about is the screenplay matching up with the dates. There is a scene showing the characters celebrating Christmas immediately followed by the big day of December 28th. I was not sure at first whether or not they were showing an extended Yuletide celebration or they simply skipped to the Sunday. Anyway, the number of words dedicated to this flaw is way out of proportion. In the end, I had some laughs and heart-warming situations. I cannot give it a 9 and remain guilt- free. I am glad I have been a spectator to another terrific piece of work. I hope this trend of perfect-score films continues! Watched and written 04/11/2014.",10,2,4,11 April 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Utter brilliance marred by not sticking to the formula of the first
","Everything aside from the plot was marvelous. The novel's split of the eastern and western events were skillfully interlaced with one another in the film to create scenes that progressed together chronologically. Many of the light moments in the novels were brought to full light and made quite funny in the film. Gimli got the majority of these entertaining lines. The huge helpings of makeup and CGI were a monumental undertaking and they were executed so perfectly that they had me saying 'WOW!' even 12 years after the original release in front of a TV. In this sector, the film's makers stepped up from the first. I cannot wait to see what is in store for the third. It pains me to have to give this wonderful masterpiece a 9. Alas, it did not stick to the books as it should have. By this I do not mean every single detail; I mean that there were major story and geographical alterations that should not have happened. In The Fellowship of the Ring, there were scenes like the hobbits' adventures with Tom Bombadil that were completely omitted. This is understandable as it would not have contributed significantly to the story as a whole and, thus, would only be added weight in terms of runtime. Also, minor changes (eg., 'YOU SHALL NOT PASS!' and flashbacks) served to improve the quality of the movie. However, in The Two Towers, things such as Aragorn being shown defeated and near death after the Warg fight (which was a semi-major battle that never occurred in the novel in the first place) are major changes to the plot and tend to harm the movie, especially with fans that love this fantasy series so much. It seemed like a clear attempt to milk the relationship between Aragorn and Arwen to its fullest, while this aspect of the film was not given too much attention in the novel. Additionally, Faramir was shown to be drawn in by the power of the Ring. This bothered me the most because Faramir was quite a good character and one to look up to in the novels. His respect was earned when he immediately showed he was unlike his brother and did not lust after the Ring. Changing Faramir to possess the same traits as Boromir is a bit of an insult. But, like I said earlier, minor changes serve to ameliorate the movie or add as much of the story as possible given the budget and time constraints. Adding an army of elves at the battle of Helm's Deep made the already enthralling action even more so. Having Éowyn present at Helm's Deep as opposed to Dunharrow allowed the heat between her and Aragorn to grow more quickly. Frodo hiding Sam and himself with his cloak in front of the Black Gate added more suspense. Lastly, it must be said that the music played throughout the movie was incredible. The film would not be nearly as impactful without its presence.For the 'everything else' portion, a solid 10. If only the plot had adhered to the novel....

Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," A different animated film.
","As the title says, that was the feeling that I got. The animation, physics, and sounds are quite different from a lot of stuff done before. I was not completely sure what exactly the movie was, but the title gives a good hint. The story was quite sweet and the animation was brilliant and very visual. The dialog fit right in with all the movements of the characters. And there were plenty of moments to laugh. I have not read the book, but if the movie is anything like the book, then every kid (and adult) would have a blast watching the film. I only docked some points for not being quite as satisfying as many other animated films have been. All in all, I was quite content and have very high expectations for the sequel.

Zero Dark Thirty," Very exhilarating!!
","I believed that it was a terrible idea to make this film and, even after having watched and thoroughly enjoyed it, still believe (albeit, to a lesser degree) it might not have been the best idea. Certain things don't need to be publicized. However, the movie itself is terrific. It doesn't matter that all the details may not have been completely accurate. The point was to make a movie about how Bin Laden was captured and they managed to do it well. Every element is well executed and Chastain really made a name for herself (and definitely a fan) with her performance. I really felt like I was part of all the operations taking place. And the level of pride and patriotism evoked is an achievement in itself. Not only that, my heart was pumping throughout and especially towards the end. I would highly recommend this to anyone and would gladly watch it a second and even a third time. Watched 04/05-04/06/2013, written 08/08/2013.",9,3,6,8 August 2013
The Wolf of Wall Street," Probably the best-made film of the year!
","Man, the guys that made this film really know what gets an audience going. There was never a dull moment throughout what initially seems will be an arduously long 3 hours. There was great comedy for every scene that would otherwise be deemed too serious. The movie's long scenes were flawless and attention grabbing. The actors were a troupe of the very best and knew their characters to the core. I am not an employee of Wall Street, but I have some ideas about the way things and ideas flow there. To me, the portrayal was quite honest. Obviously, it was quite flamboyant and exaggerated, especially with respect to the amount of sex and drugs, but this was a movie. It would not have had the same effect if it was toned down. One of the coolest elements I find in films is when the 4th wall is broken. Guess what? Jordan Belfort did it! It was slightly unexpected, but a fantastic surprise. It seemed to me that the crew did a good job of avoiding anachronisms. I did not see any obvious objects, customs, etc. that were out of place. I truly felt immersed into the last few years of the 20th century. I found The Wolf Of Wall Street to be an film with everything! There was comedy, violence, and it had a great plot. This is definitely not one to miss. Give Leo his Oscar already! Some might find a 10 too generous, but I find a 9 to be an injustice. Watched 12/30/2013, written 1/3/2014.",10,2,10,3 January 2014
The Wolverine," Satisfactorily awesome, but not plain awesome.
","I thought I would wait for The Wolverine to come out on DVD before I watched it. But, I went to the theater with my friends and this was the best option. I wish I had waited. The movie is not a superhero movie that's very representative of the brilliant big screen flicks such as The Dark Knight Rises and The Avengers. In short, it could have been better. A couple of things got to me. One being the lack of subtitles during the Japanese dialogues. There was plenty of it and the viewer only understood what was said once Logan asked a bilingual what the words meant. In my mind, subtitles were necessary. Although, to be fair, if the translation was not there, the viewer would be forced to assume that Logan knows Japanese. And that's just hogwash. Additionally, if Wolverine's body heals a lot faster than other mortals, doesn't logic dictate he would not need to sleep? Not sleeping would cause his body to break down, but it would heal anyway. On the upside, there was plenty of comedy to accompany the bad assness of Logan. I would not say this was a badly made film by a long shot; just sub par to what seems to be the expectation from superhero movies. Watched 08/20/2013, written 09/05/2013.",7,3,8,5 September 2013
Monsters University," So much college and nostalgia from the past decade!
","I shall start off by saying that this movie was in no way 'unnecessary' as some overcritical naysayers claim. It was a magnificent prequel to a movie everyone loves. It is quite fitting too because kids that would have watched Monsters, Inc. way back in 2003 are probably of college age now and seeing some of their favorite childhood characters in the same position as they are in now is fantastic (an quite a good way for Pixar to make some money). The college references, while somewhat stereotypical and possibly too focused on Greek life, were fitting and aimed at enhancing the story and not to just highlight what many believe college to be all about. I also loved the creativity that was loaded into this film with regards to the college stuff. 'Scaring major' is just the beginning. All the posters about competitions and dorm life were quite accurate and relatable. With respect to other aspects of the movie, I love the message about teamwork, believing in your team and your friends, acceptance of mistakes, and forgiveness amongst friends. There's a lot that the kids of today (and even the 'grown-up' college kids) can learn from. Of course, this was a prequel to a very loved film from the past decade. There was no way references to the original film would not be present. But, the way the story harked back was what got to me; they were mostly subtle and all in some way that affected the lives of Mike and Sully in their coming years as Scarers. References to previous movies do not get better than this. My only complaint is that it was not as funny as I would have wanted it to be. They did everything well: the animation, the small details, and the distinct personalities for the plethora of characters. But, Pixar, as I have said before, just has not been able to top Finding Nemo in comedy. Maybe that will change soon. Overall, I was very pleased and am very glad Pixar made this film, whatever the reason for it. Watched 02/07-02/08/2014, written 02/08/2014.",8,0,0,7 February 2014
Thor: The Dark World," A vast improvement, but with a lot of room left for more
","First and foremost, I am sad to say that the sequel did not top the original as thoroughly as has been put forth as a general consensus. If anything, they have used elements from the first Thor and simply added a new villain. But, that is breaking it down to its very core element and does not do the film justice. As is expected with big budget superhero movies these days, the special effects were simply flawless and beautiful. The sound guys also worked their magic. The actors (reprising and new) did a terrific job pulling us into the fictional 'Earth', Asgard, and Svartalfheim. Thor, Jane, Odin, Loki, and all the lead characters impress just like they did in 2011. As the baddies, Malekith and his Dark Elves are quite a force to be reckoned with. They were not the types to have a nice meal with. And I liked that quite a lot. Thor was challenged and almost killed on multiple occasions instead of defeating them with a swing and a shock. And Kurse? Now that's a right-hand man a tough baddie like Malekith needs! The fight of the century between him and Hulk would rake in chests upon chests. The little fusses I made for its duration added up, however. For example, Loki's body was simply left behind by Thor. Of course, we discover later that Loki was not killed, but is it not an insult to not bring Loki back to Asgard? And there was a lot of unnecessary dialog intended to pass off as comic relief, but was only obtuse. Things like, 'I better get my pants.' And why would the students in the library not have run away like the rest of their peers right outside when Malekith's ship crashed down instead of making Thor's fight a big celebrity photo shoot? Finally, some of the scenes were not needed, like Selvig's nude terrorism story on the news being shown twice and the double history lesson that could have been summarized into one that was slightly shorter. All in all, entertainment at every step. Watched 04/23/2014, written 04/24/2014.",8,1,1,23 April 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Third one is the best one!
","When movies based on novels are done right, they allow readers to see on screen what they could only imagine in their minds. One of the biggest problems I had with Tolkien's third novel was not being able to visualize Frodo and Sam's adventure concurrently with the stories of Rohan and Gondor. This, of course, is a limitation due to the characteristics of a book and not a criticism of Tolkien. The movie has elongated scenes which focus on one side of the story, but there are critical moments when the stories are totally intertwined (i.e., Aragorn and the rest drawing out the orcs from Mordor to free up Frodo and Sam's passage). And of course, since a movie can tell a story in a shorter time, one does not forget events that occurred at an earlier time.Even though the release dates of the first and third movies were only two years apart, the advancements in technology are clear. The improvements in CGI over the previous films are tremendous. The fantasy creatures like trolls and oliphaunts looked like a natural part of the battlefield. The Army of the Dead looked like they could come and kill some bad guys for us in the 21st century too (although, their duty was completed, so we should leave them alone... even though they were total bad-asses). And all those battle scenes were executed perfectly! I can't imagine the amount of man- hours that must have been put in to accomplish them. Just as the third novel was my favorite of the series, the third film was the best and my favorite of the three. As always, changes were necessary for making this Lord of the Rings film. Happily, however, there were less extreme and damaging changes to the plot as in The Two Towers. The worst offense was Frodo ditching Sam in the film. It showed weakness and lack of trust in their friendship, something that was never a quality in their relationship in the novels. And the Witch King breaking Gandalf's staff served to portray Gandalf the White as mortal. The novels showed he could feel challenged and was not capable of saving Middle Earth by himself, but his staff, one of the major endowments representative of his otherworldliness, was never broken. They did a good job with killing Saruman and Grima earlier on in the story, since the whole ruffian affair in the Shire at the end was (rightfully) omitted.A job well-done adapting the novel for the screen.

The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," More evocative than the first; if only there was a 9.5 option....
","Catching Fire was simply better than the original from 2012. There was so much more emotion provided from the actors; they seemed to really be familiar with every aspect of their characters. Hats off especially to Jennifer Lawrence who always enthralls me with her acting. I also found that I felt a deeper connection with the movie; something that made me realize there was more passion put into this movie. And the omniscient screenplay that allowed us to get a glimpse into the actions of Plutarch (among others) that we did not get to see from Collins was a nice addition. All this being said, I go back to the point I had made about The Hunger Games. If the movie is going to be true to the book, then it should be completely true. Important characters should not be excluded; there should not be alterations to events and reasons for certain events; descriptions of major things like clothing should remain true to what the author sketched out. Obviously, these are minor things that only mean I give this movie a 9.5. But, since that choice is unavailable, I very gladly dish out a 10 over a 9. A marvelous job with the CGI and action sequences. They were never overdone and highlighted the important events. Even though a greater portion of the run time was doled out for the action than allocated in the book, it did not seem like important facets from before the Games were left out. In the book, the pre-Games chapters served to dig deeper into the world of Panem and help set up the remainder of the books. The time allotted to this in the movie was sufficient. In summary, a brilliant job by the whole crew bringing this wonderful trilogy to life. I am thoroughly anticipating both parts of the conclusion.

Spectre," We know what 'C' stands for
","(+) Loads of action, both in car chases and hand-to-hand Classic Bond charm, especially when seducing a recent Italian widow. Classic Bond humor, especially in the car chase scene when he rams into the bumper of 500 and displays his classic nonchalance.(-) There were way too many clichés that are too common. For example, right after the chase scene with Bond in an airplane, he tells White's daughter she should trust him because he's her best chance to stay alive. Oberhauser is the most random bad guy to tie up all of Craig's villains and he is not even a huge presence. Using him as the source for all the other bad guys is terrible retcon and was completely unnecessary. Since when has James Bond hinted at wanting to settle down with the love of his life whom he met about halfway through the movie...?

","Let me start off by saying I am not a fan of the book. I do not completely hate the book, but I was waiting for the end pretty soon after I had begun. However, this movie has done so much in opening my eyes up to the beauty of the book. As such, I prefer the film over the paper version, something quite rare. Given this fine quality, there were plenty of aspects that were not pulled off quite so well, along with some that were quite brilliant. To start off, the music playing at the parties had many modern songs. If that's what they had in the '20s, imagine the stuff we would be listening to in the present. But, while on the subject of music, they made almost the whole film have background music of some sort. One of my biggest complaints with the book was that it was too slow. It's almost as if the crew realized this and put in music for the sluggish parts. Back to a con, if the producers are putting so much money into a film, would they not realize it is important to make sure a shot does not contain a mouth moving without sound emanating from it? It looks like they did not bother because there were plenty of camera angle switches that showed one character moving their mouths after having completed their set of dialog. That was quite frustrating. Of course, there had to be a lot of CGI to give the impression that the audience was truly immersed into the 1920s. But, we are in 2013 and I should not be able to tell when a green screen was used. At least, it should be to a minimum. There were too many times when I compared the movie to stuff from last decade. But, the way in which the movie was shot and presented was quite surreal. I do not know the official term for it, if there is one.Lastly, the whole cast does an absolutely terrific job embodying their respective characters and playing out each scene. It does not seem strained in the slightest. Additionally, the whole team did a marvelous job of keeping the 1920s world intact. Nothing out of the time period seemed to be present. All in all, the movie covered every major event from the book and stuck true to the medium on which it was based. A great job, but not as perfectly executed as it could have been.
