The Blair Witch Project," Terrifying Final 10 Minutes: GREAT!
","Sunday, July 25, 1999The Blair Witch Project - 30 minutes after seeing it! By, BillStoll@aol.comAlright I saw it.  I had to cross the country to Los Angeles. to find a theater showing it.  But I did it. You need to too.There are a hundred summaries of the film's plot on www.imdb.com, so I'll mercifully avoid restating it. My reaction to all the hype follows instead. Here at a Santa Monica, 800 seat  theater near L.A., the show was sold out 'seven shows' in advance.  We wound up going to Sunday night's 9:50 PM showing (that's about 1 PM, east coast).  And it was worth the wait and navigating through the packed (large!) theater's audience.  Which I hate to do, generally speaking.A comment first about movie's quality.  The home movie (shaky camera; crappy images) thing got on my nerves eventually, as I thought it might . . . until the last ten minutes or so, when the movie pays off.  Trust someone who has seen a lot of horrr films in his day: You will be freaked out by its closing minutes.  Oh yeah.   . . . it paints the face of fear like you've never seen it before, then goes on to chronicle it, bringing you along for the ride as it wraps up the story in a neat little package.Great essays open and close to the same central thesis.  Listen closely to the opening small town dialog (about the Blair Witch legends) from the Burkittsville MD residents.  In particular, to Mary Brown, one of the creepier castings the creators of this film arranged.  It is a clean story, from back to front. Stories like that are what movies should be all about.There are a hundred things to pick apart regarding the film's manufacture, particularly if you're a fussbudget viewer like myself ( . . . did I actually write that about moi?!).  But therein lies the genius of the home movie / college-student approach.  You forgive the flaws because the participants and their amateur process (in their fear) surely could have taken the tack portrayed.  Anyone reading this ever truly get 'lost in the woods?'  I have (35 years ago albeit) and it is scary.  Damned scary!  So: to the major criticism assigned by the internet reviewers about it being unrealistic for anyone - under those conditions - to continue filming, my take was that they needed to do 'something' to preserve their sanity in their hopelessness and terror.  The alternative: to give up, wither and die frightened and unproductive in the woods.  The prospective flaws (I saw) were the absence of a cell phone or a search party perhaps.  However, even as I write this now (late, after getting back to my hotel,) my own cell phone is miles away in my daughter's car trunk, forgotten by yours truly. So anything's possible.Do I recommend it?  (Fargo Voice) Oh, you betcha Margie!  It is only 80 minutes or so long; you get a kick out of it at first . . . well, up until those last ten big ones.  And those, my friends, are - all by themselves - worth the trip.Don't worry about sleeplessness after seeing it.  Unless you're prone to camping, hiking or living near the woods now or anytime in the future.See it when it comes to a theater near you.BillStoll@aol.com",Null,1,1,27 July 1999
Miracle," This is the Rocky of Hockey, with a better ending yet!
","9 / 10.  This is the Rocky of Hockey, with a better ending.  Tampa hosted a sneak preview.   The line to get in was long, akin to the Saturday matinee lines I remember from the 50s.  Miracle gives you more value for your movie dollar than any alternative playing today, if smiling all the way home is a goal.Ironically, Miracle underscores that hard work, discipline, focus and `wanting it badly enough' is what it takes to win - everything EXCEPT a miracle in fact.  Super stars - the most talented - aren't the ingredients that get the job done.  Unification of the human spirit - developing the will to win - is by far the more important element.Kurt Russell is brilliant.  Patricia Clarkson (wife) peppers sage advice that influences Herb's thinking and his evolution as a coach.  Listen to her words.  The team members were unknown actors (to me).  But just as they were the right players for the team in Brooks' view, every one was the right actor for the film.The demand for Herb Brooks' autobiography will skyrocket.  This is a man of vision, whose mind records an opponent's vulnerability so that he can compete and win against it.  He has this innate understanding of how a coach molds solid individual talent into a team . . . a family.  Every smart CEO across the land will use metaphors and clips from this great film to inspire their corporate personnel to go and do likewise.  I know this because it happened with Hoosiers; Miracle is Hoosiers-on-steroids (quite possibly the most inappropriate sports simile ever written :-).The hockey play is superbly choreographed.  The psychology of the game - as well as the heart and mind of the player  - is explored in depth.  You can't help but learn the mechanics of the game along the way.  Whether a current hockey fan or not, you'll better understand the game two hours after the the film starts, an unintentional benefit.This film made me 'prouder YET' to be an American.  To live in a land that produces the likes of Herb Brooks and this caliber of cinderella team.  My blood was pumping.  I suddenly wanted to be in better shape; vowed to be more focused on goals in my own life.  I knew these games occurred many years ago, but the movie made me feel like it all happened yesterday.
Don't exit too quickly unless knowing what the players are doing now is unimportant.  Go see it the day it opens and pass the buzz.",10,0,0,1 February 2004
Ali," ... a glimpse into the kind of man Cassius Clay became, and why
","Two actors have the talent and focus to pull off Mohammed Ali:  Will or Denzel.  Will did it, and superbly.  He will be nominated.If you love boxing and digging deep into the fabric of a complex character  this is the film for you.  165 minutes flew by for me.  It's not Rocky; it's not a typical sports movie.  It's a glimpse into the kind of man Cassius Clay became, and why.  No matter what `life path' one takes, there are toll booths along the way.  This film puts you there, in those booths, for better and for worse as Ali career unwinds.The relationship with Howard Cossell (Jon Voigt  Nomination!) is dissected with strategic snapshots from their time together.  Angelo Dungee is passively presented until an interview just prior to the Rumble in the Jungle.  Then we discover less is more' as Ali describes the bond he has for the man in a single, well-timed sentence.  Likewise, we see Ali at home  Before During and After fame hits.The best advice to Ali came from John Lennon.  Paraphrasing, `When it gets real, that's when it really gets unreal.'  See the film and that line will drop right into place for you.  7 / 10.",7,0,0,26 December 2001
Minority Report," Rife with clever Spiebergian invention!
","52 years hence, life on earth is still recognizable and different.  The storyboards required to convert Philip Dick's story to film had to cover every wall in the Spielberg household.   He impresses as the kind of director obsessed with perfection whether at home, at work or wherever he is breathing air.  Were it not so long, this film would be flawless.It's rife with clever Spiebergian inventions.  The 2054 products, foods, institutions and the toys he preserves are all favorites of mine ... evolved for the changing times.  Butcher-run, ghettoized `eyeball swap' shops have replaced back-alley abortion clinics, in this case, one operated by Peter Stormare (Fargo!) who is truly in his element here.  The dialog is smart, economical and funny.  It syncs with the likable, highly plausible Cruise, Van Sydow and Morton (et al) characters.  Scientific advances have drained the supply of miracles people need; hope is on the wane.  And yet the common cold persists uncured.  The story weaves 100 such elements of life on planet earth as an entertaining backdrop.  Watch closely to 95% of them.  Five viewings may be necessary to catch them all.The plot deals with 3 people gifted with pre-cognition (seeing things before they occur), with a focus on murder.  The Wash DC cops have a pre-crime division to act on their visions.  Wash DC thus now has the lowest murder rate in the country.  The PreCogs ability to see murder but not a non-murder crime is plausibly explained (a death tears the fabric of life, whereas another crime creates but a ripple in the cloth). The plot, the characters  they all work . . . I even liked the music (classic John Williams). 
Cruise is at his best since Eyes Wide Shut and Risky Business.So first see Bourne Identity which earned a 10 from me; then see Minority Report on the big screen (9) because it'll lose impact on DVD.",Null,0,0,22 June 2002
Monster," ... a monstrously successful outcome at the Oscars for Charlize
","I loved this movie!  10 / 10:  I'm holding nothing back.  I don't think it's necessarily going to be good for the whoring business along interstates in Florida mind you, but it made one riveting on-screen story.  'Charlize Theron: You've done it!'  I've followed her career since 'That Thing You Did'.  At first I thought her evil twin was cast in error.  She was on FIRE! Brilliant.  Scary.  Perfecto.Charlize had been script fodder to me . . . filler . a pretty face, nice body to draw the men but without talent of (say) Meryl Streep's caliber. A few more `reach roles' will be necessary to hit Meryl's stride, but she's on her way.  Independent film tends to draw the best from an actor's ability, taking payroll cash out of the equation.  It separates pretty, rich faces from the talented pretty, rich faces.  That should be a right of passage for any wannabe star.Now why every theater in Tampa isn't vying to show this film (limited distribution in Tampa at least) is beyond me.  Yes, this is Florida, and sure - the real Aileen did her felonious mischief only 97 miles away.  But if Psycho was mainstream in 1962, surely 41 years later a real psychotic's behavior is fair game today.The F word is used more often than in Scarface; lesbian sex a/k/a male heaven is prominent (keep the kiddies home), and I think the woman behind me in the theater viewed it as a training video based on her unsolicited commentary of the action.  The genre is somewhere between Thelma and Louise, Psycho and Star Trek . . . the latter because it boldly goes where Patty Jenkins hadn't gone before.  A monstrously successful outcome at the Oscars do I predict for Charlize.  Did I mention this was a 10 out of 10?",10,0,0,27 January 2004

The Rookie," ... best picture about baseball since Redford whacked The Natural our way ...
","This is the best picture about baseball since Redford whacked The Natural our way.  Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths light up the screen with a great story and a cast that seemed real enough to pull you into their lives. 
Laced with dreams - dripping in reality, the American Dream reignites after 9.11 with a true story about the Devil Ray's mid-life rookie, Jimmy Morris. Australian born actress, Rachel Griffiths, plays a native West Texan better than a lot of Texans I know; and Dennis Quaid was perfection  cast as the wannabe, gonnabe and humble winner with as much psychological baggage as the average viewer in the audience.  It's real.  The on-screen chemistry works. If you like baseball heart-warmers, you're going to love this film.  The ingredients for Americana and apple pie were all in there.  My popcorn became the a la mode'.  And hey: buy the CD!  The music rocks and carries the story magnificently! Syncing words and music pushes the story forward exactly the way it should, an area that disappoints me more often than not.Criticisms:  I'd have given the baseball to somebody else. But Quaid has something to teach us all about character' and heart.  St. Rita and the nuns were a nice decoration, but they never really found their place in the story to open and close around them.  A little long.  Worth every minute in the last analysis.  8 / 10.",8,1,1,31 March 2002
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," this film has it all . . . !
","It's funny : there's chemistry : outstanding writing :  this film has it all.  Kate Hudson and super stardom are on destiny's path (so much charisma... )  Bebe Neuwirth, always a treasure on screen.  This is the best date flick since Sleepless in Seattle.  Everything works (and I hate Date Flicks as a rule - shallow).  If it's formulaic, the formula's a new one and promises a fresh new future for the genre.  Screenwriters Kristen Buckley, Brian Regan and  Burr Steers deserve much of the credit; though director Donald Petrie gets the credit for putting it all together.  See it as soon as you can.",10,0,0,25 January 2003
Sleepy Hollow," . . . it breeds new meaning for `Watch your head!'
","Sleepy Hollow Reviewed by Bill StollI'll admit it:  I never read the original Washington Irving story.  Cliffs Notes covered the topic perfectly back when I was in school.  So I critiqued this work `exclusively' on its film merit    . . . as I should anyway. 
Ever wonder where the phrase: `Spinning the truth' comes from?  (it's a good political year for 'that!')  This film tells you with a charming childhood metaphor threaded throughout the story.  It breeds new meaning for `Watch your head!' and that perky invitation `Who wants to go along?'   It's a laugh fest if you listen closely.The acting is terrific.  Johnny Depp `IS' Ichabod Crane, a tribute to his diverse `character acting' skill.   He surpassed my expectation; and I expect a lot from the man.  In tandem with the oft 'head-free' Christopher Walken, they reclassified the film as 'riveting' for me.  Miranda Richardson delivers a brilliant Lady Van Tassel  - both naughty and nice ( . . . and no more about 'that' till you've seen it!)  Christina Ricci is a great love interest for the eccentric Constable Crane.  She's come a long way from Mermaids (where she first hit my list).Despite all the head lopping, it isn't that scary.  (That from a guy in his 40s.  For the 11 year olds, it might carry quite a different SQ [scare quotient]!)  There are a couple of fright spots, but I had deeper chills from Ghostbusters, like the library scene, e.g.  This is a well told story where I reasonably anticipated what the screen delivered, yet enjoyed every moment of the ride without drifting.  For those who know me, this is a major accomplishment.  Distraction could be my middle name.  But not here.Director Tim Burton is now the undisputed King of Gothic.  Absolutely.  From his Batman to Edward Scissorhands to Ed Wood, he infuses gloom into my mood like nobody else can.  It pushes me into the right frame of mind for his movies.  The gothic feel here would make Batman himself envious.  He holds tenaciously to the look until the problem at hand is eliminated.   And then, guess what?!  What a talent. If you need detail on the story, do what I should have 30 years ago.  Read the book (or I'll lend you my Cliffs notes).  But for a wild ride on a galloping horse, see this movie.  3 out of 4 stars.  Check it out.",Null,0,0,19 November 1999
Closer," Remarkable. Raw and True.
","Two pivotal ideas make this film memorable: Clever euphemisms and (conceptually) 'the moment' of change. When exactly does someone fall in love? How does someone? Euphemisms weave their way throughout the dialog, tossing four people ragged on the seas of love without dramamine, to discover The Moment. Closer  the title itself  is euphemistically used to help me understand the moment in the games people play en route to falling into and out of love. Nothing is held back. No bridling. Passion and emotional turmoil are served up raw. That Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts are the female objets'desire drew me in from frame one (and there's Jude Law and Clive Owen for the ladies - no worries). Unless ice water flows through your veins, you'll get Closer to the work of Mike Nichols - who started down this path with Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolff four decades ago, his first and best gem. Enjoy! I did. 8 out of 10.",Null,5,8,14 December 2004
The Bourne Identity," If there's something not to like, it'll take another viewing or two to discover it
","Finally . . . a thriller that actually thrills.  Everyone I spoke to before seeing it expected Matt Damon to wash out as Jason Bourne.  `Too young; lacks a debonair quality and doesn't have Sean Connery's style.  Not only does Damon deliver the goods, his chemistry with Franka Potente (Marie) will make her a hot US commodity to follow her impressive European credentials. Chris Cooper shines Â– a superb character actor always.  It's expertly written with sharp repartee and clever dialog.  If there's something not to like, it'll take another viewing or two to discover it.  Orlando's Incredible Hulk roller coaster was the last entertainment vehicle to deliver this afternoon's thrill quotient.  Grab a date and see it now.  Now I say! . . . 10.",Null,0,1,16 June 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," . . . a magnificent screen epic with inspired photography . . .
","The Lord of the Rings is many things, but not a 9.6 out of 10 film as listed with 7 thousand recorded IMDB votes.  Director Peter Jackson is a genius, as are many who appear in the film.  It is a magnificent epic with inspired photography; an entertaining Sci-Fi adventure brimming with countless dangers and (nearly) as many narrow escapes; and it honors well J.R.R. Tolkien's enduring masterpiece.  It is chockful of my favorite actors, performing as well as I've ever seen them in many cases . . . Cate Blanchett, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving and the Ians Holm and McKellen among them.  The spoke soliloquies so often.  After nearly 3 hrs of watching, I did not bond as a viewer with any of them, and found myself rooting for the heroic success of no one.  The film lacked heart . . . character chemistry - as super-star-salaried sports teams often are, resulting in their inability to win the big game.I give this film a respectable 7, a fine rating for any movie and a rating that contemplates its strengths with its limitations.  There is a lot to like about it and two more 'in the can' episodes yet to be seen.  But be reasonable: To bump Gone with the Wind, Godfather(s) I and II, and Citizen Kane with a 9.6 is a little nutty in a theater where no tears fell for any of the vanquished, except perhaps for those funding this and the sequels. So who is stuffing the ballot box with 10s, and why?  See it during your next free three hour span.  Just don't expect the most perfect movie ever made.",7,0,0,21 December 2001
The Village," Menz a menz . . . Not M. Night's best
","Classic Shyamalan drama ( wait for the ending!)  6 out of 10.  Slow drama. I guessed the ending 20 minutes into it.  This film will not setting box office records this weekend.Best:  Acting.  Bryce Howard is excellent.  Brody, Phoenix and Weaver are good as always.  Hurt overacts as though on a Shakespearian  as expected.Worst:  Slow.  Overloaded with Blair Witch drama and the Basic Instinct transition music.  At one point I almost hoped Basic Instinct would take over.M.Night's signature surprises (endings) I may've walked away after those first 20 minutes.   My  intention to see Bryce Dallas Howard (of Ron Howard notoriety) act - kept me seated.  Good movie to see on DVD.  Maybe it's 5 out of 10 on second thought.",Null,0,0,31 July 2004
Cold Mountain," I'll bet Charles Frazier has to be as pleased with the translation of his extraordinary work ...
","A brilliant film.   The book was fresh, original and `tight' as stories go. On film, it's the best love story since West Side Story.  There's plenty of killin' and explosions to keep the story moving for the guys.  If Minghella decides to release a 3 hour director's cut, I will buy a copy.  Seinfeld had fewer eccentric characters than this gem.  I did not want it to end.  And then it did  brilliantly again.Every actor hit their marks.  Kidman has been exceptional for years Jude Law finds his talent here.  Both will get nominations.  Supporting: Zellweger, Portman and Hoffman are brilliant  Brilliant!  especially Zellweger and Hoffman.  Renee's worth the price of admission all by her lonesome.  Cold Mountain is a beautiful place to be.  True love is a beautiful thing to have.   Against the backdrop of war's horror  the brief life spans of the day  the inability of mail getting through, forcing those starving for a lover's words to cling to a single sentence, or a memory when words are unavailable  . . . these are things to be treasured.   Only those with dry-ice frosting in their veins can't see it.Favorite parts:  That the characters think / speak like they would in the era (as I imagine it anyway).   1860s South.  Zellweger and Hoffman are best in supporting roles.  The war is portrayed as realistically as I've ever seen it.  The war photography is gritty  real  the war action is painful and morally split - like a bayonet to the gut.   Remedies to repair damaged flesh are fresh out of Granny Clampett's doctorin' bag.  Dirty fingernails: the standard of the day.   I'll bet Charles Frazier is as pleased with the translation as I am.  10 / 10.",10,1,1,26 December 2003
American Psycho," The double entendre dialogue is a delight. Effectively advancing the story throughout.
","American PsychoLoved it.  Anyone seeking a traditional horror movie on par with Urban Legends, Scream and movies of that kind will likely be disappointed with this film.  This movie fits into a category best described as psychological horror perfected with a black comedy garnish.  It presents the deterioration of main character Patrick Bateman's (played by Christian Bale) sanity; and his descent from a thread-bare lifeline to the real world.  Summing: It's bloody good.The film is littered with clues about what is really happening on-screen. The viewer has to watch/listen carefully indeed to catch it all.  The story is expertly told by Director Mary Harron, based Bret Easton-Ellis' book. She unveils evidence of what is really going on in measured doses, but I did not fully `get it' until the end.  I will be eagerly awaiting Mary's next production based on this work.It is a film for the '90s, dealing with and cleaning up possible consequences from the unstable mind after the decadent 80s on Wall Street. On its face, it is a brutal tale in what might slide into a Slasher Genre. But (as with American Beauty) LOOK CLOSER!  The critical question: `Have you ever let your mind wander about how you might resolve an adversarial situation if there was no possibility of getting caught?'  Magnify those `mind meanderings' by a factor of 100 to reflect slipping from sanity.  This movie's premise explores that avenue completely.  It is handled in a creative, entertaining way for horror fans.The double entendre dialogue was the most enjoyable part for me.  Normally reserved for comedy, it is used as an effective device in this throughout. Listen carefully to what Patrick Bateman says, and to how it is answered by an opposing character on-screen.  The clues regarding what is actually happening on-screenare everywhere.  But stay alert.  Miss nothing.  Good advice.Christian Bale and Willem Dafoe portray thoroughly believable characters. And Chloe Sevigny - always the consummate actress - executes an extraordinary submissive administrative assistant role as Jean.  (She has been a favorite of mind ever since the movie Kids.)It will never dethrone a mainstream, horror classic like Hitchcock's Psycho, but this film will find its niche with devotees of the psychological horror thriller.  My recommendation is to see this film not once - but (at least) twice.  PS:  Not the world's best `Date Movie,' by the way, unless two horror fans are on the prowl for interesting fare.  Enjoy.",10,0,0,23 November 2000

Moulin Rouge!," If you're looking for a story to fall into and let a well-told fairy tale pull you in . . . this is your kind of film.
","Outstanding Film.  It was a different kind of movie  . . . though I could see why the more conventional critics low-balled the ratings.  It was on-screen for over 2 hours after all; yet not a single alien threatened our planet - and terrorists failed to blow up Paris.  Your imagination was thrown into high gear instead.  This a different kind of movie-escapism. 
The movie will likely breed a play down the road instead of the other way around.  Totally original: From the director's style, to his power zooms, to the camera's unique and roving perspective.  It's a wild ride that'll take several viewings to fully absorb.Cautions:  If Bohemian life styles bother you, see something else.  If song and dance ain't yo'thang, stay home.  Now if you're looking for a story to fall into and let a well told fairy tale pull you in . . . this is your kind of film.  Baz Luhrmann and Co did nothing familiar or formulaic.  They dissected the lyrcis from 6 great rock songs and assembled 3 magical acts from it.  This is funny, poignant . . . perfect!

Wimbledon," Fun. Entertaining. You'll like it!
","An unexpected delight. It's the Rocky of tennis, with a twist.In Rocky, Trainer Mickey advises love-struck Rocky with 'Women weaken legs!'Wimbleton's wisdom - 28 years after Rocky I - is that 'Boy get strong - does well - showing off for girl'. Either way, it's fun to watch and a good inside look at the ways and means of Wimbleton.Hey Spiderman: Watch out! Kirstin Dunst and Paul Bettany are a hot item here. Their chemistry works. Jon Favreau plays a completely believable whored-up agent with a strong 'despicability quotient'. James McAvoy (new to my movie going experience) is the younger brother of Paul Bettany. He delivers convincing sibling rivalry to a dysfunctional-anyway Colt-household. Everyone else in the cast is fodder for those big 4. They're all good. No one is hogging lines or camera time. It works. It entertains. Not too much thinking is involved, making it a good date film.7 out of 10. Would be more if they broke new ground. Maybe next time.",Null,1,1,17 September 2004
Mulholland Drive," It's about the performances everyone gives as we walk through life ...
","Mulholland Drive steps above and around normal linear logic of movie making. Lynch leads us down a winding path of dreams buried deep within Betty's (protagonist's) subconscious.  At first, he serves up a series of linear (apparently disconnected) plot lines which make sense on their own.  No overall pattern surfaces (that I could see anyway). Two drop dead gorgeous female characters endear themselves to us so completely that - by the time the film turns psychotic in those last 30 minutes - I was so attached to them I'd follow them wherever the film led me.Then those last 30 minutes.  When Lynch shuffles the deck . he re-orders reality so that all of my opening assumptions are completely reversed or erased (depending on the scene). On the surface things make less sense; but on a deeper, emotional level, you see that it makes `profound' sense. The genius is depicting on film that purgatory space between consciousness and sleep, reason and psychosis.  I can never quite remember my dreams, but a Lynch film provides the elusive record of the universal dream world lurking within us all (I hope).It's about the performances everyone gives as we walk through life, driven by our needs, wants and fears.  Hollywood favors the caricature life and likely drives the odd actor-wannabe to psychotic depths.  This is that waking nightmare imaginatively delivered on film. (It may be autobiographical, but that is for Lynch to reveal on Oprah or Today).A love story gracefully develops within the story's pre-psychotic twists and turns.  Sure it becomes darker than most; but then again, some do.  This director knows how to strike the base human chord in all of us.
It's not for someone looking for standard Hollywood fare.  It's a film the Nick character in the Big Chill would have counseled  `has to flow over you'.  Except here, you've got to be at least reasonably analytical.Naomi Watts - a newcomer to my radar screen holds the film together brilliantly.  She has a tremendous future in Hollywood, an unintended oxymoron for the film's main character no doubt.  It demands a second watching.  I'll submit to the call. For surreal, it beats the daylights out of Vanilla Sky.",Null,1,2,28 September 2002
Black Hawk Down," It's an action film from first frame to last.
","This is the only movie I've ever seen where I could leave to urinate, wash my hands, come back to my seat and they were still shooting the enemy non-stop.  The pyrotechnic and ammunition budget for this film had to have exceeded what Cecil B. DeMille invested to part the Red Sea.  It's an action film from first frame to last.  And its timing could not be better for a patriotic America.As a study of the intimate realities of war, it could be a training reel for the U.S. Military.  It impacts with the wallop imparted by  'Death on the Highway', a high school film Driver's Ed served up to kids learning to drive in the 60s and 70s.  Blackhawk Down offers a brief segment of a thirty minute 'incursion/extraction' operation gone awry as they sometimes do  due to the many unpredictable variables in hostile territory.As a film study, it dissects a 36  hour of real life as a Ranger / Special Forces task force.   I empathized with every soldier and the gritty reality of their task as well as the intensity of their commitment; but the absence of backstory prevented me from becoming emotionally attached to any of them, an impact directors often hope to achieve.  If you like action, nothing could be better!  For a full-bodied storyline packed with reality to boot, stick with Saving Pvt. Ryan.  Enjoy!  6 / 10.",6,0,0,19 January 2002
Big Fish," Big fish grabs you: Hook, line and sinker.
","It's the life of a salesman wrapped in a fairy tale that absolutely delights.  The premise:  If you knew how you were going to die  . . . what you'd be doing, where you'd be, who you'd be with at the moment of passing  how would you live?  Would you shun that situation like the plague; be the bravest guy in town in all other things?   Big Fish earned an 8 / 10 from me for taking me down that road.This salesman (Finney) is a salesman / storyteller distanced from his son ostensibly for telling tall tales and stepping on the kid's moments growing up.  So what did that salesman see in that witch's eye when he was a kid anyway?Listen, who hasn't dressed the facts to dress an otherwise boring story? This is a film about perspective  perspective in life.  If 3 people are in a 7-11 hold-up, the police will hear multiple versions of `what happened' sure as shootin'.  Your eyes - my eyes (your mind vs. mine) see events uniquely based on the sum of our personal experiences.  Positive, negative, surrealistic spins come into play.  The raconteur's art is his voice, passion; the details told vs. intrigue born by those withheld  it all counts.  Stories retold consistently become myth; myth : legend.  If you believe the legend, you're psychotic or blessed, depending on your audience's perspective.  Big Fish teaches you how to do it right.On that `10' scale, more than one `5' and `6' moments come along.  A stingier editor would have decorated the floor with many more frames.  But those cuts would have been a mistake.  Its ending works (ranking a `20' on that 10 scale) because the story meanders.  Big fish had me hook, line and sinker.",Null,0,0,18 January 2004
The Last Samurai," 'They Are Perfect.' 10!

National Treasure," An entertaining matinée movie. See it!
","You'll be pleasantly surprised if you see this movie without expecting too much. It's entertaining, good Saturday-matinée material. It reminded me of an Indiana Jones romp, updated for the repartee of the average 'Alias' episode. In fact, a genealogical study might reveal linkage between Alias' Marshall Flinkman and NT's Riley Poole. One mold for those two.The formula for this movie will permit as many sequels as viewers are willing to pay to see. Any icon, symbol or event that could be misinterpreted or misunderstood is what makes the movie work. For National Treasure I, the back of the dollar bill, secret societies (reborn in The DaVinci Code) and a good conspiracy theory unleashes a plot line. 'National Treasure 5' might take the Microsoft Logo, the 'you've got mail' voice and a conspiracy theorist to discover Elvis lives on. Whatever... it yields a grand chase scene that wiles away two hours with good, old-fashioned, don't-think-too-much entertainment.And that's EXACTLY what I was in the mood to see this particular Saturday afternoon! 7 out of 10.",Null,0,0,20 November 2004
A Beautiful Mind," A Beautiful Mind is a beautiful movie. . .
","I saw this film without reading the book or speaking to someone who had seen it.  Other than reading this advice, for maximum bang for your entertainment dollar, do it the exact same way.  All the twists and turns will be that much more enjoyable.  Jennifer Connelly, Russell Crowe, Ed Harris are terrific.  The make-up artists get kudoes, as do the editors and casting directors.  Okay, throw in a huge kudo for Ron H. who did it again.  Opie rules. 
So many excellent films came out at year end, it's easy to overlook one. Don't overlook this one.  A Beautiful Mind is a beautiful movie.  9/ 10.",9,0,1,27 December 2001
War of the Worlds," Vintage Spielberg ... from its subtle humor to its child's-eye perspective
","You will love it! Tom Cruise, Dakota Fanning, and Tim Robbins are the heart and soul characters that make it all work. H G Wells' famous tale is converted into a 'coming of age' film here, courtesy of Mr. Spielberg.Specifically coming of age are Cruise's son Robbie (Justin Chatwin) and daughter Rachel (Dakota Fanning) (who delivers the best one liners in the film). Ray Ferrier (Cruise) seeks only to protect his family; son Robbie seeks only revenge, first against his Dad and vicariously next against the aliens. Eventually, Robbie joins the battle that his father knows we cannot win. Spielberg touches a modern nerve here in this doomsday scenario.He delivers a 'war' that immerses the audience's angst of natural disasters, terrorist attacks and the anarchy that would logically result when life loses its balance Â– all delivered under dark, dreary skies. The film invests winning elements of Independence Day and Men in Black (without as much delightful repartee - regrettably). It's on par with both as an entertainment barometer.Tim Robbins is brilliant (!) as the hospitable nemesis, Ogilvy. At one point, he declares: 'This is not a war. This is an Extermination,' with his flare for extracting all that is bleak and pessimistic from a situation. It's a great role filled by the perfect player.This is vintage Spielberg, from its subtle humor to its child's-eye perspective. For example, as the city is being trashed by the aliens, the camera pans a 'No Littering' sign. The initial attack yields dialog like 'Â… is it the terrorists again, Daddy?' And you learn that the average Dodge Caravan is every bit as durable as a Hummer when TriPod machinery is at the height of its vicious attack. No one captures a child's terror and reactions better than Spielberg's lens. He's the Master.Cruise throws only one tantrum on screen involving an unwarranted peanut butter sandwich. Glib as this standalone scene is, it refreshed my memory of his Today Show antics opposite Matt Lauer on issue of 'dealing with psychological imbalance, drug-free'. I think he could have used a pill.When the moment is right, like the story magician he is, Mr. Spielberg taps his magic wand and wraps up the fairy tale for the fantasy ride it has beenÂ…a bit too unbelievably as you will see for yourself - which is why it earns an 8 instead of a 10. See it soon.",8,3,17,29 June 2005
Love Actually," ... a christmas classic, out of the chute!
","Finally something fresh for Christmas.  Sure, it takes 20 years to determine whether a film becomes a classic.  Trust me: the ingredients are there: Character chemistry, fresh writing, memorable antics ... It's a feel good film and a mirror for whether you've got the right stuff in your own love life.  'Classic,' agreed Frank Capra's spirit, 'just in time for (every) Christmas.'It's the first chick flick (they make no bones about it) that's 2 hours 8 minutes long where 'No One' gets killed and 'nothing' explodes that I actually liked.  Scratch that. ... Loved Actually!If you miss it in the theater (huge mistake), know you'll be seeing it again for decades to come right around this time of year.  ... enjoy.",Null,18,31,1 November 2003
Vanilla Sky," Bring your imagination, intellect and your sense of wonder to this film, along with a date.
","Bring your imagination, intellect and your sense of wonder to this film, along with a date if someone's handy.  You will need all four  the latter critical to talk through your impressions and the film's possibilities over a nice café mocha after the show.  It's not another date movie of the kind Hollywood routinely churns out. There's a lot to like about this movie.  It demands to be watched 'Closely!' Open your eyes . . .  (where'd I here that?)   Now there's nothing wrong with shallow fare like say 'Something about Mary' and 'Shallow Hal'.  To all flicks, a purpose.  Those are frolicks.  This one is more akin to philosophical lecture, where the professor insists you learn by immersing yourself in the experience.  Each has entertainment value.  This one simply demands your full attention to Get It.  The only hokey thing about the movie is the Cameron-Cameron / Cruise-Cruz thing.  That aside, it blazes bravely into Kubrickian surrealistic territory, a risky departure from the entertaining, mainstream achievements of Mr. Crowe to date . . . Virtually anything he slaps up on the screen will attract an audience by reputation and prior achievements.  Know that this one is a journey worth taking, if you bring at least 3 of the 4 elements first noted above.  Criticism: It could easily have been clipped 20 minutes and retain every bit of its storyline, character development and film personality.  I suppose with three blockbuster successes decorating his resume, Cameron (Crowe) likely earned his editorial license.  Length mattered.  Why not 120 minutes now; and 150 on the redux 20 years hence, like Coppola did it.  This film will become a classic. Whether 120 or 150, I liked them all.  Check it out.",9,0,0,14 December 2001
Amélie," The most perfect film I've seen this year. Watch it with your heart wide open.
","Amelie is a magnificent comedy about life.  It's about following your heart in pursuit of true love; it's about helping others to discover themselves  for better or for worse  to improve their own lives; and it's a `how to' course about mobilizing the dysfunctionality in your life to make the world a better place.  All of that and it's an original (*) to boot.Amelie is about the art of living.  Art surrounds us, yet many believe it is only to be found in museums, galleries and the souls of the artistic.  There is art in every one of us.  Amelie attracts it like a magnet.(*) One critical footnote on the originality pitch.  There was one minor sequence borrowed from a Parade Magazine (Sunday Newspaper, several years back) article where someone borrowed' a garden decoration, took it on vacation and returned it afterwards.  That aside, thoroughly original.Amelie is a wonderful and beautiful actress named Audrey Tautou who is going to be awfully busy in the decades upcoming.  The cast around is superb to boot.The most perfect film I've seen this year.  Watch it with your heart wide open.  9 / 10.",9,0,1,19 December 2001
The Sixth Sense," Wanna See Dead People?
","'I see Dead People!'  Sixth Sense is well worth the ticket price.  It's a tight story and the acting is outstanding.  There are a couple of good scares, rendered more effective because I dropped my guard.  My sixth sense says such was the Writer/Director's express intention. :-)It's a ghost story yet doesn't rely on special effects and computerization to chill your bones as the Haunting tried to do.  The scares come from the sliver of possibility 'what is happening may be true.'  Well that, and the dropping your guard thing.Everyone in the cast is outstanding.  Bruce Willis is at his best since Die Hard and The Last Boy Scout.   His patient is 33 years junior to him ( played by Haley Joel Osment) is outstanding.  Truly.  I was mesmerized by his ability to get into this 'sixth sense' possessed character.  Malcolm and Cole helping each other resolve their problems occurs with good chemistry, and is believable, despite the heights you have to take your mind to believe the story's premise. I am sooo tempted to give clues on when to grip the one you're with or arms rests a little more tightly; but alas, cannot in good conscience (or for fear of hate mail!)  And out of respect for M. Night Shyamalan for a very good script and story thesis.Summing: if you're 'only' looking for the Chill Factor, take in Blair Witch over this one for those final 10 minutes.  The reality factor is stronger, both despite and because of the low budget factors.  But if you want to see one of the best Hollywood manufactured horror films in a long time, give Sixth Sense a chance.  I enjoyed it.",8,104,147,6 August 1999
Thirteen Days," The Godfather of political thrillers. Magnificent!
","This is The Godfather of political thrillers.   Magnificent!  Until the final frames - when JFK addresses the White House staff - I expected another critical problem to emerge.  These `wrinkles' kept me perched on the edge of my seat.  I was naïve and 11 at the time.  This is a movie not to be missed.The President's Special Assistant (Kenny O'Donnell aka Kevin Costner) tells the story.  He connects you intimately to the Kennedy White House, the early 60s military machinery  balanced against faith and family.  Every emotion kicks into gear over the course of the film.  At the end of the day, you're thankful the man in the oval office was a smart fellow.  We need smart people in that office.  There's a thing called `heart' sprinkled liberally throughout.  Performances are thoroughly believable, as though this is unfolding here and now. Greenwood and Culp are plausible Kennedy brothers after all their predecessors, a tough job given the liberal supply of Kennedy film.  Your heart pours out for the insiders who knew how close the world came to the brink.  Then please, join me in becoming a little cynical about the government's `world safety' report veracity going forward.  Thirteen Days shows you why the government, the press, and the people need to be in constant check and balance to be effective.A football metaphor weaves effectively through the film, though the teams are cliquish at best.  Ex-Harvard quarterback Kenny O'Donnell now serves as a linebacker for the Kennedy team.   He's an insider; close  a (near-family) friend.   In a crisis, loyalty and teamwork to America's quarterback (JFK) is the prescription for sanity.  War zealots surround and abound.  Someone needs the cooler head  to be the wiser man  in a world where warfare is being redefined with weapons of annihilation.Minutia:  There's always something for a fanatic like me.  I spotted a bowl of Post's fruity Pebbles cereal at the O'Donnell breakfast table in the closing minutes.  I don't think these had been invented yet.  The thing is: If I have to dig `that deep' to find flaws with the film's presentation quality, it's a pretty darned good.  I am sure there are historical flaws, but this is close enough for government work.I'm still naïve, but no longer 11 years old.  Movies have to be well made / well told to satisfy.  An entertainment adventure you will enjoy no matter your age, gender, race, religion or political persuasions.  It rates 9 out of 10 possible points.  But unlike its Godfather intensity, I hope there's never a sequel to this one.",9,37,49,18 January 2001
Cinderella Man," He's a natural talent, with new motivation!
","It's about hope, surviving despair with integrity, and a 'natural talent' exercising his god given talent for boxing.The acting is terrific by Crowe, Zellweger and Giamatti as expected.... But make room for Craig Bierko (Max Baer) and Paddy Considine (Braddock's pal: Mike Wilson), a Stephen Baldwin lookalike, who are spectacular in their supporting roles.Wrapped in the Great Depression, the riches to rags story held my rapt attention for each of its 150 min run time. Ron Howard's direction and the editing perfectly delivers the story of J J Braddock and family without losing me once. In today's vernacular, it's all good.Squeamish on boxing's impact on the human body? Look away. The film is too good to miss based on that alone.This film is in 'The Natural' (R Redford) class, with enough great one-liners that'll have devotees quoting them as they liberally do from the Godfather franchise. It's a magnificent rendering of Rocky, with the bonus of being true to boot. I loved it. 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,4 June 2005
