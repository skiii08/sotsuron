Walk the Line," johnny cash
","this movie is vary good on portraying johnny cash on his life, although they leave some parts of his life out, they still capture the kind of person 'the man in black was'. I myself am a huge johnny cash fan, and this film just brings it out the most. anyone who is thinking of going to go and See it , i advise it , unless Ur not a johnny cash fan ( people actually walked out of the movie , mind u they were under 16 and prolly didn't know who 'J.R.' was'. also the love between June and johnny cash was played out very well and reminds me and a friend of mine ( thats why i like this movie so much) all in all johnny cash was the man and still is and will live forever and anyone else who thinks the same should watch it as well. thank you",Null,0,1,3 January 2006
