Resident Evil: Afterlife," Another 3 year wait why? but in a good way
","This film is the best instalment to the trilogy, i went in with major high expectations for this films, it was that bad i was running away from people who have already seen the film before they could even breath a single word to me, also staying away from the reviews on here so i don't find anything out which was really frustrating.But in all fair play this film definitely delivered my taste to this amazing storyline, the writer/director is doing a fantastic job on keeping this films as close to the game as possible. Mean like resident evil 1 is based on 1 with Alice being involved which doesn't happen in the game but o well scratch that shall we, number two has a mix with number 2 and 3, extinction i felt went in its own path showing a different aspect to these sorta films being based all in daylight shooting which you rarely see in zombie films.Now this instalment to the films has its own way on playing but has sticked to the new resident evil 5 (my favourite in the series)besides being shot in south Africa. But keeping u with the new infected zombies and also adding the person behind everything with umbrella.I felt they chucked in a lot of off different aspects to this part, with it being shot in a costophobic way and also being shot in day and night. The action involved here as well was crystal nothing too over the top besides a bit too much slow-mo but hey we can all deal with that. More scarier and more jump scenes as well which i can come to terms no other resident evil has every chucked so many into.all in all i loved this chapter to this series.the only downside to me was the ending for one being as i was waiting through out the whole film see the return off Jill valentine and when i did i was like why why why. knowing i love the films i think it could off ended on this one because the director better do the 5 instalment and he has to really pull all the stops out to over do this one. Also the last thing is i felt it was a bit too long (longert then the last three i felt) but thats my only complaint.",10,15,33,11 September 2010
The Expendables," Bad Arse Cast For A Kick Arse Film
","Just got back from seeing this film and i was very mixed up what to expect by the reviews i have seen from it being to over hyped and it not delivering my expectations off the film.But this film has all the potential off an action film and raising the bar right off the stand, mean like what you expect from an action film is explosives, fight scenes, fit birds (obviously this film doesn't deliver that prospect but with the amount off blood, explosive scenes, fight scenes who needs a fit bird) The dialogue to this film is pretty much straight forward handed over a job go do it get it done roll on spending it back at home without a scratch. the film delivers a fair amount of one liners which i found really good timing and very funny (specially Sly and Arnold and Bruce's scene in the church)the film isn't too long or long winded at all.The characters where well suited to their roles none of them went too over the top on what they would not do in over films kept clean and simple and didn't just pull out all the stops for this blockbuster.The character i would say who stood out for me was Terry Cruz, even tho he wasn't much in the film he was good when he was on scene specially the ending in the tunnels sly showed a different aspect to actions films and still shows even tho they are older cast that they still know how to show the younger generation what its all about.My rating on this film i think is a fair play, its not the best film i seen but its certainly up there with ones i think are, its definitely a blockbuster hit and is sure to make any bad day turn into a good one =]",9,5,14,18 August 2010
Avengers: Endgame," What a way to end 11 years of build up
","Not done this in a while but here we go....I was shocked by how much I had enjoyed this film, especially from not really enjoying Avengers: Infinity War. I felt from the third entry, it let down the franchise a bit, but from the conclusion of the entire series wrapping the first Three Phrases it deserves 10/10.Without going into to much detail of the film and spoiling for others. This film had a very similar vibe from another superhero movie I have seen, but with similar context this film made it, it's own! Very well put together from the relationship of the characters, the humour and even the emotional moments. :)",10,0,3,25 April 2019

The Dark Knight Rises," Why do we fall?
","At last we have the conclusion of Christopher Nolan's take of the batman franchise.After two successful films from following the Bruce Wayne's origins on becoming the dark knight and taking on his most famous and psychotic villain the Joker, we are finally brought Bane 'The only villain to break the bat'. Now this film was an successful end to the trilogy that I am glad to say I was apart off during the beginning but that is not with out its flaws which I will get more into throughout my review.The Dark Knight Rises take place eight years after the death of Harvey dent in which Batman has been victimised in being a murderer to Gothams 'White knight'. Bruce Wayne has recluse himself from the outside struggling to cope with the death of his child hood sweetheart and have his own city betray the batman. Christian bale makes his final appearance as Bruce Wayne/Batman a performance of his career showing why we have taken such a point to why this batman series has been the most anticipated series yet and why Christian Bale has marked his place for this role.Michael Cain returns as Alfred and not having much on screen time as others, the time we do have with Alfred are very emotional as we have done in the past 2 batman films. We see such a passionate and dedicated man Alfred really is to keeping his promise to Bruce Wayne's parents that he will take care of him. Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman performances are more or less the same we have seen in the past two films if not less.Anne Hathaway plays as Cat woman who has had much criticism from the announcement that she will be playing cat woman. DO NOT let these criticisms fool you, She plays cat woman amazingly well and nails the performance perfectly. Tom Hardy's performance as bane I felt was a little let down (due to the mask) All we can see from Tom Hardy is that he is a well built person and makes the physical side of bane as what we know. As I said with the mask I felt let his performance down besides the expressions we see from him, vocally there was not much there and I felt they could of just got a well built person to play bane.Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays fellow Police office John Blake. Through the film I felt that there was going to be a twist with his character as we see him very interested in the batman and when we find out that he too was an orphan, alarm bells started to tick in my head but I will leave it as that. Other cast members who I have not gone through also did a very good job.For the final verdict on this conclusion of the dark knight. I felt not as much let down from the expectations of the film but I did not feel pleased as I did when I saw The Dark Knight. Now I do not know if this was the performance from the late Heath Ledger as the Joker who made us all believe he was mad and made his character his own. I am just hoping that this is the end of an amazing trilogy and a truly amazing experience. So I will be giving The Dark Knight Rises 4/5",8,1,3,20 July 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," Best horror film since when?
","Now when I was reading all the different reviews on this film I was expecting something that I have never seen any horror film do. (Well speaking about the surprise at the end thats about the best it gets throughout the entire film) Film is just any old typical teen horror films out there but with a twist of a battle royal feel but in a horror feeling. I have read that this film has been on the shelf for sometime since they released it. I feel that it should of gone straight to DVD to be honest. The dark comedy humour is the only savour this film has except for the bloody gore ending before the 'GODS' hand destroys earth.Mainly I was more interested when Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford was on screen. They played the best roles in my opinion they kept it sharp and funny when they where on screen with great chemistry. The film does follow the horror genre with the dumb blonde first to go to follow in sequence who goes next.Your typical stoner dude does some really great one liners when he is on screen, Specially when they are going through the basement and checking out all the different objects that will summon what will come for them.The killings I felt where very lack in imagination of what the Red Neck Zombies could have done. But when the film got to the ending and you saw all the other nightmares that they could of had, I was more like really Red Neck Zombies over the Werewolf, Ghost, Snake (Even tho it looked so terrible) and all the others.Even thought this film is really saved by the ending. I feel that the Â£10 I spent could of been saved for another film. This film is basically for a night in with your mates with a pizza and few beers where not much attention is needed.2/5 for my rate",4,10,22,22 April 2012
