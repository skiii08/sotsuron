Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Re: agaluro-2's comment about Jesus
","In Phantom Menace, Anakin's mother says he was born w/o a father. I can't remember exactly what they said (I only saw it once, not my best movie going experience.)It does resemble the immaculate conception of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, but Anakin is Darth Vader, am I right?  Darth Vader is on the Dark side, right? Darth Vader use the 'force' to hurt others, right? Hmm, I don't remember any of that in my daily bible studies. So, according to the movie, and viewers making the same assumption as aga. somethings gonna happen in episodes 2 and 3 that's gonna make Jesus become part of the evil dark side. So, Jesus will turn away from us sometime in the future. Ouch. If Jesus was gonna turn away from us, why would he have sacrifieced himself? Maybe I'm getting a little carried away but I think Lucas did so as well, writing that plot in. Agaluro, I wasn't trying to knock you- your comment just struck a nerve I feel that many will see that spot the same way you did, and it hurts being a believer of Jesus.",5,0,1,2 June 1999
