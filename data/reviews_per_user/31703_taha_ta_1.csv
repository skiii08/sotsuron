It," what the fruit did I just see?
","**This review might contain a little spoiler**This movie has been a complete waste of time, money and effort. I don't know where to begin! possibly with the story that didn't even exist? first ten minutes or so were OK, catchy and cool, but then the what was supposed to be a badass clown was hiding in the sewage with all that CG it just made zero sense, this was supposed to be in the fifties! as far as I know no CG back then. and hey where were the parents at? kids going missing left and right and seemingly nobody cared, no police no demonstrations no nothing. 20 + little kids running around at noon time. it's not what I signed up for. here is a tip: go spend that money on Pizza, at least you will sleep the night happy and full. I would have given 0 if that was a possibility. cheers yo!",1,3,6,23 October 2017
