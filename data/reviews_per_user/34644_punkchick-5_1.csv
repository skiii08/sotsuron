Marie Antoinette," Worst movie ever
",Marie Antoinette is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life.It was so boring. I almost fell asleep. I hated it.I would not recommend anyone to watch this movie.It is stupid.It stinks and i never want to see it again.The movie was so slow. It didn't really have a plot.Nothing happened throughout the whole movie.They didn't explain things properly. Then in some parts they dragged it on and on.I feel as if i have been cheated of 123 minutes of my life and i will never get it back.I feel angry at the fact that i sat their and watched this useless movie and it was so horrible.This has got to be the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life and thats something.,1,10,18,6 October 2007
