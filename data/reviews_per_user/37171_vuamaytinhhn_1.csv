The Avengers," Avengers: Infinity War
","Easy to understand, Avengers: Infinity War as a new X X oven. People only pay attention to the ostentatious, luxurious, expensive and commemorative aspects of it that forget the inherent weaknesses. And this is just a tool to pull the purse of the audience to the following products to 'revive' what it 'death'.To make it easy to understand, the Marvel blockbuster is just a movie with a 'watch for fun' factor when a series of superheroes die will be resurrected and the event is considered as never happened (If this time You do not know the Avengers 4 is the sequel and revolve around the time to revive the Avengers members, the error you do not read the newspaper only!).Instead of bringing a big battle like what the trailer promotes, the work is a long, patchy story that lasts more than two hours. The Russo brothers decided to split the superhero into a series of small groups that made the plot fragment and destroy all previous products.Why? Not just last year, Marvel spent 130 minutes and $ 180 million for Thor: Ragnarok so that Thunder (Chris Hemsworth) can control the power without hammer? Odin (Anthony Hopkins) also asked a sarcastic comment: 'Are you Thor Boy or Thor Thunder?' that? Thor then spent more than half the amount of time in the Avengers: Infinity War just to find the new hammer and never use lightning once. And Groot (Vin Diesel) hugged the phone boringly throughout the movie just to make a hammer for the audience to shout and forget that the storyline (or even this character) is no problem. nothing.",9,0,1,17 July 2018
