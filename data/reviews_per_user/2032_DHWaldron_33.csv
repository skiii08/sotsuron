Blade Runner 2049," Every scene: Important; Extravagant; Pure Perfection
","A classic in the science-fiction genre, 'Blade Runner 2049' is a slow, mastered piece of film, directed by Denis Villeneuve (debuted in the sci-fi genre with the masterpiece, 'Arrival'). This film is a true masterpiece of cinema and , greater than the original, but not a masterpiece such as 2001 (which attacks concepts and beliefs), whereas 'Blade Runner 2049' succeeds not only driving the plot, but speeds down the highway, amazing onlookers. Although the film may seem slow based on the trailer, it allows for character development on a whole new scale with twists and turns which will shock you beyond belief! Ryan Gosling ('La La Land', 'Drive') stars as K, the new blade runner, replacing Harrison Ford's role as the original blade runner. Ryan Gosling provides a spectacular performance, draws upon all of his acting skills in order to deliver this blank, emotionless protagonist which is necessary for this role. But to oppose K is a violent emotionless replicant, although, personally, this latest addition is not as lovable as Rutger Hauer, but makes a fantastic villain for battle.The film, although visually slow-paced, is mentally thrilling, with an absolutely brilliant soundtrack, composed by Hans Zimmer (Dunkirk; Interstellar; etc) juxtaposed with some of the most beautiful cinematography of this year. Easily one of the greatest films of the year, 'Blade Runner 2049' is not only a fantastic film, but one of the greatest sequels ever produced.",10,9,19,13 October 2017
Angels & Demons," Luck-Lustre and completely unbelievable
","'Angels & Demons' is the first sequel to 'The DaVinci Code', with Tom Hanks (playing Robert Langdon) being the only returning cast member. Once again, the film deals with conspiracies surrounding the Pope. This time, it's the Pope, the Illuminati and the Vatican in general. The movie, although filled with a great cast, is luck-lustre and features unbelievable action sequences and somewhat twisted motives. The feeling surrounding this film is not great, and fails as a predecessor to the fantastic conspiracy in 'The DaVinci Code'. Overall 'Angels & Demons', overall, was not as interesting as 'The DaVinci Code', and only passes as an OKAY film.",5,0,1,10 October 2017
Alien 3," Take the TRI out of TRIQUEL, and replace it with a SE. A film to be FORGOTTEN!
","The first 2 'Alien' films were polar opposites, the first being a slow-paced horror, the second being a fast-paced apocalyptic action film. Due to the sudden change of pace and genre, viewers were surprised and excited by this spectacle. This seems to be attempted in 'Alien 3', with a tougher Ripley, a new setting and enough gore and violence to satisfy any maniacal knife-slicing lover. Unfortunately, this attempt fails to improve the franchise, with few good factors towards its name. With Ripley surrounded by an all male cast, we can already predict what is eventually going to happen, but it manages to get worse from there. An unprecedented amount of violence, not ALL made by the Xenomorph, but a cut-throat lunatic, and gore do not help this movie's ranking rise. With a foolish plot, annoying characters and dialogue, and the most ridiculous of Xenomorph designs, 'Alien 3' is definitely a film to be forgotten.",3,1,5,15 August 2017
It," The FRIGHT-FACTOR wears off
","Pennywise the Dancing Clown has traumatized children (... and adults) across the world in many generations. Pennywise attacks the town of Derry, Maine, every 27 years or so; and now, in 2017, a new 'It' has been made, 27 years from the original mini-series starring Tim Curry. The original mini-series was acclaimed for its first hour-and-a-half episode. Most loved the kids, but hated the ending of the second part. This has shadowed the horror of 'It' for 27 years, and this new remake means to change that.The acting, by all of the actors/actresses, is incredible, with a strong sense of camaraderie between the seven children, but their full potential has not been grasped. With too few scenes of these children and their bonding, you fail to be connected to many of them. These scenes, instead, are filled with Pennywise haunting and tormenting the children. There are many of these scenes, and the clown is seen so often that he begins to lose his fright-factor. You jump at the jump scares, but are not scared much thereafter. The violence and gore is not that bad; there is mainly just blood. The use of blood, in one scene in the bathroom, is far too excessive and overused.But overall, the movie is quite good, with the kids supporting the entire film.",7,3,10,9 September 2017
Akira," Down-right SPECTACULAR!
","'Akira' is set after a bomb strikes Tokyo, sending it into a post-apocalyptic state, where psychics exist and teenage bikies flood the streets. After a violent and graphic opening sequence, one of Kaneda's (the protagonist of the film) friends are kidnapped. Throughout the film, we witness the development of the antagonist, Kaneda's friend, Tetsuo. Tetsuo develops psychic powers for an unknown reason, he soon becomes obsessed with the power, which cloud reason and judgement. All through the film we witness a complicated and unique plot-line and character developments which are interesting and not-your-usual-style. For example, Kaneda, the protagonist, does have qualities which frustrate and repel the viewer, but his heroic and redeeming qualities make him a stand-out character. The underlying and complicated plot add to the reasons of why this film is a must-watch.The only disappointing aspect was the (sometimes) extreme and unnecessary level of violence. But, the overall plot, character development and spectacular animation (even for the current day) prove this film to be an unmissable classic.",9,0,4,14 August 2017
Alien: Resurrection," For once the Alien has a motive... and maybe even our sympathies
","Alien Resurrection is clouded by the premise of THE WORST ALIEN MOVIE EVER! although, it is not superb, fantastic, and only manages to skim through the OKAY class, it was watchable and, at parts enjoyable and nuanced. In Alien 3 Ripley killed herself after discovering the Alien Queen was nested within her abdomen. Following on from that film, Alien Resurrection begins with scientists cloning Ripley, removing the Queen from her chest, and producing Xenomorphs in a laboratory. The Xenomorphs escape, and Ripley and a team of friends must find a way to destroy the spacecraft and save themselves before the craft reaches its home base: Earth. Starring Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley (and the only returning cast member) and Winona Ryder as Call, the film is home to the new, highly critiqued Xenomorph design: the Newborn, a strange unshelled , disfigured Xenomorph. Despite all the pessimistic views surrounding this fourth installation, the film was pleasantly surprising, greatly surpassing the likes of Alien 3. Weaver's character begins as a mentally unstable human (or clone in this instance) and although she is an interesting and weird character, all the others are one-dimensional with unmotivated acts (such as a guy who shoots a spider with a gun...), as well as these mood-swings some of the characters occasionally suffer from. Viewing the shorter, Theatrical Version of the film, not the Special Edition, was a shorter yet, I believe, the correct decision. Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the director of the film, was happy with the Theatrical Version, although the writer, Joss Whedon (creator of the hit TV Series Buffy the Vampire Slayer) believes that this film is the worst installation in the Alien franchise. Personally, I found it exploring a different, uncultivated avenue for the franchise, at one point, engaging the audience to pity the Xenomorph. Although this pity is felt, it is not supported by the costumes and effects of the Xenomorph and its new hybrid, the Newborn, revealing, for the first time, the eyes of the Xenomorph. The Newborn is a nuanced and interesting character in this movie. Like the third movie, this film does not manage to derive itself of the unnesseccary violence and swearing, featuring a disturbing sexual scene; not because it is revealing or unconsented, but because the whole premise is disturbing in itself. Whether this deeply wounds or heals the film is decided upon the viewer, but it does lead to strange, confusing matters, which are completely different to the other aspects visible in this franchise.",5,0,1,24 January 2018
The Others," A redefinition of the horror genre
","After starring in Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut, Nicole Kidman, she now stars in The Others, your not-so run of the mill, haunted house, ghost feature, engraving its name on the tombstone of best horror films of the 21st century so far. Nicole Kidman gives an absolutely spectacular performance as Grace Stewart, the mother of two photosensitive children and the owner of an enormous manor/mansion. Christopher Eccleston provides a crucial, yet minuscule, role which is integral to the comprehension of this complicated and twisting plot which literally flips 180 degrees on itself. Rarely seen in 21st century horror films, is the dramatic build-up of suspense, frightening audiences with a simple creak of a door or rustle of a curtain. Every scene is tense with very little comic relief; you could count the number of humorous lines (or jokes) on one hand. The Other is an extremely intense film which manages to capture this sensation for every second of these 104 minutes.",8,0,0,28 October 2017
Thor: Ragnarok," Monstrous development of both characters and industry
","Taika Waititi was assigned to the role of director for the new Thor film following the success of his comedy Hunt for the Wilderpeople. Thor continues from the success of the previous Avengers films as well as the previous two Thor films, obvious from the various references present, but not completely necessary in the enjoyment-factor. Waititi, given the reins of one of the most anticipated films of the year, declared that, he would add comedy in this new installation, with Waititi himself voicing the funniest character of the film, Korg, a stone-skinned humanoid. Waititi's vision was brought to fruition through the triplet of writer's who successfully employed a range of comedy rarely endeavoured in superhero films.Starring in the satisfying, unconvoluted plot, is Chris Hemsworth continuing his role of Thor accompanied by a new makeover and a monstrous power. With a guest appearance from Mark Ruffalo, continuing as Hulk, the film had everything going for it; it was promising. This regularly comedic script was, despite it's strengths, boring and sluggish for the first quarter, but revives itself quickly, and in parts, completely captures one's interest. With great acting from Chris Hemsworth, the Hulk felt overused in (a particular section of) the film and, in some Bruce Banner rather than Hulk sections, Mark Ruffalo's performance was not up to scratch. The films also possessed annoying and clichÃ© 'tough-girls' in Tessa Thompson's 'Valkyrie' and Cate Blanchett's 'Hela', the antagonist of the film.The script also undertakes extravagant, exaggerated battle sequences which, most of the time, aren't interesting (basically, any without Thor - bias?). But, Korg (the comedic rock-man) helps to lift the film as does the highly satisfying final battle and Thor's monstrous development.",6,0,3,8 December 2017
The Terminator," An over-rated, dated film
","Directed by the phenomenal and successful director James Cameron (who also directed classic films such as 'Aliens', 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day', 'Titanic' and 'Avatar') 'The Terminator' is James Cameron's first major success as a film, and he has, ever since, periodically released box-office royalty one after the other. The film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger (who also stars in Predator) who plays the terminator, Michael Biehn (who stars in both Aliens and The Abyss) who plays Kyle Reese, and Linda Hamilton playing Sarah Connor. First look; a great cast, but unfortunately, some overacting by the supporting cast can become annoying, though it be brief. The film has a unique and brutal antagonist but fails to become truly interesting and just seems to drag despite the short film time of 107 minutes. As well as the dated special effects, the film manages to become partly epic in its second half.",6,3,8,7 November 2017
Ready Player One," Enjoyable with great CGI
","Steven Spielberg has released yet another blockbuster, Ready Player One, only a year after the Oscar-Nominated The Post. Despite the disappointing, almost repelling trailer, Ready Player One is an enjoyable, entertaining blockbuster filled with amazing action sequences, but lowly nuanced characters. The film plays on the nostalgia of the 80s generation (many Easter Eggs; Alien, Back to the Future, Akira, etc.) much like the E.T. inspired Stranger Things adding that blockbuster, superhero-virtual-reality twist to draw the younger generations. Basically, it's a film that can be enjoyed by anyone. The film is also successful in not resorting to a classic Hollywood move: recruiting pretty and handsome teenagers to fill the role, which is refreshing and pleasing to see in this generation of film. The film strays from recruiting a line-up of an all-star cast, with great performances from the leading actors. The 'star' actors amount to only two or three: Ben Mendelsohn (who is abruptly and quickly established as the antagonist), Mark Rylance (who previously starred in Spielberg classic Bridge of Spies) and Simon Pegg. The acting is overall, pretty good, but, due to some underdeveloped (sometimes poorly developed) and stereotypical characters, the ledge to fantastic is too steep for the film to climb. The film manages to retain a level of intrigue (despite glaring similarities to The Matrix) with an incredible realism surrounding animated and CGI features, which is basically three-quarters of the film. A great follow-up to the near-classic The Post, Spielberg completely switches genres and target audiences to create another great production",8,0,3,6 April 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," A teenage Peter Parker (Spider-man) is trying to find his way into The Avengers (a group of superheroes) and his way in the superhero world.
","With a new 'Spider-man' (actor), as well as basically a whole new cast (apart from Iron Man cameos) I saw the new trailer for 'Spider-man: Homecoming' and thought (despite being a fan of them): 'How are they going to drag it out now?' Seems I was wrong. After years of 'Spider-man' film adaptations, the origins have been redone by Andrew Garfield (2012) after they were adapted by Tobey Maguire, ten years earlier, with many of the memorable and interesting villains already being adapted. That's why I was glad to see no more origins. 'Spider-man: Homecoming' is about Peter Parker trying to pair his social and superhero life together in the peak of adolescence. Meanwhile, Spider-man, his alter-ego/superhero identity, is trying to find his 'big break' in the superhero world, competing against a range of factors (e.g. school, love-life, age, etc).This film is the 'in-between' of all the previous movies, with a fantastic and well-driven plot-line, and many comedic touches which lighten up the atmosphere. As well as numerous plot-twists, this 'Spider-man' movie can only be topped by the epic action and battle sequences in which it follows.",8,1,6,11 August 2017
Justice League," Well above expectations
","Super-hero film crossovers have flourished since the first 'Avengers' film, combining the universes of the most popular comic-book heroes known (like Hulk and Iron Man). 'Justice League' has imitated this with, virtually, the same storyline (saying that, they're all virtually the same) where the world is powerless to this seemingly invincible alien invasion, only to hopefully be saved for those few gifted individuals...except for Batman, who is just rich. Written by Chris Terrio (writer of 'Argo') and Joss Whedon (who co-wrote 'The Avengers') have produced a mediocre, recognisable script (alien invasion and what not) but, unlike 'The Avengers', this film didn't have the superheroes or acting talent needed to create something of that quality despite the characters' potential. The Flash is an interesting hero, having the power of super-speed, produced by DC, but his character comes across as almost unnecessary and powerless some of the time. Not only that, Cyborg's CGI-ed body is poorly executed in scenes, Aquaman is obnoxious (which, paired with cringe-dialogue, gets tiresome), and Batman is the weakest of the lot, when he should be (not necessarily the strongest, physically) not having to reuse the enemies weapons. That's just low and sad, especially for Batman. Even worse for the film's reputation is what it must resort to to stop an powerful alien who just wants to destroy the universe. DC has the heroes capable of standing up to the likes of Marvel, and, despite the lacking optimism of the 2011 film adaptation, Green Lantern would have made a great contribution to the film. But, this predictable, mediocre story makes the five heroes seem utterly hopeless, save Wonder Woman, who is the the only one who actually manages to show a little power, just watch the way The Flash runs, but, saying that, it is still entertaining and watchable.",6,0,0,21 December 2017
The Matrix Revolutions," The only aspect of this film worth seeing the poster
","Even The Matrix franchise is not immune to the curse of the trilogies; a curse spanning generations involving the triumphant success of a first film followed by waning enjoyment until a dull and dreary finale. The Dark Knight, The Hobbit, and rumourdly The Godfather, all succumbed to a similar result. Following the cliffhanger of Reloaded, Revolutions fails to deliver what its successors could; namely: a decent plot. With a dull and boring script, this film drags from within the half-hour with minor appearances from the stars (i.e. Keanu Reeves and Hugo Weaving) leaving yourself to question why this film was made in the first place. Dramatic overacting on the part of minor-characters during overused gun sequences shifts the tone of this movie in a similar direction as Predator rather than the scintillating science-fiction narrative of The Matrix. Never mind the acting, the terrible choreography and extended action-scenes are over-dramatic, with each seeming like an experimental director trying to outdo the complexity of the first two films. With each dragging fight, you are left thinking to yourself: 'When is this going to end?'. The answer is never. The scars left by this movie leave senses of regret for two wasted hours, and moments that should conjure emotions of sadness or happiness, just conjure a feeling of relief that The Wachowski Brothers finally sparred us the torment of yet another cringy line. The film tries to be philosophical and 'clever' when it is in fact just seeming to use lines you find inside a fortune cookie. It is annoying and frustrating to see a seriously good franchise ruined by the greed to secure more profit for the company.",2,2,3,11 October 2018
Bridge of Spies," An amazingly engaging historical representation
","Bridge of Spies stars Tom Hanks as the real-life lawyer James B. Donovan, who must defend the captured Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). Directed and produced by Steven Spielberg, who has directed and produced many war-time films (such as Saving Private Ryan, War Horse and Schindler's List) he sets this film during the bleak conditions of the Cold War, just as the Berlin War completes construction.Bridge of Spies employs fantastic acting from all cast members, especially Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance, who emit a strong yet realistic sense of camaraderie and friendship due to their, at first, mutual relationship which develops into a bond so tight that the audience doesn't want it to be broken. The film also manages to contrast image and words, which work brilliantly, such as every scene where Tom Hanks is on a train, where no words are spoken, but one hundred ideas are broadcasted via the strong emotional face of Tom Hanks. These Grade-A performances as well as the completely differing settings of the two halves of the film, perfectly execute the mood integral for this serious, often heart-tugging moments. As mentioned, the scenery is gorgeous, with frequent switches of location; from America to Berlin and back, the location/cinematography greatly enhances the atmosphere of this film as do the uncoverings of background characters emotions and feelings towards Hanks' character such as a random policeman he meets, all questioning him: 'Why are you defending that traitor?', revealing to the audience the side some must take for their country.Overall, the film is magnificent with perfect performances, a contrasting climate (from sun to snow) and the nuanced characters makes Bridge of Spies a fantastic film with strong underlying morals and values which still apply to this day.",9,1,2,11 November 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man," A new Spider-man SLINGING in for 'The Amazing Spiderman'
","Approximately 5 years since the making of the third and final Tobey Maguire 'Spider-man' film, Andrew Garfield is the next actor to hit the stage, with a new story, villain, and lover.After a school excursion, Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider, giving him superpowers similar to those of a spider (including amazing instincts, super strength and the ability to climb up walls). After receiving this power, he attempts to use it to his advantage, but after the death of a close relative, he undergoes a period where he seeks vengeance, before progressing to a goal to protect others.Easily the best 'Spider-man' film since 2002, the first of the Tobey Maguire legacy, the film features an amazing line-up of actors with Andrew Garfield playing Spider-man/Peter Parker and Emma Stone playing Gwen Stacy, Peter Parker's love interest. The two perform spectacularly together, with an obvious attraction between both actors and characters. The CGI for The Lizard (Rhys Ifan - the antagonist of the film) is also extremely well done, making him seem all the more realistic. The return of 'Spider-man' is definitely not to be missed.",10,2,4,12 August 2017
Alien vs. Predator," No wonder it was in the discount bin...
","Could the crossover of the 'Alien' and the 'Predator' franchises be stopped? Probably not; it was going to happen sooner or later, as was hinted in 'Predator 2'. The question is whether it 'should' have been stopped. The expectations for this movie were, frankly speaking, low. No intricate plot is expected, just a full-on action battle between two of the most world-renowned and iconic alien designs ever produced. Which is all we get; even a little plot development. A group put together by Charles Bishop Weyland (played by Lance Henriksen) must investigate an unknown pyramid underneath Antarctica. Firstly, if you have watched 'Alien 3', which is set in the future, where a younger version of the same character (Charles BIshop Weyland) is present, just ignore the incontinuity, because there are plenty more. Such as the completely improbable costumes; for example, no beanies are worn (and the cast is plunged into the surface of Antarctica) and a single singlet for a top layer of clothing for one scene.
Despite all of the flaws, there are scenes of suspense which can get you slightly anxious, but there is no connection to the characters; nothing for you to want them to survive (save for Ewen Bremmer, who plays Graeme Miller, father of two kids). Most of the characters you begin to discover and connect with, die within the next ten minutes (don't worry, that's not a spoiler)! 
As usual with these types of movies, there must always be the tough guy/girl who happens to hate the world for reasons unexplained, unfortunately, paired with a fine piece of overacting, the character just becomes worse and negatively affects the film. Another piece of nonsensical rubbish is located when, suddenly, these expeditioners pull out machine guns out of these huge cases... why would anybody have a gun? This pyramid is meant to originate from ancient civilisations, I imagine most of the people would be long dead! You can count the number of people who don't have a gun on one hand... (they must be the people who don't have foresight). As mentioned, there are some good scenes (like the costumes and occasionally CGI of the alien/xenomorph) which, are mostly (if only) the Predator vs. Alien scenes. There is some effective CGI which is present, but there are also poor, uneffective scenes, but nothing to take away any enjoyment. 
The film is watchable, but doesn't seem to affect the 'Alien' or 'Predator' universes (so far), so, unless you are eager enough to see this instalment, there are much better horror and action movies out there, just look a bit harder.",4,1,3,18 January 2018
Batman Begins," Visually compelling!
","Eight years after the apparent flop of 'Batman and Robin', the Batman franchise have been begging for a new adaptation, with a new and improved origin. This has been successfully accomplished in 'Batman Begins'. The movie begins. A new Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale), a new Batman, a new origin story. The film is very interesting and extremely compels the viewers with an engaging story-line complimented by wonderful performances from the entire cast (although the whole, Batman-has-a-deep-and-rough-voice thing can become tedious) makes this not just a great superhero movie, but a great movie in general; even for those who have (somehow) never heard of Batman. Christian Bale is great as Bruce Wayne/Batman, giving a realistic depiction of how Bruce Wayne would actually act. The antagonists are believable, with clear and developed motives, making the film impossible NOT to understand! The sets are exceptional with amazing cinematography, which also highly compliment the plot. A must-see as a film, and an exceptional superhero film.",9,0,0,11 October 2017
Man on the Moon," The film encapsulates comedic purity
","'The Man on the Moon' stars Jim Carrey, as the highly debated comedian Andy Kaufman, as well as Danny DeVito, who plays Andy Kaufman's manager, George Shapiro. Jim Carrey has starred in 'Dumb and Dumber' as well as the masterpiece 'The Truman Show', yet has managed to produce one of the his best performances to date thanks to a hilarious, interesting film directed by Milos Forman, who also directed 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'.Based on a true story, the film follows the life of an eccentric American comedian Andy Kaufman, and his practical, crude jokes which he employs to 'entertain' his audience. Jim Carrey is brilliant in his role as Andy Kaufman, capturing pure comedic essence in his performance and precisely, if not perfectly, mimicking Kaufman's original movements and gestures. With a brilliant performance, all that remained was a brilliant script; which was delivered. The script is constantly hilarious but despite a small lag in the middle section and an abrupt ending, the script is fabulously pieced with twists available and lovable characters- 'You're insane, but you might also be brilliant'.",8,0,0,7 November 2017
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," The RISE of a new era.
","After an outbreak of Simian Flu, a virus activated after humans experimented on apes, Caesar (Andy Serkis), a house-raised ape, inherits extraordinary mental power, propelling him to new heights which seem to be capable of reaching humans'. 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' is an emotional and dramatic prequel to the original 'Planet of the Apes' (1968). The performance made by Andy Serkis lifts the movie, and although his face cannot be seen, his emotions can be read.",10,1,3,12 August 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A no hope
","After viewing a dramatic, highly anticipated trailer, The Last Jedi proved as a disappointing, lack-lustre film, not capturing the essence necessary to raise the this film to even a 'good'-level like many of the films have soared past. The Last Jedi has mainly a full returning cast, following the basic premise of most Star Wars films: The-Bad-Guys-are-shooting-us-,-what-are-we-going-to-do? sort of thing. Adam Driver performs well as the returning villain, Kylo Ren, accompanied by an emotional performance from Mark Hamill, easily the best actor in the film. New to the stage are the new species of space-penguins, the funny, adorable Porgs, who are like a sidekick for Chewie (who surprisingly wasn't in the film that much) and are a great comedic element for the otherwise boring film. Mark Hamill, as mentioned, performs incredibly well, along with Adam Driver, but the script and plot are just not interesting. The lack-lustre lead-up to the announcement of Rey's parents, elongated, unnecessary final battle, and the cringy, cheesy one-liners just to begin with. The Last Jedi just feels like of those films that just does not end! It is extremely dragged out and, at times, can be quite frustrating. The most exciting elements was a cameo from Frank Oz and releasing Andy Serkis (who plays Supreme Leader Snoke) was in the film!Maybe expectations were too high for this highly anticipated film. Don't go with high hopes, this is easily the weakest of this new generation of Star Wars films.",5,1,2,17 December 2017
The Dark Knight," Beautiful! Compelling! Perfect!
","One of the greatest DC superhero films ever produced if not THE greatest, 'The Dark Knight' is the sequel to Batman Begins with many returning cast members, such as, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman, with a new yet utterly recognisable villain entering the stage; Heath Ledger playing the Joker, giving an absolutely amazing performance as a crazed psychopath. Moral issues are tackled with great cinematography and beautifully performed parts. If an issue was to be addressed, it would be Christian Bale's voice as Batman. Although it can be overlooked due to the minor issue it plays in such a big picture, it is frustrating to hear his deep and croaky voice. Take a Strepsil! 'The Dark Knight' somehow surpasses 'Batman Begins' and there is next-to-nothing to flaw this film with an exceptional performance from Heath Ledger, making him the most incredible villain to date.",10,0,0,11 October 2017
2001: A Space Odyssey," One of the greatest films to date
","Questioning the viewers' beliefs and offering trippy yet insanely interesting sequences, makes this film not only one of the greatest science-fiction films of all time, but one of the greatest films of all time! The mysterious aura emitted by this film is breath-taking, as are the cinematography and overall concept. The films begins slowly, but due to an stunningly intelligent climax in this scene, providing a clear answer to the question everybody asks at least once in their life: 'How did man develop the mentality to kill?' Soon after, the mysterious elements are in play, and the eerie soundtrack provides suspense in a way only a small proportion of films have utilised. The film is incredible, challenge after challenge of human history and future as well as an inexplicable bigger picture.As mysterious elements continue to be placed into play, we witness the introduction of the most memorable robot of all time: HAL; who is interesting and is a vital character in a vital arc of a film. He provides the some of the stepping stones for the resolution of this inexplicable film. Once more, the cinematography is fabulous and is an absolutely masterpiece, best appreciated with a clear head and lots of concentration.",10,3,4,11 October 2017
Avatar," Incredible and stunning!
","Directed by the world-renowned James Cameron, after the major success of 'Alien', and 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day', James Cameron has once more made an engaging science-fiction film, tackling issues of racism and conserving the rainforest/environment. The film is centered around Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) who plays the role of a paraplegic ex-marine, betraying and manipulating an alien species for human purposes. The film has spectacular visual effects, capable of standing-up to those of today; but, being pedantic, CGI is apparent during some scenes involving giant robots, which only slightly add to a dated feel. Despite this, interesting and developed characters with clear motives push the film along. The extent the Na'vi (the alien species situated on Pandora) are explored both emotionally and (especially) culturally propel the film to a new level, supported by an incredible setting, with apparent contrast of the industrialised human world to the vast landscape and jungles of Pandora. The hidden messages of equality and save-the-rainforest are subtly noticeable and add to the film.Performances were good, but, unlike some films, the environment and messages were the film, not the star line-up (including Sigourney Weaver). 'Avatar' is a truly interesting film, and a stepping-stone for not only science-fiction but motion capture films in the future.",8,0,0,10 October 2017
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Not great; not terrible; 'Home Alone 2' is an OKAY film
","Unlike the original 'Home Alone', the situation has developed, spending longer times on the slapstick comedy of the Wet Bandits, depriving the film of its original comfort; the location. Relocating the setting to New York is an act of deprivation of the cosiness of the original. Once more, Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) is cute yet a smart-aleck kid with an attitude that could challenge even the crudest of adults. He once more gets into mischief, somehow getting separated yet again from his family. Not only that, but 'Home Alone 2' has basically the same first 10 minutes as the original, which is frustrating to re-watch. Eventually, we learn of the escape of the Wet Bandits, which has excruciatingly painful scenes for any person, let alone child. The acting is fine, with the best scenes of the film including Tim Curry as a hotel concierge, which, by the way, do not involve the bandits.With this sequel, the film has resorted to cheesy lines, exaggerated violence and repetition, as most film franchises eventually succumb to.",5,0,2,12 October 2017
Jack Reacher," Jack Reacher; a gritty, hard-core protagonist
","Jack Reacher stars Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher and is directed by Christopher McQuarrie, who has written Edge of Tomorrow as well as the highly acclaimed The Usual Suspects. The film follows a shooting in which Jack Reacher must discover the real culprit of the crime. The film begins with your usual clichè young, handsome shooter who wears dark sunglasses. This clichè approach to gangsters and mafia and shooters are old and frankly worn. That being said, this is the only overly cliché film which doesn't particularly have much impact on the overall film apart from the antagonist who's a German, ate off his fingers and has scars all over his face and body. The action and uncovering of information that Tom Cruise and Rosamund Pike (who plays Helen) undertake is incredibly interesting but is contrasted with high-paced action and battle scenes, with a spectacular finalé battle, which is done extremely well. But most importantly is the resolve Reacher holds. It is what we want from all our action heroes: just shoot the bad guy and quit with the small talk finally.The film has a great atmosphere (particularly in this final battle scene) which creates a dark and gritty feel. The film itself, is too long, though, with the film seeming to drag through some sections, with Tom Cruise being the only one to give an above average performance, whereas others overact or just don't give a great performance.",7,0,0,11 November 2017
Edge of Tomorrow," A good science-fiction, action film, but there are many better
","'Edge of Tomorrow', starring Tom Cruise (Cage) and Emily Blunt (Rita), is a mind-bending science-fiction, action film, which was, surprisingly, quite good. After reading the manga adaptation of 'All You Need Is Kill' (which was renamed 'Edge of Tomorrow'), I was interested to see what the film adaptation was like, with low hopes, due to how most manga adaptations turn out. Saying that, 'Edge of Tomorrow' was high above my expectations, with a great performance from Tom Cruise.Unfortunately, the film begins with some, frankly, cliché, stereotypical, dialogue, which is, thankfully, only used at the beginning but later returns. The film, from there, is great, with a 4/5 first half melding action and science-fiction beautifully. But, the film once more resorted to the use of high-paced action scenes, in the second half, with cuts left right and centre, completely disregarding its science-fiction origins for a small portion of this half; a mistake being the switch of location constantly occurring. The characters are unlikeable (excluding Cage), which is a downside, because they are either stereotypical soldiers speaking cliché dialogue, or an ex-alpha-alien killing woman constantly performing sensual push-ups due to the power Cage possesses. The film tries too hard to create a non-existent rapport with Luke and Rita, which seems stagnant, and should be mellifluous and free-flowing and this halts the progression of the actual story.",6,0,0,28 October 2017
Murder on the Orient Express," A surprising success
","The film 'Murder on the Orient Express' has been remade many times; the same story; the same setting; the same suspects, and this new installation in the 'remakes' of this film features an amazing lineup of cast members including Judi Dench, Kenneth Branagh and Johnny Depp. The film was directed by Kenneth Branagh himself, who also stars as the world-renowned detective Hercule Poirot, and was written by Michael Green who released three majorly successful films this year alone, in 'Blade Runner: 2049', 'Logan', and 'Alien Covenant'.The film follows 'the best detective in the world', Hercule Poirot, who must solve a sudden murder on the famous train, the orient express, with a wide range of suspects, motives and means. Kenneth Branagh gives his performance of Hercule Poirot, an intelligent (seemingly) OCD detective who separates right from wrong and serves justice to those via his deductive reasoning and 'little grey cells', which is fantastic despite the shrub growing off his face (which eventually passes as unnoticeable). In fact, 'The Murder on the Orient Express' emits spectacular performances from all cast members, who all manage to extract perfectly dramatic and interesting performances at appropriate times - particularly Josh Gad, who also starred as Olaf in 'Frozen', who gave a great performance as Hector MacQueen. The script employs few physical action scenes, some of which are poorly choreographed or illogical, but supplies ample psychological action which is dramatic, bold and exciting. Set in a winter wonderland, the atmosphere is sufficient for this perfect crime which will entangle minds, including the great Hercule Poirot himself. The film is a great Agatha Christie adaptation which will suit audiences of all ages and preferences, and will not disappoint, despite trailer expectations.",7,7,20,11 November 2017
Prometheus," Philosophical and Unique
","Despite angered viewers and reviewers, 'Prometheus' is unique to the 'Alien' franchise, being the first movie to not actually show a Xenomorph until the final moments. Despite all of the negative feedback the film has received, it is easily one of the top movies of the franchise. 'Prometheus', unlike the other films, is not about the survival against the alien, but about survival against age and time, as a weary old man withers, and searches for the creation of humans to plead with them to extend his life, or better still, gift him immortality.The prequel to 'Alien' is filled with nods which will excite fans, but still seem relevant to the new viewer. The acting is good, but, as usual, the visual effects and make-up overshadow them all, with particularly exceptional make-up for 'The Engineer' (a late antagonist), contrasted with a detailed set. The only issue with the film were some continuity errors (which may possibly be explained in later sequels). Unfortunately though, the dissatisfied fans and lack of horror elements means that this film won't be remembered for its underlying intricate philosophical teachings and story line.",8,3,5,12 August 2017
The Dark Knight Rises," Disappointing, but not a bad film
","The Dark Knight Rises once more stars Christian Bale as Batman, in the third movie of this trilogy, and Tom Hardy as Bane, Batman's main nemesis in this film. After turmoil and trouble struck both Bruce Wayne and Batman at the end of The Dark Knight, Bruce Wayne has, like most superhero franchises, hung up the mask of the Dark Knight, now a cripple who resorts to using a cane and is bested by simple cat burglars. Being a new low for Batman, it is even worse that Wayne Enterprises is slowly becoming broke. A new low for Batman; a new low for Wayne. Even worse, a new nemesis, Bane, enters the fray, trained in a similar style to Wayne, Bane promises strength (without his signature venom to power him on; as may be familiar in the comics or cartoons) which can somehow allow him to punch through concrete, and a completely exaggerated motive for what he does. (P.S. At least watch Batman Begins if you want to understand Bane's motives). The acting is good, but foolish battle sequences, and an overpowered Batman arsenal takes away from the whole, Batman-works-in-the-night-with-cool-but-not-overpowered-gadgets thing. Unlike the previous movies', the film was much too long and this villain (which did not complement the comics), Bane, is not what most (who knew him) would be expecting.",6,1,2,11 October 2017
Black Panther," It had potential
","The latest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is 'Black Panther', the first Marvel film featuring a predominantly black cast. Black Panther first appeared in 'Captain America: Civil War', with Chadwick Boseman donning the suit of Black Panther, and alter-ego T'Challa, King of Wakanda, a technologically advanced nation hidden in the African continent. After the death of his father, T'Challa, son of T'Chaka, the King, takes the place of the throne, faced with obstacles as soon as he is initiated. Andy Serkis plays Ulysses Klaue, a mercenary stealing technology from Wakanda and selling it, is one of the main antagonists of the picture, giving a fantastic performance as a nonchalant, cockney thief, escaping the claws of the previous king, and now hunted by Boseman. In fact, what makes this film stand-out, is the back-up cast. The sister of T'Challa, played by Letitia Wright, and a clan leader, played by Winston Duke, are two characters who particularly stand-out, and serve as comic-relief for parts of the film. Whereas on the other side of the film, with Chadwick Boseman, are phenomenal pieces of lightning and choreography in a lot of his early battle sequences, paired with a purple-glowing suit (possibly the best suit produced by the MCU for any hero), any action sequence featuring him is exciting and awesome, especially the early battles, where the audience is introduced to the power of the Black Panther, discovering just why this guy is a hero. Speaking of costumes, the costumes of the citizens of Wakanda all vary in colour, being interesting and obviously well made. Despite this, it seems as if the costumes are trying to 'spread the colour' with some, obviously blatant scenes of (costume) colour segregation. This is not helped by CGI which is successful for the majority, but falls short at the scenes of actual animal life, i.e. rhinos. Even though 'Black Panther' is home to some of the best choreography for a Marvel film, the script lets itself down, with a dragged out plot and unnecessary sequences of 'falling only to rise once more' (both literally and metaphorically). From the get go, one thinks, this is close to being one of the best Marvel films of all time, but, short of falling flat on its face, it stumbles over its own plot annoyances, making it equal to 'Doctor Strange' and 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2' when it had the capability to surpass 'Captain America: Civil War' and 'Guardians of the Galaxy' (although it would have had to be extremely good for that to happen).",6,35,77,15 February 2018
Blade Runner," Ridley Scott, you've done it again!
","'Blade Runner' stars Harrison Ford, and is about a detective, known as a blade runner, who must kill replicants (robots). The concept itself is interesting enough, allowing for an endless amount of paths for the film to approach. 'Blade Runner' has an incredibly grim yet beautiful landscape with a seemingly endless torrent of rain which adds atmosphere like hardly any other sci-fi. Deckard (Harrison Ford) is involved in a huge case which results in amazing battle and action sequences. The sets are masterfully created, but the second half of the film is where the pace and story-line heighten with incredible battles and scenes involving Rutger Hauer as Roy (the main replicant antagonist) who delivers a performance making him one of the most memorable antagonists of all time, equalled by the Xenomorph of 'Alien'. Three years, in fact, after the release of 'Alien', Ridley Scott has once more made a spectacular, cult-classic science-fiction film; only this one challenges what the world may eventually succumb toÂ… in just two years time.",9,1,3,13 October 2017
Gladiator," Atmospheric and astounding with view potholes
","At the peak of the Roman army, Maximus, a highly-trusted and beloved general is struck by tragedy as he must fight for vengeance\ Nuanced characters and excellent casting (with casting-director Louis DiGiaimo who also worked on The Godfather, The Exorcist and Thelma and Louise) Russell Crowe (also in A Beautiful Mind) stars in this epic as Maximus, with his main adversary played by Joaquin Phoenix (also stars in Her) as they battle both physically and mentally, each vying for a personal goal, with obvious and well established motives of the characters; hardly surprising seeing as one of the writers is John Logan who also worked as a writer on Skyfall. These motives allow for the characters to become relatable and understandable on most parts, although the downfall is strange and, in one case, uncharacteristic love interest seemingly created for no reason save to adhere to the voyeuristic side of the audience; to make them feel better about particular love interests. Another, yet minor, downfall of the film was within the first twelve minutes where Ridley Scott (also the director of Alien, Thelma and Louise and Blade Runner) felt the constantly annoying need to use slow-motion on the battle and to completely derive from the feeling and atmosphere of battle.Although this aspect was only short, it leaves an impression (especially since it is used very early) but the intensity of the location mixed with the atmospheric climate, allow for the scene to be revered as amazing and leaves the viewer in awe, complimented by a Pirates of the Caribbean-esque soundtrack from Lisa Gerrard and Hans Zimmer (who did work on some Pirates of the Caribbean films). The film does lack some elements of authenticity which its rivals in the war genre do not, although this is crowded by quotable lines delivered by Russell Crowe, and an overall memorable and splendid film.",8,0,1,11 July 2018
Alien: Covenant," Is this HORROR?
","The new movie in the 'Alien' franchise was met with high expectations and much anticipation, and, maybe due to too high expectations, the film was disappointing and veers off the wrong turn of the horror genre: exiting the scary and entering the gory. The film was overly violent, with too much gore, and too many reveals of the highly loved Xenomorph. Throughout the movie, we witness the evolution of the Xenomorph (more commonly known as the Neomorph in this film). But, as this is a prequel to the famous 'Alien', the Xenomorph seems to be over-developed and more powerful than its later version. With new designs for the beloved Chest-Burster, it seems the film desires to be showy instead of story. Plus, the film is a repetition of the previous ones before it. It follows the classic and cliché pattern of:A distress call/ Call to action, forces a random spaceship (with a mentally strong female) to land. Followed by the crew exploring, with mysterious deaths. Then, someone betrays the crew for safety or a personal goal. Finally, we witness the Xenomorph, and the crew must somehow stop it.They are all quite similar story lines, with minor tweaks in the middle. It wasn't the WORST 'Alien' I am yet to witness, just not as good as the previous movies, including the highly critiqued Prometheus'. If you are looking for horror, do not go to this film, go the 1979 version.",6,0,3,12 August 2017
