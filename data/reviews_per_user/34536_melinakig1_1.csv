Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Really good
","Worth watching! I must say, I was waiting for its release with quite an anxiety but also with some fear, didn't want to be disappointed being a Sherlock Holmes fun and all. However it was even better than the first one. Robert D. Junior excels as Sherlock Holmes! Also the villain VERY convincing! You know he will prove to be a worthy adversary from the first scene. Fast, adventurous, funny. A great story nicely put on the big screen. Guy Ritchie has done it once again..anyone who's seen his movies can see some of his touches in this one as well. Also the Picture/photography is excellent, dark taking you back in time. Overall a great job. Will watch it again in the future.",8,1,2,11 January 2012
