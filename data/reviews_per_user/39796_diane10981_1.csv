Marie Antoinette," Just awfully done
","I'm a huge fan of period dramas, historical fiction and anything that is (even if loosely) based on fact. However this film was just painful to watch, it was visually stunning but it was very badly executed. The story was only just apparent in a disjointed sort of way, there was barely a script to string it together and I found several things hard to reconcile to that period. You couldn't relate to the characters and you didn't really care what happened to them, which is bizarre because they were based on real people, real events, things shook history - very disappointing.It felt very Americanised an an uncomfortable mix of period and present. If you like historical films - don't bother watching this one!",1,1,2,24 September 2012
