Come and See," Superb masterpiece you won´t forget
","I am glad i live in a time where i don´t have to experience war personally, but i guess this is the closest you could get to the real deal in cinematic form.
I watched this movie a few years ago and still the images hunt me to this day.
There are many great movies about war and violence out there, but this movie goes a step further which makes you never forget this experience and ranks it for me at the top, even without the great effects we´re so used to see.
Highly recommend it, when you want to get a glimpse of that time and want something to think about long after the credits are done.",9,1,1,21 June 2019
