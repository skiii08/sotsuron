Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," a Star Wars for *our* generation!!!
","From what I've heard, the original Star Wars had a great effect on boys who saw it on the big screen when it originally came out.  I was only like 1 year old at the time, so I missed out on that.  The first time I saw it was on a video tape, and I had already seen the first one or two Star Trek movies by that time, so it didn't seem nearly as groundbreaking to me in terms of special effects, etc.  But I did see The Phantom Menace today, and it was indeed groundbreaking.  I think I felt the same thing, seeing it, that older people felt seeing the original.  I believe this movie sets a new standard for science-fiction action sequences and special effects, and there were parts that brought out deep emotions in me, without being boring.",10,0,0,21 May 1999
