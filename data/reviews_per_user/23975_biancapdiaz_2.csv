It," A Great Adaptation of an Iconic Novel
","IT by Stephen King has to be one of my favorite books; with King being my favorite author/person. With that being said, if you go into this movie (or any movie based off of a book) and expect it to be exactly like the book, then don't bother watching it.
King's novel is gorey, messy, all over the place, and downright horrifying. That's what makes it so great. It's more than a story, it's an experience; you get lost in it. Carrying that over into film, it won't work. Andy Muschietti took his resource, dissected it carefully, and pulled out important pieces. While also giving little easter eggs throughout the film. He created a Pennywise that would intrigue us, scare us. Bill Skarsgard gave us a performance to remember, considering the shoes he had to fill after Tim Curry's portrayal of Pennywise. It is unfair to compare the two. Tim Curry is a horror icon as Pennywise; while Bill Skarsgard held his own in this adaptation.
IT is more than just a horror story. It's a coming of age story. It's a story about love, friendship, overcoming fears, etc. The young cast were amazing as the portrayals of the Losers. The chemistry is unmatched and should be praised for it.",8,0,0,11 September 2019
Hereditary," WOW
","That was my reaction walking out the theatre. I was taken back at how good this film was. I had no idea what the movie was about or what I was getting myself into (which I think played a huge factor in it's effectiveness). Ari Aster created a masterpiece with Hereditary. He placed you in the middle of grief, loss, and real horror. The film is and feels painfully long. That plays into the emotions Aster is trying to get out of his viewers. You never feel 'safe' while you're watching this film. He also takes control of it, leaving you unable to guess what the next scene will be.
I highly recommend watching it. You will not be the same after.",10,2,6,9 September 2019
