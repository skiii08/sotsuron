Captain Phillips," A Masterpiece!
","Not sure how this can be topped: most people will already know the story, so the movie has the task of keeping interest and building tension without cheap tricks and manipulative gimmicks. The story and conflict is multi-leveled, and must be developed while building tension. Hanks gives the performance of a lifetime. The visuals must give us a feel for the vastness of the ocean, the immenseness of a cargo ship, the majesty of our overpowering Navy, danger and desperation, yet successfully play small ball with a cramped lifeboat and villains from another culture. Some say there are better movies, but I'll bet those movies started with a clean slate. Keeping the tension and interest at a high level throughout, and Hanks' 2nd half presentation of a desperate man--and his nuanced yet believable 'breakdown' scene--make this worthy of 10 stars to me. This was a real group effort, from screenwriters, actors, directors, and cinematographers. Other movies can be AS good, but none can top this.",10,0,1,15 March 2014
Casablanca," A contender for 'the perfect movie' category
","What other reviewers overlook is the rapid fire and multi-layered dialogue that just crackles through the first third of the movie as the elements of the plot are established. Almost every 'casual' conversation, brief meeting, or soir√©e involves hidden meanings or jockeying for position (or information) that I find brilliant, and yet, we are IN on it! What more could you ask of a movie? There are enough plot challenges and twists that keep outcomes totally unpredictable. The characters are well developed, act credibly, and there are no outrageous plot twists to rig the outcome. Acting is absolutely first rate by all the main players, with the exception of Paul Henried, whose stiff, mostly reserved personna works in his favor when he leads the legendary and emotional 'anthem competition' scene. The dialogue seems just MADE for Bogart's cynical, world weary delivery...and his facial expressions are a delight to behold. Bergman is electrifying. Rains should have won an award as the opportunistic, slick, Prefect. Intrigue is EVERYWHERE in this movie, and the minimalist lighting, the heavy shadows, the bars and bar-shadows make this an example of a wholly developed, carefully presented, craftily written movie worthy of top consideration as THE best Hollywood can offer.",10,5,6,15 November 2017
American Sniper," Fast-paced story, nuanced performances. GRIPPING !
","Other movies can be as good, but doubt any could be better. I marveled at the performances by Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller and Clint Eastwood's directing before finding out that the movie, Cooper, and Eastwood all were nominated. Miller should have been as well.This is NOT just a war movie but as much a character study of a man in and out of war. You are put right in the action to feel the depth of Chris Kyle's service and dedication. Cooper's performance is nothing short of stunning: no space for over-the-top demonstrations of anger or detachment, but must be communicated in nuanced ways. At times, he comes across as a citizen in a documentary. Similarly, I thought Sienna Miller's performance the same way, as she must put us through the range of emotions at varying times. Eastwood avoids cloyingly trite performances and melodrama to let the power of the story play out. This is NOT a glorification of war but is a tribute to man's calling. Some liberals have disparaged this movie as glorifying killing. HARDLY. Some have taken a quote--'...savages...' out of context as well. There is a lot of depth to the components of this story. You'd be best off to ignore the political posturing and let the story affect you independently of the 'framing.' In short, unbelievably well crafted and well presented.",10,17,41,19 January 2015
1917," I also don't get all the raves.....
","Cinematography, setting, were absolutely great. Acting great. The feeling that 'you were there' --great. And it draws you in. Only one scene seems unnecessary--gratuitous (the scene with the mother and child), but like so many others pointed out, PLOT HOLES, PLOT HOLES, PLOT HOLES, turning this into what I generally hates about American movies--outrunning bullets and implausible situations.
Would LOVE for someone to legitimately explain:
1. The two start out over open country with the distinct possibility of being picked off, yet start with bayonets fixed, though crawling past/over barbed wire WITH bayonets. Later, when in the burned out town with German infestation at close range, no bayonet, just when needed. Also,
2 The soldier runs off without his rifle. To me, this is inexplicable: hostile territory, behind enemy lines, and he's going to outrun bullets and enemy soldiers, dodging this way and that (as he did in the trench, astonishingly).
Thanks.
The close-range shooting by the injured German sniper also bothered me--just a flesh wound, eh.
The French mother holed up with her child in a nasty burned out town infested with Germans...strange but not a plot issue.
Certainly strong points to the movie, but coming off as cartoonish in plot action. Still, the action is compelling. Sometimes found the accents hard to understand, particularly when talking as 'asides' or muttering to one another.
I don't understand the need for some to try to wish this into a true story. It was never pitched as true, and doesn't need to be. Other war moves (Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Saving Private Ryan, Hamburger Hill) do a great job of communicating the horrors of war. Some '10'-raters seem to treat this as a genre-setting standard, which I don't see.",6,1,4,18 February 2020
