"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," screwball comedy --2008 style, I loved it.
","David Schwimmer in his directorial debut,proves he is as good a director as he is an actor (Friends). Micheal Ian Black & Simon Pegg wrote the screenplay which is basically a screwball comedy.This is no where like the screwball comic farces of the 1930's, It is however a screwball comedy 2008 style.This was a 2008 release in the USA.Please do not expect a plausible, realistic story line, Screwball comedies are never plausible or realistic, They are just funny & silly.Run, Fatboy,Run is a is both funny & silly & at all times enjoyable. At no times is it supposed to be taken seriously, Just sit back & enjoy these talented actors having fun.The talented actors are Simon Pegg, he is a physical comic whose facial expressions,make his somewhat unlikable character seem real. Very few can do this well, Simon Pegg does this superbly.Thandie Newton, what a beauty & what an actress, she can handle comedy as well as she does dramas.Hank Azaria can do roles where he can switch to being a villain very easily, here he does it perfectly. Hank & Simon have locker room scene that is a quiet laugh riot.These are the 3 main members of the cast, I must mention others as they sure add to the fun.Dylan Moran an Irish comic who was in a few other Simon Pegg films & is quietly very humorous.Haresh Patel an actor from South Asia is very good & he know how to use a spatula for other things than cooking.Mathew Fenton a lad about 5 is perfect Thandie & Simons son.Much of the movie was filmed in beautiful North London,with fantastic scenes of London in the background. The last part of the movie is a Marathon race, with both Simon & Hank participating, they both love Thandie. Which one will get her, Will one of them win the marathon, Hank is fit enough to win anything, Simon however (he is not fat, just not in shape.) I will not tell you the ending. This is a screwball comedy, & not reality, & thats what made it so enjoyable for me,Ratings: ***1/2 (out of 10)95 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)",9,0,1,1 November 2008
Angels & Demons," Ron Howard's excellent adaptation of Dan Brown's Exciting novel.
","It is a hard job to adapt novels into screenplays, then into a film as exciting & thrilling as the original novel. There have & always will be changes made,hopefully for the better.Akiva Goldman & David Knoep have adapted Dan Brown's exciting thrilling novel in an excellent, exciting & thrilling movie.The changes made were mainly due to cast choices & editing the novel to a proper running time. Ron Howard's direction is crisp & tight. As we know this is a sequel to THE DA VINCI CODE.I, for one did not care for THE DA VINCI CODE. Angels & Demons is a far better movie.Since the film story happens in about an 18 hour time span,there are no unneeded flashbacks or back-story,(a few short scenes tells all).There is also no time for any sort of love story. Adding one would have been very unrealistic.Tom Hanks is much better as Langdon this time out. Ayalot Zurer an Isreali actress is a co-scientist. helping Langdon solve this puzzle.As he always is, Ewan MacGregor fits his role like a kid glove. The other main cast members also are international stars. Stellen Skarsgaard, Armen Mueller Stahl and Pierfrancisco Favino, who is an up & coming star from Italy.The Special Visual & Audio effects are just magnificent. Obviously they could not film in the Vatican or St. Peters Square, The effects are so good you cannot tell that these scenes are not the real thing.NOTE, there are only two explosions one part way into the film & the final one. This is the right way to do special effects.The story has great stunt work, BUT not the phony stuff we see in other films. The film does have a few flaws. what film does not, just sit back like I did & enjoy. one more thing, great music score by Hanz Zimmer.Ratings: **** (out of 4) 97 points(out of 100) IMDb 10 out of 10)",10,1,3,25 November 2009
Black Swan," where is this a Horror film. See below for one way.
","Black Swan is a mess of a film. I cannot understand all the great reviews.They say its a horror film, NOT TO ME. It is a long bore with good music & some very good ballet scenes.Blood on a costume does not make this a horror film. The director Darren Aronofsky did not do his usual fine work.Natalie Portman & the rest of the cast were OK.I have seen Swan Lake & do like it, BUT as shown in this bore, I did not enjoy it.I think this is 10 lines,it is not worth even 5 lines.",6,0,2,26 April 2011
The New World," A very beautiful BUT extremely boring film.
","Terrence Malick' is an overlong but beautiful made film of the founding of Jamestown Va.in 1607, & of the trails & tribulations of 2 societies trying to get along. Of course when you have characters named Captain Smith & Rolfe & Pocahontas, we have romance. Colin Farrel & Christian Bale are fine as our heroes, , The actress who portrays teen age Pocahontas looks much too old to do proper justice to the part, She does a good job however. We have seen this tale many times, & learned this in school in the third grade.There are a few battle skirmishes which are well done, This film should have been better edited, as it seems to go on forever,Rating **1/2 (out of 10) 76 points (out of 100) IMDb 6 (out of 10)",6,1,5,30 November 2006
Frost_Nixon," I must not have seen the same film as those that raved about it.
","Most reviews that I have read on this film have been absolute raves,Apparntly I must have seen a different film as I did not feel entertained or enlightened in watching a film about the downfall of President Richard M. Nixon.A few years back Oliver Stone wrote & directed the film NIXON starring Anthony Hopkins, to me this was an excellent movie as it covered Mr. Nixon's entire life.This film is based on Peter Morgan's stage play,He also wrote the screen for this movie which has been carefully directer by Ron Howaed.It stars Frank Langella & Micheal Sheen who also did the same roles on stage. Mr. Langella is a noted actor from primarily Stage & Television. Mr. Sheen is mostly known for his excellent role as Prime Minister Tony Blair in THE QUEEN.They both are quite good as Richard Nixon & David Frost. For those who do not know, Mr Frost was a noted Television interviewer & wit.The supporting cast however is even better than the 2 stars.Sam Rockwell, Kevin Bacon, Oliver Platt & Toby Jones excel as aides & associates of both leads. Rebecca Hall has the major distaff part,Pat Nixon (the Presidents wife) is very nicely done by ex-child actress Patty McCormack (BAD SEED).The costumes & settings are excellent I felt I was back in the time period.Dear Readers , note I have said little about the script, It has its moments, just not enough of them. For the first hour or so I was watching a competent film, It wasn't until the scene where both Noxon & Frost are talking in the phone very late at night.That scene made me pay attention to the rest of the film.I never saw the original interviews (films subject matter) when they were on Television, It was during Tax Season & I had more pressing things to do.i feel this is a good movie, just not the great film many say it is.Ratings: *** (out of 4) 81 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)",7,0,4,1 May 2009
Mission: Impossible III," first rate entertainment
","Finally they have got it almost right. This part is close to the spirit of the famous TV series of years back.Tom Cruise is as usual a perfect Ethan Hunt doing impossible stunts. In part 111, they are a bit more realistic than in the prior 2 filmsPhilip Seymour Hoffman is the main villain, OH yes there is another villain, it would be a spoiler if I named him. Of course Mr. Hoffman is superb.The entire productions is first rate, the final scenes are filmed in Shanghai, It looks so modern,it almost makes me want to go thereRating ***1/2 (out of 4) 91 points( out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)",8,0,1,7 November 2006
3:10 to Yuma," a re-do of the 1957 film with Glenn Ford & Van Heflin.
","I gave the 1957 version a rating of 9 as well as this one, Normally remakes rarely if ever get as good a review the second time around.This version starring Russell Crowe & Christian Bale is a near copy of the original, They did change a few things & nearly every one is for the better. The original film was made in the time of the censors, Thankfully today we are much more realistic, (men are not fully shaved & groomed in every set up, Sets & costumes are not brand new in every scene etc)Both films are violent, in this version the scenes are more realistic.Both films are based on an Elmore Leonard short story he wrote in 1953. Neither screenplay is historically accurate, the writers were faithful to Mr.Leonard's thinkingThe acting by both Russell Crowe & Christian Bale are perfect, as well as the entire supporting cast,an extra kudos to Ben Foster (ex juvenile star) the psycho cohort of Crowes character,, Yiu can really apply many things to his relationship to Crowe.Gretchen Moll plays as Christian Bale's wife is good, The lad who plays their oldest son also very good. (this is a much larger role than in the 1957 version.My only semi-gripe is (SPOILER ALERT) what happens at the ending with Bale's character.Ignore the illogical spots in the film, just enjoy the superb acting & great productionratings ***1/2 (out of 4) 95 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)",9,2,5,9 January 2008
The Young Victoria," More like a Lifetime Cable Channel film than a major motion picture.
","The story of Queen Victoria & her beloved Consort Prince Albert,is one of the most beautiful romantic stories ever lived.The events & lives portrayed occurred in the mid-19th century. I did not feel transported back to that time period.Granted the settings & costumes were beautiful,BUT the atmosphere was too modern for me.The screenwriter is mainly at fault, Julien Fellows should learn more about the period & people he writes about. A few years back he wrote the screenplay for GOSFORD PARK,luckily that film movie had Robert Altman to direct,his direction did help the weak screenplay seem better.The director this time is Jean-Marie Vallee, his direction failed to bring these 2 dynamic personalities to life.Emily Blunt is a good actress, she however was not Queen Victoria,besides the fact she was too tall,she was not convincing in many scenes, A better director would have made her more like the Victoria of history.Rupert Friend as Albert, at least tried, he too could have benefited by a better director.Paul Bettany was OK as Melbourne & all the other did give good , if not great performances/As I said the sets & costumes were great,the film itself was not.Ratings: **1/2 (out of 4) 72 points (out of 100) IMDb 6 (out of 100)",6,2,3,21 April 2010
The Hangover," This film is the craziest,nuttiest farce, satiric comic mess in years/
","The Hangover is without a-doubt pure insanity. It is an impossible plot about a wedding bachelor party,that goes so far off kilter,that it is hard to believe any of it. It is pure comic, satiric mayhem from beginning to end.Todd Phillips directed this (how I do not know),Josh Lucas & Scott Moore wrote & devised the screenplay. It is very profane BUT not too objectionable. . The stuff that goes on,is a comic Hallucintory dream fantasy.Nothing makes sense & nothing is supposed to..Years back, the comic teams of The Ritz Brothers and The Three Stooges made silly impossible comic gems,Also The Marx Brothers early Paramount films were this unbelievable.Do not expect anything believable,just go with the flow. The cast is mostly newcomers to film, & all do very well.The leads are Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Justin Bartha & Zach Galifianakis. Heather Graham is a delight in major female role. Mike Tyson & Mike Epps also are on hand Filmed in Las Vegas.Las Vegas is pure insanity to begin with.Do not even try to believe any of what you see. Just accept the insanity & have fun.Ratings ***1/2 (out of 4) 91 points(out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)",9,1,2,21 January 2010
Marie Antoinette," so sweet, so nice, but not a history lesson
","This film is not for diabetics, as it is overly sweet & nice.just like all the sugary desserts & confections on display.Miss Coppola made a pretty to look at film about a royal teen aged King & Queen. There is no action scenes in the film except for a mob scene at the palace at the end of film,before the family is arrested.If you do not know the actual events of this unfortunate pair, & what eventually happens, you will be lost.Even though there is some historical truth told, DO not use this as a history lesson unless you are in the third grade (7-8 years old).Its a pleasant film nicely acted, ( no award nominations though). No one performance stands out for mention.The sets, costumes etc. are nice to look at & do seem real. The main jarring note is the modern song score, it dilutes the value of the film, Hearing a modern type song by todays performers does not fit the 1780's period.If you want something light & frothy see this,its likable & at times humorous.This is the kind of film we used to say were----5 minute films----5 minutes after seeing it, you forget why you liked it..rating: *** (out of 4)-- 82 points (out of 100)__ IMDb 7 (out of 10)",7,0,1,21 March 2007
In Bruges," This should be on many 10 best lists for 2008
","Martin McDonagh a noted stage director & writer has fashioned this very original,dark comedy into one of the best films so far this year.NOTE on the script & the use of foul language. Normally I despise the excessive use of the 'F' word. In the script & the way these fine actors use them it seems natural & normal.Colin Farrell & Brendan Gleeson are 2 hit men hiding out (in plain sight) in the Medieval city BRUGES BELGIUM, they are waiting to hear from there boss superbly enacted by Ralph Fiennes. In fact all 3 actors could be nominated for acting honours at this years end.I must also mention the following players for there outstanding work,Clemencie Posey as a native lass of the city,She is new & a breath of fresh air, hopefully she will be in many more films.Also Jordan Prentice just about steals the few scenes he is in, He happens to be Dwarf & has great talent & promise as an actor.The entire production is first rate.NOTE,, Bruges dates back to the 12 th century & most buildings are many hundreds of years old. They seem very well preserved. (Gee Whiz, here in the good 'ole' USA,If a building is 50 years old its torn down & we do nothing about it.)Due to the language & subject matter as well as some violence at the conclusion I do not recommend this for children, ALSO there are NO CGI action scenes, It is a film with great dialogue between the actors, mainly between Farrell & Gleeson.DO NOT MISS THIS FILM . It will be high on most best lists.Ratings ****(out of 4) 98 points (out of 100) IMDb 10 (out of 10)_",10,10,17,1 July 2008
I'm Not There," As a film I liked it, it is at least interesting.
","I must admit, I know next to nothing about Bob Dylan, If I had heard any of his songs, they would have meant nothing to me at all. I never was into protest music, Pete Seegar turned me off on this music when I was involved with some left wing friends, before the Korean Conflict.This film was co-written,directed & produced by TODD HAYNES,to me he is a brilliant filmmaker, He has made only a few films, I wish he would make more.I liked the idea of having 6 different actors (one a black youth & another the vibrant actress Cate Blanchette) portray different views of Dylan's makeup. He seems to be a very complex man & this does come out in the screenplay.The acting & production credits are all first rate.The reason I cant give this a higher rating the songs did nothing for me.I recommend this for all those that like Bob Dylan & his music.Ratings *** (out of 4) 82 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)",7,2,3,9 May 2008
Star Trek," A pure delight for adventure film lovers.
","For the last 40 plus years we have had many Star Trek films, There also have been a few Television series.One would think we would be in very familiar territory. WE ARE, but with a refreshing difference,this film as about the very start of our decades long adventures. We have a bright new young cast portraying these characters in there first voyage when they were in there late teens & twenties.The cast comprises young faces from Television & film, one brand new actor & a few veterans.The director is also young; JJ Abrams, he does a first class job,'Zachary Quinto in his first role is Spock. We will see more of him. Chris Pine is Jim Kirk, & all I can say he is wonderful. Zoe Zoldana is Uhuru (may be spelled wrong. Simon Pegg,Karl Uban, John Cho & Anton Yelchin round out the crew, Eric Bana is our villainLeonard Nimoy is Spock (large cameo) & Winona Ryder also appears,They All are very well cast and do very well.The entire production is fast & furious & expertly done. Excellent special effects & lots of old fashioned adventure film thrills..Now if the script were a bit more adult my rating would have been higher, But who goes to an exciting adventure film for the story. It is a great 127 minutes, I had fun. To be honest I have loved this type film since the mid 1930's when I saw a similar film from same studio, Paramount, this studio is known to make exciting movies like this.Ratings: ***1/2 (out of 4) 92 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10) \.",9,2,8,18 November 2009
Coraline," Wow, an animated movie with an actual story.
","A brilliantly conceived animated film.Another non Disney-Pixar effort which is much better.I am a senior citizen as most of you all know. I like my animated films a bit more serious, such as this and 9 (earlier this year.)Our young heroine voiced by Dakota Fanning is ever so disenchanted by her real parents (did we not all have this feeling at least once. She creates another family (there is always a secret door isn't there.)Without giving anything else away, we do find out there is no place like home.There are plenty of laughs & some songs.This is a very well made enjoyable film for the entire family.Ratings: ***1/2 (out of 4) 91 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)",9,1,3,28 January 2010
Iron Man 2," At least this has more humor than the original film.
","Two years ago I was bored with part one,I was not as bored this time out. This sequel written & directed by same team that made part one is more fun to watch. Jon Favroux directed & Justin Theroux wrote the screenplay,which was taken from Stan Lee's comic strip. Robert Downey Jr, Gwyneth Paltrow are leads,Cheadle replaces Terrence Howard,the villain this time out is Mickey Rourke. Sam Rockwell,Samuel Jackson are on board as well. Scarlett Johansson in a red wig is here as well.All are talented & do perform well under Jon Favroux's very capable direction.Running time before the credits is about 113 minutes,over 90 of them are well done computer effects.I do hope they forget about doing part 3,.there is nothing that memorable about the characters to warrant another film.\ My ratings say it all. a low 3 star rating.Ratings: *** (out of 4) 81 points (out of 100) 7 (out of 10)",7,0,1,28 September 2010
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," I almost shut this off after 30 minutes, glad I did not now,
","Yes, I was about to shut this off after about 30 minutes,there were a few reasons,mainly I did not know who the people playing the leads were, the plot seemed silly & I felt the 2 leads were very annoying.I am very glad now I stayed to the end. I do not quite understand the very high ratings; I would up enjoying most of it.The director is Nicholas Stoller & he does do a nice job directing a cast of mostly Unknowns (to me at least)Jason Segal wrote the screenplay & enacts the lead role,He is a tall man & we do see ALLof him. His early scenes, I did not care for, he is a good comic & he did finally win me over. Kristin Bell a pretty blond did not win me over. Mila Kunis a very pretty & lovely brunette did win me over, she definitely has talent. Russell Brand an English actor is quite good. Bill Hader plays Jasons step-brother & I feel he gave the best performance of the male actors.The only 2 names I recognized, Jonah Hill (the heavy-set waiter) & Paul Rudd as the Surf-riding instructor were very good in there shorter roles. Personally, I want to see Paul Rudd in featured roles,To me HE IS A STAR.Be sure to stay thru the extras on the DVD, you will find out all bout the use of the puppets in the last scenes. Very inventive.It seems it was the writers idea, before he even started the screenplay.Most of the film was made in beautiful Hawaii.This is not a Four Star film by any means, but it is good & I think most people who like raunchy sex scenes will like the movieRatings: *** (out of 4) 82 points(out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)",7,1,4,2 October 2008
Shaun of the Dead," I did not even smile once.
","I cannot quite understand how this has gotten a high rating. I found it very dull & uninteresting,not the slightest bit funny.I rented this on the basis of the write up on the latest Simon Pegg film.RUN FATBOY RUN. which stated that Shaun was funnier. It seems we saw different films.Now to be fair I will admit not being a fan of Zombie films,I did not even see 28 Days or the sequel. I also do not care that much for comic horror movies..I like psychological horror movies where all the frightening scenes are in your mind.In Shaun of the Dead, the acting was fair & the production was OK. If this was supposed to be a comedy, I wasn't laughing. It did not come over as a horror movie either, I was dozing off every few minutes it was so boring.Ratings: ** (out of 10) 52 points (out of 100) IMDb 4 (out of 10)",4,2,7,13 November 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," the 7 rating is for the superb production
","At 150 minutes this sequel is about 50 minutes too darn long.There are too many (al-be-it) superb technical computer graphic effects.I had trouble keeping my eyes open,as much of the movie was downright boring.Johhny Depp is not as good as he was in the first film, Here his overly comic turn is not that amusing. Orlando Bloom tries hard to be a hero, Keihra Knightly is our heroic heroine who fights LIKE SHE IS A MAN. SHE IS OK.This is a Disney movie that has too many violent scenes,RATING *** (OUT OF 4)82 POINTS (OUT OF 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)NOTE RATING IS BASED ON EXCELLENT PRODUCTION VALUESQ & not story or acting.",7,0,2,7 December 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Dull, Dreary & Dreadful & that is being kind.
","This film is from the Walt Disney Studios, who used to make fantasy films by the multi dozens.I have realized that the magic of Mr Disney has been slipping since his death. This piece of cinematic garbage as to be the worst film ever released by The Disney Co.There is no magic or wonderment shown here, about 110 minutes of boredom followed by computer generated effect scenes, killing all the bad people, There is supposed to be a religious parable involved. Its there all right, but almost laughable/If you want to see a film with a religious parable rent WELCOME BACK, MISS MARY , this minor B movie says more about the love of God, Jesus & man, than one frame of this one.Tilda Swintion is the major names actor this, she is the White Witch.a mean rotten witch (spell it with a b) She shows not one bit of menace just over/under acting. Liam Neeson does the voice of Aslan the Lion (supposedly---Jesus------sorry he did not convince me). There are 4 children in this well of different ages, the youngest lassie smiled & was sort of cute, The 2 older were typical English lads of the period, (suprised that they were not caned as boys of that period were often caned or slippered), the other sister is typical mid-teen.The kids in both the Harry Potter films & the Lord of the Rings films were much much better, . The special effects were typical CGI.. The director did the 2 SHREK films, they were animated & much better, maybe this too should have been animated.Do NOT wast time or money on this.Rating * )out of 4),25 points (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10)BTW if over 65 years of rating films I have rated under 100 films this low. this is definitely one of the WORST OF ALL TIME",1,1,6,2 September 2006
The Other Boleyn Girl," Another historical fiction on Henry V111 & his Loves.
","This movie is based on a novel & like many novels about the Tudor's & a current cable TV series it is pure fiction.Now this time period has fascinated me since I was a small child in the 1930's & saw a few films on this period of time; being a nosy young lad I asked my father about certain facts, He being a wonderful father, advised me to go to the library & look it up. (found out much later he did not know the answers to my questions---------- I am real glad now as I became a history buff)When I am through writing this review I shall go to the encyclopedia & look up a few of the characters & find some of the truth.I do not go to see films for its accuracy to details, I go to be entertained.. This film was about 90% inaccurate, I did not expect more. The acting by Eric Bana,Natalie Portman & Scarlett Johannsen as Henry V111, Anne Bolwyn & her sister Anne, is good all the other performers are good as well; so are the production values.What this needed was stronger director, than newcomer,Justin Chadwick.Non-the-less the film still was entertaining,this seemed to be made in the old-fashioned way,with a minimum of violence.Ratings: *** (Out of 4) 83 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)",7,0,0,27 June 2008

Black Book," Faultyy but still an superbly made & acted movie.
","Paul Verhooven has made a Dutch Language film after many years in Hollywood.This tale of the last months of the German Occupation of Holland & the resistance movement plays like a soap opera,it is very melodramatic, Our heroine has more perils than Pauline ever did.It is a long film nearly two & one half hours long. Interest is maintained throughout BUT we all have sat through many similar films since the war ended over 50 years ago.Non-the-less, the superb acting & excellent production values more than makes up for the deficiencies in the story.

Pirate Radio," U.S. release title is PIRATE RADIO
","The music of the 1960's, was & is the basis of our current popular music. This is itself enough of a reason to to view it.The script however by Richard Curtis is quite awkward at times & quite confusing at other times.He also directed it. Try as it may, the humor doesn't seem to come over as funny as it should,I also wonder how accurate the ending is.(SPOILER) Boat sank all survived.The production is first rate & the acting quite good. Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Philip Seymour Hoffman are the most well known names. They as usual are great. The rest of cast is quite good,( a few characters are stereotypical),BUT they are all well done.For those who fondly remember the music of the period the movie is a MUST.

Superbad," This is not a laugh riot nor is it the absolute worst film.
","Seth Rogan & Adam Goldberg wrote the screenplay,they supposedly started to write this when they were about 13 years old.To be blunt some of the lines are what 12 & 13 year olds might say.BUT the characters in the film are about to graduate High School, who want to lose there virginity. Now that is the dream of most high school students. The 3 lads in this film act & talk like they were about 12 or 13 & not High School students about to go to college. This in my opinion ruins what could of been another American GRAFFITI (the classic 1973 movie).Jonah Hill,Micheal Cera & Christopher Mimtz-Plasse are our 3 lads.Only Jonah is way above 18, the other are about the right age.I somehow enjoyed there antic behaviour BUT they were never believable,they acted like the way 12 year olds act.Seth Rogan & Bill Hader play 2 police officers,both are gifted performers BUT the police in 'CAR 54,WHERE ARE YOU ' were smarter,even the police in the 'Police Academy' series were not as stupid as these 2.There are also some lovely young female students as well, they do come over much better than the guys, they seemed like high school students.The movie is very raunchy with much coarse dialog,most of a sexual nature.I was a high school student 60 years ago, I don't think I doubt if I ever met any characters like those portrayed here.I cannot recommend this film to anyone, why it was so popular is beyond me/Ratings ** (out of 4) points 62 (out of 100 IMDb 5 (out of 10)",5,1,3,26 January 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," pure fantasy,not to be taken seriously. I enjoyed it.
","This is pure fantasy folks, the very title tells you that. It is also from a comic book. When I was a lad the only super-heroes we had was Superman & Batman. When they made film adaptations, they were 12-15 chapters seen only on Saturday Matinees. Each chapter ended in a cliff-hanging scene & you had to come back next week to see what happened.In this day & age they spend over 100 Million dollars per film. The serials were pretty bad, BUT as kids we loved them.That is enough history, we must comment on the present film.It is good entertainment; at least the first 80 minutes are, the last 25 minutes does have the tendency to drag, not fatally though. The special effects (computer generated) are first rate. The acting by all is good. The director was Gavin Hood,The screenplay was written by David Benioff & Skip Ward, The cast does have some of the better performers of today.Hugh Jackman is Wolverine & he is most effective. He better be cause the two villains are equally good. Liev Schrieber & Danny Huston fit these parts like a glove. Ryan Reynolds,Dominic Monaghan & Will i. Am are other mutants. Lynn Collins is the required female in the cast.This is a good action, special effect film for the entire family. The violence is pure comic book.

Brokeback Mountain," Another Milestone in film history
","Throughout the history of films, there have been hundreds if not thousands of movies, that hinted (some more bluntly than others, that 2 men can love one another.Various motion picture codes & regulation had said this cannot be done.FINALLY Focus Pictures under the superb direction of ANG LEE have at last shattered the restrictive mold.BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is the tale of 2 young (19 years at start of film) HEATH LEDGER & JAKE GYLLENHAAL who are hired by RANDY QUAID to care for a flock of sheep during the winter months high up on this desolate mountain. One cold night,to keep warm they sleep together, being young & virile males, they do more than sleep.These are modern cowboys doing what comes naturally when alone with nothing else to do.At the end of the season they go their separate ways, BUT over the next 20 years they do meet every so often to rekindle this love they feel to one another.They do marry & have children, they are like everyone of us, except they have this secret shared only by themThis film was written by LARRY McMURTRY & DIANA OSSANA, taken from an award winning short story by ANNIE PROUX.This superb film will assuredly be nominated for many award & will win many Oscars,I could not find a false not in any scene, the Editing is flawless, The total times of the Nudity & Sex scenes is less than 5 minutes spread through much of the film.This is an emotional film also a sad tragic film, not for children. but A MUST OR ALL CARING ADULTS WHO LOVE GOOD MOVIES LIKE I DO.Rating ****/4 99 points /100 IMDb 10/10",10,18,33,10 December 2005
Juno," A wonderful treat
","Juno is to put it succinctly a delicious treat to be savoured & relished BUT not to be taken too seriously.Diablo Cody in her first screenplay has written a wish-fulfillment tale of a pregnant teen ager & how she wonderfully copes with this.Many things here really would not occur in a real situation.,BUT just imagine how wonderful life would be if all that occurred really did happen.Understanding boy-friend,supportive parents & teachers, OH what a nice dream & I, that they too fell under its charm.Jason Reitman (son of Ivan ) directed this & I feel his career will be as big as his fathers.Ellen Page is Juno & she has deserved all the praise & rewards she has gotten.Micheal Cera is a delight as her Romeo.Jennifer Garner & Jason Batemen are very good as the prospective adoptive parents.The wonderful Alison Janney is Juno's step-mom (near perfect step-mom).J.K, Simmons is Juno's very supportive father, (a far cry from the sadist he was in HBO's OZ)is very good.& one more kudoRainn Wilson in a cameo at beginning of film, another small gem from him.The entire film was made in British Columbia, & is very beautiful to look at. There is also a very long song score, they I found enjoyable , at many lyrics had plot & story points.This is a film nearly the entire family can see.parent may have some questions from the little one.Re-stating this is a wish-fulfillment story, not to be confused with real life.Ratings **** (out of 4) 97 points(out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)",10,11,24,18 April 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Part 1- confusing//Part 2--dull & uninteresting//Part 3 --Fast furious GOOD time
","I put the DVD in my player at 6:30 PM & before you knew it the times was 9:20 PM The 2 hour 50 Minute running time just sped by. The pirate adventure has many things happening & it went so fast, you had no time to think about the stupidity of the script, or the delightful over acting of some of the cast.Johnny Depp as usual was great as Jack. Geoffrey Rush as Capt. Barbarossa has a field day. Orlando Bloom, handsome, virile hero. & of course Kierra Knightly who is fast becoming a top actress. Besides being beautiful,she knows her way on a sound stage. Bill Nighy as Davy Jones wearing makeup tentacles, was also great.Gore Verbinski directed from a screenplay by Tim Elliot & Jerry Rossi.This director like Cecil B DeMille & Steven Speilburg knows how to move a large cast about.

Yes Man," Jim Carrey has toned down his crazy antics..I LIKE that very much.
","Thankfully Jim Carrey has toned down the crazy antics he used to use,he is still doing crazy silly things,BUT since he has gotten more mature. his comedy has toned down & he has become a much better performer. He is not a one may show in YES MAN, the other characters do there share of the comedy.As usual there is a love interest & the marvelous Zooey Deschanel is it this time,Her role is nearly as crazy as his is. As I have said prior about her, she will be a big star soon, she has talent to spare.Peyton Reed directed this from the screenplay by Nicholas Stollen,Jared Paul & Andrew Mogel; The adapted the non-fiction book by Danny Wallace.Adding to the comic hi-jinx are Bradley Cooper, John Micheal Higgins,Rhys Darby & Danny Masterson as his buddies.Terrance Stamp who has been a STAR since his first role BILLY BUDD in 1962,is well cast & as always you can believe what he says.I thoroughly enjoyed this & I think you all will as well. Be sure to say to the credits, as there is one additional stunt scene that is quite exciting.Ratings: *** (out of 4) 88 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10) ++++ farces such as this rarely get a higher rating.",8,6,9,6 June 2009
The Last Song," Cliché ridden badly directed from Disney( Touchstone)
","This is another BAD film from Touchstone. Apparently the magic that was Disney is no more. The screenplay for this mess was written by Nicholas Sparks, He wrote the novel after he did the screenplay,Hopefully he omitted all the clichés that are in the movie.It seems that most films from this once great studio are now cliché ridden,there are scenes after scenes that we all have seen too many times.This in itself is not that great a sin as many films have an overabundance of clichés.What does this in is the acting & direction. Julie Anne Robinson did not do a good job at the helm.Miley Cyrus is the star, besides the fact she cannot act, she is very unappealing, she shows no screen presence at all. Greg Kinneer tries to give a credible performance.as her father. Liam Hemsworth is the romantic lead opposite Miley,He at least is good looking& tries hard. Bobby Colemanas the typical younger brother is near perfect.There are many songs in the film,NONE done live,Miley is supposed to be a singer I do not know what if any songs she sang, nor do I care.Nice scenery of the coast in Georgia.It is not even worthwhile as a rental.Ratings: *1/2* (out of 4) 36 points (out of 100) IMDb 3 (out of 10)",3,9,14,27 September 2010
Milk," A very well deserved award winner.
","Since films began over 100 years ago,there have been many biographies of well known personalities. Some have been good, some bad and some excellent.MILK is one of the excellent ones.Using a screenplay by newcomer Dustin Lance Black,(He has deserved every award he has so far been given)Gus Van Sant has directed this simple but powerful story of the last eight years in the life of Harvey Milk.Mr. MIlk was 40 when he left his hum-drum job & life in New York City & moved to San Francisco.He opened a Camera store on Castro street, This was 1970 & the Gay Rights Movement was just starting. Harvey was motivated to do something for this righteous cause He became a politician.He ran for public office (District Supervisor) twice before he finally one.He was one of the first gay man to win a major election.This film is also about Dan White, another supervisor.Mr. White was a sad dissatisfied man,who Murdered 2 men. Mayor George Mosconi & Supervisor Harvey Milk. This awful act helped creating new laws giving Gay & Lesbian people proper HUMAN rights.Sean Penn becomes Harvey Milk, his powerful multi-award winning portrayal will be remembered for many years to come.Josh Brolin is Dan White, this too is a memorable performance.James Franco, Emile Hirsch & Diego Luna are excellent as the very good friends of Harvey. Allison Pell excels as the Lesbian leader.One more person to commend Denis O'hare.he takes on the role of Dan Briggs the bigoted assemblyman, I mention him as a point of interest as, he is a Gay activist when not acting.The entire film was superbly made in San Francisco,including the opening scene,in a New York Subway station.(A BART station was used instead).This is a properly rated R film,BUT no scene is overly explicit.I know I will see this again, I think many people will.Ratings: ****(out of 4) 99 points(out of 100) IMDb 10(out of 10)",10,3,7,12 March 2009
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Guillermo del Toro does it again.
","Once more we suspend belief & enter the extraordinary, imaginative mind of this gifted writer & director. GUILLERMO DEL TORO. Last year he gave us both Pan's Labrynth & Hellboy. Now we have 'Hellboy part 2 -The Golden Army' Ron Perlman once more is this mutant creature.The story is pure fictional fantasy. Over the years we have seen this type tale endless times, BUT Mr.del-Toro has this gift to make it seem fresh & alive Now with computer graphics we can create these strange creatures & bring his wild imagination come to life & thrill is again.The entire cast is first rate,each one having there own 'lil' quirks. Ably assisting Ron Perlman are Selma Blair, Jeffrey Tambor, & John Hurt. They are the good guys, Our main villains are twins,a brother-sister due, played with delightful relish by Luke Goss & Anna Walton.The settings, costumes etc are first rate, The creature make-up is exceptional & with the excellent special effects, could easily be Oscar worthy.See this for pure enjoyments sake, Kids of all ages will love it,the 'lil' ones may be somewhat frightened at some spots.I do hope there will be a part 3.Ratings *** (out of 4) 88 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)",8,1,1,17 January 2009
Once," I agree with all the negatives
","To be fair in my review I only saw about 15 minutes of this dull, dreary, boring film.Just checked, if I have the spoiler box checked I DOThis opens with a guy badly singing a dreary song on a badly tuned guitar. Next a younger dude tries to rob him.(this scene had promise but went no where. Then next scene its dark out & here he is singing another bad, sad song, a girl is watching him & listening with sad eyes. I think this took about 15 minutes or it seemed that long, the credits started, I then shut the movie off.I really feel sorry for those who spent up to $ 14. per ticket to see this. If I saw it in the theatre, I would have demanded my money back, BTW it is permissible to ask for your money back if you see under 20 minutes of any movie. they will refund your money, After 20 minutes you will get a re-admit.Now if I saw this in one of todays multi-plexes, I would have walked into another theatre.Its really unfair to rate this, BUT rating is based on what I saw,Rating * (out of 4) 22 points (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10)",2,8,33,19 December 2007

","I   have been seeing films  for at least 65 years. I always have been a fan of war films, Some were bad, some good, some excellent & a very few  superior, WE WERE SOLDIERS  is  without any doubt one of the very best war films ever  made. Randal Wallace both wrote & directed this from a book by  Lt Col.,Moore (portrayed by  Mel Gibson) This is the story of a 3 day epic battle at the beginning of the Vietman conflict in 1965.

Pan's Labyrinth," one of the best
","Pan's Labrynth is without a doubt of one best films of 2006. It did receive 3 Oscars, It deserved more.This is a harrowing, somber tale mixing both Science Fiction animation & real life drama.The setting is a forest in Spain during World War 2. A troop of soldiers led by a very sadistic Captain (Serge Lopez is superb in this role.) His pregnant wife is about to deliver a child, where-in lies the rest of the storyAlso he has a 11 year old step-daughter enchantingly portrayed by Ariadna Gil, who finds a magical land in the forest, She also finds a faun (enacted by Doug Jones--he also portrays another character later on in the film). I cannot divulge more about these scenes. Add to the mix a housekeeper played by Ivana Baquerro,who is in sympathy with both Carmen & with the rebels.ALL 3 should have been nominated for Oscars.The writer/director Guiillermo Del Toro was nominated.It was a shame the Hollywood could not pick a NON_ENGLISH film as one of the top 5 of the year.Very rarely has Hollywood done this. PAN'S LABRYNTH is way superior to the 2 past films nominated GRAND ILLUSION & Z.I do not this there were any other non-English films nominated for outstanding film.Granted there is a separate award for these movies & are eligible for all other Oscars & have been nominated & won many times. BUT they do not get nominated or win the big one.NOTE: This is a harrowing grim movie,It definitely is not for children under 13-14 years old. Besides being too mature there is little action or humour in this film.It is rather for adults who enjoy superb drama mixed with some science -ficton.. These two elements blend perfectly.The acting by all is superb, the production credits are excellent.Ratings **** (out of 4) 99 points (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out if 10)",10,3,6,16 May 2007
Knocked Up," A crazy comedy for todays generation
","Judd Apatow both wrote & directed this comedic romp,.Now as much as I enjoyed much of the goings on, I would have much preferred it if there was a fewer jokes on passing of gas and many less uses of the 'f' & other choice words.The best performances were by the guys. Seth Rogan as a slightly chubby romeo was a delight. His 4 stoner buddies were near pitch perfect. & Paul Rudd as a sad sack husband & father was as usual well cast.He has a fine sense of comedic timing,. Harold Ramis is excellent in his 2 scenes as Seth's Father.Now the distaff side does not come over as well, The 2 leading ladies are beautiful & have comic ability. Leslie Mann & Katherine Heigl act like spoiled brats & do not come across as one bit likable.If there were more scenes with the guys, this easily would have been a higher rating, I would not have minded the language as much,Call me a 'fuddy-duddy ', I just do not like to hear women cursing,when there is no reason to.This is an R rated movie deservedly so,.Ratings *** (out of 4) 86 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)",8,2,4,16 November 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," almost a10 rating, reason somewhere below
","Richard Zanuck produced this film, he is the son of the legendary Darryl F Zanuck who produced great musicals at 20th Century Fox. This was Richard's first musical.Tim Burton directed,in his usual grand guignol style, that he is famous for.This film is the film adaptation of Steven Sondheim's hit Broadway play,with a well written screenplay by John Logan.The cast is all first rate & they use there own singing voices (for good or bad). Johnny Depp is pitch perfect as Sweeney Helen Bonham Carter was excellent as Mrs.Lovett Sascha Baron Cohen is wonderful as a rival barber. Ed Sanders as a 14 yr old lad who is crucial to the story. James Campbel Bower as the young lover. Jane Wisener as the required young love interest Timothy Spall as the Beadle--almost villainous. AND Alan Rickman as the dreaded villainous cruel judge The sets are excellent &^ deserved its Oscar. The cinematography for most of film is a version of black & white. this fits perfectly with the dark mood of the film.NOW for the reason of only a 9 rating. THE ENDINGThw final climatic scenes are far too bloody, unnecessary & unneeded.This is probably why it did not get more year end awards & did not do the business it should have & deserved.Also even tho I liked the music & lyrics there was not one tune that could stand alone, this is a fault of many musicals.Ratings ***1/2 (out of 4) 94 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)",9,0,2,2 April 2008
Closer," A huge disappointment
","This film came out in late 2004, It was nominated for many awards it did win a few. This also has an over 75 % approval rating on IMDb. I cannot figure out why,I was bored. I finally saw this last night,I wasted my time.This also was based on a 4 character play. It may have worked better on the stage. Both take place over a 4 or 5 year time period. You had to play close attention to the dialog in the movie to tell that a scene is much later date; the 4 actors hardly change throughout the slow running time.The 4 characters,do nothing but talk about their sexual relationships with each other. There are no scenes of them doing anything actually sexual. There is one scene in a sex bar where one of them is in a private room dancing for one of the guys. I did not think it was one bit sexually exciting,in fact it was boring.I have yet to mention the cast & director.Mike Nichols one of Hollywood & the stage's most noted & honoured directors is at the helm. He must have been doing something else as he was not paying proper attention too his cast.Four very prominent & top draw actors assay the 4 characters.Julia Roberts,Jude Law, Natalie Portman & Clive Owen. Each is quite competent in their roles, However more is needed to make the audience stay awake & enjoy what they say & do, They do nothing but talk & argue about there sexual relationships with each other, in very explicit terms.This is a very long boring film.Nice locations & sets, good music score but that is about all.Ratings: ** (out of 4) 58 points (out of 100) IMDb 5 (out of 10)",5,1,2,14 October 2009
Capote," How Truman Capote wrote IN COLD BLOOD
","This is not a full biography of the very flamboyant authors life,rather it tells of the 6 years it took him to write the story of 2 young men who killed an entire family in Kansas. in 1959.Capote was a reporter for the New Yorker magazine & thought there may have been a human interest story.The film concentrates on the relationship with one of the killers, & the devastating affect it had om Capote's life. The film is well written directed & well made.The most important reason to see this film is because of the actor PHILIP SEYMOUR Hoffman who not only portrays him, HE BECOMES HIM.I am not the only one predicting the following.Next March at the Kodak Theatre Mr Hoffman will receive the Oscar as outstanding male actor.There are no ifs ands or buts on this, He is that great.It may also get other nominations as well.My only gripe is one I have in many new films, that is the sound, I & most others had trouble in making out some dialogue when the actors spoke very low. They use this Dolby sound system forgetting that most people do not have perfect hearing.If you wish to see a superb performance see this, OH it has an R rating, I do not see why, There was no nudity, no sex, you do see some fairly fast pictures of the murder scene (in black & white), hardly any objectionable language, This should have been at most a PG 13 film.my rating is *** 1/2 (0ut of 4*) 95 points (out of 100) IMDb 9",9,10,18,1 October 2005
Ocean's Thirteen," an unfunny mess
","When the original Oceans11 was made 45 some years back. It had BIG name stars, Both they & Las Vegas hotels & are were prominently featured.When they remade this a few years back & in Oceans 12, You did have the same feeling. NOW however in this mess called Oceans 13, I did not recognize Las Vegas at all.No scene in the entire film lasted more than seconds (so it seemed),---The entire movie went at such a fast pace, you did not know where you were & what was happening.I really did not care either. The frenetic pacing destroyed what ever enjoyment was to be had..I mentioned the original film above. I can remember scenes from that movie. (last seen about 4 years ago). I cannot remember one clear scene from the mess I saw last night..Besides the bad film editing, the direction was lacking as well.It was as if the actors were doing as they pleased.If this was supposed to be a comedy,How come there was nothing to laugh about.Brad Pitt, Gearge Cloone & Matt Damon are the main stars BUT most scenes were either long or medium shots very few close ups, as if they were ashamed to be recognized. The others were barley recognizable. The old Warner Bros, films used to show the audience who was who, before the movie started, I wish they did that againNOTE this practice was only in the early 1930's/I just remembered that Al Pacino was in the cast as well. He did not over act here. Well no one was really acting anyway.Ratings ** (out of 4) 54 points (out of 100) IMDb 5 (out of 10",5,1,1,15 November 2007

","This cutting,biting satirical look at the New York Fashion industry & the people in it is a pure comic delight.Granted some of the scenes & story manipulations are a bit hard to accept. I just sat back, laughed & enjoyed myself, SO WILL YOU.Meryl Streep One of Hollywood's best dramatic actresses & also one of the best comic actresses is just perfect as the acid tongued fashion editor. What a witch (there should be a- b & not a- w in the word).Anne Hathaway (Ella Enchanted) is still enchanting us in her portrayal of Andy our hapless assistant. Emily Blunt is wonderful as the other assistant. Stanly Tucci, & Simon Baker are perfect in there roles as well. Ensemble acting wise this film ranks very high. Production values are top notch all the way, especially the scenes in Paris. Adrien Grenier (Entourage) is quite good as Andys boy friend.

The Bourne Ultimatum," a 2 hour film over 80 % action scenes
","This film is only BASED on Robert Ludlum's third part of his trilogy. It is nearly all chase scenes in many cities around the world.The acting is OK, BUT whats missing is the character development of Jason (we find out his real name towards the end of the film..For some reason only known to the writers, They killed off Jason's wife (Bourne Conspiracy).In the books, she was a vital important character & aide. Now we only have Jason & those against him.Matt Damon does quite well as Jason,It however is not the same Jason.The production credits are all first rate,BUT I wish they can hold the hand help cameras better.The editing is overly fast & furious,no scene lasts more than a few seconds,even the fantastic chase scene in Tangiers must have had about 50 different set ups.If my rating seems too high, its just that I did enjoy the movie, I just was hoping it would be betterThere will be a part 4 this ends in s partial cliffhanger.There is another book THE BOURNE LEGACY which is an excellent conclusion. I hope the film MOST of the book & tell all the facts of this interesting character, & SPOILER ALERTWe meet this fascinating assassin who just may be related to Jason.

I was awed by the legend back then & since have relished every story since. I just do not understand either the rave reviews or the roasts.. Granted this is not a great film, even with Ben Kingley & Colin Firth in the lead roles., It is an adventure story using the sword Excalibur as its basis.. It is told from the viewpoint of a 12 year old, Thomas Sangster (the last of the Ceasars). He is very presentable in the role. Ben Kingsley is supposedly Merlin.We find out hoe this magical sword became THE SWORD IN THE STONE.We even see Stonehenge at its very star.The acting is good for an adventure story & the other credits are what you would expect.I am sticking by my ratings, I liked it & hope you will as wellRatings *** (out of 4) 83 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)",7,1,4,9 January 2008
Watchmen," Same director did last years hit film '300' this is even better.
","I did not know of the graphic novel by Alan Moore & Dave Gibbons,thusly never read any of it.As many know I am not a huge fan of 'sci-fi'movies. Then why you may ask that I am giving this a rating of 10.To me the answer is simple,I like to be entertained when I watch a film. I was hypnotized, mesmerized & enthralled at the vivid imaginings created. The DVD is the extended directors cut, it runs a very smooth fast 162 minutes.David Hayter & Alex Tse fashioned a remarkable script under the brilliant direction of ZACK SNYDER (last year he made the excellent film '300'.Watchmen is a much more involved story, we are in an alternate universe (for example Nixon is serving his 5th term in the White House)(year is 1985 by the way.)We may or may not agree with some of the political type statements,we just must remember that this is fantasy & science fiction.so sit back & just enjoy. Thankfully there are no big name recognizable stars,we can just] pay close attention to the story & not a well known body or face.The large cast includes Billy Crudup,Carla Gugino, Patrick Wilson,Malin Akerman & Jackie Earl Haley, They & the rest of cast are ALL excellent.There are many superb special effects (CGI), excellent make-up,art & set decoration, cinematography, etc.The editing is tight, much happens but it is easy to follow.Music score is top draw & a very good song score.The film was made mostly in the Vancouver are.The last 'sci-fi' movies that impressed me so much wasTHE MATRIX & that was on my 10 best list of the year. WATCHMEN will be a leading candidate for this years list.The rating is a very just R. this is a very adult film not for small children, parents should see it first.Ratings: **** (out of 4) 97points (out of 100) IMDb 10 (out of 10)",10,2,5,22 July 2009

21," Have we not seen this film before?
","The answer to my question is yes. This particular effort was first a non-fiction novel by Ben Mezrich telling us about 6 very bright,but stupid MIT students & there somewhat slimy professor who robbed Las Vegas Blackjack tables for millions. Peter Steinfeld and Allen Loeb wrote the screenplay. The director is Robert Luketic.I wonder how much research these film creators made.The film in inaccurate in the portrayals of the Las Vegas Casino operations,Las Vegas itself,MIT the school these students are from & a few other things.All these inaccuracies could be tolerated in a film that was interesting and fun to watch. Even the original Ocean's Eleven, in all the Rat Pack's foolishness,Studio sets etc seemed more real.Now OCEANS 11 & its sequels had real professional actors doing these roles & made us accept all the inaccuracies as fun.The performers in 21, have looks & some talent and that is about all. Jim Sturgess is the lead actor, He may eventually be a good actor. Kate Bosworth is the requisite female & yes the 2 of them do have a mild role in the hay. The other 4 student are OK.NONE of them standout. Kevin Spacey is the slimy teacher, he used to give great performances What happened. Laurence Fishburn (the most talented actor in the cast) is wasted,This film was made on location in Boston & Las Vegas areas,the sets look good & thats about it, also none of the song score was done live, NOTE the do have live entertainment in casinos, but not in this film.The running time is 124 very long,very boring minutes,thus my ** (unsatisfactory) rating.ratings ** (out of 4) 58 points(out of 100) IMDb (5 out of 10)",5,0,1,10 September 2008

Little Miss Sunshine," A very good B movie NOT worthy of any Oscar nominations
","Yes dear readers this film is quite good for a minor Independent film. BUT is not for consideration of Best Picture or any Oscar nominations.This tale of a very dysfunctional family & there trip from New Mexico to Southern California to enter a very cute child in the MISS SUNSHINE beauty contest is not really for the entire family. A certain 4 letter word is uttered many times mainly by Alan Arkin, He probably got his Oscar nomination because he is elderly & older people do not use such language usually.The cute little girl Abiigal Breslin also was nominated, There must have been another actress worthy of this nomination. It received other nominations as well. WHY I DO NOT UNDERSTAND>.The acting is worthy of its casts talent, Greg Kennear ^ Toni Colette are the parents, Also Steve Carell & Paul Dano are excellent.Mr.Carell is wonderful as a very quiet man. & Paul Dano as an unhappy teen is great,There are many fun bits,, the production is first rate,They are traveling throughout the southwest & the area is absolutely fantastically beautiful.

Knowing," I ignored the ridiculous story as I do not take Sci-Fi films seriously.
","Alex Proyas capably directed this not very good screenplay by Ryce Douglas Pearson & Juliet Snowden.Since I also am not a Sci-Fi devotee nor am a believer in the apocalypse,I ignored the unbelievable script, sat back & liked the goings on.

The director does crown scenes very well.Now even though the action is supposed to be in the Boston area, nearly the entire film was made in Australia.Nicolas Cage is the lead & he does his usual proficient job. he is the only well known actor in the film.Rose Byrne is main female in the cast & is good.Two nine year old children are prominently cast. Chandler Canterbury is excellent as Nic's son. Lara Robinson also same age has a double role.If you enjoy ridiculous Sci-Fi you may like it better than I.

The Orphanage," Finally a horror type film without gore or bloody violence.
","My summary is accurate BUT not how I really should describe this excellent drama.Guilleremo Del Toro the producer/director of Pan's Labrynth is the producer of THE ORPHANAGE, but I am sure he was looking over this film like a legendary producer of the past( David O.Selznick)used to do.The directorial reigns were handed to first time director Juan Berona. Mr. Berona did an excellent job for his first full feature .Setting is a very large old house which was at one time an orphanage.It just happens to be the new home of a nice married couple & there adorable 7 year old son. It turns out that said wife grew up in this place & has happy memories (we do see her last day as a child here in the opening scene. The young 7 year old seems to have imaginary friends that he finds in this house.. A while later at a party the lad just seems to have disappeared. The rest of the film is about the mothers search for her missing son amongst other things in her once happy secure life.Belon Rueda is the fine Spanish actress who portrays this women. I personally feel she was cheated out of an Oscar nomination for her superb performance. The entire cast is excellent as well. Geraldine Chaplin has a brief role & is excellent.As I said in my summary (above) there is next to no violence & no bloody gore or zombies like you find in other generic horror films.At times this film is very spooky & even scary, & there was a point I said out loud 'dont go down the stairs''All the production credits are first rate.Many of the craft technicians were first times like the director. Obviously the producer Mr.Del Toro supervised in fine fashion. ( ala the legendary Selznick--for those who do not know he produced Gone With The Wind & Duel in the Sun---2 classic movies.)I do not recommend this for small children or for those who want gore & more gore.Ratings **** (out of 4) 98 points (out of 100) IMDb 10 (out of 10)",10,2,6,25 April 2008
Wanted," another comic book made into a movie
","First there was a comic book series by Mark Miller,& JC Jones, then a story written by Micheal Brandt & Derek Hass, then these 2 along with Chris Morgan devised this imaginative screenplay which was probably inspired by THE MATRIX which was the Wachowski Brothers inspiration & we know what a treat that was.We now have a Russian film director Timur Beckmambetov making his first English language film. He seems to be a very gifted director as it is obvious from scene one that this is a comic book & all credibility & reason must be suspended for the next 105 minutes (10 minutes of credits follow),.Watching this last night I was amazed that I liked this so much. I am a Senior Citizen & we are not supposed to enjoy these action packed thrill rides. I thoroughly enjoyed this crazy impossible to believe goings on.The Cast is headed by James McAvoy who is besides being very handsome & a fine actor proves he can do an action picture, He is ably assisted by Morgan Freeman, who is always good,Angelina Jolie is more than eye candy here.Terrance Stamp who still is darn good looking has a nice role as well as Thomas Kretschman (The Pianist) is as usual excellent.the rest of the cast are basically unknowns but all arr very good. I must mention one actress though Lorna Scott (as Janice) gives in a few short scenes a performance that hopefully will get her more roles.Being an action film, There are many special effects,Thanks to CGIimpossible stunts are devised. There is one that I must mention, a Train Wreck on a bridge high above a STEEP ravine that is beyond belief.There are many scenes where we must suspend our beliefs & just sit back & enjoy.IT IS A COMIC BOOK COME TO LIFE.Ratings: *** out of 4 --- 88 points out of 100---IMDB--8 out of 10",8,0,2,3 December 2008
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," mild thumbs up--could have been better
","This film contrary to both the overly positive & negative reviews is neither that good nor bad.This is a satiric,comedic,yet dramatic spoof of the rock music industry.The music is great, There just was not enough of it. John C.Reilly gives a very energetic portrayal of Dewey Cox a fictional combo of many singers of the last 40 years,The writers have used every cliché we associate with biographies,to almost real good effect.My praise is tempered because they resort to near slapstick & physical humour, which I never have cared for.As I said above, the music & songs are first rate & John C.Reilly has a pleasant enough voice to do them justice.The production credits are first rate & the acting by a large cast with good imitations of some of the greats in the music IndustryThis is not a film for the youngsters due to the drug taking by many.My rating is a mild thumbs up I wish it were a rave notice though.Ratings: *** (out of 4) 81 points (out of 7) IMDb 7 (out of 10)",7,0,1,10 April 2008
Disturbia," An excellent revamping of Hitchcock's Rear Window
","Dear readers & fellow film buffs, MY summary is correct.In 1954 The great Alfred Hitchcock took Cornell Woolrich's short story & had it written as a film to fit its stars, James Stewart, Grace Kelly,Thelma Ritter & Raymond Burr as the Killer. I never though his version was as good as the original short story. MY IMDb rating was only a 7.You can see my rating above for this delight, it may not be as suspenseful as Hitch's version,BUT the sets, costumes, makeup & the camera angles are nowhere as phony as the 1954 version. (that is the way they made movies back then--every hair & make up just perfect at all times, all clothes brand new looking.)Thankfully now-a-days there is more realism in costumes, make up etc., by being more realistic in the set ups & the naturalness of the performers, we can accept much easier, the unbelievability of the plot & story & sit back & enjoy our selves, in the same manner I did when I first read the short suspenseful story,D.J.Carson directed Carl Ellsworths story & screenplay of Woolrich's.gem of a short story.Instead of James Stewarts broken leg, we have hapless teen-ager SHIA LA BEOUF in his first starring adult role. This lad will have a LONG very LONG career. He is under HOUSE ARREST with that bracelet around his ankle.. He is bored , upset (for very good reasons).I will not tell you, it is an upsetting reason. &because of this, you are on his side rooting for him all the way. Personally I would have no objection if it went as far as an Oscar Nomintion HE IS THAT GOOD>. Sarah Rohmer is is enjoyable as his possible future girl friend. Carrie-Anne Moss is excellent as his mother. Aaron Yoo is a delight as his buddy. & David MORSE is perfect as the villain, he is every bit as spooky & nasty as Raymond Burr was in Rear Window.If there are faults in DISTURBIA I overlooked them & I feel you will as well..There are few gross scenes so film is not for the small fry.

The Patriot," first rate action packed drama
","Against the back drop of the American  Revolutionary War, we follow the adventures of one family in South Carolina during the war. Typical story  well written  by  Robert Rodat  & superb performances by Mel Gibson as a widowed father with seven children to bring up & protect in these bad times,  Heath Ledger is his oldest son.This young man will become a star, he is that good an actor. The action scenes are brief  & very brutal, BUT not overdone (as lets say if it were  made by Steven Speilberg), the director Roland Emmerich has the proper attitude in  showing violent scenes. He does not linger on open wounds like the above Mr.S, did in Saving Pvt Ryan. This story is fiction as I do not believe the historical characters behaved in the way they were portrayed here. BUT  this is still a  worth while film to see as a family drama & not a history lesson my rating  is a low   ***1/2 as alwaysjay harris",8,2,3,19 May 2001

","This is based on the  film for the 1960`s with  Frank Sinatra & all his friends, It was a pleasant diversion, The current film is  much better. A family film if there ever was one. No sex or nudity, hardly any objectional words, I heard Damm once, The violence was brief & very mild. The acting by   George Clooney &  Brad Pitt & all the others was first rate, excellent music score also.\ This story of  robbing  3 Las Vegas casinos is well written, The only gripe I have is that the last scene is a letdown.

Enchanted," a typically, delightful fantasy from Disney
","Enchanted is a good, delightful fantasy from the studio that has made many such films.The story, is what you would expect It is half real life & half animated, very silly at times,It is also romantic in the old fashioned manner. ( Very chaste & Vanilla).There are a few good songs, 3 of them were nominated for an Oscar. To its credit they were done LIVE, I wish all songs were done live in films, like they used to be, Years back they always had a scene in a night club or bar, where the star or featured performer sang. (that is when it was not an actual musical comedy).The acting in ENCHANTED is good, Amy Adams is our heroine, Patrick Dempsey is our real life hero, James Marsdden is our fairy tale hero, brought to life. Susan Sarandin is th evil witch, Timothy Spall is our comic relief. two other performers I must mention,Patrick Dempse has a cute daughter, & little Rachel Covey is this typically delightful Disney moppet,Idina Menzel is Dempsey's fiancé, I know I want to see more of this actress.The film has a proper PG rating,Many Disney movies should have been rated PG,some of the older ones had at least one scary scene. The running time of 103 minutes is about 15 minutes too long, It has a tendency to drag in spots, Overall, it is a good BUT not great family funRatings *** out of 4: 86 out of 100 points: IMDb 8 out of 10",8,0,1,18 March 2008
Quantum of Solace," What an utter disappointment
","I normally have liked the Jams Bond film,They were a fun view. This overloaded special effect film was nothing more than car chases & explosions,fights,torture and other forms of mayhem with less than 30 minutes of story.Special effects are usually very thrilling and exciting,BUT when they are over done, You cannot remember any of them. Previous films in this franchise had a Great beginning & ending,the rest of film had an exciting interesting story line.Here we begin with a song, Perhaps the worst example of a song imaginable. Bad voices, disgusting lyrics.Then we have a meaningless car chase over a mountain. This sense has been used is far too many films & now is boring.Daniel Craig is Bond,He is too good an actor for this junk.The villain reminded me of Roman Polanski in Chinatown. The man was not as mean or nasty as Roman was. There are the usual sexy required females, this time played by persons I know not of.I will not even mention their names or the directors name.The only decent performance was by Jeffrey Wright & he was only in one scene for less than 2 minutes. There was no other recognizable name except for Judi Dench as M another waste of a fine actress.The only reason this has a rating of 3 is that the cinematography & settings are good,. BUT why go to all these locations & then use CGI effects.This film is a pure waste of money & the audiences time.Ratings: *1/2* (out of 4) 42 points(out of 100) IMDb 3 (out of 10_",3,3,6,25 March 2009
The Butterfly Effect," a real surprise
","I saw this intriguing film last night & was quite amaze at how much I enjoyed it.The lead actor Ashton Kutcher, has made a name or himself on a Television show & a few films in comedic roles.In THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT, he gives a superb dramatic turn, I can foresee a big future for this young actor. Very few actors have excelled in both comedies & dramas. To name only 2, GLENN FORD & JACK LEMMON.The female lead is played by Amy Smart, this is a multi part performance & she too is excellent. I have heard her name but cant place her in any film, Mark my word,We will see much more of her,The rest of the cast are actors I did not recognize excerpt fort Eric Stolz, who plays Amy's father, The all are excellent.The entire production is first rate all the way through.This is a very complicated story of imagination, some real events & pure fantasy.The last film of this type that impressed me this much was DONNIE DARKO. In fact both films would make a fantastic double bill,BUT it would be hard to sleep the night you saw both.Like Donnie Darko, this is psychedelic fantasy, science fiction,horror story. This type film is rare & very hard to succeed.The Butterfly Effect succeeds on all counts.rating ***1/2 /4 points 90/100 IMDb 8",8,162,245,9 January 2005
No Country for Old Men," There will be spoilers in this review.
","My rating of 7 is only a good movie in my scoring system & in this film, the cinematography, art direction settings & costume are excellent. I cant put music down as there is next to no score. The editing is very good as well.What is missing then, there is no story,what we have here is a 2 hour synopsis, There is no character development for any of the myriad persons..I am glad it was closed captioned as they all spoke so softly, you could barley here the sparse dialog.Javier Bardem deserved his nomination, BUT I just don't think he deserved an Oscar for it. In fact the film deserved none of the Oscars it won.Normally I hate to give out spoilers, here are thye main ones.Bardem is the killer as we all know, BUT he walks away wounded but alive at the ending. Tommy Lee Jones is the only other major cast member left alive.I saw this as a rental from NETFLIX, (my average cost per film is about one dollar. In other words, dear reader, the film is worth a cheap rental fee ONLY.This is not the worst Coen Brother movie,It is however very disappointing.

Mamma Mia!," a pure joyous romp, with songs by ABBA & Meryl Streep
","MAMMA MIA! is a pure cinematic joyous romp.Phylinda Lloyd directed this, she also directed the stage musical.Catherine Johnson wrote the screenplay & the musical book for the stage musical.The songs are all based on the music of ABBA, The 1970'S great musical group from Sweden. I will admit to liking the music of ABBA very much mainly because we can understand the lyrics.The large cast is mostly made up of actors not known for their singing. Here it does not matter if you really can sing,The music & lyrics are so joyous & happy, we all can sing along.The entire cast has an absolute field day. Before I get to the cast a note on the plot & story.This delightful tale is quite reminiscent of the marvelous 1968 comedy' Buono Sera Mrs, Campbell starring Gina Lollobrigida..Mamma Mia stars Meryl Streep. She should have have been nominated for her spirited performance.(as well as her role in Doubt,) What a performer. Pierce Brosnam, Colin Firth & Stellan Skarsgard co-star as her 3 suitors. they all are very good. Amanda Seyfried plays her daughter ,this young lady will have a big career ahead of her.Her swain is played by up & coming Dominic Cooper another young actor with great talent. Julie Waters & Christine Baranski are Meryl's buddy from her past. they are excellentThis film was made mostly in Greece, Beautiful scenery & setting add to the magic.This is definitely one of the best films of 2008.A MUST see musical for seekers of a good time. I will buy the DVD of this because I will want to see it again & then one more time. It is that enjoyable.",10,0,2,17 February 2009
Twilight," Review from a SENIOR citizen
","I just wonder how many other Seniors loved this like I did.As I have stated in other reviews & comments I enjoy movies more, when they have nice people in them. I did not read Stephanie Meyer's novel. The screenplay was written by Melissa Rosenberg & Catherine Hardwick directed.I think they did a good job.Twilight is a teen aged romance set in a small town. The teen & all the rest of the cast are real nice people, The villains are not overly nasty even.The cast is mostly newcomers at least to me. Kirsten Stewart & Robert Pattinson are 2 teens, Robert just happens to be a vampire. These 'two 17 year 'olds' fall in love. They really are very sweet & do come across.Billy Burke plays Emma's father & Peter Facinelli is the Vampire who created Robert many years back.There is no real violence till the last few scenes,& the violence is slightly muted.The film has a proper PG rating, it is a movie' for the entire family.Eagerly waiting for the next film.Ratings: *** (out of 4) 86 points(out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)",8,1,6,21 March 2009

Revolutionary Road," well made BUT not very believable
","Revolutionary Road was directed by Sam Mendes from a screenplay by Justin Haythe,& from the novel by Richard Yates. Time period is 1950's. Its about suburban life & the unhappy marriage of 2 attractive people with 2 attractive children.Leonrdo Dicaprio & Kate Winslet portray this unhappy couple.A BIT OF personal history here. In the 1950's I was just a few years younger than this couple & also lived in a middle size city.I cannot remember any persons in my age group back then acting like this couple did. Granted some did not have happy lives BUT none were this miserable. I remember that era as being a glorious time to live & raise a family..Yes we smoked & drank a lot BUT not to the extent this couple did.In the film Micheal Shannon plays a neighbours adult son, just released from a mental hospital. To me he was the sanest person in the cast,He just was ahead of his time speaking out on subjects.The acting by Kate & Leo is good. They just were not a likable couple especially Kate Winslet's April. She was a selfish, controlling b****, What she does at conclusion, made me lose whatever remaining respect I may have had for. Leonardo Dicaprio's, Frank, also was not someone I would have wanted as a friend, I would even have trouble consoling him at the end of the film.Now for what I did like in the film. they did recreate the period as far as settings, costumes etc. Aside from Micheal Shannon's performance, I must comment Zoe Kazan (Elia Kazan's granddaughter) he is the young secretary that Frank has an affair with. There were so many cigarettes consumed,I hope no one gets sick from watching the movie.Ratings: **1/2 (out of 4) 73 points (out of 100) IMDb 6 (out of 10)",6,1,3,3 June 2009
2012," A disaster film with a great sense of humor.
","Roland Emmerich has created a comic gem in 2012. He not only directed, he co-wrote it, with Harold Closer,He was (as all good directors are) very much involved in the music & editing as well as the special effects.He fully realized that even tho the subject matter (global warming will eventually destroy us); a careful rational screenplay would not satisfy the the demands of an audience raised on special effects. He did create a screenplay full of humor & still had awesome special effects depicting the end of the world as we know it.There have been a few films over the years about an ensuing apocalypse, Most of them were plain stupid, & utterly without any feeling of enjoyment.NOTE: A DISASTER SPECIAL EFFECT LADEN FILM IS SUPPOSED TO BE FUN.We cannot take this type movie seriously.What you need is a cast of some familiar faces, some new faces and who are for the most part all likable people. PLUS one standout role.(preferably near the beginning of film).Woody Harrelson fits this role to a T. His role is a gem & it sets the the tone, of not taking the re of the film too seriously.I for one was able to sit back & enjoy myself,I knew many of these nice people (in the cast & some others) would survive & the world would be saved.The spirited, well acted & defined cast stars John Cusack & he is ably supported by Chiwetel Ejiofor, Thandie Newton,Oliver Platt, Amanda Peet,& Danny Glover, among others.The special effects are fantastic, as one would expect.The running time is a FAST 158 minutes., On the DVD there are a few good extras as well.

This had no one to root for in the first 20 minutes.I like Hillary Swank & Gerald Butler, but here they were miscast.Miss Swank should never attempt silly comedy again.Kathy Bates an actress I am very fond of was not up to her usual par.Neither was anyone else.In the 20 minutes I saw, there ere at least 5 songs including one one by Judy Garland.Ratings: 1 1/2* (out of 4) points 48 (out of 100) IMDM 4 (out of 10)",4,2,6,8 May 2008

Gran Torino," Another minority opinion from me
","If you combined the very worst qualities of Archie Bunker and Al Bundy, he still would be a better person than Walt Kowalsky.That is how I feel about Clint Eastward's character in Gran Torino.Clint portrays a bigot without one real likable characteristic.If this were a comedy like 'All In The Family' or 'Married With Children', I could have at least had a few laughs. GRAN TORINO purports to be a serious drama.What this film has is about every cliché imaginable. including this one.SPOILER ALERTIn the tradition of older Warner Bothers films where the star dies a a martyr's death,he is spread out on the lawn as if crucified.This however is not the ending one,more clichés follow & many before.Scenes in this movie have been done so many times over the years,it almost is a comedy.Clint does his usual fine direction in the awful script. The acting by mostly actors from Television or in debut performances are all what you expect. The production credits are good as well.Bee Vang is quite good in his first role as the put upon teen ager. Christopher Corley in his first major film role is the kindly likable priest, Combine Pat O'Brien & Bing Crosby priestly roles. He is the only really likable character besides Bee's Thao.There are nasty villains. we have seen them too many times by now.Now one more thing, Whats the deal with this auto. I never was able to figure out peoples desires and love for cars. Yes, when I drove I liked & took good care of my cars, They were expensive even then so you were supposed to take good care of them.BIG DEAL.In closing, I now can see why this movie was so overlooked during award season, It deserved NONE.Ratings: ** (out of 4) 64 points (out of 100) IMDb 5 (out of 10)",5,9,19,10 June 2009

","Shrek 1 & Shrek 2 were both thoroughly enjoyable.I had expected this one to be enjoyable as well.I WAS VASTLY DISAPPOINTED..In fact I did not even laugh or feel any enjoyment watching this movie. It was not funny at all.There were too many fairy tale characters here, many of whom I vastly enjoyed years ago, They did nothing here but waste my time.The song score was pitiful, as you only heard next to no lyrics.. Many talented actors lent there voices for the various characters,BUT I did not know who was doing who until the credits at the end of film..The so-called script made insulting fun of beloved fairy tale characters. We have Snow White WITHOUT THE DRWARFS, for example.The legend of King Arthur was unfairly spoofed, especially since Julie Andrews (CAMELOT) was one of the voices..Technically the animation was great,If they make part I do hope it is better than this .RATINGS ** (out of 4) 55 points (out of 60) IMDb 5 (out of 10)",5,0,1,15 November 2007

Mark Boals screenplay is a spare one, & is excellent. Our 3 main soldiers are portrayed by featured actors from film & TV. I am sure they will be in major roles from here on. Jeremy Renner,Anthony Mackie & Brian Geraghty are first rate.Ralph Fiennes,David Morse & Guy Pierce have cameo roles/ Evangeline Lilly is the only female cast member,Her role is very brief.Most of the cinematography is by hand held camera, I usually bitch about it, BUT here it is needed. It heightens the suspense is many scenes & very well done.The editing is almost flawless.Now being about G.I.'s the language is quite raw BUT it fits the scenes. This was made mostly in Jordan;.This is definitely one of the years best.

","This romantic hogwash runs 131 overlong minutes. This is mainly due to a song score that besides being too long is not very good.Compounding this there are way too many scenes in slow-motion. As most of you know, this is the second of Stephanie Meyers trilogy, about s teen age girl pursues 2 vampires.This episode has werewolves as well. Special effects just so-so.Chris Weitz directed this & Melissa Rosenburg did the screenplay.Our trio is Kristen Stewart as the smitten teen, Robert Pattinson as the pale vampire & Tayler Lautner as the tanned hunky one.

The Illusionist," First rate all the way
","This is a period film, set in Austria in the late 1880's..Thusly, It is rich in settings, costumes, cinematography,Music,then complimented by superior acting, from the likes of Edward Norton,Paul Giamatti, Jessica Biel & Rufus Sewell.Neil Burger's excellent direction makes this romantic drama & political intrigue very worthwhile viewing.My only gripe is I felt the ending was a bit confusing.Edw. Norton is the Illusionist a stage performer traveling in Austria, Paul Giamatti is a policeman trying to prove him a fake. Rufus Sewell is the Crown Prince {***SPOILER ALERT }(of Mayerling fame). As usual he is quite good, & the lovely Jessica Biel is the fair lady, Who Edw.Norton may just take away from the Crown Prince,.

Transformers," If you like computer generated images(CGI) you will love this,
","The running time of this long film is 143 minutes,including 8 minutes of credits, approx. 20 minutes of story exposition & the remaining (almost 2 hours) is special effects.At least that is what it seemed like to me.Apparently there was an animated version made in the 1980's (I never saw it. This fact I did not know or remember until I read it on IMDb.As I was watching the movie, I was thinking,it would have been better if it was an animated film.Shia LeBeouf is our young hero & he is great, I raved about him a few weeks back in DISTURBIA... This lad will become a big star..The only other name actors in the film are Jon Voight & John Turturro. They give there usual clichéd performances. Jon Voight used to be a darn good looking & talented actor, WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.As usual in these type films our hero must have a girl friend involved. This time is Megan Fox.(no comment on her talent).The special effects are first rate,more than likely it will win the special effect Oscar.The script is very juvenile & the director Micheal Bay knows how to use the Blue Screen to its best advantage.ratings *** (out of 4) 81 points (out of 10) IMBB 7 (out of 10)",7,0,2,25 October 2007
Wimbledon," charming, delightful, The way they used to make films.
","First let me state I am not a fan of Tennis, in fact I could care less about the game or its players.I am,however a fan of the Male Star of this film. PAUL BETTANY.Every time I have seen his films, he always portrays a different character, this time in a romantic comedy.He portrays a Tennis player ranked 119th, (not a good ranking anywhere), He is invited to play in Wimbledon tennis tournament.& in same tournament he meets the beautiful, vivacious Kirsten Dunst, a renowned player in the US.Now of course, when 2 beautiful people meet, you can bet there will be romance. A pre-ordained story form year one at the cinema.What raises this film much, much higher is the complete likability of every character, even Sam Neil as Kirsten's overly protective father.Our young hero comes from a well-to-do family of delightful eccentrics.This charmer is very reminiscent of delightful comedies or the '40's & '50's. Even the now required sex scene between Paul & Kirsten would have passed muster back then.The Tennis action seems real (not being a fan) I cant say for sure.I highly recommend this film for all.IMDb rating 9 out of 10 Star rating 31/2 out 4 point rating 94/100My ratings may be a bit high, but so entranced by the stars & the likability of all.,& the fact they do not make this type romantic comedy any more, maybe my ratings are not high enough.

Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Pure insane enjoyment. Fun for ALL ages
","Phil Lord & Chris Beck, co-directed & co-wrote the screenplay, they adapted the book by Ron & Judi Barrett.The story is insanely silly, BUT never stupid, like some other animated feature films.Thankfully this is not a Disney or Pixar film, It is from SONY ANIMATION. SONY was previously known as Columbia & they made very few feature animated films.This film is a delight,very well edited. There is next to no Toilet humor & what there is fits the scene & is not over done or thrown at you. The characters voiced by the likes of Bill Hader.Anna Ferris, James Caan, while being typical 'cartoonish' do come across as real people,They may be silly BUT are not stupid buffoons.The song score is very good,but due to the sharp editing is truncated.

","The superb acting of  Tommy Lee Jones, Samuel L. Jackson & Guy Pierce makes this courtroom drama a MUST SEE. We all have seen this type story before, Well decorated hero goes overboard on a mission & is being court-martialed. The performance of the above 3 are so skillfully directed by William Friedkin, that we easily can overlook certain deficiencies in the story.

Children of Men," One of the best films of 2006
","This grim tale of the future was directed by Alfanso Cuaron who has directed the following excellent films.Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN and HARRY POTTER & THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN,Three entire different movies, This is a director whose films we will be watching for many years to come.The film is an adaptation of a novel by PD James and it has been changed for cinematic reasons.At the opening we learn that the last child was born 18 years ago.subsequently we find a young lady 8 months pregnant.Clive Owen is hired to transport this mother -to-be to a safe have.The rest of film is a chase & hunt story. I cannot tell you more, as I will not spoil anyones enjoyment of anticipation.Beware though, THIS IS A VIOLENT movie, & is too mature for young viewers.Most of the cast are not very well known actors except for the following.Julianne Moore has a small but vital role, even though she is second billedMicheal Caine is nearly unrecognizable in his few to many scenes.Clive Owen is the lead performer, He should become a major star soon as he is that impressionable.ALL the acting is first rate.

The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," this film is so unbelievable it is almost a comedy.
","This is the 'so-sad', so impossible to believe tale of a family living next door to a Concentration camp during World War 2. & of the strange friendship of two 8 year old boys, one the Commandants son & the other a sad eyed Jewish boy.In the late 1930's & early 1940's Hollywood made many films about Nazi Germany & Concentration camps, at that time we did not know of the extent of what was going on, SO the studios made propaganda films such as.THE MORTAL STORM, SO ENDS OUR NIGHT,ESCAPE & WATCH ON THE RHINE (just to name 4) (these are all very good movies), they were pure Hollywood fiction made on studio or back lot sets.They and all the others were more believable than this travesty.I did not believe that any of them were German,I saw English actors playing Germans etc. The 2 known stars, usually give top notch performances.David Thewlis as the commandant is not the least bit effective. Vera Farmiga as his wife is equally ineffective. The two boys played by Asa Butterfield & Jack Scanlon are cute, but seem more like todays 8 year 'olds'. The only believable role was old time actor Richard Johnson as Grandpa,he at least knew how to do his character.Mark Herman wrote the screenplay taken from a novel by John Byrne, he also directed this mess.The movie was made in Hungary,There was nothing believable about this film in any department.The ending is supposed to be tragic & sad, if so, how come I was just happy that this bore of a film was over withRatings: * (out of 4) 25 points(out of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 4)",1,32,72,15 July 2009
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," What a delightful movie.
","Tim Burton & Johnny Depp have recreated Roald Dahl children's fantasy into an absolute delight. John Augest wrote the screen play.Johnny Depp portrait of man-child Willy Wonka is another gem, He has yet to give a less than perfect performance.Freddie Highmore (the lad from Finding Neverland is a fine Charlie & David Kelly is magnificent as his grandfather. Helena Bonham Carter & Noah Taylor are his parents & as usual are very good. James Fox & a very young looking 84 yr old Christopher Lee prove once again what fine actors they are, even in a smaller role.Tim Burton's direction is is exciting as any of his other films.Now you are all saying--look at the high praise he is giving but he only gives it an 8 rating.---there has to be something the matter.Yes, dear readers there is; the film is about 25 minutes too long.Seeing various versions of the same point was somewhat boring.Now I know the film cost many millions of dollars & much of it is on the screen.

World Trade Center," The 2nd film this year on the tragedy of 9/11
","A few months ago I wrote a rave review on UNITED 93 which told of the ill-fated plane that crashed in PA instead of the White House on that fateful day 9/11. That movies WILL be on my top 10 list for 2006.This film WORLD TRADE CENTER starring Nicolas Cage will NOT be on my top 10.Oliver Stone directed this, & in the first 20 minutes or so, He created some excellent suspense & crowd scenes, He like Steven Speilburg & Cecic B.DeMille are & were the best at crown scenes,For most of the balance of the film we are buried with 2 of the trapped policemen in the rubble of an elevator shaft, waiting for rescue. We hear there thoughts & see happy moments as they remember there families & friends, Regretfully these are scenes & memories we have seen in many disaster type films, over the years.I only wish the writers conceived of a better story line, This is supposedly based on what these 2 men & there families told the writers.This may have read good on paper,but visually it was boring.Nicolas Cage is one of the 2 men,( I do not remember the other actors name, nor did I ever hear of him before). Mr. Cage is better as light comedy actor than he is in a serious drama like this film.What made UNITED 93 great(for me at least) was that it had a no-name-cast & I was sitting on the edge of my seat watching it. In this film I was almost falling asleep. Since I knew both trapped men survived there was no suspense,The various family members stories were all stock situations.The productions values especially the first 20 minutes are excellent, I only wish the balance was as good.rating **1/2 out of 4----72 points out of 100--IMDb 6 out of 10",6,0,3,1 January 2007
The Insider," One of the most disappointing films of 1999
","To put it simply & succinctly this film is a mess. The screenplay is disjointed & unless you are familiar with the original story on 60 minutes, you will have a hard time undertstanding what is going on. both Al Pacino & Russell Crowe act there hearts out & I for one found them not believable. Now my main gripe & my very low rating is for the music.One of the most aggravatingly bad scores,There are some supposed songs (you cant make out any lyrics at all), That is so annoying you wonder what is happening to  film music now a days.Also it is overly long & quite boring. The 158 minute length is way too long, An hour could have been easily cut.Respectivly submittedJay  Harris",4,1,4,2 November 2000
The Dark Knight," not really a disappointment.Just not as good many say
","Let me start this way, I have been a BATMAN fan ever since I first read issue #1 way back in 1940. There was a BATMAN 15 episode serial as well, which I sat thru each episode, each every Saturday afternoon.There were cartoon versions as well which I liked.In the 1970's there was a comic BATMAN TV series It was a hoot. There even was a film which I saw more than once.In the 1980's &'90's there were about 4 Batman films They like all the previous efforts were pure fun even stupid fun. A few years back we had the first part of the new Batman series of films It was a good film a wee bit serious but fun.NOW we have THE DARK KNIGHT. This excellently acted well thought of film is just too serious for its own good. Christopher & Jonathan Nolan fashioned a very serious screenplay & with Christoper's directing we have a sombre film.Batman films are comic books brought to the large screen they are supposed to be fun, the are not real life, The audience is supposed to feel good at the exciting antics of the heroes & villains.There is no humour in this very long action packed film. There are many special effect scenes, excellent CGI work ALL very professional.Now for the cast. Christian Bale is our sombre almost dull hero. The others in the cast overshadow him. Aaron Eckart Is an excellent Harvey Dent/Two Face. The late lamented Heath Ledger is superb as the tormented joker. When Heath left us last year The acting community lost one of the future GREATS<Gary Oldman is also very good as Lt.Gordon.Maggie Gylennhaal is OK in here role, Its a nothing much role to begin with. Most major action films, seemingly action film must have a female in it.Micheal Cain & Morgan Freeman are there usual fine selves in there roles.Cillian Murphy has a few short minutes as the scarecrow.Chin Han as some effective moments as well.The production credits are all first rate.

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," The darkest most serious & BEST Harry Potter to date
","First, let me say, I have not read any of the books in this series.ALSO: Let me state,. Film Studios have been changing Books & Plays for as long as they have been making films. There have been instances where the entire story of the book was junked & only the title and a few names were used from the original novel.I just read a few comments on what they altered here. Do these writers realize that to put all of the novel in the movie would entail an 8 hour or more film. I am also quite sure Miss Rowling approved all the changes made.Harry & the other young actors are growing up & acting more adult now. THANKKFULLY.Everyone one the cast is first rate, BUT I must single out Imelda Staunton, In her cheery disposition, she comes across as evil personified. A villianess of the first order. She deserves an Oscar nomination for her performance,.Daniel Radcliffe as Harry will become one of our better actors when he advances to more adult roles.Gary Oldman, thankfully has more to do in this chapter, I wish David Thewliss had more to do as well..

The production, IT IS EXCELLENTBeautiful cinematography,excellent settings,costumes etc.A very good song score & marvelous acting by all concernedNow the other side of the coin. It is overly long, 148 minutes is about 40 minutes too long.The lead character -Chris- is not a likable young man. He is a selfish lad who doesn't even let his parents or his sister know if he is OK. Granted the parents were dysfunctional BUT at least care enough to let them know you are OK every so often.Emile Hirsch does a superb job as Chris, I just did not care about him or that he perishes.Sean Penn, wrote & directed in his usual fine style.

Blood Diamond," One of the 10 best of 2006
","I have been a fan of action films almost of my entire long life. I watched some many times.Blood Diamond is of the same breed of movie, Instead of Burt Lancaster we have Leonardo De Caprio, slick &, charming & ever so deadly. Instead of Sidney Poitier we have Djimon Hounsou as the poor noble man looking for his wife & children & instead of Maureen O' Hara we have Jennifer Connelly as the intrepid reporter.,Granted my 3 names from the past never made a film together, But this film has all the same ingredients, Instead of a false ,phony story way back then, we have a more vital truthful story here..The villains are still the same only this time more realistically vicious.In fact the only thing missing is a free-for all barroom brawl. Thanks for small favours.All the production credits are excellent. THis is a long film 143 minutes, If I were to be picky I would state the the last 15 minutes before the credits began to roll,were very slow moving. The first 130 or so minutes moved at a rapid pace.As much as I loved the older movies of my youth,the stores they told were very juvenile on most cases. Now-a-days at least they are more realistic & honest. The story & screenplay was written by Charles Leavitt was masterly directed by Edward Zwick.

Once Upon a Time in America," One of the best films I have seen in over 70 years of film watching
","Actually this is one of the 5 best films I have ever seen.This comment I made 20 years or so ago, when I compiled a new 10 best or (most liked list.I saw this again last night & I am even more convinced of thisThis tale of Jewish gangsters of before and after the end of Prohibition in New York City was directed by Sergio Leone, who is neither from New York,Jewish & definitely not a gangster. Mr.Leoni had an eye for detail that very few can match,The production is superb in every department, The acting is as about flawless as can be. The film has a large cast headed by Robert Deniro, James Woods,Burt Young, Tuesday Weld, Elizabeth McGovern, Joe Pesci ( a cameo only), Danny Aiello playing a Police Captain of same name,(his scenes are about the only real humorous scenes in this drama). & the debut performance of one of todays leading actresses Jennifer Connally (you can see her talent then when she was still a teenager.The running time is a short 226 minutes (yes I said short). The scenes just fly by.. The original film ran 6 hours long, I sure would love to have seen that version. When first released in the U.S. it ran way under 3 hours & was a botched up job.NOTE (spoiler alert) be sure to stay through the credits, as there is one final scene, that may suggest that what we saw was something else.There are 2 rape scenes, one very explicit, BUT well done.

Taken," Impossible plot machinations, BUT fast furious action fun..
","Liam Neeson joins the long list of STARS who become lone action heroes rescuing a family member. What makes this film different is the running time of 91 minutes & this includes 6 minutes of credits.Credit this to the taut direction of Pierre Morell & the skillful writing of Luc Bresson (well known for this type screenplay) and Robert Mark Kamen.The above knew they had a very improbable script & they very wisely made the film run so fast the audience had no time to realize how idiotic & improbable the script was.. A few good fight scenes & 2 great car chases helped.Liam Neeson is first rate as an ex-CIA(type) employee rescuing his just kidnapped 17 year old daughter from being sold. He is a one man army,he has the charm to pull this off.I think he would have been a superb James Bond.I am unfamiliar with the rest of the cast,they all perform well.

Alice in Wonderland," A Disney classic seen through the eyes of Tim Burton & Johnny Depp.
","Over the years there have been many versions of Lewis Carroll's classic tale of the young girl who falls into a rabbit hole & has many adventures, with creatures of fantasy..The Disney Studies created more than a few & most were the same juvenile pablum.NOW this time, We still have a Disney Studio release, BUT with a most gifted craftsman as the director.TIM BURTON lets his very gifted imagination,go where few have gone before.Alice is no longer the star. now its THE MAD HATTER who has the lead, Of course there is only one actor today who can recreate that magic. JOHNNY DEPP. In my humble opinion he can get an Oscar for this. He deserves one by now anyway. Equally superb & award worthy is Helen Bonham Carter ( Mrs Tim Burton,by the way) as the RED QUEEN.Not forgetting the lass who is Alice, a bright newcomer. Mia Waskowska (a teen ager) is excellent as Alice.Yes they wisely made Alice into a teen ager, & is to me much more appealing. Anne Hathaway as the White Queen & Crispin Glover as the KNAVE. also shine.The make-up & special effected are flawless, the film is a combo of Live Action, Green Screen & computer animation, ALL expert;y done.A few minor gripes tho,some scenes could have been sped up while others (namely the prologue at the beginning & ending) could have been a bit longer). The also could have cut the title song (over the credits).Repeating, This is not our memory book version of Alice.It is a re-imagination by a most gifted artist Tim Burton & actor Johnny Depp.SEE IT FOR THESE REASONS if you are skeptical.Ratings: ***1/2 (out of 4) 91 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)",8,0,1,16 July 2010

I must have seen a different print.My rating of 3 stars,86 points & IMDb grade of 7 means this is a GOOD film,It is gratuitously violent, with overly excessive use of certain curse words, ,Even though I am 78 years young, I do not have too much objection to violence or cursing, BUT the screenplay carries it way over the top.THAT DEAR READERS DOES NOT MAKE A GREAT FILM.The Departed does have a great cast & all give top notch performances, Leo DeCaprio, Jack Nicholson,Matt Damon, Martion Sheen, Alec Baldwin,Mark Wahlburg, & Vern Farninga ( I hope that is the way it is spelled) are first rate actors, A few pf them could even read the Phone book & be great doing so,.Martin Scorcese directed this in his usual first rat manner, BUT this is not an Oscar winning film or direction. If he wins the Oscar it will be because he has been nominated 7 times & has not one one Oscar.The balance of the production credits are also first rate.the film is long though & could have been edited sharper,.SPOILER COMING UPThe violent ending,leave only one of the above mentioned cast alive.This movie was based on the first part of the Chinese Trilogy INFERNAL AFFAIRS which I haven't seen yet: so what the do I just do not know.rating *** out of 4: 86 points out of 100 IMDb 7 out of 10",7,2,7,16 February 2007
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," I have to write at least 10 lines, I hope I can,
","Ehren Kroger & Roberto Orci wrote this very juvenile script. I imagine that young children may enjoy the continuous bombardment of computer generated special effects (mostly explosions & fighting robots).Micheal Bay directed (that is what the credits say) his cast saying idiotic lines.As far as I am concerned this way too long childish script did this film in. Shia Labeouf is our (now) college aged hero,Megan Fox is again our heroine. John Turturro turns up half way thru (he is mostly comic relief). & is good as always.Our heroes parents feature in the beginning & ending. Kevin Dunn is the father he is capable BUT Julie White as the mother is an embarrassment. Again they are comic relief.In all films of this nature our hero has a silly buddy.Ramon Rodruguies fills this role. Rainn Wilson has 2 brief bits as a College professor. None of these characters except for our leads really fit in this supposed adventure story.The film was made in various parts of the world & the scenery is beautiful.As I stated in my review of the original film, this may have been better if all was animated.Many have made mention of the long running time,yes it is a very long 149 plus minutes, especially the finale which goes on & on.My rating is mainly for the special effects.Ratings: ** (out of 4) 57 points (out of 100) IMDb 5 (out of 10)",5,1,6,20 October 2009
The Holiday," delightful screwball comedy the way they used to make film.
","This is a delightful, romantic, screwball comedy,that does not make sense & it is not supposed to.This is the crazy kind of comedy that made our parents, Grandparents & still some of us laugh.Take 2 entirely different women (30 'ish) one In Hollywood & the other in England, they are unsatisfied with there current boy friends, & switch houses for a 2 week vacation.Cameron Diaz is our wealthy Hollywood executive,Kate Winslet is our English working girl, They just dumped Edward Burns & Rufus Sewell & trot off to each others house.Now it seems that Kate has a handsome brother Jude Law who drops in on supposed sisters house & meets Cameron, & thusly they fall for each other. Now back in Los Angeles. Kate is getting used to living in this luxurious house of Camerons & who walks in but a co-worker. Jack Black & of course we have another romance cooking.This fine foursome in roles written for them by Nancy Meyers have a field day. Ms.Meyers also capably directed trheis romp.Now add to this fun an old time Hollywood writer superbly played by 91 year young Eli Wallach..The film is long BUT for a 135 minute movies the pace is fast & you hardly realize it.The acting (except for a bit of silliness) is flawless.There also is an excellent well balanced song score that actually fits the scenes.Ratings ***1/2 (out of 4) 96 points(out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)",9,3,5,16 June 2007
There Will Be Blood," Correct title should be THERE WILL BE BOREDOM
","This movie is a 2 hour 39 minute very long bore.Spoiler alerts and other things I did not like: Camera pauses on faces or a set piece too long needlessly.Ending is inconclusive, Did Plainview get away with this murder like he did with an earlier one.How come there is not a likable person in the entire cast.Paul Dano portrays identical twins,we are not told this at all in there scenes together,I could not tell who was who, nor did I care.The music is entirely too loud,Why 'oh' why was there no major female role,did they not exist in theearly part of the last century.The actors in most scenes spoke so low, that I am glad I saw thiswith sub-titles as I would not have made out the dialog. By the waythere is no dialog for the first 20 minutes & we had no idea of Plainview was doing at the time in hole.Paul Thomas Anderson mis-directed & mis-wrote the screenplay,The story is based om Upton Sinclair's novel OIL. I am sure the novel was clearer than this piece of junk.Danny Day Lewis received an Oscar for this role. WHY,there was no development in his character,he did things for no apparent reason.He was a despicable person & we never learn why.As I stated there was not a single likable person in the cast.Four actors play the young son of Plainview none convincingly.Paul Dano does not come over as a minister. Ciarin Hinds (Ceaser in HBO's ROME0 is wasted in a small role. The same for Kevin J.O'Conner as Plainview's supposed brother, This is another undefined role.This film got some excellent reviews & some bad ones, For a change I fully agree with the bad ones.

Downfall," A cinematic master-film on the last 10 days of the Master Race
","It matters not what anyones political views or what there feeling are to Nazi Germany & especially the last 10 days of what happened in the Bunker.This is a MUST film for dedicated film goers, as finally we see this from the German viewpoint. This current year we also have a film seen from the Japanese perspective, LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA.The acting, direction, cinematography, settings etc, is meticulous in detail. Bruno Ganz(perhaps Germany's finest actor) is Adolf Hitler-- not so much in appearance, but in mood & performance, he perfectly captures what what we know about Hitler. All the actors are playing real people, there are no fictional character, & they are all exceedingly realistic.I sat at the edge of my comfortable rocker & was mesmerized by what was gong on, More than once I cringed at certain dialogue,The actress who portrays Frau Goebbels gives her reading of certain lines about her belief in NATIONAL SOCIALIZM in an ice cold monotone that sent a chili thru me,This version is only 156 very fast minutes, They are supposedly going to release a full 3 hour version, When they do I surely will purchase it.Included in the DVD I saw, there is a 1 hour documentary on the making of the film, & they do include a few scenes not on the DVD>.This documentary Is in-itself superb.The long running time went very fast, as the director & editor did there job perfectly.There may be one or two minor problems BUT this is a perfect a film as can possibly be.

The Last King of Scotland," Only one reason to see this movie FORREST WHITTAKER
","Forrest Whittaker is superb as Idi Amin & deserved the Oscar & other awards he has received. James McAvoy as Amin's Doctor & adviser looks much to young for his role,Actually the film is more about the Doctor & romance with Ido's third wife, This subplot hurts the film & if it were not for Whittaker's performance, & great cinematography, I would have given this a lower rating,.I will have to see McAvoy in another film before I will comment negatively on him,Here he comes across as eye candy only.We learn little about the reasons for Amin's action,they touch on The Raid on Entebbe,for moments only at the end of film.There are many horrific images of violence at end of film.

August Rush," This is a fantasy pure & simple.
","August Rush is one of those films that must be considered as pure fantasy. This gem is a combined,comedy,dramatic fantasy love story, with some first rate music.All this comes about by the excellent acting, Freddie Highmore, has charmed us already stealing scenes from Johnny Depp,(& thats hard to do)..Jonathan Rhys Myers adds another lusterous performance to he resume, He also sings a few songs.Kerri Russell is our charming heroine.Robin Williams has a nice role as well,& for a change he is somewhat subdued. Of course Freddie Highmore steals scenes from him & Robon let him get away with it.The story is pure fantasy, nothing is real except of the players/.

American Gangster," I saw HOODLUM & liked it better.
","At the very beginning of American Gangster we meet Bumpy Johnson. In 1997 there was a very good film made about him called HOODLUM. It covers the era before the events in this film occur.It starred Forest Whitaker. In 1997 Mr Whitaker was not that well known,as he is today so the film did not get the attention & the overly high praise that American Gangster has gotten. BOTH films are about Harlem gangsters & the drug culture. To be honest this is not one of my favorite story & plot lines.Denzel Washington is the star here playing Frank Lucas,who supposedly rose from being a flunky to Bumpy to being a head honcho in the Drrug trade. (not a character I would want to know)Russel Crowe (with a good Americn accent & a bad bad hair cut) is the government agent that brings him down,then at the end they become friendly.Doesn't that sound so familiar, or have I seen too many films.The acting by all is Great & so is the production, except for one other thing,. It is WAY WAY TOO LONG.I saw the extended 176 minute version & not the shorter theatre version (19 minutes added).The running time just under 3 hours seemed like 5.The production is first rate, the acting is excellent by all.

The Green Mile," 3 hours , 8 minutes & 12 seconds of boredom
","I sat for  3hrs,8min & 12sec,  watching this very well acted & effectively made bore. The story makes no sense to me whatsoever, I did  not for one second believe any of the story line Stephan King wrote the original story, The director  Frank Darabont wrote the screenplay, The same director did The Shawshank Redemption, ,which was supreme entertainment, You had people you could care for in that one. In this film,none of the major performers are any one who you would want to know. The Guards are all except one  too nice & sweet, The  Inmates are either loonies, or half wits. The main convict a big 6ft 8 in giant is a sweet dumb...../.

The Reader," Not deserving any honors,a vast disappointment in every department.
","Now to expand & explain my above summary.Stephen Daldry Directed & David Hare adapted the screenplay.in the same sloppy,disjointed manner they did with THE HOURS a few years back.The Hours was at least well acted,& Kate Winslet did a more believable acting job in that than she does here. I,for one cannot conceive why she was even nominated for any awards for this very uninteresting, unbelievable and unconvincing role.SPOILER ALERT===== SPOILER ALERTShe is supposed to be illiterate, We first see her in 1955 as' a street car conductor,I doubt that any transit company would hire a person who could not read. 11 years earlier,she is in the SS & a guard at a Concentration Camp, I doubt very much that the SS would of head her in that position. We now jump 10 more years to her WAR CRIMES trail.She and 4 other female guards were transporting inmates (mainly women & Children). Due to a raging storm,the inmates are sheltered in a church,which conveniently gets bombed,They do not let the inmates out all perish except one mother and child do miraculously escape.(we find this out later). Granted this is a tragic event, BUT i did not believe one iota of it. I may have seen this tragedy played out before, either in a Civil War or Native American story.All the above is in the second half of the movie, the first part,her sexual escapades with a very good looking 15 year old boy.(they cast a 17 yr old lad & had to wait till he was 18 to do the nude sex scenes)Granted the lad was 'horney', but did we need to see so many naked sex scenes.David Kross is the lad & he does a good job. We also see him at 23,when she is on trail. How convenient,illogical would be better.Ralph Fiennes is the lad (Micheal) all grown up in more modern scenes, See while the were having sexy t years ago he was reading to her not knowing she was illiterate. He sends her tapes in prison & she learns to read. I was not convinced,in fact I was bored & talking back to the screen. Ralph is usually much better, here he is DULL>The settings are OK,the aging makeup is good, Maybe some one will explain this to me.Ratings: ** (out of 10) 54 points(out of 100) IMDb 4 (out of 10)",4,0,6,15 April 2009
The Wrestler," Mickey Rourke's superb performance saves the movie.
","Mickey Rourke was a good actor 20 some odd years ago, then persona demons brought his promising career to a halt.This movie revives his career. He has received many rewards for this performance as a wrestler at the end of a long career, no longer the star wrestler he once was.Darren Aronofsky directed, The sparse screenplay was written by Robert D. Seigal, This my friends is the reason I cannot give this a higher rating. Mr.Aronofsky should have also written the screenplay,like he did with Requiem for a Dream,He added humour to Requiem & that helped make that a superior film, we were able to take the grimness in stride. In this film, there is very little humour, & felt no sadness at the unhappy ending.The acting by all,especially Mickey Rourke gives the film its rating.Marissa Tomei is also equally good as a pole dancer, Evan Rachel Ward as his daughter was also wonderful.The wrestling scenes are very brief;devotees of the sport may enjoy this more than I did.Ratings: *** (ouit of 4) 83 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)",7,1,1,22 April 2009
Hancock," I wanted to like this but I did not.
","This Will Smith film is not the sort of movie, that this fine actor usually make, I could not & neither will audiences accept him as a drunk,bum like appearing super hero. The last 30 minutes or so where we find out many surprises about him & one of his co-stars is not the least bit believable.The script by Vincent Ngo & Vince Gilligan is not one bit believable, The script for Superhero movies should have at least a wee bit of believability for them to be acceptable.Hancock has none.The director Peter Berg was asleep at the switch.Will Smith is a fine actor, & tries his best with this awful material, he almost succeeds. Charlize Theron usually an excellent actress has a difficult role & also tries hard, somehow she is not convincing. Jason Bateman with a different hair style is good but also not as good as he has been in other movies.]We have a lil boy in the movie as well- Jae Head. The kid is OK but not as good as Will's own son in his last film. - The special effects mostly CGI were good, but nothing we have not seen before.I think only die-hard Will Smith fans may enjoy this.Ratings: **1/2--out of 4--66 points out of 100---IMDB 6--out of 10NOTE: 66 points is at the low end of a **1/2 rating",6,0,3,26 November 2008
Shooter," For those that like improbable action packed films, A MUST SEE
","My summary & rating says it all.Shooter is a STAR vehicle for Mark Wahlberg in the same manner all the more likable action movies have been made lately. You make your hero almost invincible,put him & his cohorts in impossible situations & locations, He could even get badly hurt, chased & wanted dead or alive by both the good guys & the bad guys.Give him a wee bit of romance (around the half way mark) have a sidekick,that adds some unintentional humour,OH yes we must have villains, a few could be supposedly on his side, (did I say double & triple cross), NOW as to the chief villain, we must not suspect him when we see him or her the first time.Every item I mentioned above PLUS more occurs in the SLAM BANG action film, It is improbable as all get out, even though many scenes are very truthful.Anthony Fuqua directed from a screenplay by Jonathan Lemkin,which he based on a novel by Stephen Hunter,many deviations from the novel were made. Mr. Fuqua is a very talented director & created a first class action movie.Mark Wahlberg is a talent now to be reckoned with,add action roles to his resume. In solid support as his sidekick & sometimes adversary is Micheal Pena.He is an up & coming performer who will be a star before too long. Danny Glover, Elias Koteas & Ned Beaty have great roles as well, I will not spoil the surprise by saying who the main villain is.Kate Mara provides the wee bit of romance.Locatios cinematography is great, All credits & special effects are first rate,I had a great time watching this, Just suspend belief & enjoy it.Ratings *** (out of 4) 88 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10O",8,1,5,27 June 2007
Inception," The conception of Inception is a deception
","I must have seen a different film than all those who gave this such a high rating.By making this interesting plot of dream interception into an action film was not a good idea (to me at any rate)Most of the budget went to the cost of bullets, explosions & car crashes.The film runs 148 LONG minutes, We probably have a real decent drama of 90 minutes.Leonardo Decaprio is as usual good..The supporting players are all name actors,BUT they do not have much to do except shoot bullets & wreck cars.The production is good,its the script & needless constant action that hurts the film.Ratings: **1/2--- 74 points --- IMDb 6",6,7,11,4 January 2011
Defiance," Yet another so called true story,by way of Hollywwod.
","This supposed true story of how 3 brothers helped save over 1200 Jews in Nazi occupied White Russia (Belarus-now) is the usual Hollywood version. Edward Zwick directed & co-wrote the the screenplay with Clayton Frohman.About 15 years ago,Steven Spielburg made Schindler's List a fine movie but it had faults, but you did feel some emotional truths.Defiance,on the other hand is well acted but I felt no emotion but boredom.I almost dozed off a few times. It has many clichés, like in only one example, 2 of the brothers have a big fight & drift apart for part of movie, BUT at a climatic moment they are back together. Also just to titillate the paying customers,we have a tasteful nude love scene.The brothers are played by Daniel Craig, Liev Schrieber & Jamie Bell. They are good,the entire cast is good,BUT with so many accents,it was hard to know what language they really'were speaking.

If these were songs from a Disney film it might have been acceptable. These were 2 song from Hello Dolly, from 20th Century Fox.Hello Dolly was a fine stage musical,but just a so-so film.There is no dialogue in this wasted effort for nearly 40 minutes, what there is is plain idiotic.The film cost about $ 180 Million.It is a wasteof money, time & talent.I also find this trashy film not fit material children even.Ratings: * (out of 4) 25 points (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10)_",1,16,56,12 March 2009
The Good Shepherd," Story of the beginning of the CIA
","This long BUT never boring film written by Eric Roth & directed by Robert DeNiro has many more good points than bad ones.It is a very literate screenplay that thankfully has no explosions car crashes & next to no CGI.There is an absolute minimum of foul language, the few sex scenes are very tastefully handled. There are also very few violent scenes, this tends to make the one torture scene stand out.The film is mostly fiction ,even though its about real events. (creation of OSS & CIA up to after the Bay of Pigs debacle.Matt Damon is outstanding as a composite character,It is a hard role to play as his character is very quiet & humourless.(which is the opposite of Matt Damon in real life. Angelina Jolie is is long suffering wife & is also excellent, Most of the major roes are played by name actors. Robert Denirp besides directing portrays a person based on Wild Bill Donavan the man who FDR chose to head the OSS.Joe Pesci, William Baldwin, William Hurt,are among others who standout.This is a long movie & except for the very last scenes hold your full interest throughout, The last 20 minutes of so is not as good as earlier scenes, In other words the conclusion is not as memorable as it should of or could of been, The production credits are outstanding all the way.Ratings, ***1/2 (out of 4) 91 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)",8,2,3,5 April 2007
Music and Lyrics," This nice musical is not for lovers of Hollywood Musicals
","Music & Lyrics is a Musical Comedy is from Warner Bros., a studio known for pleasant musical comedies NOT great one & only rare good ones. This is not one of the good ones even.The Director Marc Lawirence also wrote the screenplay,he must have seen a Doris Day, Gordon MacCrae musical & thought it would be fun to do a modern version.He did find 2 STARS --Hugh Grant & Drew Barrymore., He apparently forgot neither are singers. He also forgot to have name supporting actors in the other roles.When Doris & Gordon were making films, the supporting players were Jack Carson, Eve Arden & Janis Paige (all name performers) & maybe a few other names or new faces.The supporting cast in Music & Lyrics are unknowns & probably will stay that way.To this films credit tho,, the musical numbers are performed live & the songs are good. The cast tries vainly to do a good job & some scenes are very funny, a few however are very silly & or make no sense.If this film were a film from 50-60 yrs ago the rating would be about the same,It is a nice pleasant musical comedy,that you will forget you saw very quickly.Ratings: **1/2 (out of 4) 74 points (out of 100) IMDb 6 out of 10)",6,0,1,10 May 2007

In fact the acting by the entire cast is superb, deserves mentioning,Micheal Sheen is the exuberant Tony Blair, newly elected PM & in a crisis his first week. (side note as of this date he is still the PM)James Cromwell is properly stodgy as Prince Philip. Alex Jennings does a fine job as Prince Charles (Diana's ex-husband) Sylvia Sims portrays the aged Queen Mother perfectly.We see some of the private lives of both the Roayl Family & the Prime Ministers. We really have no way of knowing how truthful any of these scenes are,They were done so well I did accept than as movie fact, not necessarily the whole truth but truthful enough to be accepted.The cinematography especially the scenes near Balmaral Castle are fantastic.

This time I WAS BORED STIFF.I was more amused with the awful Batman film with the Governor of California as MR FREEZE, than this movie.Robert Downey Jr, does a decent job as our reluctant hero, He is an exceptionally capable actor.Terrence Howard as the Air Force Colonel who is our hero's best buddy. is very good as he always is.Gwyneth Paltrow is the required girl Friday & of course she is real good.We of course have a villain & guess what,its the only other name actor in the cast; Jeff Bridges. Now Jeff has been around sound stages since he was a teen actor,& proves he can do a villains role.Nearly all the action scenes are CGI (computer generated imaging).There are also many explosions.I was waiting for something exciting to happen. I guess I will have to wait till next weeks, let us hope I can tell you I liked those better.

Casino Royale," too long, too much CGI, just TOO MUCH
","My summary just about sums it all up. It is too long the 146 minute running time seemed like 246 minutes.There was too much CGI many scenes felt like a computer game;There were also too many locations, The opening number was like a Rube Goldberg Cartoon. The ending with the sinking of a building in Venice was needless & almost embarrassing.Much of the dialog I had trouble understanding, Lucky I saw a closed caption credits version.Martin Campbell directed this mess. The editing needed editing. One other point, if this took place at the beginning of his career, how come all those new gadgets I-pod's or whatever they are CALLED. '' Dame Judi Dench portrays M & is good . Jeffrey Wright's role is way to short. Eva Green was the requisite lady, She is very beautiful,BUT not much of actress,OH yes there is a main villain played by Mads Mikkessen he is OK but there have been much better villains.By the time we get to the torture scene,it looked good BUT we know it wasn't for real.OH yes James Bond himself , we have a new one Daniel Craigbest thing About him is his fantastic body. nearly all previous Bonds were better to some degree.Rating:**1/2 (out of 4) 73 points (out of 100) IMDD 6 (out of 10)",6,1,3,6 April 2007
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Javier Bardem,The music & the settings are the best part.
","The film is set in beautiful Barcelona & also Ovieda. The music score is excellent.Javier Bardem, one of Spain's best actors dominates every scene he is in (he usually does this in all his film-----he is that powerful of an actor. The film was written & directed by Woody Allen. Thankfully Mr. Allen does not have a role. This time we have a narrator,Christopher Even Welch, His narration is OK, AT least it is not as annoying as it would have been if Mr.Allen did it.The main leads are done by the fine talents of; Rebecca Hall, Scarlett Johannsen, & Penelope Cruz,Miss Cruz got a deserved Oscar for her frenetic performance.Patricia Clarkson gives another fine job.This is a good comedy that Mr.Allen allowed to get overly farcial t the end.My rating is a thumbs up mainly for Bardem, & the excellent music score, and of course Penelope Cruz.

Beowulf," A supposedly great epic poem, becomes a juvenile cartoon
","Many years ago, I tried to read Beowulf, but had to give up on it because I had trouble understanding the 'olde' English prose it was in. I had troubles with Chaucer for same reason.Now the film I saw on DVD last night,I doubt it had much to do with the epic poem. This was more like a comic strip gone wild.Ray Winstone was good in the lead, as well as all the other well known actors,if you were able to make out who was who, (too many fat suits & bushy beards & makeup for me.Angelina Jolie is a beauty but was not believable, in her performance.Most of the blame goes to the director, who has made very few decent films, that I actually enjoyed. (his'Back to the Future'series was overly loud & excessively unfunny--he also made the atrocious all-star western {I forgot title},which was nothing but violence added on top of more violence.)He does the same thing hereI have no objection to violence in films. ( 300---Kill Bill & Grindhouse were excellently made, the violence was natural & normal for its stories.

Director Lee Wiseman & Writer Mark Bombeck combine in creating another vehicle for Bruce Willis to shine again as John MacClaine.Like the first 3 in this series, we have a sidekick, this time a young actor JUSTIN LONG,He does a first class job as a computer hacker who help save the day.We also have a dastardly villain, this time played by handsome actor TIMOTHY OLYPHANT & he sure is nasty, Now a days we also have a feminine side kick for the villain, Maggie Q fills this part nicely.Bruce Willis as usual is pitch perfect as the tired cop doing his job.The film is overloaded with action & CGI, Apparantky you cannot have an action film now-a-days without death defying impossible stunts.The film runs a bit over 2 hours & at least 2/3 chases, explosions or fights.I have always enjoyed films like this, you know what to expect in nearly every scene & if a charismatic hero is on screen I can sit back & enjoy what happens.Watching this film is like visiting an old friend,who is getting on in age,you just accept him with all his faults,Rating *** (out of 4) 82 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)",7,0,2,22 November 2007
Amélie," What Bore this film was.
","I highly anticipated this film, as it received mostly great reviews & was given many award nominations. What I saw was a picture post card of beautiful Paris & surrounding areas, nicely acted by all. BUT  where oh where was the story, The film ran over 2 hours, That was 40 minutes longer than it deserved. When are we going to see films about happy nice people living their lives & not neurotics like displayed here. This was supposed to be a comedy & I hardly laughed lightly  more than twice. Rating   **1/2     78 points   IMDb  7",7,4,9,9 February 2003
Click," For some insane reason I am giving this a reasonably good review.
","I am not a huge Adam Sandler fan, His brand of comedy & my brand are vastly different. I saw this film mainly because it was nominated for an Academy Award for Make-up, & that fact alone was my reason to watch this,.I am GLAD that I did,It is a wacky comedy farce about an overworked man, his family & a wild remote control. It is quite silly at times, BUT there is an inner truth to many scenes. These are basically all nice people who we all can care about.This is not a subtle film,as the conclusion is foretold quite obviously (SPOILER ALERT) when he lays down on the bed.This of course was the obvious ending anyway, we all have seen ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE,(or should have)One other reason for me liking this film, is that it moves fast. It is about 105 minutes long but seems much shorter.There is a large song score as well, many songs fit the scene.Now as too the make-up,Since the characters do age, the make-up also ages & is expertly done, There is body suit make-up as well,that is very good, Its a deserved nomination BUT the other two nominees are somewhat better.The large cast is very good, all are veteran performers we have seen many times. (too many to name all & I would not want to leave any out.) I think audiences will find some merit in the farce & appreciate Adam Sandler's versatility.RATING *** out of 4---82 points out of 100---- IMDb 7 --- out of 10.",7,0,1,18 February 2007
Pineapple Express," more inspired insanity from Judd Apatow & his cronies.
","PINEAPPLE EXPRESS is supposedly the ideal smoke-able weed. I would not know about that stuff,as I do not smoke & way past the age where I need to get high on anything.Who would think that a story revolving around a group of stoned pot-heads,crooked cops, Asian murderous gangs, also an underground pot farm,which is part of an old US Government conspiracy would ever appeal to me, or any other sane movie goer.Apparently,we were all very wrong, This insane comic, slapstick farce made way over One Hundred Million dollars in the US alone.I loved it & I do not usually like slapstick farces. Judd Apatow already has proved himself as a writer,producer & director,.He seems to have as stock company of writers & performers who ably assist in creating these insane delights.Judd wrote the original story, he & Seth Rogan & Evan Goldberg wrote the screenplay, I am also going to say some of the dialog was improvised by various cast members.the director is David Gordon Green.( I know I want to see more of his films).The entire cast is great and includes.James Franco who is not known for this type of comedy,is superb & really did deserve his Golden Globe award. Seth Rogan is a gifted a comic actor as he is a writer.I fully ignored the fact that his girl friend is still a mid teen.(we have to remember the film is fantasy). Danny Mc Bride is there hapless cohort. Gary Cole is the nasty murderous villain & Rosie Perez is a crooked cop.Perhaps the only gripe I have is the length, slapstick farces of this kind should not be nearly 2 hours long. In this case however, the story went so fast, I did not realize the time, Neither will you. Also the 'f' words are used many many times.here it was not that offensive to me at any rate.Excellent scenery,sets, sound, music etc.Put all your good sense aside & see the this,.RATINGS: ***1/2 (out of 4) 92 points (out of 100) IMBB 9 (out of 10)",9,0,2,30 May 2009
Moon," Both the film & star SAM ROCKWELL should have nominated for Oscars.
","MOON is a very fine example of a 'sci-fi' movie made on a low budget on studio sets. This is the way films used to be made.This is a first time directorial and writing effort as well,.Duncan Jones wrote the original story & directed; his partner Nathan Parker wrote the screenplay. WE WILL see more of this creative teams work.Sam Rockwell who has given fine performances for over 15 years in film & on TV. gives what actually amounts to a SOLO performance. He should have been nominated for an Oscar, He was nominated for a BAFTA award.Sam WILL win an Oscar one year, It would be a shame if he did not.The only other major name in the cast is Kevin Spacey, he is the computer voice & of course does a fine job.The story takes place on the far side of the Moon, in a large space lab. If you let your imagination loose, you will feel you are in that lab.There are few fancy space type shots, that we see in similar films.This is a fine 2009 low budget film like they used to make.Ratings: ***1/2 (out of 4) 96 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)",9,0,2,15 March 2010
Slumdog Millionaire," Another film that did not deserve the best film Oscar.
","Let me start off here, with a reason for my rating of 9. It is based on the excellent production values and some very good acting. The direction by Danny Boyle is excellent.The script however is lacking in believability.As we all know our young hero is a contestant on a TV program, Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, I for one hated the Version of this show when it was on the air in the US. The parts we see see in the movie are as annoying as it was on TV. (spoiler alert)_I tend to agree with the reasons why the police arrest our lad.There are some very grim scenes in the first part of movie but then like all fantasies we have the happy ending.The last 20 minutes were exceedingly long & very repetitious. I was getting bored, I knew what was going to happen they took forever getting there.Over the 80 some odd years of the Oscar, there have been quite a few that did not deserve the best film award.Add Slumdog Millionaire to the list. Here are just a few of the others, that do not belong.Crash-----Gentlemens Agreement-----The Sting-- The Apartment. all are very good movies BUT none deserved best film Oscar.Ratings:***1/2 (out of 4) 93 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)",9,0,3,31 March 2009
Gladiator," There have been much better films on this theme
","Firstly, I was able to tell what was going to happen from one scene to the next. no suspense or real drama Next:  The poorest use of CGI - I cant believe that I was able to spot all the computer effects (crowd scenes mainly & the entry to Rome. How this one any academy awards is beyond me.This is 2 years in a row that an an undeserving Dreamworks film won an oscar. I cant believe everyone is so in awe of Spielburg they honor anything he is associated with. For better movies of about a Gladiator  Or this period of time seeSPARTACUS  OR  THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE OR EVE  QUO VADIS   Fall of the Roman Empire was not that great a film but it sure surpasses this mess. & believe or not was more truthful in the story of the Emperor Commodus  & Marcus Aurelius. Commodus was a trained expert wrestler  & fought many times in the games, obviously he always won, except the final time.  Besides  having a yen for his sister he liked the boys also & that was completely left out.as alwaysjay harris",4,0,1,6 June 2001
The Pursuit of Happyness," I wish I liked this better than I did
","Will Smith & his real son Jared both received very well deserved Oscar nominations for there finely etched performances.They say that this is a true story,Now maybe I am as skeptic, It sure reads like a human interest story in Readers Digest.Struggling father left with small son, whose wife deserted him, and his subsequent search for a better job & somewhere to live when his money runs out.There were some scenes that bordered on slapstick comedy,maybe they did this to remind us that the star Will Smith usually does comic style roles & here is very serious.The setting is in San Francisco & every day is very clear & sunny.OOPS. as we all know not every day is clear & sunny in the city by the bay. They just must of had a string of good days for filming/ .See this for the fine acting & not the story.ratings' *** (out of 4) 82 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)",7,0,0,29 March 2007
The Proposal," this is not my idea of a romantic comedy
","This mess of a movie stars Sandra Bullock looking every bit of her 40 plus years. Ryan Reynolds looking & acting much younger than his 30 plus years have zero chemistry as a romantic team.'Tis a pity because both are talented performers.Here they are done in by first time screenwriter Pete Chiarelli, let us up he improves. Anne Fletcher misdirected. The rest of cast includes Craig T.Nelson & Mary Steenbergen as Ryan'parents, They are OK in thankless roles. Betty White is his Grandmother,she is not as good as others said she was.The major action supposedly takes place in Sitka Alaska, It is very obvious it is not Alaska. It was made in Rhode Island & Massechussets.It may have been more believable if it was made on studio sets.There is a puppy-dog in a few scenes,I wonder it it was a real dog or digital effects,It did not seem real.This story has been done in many forms already,I would not have minded if it was funny like some 'rom-coms' of the past.It is also way, way too long 105 minutes is about 20 minutes longer than it should have been.Ratings: ** (out of 4) 53 points(out of 100) IMDb 4 (out of 10)",4,5,7,15 October 2009
Cinderella Man," Mixed review, story is for the birds, production is first rate
","I know I am in the minority in reviewing Cinderella Man,, I thought it was a big bore.This is the story of James Braddock, a second rate boxer who beat Max Baer & became the heavy weight Champion, We, or most of us know he was the guy Joe Louis knocked out in the first round to start his long career as CHAMP.As presented here, its mostly a romantic love story with his wife, superbly played by Rene Zelliger. Russell Crowe is effective as Braddock...He has done many better roles. Paul Giamatti is his agent/trainer, even tho its a dramatic role,it comes across as comic relief.The settings are very good, except I don't believe Madison Square Garden looked that way, I was there many ties in the late 1930's & 1940's. & also there was no trolley cars on Eighth Avenue then.Ron Howard directed this nostalgic looking film, & like his latest film (The DaVinci Code),he bit off more than he could chew.There have been many great boxing films, this does not come close to being in same category, as Champion,Million Dollar Baby,Raging Bull, The Set Up.rating **1/2 out of 4 74 points out of 100, IMDb 6 out of 10",6,2,4,26 June 2006
Valkyrie," A first rate film,about the abortive attempt to kill Hitler.
","Valkyrie directed by Bryan Singer with a screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie & Nathan Alexander is not the first film about Col. Stauffenburg & the abortive attempt to kill Hitler prior to the end of World War 2,it has been done a few times in both film & Television,. Since we do not know every fact of this event,we have to accept part is pure fiction.The film is first rate in all departments, excellent sets and costumes very good acting by a large cast.Tom Cruise is quite good as Col.Stauffenburg.He is more than ably assisted by; Kenneth Branagh,Bill Nighy,Tom Wilkinson, Terrance Stamp, plus others. David Bamber portrays Hitler in a slightly different manner than he usually is portrayed.The one drawback I have & the main reason this does not get a higher rating from me is.There is no suspense, we all know (or should know) Hitler lived,& the plot failed.It is still a very worthwhile film,there is very little action, no sex scenes & next to no foul language.Ratings: ***1/2 (out of 4) 95 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)",9,2,3,19 May 2009
The Simpsons Movie," Devotess of the TV show STAY AWAY
","The movie is a mess.What we have here is a 79 (long) minute cartoon with 8 minutes of credits.My partner & I barely chuckled a few times. no laughs at all.When we watched TV episodes we always were laughing out loud & expected to do the same,We get our films from NETFLIX & see about 25 per month.so this cost approximately $ 1.00We feel sorry for those that spent up to $ 14.00 (per seat) to see this waste of talent.Also we do not understand all the good reviews, You all had to see a different film.This is one of the most disappointing films of the year.Ratings: ** (out of 4) 52 points(out or 100) IMDb 4 (out of 19\)",5,2,4,18 December 2007
The Wizard of Oz," Newly re-mastered print makes this better than ever.
","We saw a re-mastered DVD print of this the other afternoon.It seemed as fresh & beautiful as it did on one Saturday afternoon way back in 1939,.The above rating of 9 is correct as there are some minor uncorrectable problems.for example you were able to tell that Judy Garland was too old to play Dorothy. She still was terrific & her singing of Over the Rainbow was perfection.For a change this print has the Kansas scenes in the original Sepiatone & not Black & White like on TV>The entire cast does the very best it can. Bert Lahr, Jack Haley,Ray Bolger, Frank Morgan & Margaret Hamilton are excellent. This is a classic motion picture that can be seen over & over again.This was maybe was my 30th viewing.rating ***1/2 out of 4== 95 points out of 100== IMDb 9 out of 10",9,3,4,16 February 2007
The Soloist," Yet another supposedly true story, I found utterly unbelievable..
","The Soloist is another example of a movie that starts with the assumption the audience knows who then characters are & what the movie will be all about.There are only two main characters in this sad tale of a reporter trying to find a story when he meets this talented but mentally flawed homeless man playing a violin with missing strings.Robert Downey Jr. is Steve Lopez a reporter for the Los Angeles Times who writes human interest stories. Since I live in Los Angeles & read the Times every day I am familiar with Mr Lopez & his writings. I am being very picky here, The do show a 'pic' of Mr. Lopez with his column & his hair seems very white. Mr. Downey has very dark hard & to me it did not help his characterization. I felt he was not convincing in his part.Jaime Foxx is Lawrence Ayers, an ex-Juliliard student, homeless & with mental problems,He was a fine cello player.We do see the plight of the homeless people vividly portrayed. Since this plight is basically the crux of the film,it is not a happy or enjoyable movie.There is some beautiful music played, BUT to be truthfully honest String music does nothing for me. I am a piano man. Mr Foxx was Ray Charles a few years back,Mr Charles was a troubled man as well. The music made that film very exciting & interesting to me. To me Violin & Cello music does not excite me at all.Thusly I found the film a big bore.It was supposed to be released for last years Oscar race,Wisely they did not,as was not worthy of any award consideration.Joe Wright directed from Susannah Grant's screen play which she adapted from Steve Lopez' book.Filmed on the streets of downtown Los Angeles. Running time is a long 117 minutes,Ratings: **1/2 (out of 4) 66 points (out of 100) IMDb 5 (out of 10).NOTE: 66 points is at the bottom range of the 2-1/2 * rating.",5,1,3,6 August 2009
Law Abiding Citizen," Good thriller if you put your & good sense on hold.
","For those that have seen movies since way back when, this film will remind you of improbable films that were the mainstay of second features of double bills. Thw story is not logical & it has a very weak ending.The above being said,I liked what I saw & do feel most of you will feel the same.Considering the two lead actors you know will appreciate there talents. Jamie Foxx & Gerard Butler are on opposite sides of the law here, even tho Butler is a good guy at the beginning.F.Gary Gray directed Kurt Wimmer's script. Both the script & direction could have been a bit tighter.This film is about violent crimes BUT it is not excessively so.Film in the Philadelphia area,very good cinematography & settings.The acting by all is quite good/The film has flaws BUT it is exciting & enjoyable.Ratings: *** (out of 4) 83 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)",7,0,0,9 March 2010
Up in the Air," a slight disappointment
","Up In The Air is not a bad film, it just is not as good as I was led to believe.Jason Reitman, a very gifted new film writer & director has lots of talent, He should have a long successful career ahead of him.He Directed & co-wrote (with Sheldon Turner), this somewhat clever screenplay based on novel by Walter Krin.It also has a first rate cast, headed by George Clooney & 2 fine actresses Vera Farninga & Anna Kendrick. All 3 were nominated for Oscars, The 2 actresses definitely deserved there nominations.There also is some nice scenery & settings.One gripe I have is that it seemed much longer than it actually was. This was because of a needless weak song score, especially the opening credits, 'My Land is Your Land' should never be done to a rock melody, The song is a patriotic song & should be played & sung as one.I really doubt there are firms such as depicted in this film. I do not think firing people are done this way.See this for the acting of the 2 actresses,they are worth viewing.Ratings: **1/2 (out of 4) 77 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)",7,1,2,11 March 2010
Atonement," Boring,unbelievable not convincing,BUT does recreate the period.
","This film is mis-directed by Joe Wright,badly written by Christopher Hampton & adapted from the novel by Ian McEwan does recreate the atmosphere of 1935 England,& the Dunkirk Beach of 1941. The sets, costumes & cinematography are the best parts of this film & that is the only reason for my rating of 6.The story is unbelievable, contrived & worst of all unconvincing.The performers go through their roles,without making me care what happens to them.This may because the script has elements of far better movies.The Children's Hour (lying young girl ruining lives)A Place Under the Sun (tragic love story--factory worker & rich young woman)Mrs.Miniver (tragic events at Dunkirk)Watching scenes unfold in this film brought back BETTER memories of the above 3 films.Now to the cast.James McAvoy is terribly miscast as our our hero. Keira Knigfhtly as our heroine is a beautiful lady & that is about all.It takes 3 actresses to portray the young lady who who tells a lie,spurring the inevitable tragic events. Soirese Roman as a cute 13 year old jealous little lying vixen Romola Garai, same gal at age 18 & now a nurse,& many years later Vanessa Redgrave (in cameo role) as on old woman who has just written a novel about what happened.SPOILER ALERT --James McAvoy spends some time in prison because of the lies. We do not see him in any prison scenes, & when he says it was rough, he shows no emotion of what happened to him. Mr.McAvoy is slight build & very handsome--'nuff' said.The scenes on the Dunkirk beach are the best scenes in the movie, BUT unless you know the story of Dunkirk (we aren't told where we are) you will be confused.They used to make many romantic movies with a war background. Some were excellent, some were just good,ATONEMENT will not be remembered.NOW I see why it got so few award, It deserved noneRatings: **1/2 (out of 4) 72 points (out of 100) IMDb 6 (out of 1)",6,1,2,20 March 2008
V for Vendetta," Why did I wait so long to see this Excellent film?
","Thats a very good question, I have done this before, I delay seeing some films, because of the possibility I may not like it. I usually wind up loving the movie & wonder why I never bothered with it upon its release. If I had seen this in 2005 it would have been in my top films of the year. This is an action film by the masters of action films. the Wachowski Brothers. This is based on an graphic novel.It has a large mostly UK cast, lead by Hugo Weaving & Natalie Portman,they both are excellent & are ably supported by Stephen Rae, John Hurt, Tim Piggot-Smith=Stepehen Fry, Rupert Graves & Sinead Cusack..

Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," overlong & nearly no likable persons
","This is a hard film to like. There are hardly any characters in this stupid face of a comedy that I liked or cared for.If I cant find any one to root for or care about one way or the other in any movie,There is no way I could give it a passing grade.The running time for this move is 122 minutes & that is way way to long for a comedy farce.Part of the racing scenes were good,the crash scenes were exercises in using the computer to create the special effect. Overdone to the max.The acting is OK, BUT Sacha Cohen was excellent as the French Driver.
