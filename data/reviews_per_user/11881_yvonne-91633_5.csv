The Equalizer," Another Denzel Washington Triumph
","I can't remember ever watching a Denzel Washington film I didn't enjoy and this one was no exception.I can remember English actor Edward Woodward pioneering the original American, made for television series, back in the late 1980s and bringing the role of Robert McCall to our screens.Denzel does amazing justice to the film version of this debut vigilante role, with a strong story line full of action and violence and a depth of character which sets the scene nicely for any follow-ups which may come along ... 'The Equalizer' is born!",7,0,2,15 March 2017
Deja Vu," U CAN SAVE HER
","I have to admit right away, that science fiction, which includes time travel, is not one of my favourite genres, simply because I struggle to understand the niceties of the story line, more often than not.Not being a very patient person, and hubbie having watched this film multiple times, I made him keep pausing the action to explain both the current and upcoming scenes to me ... frustrating for him I know, but I also hate surprises!Is Denzel Washington typecast? Probably
Does he ever make a bad film? NeverYou could almost believe that he is playing out almost every character he has ever portrayed, in the way in which he approaches real life situations - cool, calm and collected.The plot was well considered and played out without any awkward continuity moments. The special effects and crowd scenes were meticulous and well executed and Val Kilmer played the perfect foil to Denzel's character.If you were not quite as sceptical as myself, you could not have failed to find this a very thought provoking, immersive and intriguing film.",8,0,0,21 January 2018
Non-Stop," Good Entertainment Value
","As confirmed Liam Neeson fans, I settled down to watch this film as an off-chance discovery whilst channel surfing and with only the very short television synopsis to guide me.There are so many aeroplane disaster films out there, that coming up with a unique and interesting storyline was always going to be difficult.Having said that, I was uncertain about the identity of the 'baddie', until the big reveal close to the end of the film, which was all to the good and which raised the points rating.The main thing in which I was a little disappointed, was that when the motive for the crime was eventually revealed, it just didn't seem very plausible, which meant that what started out as a good solid plot, with strong characters, turned into a rather weakened affair, with no obvious sense of purpose.'Non-Stop' still offered good entertainment value and I didn't need to think too hard about it!",7,0,1,7 December 2015
Beauty and the Beast," A Good Adaptation Of This Popular Disney Classic
","I suppose that I am coming at this review from the angle of a complete Disneyphile, who has visited Disney World Orlando almost 30 times and has seen the Disney Studios (MGM) live stage production of the show, more times than I care to rememeber, with just about every member of my family and extended family and it was always a firm favourite.I have also seen the London stage show of the production three times, so I think I know all the little nuances and quirks there are.For me, this film version was true to the original in almost every sense. The cast, music and singers were chosen with great care and attention to detail and the CGI portions of the film were impeccable.Yes, there was perhaps some added innuendo, however this was done in the best possible taste, making the film a complete package and great family viewing.",8,1,2,1 January 2018
Man on Fire," A Total Emotional Roller-coaster
","Denzel Washington never disappoints and in this better than average crime thriller, he offers up an outstanding performance as the morbidly depressive, alcoholic, ex CIA assassin, Creasy.Creasy, a man hell-bent on self destruction, has his heart laid claim to by his employer's young daughter, Pita and her mother Lisa, who touch him as no-one else has been able to for quite some time.When Creasy feels he has failed to protect his young charge, he sets out on a single handed revenge mission, which takes him far closer to home than he could ever have imagined! I have yet to read the book on which the film was based and I am not even sure that I should, as nothing can really come close to the intensity and emotional connection the film made on me.",9,3,4,1 April 2015
