Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas needs a script writer badly!!
","After watching both trailers of Star War: The Phantom Menace, I was just as hyped as anyone else ready to see this movie. After leaving the theatre I was a little confused. Why was Jar Jar Binks the main attraction in this film? Taking up WAY TO MUCH MOVIE TIME!! The characters really never got a chance to grow on your because Jar Jar was in every damn scene. The interaction between Quon and Obi Wan's characters never clicked for me. Anakin and the princess had a better relationship and depth. Which is good since they will have kids in the future. The special effects, of course, was mind blowing. But the look of a movie is only 1/3 of what a movie needs to be successful. In the original Star Wars, their was lots of drama, humor, anticipation, chemistry with the actors/actresses and action that flowed. Star Wars:TPM seems to be missing a lot of this stuff. The film is definitely aim toward the kiddies, which is a bit confusing since the people who saw the original Star Wars (the true fans) are all in their late 20's and 30's now. The story isn't a terrible one, but it could have been a lot better. It's the dialogue that's bad. With Jar Jar trying to talk in a language we can understand and the rest of the characters going through the motions, the film fails in several areas. Thank the stars that the next Star Wars will be aimed toward the adults. It'll have a darker side to the story. I hope it gets an 'R' rating so we can actually see some bloodshed (Jar Jar Binks getting decapitated would be nice) and adult humor for a change. Not a total waste of film. If your a huge Star Wars fan, you'll have to seen it once. But after that, just wait for it to come to video. I had to sit through the film twice and that was enough for me.",7,0,1,24 July 1999
The Others," Slow, Boring, Not Scary, Slow Boring..You Get The Picture.
","What's really a shame about this movie is that it could (and should) have been a sleeper hit. But because of it's slow pace and lack of any scary jump-out-of-your-seat moments, the film falls to mediocre. The atmosphere was perfect for this film. Located on an abandoned island sits an old manor house with a cemetery next to it. It doesn't get much better then that for a ghostly atmosphere. We learn that Grace and her husband Charles are the owners of the house and live there with their 2 children Anna and Nicholas. The husband had left to fight in the England / German war and has not returned. There are strange rules in the house, which Grace cryptically explains to her new servants are important. Each of the fifty doors in the house must be locked before another can be opened. The curtains must always be drawn. The daylight can actually injured her children and cause swores and burning if they stay in the light to long. Three strangers appear at the door looking for work. Grace had put in an ad for servants to cook and clean the old manor, or did she? Now, with all of this going for it you would expect at least 3-4 scary moments with the first hour, right? WRONG!! Besides some creaking doors and floors, a piano that plays by itself and won't stay locked and a paranoid Grace and her son, there wasn't a single scary moment in the first hour. There are only 2 scenes that will have you jumping out of your seats, and that just isn't enough. I was literally dozing off during this movie and my girlfriend was 'sighing' wondering when something interesting was going to happen. As for the acting, Nicole Kidman did an admirable job, but little Alakina Mann who played the daughter Anna (in her very first movie), literally stole the show. This girl was brilliant. Not only was her dialogue spoken cleaning with precise timing, but her facial emotions were dead on. At times she looked very erie and subdued. Even the little boy who played Nicholas (James Bentley) did a wonderful job. Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), who did an outstanding job in Waking Ned Devine was perfect for this role and showed her acting talent very well. Nope..it wasn't the acting that killed this movie, it was the script.Everyone is calling this a Sixth Sense clone and in some ways, it is. Most people will figure out the twisted ending long before it gets there. I did! If the writer had let the cat out of the bag half way through the movie and then provided a new interaction between the characters, things could have been a bit different. Instead, the solution was told and the movie ended, just like that. Definitely wait for this to hit the video store. If this movie came out back in the 50's or 60's it might have been worth a look, but with everyone expecting a modern day ghost story, the film just doesn't live up to anyones expectation. Take a pass on this and wait for the next haunting movie.",7,0,0,23 August 2001
Blade II," Ohh My!! Blade 2 Is One Bloody Good Sequel.
","I'm not going to write a long review for Blade 2. I just want to say..'SEE IT!!' This sequel is much better then the original, with more fight scenes, more gore, way more vampires and a lot of cool surprises. I was very impressed. Wesley Snipes did a great job reprising his role as the DayWalker. In a recent interview he said he would be happy to do a Blade 3 if the story was decent and other comic book characters we're introduced. So there's a good chance for a sequel. The plot for Blade 2 is about a new breed of vampire that doesn't have any weaknesses. Trying to use silver bullets, garlic, holy water, or crosses just don't work. The only thing that can kill them is sunlight and a stake through the heart (I guess they DO have a couple weaknesses). They are twice as strong and agile as the normal vampire. They also have a heartier (no pun intended) appetite for blood. The Daywalker is teamed up with the BloodPack (group of Vampires that we're trained to terminate the DayWalker) to stop the new breed known as Reapers. The plot isn't anything special, but it keeps the movie moving in the right direction and provides plenty of action along the way. My only disappointment was with some of the cheesy special effects use during the fight scenes. One fight between Blade & Nyssa was partly done in CGI and looked pretty bad. Why wasn't wire-style fighting used instead? More could have been with the plot as well, but what's here isn't terrible.Overall it's a must see movie. If you watched the first Blade and enjoyed it, Blade 2 should be on your list of things to do.",8,0,1,5 April 2002
American Pie," I laughed until my ribs hurt.
","Without a doubt, one of the funniest movies of 1999. I never laughed so hard at a movie since...well since 'There's Something About Mary'. This movie brought back memories of my days of high school romping. Every 5 years a movie like this needs to come out so people can remember what high, school, love, and sex was like when we were young. The acting was actually pretty decent, and these unknown kids did a wonderful job portraying high school teenagers looking for love. Would like to see a sequel with these guys in college. That would be interesting. Go see this movie now, before it leaves the theaters. Nuff said.Ace",9,0,0,22 July 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The Best Film Of 2001 (Oscar Nomination In The Future)
","I'm not going to write a long drawn out review for this film. As you can see, there are plenty of them already in the 'Comments' section. What I want to say is, 'This is without a doubt the BEST FILM of 2001.' Even though there are several other films released this year that deserve an Oscar nod, Lord of the Rings should definitely get a few nominations. The acting in this movie was outstanding. I had to literally check the credits several times to verify that Liv Tyler was Arwen Undomiel. Her whole character and change of voice was mesmerizing to me. I now have respect for her acting talents. Elijah Wood also did a fantastic job. I truly did not think he was right for this part, but he proved me wrong. Sean Astin also did a decent job. The weight gain had me wondering if that was him or not. But the Oscar nomination should definitely go to Ian McKellen for his truly incredible performance. As for the actual movie and story. I was blown away from this great adventure and how it was told. The visual effects were amazing and very well done. There were a few hic-cups here and there with the editing  and special effects, but most of it was flawless. There are a few shocking scenes that may be too much for children 10 and under, but for the most part, this is an excellent family film. I haven't read the J.R.R. Tolkien books, but I will definitely get it and sit it next to the Harry Potter book that I'm trying to finish reading. Great job Peter Jackson and WETA. You've done an incredible job bringing the Lord of the Rings novel to the big screen. I look forward to the next installment.",10,0,0,28 December 2001
The Fast and the Furious," The Title Says It All
","I won't go into a long drawn out review of this film. The Fast and the Furious is just what it means. You have extremely fast sporty cars racing furiously down public streets. The plot is pretty irrelevant, but if you must know, think of this as Point Break on wheels instead of on a surf board and you'll know what I mean. Paul Walker does an admirable job in this flick, but doesn't really sell his character as an undercover cop. True..no one would ever believe he's a real cop, but even when he's acting like a cop, it's not convincing. Vin Diesel does a great job as Dominic Toretto. His deep voice and statured physic fits him perfectly for this role. This guy could be the next Arnold S. with the right script. He was sensational in Pitch Black, and just as good in The Iron Giant (voice of Iron Giant). This guy is going to go far.As for the movie, it was what I expected. Lots of fast cars, crazy chases, sexy women, and timely stunts. The plot is forgettable, but the action will be remembered. If your looking for a drama induced flick with incredible acting and a nail biting plot, you'll have to look elsewhere. But if you want fast cars, fast women and incredible chase scenes, this is the movie for you.",8,1,1,13 July 2001
The Transporter," 90 Mins Of Pure HIGH-Octane Action!!
","I think many critics went to this film expecting something totally different then what this film was trying to be. Critics were actually looking for a quality detailed plot and Oscar winning performances. I can tell you right now that the Director: Luc Besson wasn't even aiming in that direction at all. The actual plot of this movie was definitely an afterthought. I'm not going to bother going into full detail of the plot either, cause everyone who has seen this movie knows what it's about. I want to comment more so on the performance of Jason Statham. Can this former unknown carry an action movie and could he be the next Arnold, Jet Li, Jackie Chan, Bruce Willis or even Vin Diesel? Well..I don't think he's any of them, as he has his own style, but I think he has the potential to be a great action star. While all the other actors are great action stars, most of them can barely act. Vin & Bruce had their moments (Pitch Black & The Sixth Sense), but the others are pure action actors with one line dialogues. I think Jason Statham has charisma, style, personality, wit and the look. He has a unique way of delivering his lines. He does it with coolness and confidence. In the Transporter he does this adamantly and his fighting abilities are pretty awesome as well. People forget that he was in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch and even The One w/Jet Li. He'll be in The Italian Job next.
As for the movie itself, I loved it. I went into the theater expecting continuous action with a small plot to move the story along and that's what I got. I was happy that the producers didn't show ALL of the action scenes in the trailer like many of them like to do. There was still a lot of special effects and stunts that weren't in the trailer. If your bored and need a little excitement in your life get to the theater and see The Transporter. If you want to see an even better action film get Jet Li's FIST OF LEGEND. You won't be disappointed. B-ACE",8,0,0,2 November 2002
Ip Man," Yip Man - Best Martial Art Film In Years
","I've been a martial arts movie fan for years. Every since I was in High School and my friend invited me to check out his Tai-Kwon-Do class, I was fascinated with Asia style martial arts. I eventually joined my friend's class and went as far as Blue Belt before heading off to college and leaving the class. I've seen just about all the best martial arts movies; from Drunken Master 2 to Once Upon a Time In China. Even the classics like 7 Blows of the Dragon and 5 Deadly Venoms. I've seen them all. I have my favorites like Fist of Legend, Wing Chun, The Prodigal Son and Tai Chi Master 1 & 2. What I loved about Yip Man was the well written story the accompanied the great action. Yip Man tells the story of Ip Man who was the first Wing-Chun Master to teach Westerners this style. He was Bruce Lee's first Master. His teachings popularized martial arts in American and started a chain reaction on various martial arts schools throughout America.The movie is a biopic of Ip Man's life in Fo Shan China where he lived and taught his style. Fo Shan in 1930 was know for it's martial arts schools and one could be found on just about every corner. Yip Man did not have students, but would occasional be challenged by other masters interested in learning from him. Yip Man would fight them behind closed door, so if they lose, they would not be disrespected or humiliated by their peers or students. This was Yip Man way and he was well respected throughout Fo Shan.What turn things around in Fo Shan was the Sino Japanese war that appeared in Fo Shan. The Japanese Imperial army took over Fo Shan and even took Yip Man's home away from him. They treated the Chinese people with no respect and had them working for less then minimal wages. At this time Yip Man is barely able to feed his family and takes up work shoveling coal. All of Fo Shan people were at the mercy of the Japanese army. The armies' Generatl Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi) would have Li Zhao (Lam Ka Tung), who was the translator and liaison between the Japanese and Chinese, find fighters to battle Japanese soldiers for rice. If the Chinese fighter won, he would get a bag of rice for every man he defeated. It's safe to say that Yip Man himself eventually gets his turn, but not very willingly.The fights in this film are sensational. With Sammo Hung and Tony Leung Siu Hung overseeing all the action, you know it has to be great. Some of the best action is when Jin Shan Zhao (Siu-Wong Fan) comes to Fo Shan to open his own martial arts school. He challenges all the masters to make sure he's the best in Fo Shan. The action, technique and martial arts skill are intense. Nothing is held back. Donnie Yen's Yip Man is awesome. A humbled man who enjoys the quiet life, yet loves to train and practice the Wing Chun style. His Wing Chun style is fast, soft and mainly a defensive style. The Wing Chun style was created by a woman. Even Yip Man's stance and how he holds his hands represents a woman's posture. It's not hard or stiff like Karate or Tae-Kwon-Do. When Yip Man fights some of his opponents he spends the 1st few minutes simply defending, blocking and diverting the oncoming blows. When he strikes however, it's lightning fast and direct. It's wonderful to watch.This is a must have film. I just finished watching Yip Man 2 on DVD, which is almost as good as this film. The story isn't as well written and character development isn't as strong, but Sammo Hung is in it this time. He's great as usual. Still worth seeing though. In any case Yip Man should be seen by every martial arts fan. It's definitely in my Top 10 along with Drunken Master 2, Fist of Legend, Once Upon A Time In China & Tai Chi Master. Do not hesitate to get this film. Overall I rate this movie 9/10.",9,1,2,29 May 2010
Toy Story 2," You Got A Friend In Me
","Disney does it again. Unlike the sequel to Aladdin, Toy Story 2 shines brightly as one of the best (if not thee best) animation films of the century. The first Toy Story was fabulous, but Toy Story 2 not only improves on the story, character, and lessons of life, but also gives us better visuals than the first movie. The animation of the Toy Store owner, the dog, and the mother was absolutely wonderful, as well as ALL the other characters in the film. Even the short story about the Lamp icon before the movie was brilliantly done. Pixar will be receiving more awards for this film.Going back to Woody's roots and having Buzz try to save him this time around was a nice welcome. I was happy to see all the voice actors came back because the movie just wouldn't have been the same without Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles and the others. Even Joan Cusack did a fabulous job as Jessie the wild cowgirl. This is a must see film for kids and adults alike. I couldn't find any flaws in the film at all. A perfect 10 if you ask me. This will be a HOT seller when it hits DVD and VHS formats. It could win an Oscar if the Academy is wise enough to put it on the ballot. Great job Pixar/Disney!!",10,0,1,17 December 1999
The Hurricane," Hit's You Like A Hurricane
","There's only one word to describe this movie. OUTSTANDING!! If you think your going to see a boxing movie, your gravely mistaken. If you want to see a plain boxing movie go see 'Play It To The Bone'. If you want an emotional, incredibly acted, entertaining film about a boxer life and the trials and turmoils he went through to prove his innocents, see 'THE HURRICAE'. Denzel once again surprises no one by portraying Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter perfectly. Rubin, an incredible boxer who's born in a time of racial surroundings and unfair justice, has to live in jail for most of his life due to a prejudice Police Sargeant. What follows is a touching tale of a young boy and his 3 white adult friends who dedicate their life in freeing the wrongly accused boxer. This is one of the best written and told biographies I've seen in awhile. Even the real Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter was moved and impressed by its authenticity and Denzel Washingtons portrayal. In a press interview Mr. Carter stated that no one else could have play him as well as Denzel Washington did. That's a huge compliment coming from a strong willed man as Carter. Go and see this movie. You won't regret one single minute.",9,0,1,22 January 2000
The Happening," It Didn't Happen.
","I'd have to say that it's really sad to see M. Night Shyamalan career take a nose dive. After doing the brilliant 'The Sixth Sense', M. Night's movies have slowly gotten worse and worse. 'Unbreakable' was very good as well, but not as good as 'The Sixth Sense'. Then came 'Signs' with Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix, which was also good, but probably not as good as 'Unbreakable'. The Village was so predictable, it wasn't funny. It wasn't scary and only have a few moments of intense thrills. I was disappointed. Even Jaoquin Phoenix presence couldn't save that movie. 'Lady in the Water' was worse. I still have yet to watch this movie from beginning to end. Now we get the Happening. There are so many things wrong with this film it isn't funny. I'm not going to point out everything, just the things I think are critical.1) The Script: It's completely horrendous. The idea of plants sending out defensive poisons in the air that causes people to kill themselves and others is a bit much. The main problem though is there isn't enough detail given in the beginning or at the end of the movie that tells us what plants are causing this terrible phenomenon. There are theories thrown around, but never any proof that the trees, grass or other plants is causing this effect. It could have been the birds or some other animals releasing some toxin in the air. Who knows? There's no buildup to a definitive answer. There's not even a conclusion. There wasn't even any twist, which M.Nights movies are known for.2) Characters/Acting: Absolutely no character development in this film. The only one you really feel for is the little girl. Even though 3 months after losing her parents, she's fine leaving with teachers. The only actors who given any kind of descent performance is Zooey Deschanel and Betty Buckley. It's too bad their talents are wasted on this film. Mark Wahlberg's performances goes from good to terrible by the time the film ends. I was hoping the deadly wind would finally get him. Still, you really don't care about any of the people in this film. We just don't know enough about them to care. So many people die so suddenly, that viewers only concern is how the terror can be stopped (and how did it begin).3) No Drama/Suspense/Action - The movie is pretty boring. There is very little suspense or drama, and almost no action. With a film like this, you want to be on the edge of you seat, but I was almost on my feet ready to walk out. M. Night's direction doesn't draw you into his vision. Too many questions go on unanswered even after the movie ends. Why didn't the deadly wind effect Elliott, Alma or Jess, yet it effected Mrs. Jones? What caused it to suddenly stop? Why didn't it effect the West coast or other countries? Were any of the people who were effected examined? I would think the brain would be the first thing to get examined. Why wasn't the government more involved? The CIA/FBI would have been on this in a heartbeat.Anyways, 'The Happening' just wasn't happening. It's definitely M.Night's worse movie to date. Next up is, 'The Last Airbender' based off 'The Avatar' books and anime. It can't be any worse then this movie, that's for sure.I gave 'The Happening' 3 stars. Do not buy or rent this movie.",3,2,4,13 March 2010
Glory Road," Outstanding!! Who Ever Heard Of Texas Western
","After reading several reviews on this site, people need to realize that this movie is 'BASED' on a true story. Which basically means, not everything is going to be completely ACCURATE. People need to stop reviewing the movie on accuracy and everything being a FACT. There has never been a movie made that was truly and complete accurate. NEVER!! So stop trying to review this movie on facts. No one cares if Kentucky was trailer by 11 points in the championship.Glory Road is an excellent telling of the 1966 Texas Western NCAA Championship win against Kentucky. It's true that Don Haskins didn't win the championship his first year. Because of the recruiting budget he decided to venture northeast to the playgrounds of New York & Philadephia and recruit prominent black players to play for Texas Western. These players had to struggle with not only a tough coach, but also racism, other players and a new surrounding. For people to say that these players didn't face what was shown in the film, are either idiots or were born in the 80's and don't have a clue. There is still racism TODAY in Texas and other southern states.The movie does an excellent job of showing what the coach and players had to go through to reach the final championship game. Whether each game was accurate point for point is irrelevant, as the story is more about the team and the coach, and not really each game that was played. Even though some of the players weren't professional actors, I thought this did an admirable job portraying there counterparts. Josh Lucas was excellent as the hard nosed Don Haskins who gave strong leadership to the boys. I thought they could have done more with Emily Deschanel role as Don Haskin's wife. They also should have showed Don Haskin's first 4 yrs and what the team was like prior to all the recruiting.There is no doubt that this Texas Western team paved the road for the black players of today. True, other college teams had 1-2 black players on their team back in 1966, but most of them were just tokens at the time, and saw very little playing time, if any at all. There had never been 5 black starters. Yes, teams had won championships with black players on the team, but never with 5 starting and playing the whole game. That was the point. Back in 1966, most southern state coaches didn't believe black players were athletic or intelligent enough to play at the college basketball level. Texas Western proved these coaches wrong. Now more then 75% of the NBA are minority (black, Asian, hispanic, etc.) players.Who Ever Heard Of Texas Western? I hadn't until now. Now everyone knows.",9,1,9,28 January 2006
The Green Mile," A Sheer Masterpiece. An Automatic Oscar Nomination
","I'm not going to make any long comments on this incredible film. I can only say one thing, SEE IT!! a very moving poetic film that will have you teary eye and bewildered all at the same time.

The Iron Giant," This Iron Giant Will Touch Your Heart And Move Your Soul
","What a wonderful story this cartoon tells. The Iron Giant tells the tale of a young boy who comes in contact with a Giant Robot from outer space. As the robot is trying to feed himself with powerline girders, he's tangled up in the live wired and unable to escape. The frightened boy (Huglow Hughes) rescues him. What follows from that point is true friendship, lessons of war, anger, parenthood, and the bound between a boy a Giant Robot with incredible capabilities. This movie is great family entertainment and should be seen with your kids or parents. Basing this story in the 1950's was a great idea, since war was just itching to happen and people didn't really have a whole lot back then. A little boy and his Mother just getting by in a small town of Roswell, ME really shows that adventure and the love of life can be found anywhere you go. The seen with the deer dying and the explanation of guns killing people were right on target. Yes, guns don't kill people. People kill people, but with GUNS. The NRA may not like this movie, but the fact that it shows parents and kids alike that guns can cause violence and bad things to happen is perfect in this day in age. The movie isn't very long, but the message it gives is worth the time of seeing it. Rent this movie if you missed it in the theater.",9,1,2,21 October 1999
Signs," Better Then Unbreakable, But Not Scary.
","Well..I'll have to say I liked this better then Unbreakable. I thought Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix did an excellent job acting in this movie. I do believe the movie was a little misleading, as most people thought this movie would be about crop signs, but instead it was more about a family becoming stronger and a man believing in fate and his faith. The humor and suspense pretty much carried this movie through. They worked hand and hand, and kept you wondering what would happen next. (*Spoilers*) Once the alien was shown though, the suspense wasn't as high and I think the audience really wanted to see what was happening outside and around the town. The ending left a lot of things unexplained. Why did the aliens come and what had happen around the world. We only know that water hurt them and the military drove them away. The movie was still entertaining. I don't think it was boring (see The Time Machine..now that's boring). Thought there could have been more to the story then what was provided. Definitely worth a look.",9,0,1,14 August 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The Best Trilogy Since Stars Wars & Godfather
","First of all, for the people who are bashing this film and giving it 1's & 2's, please delete your User Id's from IMDB website as you are not a true movie fan. If you truly think the LOTR series was bad, then please (pretty please) show me how YOU could make the movie better. That's what I thought. On with my short review.The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King is without a doubt the best conclusion of any trilogy movie I've ever scene. Even better then the last Star Wars movie in different ways. Not only is the story extremely well told and acted, but the whole cinematography is absolutely breath-taking. The lighting and shadow effects are beautifully done and the camera work is some of the best I've seen in long time. This movie should get at least 5 Oscars and maybe 9-10 nominations. The Academy have snubbed movies like this again and again each year even though critics have screamed praises for it. LOTR:ROTK definitely deserve some awards this year.Many people have complained about the endings being too long or not authentic with the book. To them I say =oP!! Give it a rest. I thought the endings were very well done. The various cut scenes could have been smoothed together a bit better, but overall the ending(s) were fine. I would have liked to have seen endings for Gimli & Legolas as well, but what was provided was good enough. There's no doubt that this final movie will be a huge success when the DVD is released.Unlike the Matrix Trilogy the went from great to bad, LOTR when from great to stellar. Peter Jackson definitely deserves recognition for all this hard work with these 3 films. I say, 'Bravo!!' to him and his staff on bringing the LOTR Trilogy to life on the big screen. I'm sure Peter J. will be sought out by every movie studio from now on.If you haven't see this movie yet, don't walk, but RUN to the theater and see it NOW. Nuff said!!",10,0,0,22 December 2003
Cube," Intensely Suspenseful Thriller. Hitchcock Would Be Proud.
","Where do I start trying to explain one of the most original films I've ever scene. It's always a pleasure to view a low-budget film that excels in different areas and becomes a cult following. Cube not only touches your psyche, but also keeps you on the edge and makes you ask many questions along the way and even after the film is over. The movie simply throws you into the plot with no explanation as to how the people got into this giant cube or why. Even the characters don't truly know why they are there or who put them there. Most of them simply know that they were doing something prior to waking up in this cube. That along is a scary thought. All they know is that there is danger in some of the adjacent rooms that can instantly kill them. Some of them have already seen the traps and survived. As the small society discusses their options and there reasons for being there, they soon discover that each person holds a knowledgeable key for escaping. With no food or water, time isn't on their side and only a strong body, mind and the will to live will keep them moving toward their goal of escaping. To tell you much more about the film would totally ruin the surprises and there are many surprises along the way. Some of them are shocking, while others are questionable. The ending is a bit of a shocker and many viewers will be scratching their heads and staring at the screen in awe. This film definitely deserves a sequel and one was actually made called Hypercube. From the reviews I've read, it's basically the same as the first film with different characters and a few twists. None of the questions are answered from the first film, so maybe there will be a 3rd sequel in the near future that will explain EVERYTHING. That would be nice. Listen to what the other reviewers have said about this film and then go out and rent it. You have to see this film at least once. It's totally original and the script was very well written. The actors actually do a decent job even though most of them don't show much depth or chemistry.
Overall the movie is a suspenseful thrill ride that's worth viewing. You'll never know what's going to happen next. There are times when the film drags alone with not much happening, but confrontations seem to be around every corner. Let's hope a 3rd film is made that will clear up questions about the CUBE and all it's mysteries.",8,0,1,28 September 2002
The Bourne Supremacy," Someone Take Me Off This Roller Coaster
","The Bourne Supremacy is a decent movie that's really only tainted by the poor camera work and some missing additional action. I'm not going to get too involved with the story, since I'm sure someone else has already explained the plot. A short summary is that Jason Bourne is being framed for killing to agents in Berlin. The Secret Service is out to bring him in or terminate him. Jason has to travel all around the globe trying to track people down to prove his innocence. Even though there are some intense chase scenes throughout various international countries, what kills the beautiful action is the closeness of the camera. In every action scene, even the hand to hand combat, the camera is right on top of the actors. The fight between Jason and an old agent in his apartment is totally ruined because the camera is two feet away from them. At times it appears that the camera is in the fight as well, as he falls down and the camera bounces all over the place. Even the car chases, which usually show the action from close, medium and long distances, is constantly right next to the car. There are times when all you see is the front end and tire. Want to see good car chase camera work, watch 'Gone in 60secs.' Even check out the trailer for 'Taxi' (starring Queen Latifah). That's how car chase scenes should be filmed.Besides this problem, the movie is pretty decent. Even though the plot is predictable, the end result isn't. All the actors do a great job in this film. Joan Allen is great as Pamela Landy and Matt Damon is perfect as the hard nosed take no prisoners Jason Bourne. I was looking forward to a bit more martial arts fighting, but it really didn't come.There is already talks of a third (and probably final) movie. Bourne Supremacy had a high opening of $51 million, which is nothing to sneeze at. Meanwhile Halley Barry's Catwoman only made $17 million. Is The Bourne Supremacy worth seeing. Sure, but sit way in the back, as sitting up close will make you dizzy.",7,0,1,29 July 2004
