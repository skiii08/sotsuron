The Blair Witch Project," Saw it at the time...
","And was creeped out by it. I'd heard the truth about the film before seeing it, so I knew it was a fake...However, the backstory given by interviews in the first part of the film, and then watching those interviews unfold were what MADE this film so unsettling. The final scene had me a bit haunted for days (probably because I had paid attention to what was said at the beginning).It didn't help that I walked home in pitch dark New England fog, either.BWP is an intentional mind-screw (since we're not allowed profanity). Rather than be the traditional hack and slash horror film, it's a horror movie that concentrates on the breakdown of the human mind in a situation of fear and panic.Are the characters idiots for getting lost? Yes. Do you want to throttle them for being morons? Heck yeah. But their descent from somewhat annoying, but intelligent, inquisitive people into complete paranoia within a matter of days is what is so chilling.The impact has lessened on subsequent viewings- but the lack of gore is brilliant, in my mind. Your mind has the freedom to take the images and run with them as wildly as it wants.If you don't have the patience to watch the entire thing, just make sure you watch the beginning (interviews) and the end (the house), and just absorb it. This movie makes you think to get it. 8/10",Null,0,1,17 August 2004
Mission: Impossible III," Middle of the road
","I'm not a huge fan of Tom Cruise, particularly in light of his recent limelight antics. I have to admit I was not too excited to see MI:3 at all.On that note, I was pleasantly surprised. It was slightly less 'Tom Cruise playing Tom Cruise... imitating some sort of a character' than I expected. Cruise's characters never quite break too far from one another. But in this case, the character was shallow. So... no harm, no foul.As others have mentioned, the plot seemed shallow to me. I think a large part of the problem lies in Hoffman's villain. He's simply not quite dark or deep enough to be believable to me to make this movie work correctly. The movie sets him out to be one of those 'invisible' masterminds of the underworld, but we never truly see his underworld, nor his invisibility.The other problem is with the Rabbit's Foot itself. Sure-- we get that it has a bio-hazard label on it. Which means it's probably some dirty bomb, in light of current political climate fears. But other than by name (and a visible image of the cannister), we don't know what the Rabbit's Foot is. Nor are we given a reason to care about its broader implications to mankind. Overall, it was a popcorn flick. A harmless, kick back for an action movie type movie. Not that great, but not horrible, either.",5,1,2,8 May 2006
Shaun of the Dead," Refreshing movie to end the summer
","I caught a sneak preview for the American release-- a week after seeing Resident Evil, no less -- and have to say that I was extremely impressed. Contrary to claims that Americans won't 'get it,' the humor is quite easy to understand (and honestly uses a lot of the same slang we use here in the States). The dialogue was a bit tough to hear at first (possibly a theater speaker problem), but otherwise accents are easy to understand.For the zombie movie fan, it's a treat. Lots of little references to the original Dead films and even a couple amusing references to 28 Days Later. It has the perfect blend of intelligent wit and downright silly humor to make it a fun Friday night popcorn flick. In my top five for the year.8.5 out of 10.",9,1,3,20 September 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Fun ride :)
","When I first heard that this was coming out, I rolled my eyes at the title-- great... Disney trying to make yet more money on things they had well-established in Disneyland.  Yeah, fine, whatever. I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised.  This movie is a fun little ride-- not fantastic or amazing, but enjoyable.  Johnny Depp is amazing in characterizing this pirate-- is he drunk?  Is he crazy? Or is Jack Sparrow just pretending to be that way?  He keeps up the act through the entire movie, which is a feat in its own right. So sit back and be entertained.  It's not earthshattering, but a good little pirate adventure for a couch movie night.",8,0,1,18 December 2003
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Pretty, but something lacking
","My fianc√© and I saw Narnia on opening weekend. Visibly, I thought it was a beautiful film. But something was missing in the plot-- it seemed too superficial and rushed to me. Granted, I haven't read the book in twenty years, so it's possible that the children would become instant friends with a lion they'd never met. Or perhaps it's just my adult mind looking at a childhood story where it doesn't seem plausible anymore. Plus, the 'main characters' (being the children) didn't seem important as leads at all. They were just sort of... there.Tilda Swinton was wonderful as the White Witch. She has such a unique beauty about her that can go from elegant to fierce evil with just a change of expression. She sold me.I could see it being a fun movie to take the elementary age group children. But as adults, it was just okay and won't be on my DVD purchase list.There's something lacking in this movie... and I just can't figure out what it was...",5,9,16,14 December 2005
The Expendables," Exactly what it should have been
","Sometimes you just need a mindless, violent action flick where the names of the characters and locations don't matter at all. The Expendables fills that role perfectly. Walking in, you know it's going to be cheesy macho violence with a shaky plot - but that's not the point of these types of movies. The point is the completely impossible plot line, the violent ways in which people die, and the lineup of action stars who have horrendous dialog where you just laugh, toss some more kernels of popcorn in your mouth, and elbow your friend in the seat next to you with some crass jokes.The people who expected any semblance of a good plot missed the point of this movie - it's supposed to be stupid and over the top. The dialog is supposed to be bad. Relish a bad movie for the sake of all of its badness and watch the phrase 'so bad it's good' unfold on screen. Relax, laugh, groan, and wince - it's part of the 80s action movie experience.My only critique was that I wish I would have seen a bit more - of everything and everyone. 9.5 of 10.",9,3,12,15 August 2010
The Matrix Revolutions," So... who wrote the cheesy fanfic?
","I kept waiting for the outlined heads of Tom Servo, Crow, and Mike to come in from the right side of the screen.  Mystery Science Theater would have a field day with the dialogue in this.My friends and I went to the theater expecting very little, based on the second movie.  We hoped to be entertained, have some fun, but had no hope in anything of blast-me-away quality, or even anything good.We were entertained-- like the rest of the audience, we were laughing at how sappy the dialogue was, and how incredulous these characters had become in their shallowness.  'The Scene' (discussed more than once in comments here) between Trinity and Neo was beyond belief in its sap quality.  I've read better romantic X-Files fanfics written by teenage girls than this.  One of my friends coined it best-- 'Excuse me, hi.. Neo?  Yeah... could you wiggle one of those poles a bit so we can get this scene over with and get through the rest of the movie?  Thanks.'I have to be reminded why Morpheus or Trinity are even in this movie- what exactly do they *do*?  What purpose do they serve? Scenes that could evoke horror in human beings-- the fields of humans being grown (so emphasized in first movie as an image that haunted Morpheus) could have added such impact.  But they're barely seen in the distance, and reactions from Neo and Trinity are negligible at best.I could care less about any of the other characters.  To be honest, I didn't know the names of the humans of Zion as I left the theater.There was nothing to like, nothing to relate to.Sure, some of the graphics were fantastic, and at times even beautiful to watch-- but I didn't come to the movie to watch a lot of amazing CGI graphics.  I can get that with video games at my house these days.It's sad, because I enjoyed the first movie on so many levels. Those levels are completely gone with this movie.What a waste of my sleep time last night.2/10.  (one point for the CGI)",1,0,0,6 November 2003
Alien vs. Predator," Had promise, but fell short
","** Spoilers **Another reviewer has called it junk food for the brain-- and I thinkthat's pretty accurate.  As a sci-fi movie (forgetting the franchises)on a hot summer afternoon, it was fun.  A short escape fromreality.But it really wasn't an Alien or a Predator movie in my mind.  Theyjust happened to show up in the movie.I found the concept of the backstory interesting, and saw a LOT ofpotential there.  What would make Predators (always establishedas coming to hunt in hot weather) come to the ice?  Theconnection between pyramids on earth between different cultures,etc. -- all interesting little background info to make it just believableenough.But a movie that advertises itself as Aliens vs. Predator should beABOUT Aliens vs. Predators.  It seemed like the battles betweenthe two races were too brief, and too far between (an editingproblem, I imagine).One of the things, particularly in Aliens, that makes the movie sofantastic is that you care about the characters.  It makes theirdeaths that much more effective and impacting.  Here, thecharacters are barely introduced.  A couple don't even havenames.  There is no development of character, no connectionbetween them-- no real reason to care about them at all. 
A lot of the problems I attribute to the way-too-fast run time of themovie.  Things that needed to be developed to solidify the plot justcould not be accomplished in the movie that was released. 
However, some sloppy story writing-- within the movie itself-- alsomakes it, as a member of the Aliens or Predator franchises,subpar.  For example, after multiple scans by the Predator to findan alien growing within hosts, bypassing killing a main characterbecause he's old, sick, and weak, etc-- you want to have mebelieve that his shipmates would not have scanned his dead bodybefore bringing it onboard their ship?  Riiight.Again-- for a generic sci-fi romp, it was okay.  Needed more action,needed a lot more time to develop the storyline and make me careabout it-- but the name is misleading for what was produced.7/10.",Null,1,2,16 August 2004
Hero," Beautiful framing...
","While not a usual fan of Chinese movies, I did enjoy this film.  The story itself rang a bit hollow for me-- but as I am not Asian, I accept that I might not 'get' all of the nuances of the film.I found it visually stunning.  Beautiful work with colors to represent perception.  The fight scenes in the rain and swirling leaves were the most memorable to me. This was not a kung fu movie, as many going to see it here in the US might think (and therefore be disappointed when they see it).  It is epic mythology-- much like the story of Troy... a real historical event embellished with larger than life figures, finishing off with moral lessons.  It was not the best film that I've ever seen, but not the worst, either.  I enjoyed it.  7/10.",7,0,0,30 August 2004
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Felt disgusting walking out
","Having read the book many times, I was excited to see that Burton was taking on an interpretation of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. He was the perfect director to give a movie the dark edge that was in the novel, yet keep some of the playful imagination that made it a kids' book.Unfortunately, what I saw on screen was extremely disappointing. From the silence during the movie and the hushed whispers afterward, I wasn't alone.The good things about this movie: the great glass elevator was used (and was wonderful). The nut room scene was amusing. And the chocolate river was perfect. But the rest of the factory and sets were just... eh.Charlie was convincing as the good-natured boy who cared for his family, but the other children didn't make me believe their roles. Violet's mother seemed like she was still stuck playing her role in Galaxy Quest. And sadly, Depp's Wonka struck me as entirely too Michael Jackson-ish. So much so, that it instinctively forced me from wanting to enjoy the movie.Quite, quite sad... because I love Burton's work and Depp's amazing acting skills. If they were going for disturbing shock value, I guess they succeeded. But I remember enjoying the book and the dreams and fantasy within the dark undertones... and that just wasn't here.",3,1,4,31 July 2005
