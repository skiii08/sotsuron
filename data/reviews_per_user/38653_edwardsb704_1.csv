Angels & Demons," Zillion dollar cast for Inferno, sequel to Angels& Demons
","Proposed zillion dollar cast for Inferno, next in the Dan Brown's Langdon franchise; Langdon - Tom Hanks, Dr.Sienna Brooks - Jennifer Lawrence, Vayentha - Rooney Mara, Bruder - Gerard Butler, Bertrand Zobrist - Mads Mikkelsen, The Provost - Robert De Niro, Dr.Sinskey - Helen Mirren, FS-2080 - Alexander Skarsg√•rdI couldn't think of anyone else who would do justice to reform this epic yarn into an Epic film. Couldn't think of anyone to take the place of pregnant Marta and the character Knowlton. The placing of the film is awesomely rich in history, and could not have been any better. And the tale is spun in a trade mark Dan Brown fashion, which keeps you keep turning page after page, and will definitely keep the movie goers on the edge of their seats, for sure. :-D",10,1,3,24 December 2013
