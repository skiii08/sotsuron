Requiem for a Dream," Enter The Sandman, But Only Once....
","This is a great movie in which Darren Aronofsky continues his very individualistic style of editing and direction, but in a completely different way than he did in Pi.

Although, the pool hall settings and Scorsese's direction make it a whole lot cooler than a movie about bingo. Scorsese's direction has never been better or more unselfconscious. The camera work is beautiful and intricate, but it never distract's your attention from the movie itself.Frankly, this movie is just cool, very entertaining and highly re-watchable. Everything from the performances to the music is just the way it should be. Enjoy.",9,0,0,16 April 2006
