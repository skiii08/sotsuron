Skyfall," Few words review...
","The film is what you expect from a 007 movie... Nothing more nothing less and it just gets boring. Action, drama, a bit of humor and that's about it. 6/10, its exactly just above average. The acting is good enough but Bond, has lost his quality, his class, his savior of the world attitude and thats a really BAD thing... And where are the cool gadgets of his??? The crazy cars? They just throw them out the window in this one. So.. Things are missing and things are changed but in the other hand for me 007 was a dying franchise anyway. My verdict is, quite watchable movie for what it is some action before you go to sleep...",6,4,9,16 February 2013

","The movie spams all the past to your face with no shame.
Now i'm gonna judge this for what it is, a Spielberg high production movie.
So with that in mind the movie is a 5/10 at BEST.
I never cared for the characters and the movie never tried to make me do so, plot is ok but still not what it could be.
By the end of the movie i was just waiting for the movie to be done, which is never a good thing.Usualy a good movie EVEN if i don't care from the start it manages to grab me at the end, this one did none of those very weak characters and just a typical hollywood acting, nothing to remember in the long run. My advice is, watch when you are bored and from some streaming service or rent, this is not worth any purchase.",5,0,1,9 June 2018
