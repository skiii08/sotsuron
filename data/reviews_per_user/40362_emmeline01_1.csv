Marie Antoinette," I was waiting for this
",I happened to see the previews for this movie at the movie theater. The previews came later to my cable box. I was delighted. I actually missed the movie in theaters and cursed myself. I was delighted again when this movie came to the town where I live. I thought I'd like the film based on the punk rock music angle used and the costumes. I wasn't disappointed in that respect. I love the scene where whatever his name is seduces Marie to the music of Adam Ant!!!! Hilirious!!! I can see why people say the movie lacked. I suppose it did but I didn't go to the film with the thought that I were going to view a PBS recreation drama. I'd leave that up to PBS. I go to movies to escape my hum drum life and this film succeeded in that regard. If you want to know the 'facts' pick up an encyclopedia or look on Wipekedia they'll fill you in.The only negative thing I can say about the movie is that the dialogue was sketchy in that it was spoken in such a hush that most average people couldn't hear it. I know that was done for effect but I found it annoying that I KNEW most people couldn't hear what was being said during the eating scenes.,Null,0,0,25 January 2007
