Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Nice !!!
","This film is action, adventure and fantasy. According to me, it contains comedy, too. The players and the workers in the making process are so successful that they made a great movie like that. Apart from these, the special effects make the film spectacular, so the spectators can watch the movie pleasurably. The plot is when Jack (Johnny Depp) crosses paths with a woman from his past (Penelope Cruz), he's not sure if it's love or if she's a ruthless con artist who's using him to find the fabled Fountain of Youth. When she forces him aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, the ship of the formidable pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane), Jack finds himself on an unexpected adventure in which he doesn't know who to fear more: Blackbeard or the woman from his past. The other thing is that Jack (Johnny) is a great actor. The film has so perfect scenes, effects and sounds. You will feel like you are in this situation. Thus, my comment will be positive and I suggest all of you to watch it. Be sure, you will like it.",8,0,1,29 May 2012

In this film, you can find things that in your life, for instance, the patient who is cancer and his cure process and his getting rid of cancer, except from this, there is a woman who is so helpful.
