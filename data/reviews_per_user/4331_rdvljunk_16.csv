Blade Runner 2049," Very descent indeed
","As die-hard blade runner fan (I was blown away when it was in the theaters) I of course had to see this movie. However I admit I did not expect too much from it. The trailers were to me uninspiring and critics reviews I read also not too positive. So I prepared myself for a long, but not too exciting, sit. I was pleasantly surprised however. The movie managed to capture me from the start and kept my attention. It has an interesting story line with some nice surprises in the plot, which of course I will not give away. But also some holes in it like how did K know when/where Deckard would be moved? Now I also directly admit it can't compete with the original Blade Runner. It is a very descent sequel, absolutely, but it lacks the more almost claustrophobic and tense atmosphere from the original. Specially the scene's where Deckard is on the crowded streets (The Zhora chase is stunning) are dearly missed in this movie. It has more distance, it is cleaner, less detailed. Compare the apartment of Deckard with K's, The office of Tyrell with that of Wallace, the office of Bryant to that of Joshi, etc. Basically that sums it up when it comes to atmosphere. Together with the soundtrack which is less intense BR 2049 simply can't match up, though good as it is. It is absolute fun to recognize the sometimes hidden references to the original. Some music notes that it based upon/or edited from the original, some scenes, The fact that a dutch actress plays the bad 'guy' in this case, hooker Mariette who clearly resembles Priss, etc.Again we see a movie that is not valued for the high quality it has, but this time I do not expect a cult status. It is in the details.",8,0,5,28 October 2017
Come and See," not the everyday warmovie
","Come and see is a movie that grasps you by the throat and make you see war is not Heroic as many of the western/Hollywood movies seem to portray it. Of course, being a 1985 Soviet movie, it will put in some propagandistic elements and simple elements and sometimes poor acting. But also symbolism that sometimes will not be understood. What is this stork doing in the movie and why is it relevant we ask ourselves (e.g. a Russian friend explained me once that woodpecker ticking on a house means someone from the house will die soon). Not to mention that storks usually do not live in a forest, let alone build a nest on the ground.What we are to believe from most western WWII movies is that is was, at least at the front, a pretty clean and honest fight. With hero's, bad guys and action. This movie shows that on the eastern front things were much different. Question is why this was so, was it that the Russians themselves were not like western soldiers/civilians and the Germans took the same approach? One of the most shocking parts in the movie is when the boy returns home with his girl after being bombarded in a camp. They sit and eat before they realize what is wrong. But also the actions of the Germans in the other village are shocking and we are engulfed with the fear of the people.No this is not a fun movie but it is a class apart from many other WWII movies.",9,2,2,10 May 2014
Sucker Punch," absolutely confusing
","I do like movies in which reality gets mixed up and so I also came to see this one. And as many others I'm totally confused after watching it; It is an amazing spectacle but is it total garbage or is it a great movie, I really do not know. The absolute weird things of the movie, like the casting of apparently botoxed Emily Browning as baby doll, seems to be a big mistake, but on the other side it fits very well because the movie is in many cases so totally overdone, like the imagery which sometimes reminds of a music video clip and often focuses on details, the bizarre soundtrack, the acting. So then I came to the conclusionit must have been on purpose and the movie is more a parody on the sexy girls with weapons movies then it tries to fit in. So depending on what you expected in this movie you will be either disappointed or flabbergasted. If like movies that confuse you, it is a recommendation. If you want a simplistic mindless evening, better avoid it.",8,0,1,4 May 2013
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," can I have a big laugh
","OK we all know star wars isn't the most intelligent type of movie. 1000's of star troops run out of doors just to be slaughtered by the rebels laser-beams, and they just keep coming like lemmings,...you would expect a little combat training for armies, but no, not in star wars. And yes we know. The real hero's are never really hit even if they walk through crossfires of laser-beams. no problem. But come on, it has to be a little bit real. When one of the side kicks is hit/killed his side-kick friend runs towards him from his cover screaming noooo. And suddenly no-one seems to be able to hit this person until the hit side kick has uttered his last heroic words. And what is it with star-wars, that they always have these very important switches on weird places that have to be changed before the hero's can do something. And of course they hero knows exactly what to do when the system states the antenna needs to be aligned. And the pilot that needed to go insane because of the interrogation by a weird creature is amazingly keeping his sense very well.There are so many bad story lines/plots and dialogues in this episode, it becomes beyond ridiculous.",3,8,14,28 December 2016
Constantine," very basic stuff, but Tilda Swinton is worth watching
","What this movie made clear was that Keenau Reeves is far, far away from even Tilda Swinton's shadow when it comes to acting. The role of Neo in the Matrix was more or less written for him, but it is actually all he can and in this movie it is out of its palce and annoying. Rachel Weisz, who played a great role in the constant garderner in the same year is total flat out and uninspired. This movie is however rescued by the (too few) appearances of Tilda Swinton as Gabriel gone mad. She puts al lot of fun in the role, you see she enjoys it and she sparkles from the screen. 
Now I have to admit the scipt doesn't allow the actors to really excell, all is pretty basic and predictable. Ofcourse Constantine will sacrifice himself to go to heaven. But the holes in the script are also obvious... if Isabel sacrificed herself by commiting suicide, why is she in hell if constantine goes to heaven for the same deed?
Well there are some silly demon attacks, we get some ugly make-up, holy water saves the day in some moments and well thats about it.",5,2,4,6 January 2018
Pacific Rim," Transformers meet Godzilla meet independence day
","With Pan's Labyrith Del Torro gave us an amazing fairytale, With Hellboy we were amused by the fatalistic/sarcastic main character. But with Pacific Rim del Torro completely lost it. I guess that is what you get when Hollywood pumps in too much money. It was so predictable that I could only laugh, and I also laughed at the stupid dialogs, and I laughed at the stupid explanation of where the monsters came from. And the funny twists were not funny at all, a toilet being at the right place and a monster comes to live once more to...OK no spoilers. The characters were thin and sometimes even ridiculous. Why did Del Torro let himself in with a script like this, he showed he can make fantastic movies? I'm wondering where to put this movie on the 21st century low list, between 2012 and Avatar I guess, at the bottom of this list",2,1,2,29 July 2014
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Mentioning of Dumbledore twice doesn't make it Harry Potter
","Why was this movie made? I really do not know. More money from the Harry Potter success, milking the cow? Did the American public need a Harry Potter style movie on their soil? For sure it wasn't to make a good story, because if there is something this movie lacks it is a descent and logical plot. Compared to the Harry Potter movies it is full of flat, meaningless and predictable characters and events. The magic duels never come close to the original movies. All the references to the original movies (*mentioning Dumbledore and Hogwarth once or twice) are meaningless and unnecessary and clearly only to make sure people do not forget it is a Harry Potter spin-offIt is not often I fall asleep during a movie...this time it happened...once...rewind...twice..rewind...and almost a third time but fortunately I was rescued by the end of the movie...well almost, I switched off the 'emotional' ending",3,5,7,3 August 2017
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," rates going down each day I think about it
","Now this is funny, when I watched the movie I enjoyed it a lot (maybe I drank a bit too much wine). Really I did. But then came the days afterward and the movie lost it. For some reason it kept buzzing in my mind and more and more I got annoyed by the little things in the movie, the silly twists, the flat characters, the unrealistic and not funny occurrences.. Ben Stiller is simply not convincing, I never liked him anyway, the storyline to unbelievable. Overall the acting is flat and uninspired.I expected the most of the movie to be part of his daydreams, simply because it was so unbelievable. Now that would have been OK if they were funny, but they are not.",6,1,1,21 June 2015
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," ah well
","The last Jedi is, like the previous movie was a copy of star wars 1, in many aspects a copy of the empire strikes back movie, there are so many similar elements. Sometimes they have a little twist, but is all there, a fleet on the run, a battle between twe two forces in front of the emperor (in a ridiculous setting), a pupil to be trained to Jedi (and a confrontation with self), very big battle ships that are unable to handle small ships, etc.
There are the usual ridiculous things we already know from Star Wars, like storm troopers that can't hit anything, a tracking device that can't be tracked by the empire, a deserted base which is fully operational in minutes with people dressed up for the battle, the people of 6-7 remaining carrierships all fit in the millenium Falcon...ok ok.
als this is put in a blender and made a slightly amusing movie: mix some left-overs into something new. Put your mind at 0, like with all star wars movies, sit back and let it come over you and it is pleasant enough.",6,0,0,1 January 2018
Avatar," Hyped, amazing graphics
","The movie of the year 2009...so I thought this must be good. But when the movie started I already had a bad feeling. Flat and stereotype characters. The damaged hero who can do what nobody else could do, not even the natives, the stupid military man, the commercial leader of the outpost, the reasonable scientist who knows better but is not believed, the 'good' natives with their holy secrets. Come on people, we are in the 21th century, movie making is over 100 year's old and we can not come up with anything better than that for a great movie? OK I admit the graphics blew me away, they are beautiful. For that reason alone this movie earns some points. But a movie is not just about nice pictures. It is also about story. Without a decend story a movie becomes nothing, a facade. It is a such a waste of the beautiful effects. And so the time watching this is also wasted",4,3,6,18 January 2013
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Disappointing
","What a absolute disappointed was this movie to the point of total annoyance. When it started it was absolutely stunning, the styling, the sensuality, the effects (for 1992), great imagery. And then suddenly it seems like the budget was gone, they cut vital parts from the movie (ok Prince Vlad is Dracula but we never see the transformation) and they finished it quickly. From the moment Jonathan and von Helsing burn the earth the movies turns fully the other way from high quality to 1930's board-carton special studio effect. The storyline is brought quickly to an end, the chase and fight that should be the climax is just a joke so cheap it was made. Even in 1992 this was probably laughable, maybe good for the 1930's. And there are many more, Dracula should rest in his own ground, but why then is he hanging like a bat on the ceiling at night (why is it still in boxes), when he is supposed to be most active? What is this guy in the jail having to do with everything? With the corruption of the original story this movie never should have been released and anyone that admires great classic literature should have risen against it.Absolutely annoying after such a great start of the movie. And it kept me annoyed several days afterwards",3,4,6,4 August 2014
Moonrise Kingdom," you need an odd sense of humor
","This brilliant movie about a pre-teen boy and girl that fall in love and run away, leaving the people of the bourgeois island in hysteric panic (after they noticed the kids were gone and started to care), requires an odd sense of humor. If you do not have that, if you're as bourgeois as the islanders, it will be wasted on you. Otherwise you will be in for an amazing treat, full of absurd situations, relations, households, events and dialogues. And with people desperately trying to cope with their lives,in contrast with the young love of two outcasts.The whole movie from begin to end gets you of your feet, it is all close to normal, but just not that. The tree-house on the top of a thin stripped tree (commented as: 'isn't that dangerous?') represents the whole atmosphere of the movie.Highly recommended",9,1,1,9 November 2017
The Matrix," outdated
","When this movie came out about 20y ago it was ofcourse a benchmark for all new action movies. The 3D rotation shots and wire-stunt were groundbreaking, as were several other special effects. And it had a deeper layer: the question what is realityLooking at it today I noticed that it had aged quickly. The styling looks ridiculous, it is mostly shooting and running, the characters pretty flat, dialogues basic. The storyline has some suprise jumps where you question how they knew that. It is like Avatar, the visuals blew you away, but the content is so-so.",5,0,0,26 March 2020
Cloud Atlas," love it or hate it
","A movie's greatness,or better uniqueness, is often shown in the reviews, it will be either hate <3 or love >8. Cloud Atle\as is in this unique category with movies like mulholland drive. Now it can not match with MD, therefor there are too many little things in this movie. E.g. I never liked the pompous acting of Tom Hanks, Halle Berry is a very overrated actress and the special effect are somewhat overdone sometimes. Also the storyline, though very great, isn't that amazingly great. Too much love involved in an attempt to please to normal public. But it is a movie that needs to be watched several times in order to get all the little links, references, tricks etc that connect the six story lines (cloud atlas is written for a sextet) that are in this movie.So I love it",9,2,4,12 November 2013
Mad Max: Fury Road," The downfall
","what is wrong when pulp movies like this can get a high scores by audiences...Does that mean these are faked? Does that mean people are very happy when they see a exceptionally standard full-movie chase without any depth, plot or content what-so-ever...just a lot of explosions, some shooting, some weirdo's going 'whaaaaa' most of the time, a few side-hero's get it for the sad emotions, the real hero's get away with everything and can fight along even with arrows through their bodies... Is that all it takes nowadays? Does this say something about the current society where content is replaced by fake news and cheap amusement...thinking is not allowed? We need cheap amusement in order to distract us from the fact many need two jobs to make ends meet, if they have jobs at all, while the rich finance movies like this to keep us distracted?The fact that movies like this can get high scores and even win Oscars says something about society I fear.",2,5,9,9 August 2017
The Martian," Duct tape commercial
","Is this a bad movie? Not it is not, it is pretty entertaining if you put your mind to 0 an leave all the physical nonsense pass by. Small example, the Aries spacecraft is supplied with new food, but never with new fuel and in order to make the maneuvers they want to make, they will need a lot. And they seem to have never ending supply of duct-tape on board. The characters: yes, who are these people, our funny botanist and those who so joyfully take another 2 years in space and wow, in the end there is also a short love scene, although the helmet is in the way.But the visuals are damn good, I admit, it is a convincing mars they made in this movie.My biggest question is why this movie is rated 8.2 on IMDb. I sure wonder why so often the very mediocre, but high-budget, movies end up with such high ranking",6,1,4,8 February 2016
