The Rock," The Action Movie for Excellence... Pure Military Motivation
","When I first saw this movie I felt really touched... Specially when a patrol of Navy SEAL's are badly killed in the name of their country and the judgement they did to their flag... Really motivating, full of action and a great cast... Sean Connery is great, and I have not seen even one movie featuring Nicholas Cage that's been boring. If you have never seen this fantastic secuence of action, don't wait any longer... You won't regret it. I even got the Soundtrack, I listen to it everytime I need a bit of strength !!!",10,2,2,25 October 2001
