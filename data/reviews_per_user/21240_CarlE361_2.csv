Skyfall," Worth watching but don't expect anything amazing.
","Okay, so I just watched 'Skyfall'. I enjoyed the film and thought it was pretty decent. A lot of the cinematography and scenery was absolutely beautiful and gave Skyfall a really nice feel to it. Most of the action was fun to watch but in all honesty I was not very impressed, particularly with the start of the film. Some of the acting and dialogue was extremely cheesy but overall the acting was okay. Bardem did a great job at being the Bond villain 'Silva' and made the character likable. There were numerous plot holes that left me scratching my head like when 007 would allow innocent people to be killed and when he was attacked by a ghost train. All in all this movie was good but it's no way near exceptional or ground breaking.",6,0,3,26 February 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," The Hobbit has definitely exceeded my expectations
","Wow, all I can say is wow. An Unexpected Journey is a lovely start to what will most definitely be an amazing trilogy. It looked amazing and the 3D has been done very well making you feel as if you were there from time to time. The action scenes were great and the humour was hilarious making this a very enjoyable film. Of course the film is not exactly like the book but honestly so far it has followed the book more closely than The Lord Of The Rings did. There were a few small things that were changed but Jackson would have done this in order to get on with the 'bigger picture'. There was also one fairly significant part added (it was a action scene) that did not happen in the book but this actually helped progress the story further and more smoothly. Also the way Peter has included the appendices has been quite effective and has helped improve the story by giving it more depth. Although, one of these scenes did drag on a little but it's nothing to really worry about as it was still interesting. To those of you that are worried about this being a trilogy you honestly shouldn't as by the end of the film it wasn't even through half of the books material. I will definitely be seeing The Hobbit again sometime soon and I advise you all to go and see it!",10,4,16,25 December 2012
