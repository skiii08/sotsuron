Sucker Punch," Director's Cut 2nd Time Around
","Much better movie after a few beers (watched it sober the first time). And did some research before watching again. Finally realized how much effort the actors/actresses (sorry, old school) put into this movie. You go ladies - definitely not girls. Will be if not already a cult classic similar to Rocky Horror Picture Show. Misunderstood at first but finally embraced by many.",8,9,11,7 March 2020
