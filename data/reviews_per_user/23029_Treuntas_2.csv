Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This a movie for Star Wars fans.
","I've been watching the so-called reviews on TV and I have to say that the critics obviously know jack about Star Wars.To truly appreciate 'The Phantom Menace,' you have to be a big Star Wars fan. It answers so many questions that fans have wanted to know.If this movie was just another movie, granted it would be too flashy and lacking for people, but because this movie is for Star Wars fans it kicks so much ass.For me (a big Star Wars fan) it was worth watching at 4 o'clock in the morning on May 19th. It's interesting to watch Palpatine manipulate the Republic and the Trade Federation so he can satisfy his hunger for power.'The Phantom Menace' is not about the Naboo war, it is about the beginnings of Anakin, Obi-Wan and the Emperor (Darth Sidious). The Naboo war is only a useful tool to further Darth Sidious'/Palpatine's goals.",Null,0,0,21 May 1999
The Matrix," What is real and what is reality?
","The Matrix is one of those rare movies, that is very distinct and incredible. After seeing this movie a person's perspective of the world can be placed on a shakey foundation.The action is phenomonal. The fight scenes are fast, furious and amazing. The special effects are spectacular and actually seem like they belong in the movie.This movie is best described as a science fiction flick with some cool action scenes (especially the main gunfight!).You have to see this movie, that is all there is to it.",Null,0,0,12 April 1999
