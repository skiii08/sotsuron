The Avengers," Michael Bay, take some notes from the master. Joss Whedon.
","i just came back from seeing avengers and let me tell you, its mind blowing!!. This is how transformers saga should have been, all that beautiful CGI, eye candy pleaser, mixed with some genuine well written script, wonderful acting and a very well character development. Thou some characters shine a little more than others, everyone are given their share of screen time, it doesn't feel rushed, it doesn't feel forced, all scenes feel natural, and very well deserved to be in.You get to know the history about some characters like black widow, and hawkeye , and it remove all doubts about them being implemented in the team, everyone needs everybody in order to succeed. As i said before, avengers is transformers, without the sucky part, no one can say its another cgi fest, cause its an excellent movie.As to my favorite superheroe movie, i have to say dark knight still is, cause the story was a little better, but avengers is following closely as second spot surelly. Just have to wait and see how dark knight rises perform.",9,3,7,27 April 2012
