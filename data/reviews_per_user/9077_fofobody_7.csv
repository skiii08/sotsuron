Requiem for a Dream," Ellen Burstyn!!!!!!!
","Wonderful movie, I can't believe this movie is still on my mind after I saw it 3 days ago. If you haven't seen this movie, please do so.  I like Julia Roberts, and I did think she deserved her oscar this year, but after seeing Ellen Burstyn in this movie, I no longer think that way.  This perhaps is the greatest acting performance in any movie I have ever seen, and it's a shame that Ellen Burstyn did not get the credit she deserved.  Wonderful effects, and very neat editing and camera tricks were used in this film. This is a very depressing movie, but see it for Ellen Burstyn's acting, if for nothing else.",10,0,0,10 June 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Yoda saves the film
","Film had a lot of great moments, besides the cheap love dialog between Anakin and Amidala.  See it for Yoda and Mace Windu, plus a history of Boba Fett.  Oh yeah, and Jimmy Smits was the worst casted actor in the history of film for his part.",7,0,0,24 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A bit long, but extremely wonderful.
","I am hoping this was just the start of Lord of the Ring movies.  The movie was a tad long, but was well worth it.  This makes every special effects movie before it look like a 'B' movie. See This movie.",9,0,0,19 December 2001

Schindler's List," 10? how about a 20
","Not the best movie ever, but it has got to be the most accurate, and heart wrenching movies ever made.  If you don't cry, or feel horrible leaving this movie, then you are not human.  This movie is a masterpiece, and anyone who puts it down shouldn't be allowed to watch a movie ever again.  If you haven't seen this movie, please, go out and do so.",10,9,14,1 June 2001
The Shawshank Redemption," Pure Masterpiece

Please, if you are one of these people, email me so we can talk, and so i can ultimately rip your soul apart and see what it is like to be non-human.  As far as the movie goes, im sure not many people have seen it, if you havent, please do so, you wont be sorry.",10,0,0,1 June 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," An instant classic
","The most fun i have ever had at a movie.  Its about time i left a movie in a great mood.  Clooney, Turturro, Nelson are great.  They all deserved nominations.  Some say the movie was too long, but i think it was just right. See this movie, it is a masterpiece.",10,0,0,27 May 2001
