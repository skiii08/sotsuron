Casablanca," Casablanca - In my words (MANY SPOILERS!!!)
","The other day, I read a debate of sorts where some people were questioning the greatness of Casablanca.  They went so far as to call it 'overrated' and 'overacted'.  I had been meaning to watch it again, so I thought this time, I'd dig a little deeper to see if it perhaps is an overrated movie.  I first saw Casablanca was about 5 years ago, and I've have seen it about six or seven times now.  My first experience with Casablanca was very enjoyable. It was a pleasure to finally hear the lines and see the scenes that are so famous.  Plus, I thought the movie was very good, and that Ingrid Bergman was the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen.  Multiple viewings ensured the movie as one of my personal favorites, especially since the characters, scenes and acting seemed to get better every time.  It had been a while since I saw it before last night, and my goal was to try and figure out why I like it so much and whether or not it is 'overrated'.The verdict?  Casablanca, at it's core just an anti-war propaganda film, is still arguably the best film ever made.  It (as a film, not an idea) is flawless in every way and pure joy to watch for the first time or the eighth time.Surrounding Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca is the greatest collection of character actors ever put together in one movie.  Together, along with director Michael Curtiz, they craft a complex and layered plot against the backdrop of the greatest movie plot manufacturer, World War II.Basically, Casablanca asks you to believe that Rick, a man seems to have a great setup and who claims to stick out his neck for no one, is willing to give up EVERYTHING for the cause of the movement.  To make this truly believable, the movie HAS to be perfect.  We are to believe that Rick's love for Ilsa was so great that he would have risked capture in France to follow Ilsa if she had told him the truth at the train station.  We believe that Ilsa's love for Rick is so great, that she's willing to go through years of torment knowing what she's done to Rick, but that she did it for his own good.  Then, we find out that she actually did it because her love (was it love?) was so great for another man, she had to give up Rick for him.  When all three clash in Casablanca, Ilsa gives into Rick because her love for him is so great.  But ultimately, Rick's desire to stick his neck out for no one, which had been questioned throughout the film through other characters, is abandoned and he makes the ultimate sacrifice in giving up Ilsa, his livelihood, and maybe his freedom and life for 'the cause'.Do we believe all this?  Well, I do.  Primarily, it's the acting of Humprhey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid that does it for me.  The looks that Bogart and Bergman give each other are more than enough to convince.  Bogart gives us incredible insight to how painful his parting with Ilsa in Paris was, and the incredibly hateful way he treats her in Casablanca shows how much he was hurt by her actions.  Bergman, when looking at 'Rick', expresses all the desire and regret in the world with the far away look in her eyes. On the other hand, her eyes and actions express an incredible admiration, respect and plutonic love for 'Victor', but not a sensual love.  It's Bergman's emotion in her portrayal of Ilsa that convinces us of these feelings.  Words alone would not have sufficed.  When she makes the decisions she does, I buy them because she is so convincing. 
All that being said, the character/actor that really makes the whole thing work is Paul Henreid/'Victor'.  Henreid depicts a person that is so passionate about his calling (leader of the French resistance against Germany), but at the same time, loves Ilsa so much that he is and has been unwilling to leave her no matter what the cost.  He did not leave her side when she was sick for two weeks despite the danger it left him in, and he won't leave her in Casablanca.  And she won't leave him.  Henreid's Victor is a great leader, and unafraid of anything.  For such an important character, again, the words are not enough.  Action and emotion was essential to the believability of Victor's character, and thus, the whole story.  An example of this, and of what makes Casablanca so great, is the scene at Rick's when Victor leads the patrons in the French anthem La Marseillaise.  At the time, the members of the German Third Reich that are present at Rick's are singing a rousing Nazi song, The Watch on the Rhine. Victor goes to the band and instructs them to start La Marseillaise.  The band members look at Rick for his guidance, and he quietly nods his head in approval.  Remember, this is the guy who sticks his neck out for no one. Victor then sings unabashedly, and inspires the predominantly French and French sympathetic crowd to join him, and they drown the Nazi's out.  I am sixty years and an ocean removed from this time and place, but am still incredibly moved by this scene nonetheless.  We are convinced with an episode like this that Victor is indeed a great leader, and it is ESSENTIAL that he get out of the inevitable danger that lies in Casablanca.  We know this, and more importantly, Ilsa realizes this. She will do ANYTHING, as evidenced by her pulling the gun on Rick to try and force him to give up the letters of transit.  But EVEN MORE importantly, Rick realizes what a great leader and important man Victor is, and that Victor loves Ilsa.  Rick knows that Ilsa is essential to Victor, she's 'the thing that keeps him going'.  So he must help Victor, and to do so, he must give up Ilsa, who has previously given into him.  Remember Rick must 'do the thinking for all of us'.  And not only does Rick have to give up Ilsa to help Victor, he must sell his cafe, hold the prefect at gunpoint and eventually kill a Nazi to ensure Victor and Ilsa leave.  He risks the sacrifice of everything for Victor and his cause.Lost in all this, again, is the great array of characters in the movie.  Not the least of which is the Prefect of Police Renault, played by Claude Rains. He behaves much like Rick throughout the whole movie, looking out only for himself.  He, like Rick, isn't entirely on the up and up.  In the end, of course, he and Rick turn out to be not such bad guys, after all.  And Rick and Renault's mutual respect for each other leads, of course, to possibly the most famous line to ever end a movie.  Simply magical.  Great comic banter is provided by Sydney Greenstreet, who plays Ferrari, a competitor of Rick's, as well as S.Z. Skall, playing the Carl the head waiter. 
Great direction by Michael Curtiz, photography by Arthur Edeson (who also did The Maltese Falcon) and a score only add to the perfection of this movie.  The real magic is in what was created by Bogart, Bergman and Henreid.  Bergman, in particularly, is simply radiant and electric.  I can't think of a more beautiful woman that I've ever seen in a particular movie. I also find it simply amazing that the script for Casablanca was practically written as they went along.  The movie was shot in sequence with an unfinished script, and the actors and crew didn't know how the whole thing would end.  It's amazing because every thought and action exhibited by the principal players, even those early in the film, are consistent with the ultimate destinies of the characters.  HOW did they do that???  Casablanca is a flawless work of art and seems almost as if it was destined for greatness by how it all magically comes together.  Not only is it great, but it's flat out incredibly fun to watch.",Null,0,0,7 March 2001
Judgment at Nuremberg," Superb film
","This is a superb film that handles a sensitive subject extremely well.  Much like any courtroom film, we hear both sides of these atrocities committed in Nuremberg, and a verdict is handed down.  Not that the Nazis deserved to have their 'side' even heard, but we do live in a democracy.  The film is informative, educational, moving and thrilling.  Stanley Kramer makes the most filming 2 1/2 hours in a courtroom with interesting camera angles, zoom ins and zoom outs, and other camera tricks.But what really makes this film so great is the incredible acting. Maximillian Schell gives an astoundingly remarkable performance, one of the best performances I've ever seen, as the German defense counsel.  Spencer Tracy, while more or less an onlooker for most of the film, is superb in his closing address to the court.  Judy Garland and Montgomery Clift also have great memorable supporting roles.  The horridly important subject matter and Schell's incredible performance make this film a must see.  Easily one of America's 100 greatest films.",10,1,2,21 November 2001
Collateral," Disappointing
","Collateral, despite the praise lavished by many, is a well acted, but very mediocre thriller. Spoilers contained within.It opens up with an outstanding scene between Jamie Foxx and Jada Pinkett Smith that is well written, well thought out and takes it's time developing.Smith, in particular, pauses and chooses her words carefully as a woman would in a real situation like this. It's not the typical 'meet cute' where the conversation's outcome is never in doubt.Then, Cruise gets into Foxx's cab and pays him $600 for the night to drive him around to the five assassinations he has to complete. I really appreciate(d) the idea behind Collateral, the developing relationship between Max and Vincent. I thought Cruise was pretty good as Vincent throughout, and Foxx was really good as Max throughout. Mann's direction lends a lot to insight, with closeups and distorted and unusual viewpoints used throughout. Finally, I like the idea of a hit man having a cabbie drive him from hit to hit. So what's my problem with Collateral? Two things, both pretty big in my opinion, that I would probably dismiss in a lesser thriller, but that I won't forgive in one that's trying to rise above it's genre.First, and maybe Tarantino has molded or distorted my idea of what aprofessional killer should be, but Vincent is not much of a professional. Yeah, he's terrific with a gun and sure, he's obviously got some kind of specialized hand to hand combat training, but he just doesn't have it emotionally. Pretty much by definition, you can't be a 'professional' killer (who's obviously highly paid) and avoid being whacked yourself or captured by authorities without being careful to a fault and never becoming emotionally involved in any way. The problem with the script in Collateral is that it picks and chooses the moments where Vincent exhibits these characteristics and the moments when he doesn't. He never seems to care if anyone is watching his actions or has seen him commit murder. He wears no disguise and makes no attempt to conceal his actions. He's not really in a hurry to escape from crime scenes. He's not concerned with the potential complications involved with killing people on public streets. Sometimes he trusts Max to do what he tells him to do, and sometimes he doesn't. The sum parts of this character just don't fit the equation. And I'm not talking about the various psychological elements of Vincent that the film tries to explore, like his warped view of life or his childhood. I'm talking about the rigorous demands of being a professional killer. I just didn't buy it in the end.The second big problem I had was the subplot involving the various detectives trying to, and then piecing together the reason behind all the killing they're encountering this particular night. The following is not something you could say until you saw the film until the end, but this particular subplot affects the main plot in ABSOLUTELY NO WAY. While interesting to a degree and providing more interesting characters, the detectives (except for one brief moment) make no encounter with the two leads and don't affect their actions at all. This is something that bothered me more and more as I thought about it. They may as well have instead had a subplot involving the man who hired Vincent to do the killings, or a subplot involving the jazz club owner. It wouldn't have made a difference. While interesting, the subplot in this case adds nothing to the big picture except making the film's main story go from credible to implausible. I'm referring, of course, to the shootout at the nightclub involving the fourth hit. Both Vincent and the police know who the target is before Vincent gets to the club. One of the detectives even orders 'get him out of there'. But for some inexplicable reason, not only is he still sitting at his table when Vincent arrives, no attempt has been made or is being made to 'get him out of there'. Didn't understand that, nor did I understand how a small army of trained capable detectives and LAPD are unable to capture, take down, slow down or even tap Vincent on the shoulder as he executes a dozen people, including the witness. It's like they weren't even there, but they were. What were they doing? How did Vincent possibly get out of that? And they didn't leave the cab sitting in the middle of the street when they went in, so how the hell was it sitting there waiting for them to escape in? And while I'm at it, don't the bars and clubs in LA close at 2AM? It had to be well after 3AM by the time all this went down. Again, these are all things that I wouldn't sweat in a typical silly action movie. I'd just watch it, give it a C- or worse, and move on. But this film aspires to be much more, and it really isn't. The ending is, of course, predictable, with the final target being Smith, Max's earlier fare. Though there wasn't much to write home about in this resolution, it wasn't bad and I don't think it made the movie any better or worse. Foxx saves the day by himself, in what is at least a 20-30 minute (real time) sequence AFTER the cops have been called to the scene where you'd have to assume that a huge area manhunt would be underway for both Max and Vincent. Not a single cop ever comes near the vicinity, however.Collateral has a lot going for it, but unfortunately more taking away from it. C.",Null,0,0,10 September 2004
Pearl Harbor," Not even an 'A' for effort
","Really, to be totally fair, I should see this movie again, taking a notepad with me so I can note all that's wrong with it.  But as it stands, maybe I'll be able to stay under the 1,000 word limit.I suppose if you had no idea what Pearl Harbor and World War II were all about and weren't aware of the mediocre at best talent of Michael Bay,, and you like silly love stories, you might think this movie is pretty good.  I guess I don't inherently have a problem with setting a silly love story against the backdrop of such a serious topic.  Even after seeing the movie, I still don't really have a big problem with it.  Even some 'classic' Pearl Harbor films include silly love stories (From Here to Eternity, In Harms Way).  The problem with this one is that it's so BADLY written.  Randall Wallace and Bay should be ashamed of themselves.  The kind of simple, silly and chemistry-free dialogue written between Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsdale is the kind you'll find in classic films of the 40's.  It was effective then, but it doesn't work today, not even in a period piece. The dialogue written for the love story in Titanic ain't Shakespeare, but for the most part, you're not sitting there groaning every time one of the characters opens their mouth like you are in this film. 
I'm no expert on World War II and Pearl Harbor, far from it.  However, I have seen many classic and current films on the subject, and have a friend who IS an expert, so I think I know my fair share.  Of course Bay is going to take liberties in making his film, every filmmaker does.  Apparently, the Japanese fighter planes were not the same color in the movie as they were in real life.  Things like that aren't going to bother me so much, but when only two planes were able to get off the ground during the actual assault, and those two planes are piloted by our Heroes in Pearl Harbor, that bothers me.  It bothers me that Bay has his Japanese fighter planes flying over a baseball game that's going on at 8 in the morning because he thinks it's a good looking shot.  I'm sure there are plenty of other glaring liberties taken by Bay in this film, but I'll leave them to the experts to point out.However, I do have one more fact related complaint about the film, that being Cuba Gooding Jr.'s character.  Here we have, without a doubt, one of the most worthless characters in film history.  Before I saw the movie, I thought that the character was just going to be a token black character added to make the film appeal to a broader demographic.  I figured, since black men were pretty much limited to the kitchen on Naval ships in those days, that the character we see on the machine gun torrents in the trailers is fictional.  Well, here's a news flash, he was a REAL person, we find out at the end, who received an award for his 'brave' service!  I certainly hope that Cuba had more scenes that were left on the cutting room floor for some reason, because if he agreed to do this silly, insignificant part in the film based on what I saw of him, I'm really disappointed.  What an embarrassment to Gooding and his entire race.  Bay should be ashamed for the way this REAL character is handled in the film (all three minutes of his screen time).Everyone likes to get emotionally involved in a film, and I'm no different. I'll admit, I found the trailer moving.  I thought for sure I'd at least get a little weepy-eyed at some point of Pearl Harbor.  As it turns out, Bay fails again.  This film has instantly made my 'Top Five Most Manipulative Films' list.  It's embarrassing the length that Bay goes to, especially at the end, to try to get you to cry.  A film like Saving Private Ryan can move you just by it's sheer horror and the nonverbal acting of it's characters. Wallace and Bay just POUR it on, though, in this film to the point where you're drowning.  SPOILER AHEAD SPOILER AHEADThe manner in which Josh Hartnett's character dies is really badly written. It almost seems like they thought that Hartnett's plane going down wasn't heroic enough.  He had to save his best buddy one more time after a VERY awkward confrontation with a Japanese patrol on the China coast in order to cement his status as a hero.  Again, this is just bay trying to POUR on the sentimentality.  Someone should have told him that the EVENTS THAT ACTUALLY TRANSPIRED between 12/41 and 4/42 provide more than enough sentiment by themselves.  END SPOILERI didn't hate this movie.  At the very least, my interest in the subject is higher than it's ever been, and I'm sure that the film will inspire a wave of new found interest in the subject by a new generation.  So Bay does deserve some credit for that, but not too much.  A better film about Pearl Harbor would have raised awareness, too.  I'm just really disappointed that they took such a great and important subject and turned up with these results.  I thought the actors, for the most part, did the best they could with the script.  Alec Baldwin, in particular, was quite good as Dolittle. Some of his really silly lines will ultimately be memorable because he did such a good job of delivering them.  The bombing of Pearl Harbor was, of course, the best part of the film, though it went on too long.  Someone needed to tell Bay that just because the sinking of the Titanic lasted 45 minutes (screen time) doesn't mean that the bombing of Pearl Harbor had to last that long.Bay's biggest problem is that he's just no good at telling stories. Everytime I thought I was going to be moved, he cut.  Every time he had a good idea or scene or camera angle going, he cut.  Then, he sticks with scenes and ideas that go nowhere (like the train scene near the beginning). Who cares?A lot of the problems I have with a film can be overlooked if it's a silly, fun film like The Mummy Returns.  That crew is allowed to defy the laws of physics and reality in general, because it's a fantasy film.  I grant the makers of Pearl Harbor no such leeway.  No matter how entertaining some parts of it may have been, I can't overlook the glaring problems that a film about such a serious topic is so bogged with.Grade:  C-",6,0,0,26 May 2001
Meet Joe Black," Love it or hate it
","I think this film is magnificent and very unfairly criticized.  It is fantasy at its best, is beautifully filmed, well written and well acted. Anthony Hopkins, in particular, is fantastic.  And above all, when it comes to love, 'lightning should strike' and we shouldn't settle. 
Some people (OK, most people) say this film is too long, and that is their biggest problem with it.  I think that's one of the films more prevalent attributes, so that's where I'll start.  Either you're into a film or you're not.  If you're not into it, even a 90 minute film can seem like an eternity if there's no 'action'.  Camille, A.I., Me Myself and Irene and any James Bond movie fit that bill for me.  Therefore, this is one of those films where I won't argue with someone who doesn't like it.  It's impossible to like a film that can't sustain your interest.  Usually, unless it's just an obviously bad movie, the blame for this lies with the viewer.  However, I can concede that this film is not for all tastes and let the naysayers off the hook.I don't think the film is slow at all, I just think that Martin Brest took his time in allowing the story to unfold and the characters to develop.  Joe Black is very much a character study.  Most character studies only involve one person.  This one has two main characters and three or four more lesser characters who are all studied to one degree or another.  Cutting this film down to two hours would mean losing a lot of the insight we get into these characters.  No scene is rushed in this film.  All are allowed to develop at their own pace and continue on until they've said what they have to say. It's a marvel, and an tribute to the film that the studio allowed it to be released at this length.  The decision makers must have had similar thoughts, or they would have chopped an hour off it.  After all, the far inferior original, Death Takes A Holiday, was less than 90 minutes, I believe.The cinematography for this film is absolutely beautiful.  It's not real hard to believe that the movie had such a large budget when you stop to notice how magnificent the settings are.Thoughts on the cast...Anthony Hopkins lends dignity and credibility to every film he's in.  His character represents another moral of this film, I think, that we should do as much in this life as possible before it's gone. He, particularly, is the master of 'keep filming until I'm done talking' in this film.  He's a careful man, and he chooses his words carefully.  He is not one to be rushed.  Neither is Death.  Brad Pitt certainly isn't the best thing about this film, but he doesn't hurt it any.  His take on the character is at least a fresh and interesting one.  And often funny.  Marcia Gay Harden is effective as the lesser loved daughter.  The first time I saw this film, I thought for sure Jeffrey Tambor would be a villain, as he always seems to be.  I was pleased to see him in a role as a weak, but essentially good man.  Claire Forlani is really what makes the wheels of this film turn, though.  After all, what is the premise of this film?  Death falls in love with a mortal woman.  How long has this guy been around?  How many women has he come across?  In other words, the girl better be pretty great.  One of the many weaknesses of Death Takes A Holiday is the girl that Death falls for, Evelyn Venable, is pretty weak.  I won't pretend Forlani is a modern day Katherine Hepburn, but she is incredibly beautiful and, in addition to portraying her character well, has a presence about her that Venable lacked.  She's believable as someone Death would fall for.  I guess. How the hell do I know?  This film is a big throwback to the classic era.  I won't say it's Capraesque, since it digs a lot deeper into the characters than any of Frank's films, but the idealistic hero in an unrealistic situation is very reminiscent of Capra's films.Here's a thought that I can't really fit into any other paragraph, so I'll give it it's own.  Although the propensity of films to include an obligatory sex scene seems to have dwindled off in the last decade from it's ridiculous plateau in the 70's, I still tend to get annoyed by them in today's films. Come on, it's the 21st century.  We know they're having sex, we don't need to see it for five minutes.  Every director seems to think he'll be the one to make his sex scene better than the others, or show us something we haven't seen hundreds of times already.  Almost always, they are wrong and the sex scene is tedious.  This film's scene is an exception.  First, it is different because we're talking about Death here.  But besides that, Brest films the scene just like he films the rest of the film.  Beautifully and slowly.  Most importantly, he concentrates the camera on facial expression, not naked bodies.  The ending is sappy and pours it on.  But I love it.  Go ahead and call me soft.  I love the fireworks.  I love the endless rendition of 'What a Wonderful World'.  And I love the happy ending.Typically, I think remakes and new takes of/on old films are inferior to the originals.  But this is the exception.  Meet Joe Black takes the far inferior Death Takes A Holiday much deeper.  Death Takes A Holiday portrays Death falling in love at first sight, and the whole film only lasts one night.  Fredric March is a great actor, but was extremely robotic in that role.  To do a story like this, the Death character needs to have a personality.  One of the many reasons this version is superior.",9,2,3,7 April 2002
Mulholland Drive," WAY out there
","Roger Ebert wrote the following sentence, which I think nails my thoughts right on the head:  I suspect the best way to appreciate 'Mulholland Drive' is simply to experience it as a series of scenes, each one with a power and consistency of its own, that do not 'add up' to a logical plot summary, or cannot be reduced to an explanation--although various patterns and narratives form out of the mist and then evaporate.I was with the film for the first hour and fifty five minutes, then it dove off the proverbial cliff.  I continued to try and make sense of what was happening over the last half hour, but realized pretty quickly that it wasn't going to make sense.I don't think I'd have a problem with someone blasting this film for being outrageously self indulgent and for not making a shred of sense in the end. Lynch certainly walks the line, and one could argue he crosses it way too many times.  As for me, I'll take the high road.  It almost seems to me like Lynch made this 2 1/2 hour film from a four hour script.  The imaginary four hour script probably would make sense.  Then, he cut two hours out of the script and scattered a half and hours worth of dreamlike sequenses throughout that bear some resemblance to the original story, but not much. The result is...well, I'm not sure.  But it was a great experiment, I thought.  Hard to give it a grade.  It's as close to a pass/fail film as has ever been made.  If you wanted to see other films like this, check out The Day of The Locust and Don't Look Now, both made in the seventies.  I hated both of them, and gave them 'failing' grades.  I enjoyed Mulholland Drive, even though it didn't make any more sense than either of those films.  I'll give it an 'A-' because that accurately describes my level of enjoyment.Probably the most fascinating thing about this film is all the plotlines that were underdeveloped or dropped altogether.  How about the cops investigating the accident?  Or the director and the guys forcing their casting choice on him?  Or the director's wife?  What was the deal with that?  It was incredibly audacious of Lynch to throw these things out there, but somehow it fits right in with the rest of the film.  Certainly a memorable film experience.",Null,0,0,21 April 2002
The Piano," In a word: Stupid
","Yes, stupid.  I can't find a single word that more accurately describes this movie.  I was looking forward to seeing it and expected to see a good movie. I do have some spoilers later, so be warned.There's a woman who refuses to speak, for seemingly no reason at all.  I guess so that a movie can be made about it.  Stupid.  She's forced to leave whatever land she's from because her father has forced her to marry a man who lives in the New Zealand outback, one who she has never met or seen. Stupid.I guess the biggest problem I had with this movie was that Holly Hunter's character, the heroine, is NOT LIKEABLE!  She is cold and unfeeling, and lacks any personality except when she 'pours her heart' into her piano. Like that's supposed to be enough to show us any real depth to her personality.  But I went with it.I actually liked Harvey Keitel's character, but I didn't buy his actions. He becomes enamored with the piano and with Hunter's character, again for seemingly no reason.  Again, probably so they could make a movie about it. She's cold and unfeeling.  She plays a few bars of something or other, and all of the sudden, he's infatuated with her.  Then, in an effort to impress and sweep his new bride off her feet, Sam Neill's character decides to trade Holly's piano to Keitel for some land. Uh, yeah.  OK.  Like he'd really do that.  Like she says in the movie, IT'S HER PIANO!  HERS!!!  But again, they wouldn't have had a movie unless he did it, so it's OK.  So, to get her piano back, Keitel, who uses the piano as an aphrodisiac for some reason, agrees to trade her keys for 'favors', which are initially just weird, then turn sexual in nature.  Again, it doesn't make much sense, but I went with it.Then, Neil's character finds out and gets insanely jealous and angry.  Why? Holly had given him NOTHING.  She has NO PERSONALITY.  What is there to be jealous of?  Throw her out and forget it.  Why does he even care?  I can't believe that he loves her, or even LIKES her.  Stupid.  Then, when she tries to contact Keitel again and Neil finds out, what does he do?  He CUTS HER FINGER OFF.  Actually, he CHOPS IT OFF WITH AN AXE.  This is where the movie reached a new plateau of stupid and ridiculous.  So much so, that I laughed out loud when he chopped off her digit.Neil then has a remarkable change of heart about the whole thing, again for seemingly no reason, and allows Holly to leave with Keitel.  On the boat ride out, Holly decides she doesn't want the Piano anymore and orders it thrown into the sea.  Now, I understand what's happening here.  She's found love and doesn't feel she needs the piano to express herself anymore. That's fine, but she still loves the piano.  She loves to play it, and she loves that one in particular.  So she just wants to throw it overboard? Again, it's utterly stupid, but I guess they couldn't express the metaphor any other way.  However, the stupidity of throwing the piano overboard just to express that metaphor pales in comparison to the stupidity of what happens as the piano goes over.Holly's foot gets caught in the rope tying that's tied to the piano, and she gets dragged down towards the sea floor along with the piano.  Wow, what are the odds.  And I knew it was going to happen before they even shoved the piano over.  Again, it was done only because they needed to have a metaphor of Holly truly 'escaping' the piano, which is what she miraculously does underwater.Finally, the movie comes to a merciful end with a COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY 'they lived happily ever after' scene.  This scene is unnecessary whether you liked the movie and bought what it was selling or not.It's really disappointing to me that this type of high class drivel is made. It's even more disappointing that this drivel is so highly praised.  The only thing redeeming about this movie is the performance of Anna Paquin, who is adorable as Holly's daughter.  Unfortunately, her performance is tainted because her only real purpose in the movie is to serve as a translator when writing and sign language might slow a scene down too much.  I also expected a great score, but thought it was extremely mediocre.  Any actor could have learned to play what was in the movie in a matter of weeks.STUPID.  Grade:  D-",1,76,152,12 December 2000
Vanilla Sky," More good than bad
","What a mess.  Most of the 'messy' films you'll see are messy because of editing.  This one is messy because the plot is too thick.  There are arguably four or five plot points in this film.  However, as ugly as it gets sometimes, Vanilla Sky is interesting and somewhat perplexing (in a good way) and I generally liked it for the most part.Yes, Cameron Crowe is out of his element here.  Just like the Coen brothers have no business doing a romantic comedy, Crowe doesn't need to be sticking his head in stories like this.  Mainly because his style brings nothing to the table in this kind of film.  His trademark character monologues and epiphanies simply convolute the film more than it already is and the 'dancing' he does around the central part of the story is alright in simple minded films like Singles and Almost Famous, but we don't need that here.I think you'd really have to go out of your way to spoil this film, but I'll just stick to the basics anyway.  The first half hour or so of the film is bad.  The Tom Cruise character is an arrogant prick, as he is in every other one of his films, but he's an unlikeable arrogant prick in this one.  And the Cameron Diaz character is equally unlikeable.  Someone must have told Penelope Cruz that if she spoke English but didn't lose any of her Spanish accent, she'd sound cute and adorable and everyone would love her.  Doesn't work on me.  She's just as annoying as Cruise and Diaz. 
So what did I like about this film you ask?  Basically, when the plot starts to jump around, the film gets interesting.  I didn't like all of the plot turns and a couple of them don't make any sense, even after finishing the film, but the premise is fascinating once it gets going.  And I did like the way in which the story was presented, in the meeting between Cruise and Kurt Russell.  Moderate spoiler ahead...Some people might not like to constantly be second guessing what they're seeing onscreen, but I generally do.  Watching this film, you never know if you're seeing the past, present or future, or if what you're seeing is real or a dream.  Or a hallucination.  There's plenty to criticize and plenty to be annoyed with in Vanilla Sky. But the flip side is a little more plentiful, in my opinion. 'B-'",Null,0,0,5 July 2002
Signs," Lame
","M. Night Shyamalan has often been compared to a young Steven Spielberg.  He has the same ability to craft and build up a story that Spielberg has always had.  Where the comparison ends is that Shyamalan has not proven that he can finish the job.  All three of his films, this one, The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, are superbly crafted.  He's good at writing suspense, buildup, and quiet horror. Not many can argue that the payoff of the Sixth Sense was about as good as it gets.   Unbreakable played along the same lines, but the payoff, while ingenious, practically ruined the film, in my opinion.  The payoff in Signs also ruins the film, and even lacks the ingenuity of Unbreakable.  It is dull, unimaginative and disappointing.  Shyamalan's angle in Signs is not to show the invasion of the aliens (Independence Day), but to show one family's reaction to that invasion,  Kind of like Night of the Living Dead.  The difference is, the people in NOTLD are acting and reacting to what's happening around them.  In Signs, the focus is more on a dead wife/mother, faith, and the eccentric behavior of two children.  And it's not very interesting and makes for a lousy payoff.   So where did Signs go wrong?  I don't know, or I'd be getting paid 12 million per movie like Shyamalan did for this.  I don't have the imagination to devise a film/script like this, and Shyamalan doesn't either.  This film didn't make me think.  It didn't scare me.  It wasn't profound in any way. And I think it was trying to be/do all those things.  I can't say how this film should have ended.  But the way it did end was the wrong way.  After an enormous success right out of the gate, Shyamalan has failed twice in a row. And all of his films have been 'pass or fail', in my opinion.  Films that build up this much throughout have to deliver a knockout punch.On the plus side, Signs was very well acted.  Mel Gibson was solid, albeit unbelievable as a farming reverend.  Joaquin Phoenix, normally an enormous ham, gave a solid and quiet performance as Gibson's younger brother. However, the real acting chops in this film go to the two kids.  Rory Culkin, in my opinion, has confirmed himself as the best child actor currently working in Hollywood.  I thought he was outstanding in You Can Count On Me, and his mature performance here shows that wasn't a fluke. Abigail Breslin plays Bess, the young daughter.  Despite the fact that Shyamalan was trying to do something spooky with her character and failed, she still gives an outstanding mature performace.  It's a shame she couldn't have done more.  The nice eye that Shyamalan has demonstrated in his previous films is not lost here, either.  His Hitchcockian knack of filming creatively and not relying on static shots and angles plays well here as it did in Sense and Unbreakable.  But Shyamalan needs to spend as much time, if not more, concocting dazzling endings to these films as he does building them up. Again, while I didn't care for the ending of Unbreakable, I at least give him credit for creativity.  The ending of Signs is lame and unimaginative. Spielberg would have blown us away.",Null,1,1,20 August 2002
Hustle & Flow," Possibly the best film of the year
","About 30 minutes into Hustle and Flow, not only did I think Terrence Howard had already earned his Oscar nomination, but had already won it. In DJay, he creates a very deep and layered character capable of brutal violence and unexpected moments of compassion at times. But mostly, he's just a real guy caught up in unreal businesses pursuing a dream.While Howard absolutely owns this film, the film is made great by the supporting cast that surrounds DJay, especially the women. In what is a very weak field of Supporting Actresses, both Taryn Manning (Nola) and Taraji Henson (Shug) would have been very worthy nominees this year. It is through these women (and the performances of the actresses) that we are able to see the gentler side of DJay. The moment where Shug tells DJay how much singing on the demo tape meant to her was one of the films best moments. As was the exchange between DJay and Nola as he's being arrested. Another great sequence happens when Key's wife Yevette (Elise Neal) gives up trying to fight her husbands dream and instead brings over the sandwiches. Every character in this film is deep and makes you care about them.I thought that, towards the end of the third act, when things take a turn for the worse between DJay and Skinny Black, that the film briefly spiraled out of control and got a little away from itself. Thankfully, it reeled itself back in pretty quickly once DJay was in prison. Maybe the three minutes or so of brutal violence and gunshots could have been replaced with a different way of DJay being incarcerated.Terrence Howard hooked me from the beginning and his performance didn't let me go until it was over. I was very much on the edge of my seat the whole time in a film that doesn't have much edge of your seat action. Hustle and Flow is frequently funny, dramatic, moving, shocking and sometimes all of them. And it's moral is that it's OK to have a dream and pursue it. And it doesn't do it in a hokey way. Unforgettable and possibly the best film of 2005.",9,1,2,28 February 2006
High Fidelity," Top Five reasons I love this movie
","High Fidelity has become one of my favorite films.  It has, in fact, snuck into the top 10.  Unfortunately, there's just no room for it in the top 5...Anyway, the top 5 is as follows:1. I relate to this film more than any film I've ever seen, as do many guys in their mid 20's, I'm sure.  Of course, I haven't personally been through everything Rob has, but I've been through a lot and I've seen others go through a lot.  On another level, I relate to the snobbery expressed by Rob, Dick and Barry as they look down on those who know less than them.  Not for music, but for film.  And I think anyone who has a knowledge of anything that is far superior to that of the common man can relate to these guys, whether it be music, film, books, cooking, politics, whatever.2. There are a number of great truths in this film.  It is quite possibly the greatest film ever made about the relationships between males and females, at least for our generation.  Rob's wandering and his eventual epiphinies are presented so well, it knocks you over.3. It has great characters.  Rob is an imperfect hero, but it's hard not to love him, nonetheless.  Laura is, on the surface, presented as NOT the ideal for Rob.  But she is great, and boy, he really does love her.  And I think I love her too!  Suffice to say, Jack Black's Barry is a riot and Dick is incredibly painful to watch (in a good way).  I think we've all known guys like this in our lives.  Joan Cusack has only a few short scenes, but she is spectacular, too, and nails her character.  The characters are unforgettable and so is their dialogue.  Don't even get me started on Tim Robbins!4. What a great soundtrack.  I have the CD, and whenever I listen to it (or hear a song from it), which is often, I want to watch the movie.  That's how you know a film has a great soundtrack.  Like Pulp Fiction in that respect, and in the respect that one of the reasons I look forward to watching the movie again and again is because of the music.5. It has a perfect ending.  (SPOILER) Rob proposes to Laura, and she doesn't say yes, she thanks him for asking.  Not your garden variety happy ending, but you're happy anyway because you know things are probably going to turn out alright.  Same for Rob's career as a producer.  He's not exactly setting the world on fire by putting out the record of a couple of skate ****'s, but it's a start.I love this movie, and it's one of my favorites.  I like it more every time I see it, and it gets better every time I see it.  However, I couldn't give it an 'A' when I first saw it, and I can't give it an 'A' now.  I give it an 'A-' for two reasons, things I can't get past.  One, the unforgivable use of rain to heighten the drama.  Not once, but about six times.  Second, what happens in Laura's car after her father's wake.  I just don't buy a girl wanting to do that in that particular situation, time and place. Ever.A great movie, an instant classic, and a tour de force for John Cusack.",9,0,1,23 January 2002
