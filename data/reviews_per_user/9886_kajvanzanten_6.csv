It," No Horror
","Nothing natural and nothing like real horror. It's so extremely predictable and put together real bad. The Conjuring, The Posession or The Boy, are really scary and real horror movies to me, this one does not even come close. Don't get me wrong, the idea of the whole movie is great but it was far from what i expected it to be.",5,1,3,3 May 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Just Spider-man
","I gave it a 7 because its Spider-man and the movies is put together real good, but that's it.... This movie did not give me the feeling i had with the previous Spider-Man movies. This movie is more about introducing Spider-Man to the Avengers then making him look like the crime fighter. It felt more like just a story of something that happened in the life of Spider-Man.",7,1,4,22 October 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Pirates fan
","Huge Pirates of the Caribbean fan here. Where i thought Pirates 4 'On Stranger Tides' missed its course, this movie made up for everything. Great to see how the stories of all pirates come together in the end. Specially the great love story between Elizabeth Swan and Will Turner. Captain Jack Sparrow is as funny as he always was and of course stays the greatest pirate of them all.",9,0,1,18 October 2017
Coco," Great movie
","Disney Pixar. I must say its one of there best movies i've seen in the past few years. Great story, at first i was a bit worried about how the skulls and skeletons would look in such a movie. I must say, they did great and i immediately fell in love with the characters. The movie makes you feel you are really in it and ofcourse the end is always a happy end.",9,1,1,3 May 2018
Sausage Party," Funny but speechless
","At first i didn't know what i had to think about this movie..... I gave it a 7 because its very funny (if its your type of humor). To me there is not much of a story in it, and i don't understand why you put this type of humor in an animated movie? Its very sexist and if i would be a father i will not show it to my children until there are 12+ or maybe even 16+. Its a fun movie with real vulgar humor. It left me a bit speechless at the end.",7,2,3,17 October 2017
12 Strong," Real action
","It's an action movie like American Sniper, Lone Survivor, Act of Valor or The Raid on Osama Bin Laden for example. I like those kinda action movies. It's based on something true with a real story in it. Not like those everyday action movies with jumping off buildings and over cars and where everyone can fight like Jackie Chan. The movie is put together real good and funny in some way.",7,4,8,3 May 2018
