The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Great for Twilight Lovers, Haters Beware
","I believe a lot of the people that are complaining, either never read the book (and liked it), or they're just haters. I personally liked it more than I did the first half of the book, but it stayed true to the book, and it was pretty enjoyable. The audience at Twilight movies almost always are terrible, but other than that, I loved this movie. The acting was incredible, and while I did get bored at a few parts, overall, the movie was absolutely wonderful.If you went into the theater, thinking it was going to be terrible, it would be terrible. Not gonna lie. Go in with an optimistic attitude, and you will leave with such. Hopefully the last will be more action packed.",9,0,5,12 August 2012
