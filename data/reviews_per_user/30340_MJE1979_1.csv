Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Boring Movie - Spoilers
","I saw Kill Bill Vol. 2 last night and I found the movie to be very boring with not as much as action as the first. I waited months and months to see this movie and even hyped it up with other people who saw the first one. And what did I get? A movie filled with dialogue. There was hardly any action at all compared to the last one. I was expecting more killing and less talking. You could take a date to this movie. Another thing that I thought was dumb was they had Vivica Fox and Lucy Lui in the credits and you could only see the back of their heads in this one. In one set of previews I saw, I know I saw Michael Jai White (Spawn, Mike Tyson), but he isn't in the movie. Last comment, the way she killed Bill could have had more of an action sequence. 2 hours of talk, talk, talk. I recommend Vol.1 over Vol.2, simply because of more action and less comedy.",Null,0,1,17 April 2004
