Scarface," Scarface is my absolute FAVORITE movie EVER!!
","Scarface is the best movie in the world. It is my absolute FAVORITE movie EVER!! It may be violent and have absolutely terrible language, but face it, it's wonderful! Al Pacino is great as Tony Montana, of course, because he is great at everything he does! If you haven't seen Scarface, go rent it now and watch it because you won't regret it!!!!!!",10,0,1,14 January 2004
The Godfather," The movie that made me love Al Pacino
","The Godfather was the first movie I ever saw that Al Pacino was in. I was glued to the TV the first time I saw it (of course I was, who wouldn't be?). Now Al Pacino is my favorite actor. The Godfather is one of my favorite movies of all time!! Not only that, it is one of the greatest movies of all time!!!!!",10,0,2,18 January 2004
