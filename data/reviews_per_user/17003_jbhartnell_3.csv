The King's Speech," An accomplished bit of storytelling
","It's a known story so the plot is out there; the quality of the acting, which was simply superb, has been well documented; technically the film is shot well and it looks beautiful - but why is a film about a bloke with a stutter proving such a hit with critics and the public alike?It's a glimpse back to a period of time where the world was dramatically changing. The old Empires were collapsing, the Great War had an enormous impact on Europe with the threat of a greater war on the horizon. For the ruling elite things had also changed significantly, one of the key technological advance of the day was the precursor to 'Media' as we now know it. Where before you would have had printed court reports and you might have seen Royalty pass you briefly in a carriage, now you were hearing and seeing them as living breathing human beings. For our dear Bertie, the timing wasn't brilliant. The inclusion of these events was subtle but none the less still extremely valid to the film as it struck me that the future King George had a far greater understanding of his duty and what the country required to face the dark future looming - unlike his older brother . I'm sure there was artistic licence involved but from what I've read it has a ring of truth about it.Then there is the struggle to overcome what could be classed as a disability, not just for personal reasons but because it was vital that the country had a strong King at that time and the stammer could/would have been seen as a weakness. Again, I can't speak for anyone else but I was willing Bertie along with all my heart at the end of the film and felt extremely proud of him at the conclusion. A great film with a great story and great characters does that to you.I thought it was excellent.",9,1,2,14 February 2011
The Hunger Games," Full of guff and done far better before
",I knew hardly anything about the title before watching last night but I soon realised that it had to be an adaptation of a teen novel. It was the only way I could justify all the waffle and time wasting that went on. Nearly an hour passed before we even got a sniff of action and even then it was far more interesting in Running Man & Battle Royale.The plot holes gaped and the acting was wooden for the most part - Woody Harrelson was the stand out but that's not saying much.We ended up forwarding through swathes of the film just to try and find something interesting - we failed.Very poor and I hope the book is better or it shows a lack of class from the readership.,3,5,6,21 August 2012
Avatar," Literally Breathtaking!
","Saw Avatar today at the IMAX (I think Dubai only has one...) in 3D.It was interesting that afterwards, we went for dinner and both the wife and I sat there in total silence while we ate and once we had finished we both said the same thing.That planet, those people and those events happened! We've just lived through it.It is possibly the most immersive film I've ever seen. It is literally breathtaking.The plot is the weakest part - it has been done before with Dancing with Wolves and a number of other films - but I realised early on that it only adds to the experience. You can use the part of your brain that would normally be used to work out the twists and turns of a thriller and devote 100% to simply living in that world with those characters and experiencing what is going on.There isn't a huge amount of interaction between the CGI bods and the 'real' world but when there is, it is completely seamless - there's a bit right at the end where it does happen and it is simply 'real' and full of emotion.James Cameron is a director that I rate up there with Ridley Scott - they don't make bad films. OK, some of them may not be masterpieces but I'm yet to see a bad one from either of them. Titanic, while it may be a bit soppy, is still a brilliant piece of cinema and this is how Avatar is.I usually walk out of the cinema with a view that it was a good/OK/bad film etc... This, and this will sound strange, this made feel privileged to be allowed into their world, I found it that involving. When I think of the film now, sat at home, it's more like my own memories rather than a snapshot of a certain scene.I will be going to see it again on Thursday and I'm looking forward to spending even more time looking around and losing myself for a few hours.9.5/10",10,5,11,20 December 2009
