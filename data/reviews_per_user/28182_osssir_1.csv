Black Swan," Painful to watch,Avoid
","If you are a self-respectful heterosexual male, don't come anywhere near this movie, try your best to resist the attempt of your better half to make you go see this wretched spawn of hell itself! The plot of this movie consists of : 1)ankle twisting 2) bleeding 3) crying and self-pity 4)annoying horror segments 5) repeat all of the above a few times 6) and then she kills herself It's like a bad horror movie with ballet in it. Her delusions really make no sense at all and make this movie extremely painful to watch. On the bright side the acting is good, but it can't compensate for the extremely flowed concept of the plot and atmosphere.",1,8,16,30 January 2011
