Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Positive review from a professional film reviewer
","The Phantom Menace is a fine film very much in the tradition of Star Wars.  I know some nay-sayers will take issue that the story is simplistic and doesn't hint at the future events we know (from having seen Episodes IV, V and VI) are coming.  But Star Wars didn't really hint all that much at the events of Empire and Jedi either.  No, The Phantom Menace stands on it's own as a delightful treat full of visual splendour",7,0,0,22 May 1999
