Skyfall," 11 Fails
","1. The music. Adele sounds like she was at the dentist and had anesthetic injections which results in the mumbling and complete lack of diction or she had just woken up. It doesn't explain however her complete lack of vocal ability including any vocal range whatsoever. To make matters worse she even wrote the song, that sounded something like a toddler would put together. OMG I am updating this review, I have just learned that Adele got an Oscar for this AN Oscar!!!!!!!!! :-O2. Bond doesn't actually get the hard drive back. 3. Bond gets shot at the start and falls into a deep river and is rescued by the opening Bond Graphics. What was the big hand, a mermaid? Neptune? The big hole he sank into what was that? 4. M knew she was dying, so when Silva puts his head next to hers and then puts his gun next to her head and asks her to pull the trigger and kill them both. Why doesn't she? 5. The beautiful Severine could have been saved by Bond. She is made to stand with a glass on her head and Bond is forced to try and shoot the glass as a killer points a gun at him. Instead of using his gun to kill the man with the gun, he waits until she is murdered by Silva and only then does he use his gun to do so, so why did he not do it in the first place? It involved the same risk, the same movements. By waiting he gained nothing, just her death. 6. Bonds secrets. Why are we now forced to learn all about the Private life and History of Bond? No other Bond film had to resort to this. I think it is a sign of the times, celebrity has gone so far we even (according to Bond producers) need to know more about Bonds private life. This is a huge mistake, if they pick away at the layer of mystique that makes Bond so intriguing then he will no longer be Bond. 7. Bond crying when M dies. Bond does not cry ever, and now he does. 8. Bond walks past Tanner to see M. As he walks past him Tanner is slightly in the way and Bond has to twist his torso to get past. Directing mistake, Bond does not twist past people, they get out of the way, completely out of the way. Scene should have been retaken. 9. No gadgets. That's it no gadgets. 10. The Aston Martin. Gorgeous car but it's a museum piece now, they may as well use Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, use the McLaren MP4-12C Spider it's English and it's a Supercar, what is there to think about? 11. Is Bond Gay? When asked by Silva if he'd be interested in a first time poke at some cup cake sex, he says 'who says it's the first time'.Please let me write the next Bond, I'll do it for free. It will be set in Dubai involve a Helicopter chase through the centre gap of the Atlantis hotel. A fist fight on the monorail with the back drop of the city. A speed boat chase through the abandoned islands of 'The World'. Tons of gadgets, a bad guy who has a bodyguard who has a selection of bionics, such as a laser eye and super crush grip hands. Plus of course the McLaren MP4-12C Spider. I'd also introduce a recurring fun character (like Sheriff JW Pepper.)I am not swayed by any nonsense arguments that the audiences are too sophisticated for the classic style Bond. The new one is super lame and is very human, who needs a human Bond?",2,4,10,29 September 2013
Quantum of Solace," You disappoint me Mr Bond
","The title song was a dreary mess, so forgettable that I wager singer Alicia Keys couldn't even whistle it back.I am one of the multitude of life long Bond fans and I will defend Bond films whenever possible, on this occasion it however is not possible. Firstly the car chase at the beginning must have been great but the audience were not allowed to view it as the Director must have bought a shaky-cam add on and decided to get his monies worth, also the action kept cutting from cut to cut so fast that by the time your eyes were used to a frame it was gone, when the scene ended you knew you had seen something but weren't sure what. This was the same for all action sequences. Also (and maybe a tecky out there can explain this) the action scenes seemed to be filmed on less frames per second than standard, so it appeared staggered, all this will be explained as a Directors way of inducing action, but it failed to do so, it just induced a headache.I know all Bonds and all Bond films go through phases, some are moody and some are lighter, there is no one mood that we should expect, however I venture to say that there is a mood that we shouldn't expect, that mood being depressing. The film's mood is considerably depressing throughout, with no one liners, no tongue in cheek and no cheeky banter. Any Director who sees their own ambition superior to that of the Bond Genre should step aside, if they want to make an overly dark Bond in some draining selfish ambition to be remembered as creating a 'different Bond', then choose another film. Anyone can make a film with one theme, it's the magic of Bonds gone by that could combine drama, action, excitement, sadness and fun that will be remembered.One of the great things about Bonds is that anything is possible Bond can go into outer space survive incredible leaps etc, so as audiences we can be expected to believe him in any situation. However I found my support waining with his plan to rescue his femme Fatale who was being held in an open speed boat by 7 guards all with Sub machine guns, and the boat itself was surrounded by more boats with more guards with sub machine guns, so Bond Kamakazi style rams his boat into the boat on a suicide mission, at one point he is being chased by the pursuing boats who are about one metre behind him showering him with a storm of bullets making it inconceivable that he and the girl didn't get killed instantly, the scene resembles something from Naked Gun I actually LOL I imagined Leslie Neilson in the pursuing boat.Another irritating item was the fact that this was a sequel, I couldn't remember the details of Casino Royale and more importantly I didn't expect to have to. Why is this Bond a sequel no other Bonds have been! sure there may be elements that tie certain Bonds together, but each Bond movie should be standalone, what happens if someone walks in and rents a Quantum of Solace DVD does it have a prerequisite statement on the cover! or for those who QOS was there first Bond?! they must have been very disappointed (and confused).Daniel Craig was great, I hope the next film gives him something he deserves. Plus he has now stopped that curious pouting.",4,5,8,20 December 2008
I Am Legend," Even IMAX can't squeeze adrenaline from this
","By choosing IMAX I assume the idea was to help stimulate a 'scared' response from the viewers, I understand this suggestion, and I would wager that part of the production team came up with this suggestion AFTER they saw the script, as the technology needed to make this film scary 'Throw the audience of a ledge a vision' hasn't been perfected yet.I can't understand why a film inspired so obviously by 28 days later never learned anything from its idol. For example the very reason why 28 days later was terrifying was because the ghouls were human, not almost human, not CGI, but human. It is the very idea that Humans could be responsible, just by a change in nature to become the raging monsters that terrified us so much in 28 days later. Therefore why did the director choose to distance us from such a possibility and 'possibility' is the key to this type of terror, the likelihood of it happening for real is what makes this genre scary when done correctly. Instead he chose the worst CGI I have ever seen (they even CGI a Lion (Badly) why don't we have real lions? or trees for that matter?), each ghoul had the same features, why? they all looked like London cycle couriers, they just lacked the laptop saddlebag with the strap that femininely goes across the chest! and more importantly they DID NOT LOOK REAL, this is an absolutely important point THEY DID NOT LOOK REAL. The lack of 'real' makes things unreal which again relaxes the audience as they know it's not REEEEAAAALLLLL.The Director also owes Will Smith, he delivered his lines with 100% commitment, the script was so poor, weak and lame that it drew attention to the mechanics of the film and its film making, as one became aware of this serious weakness, nevertheless Will Smith persevered, and even cried in one scene so top marks. I also cried, but only because I remembered that the Director and script writer of this rubbish would be a lot richer than me.",1,5,7,13 November 2009
Pretty Woman," No one hates this film more than me
","I have just given a 10 for Thieves Highway, I mention this for two reasons one to prove I'm not a git who only gives bad reviews but 2 because the theme of the film has the same thread namely the falling in love with a woman of the night.We all know pretty Woman is a chick flick but you can't avoid them all, they'll eventually get you. Pretty Woman for me does two things, two terrible horrible ghastly things, firstly it portrays prostitution as a career more akin to that of a dancer, you know with absolutely great friends, leg warmers lots of giggling, borrowing each others make up. You see in the reality of Pretty Woman the prostitute and this is a street walker Prostitute we're talking about here, has a great life, she's healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament. My feeling is this 'happy Hooker' type protagonist is a lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character, which for me begs the question if you make a movie about a type of person but are too chicken scared to adorn that player with the characteristics familiar to that role then why do it? If I make a film about a chef but don't want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat then why make a film about a chef in the first place? By bailing out and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story misses the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the moral or social questions that it could have, what a cop out, really really lame. Secondly, 'Pretty Woman' insults romance itself, Edward Lewis played by Richard Gere has no clue how to seduce or romance this 'lady' that is without his plastic friend, yep don't leave home without it, especially if you are a moron in a suit who has no imagination. 8 out of 10 of his romantic moments involve splashing cash in one way or another, even when he first meets her it's the Lotus Esprit turbo that does all the work, necklaces here diamonds there limos over there, money money money, where's the charm? where's the charisma, don't mention that attempt at the piano please.Girls who like this film will also be girls who like shopping more than most. Guys who like this film will not even have realized that old Eddy has less charm than a calculator, as they probably don't either so it wont have registered. More importantly anyone who likes this film will hate 'Thieves Highway' a wonderful story of which part is based on the same subject.I'll finish on a song:Pretty woman hangin round the street Pretty woman, the kind I like to treat Pretty woman, I don't believe you You're not the truth No one could spend as much as you MercyPretty woman, wont you pardon me Pretty woman, I couldn't help but see Pretty woman, and you look lovely as can be do you lack imagination just like mePretty woman, shop a while Pretty woman, talk a while Pretty woman, sell your smile to me Pretty woman, yeah, yeah, yeah Pretty woman, look my way Pretty woman, say you'll stay with me..and I'll pay you..I'll treat you right",1,32,63,3 September 2009
