Mission: Impossible III," Great in so many aspects
","A very good addition to the series. A great movie after the first one. MI:II is must not be considered an MI movie, but this one here builds the foundation to take the series further. We get an insight of Hunt's life. The driving force of the MI series is Hunt's dilemmas. The movie begins to get into the MI universe with showing us what Hunt is made of and why he chooses what he chooses in the next films.
The actions were a plus point, very few overuse of action is encountered. The action were basic nevertheless. But still the movie gives away many of Hunt's super spy skills like lip reading and webslinging across building. Got to say, Hunt is very lucky to survive so many life and death situation.The acting was on point, the other characters other than Hunt hadn't have any significant challenges in acting considering the calibre of them. Tom Cruise grew as an actor and it showed if his performance from first two filmshas to be considered.
I wish the movie was less predictable and avoided the cliches. It's a good movie to pass your time.",7,1,1,4 March 2020

Spider-Man: Homecoming," Not good, not bad.
","Nothing new except for the worst opening scene in the MCU history.
A mainstream action film which stands on a foundation created by the previous MCU movie. The plot is not good enough.",6,0,0,27 July 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," What did I just watch!
","It's epic in one word. It is something, nobody has ever seen in cinema. The story revolves around Miles Morales, a kid from Brooklyn. Kingpin creates a collider which opens portal for parallel universes. Miles and other spidys team up to resolve the abnormality.
The movie is so well made that there is literally no dull moment. The visuals are splendid. It felt like you are going through a great comic book and it is your imaginative world. The travellers from other universes pursued great character depth. The movie seems so comically realistic that you will be familiar with the laws of the cinematic-verse within the first half. The first half of the movie was too good. Then second half did justice to the first half. It is a never seen before experience.Surely a must watch.",10,3,6,9 January 2019
