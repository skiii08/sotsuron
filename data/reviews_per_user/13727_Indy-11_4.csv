The Ring," Shameful
","Over used devices in horror movies/TV shows:1. Disturbed children drawing strange pictures of things they 'see'. 2. Seattle as a rainy, dark city. 3. Using the same 'Dies Irae' theme for music over and over again. 4. The use of a telephone call to scare the victims.I'm surprised Spielberg would allow his studio to put their name on it. Maybe they were thinking the audience would confuse the title with another ring movie beginning with 'Lord of'...",3,1,2,21 October 2002
I'm Not There," Who greenlit this crap?
","It's hard to believe something this bad was approved by some producers somewhere. Tedious, pretentious, and rambling are just a few words to describe this hodgepodge of many turds.The ineptitude of the script and the corny accents and dialogue made this unwatchable. I was hoping to learn more about Dylan's life and music. Instead I got a rambling, incoherent, unorganized, slop of a film. In addition, Dylan's music just isn't that great to begin with, and the choices for the film certainly don't help.Hopefully, someday, a good film may be made about Dylan and his music; this is not it.",1,6,8,2 September 2011
Windtalkers," New category of film
","Is it an action film? Is it a war film? I think it's WARCTION!I will join the majority here and vote this not only one of the worst WAR films of all time, but of the WORST films of all time. No plot, just many, many explosions. You WILL get a headache. Every bomb looks the same, from a grenade, to a satchel charge, to a mine, to a mortar shell, to bombs fired from off-shore battleships. Ridiculous! Our Navajo Indian hero,Beach, has two expressions: stupid smirk and meditative s√©ance eye rolling.Endless moronic scenes made me wish the movie blew up in my DVD player- even fast forwarding through much of it, the film still felt 3 hours long. Why would such a perceived valuable soldier be sent on such small missions with such a high level of danger: what value would he provide? How is it possible the two of them always know the coordinates of where to radio for bombs even though they have no maps? I actually laughed out loud when they got to the final portion of the island, and we see the closeup of the REALLY, REALLY BIG Japanese gun. Uh oh, the US is in trouble now! Other laughable scenes include the completely ridiculous decapitation and subsequent grenade toss, and the chocolate bar toss- both unforgettable for their complete stupidity.",1,2,4,3 August 2006
Hustle & Flow," Shockingly awful
","Not since 'Daylight' and 'John Q' have I been as offended by black stereotypes in the movies.The message is something about reaching for a dream. Even if you are a pimp who abuses, sells drugs and can't form a coherent sentence, you can have dreams. The portrayal of DJay by Terrence Howard is no better than your average SNL sketch- I can't believe the high regard the critics have for this film and the acting in it.We are meant to somehow empathize with the lead character even though he beats up a defenseless man, shoots another innocent man, and even when being led away by the police, he says nothing about taking care of the supposed woman who was closest to him- he only cares about the pad with his crappy lyrics on it. Ridiculous.The music(if you consider rap music) was annoying, repetitive, and completely unrealistic (gosh, that was the quickest voice lesson in history, given by a guy who doesn't even sing!). The writing and recording of the songs were the slowest parts(among many)of the film- thankfully the remote was nearby.Here's a good idea for a movie: an African American who is a politician overcomes deep prejudice in his own country to become President of the United States.",2,1,3,26 January 2009
