Resident Evil: Afterlife," Very Mediocre Film In Every Aspect ( keep in mind I am a fanatic of the video game series )
","I'm sure this has been reiterated a lot, but this series of films is drifting further and further away from any concept of the original ideas ( from the video games themselves. ) With that being said, it's not entirely a bad idea to go on that path, but the films are terribly inconsistent with each other. The 1st film was good & suspenseful like a RE movie should be. The 2nd was tolerable and somewhat within the plot of RE. The 3rd was the beginning of an end.I truly like some Anderson's work as a director ( Mortal Kombat, RE, Event Horizon ) but this was a terrible concoction.Milla is a solid actress and on-screen performer, but did we really need to hear her sulk & pout about some plot that's completely irrelevant to the franchise? I mean it's bogus how conflicting the plots are to begin with.As for the 3D graphics ( this is the 1st & only film I've seen in 3D in theatres ) I was utterly disappointed. Most notably when Alice throws some ninja star type weapons at the camera. I mean, Underworld: Evolution had an almost duplicate scene like that without any 3D and it blows the outcome away. The only 3D viewing I enjoyed from this movie was the Executioner Majini's wet-room fight.You could say the film is unpredictable and will leave you on the edge of your seat, but it also makes you question it in every instance.This film series would have been a tonne more appreciated & acclaimed if it had followed the video games more closely and not drifted off. I tolerated the 1st few with a completely made up main character / protagonist because I was elated to see the series come to films. But this film draws the line, sadly I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.Let me put it this way; when Tomb Raider video games came to the big screen they only needed a babe ( Jolie ) to fill any void and do some action, because there's not much history or plot to the games, sheer action. But Resident Evil follows a strict timeline and maintains a pretty consistent synopsis throughout the main games ( RE,RE2,RE3NEMESIS,RECODEVERONICA,RE4,RE5. ) I don't understand how in the 3rd instalment of Anderson's films has the whole world gone deserted, left to an underground secret agency.The biggest grudge about this movie itself ( and the series ) is Wesker is only introduced in Extinction... He's a vital part of the 1st video game and an evolving storyline. This film series may as well have been called something else, like Biolulzard. It goes from a serious film ( RE ) to a comical flick ( Apocalypse ) to a paranormal caravan ( Extinction ) and lastly a psycho drama ( After-Life. ) If there's another in the works, sure I'll watch it because Anderson is capable of quality, but this is a glaring example of misrepresentation. Capcom should not have let you go on with a 3rd and 4th movie. I sincerely hope Capcom allows a new team to interpret a new series of films/remakes.",5,1,3,20 October 2010
