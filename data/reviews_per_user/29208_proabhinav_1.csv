Hereditary," Good one !!
","Well written and directed , besides a great acting by everyone in the movie. Every time when stories are repeated with narratives, it takes something different to turn the clock 360 degrees, this movie may be one of them. Movie is way apart from the regular horrors we have been introduced, mysterious till the end, loss of granny followed by sequence of strange incidents in the lives of the family will grip you till the end. Great sound score, acting and screenplay is both scary nd much needed fun at times.I must say, last time a fresh perspective to horror was Insidious by James Wann, Hereditary has Again turned the clock 360 degree to bring something new for us ..Only dissapointment I have is a few critical scenes are cut, courtesy the great Indian cbfc ..",8,0,2,24 June 2018
