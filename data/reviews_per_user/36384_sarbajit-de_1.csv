Despicable Me 2," The Minions are probably one of the funniest characters ever created.
","My review of 'Despicable Me2':Got to watch 'Despicable Me' - the first part just a few days back.Yes I know I was very late and was surely left wondering at the end of it 'Just what the hell took me so long to watch this piece of animation all this while?'.It was downright enjoyable so with the hilarious trailers of the sequel hitting the scene I was like all eager to watch it in 3D at the theatre. There are only a very few movies which I go and watch on the big screen unless its running at my favorite theatre in town coz of the EXPerience factor. 'Despicable Me' was really good and the the trailers of this sequel were so convincing that it had to be one of those exceptional cases. The first part was definitely original and introduced us to the amazingly cute and hilarious world of minions - the tiny yellow beings :) 'Despicable Me 2' borrows the theme and builds on from its predecessor and takes it to a whole new level. The story is kept quite simple while focusing on the character development of its protagonist the 'Gru'. There are different shades to Gru's character which we get to witness in this one. He is quite a different man now in this one from the one we used to know in the first half of 'Despicable Me'. His affectionate, protective, romantic ( or not so romantic at times ) and caring nature is revealed. The three girls whom he had adopted also are quite smart now and one can't simply resist oneself but fall for the irresistible cuteness of the youngest of them Agnes. I mean there quite a few scenes between Gru and her which would melt your heart and make you go 'Aawwwwww....'. The introduction of the character of Lucy as the eccentric and sweet spy agent is very well done. No I won't give away spoilers here but you will know what I am talking about once you watch it :) But for me the show stealers got to be the incredibly unique minions. Hats off to the person(or team) in whose mind the idea of creating such characters was born.I mean there are hundreds of them and if you ask me they account for the funniest parts of the movie. They are adorable , confused, cute and convincingly funny little beings.Lets talk about the voice overs now. After watching the first part I felt that Steve Carell as the voice of Gru couldn't have done it any better but honestly he beat me to it. I mean being a non Latino himself how does he manage to pull off that kind of Hispanic accent with so much ease? Hats off to this man really who also happens to be one of the funniest American celebrities. OK now Gru is at least human but how to manage to voice over for one of the funniest characters ever 'the Minions' ? Leave that job to Pierre Coffin and what you get is an unique and downright hilarious dialect even though you don't understand most of it lol. I mean I still can't get over that 'Silas Ramsbottom. bottom ..hehehaha..' part really. There's a song sung by the Minions at the end. Let me know what you think of it.Technically the film is gorgeous. With the skill level of the artists and animators and with the kind of high end equipment at their disposal almost every 3D animation movie looks eye candy in recent times. So I would not say I saw something groundbreaking which I haven't seen lately. But this in no way undermines the quality of animation which 'Despicable Me 2' has to offer. Specially loved the fur and the water effects.The 3D is nice and it has its moments for sure in some of the scenes. In terms of overall feel of depth throughout the length of the movie however I felt that 'Epic' had the edge.The 3D was smoother and more consistent in 'Epic' but it isn't bad at all in 'Despicable Me2'. If you want to see more of it wait till the main end credits start rolling and you will get to witness some 'in your face' kind of 3D minion action :)Apart from its technical brilliance what really made this movie shine and such a joy ride for me was the characterisation, the human touch and the insanely hilarious quotient. I normally am not used to laughing out loud at the theatre but this one really had me and during some scenes I was not able to control it at just the giggling level. This movie will be loved by kids and adults alike. If you have watched and loved 'Despicable Me' then I am sure you would want to go out and enjoy this FUN ride as well.",8,0,1,5 July 2013
