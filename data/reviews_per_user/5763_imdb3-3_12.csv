Scarface," Pretty terrible acting by Pacino, entertaining if you get by it
","Way too long, way overrated and this movie is only saved by performances of every actor except Pacino. Nobody knows what accent he's trying to emulate and his attempt to wear a perpetual frown comes off as comical, cartoonish. It's too bad because this otherwise overlong movie is saved by a cast of fantastic character actors that raise the amperage all the way through the movie.This movie is about the rise and fall of a nobody immigrant with a mean streak who hails from Cuba. Being honest, I had a hard time listening to Pacino opening up his mouth and grimacing, trying to act bad and angry. Many worship this movie as if it's a lesser Godfather but it's hard to put it aside with every scene that Pacino sounds like an Italian who swallowed a Spaniard with speech impediment. You just have too laugh.Even the famous lines from this movie are meant to be laughable, over the top moments, the same you'd have from your average B movie, which this is with just MUCH better production value, actors and sets. This isn't anywhere near a Top 250 movie of all time albeit it's much better than your average B movie. Take it for what it's worth.",5,1,4,24 April 2016
The Expendables 2," Painfully bad, including the fake punches
","The synopsis here: 'Mr. Church reunites the Expendables for what should be an easy paycheck, but....'Well that was an easy paycheck and the story ends! This is bad B- Movie entertainment with a big budget. Too much money and too many stars for it to fall this flat. It's made for Mystery Science Theater 3000 as a film to talk back to the screen and laugh at as the really bad jokes flop, one after another.I knew we were going to have a problem when Stallone, now well past his prime, goes into a bar with Statham and take on the really, really huge guy. You can see one of them flop to the ground after Stallone visibly swings wide and completely misses the target. That scene epitomizes this film. You are left wondering whether there was editing and, if it was edited, they just said 'screw it. These idiots who came to see our first movie won't give a damn. They are here for the big names, our recycled dumb lines, big explosions and bad villains we hate. Plot? We don't need no stinking plot! Let's just serve us up a sexy Chinese woman and we are golden.'What a stinker. Humor is forced right down your throat that is painful. Leading to action scenes that looked like they were staged on a set in Hollywood. Nobody in the street but 100 guys with submachine guns taking on a handful of our heroes. Thousands of rounds are fired and yet not one of these idiots can even come close to hitting our heroes. Even massive artillery doesn't help with their aim. The film should have just treated itself as a total comedy right from the start. It's really that bad.",1,0,1,17 March 2016
Passengers," Frustrating. Great premise, many well done parts, laziest script ever
","The film look great. Lots of excellent special effects to make it convincing. Excellent cast. Compelling story. Very funny parody of what life may be like in the future. But boy does it ever fall flat as a board towards the end. And the ending is rushed, lame, pitiful and quite unbelievable. The first hour is set up in a little quickly but it works, in spite of some stilted dialogue and scenes that should have been redone so that they didn't feel as if they were scripted and unnatural. But that's a minor quibble given how much I liked the premise and much of where the story was going. Pratt plays a man on a 120 year or so trip to another colony in space to live in luxury. This premise is completely absurd for many reasons (such as what you'll see in the movie.) During the journey he awakens very early after an asteroid strikes the ship and causes a malfunction. And he can't go back into hibernation (why... good question. Perhaps they thought the ship would never suffer the problem.) And he finds himself alone... very alone. And as a result he must make some difficult choices.Jennifer Lawrence obviously appears in the film. She does a great job with what she's been handed. Michael Sheen as the bartender is perfectly cast although very little is done with him. The real problems are contrivance that begin to work their way into being positively annoying and dumb when 'the twist' happens during the film that changes the course of everything. It's the kind of mistake that shouldn't have been made because the character wouldn't make such a mistake. And from there the film ends up traveling at light speed towards phony. It never recovers from that fatal misstep.It's unfortunate that a film with the potential for so many great directions falls so flat in the second half. And for this reason I've given the film a very generous 6. You may really enjoy the atmosphere and the premise. But when it fails you may feel cheated by a very lazy effort. It's disappointing. Could have been a top film of the year.",6,2,4,11 January 2017
The Hateful Eight," What the hell was this dreck?
","Wow. Believe those who were bewildered by what an awful film this is. To quote Tarantino, those who are giving this film a high rating 'have their mouth on my big ***** johnson'. It's really that terrible.So you've heard this is a western. Well, it's not really a western. And it's not really historical even though it plays like it is supposed to have some profound insight into the hatred of the black man rooted way back into civil war times. But unlike Django which was just way too long and a bit too ridiculous in its blaxploitation parody in the second half of the film, this one insults the viewer by not even being interesting. 90+ minutes of endless talking that takes place mostly in a stagecoach and a cabin. How this movie cost $62 million is beyond me unless Tarantino was paid by the word.And like M. Night Shylaman or whatever his name is, Tarantino likes to fit himself into his own films. He's also usually very out of place. This time he completely outdoes himself and provides for an epic WTF moment that lasts a solid few minutes to finally kick this old dog in the rump to move it. You'll know the moment when you see it.The writing is terrible. You've got a paranoid bounty hunter who is on the extreme end to make sure he doesn't lose his prize. Yet he does some things so absurdly out of character that can only be explained by a need to move the pieces into place. And the film is so poorly navigated that it feels as though Tarantino himself had to step in to steer it in a direction. You have to guess that a test audience must have given them the indication that the film was such a mess that it needed navigation.And what was just a poor movie that was over the top goes full retard. Only Tarantino would have been given the green light to make this dull, flat, go nowhere 'whodunit' movie that's like a sad version of Clue. It's painfully funny to read Tarantino fanatics talk about their second and third viewings of this film. This is like a bad parody of bad parodies of bad westerns and Clue bound together with nothing to say except for n*gg*r. This was no period piece like Django was, which was a mediocre and horribly long film saved only by having the best acting talent on the planet saving the film. At least that film had entertaining moments and a story that moved between long fluffy lulls. This entire film could be summarized in one paragraph.First 95 minutes - introduce the characters. Last 80 minutes - a really slow, ultra talky bad version of clue. And Senor Bob was such a clownish character, you have to wonder whether Tarantino was trying to see how bad of a movie could be made and still watch enough critics say that something happened and that Tarantino's dialogue is entertainingly clever. It's not. Save yourself. Prepare yourself. The 8.0 rating is faked.",1,24,44,31 January 2016
Now You See Me," Would be good if it didn't deceive the audience
","I wanted to like this film and it did show some early promise. But for a film that relies upon illusions, this one provides the worst fraud of all - the CGI that is responsible for pulling off the most of the tricks. The entire film is predicated on these guys being the greatest magicians of all and they couldn't even pull off the simple ones without some help from Hollywood.And then came the ridiculous trick about moving money between bank accounts. Who came up with this garbage? Anything is possible in this film because anything is possible in movie land. While it has high production value, it's all wasted on a pitiful script. If you want to see some strange magic inspired movie, see something like The Prestige. At least that is honest to its inspiration, unlike this one which is virtually all made up rubbish that only exists in movies.",4,0,1,29 May 2016
It Follows," Hysterically bad, someone slept with the reviewers
","Was on cable and came to the IMDb for reviews. Shockingly good rating all around. The story seemed ridiculous and watching just five minutes made me laugh that this ever got funded. The writers came up with yet another dumb derivative of the 'if you do this, the thing will stalk you.' But hey... let's make this happen if you have sex!!! People will want to see the movie for the naked action!!!! Well... get ready for disappointment all the way around.The writers didn't bother to create any story. None. They came up with this concept and basically said 'let's try to keep this crap going for like 90+ minutes' without bothering to explain what is going on, no reasons, no rules, no boundaries. And that's a good thing because there is no explanation for what goes on because then they'd have to make sense of it all. So why does 'it' follow in super slow motion to make sure that victims can get away in time to infect another person to keep the story going. Well... except of course if you want to tease with a shocking scene that is enough to induce laughs (you'll know it when you see it.)The only thing this movie is good for is to show young teenagers that premarital sex is bad bad bad. You never know what can happen... like this. Be scared. Of movie ratings. Scary amount of manipulation going on.",1,50,98,27 April 2016
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Worse than I imagined, instant sequel not worth seeing
","I was wondering whether the torrent of terrible reviews was some type of trickery because so many critics claimed to have loved this film. My first thought when it ended was 'what the hell did I just watch?' Without spoiling the film, here's a list of everything why this film was such a clunker.1) If you've ever watched the first 3 films that started this story, you have to wonder whether the writers ever did. The personalities simply don't match.2) There are so many 'wink wink' nod to the past film moments that it becomes laughable, making you wonder whether they ran out of money and the writers just said 'aw hell, let's just recreate the same scenes and some of the dialog from prior films! Fans will love it!' Ummm.... no. It's contrived.3) Many of the numerous jokey scenes fall flat on their butts.4) Far fetched escapes is suspending disbelief. This film has repeated miracle moments and made for drama. Must totally disconnect brain for this film. Entirely.5) The rules of the force and logic are broken repeatedly. Stuff happens when it does because it needs to. And it's obvious.6) The ending of the movie, which I won't give away, is simply made for a sequel. And it ends the way it does because, if it didn't, they'd have to figure out a whole new sequel and excuse to keep this rubbish afloat.7) I now understand why Mark Hamil was so outspoken about this film with criticism over treatment of Skywalker. It was hilariously bad and pitiful. The word 'lame' has been redefined. They could have had the story go in hundreds of different directions. This one felt like they couldn't figure one out so they chose the one that took the least effort. 8) I don't know whether the director wants to promote some type of romantic connection between these new young lead characters. It seems like Rian Johnson wasn't sure either. And let me tell you that what they've got feels ice cold.9) I disagree that casting a woman as a Jedi was a bad or forced idea.Daisy Ridley does a great job given what she was given. She might be the only thing half keeping the movie together. But ultimately there is really nothing behind all the mumbo jumbo. And as the film goes on, you realize that her job is to sound strong, act cool and be a good baddie. I'm not sure what she really does.10) Either characters were written into the script to do someone a favor (Benicio Del Toro) or this has to be the laziest job of script writing I've seen in a long time. You could see certain plot points happen from a mile away. You almost wanted to scream at the characters in the film about what you're seeing as the audience. That's not a good place to be.There is a lot more I could say about this film and the best I can say is that the visuals make this film look beautiful. But it is a painful watch. There is only one thing for sure. This is the last Jedi as you've known it. It seems like Rian Johnson wants to take this brand in a different direction but now it's as generic as any other space war film. I think too many of the critics didn't want to anger Disney too much with a bad review, which is why you saw a ridiculous number of laudatory reviews.",1,1,1,14 January 2018
Taken," Action Porn with Liam Neeson, Step up from Chuck Norris
","The first half hour of this film is the set up. It's difficult which person is more detestable - Neeson's ex-wife for playing the part of the narcissistic, condescending b-word or the daughter for being the self-obsessed, over the top, annoying spoiled teenage brat. You hope either or both get offed and quickly. But it doesn't turn out that way because Neeson cares about both of them, including holding the candle for the ex for reasons that aren't clear.What follows is some action porn as the daughter gets taken and it's time for Neeson to spring to action with his 'special set of skills.' He does a very good job of playing the action hero with superior skills and also capable of making the bad guys miss every time, including with their automatic weapons. As poor as this film should be, Neeson somehow carries it the rest of the way which is about 50 minutes of sheer action and pretty fast paced fun. Some didn't like the political ploy of using the bad morals of the middle east to portray. Bear it or go to one of those countries and you'll begin to accept the sad reality that things like this aren't really that far fetched as crazy as that may seem and might be a little over the top.Overall this gets all the stars for fun action. The dialogue during the set up is laughable and painful. But the last 50 minutes make it fun. Don't worry if you make dinner during the first thirty and then enjoy the best part. This one is all Neeson.",6,2,2,28 June 2016
The Matrix Reloaded," It was even worse the second time...
","I was able to see this movie in comfort for a second go round. I have to say that it was worth what I paid for it.... nothing.Funny how so many of these people think this movie is 'mindblowing' because it discusses philosophical concepts. Unfortunately the story line is an excuse to force great sounding round concepts into a square plot.Somehow the machines found Zion, perhaps the Palestinians alerted them (Get it? That's a deep, subtle reference too.) Long boring emotional speeches using optimistic euphamisms only spoken from Hollywood. Throw in plot twist and the most superficial coverage of characters I have ever seen. If you want character development, this is definitely not your movie. In fact, I'd say this movie regresses and you know (and think) even less of the characters that you saw in the first, especially Trinity and especially Morpheus, who was most compelling and is now reduced to Sideshow Bob.The movie continues to CGI graphics up the wazoo, which makes you wonder (1) if the matrix is nothing but a mind game, why did Neo have to fly for miles just to get to the 'action scene' -- why not be there instantly, and (2) why the heck doesn't Neo just fly away every time he gets in trouble because we know he can't 'beat them' by just handfighting with everyone. Ridiculous. This isn't deep, it's Hollywood fx to keep the kiddies happy and the video game commercials rolling.Part three: Some ridiculous interlude with a Frenchman and two cool looking dudes. Why this had to be in the film probably had a lot more to do with current events than ingenuity. I had no idea why Persephone's character mattered at all and how much she gave up 'for a kiss.' It was a poor excuse to throw in something that seemed clever along with a line I'm sure the Wachowski's were yukking up saying 'we GOTTA stick this line in somewhere because it's too good to waste!!!'OK, part three. This could have been somewhat interesting but by this point, who cares? The part with the oracle and the creator were slightly interesting but also more blockheaded philosphy. The first matrix was interesting because we didn't know what it was. This film tries to capture the same sensation but instead throws existentialist questions at us all at one time, giving us the same thought provoking self analysis of the universe as we heard when the students were smoking pot in 'Animal House.'End of movie throws in a plot twist with Agent Smith... yes, we know where this is going now in the finale. It's like a TV episode of Star Trek TNG. Why the sidekick was in the movie at the beginning and end is beyond me because he played no part and was just annoying. Yes, we do know what will happen in Part III -- the issue of Morpheus' ex-girlfriend (how riveting, I could't care less because we never saw any exchange or development of it in this movie), more of Neo and Trinity's growing lust (oops, love, but I didn't see any of that did you?), more fights with a more powerful agent smith (coming to Playstation IV), and some more incomprehensible dialogue with the designer of the matrix (which made some sense but the choices were not correct, predictable, as are this movie.)So what are we left with? A movie that tries so hard to be clever with subtle references that it misses the mark on the most important part of the movie -- a comprehensible plot that flows, character development, a good script, and a cohesive and compelling story. Choice is an illusion if you feel compelled to see this movie, however, given the detailed reviews one might say that this is a rental at best and part 3 is irrelevant already... the Matrix is a movie that never should have had a sequel but with the moneymaking potential we may have a dozen...",1,2,3,9 June 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," A Phantom Menace
","I was looking forward to seeing this film. Wow... with the limited expectations I had I couldn't believe how poor this stinker really was.The first Matrix should have been left alone, just like the original Star Wars did not need Lucas to help the world understand his glory by creating Duds Episode One and Two. Well, thanks to the Wachowskis, we now have Phantom Menace 2003. But give Lucas credit -- at least the plot made sense and you understood the awful dialogue.The opening scene gives away the entire movie -- Trinity does her kick ass routine with the special effects that made the Matrix interesting. Do we really need to see this opening... again? Ah yes, of course, since this time it's longer and provides even more special fx. Wowee.Run into long first hour with nothing but boring shots of Zion, pontificating, speeches with powerful words that could be summed up in a sentence, and the lust between Trinity and Neo that is a relationship colder than the colors in this film.Now let's get to the plot. Agent Smith now talks some gobbledygook about being released from the machine which means he can replicate himself. Uh... didn't we see something like this in the first movie? If the machines could send 'sentinels' why couldn't the matrix send 1,000 of them? Of course they could but there wouldn't be any suspense in the fighting scenes. But I digress because people here actually think they 'got' the brilliance of the film.We introduce several new characters who ultimately seem to have nothing to do with the story and will undoubtedly appear for cameos in the final film, those being Merivingian and the twins. Were they needed? No, but the Wachowskis decided that the Matrix needed to have a diabolical villian for a really cool, long fight and car chase.Visiting the Oracle again... no spoiler but suffice it to say that there is a little twist thrown in but nothing overwhelming. More confusing nonsense about metaphysics, choice, fate, blah, blah, blah. Then we hear more about some absolutely preposterously absurd plot about what it really all means. My thought was -- you MUST be joking. After the great idea in the original film it all comes down to this stinker?Make no mistake. This is not a thought provoking film and all the philosophical debate in the film does not make it any smarter than this film is. It's an excuse to make another Matrix film. The money was just so big so it was going to be done, as was the third. My guess is that if the box office is big for the third, the Wachowskis will begin to do the trilogy that happened before the original Matrix and this series will be known as The Matrix episodes IV, V, and VI.Pros - nice effects, style, high budget production. Cons - dumb film with few redeeming moments, first hour boring as hell, overlong effects and fights to cover up the lack of plot, zero true character development, some pretty bad dialogue, second rate acting, and a story intended to confuse so it can have teenagers yapping about something that they think is deep. Pathetic. Insulting. Happy as heck I didn't have to pay to see this tripe.",1,1,1,17 May 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Weakest of the Three
","If you make your way through the thousands of teens, Lord of the Rings junkies, and all the others who voted this movie a 10 for reasons other than a pure movie rating, you'll find that this is easily the weakest of the three films, unfortunately.Pro: It was a good movie and for the most part, entertaining. The characters are well cast, the CGI is good in most places, the actors are good enough to save questionable editing and the scenery is still breathtaking. Great effects in battle... you'll see. Worth the $10 to see but not really one you want to see again without having the ability to skip portions.Cons:1) Way, way too long and poor editing choices. SPOILER --> The multiple endings was totally preposterous and belongs in the extended DVD version for fanzies. Remember, this is a movie, not the book. That time would have been much better spent on main characters that never surfaced, e.g. Saruman whom you never saw again and Sauron who was reduced to nothing more than a lighthouse. Oh yeah, I felt how dangerous he was. You will get restless at the end of the movie and will laugh your head off as to how awfully campy and forced it feels (especially when Frodo wakes up and the silly canned laughter begins...)2) Too much time wasted at the beginning of the film as well. Mr. Jackson, pick your choices of what to develop. The love story and relationship between get any concern for the relationship. Too bad. Too much crap with Merry and Pippin... please, enough of the Hobbit details crap and focus on the main characters. Honestly, I didn't feel like I really cared so much about many of the characters because there was so much cutting between scenes and an incredible amount of time spent on Faramir and his going mad father, an odd area to place so much time.3) Gimli and Legolas again reduced to nothing more than comic relief and incredibly cool and unrealistic CGI hero. There was practically no dialogue with Legolas at all. The reduction of these characters made me care less about Legolas and made the girl I went with happy the one or two time she saw him but wondered why he was nothing but occasional screen candy.4) The movie felt very tired. Gollum again steals the show.5) Some of the battle scenes were tired. A lot of quick cutaways and not as much feel of the one on one combat like you had in the first films. Also very, very poor display assistance of the dead -- it was as though they used up the budget for CGI and had this wave of green just end the huge number of Sauron's army in 10 seconds while the other characters hung out to chat. It was like a comic strip video game.Honestly, I didn't feel like I really cared so much about the characters at the end and felt like the ring was reduced to nothing more than an overblown reason to have a quest. I truly think this movie suffers from wasted time at the beginning and end, too many battle scenes and too little time to continue to develop the great dialogue and character development of earlier movies.My rating would place this film a very good 7.5 but that is as high as I'd go. Definitely bring some nourishment, wear comfy clothes and a watch...",1,63,172,20 December 2003
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Brilliant Witty Quasi Musical
","Any semi-intelligent person should be reasonably amused with any production by the Coen Brothers since incredible care is placed into mocking the specific characteristics of common ordinary people. O' Brother Where Art Thou is another success which, like other Coen Brothers films, has a number of messages for the viewer in the course of a film that has several, oddly connected and hilarious scenes.The dialogue is witty and in this film, a good amount of bluegrass music is interspersed with the theatre-like dialogue. Initially it takes a little getting used to in sliding into the concocted dialogue. But what really takes the cake in this film are the incredible performances by all the actors who each have their moment to shine.Clooney is remarkably good as Ulysses, the leader of the pack of convicts who escape a chain gang and wander into the wild, crazy, and mad world of the early 20th century. They come face to face with a number of characters that are included not only for the comedy, but much for the messages that the characters seem to give to the audience through their dialogue. What is wonderful is that the audience, if semi-intelligent, gets to put together the pieces of the moral vignette rather than having it spoon-fed in typical Hollywood style.The running hair joke in this film is hilarious. Even more remarkable is the great performance by comedic Tim Blake Nelson, a relative unknown. Turturro, Goodman, Hunter and Durning are all special as well but we've come to expect excellence from that group. Some may not care for the Coen brothers style but that is most unfortunate since you would be missing out on a collection of the world's greatest non-commercial films ever made in the face of pretentious Hollywood. This one is a winner and very entertaining.",10,3,4,23 June 2003
