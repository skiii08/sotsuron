Angels & Demons," Spectacular Movie but Not as phenomenal as The Da Vinci Code
",First off do not compare the two movies because it's useless as both were extremely well written and well directed. Angels & Demons had exactly the kind of content I was hoping to see. Although The Da Vinci Code had more mystery this one had more action sequences. Mixing modern Science with ancient history was a brilliant concept. Tom Hanks needs to be applauded for such an amazing acting. He's the reason both movies did so well. I love watching religious mysteries especially in Vatican City especially when it involves the teachings of Pope. I'm not catholic or anything and yet I find it so interesting. I really hope to continue seeing such movies in future.,8,0,2,24 June 2009
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Completely Lives upto it's Expectations!!
","If you are a fan of trilogy, you shall not be disappointed. This movie completely lives up to it's expectations. Honestly I don't think 3D was necessary but still it was a great add on. They introduce a new star cast who were familiar from TV shows etc. and they also did a great job. Also don't storm out of theaters right after the credits, stay for few minutes and see a MAJOR clue. Milla Jovovich yet again surprises us with her charismatic hardcore action. I cannot imagine anyone else for the role of Alice besides her. Ali Larter didn't had a major role but she also kicked butt! And offcourse if you like Zombies, this one has more than the previous parts. The soundtracks of the movie were breath-taking. They literally gave me goosebumps! I'm just not happy that it wasn't long enough. I was hoping for it to be at least 120mins but it was instead 90mins but I guess they are saving it for the next chapter. And yes believe me there will be a next one! I cannot wait to own this movie in Blu-Ray.Go watch it, you will not be disappointed!!!",10,67,135,10 September 2010
28 Weeks Later," A Jaw dropping and Applaudable Sequel!
","Usually they Ruin the sequel for every movie, and especially when it comes to zombie flicks, directors and producers have tried a millions of times to re-make a classic but all have failed miserably except for Dawn of the Dead (2004). When I saw the first part '28 days Later' I was really impressed, but when I heard that a sequel is coming up I got really disappointed as I had lost hope on sequels, but just 10 minutes into watching it I got hooked even more then the first one. Concept was brilliant, cast was great, direction was applaudable. The first part didn't focus much on the spread of the virus, it was more about the survivors instead of the zombies and kind of lost it's charisma towards the end, but this part both were balanced which is why we got to see so much more of the 'rage' and the ending was much better. So far I have heard rumors of another sequel called '28 months later' and I really have high hopes for it. Being a very critical zombie movies fan I'll say this movie is amongst my top 3 favorite flicks of the dead.",10,4,7,19 January 2009
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," This is how the Summer should end!
","Okay I've never been a fan of any previous Planet of the Apes. So going into this I wasn't expecting much, but it totally blew my socks away! The graphics are so amazing and extremely realistic. The plot was very strong and very entertaining. Offcourse you must have an open mind and enjoy watching Sci-Fi movies in order to enjoy it the most. James Franco just keeps on amazing me in every movie after Spider man. I even liked him in Your Highness in which the entire cast was just goofing off.Rise of the Planet of the Apes is the perfect movie to say goodbye to summer. Amazing Graphics, Excellent plot, Brilliant Cast, and most of all Brilliant visionary Director.",9,9,19,4 August 2011
The Lion King," Actually came back home afterwards and Re-Watched the Original
","Okay after reading all the negative reviews I really wanted to like this re-make and went in with full open mind but it definitely fell short BIGGGG time. I am a fan of Jon Favreau but sadly I think he got too caught up in the CGI of this and totally overlooked the voice-overs.Besides Seth Rogan as Pumba, I think they butchered every character development. I actually came back home after watching it in theaters and re-watched the original and it's by faaaar waaay more superior. Every voice over actor nailed it, humor was top notch and it had the emotion which I did not get from the new one unfortunately.Personally I feel if you were going to keep everything the same, then the voice acting should've surpass the original OR don't bother. Unless you want to make a complete new Lion King witch new characters and storyline leaving the original untouched.",3,28,44,22 July 2019
Evil Dead," This is how you Reebot a classic with Low Budget
","First of all if you are fan of the original one, then you would know that the Evil Dead's tradition is always been to make a really scary movie with a low budget. And yes they followed the same tradition with this one, but it is impossible to say that this movie was on a budget because it purely just DELIVERED!!! I wouldn't call this to be a reboot/remake, this was more like a really good sequel and filled in a lot of holes left in the original one. Although the story had some similarities with the original, but a lot of new stuff.I'll be honest I was really nervous that they wouldn't live upto it and by the end I was really happy to say they really lived upto it. I really felt the lady actresses did an awesome job, guys could've done little better but trust me that's the least of your worries once you enter the Evil Dead World. The mood of the film was perfect,it basically complimented the original one in every aspect.Bruce Campbell, you should take a bow. He started this cult with Sam Raimi and produced this new Evil Dead with all respects to the classic. He made sure the audiences would cringe every time. And the best way to know this is when you see weak hearted people getting up and leaving during the gore scenes.So let this be a caution for you. This is not just your average horror movie. It's on a whole new league of horror and you must have a strong mindset to watch everything.Overall I am sooooo happy that after 32 years later, this movie remains alive. I really hope they go through with the trilogy again like last time.",9,90,236,2 April 2013
Avatar," Why so much Hype? Nothing too Special except for good visual effects!!!
","Went to go see Avatar today in 3D. Honestly it is definitely being overrated because I felt it had great potential but it lacked in the storyline too much. And it was extensively long. I am a huuuge Sci-Fi fan, and by far the movies like Pandorum, with Denis Quaid, and District 9 were the best Sci-Fi movies of this year, Not Avatar. Although the visual effects of the Pandorum wasn't the best but it had a really strong storyline. But District 9 had a excellent storyline and a great visual effects. Avatar on the other hand had good visual effects but not impressive storyline at all. Basically it was cartoon 3D made creatures mixed with humans. The only thing is that the director used a lot of Lumna filter in the whole movie, which made everything glow too much.If you closely watch District 9, you will clearly realize the magnificent details of the Aliens. It felt so real watching District 9. But Avatar seemed really fake. My friend just bought the PS3 game of Avatar, and trust me it looks exactly the same as movie effects. So my point is, its basically has graphics like a video game, only little more sharper.If I were you, I would save that $15 ticket, and rather wait for a better Sci-Fi movie. I have high hopes for Clash of Titans, hopefully its not as disappointing as this one was.",9,9,27,28 December 2009
X-Men: First Class," By Far the BEST X-MEN till date, Got my moneys worth for Movie Ticket and Blu-Ray
","This was by far the BEST X-MEN till date next to X-Men Origins: Wolverine. The acting was just SUPERB. I was really afraid since the cast is so young there will be lack of acting but it blew my mind away on how good they were. I did not once felt as if they're trying hard to act, it was just naturally really good.Graphics were amazing, not overly done, strong storyline. This was a complete shocker of a good time. If you're fan of the Franchise, u'll love it. And if it's ur first X-Men, than you're in it for a great ride.One of the best prequels I have ever seen.",9,0,2,4 September 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," The story was all over the place! And Yea Michael Bay u really Dropped a Ball for not including MEGAN FOX
","Okay I am a huge Transformers series fan, absolutely loved the first two. I liked this one too but the storyline was just all over the place. The movie seemed all rushed and same stuff over and over again. In fact at some scenes it looked like the movie 'SKYLINE'.So let's start, in the second movie Sam Witwicky was tired of all this chaos and wanted a normal teenage life, and in this one his character was just looking for trouble (MAKES NO SENSE). Now let's start with not including Megan Fox: Michael Bay really dropped a ball for not including her in this one, yes we all know she's very pissy and has a nasty attitude, but dammit she was perfect for these series. For God sakes settle your differences and REPRISE her character back if there will be a next one. This newbie was horrible and they both look horrible together, they had no chemistry nor any past like Sam and Mikaela did.Leo Spitz was such a lovable character in the second one, why the hell wasn't he in this one? He had and awesome comedy timing with agent Simmons. Also sam's parents role was so short. There's a reason why reviewers are saying this movie was 'missing the heart and soul'.Transformers is loosing it's originality, same stuff over and over again 'end of the world' blah blah. I really thought this movie was gonna be about Deceptions planning to destroy our Moon which would eventually destroy our world, and humans and Autobots would try everything to save it, that storyline would've been interesting to watch but the title 'Dark of the Moon' made no damn sense? Common Michael Bay give us something new and interesting to watch! Yes we know machines can transform, yes we know there are two sides, yes we know other side wants to destroy the world, yes they have failed in 2 movies already, was another 3rd movie necessary on the same subject? Graphics as usual was great which is y I am giving the rating 6 out of 10. Some new characters were great like John Malkovich, Alan Tudyk, and Ken Jeong. But you have to to realize if Shia LaBeouf is heart of this series, Megan Fox was the Soul. Therefore this movie was just half as good as the others!",4,2,6,3 July 2011
