The Lobster," Total turkey!
","The worst film I have ever seen. I like wierd, I like dark but this was neither despite what it tried or pretended to be. I will forever wonder how such an all start cast became embroiled in such an awful film. The dialogue was awful. The narration by Rachel Weiss so annoying. The lowest score I can give it is a 1 but if I could I'd give it a minus. Dont even give it a chance out of curiosity, it will just leave you feeling very angry if you waste your time watching this hogwash!",1,1,2,23 May 2020
