The Lobster," I wanted to love this but it felt a bit bland.
","I love the premise of this movie, a black comic look at how the modern world has made us all terribly lonely. Fearful that we end up unmarried and childless (let alone what other people would think!) we would be reduced back to a more primitive form. It's like natural selection meets tinder. You can't knock the performances of this fantastic cast either. Lots of internal characterisations which just emulated from Colin Farrell's facial expressions and made you feel truly awkward with him. He felt utterly tortured. But overall, it was just a bit dull and I got a bit bored. Maybe it went a step to far with it's satire and I got distracted. Would have made a good 'Black Mirror' episode but there was something missing from this as a feature length film. Which is a real shame because with a bit more backstory that the viewer could relate to I think it could have been a standout indie classic.",3,1,1,2 February 2017
