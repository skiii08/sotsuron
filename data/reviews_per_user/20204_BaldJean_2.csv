The Blair Witch Project," Really scary
","This is one of the very few movies that made me keep sitting for a while when it was over, while all around me people moved out of the cinema. I just couldn't follow them. I am very old fashioned when it comes to the way I want my horror served. No thanks, I don't want any splatter orgies; I want the horror to be slow and creeping, and I want it to be in the mind. It is not for nothing that movies like 'Don't Look Now!' or 'Rosemaries Baby' are among my very favorite ones of the genrè. I think the plot is constructed very well, and the rising angst and confusion of the three people appears to be genuine. Their situation somehow reminds me of Sartrè's play 'Huis-Clos' ('No Exit'), which contains the famos line 'L'enfer, c'est les autres' ('Hell, that's the other people'). Like the three people in Sartrè's play these three characters provide hell for themselves. Some people complain about the 'amateurish shot' of the movie. They don't seem to have got the idea that the movie is supposed to look like a documentary, so what do you you expect? Why should three people with no more technical equipment than 2 hand held video cameras be able to make anything more than that? Any more 'perfect' shooting of the movie would have ruined it completely. The movie is not quite up to the classics I mentioned, but I give it solid 8 stars.",8,0,1,17 February 2007
The Silence of the Lambs," Nothing special at all
","Very overrated movie, in my opinion. Not really bad, but nothing special either. I really don't understand what all the fuss is about. The story is only so-so, with a few logical holes. For example, why should one serial killer be able to understand another serial killer better? It really makes no sense to me. The acting is good, but nothing special either. I believe it is only so very popular because it broke one of the last taboos (cannibalism) in a mainstream movie. But that is not enough for a good movie. I admit I am a bit old fashioned about movies; for some things it is better if they are not shown but only hinted at. This sets the imagination of the viewer into work. Unfortunately many people have lost the grasp for these subtleties.",5,7,16,31 July 2007
