It," just see IT
","this movie is insanely good. the scariest movie I have ever seen. It is well written, well acted, the kids in this movie do such a good job. finn wolfhard is the scene stealer and bill skarsgard performance as pennywise is just amazing, I personally would call it Oscar worthy, I was blown away, the movie as a whole in y opinion is Oscar worthy. this is a horror film that aomehow also felt like a coming of age story, you will love these kids, you will laugh at parts, you will be scared sh*tless at others. words cannot describe how good IT is. people tend to complain about horror movie jump scares but each one of them is so good. after this movie you will be sleeping with a nightlight.",10,1,1,3 October 2017
