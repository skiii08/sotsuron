Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Bob Hoskins has a collection of classic films, and this one is by no means an exception!
","I just can't believe it, another classic Bob Hoskins film!  And it's certainly unique!  Okay, so the story here is that a rabbit (Roger) has been framed for murdering Mr. Marvin Acme and R.K. Maroon and Eddie Valiant (none other than Bob, of course) is sent to investigate.  The catch is that Eddie's brother was murdered by a toon years ago, and he can't trust Roger. After discovering the will that Acme has supposedly never wrote, he wraps up the case of the real murder crime and has Toontown bequeathed to the toons. The film mixes cartoon with real life actors (how do they do it?), and this gives it a nice touch.  The storyline is quite good, and the overall film is exciting as well as enjoyable.  I was just about a year old when this film was released, and I have been watching it since I was five years old, and I still watch it today (after all, my favourite actor is in it).  I rate this film an unbeatable 10 out of 10, a pure classic, just as enjoyable for adults as it is for kids!",Null,2,2,24 June 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The force is back, with a vengeance!
","Man, this film blasted me off my feet!  And to think Episode I was eagerly awaited but this film was sold out all over the country for weeks!  So Ewan McGregor is back as Anakin Skywalker and with Obi-Wan Kenobi they set out to find out about some sort of cloning process going on on another planet. After Anakin's mother dies in his arms he is hell bent on gaining revenge and this is where it really kicks in!  The fight near the end is excellent, and especially the funny quotes Obi-Wan makes are unforgettable!  Anakin has his arm chopped off by a light saber and he marries the princess, and later they give birth to Luke Skywalker.  Although this film is called ATTACK OF THE CLONES, the clones only attack during the last 15 minutes of the film, so Episode III is really about the war (boy, I can't wait till that comes out!).  This film has some really advanced technology and buildings and computers (it must have cost a bomb to pay for it all!), and it is really interesting, your attention will never leave the screen once you get first glimpse.  10 out of 10.  Episode II or Spider-Man?  Episode II all the way!!",Null,0,0,24 June 2002
