Skyfall," Another Fail
","I went with an open mind. I went with the idea that if it was at least as good as Casino Royale I would be happy. It wasn't and I'm not. I gauge the latest Bond film by Casino Royale or The Bourne Identity. If it is not as good as either of those...its not good. The film only started getting good when we are treated to the DB5. The film, in my humble opinion is overly long, without a decent script, humour (up until the DB5) and a great 'baddy' wasted. Why can they not get it right. They did for Royale but this movie was only marginally better than Quantumn? I had a novel end for the movie which when I mentioned to friends thought was better than the final draft.Sorry, I have all the Bond films upto Royale. I now give up and will not be attending the cinema for the next. Let down...again.",3,22,45,7 November 2012
Interstellar," Woeful
","Yet another hugely costly below average movie. Just three things I can remember about it. Self indulgent rubbish. Time may slow down approaching the speed of light. It definitely slows down watching this grandios turkey. There must be more original, exciting stories out there that could be made for a fraction of the cost. Can someone please make the book 'Deathworld' by Harry Harrison into one please. Read it and you'll see. Perfect vehicle for 'Arnie' and Cooper. Sad that the movie industry has more money to work with than the actual scientists working these problems out? From this movie they deduced more information though so that is the only redeeming thing I can think of to come from this rubbish.",2,10,19,17 December 2014
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Worth the Effort, but I wouldn't buy it.
",Almost the same length as the first film but just seemed to drag. After awhile even the robots transforming gets tiresome. Too much American Smaltz as well. Looks like the bastardising of three film franchises. Terminator meets Indiana Jones meets Transformers. Not to give anything away but I went to the cinema to see the big machines on the big screen and would advise anyone to do the same but I wouldn't buy it. Is it me or is the picture at home now on your PS3 just much better than at the cinema? Lose most of the love story and bring back the snappy dialogue from the first film. Do not go and see if you are into ancient monuments in Egypt as you will freak!,5,5,17,19 June 2009
Prometheus," Rubbish
","Booooorrrrrinnnnggg! Just been to see it and my advice is don't bother. First 30mins, your thinking, hey this could have the legs! Then appears a little teaser of several stories that could lead somewhere that just fizzle out into nothing. The only thing I can compare it to is a long journey in a car with no destination. You will not care who lives or dies, you will not know what is going on and where this is leading you to. Its like a bad sat nav journey. Save yourself the money yet again and just stay in and watch the first movie for the chills, the second for the action and if you have a brain in your head, the third for its feeling. When will the studions plough some money into something original and worthwhile instead of whipping yet another franchise horse to death. This franchise died along while ago and this film makes you think they are whipping its long dead corpse...hopefully for the last time.",3,18,46,1 June 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," booorrrrriiiing
","Too long. If you cannot tell the story in under two hours and make it interesting, its not worth telling. I had no real empathy for any of the characters, including 'Batman.' I think Levitt could have made quite a good 'Joker', if brought back, never a 'Robin' though. Anne Hathaway, passable but not as engaging as say,Moretz from 'Kick-Ass?'Hardy was quite good as 'Bane' but not a patch on Ledger. His Sean Connery speaking through a blender was most amusing. I think Caine was wasted, and his crying old man act, we only need to see this once per film Michael.The film has become almost a blur in my memory and at an estimated $25000000 dollars, that really shouldn't be the case.",5,7,18,20 July 2012
