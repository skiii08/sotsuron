Source Code," Beautifully Exceeds Expectations
","I walked in the theater expecting another Vantage Point...with just boring repetitions of the same crime scene, but the movie is fulfilling in so many other themes as well as having much more involvement that it was a pleasant surprise to go see it.Okay...I will admit, that the first 3 scenes or so are really...average. EXACTLY what you expect, even the explosion is done in a quick/rushed nondramatic and unconvincing manner. But one thing I enjoyed was that just about each time when Gyllenhaal's character gets sent back into the train via the Source Code, how1)There's a different objective 2) There a subtle changes to pay attention to 3) Achieving that objective often plays out awkwardly and comically. Going back into the train felt like an I-Spy game or even like Goosebumps books where you choose different endings. This part of the movie feels really free and loose, and Gyllenhaal really takes advantage that he knows he can do just about ANYTHING in this reality, though knows he has a goal to pursue--which may be more challenging than it seems.More predicaments, twists, character involvement and additional plots occur, too many of them do, so they're not all predictable. Also, this movie was truly emotional towards the end. It delves into what it means to live life to the fullest and to experience happiness.What I must admit also though...is that the ending took off the 'perfect 10' star for me. A forceful moment in the storyline near the end was so perfect that you'll wish that was the ending, but instead, the story continues for an extra 5-10 minutes, in a fashion that provokes questions and confusion, and the real ending is definitely not as satisfying.BUT...the movie was still largely a great, and surprisingly entertaining ride, and a nice runtime too. The end WILL suit you better if you don't sit down and analyze it too hard. My theater, roommate and I all had fun.",9,0,1,9 April 2011
Iron Man 3," The Mood and New Direction of Iron Man 3
","First off, I'm going to clarify that I don't identify with the comic books, so I'm not an avid/biased fan apart from what I've seen with the previous Iron Man movies--so my entire review will be based on that, the first two movies and what most other critics here DIDN'T address. Overall, I did get enjoyment out of this film...but not as much as I should have. What I DIDN'T enjoy: Thanks to director Jon Favreau, first 2 installments of Iron Man had an optimistic/vibrant mood and soundtrack you can cheer with (ex. AC/DC), complemented with unique and exotic locations, on top of charming and well-placed humor.Thanks to the new director Shane Black, the mood of this movie almost takes a 180, is dark and heavy a large portion of the movie, which does not transition well into the humor. Which the humor is shallow, overabundant, and placed at the wrong times. Following that, the locations are mostly bland and uninteresting (ex. small-town Tennessee). Even when you see Tony Stark's amazing mansion, it doesn't look as beautifully lit and set as you remember. Even the editing of some scenes (ex. Mandarin's broadcasts) don't fit in smoothly, they just abruptly appear, and the enhanced realism, and politics in this movie feel out of place.*Mild Spoilers* Nobody even mentioned the horror sub-genre in this movie (thanks to the inclusion of AIM and the unstable Extremis drug). It's bearable and even thrilling, but it's unexpected, way more violent and imitates movies like Ghost Rider or Resident Evil. And some themes of the movie don't even capitalize, from Mandarin's whole character to the fact that it's supposed to be Christmas in this movie but you barely feel it apart from the occasional Christmas Carols.Sigh...but apart from that here's what I DID enjoy: All the actors deliver, putting great amount of effort into their character's personality as always, and you get to see Rhodes and Pepper more involved and convincing than ever. The lengthy Action Sequences are impressive and memorable, and will have you on the edge of your seat. The movie features a lot of twists which will throw you off, which can be viewed as groundbreaking, new territory for the franchise. One of which includes Tony being reckoned to deal with his enemies by fighting without his suit. Plus, the movie makes some real thoughtful messages upon reaching the conclusion.Standalone, I moderately would've liked it with no further questions asked. But comparing it to the first two Iron Man movies, it feels like a letdown in a way. If you see it, adjust your expectations as far as the mood and direction go.",6,0,1,5 May 2013
Unknown," More Suspense Element than Taken
","Okay, we all know we can compare this to Taken. Same actor: Liam Neeson. Near the same location: Eastern Europe. Similar plot as far as rescuing/redeeming a person/persona. Yet, there are enough differences in this movie to make the experience stand out from Taken. First off, Taken is more of a 'go-get-em action/thriller', and during that experience you were confident in Liam's ability to pummel through every obstacle that got in his way. Unknown is more of a dark suspense. It has good action, but it is scattered and mostly contains mystery, questionable phenomena, and thought-provoking circumstances as your entertainment.Here I (and probably other viewers) felt less certain about Liam's capabilities mainly because he is playing DEFENSE instead of OFFENSE, plus with the aid of the identity context itself. Liam certainly doesn't feel invincible here. There are many tense, close-call type situations that don't necessarily involve fighting and jumping onto a boat.Also, the plot of Taken is almost as straightforward as it could get, finding his daughter through one witness, one trafficker one locale at a time. Don't get me wrong, Taken was fun, but as soon as Unknown really settles in, it feels as if there are three or so antagonists/enemies at the same time and therefore provokes many more questions that you want answered. I have to give credit to the use of multiple characters who were quite unpredictable, by the end when you look back to the beginning and see all that's transpired you feel like NONE of the characters were who they used to be. Last note, the photography was satisfying. Throughout the film it has a dreary/overcast/stormy type of feel that emphasizes the tension and downward motion of Liam Neeson's feelings towards his sanity. With respect to Taken, overall it's a chilling, twisty, and enjoyable experience.",8,7,16,19 February 2011
Limitless," Clever Fun...but Inconsistent
","This movie with its premise sure does attract a lot of curiosity: What could happen if you take a pill that can: speed up your mind, and drastically increase your intelligence, therefore getting you a professional job with money and influence? Therefore, this movie definitely gets you to think. Some 'What would you do' situations occur, and knowledge that Cooper's character goes into risky territory is really invigorating.Well, the movie took its premise in many different directions, unevenly jumping genres (from drama to suspense to drama to action to drama) and implicating multiple characters and conflicts into the screenplay, which in a way backfires. Yes, this means you will need to pay close attention to everything going on while crucial explanations can be very rushed (especially towards the end). The overall storyline seems overlong (felt like 2 hours 15 minutes), very choppy and inconsistent.Every time when conflicts are introduced they earn a nice scene or two, and are practically dropped, not sticking to the overall storyline. Examples including Eddie Morro (Cooper's) brain 'skipping moments' and forgetting recent events, discovering the harsh and lethal side effects of abstaining from the pill, killers trying to track the users of the pill, etc. They all seem very temporary, while between these conflicts, the previous suspense is drowned out with talk: a good chunk of it sophisticated business-style conversation and generally maneuvering around the workplace. The movie does have its pros without a doubt though.Acting and Character development. Cooper's character has a strong dynamic change is very amusing to watch, seeing him go from a fatigued, on-the-brink author, not too much emotion in his life, to a happy confident smart-talking genius. De Niro made quite a firm/rigid impression as well. As you can imagine now that Cooper accesses 100% of his brain, the script is technical and poetic.The camera-work/editing/director of photography department is certainly a unique add...some may like it some may not. In a way makes it feel like you are on drugs, featuring intense tunnel zoom effects, view distortions, surrealism with nearby objects, and changing the color from a dull dingy shade before the pill to a lively burst of color afterward. Though the dingy side of the editing is viewed far more often and can be somewhat depressing/boring to look at.Some of the action--when there is action--is creative. I would have wanted to see more dazzling locations and paradise though.Overall, the movie was a good effort, had some smart scenes and performances, and the storyline is good at first, but it totally divides apart and wasn't as consistently entertaining as it should have been--unless you are okay with talk.6/10",6,8,14,18 March 2011
In Time," In Time, it Delivers
","What you will be handed is: A fresh spin on a dystopian-bound future featuring the concept of time--literally prolonging the expiration date of your life--replacing the value of money.A good serving of drama; they don't just go all adrenaline on this concept. They focus on the reality of human struggle how there's almost no hope for the future if you're living on the edge of paycheck to paycheck. Or, on the other hand...what does life feel like when you're earning and freely enjoying all the coveted time and wealth in the world that the whole world is suffering over? Some moments in this movie will punch you cold-blooded and it hurts.Great life-or-death situations. Since the clock is always ticking in this movie, the suspense never dies when someone's life is on the line and the suspense has been some of the most unnervingly close calls I have seen in a while. The accompanying action is decent, but nothing too impressive or never-before-seen.Okay acting. Cillian Murphy and Vincent Kartheiser really had the best performances, the two leads were just okay, yet fell flat on an often basis.A plot that can be steadier. The pacing works well, though the tone doesn't maintain it's level all the way through, it does in the beginning, but not the middle and end. Some humor is thrown in but it doesn't work well. Some scenes try to have that fun, pump-up-the-music bad-boy action style and that has no flow or belonging either.A guarantee that you will do some of the thinking and drawing some of your own conclusions. Some motives/outcomes feel under-explained though. But most importantly, the writers didn't go through the hassle of explaining how the clock and all the complimentary commodities work with your body, but I commend them for skipping out on it. Don't worry about the past calculations, worry about the present effect. Go in preparing to accept a challenging concept, this is one for the thinkers.Overall, this was a pretty solid sci-fi movie. If you enjoyed Surrogates with Willis, you will most likely enjoy In Time.",8,5,13,28 October 2011
Taken 2," Solid Sequel
","When I heard there was going to be a Taken 2, I must admit, I didn't have a positive reaction. It just seemed completely unnecessary given the plot of Taken, and its near ideal ending, I just didn't want to see the whole thing rehashed all over again in a sloppy way.However, I went to see Taken 2 and I had a pleasant experience. They took the storyline and characters into full consideration. In the original Taken, the girl, Kim, seemed like a brat and all you saw her do was laugh, smile and run when she got her way and cry when things go wrong. Lenore seemed cold and proud of herself as well, only to be humbled when Bryan (Liam Neeson) proved her right of the dangers of international travel. In Taken 2, both characters are more mature, more respectful and watchable, and are more involved in the plot. Because the antagonists are after everyone, Liam and Lenore as well as Kim, it makes an interesting triangle of how everyone plays their part and help each other out.The movie is not over-coated with the action sugar with loud music and explosions everywhere. It has a great deal of thought, suspense, and a share of original technique and even dialogue, just like the original. Istanbul provides some good locations, both intriguing scenery and gloomy scenery which can also help in taking the movie seriously.Sure, it has it's flaws, and the camera-work is sometimes choppy, but the point is, if you thoroughly enjoyed the first Taken, you should see this one too.",8,74,141,6 October 2012
