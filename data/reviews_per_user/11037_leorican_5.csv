Mission: Impossible III," MIssion Impossible: The Tom Cruise/Katie Holmes Story
","When I first heard JJ Abrams was directing I said to myself, this is going to be one badass movie. I love 'Alias' and Lost', 'Alias' being more in the same vein as M.I. Finally, this franchise is going to be kickass. Well, you cant have everything. JJ Abrams does give this flick the kick in the butt its been needing since it started back in '96'...but unfortunately the lack of plot keeps it from being anything more than a loud, crash bang, Tom running around like a lunatic, plane exploding entry( take some advil or tylenol before seeing this) I left with a headache. The plot is simple; Big bad guy has this thing called the 'Rabitts Foot' that everyone wants and Ethan Hunt is called in to get it and the bad guy and bring them all in. Thats it in a nutshell and aside from one little twist at the end, thats the plot in a nutshell. When the movie begins you feel like you watching Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes having a bad day at their Scientology Church...then we are shown how it all began....and again, I felt like I was watching the Tom Crusie/Katie Holmes story. The actress eeriely resembles Katie. Look for the scene where Tom and Michelle actually look as if they are competing to see who can keep their eyes from blinking and make themselves cry during a dramatic scene.(you'll know what I'm talking about) What bothers me most about these movies is that, unlike the original TV series, these films cater more to Tom's character than the group as a whole. M.I. was always about the interaction of all agents called in on a mission. Where the women are as able as the men. These movies are all basically about 'Ethan Hunt'...One scene that bugged me was a chase scene in which the female IMF agent, played by Maggie Q, could have finally been more than just the pretty face/smart girl. She is shooting through the back window in the backseat of the car at the baddies chasing them. How they get out of this situation and what happens next should have been her key scene but they make it about 'Ethan Hunt' as if he the only one who can kick butt and get everyone out of trouble. I guess I'm spoiled from watching Sydney Bristow on 'Alias' which is what this movie basically is. If you look closely you can see the Alias counterparts all over this movie even down to the quirky computer guy played very well by the guy from 'Shaun of the Dead'. The one true badass chick in this flick is played by Kerri Russell, in a cameo performance, showing she is prime for action movies. She looks great and handles herself toe to toe with Ethan Hunt. To bad the part is minor. Her character and this whole scene is what the flick should have been like with all the agents. But alas, as I said you cant have everything. An honorable mention to Phillip Seymour Hoffman who played his part very well and was a great choice for the 'Baddie'..And Laurence Fishburn..who plays his part to the hilt and has the best lines in the movie..Now heres a real kick in the pants..for anyone who cares on having closure...You wont get it. What everyone just got killed over or almost killed for is never elaborated on or explained at the end..I guess we would have to be killed if they told us...this movie will self destruct in five seconds....please.",5,6,11,7 May 2006
Dawn of the Dead," The Dawn is here...And Zack Snyder has brought it!!!!!!
","One of the best remakes in memory. Zack Snyder's directorial debut is a fast, high tension, full speed ahead action Zombie Flick that holds no apologies. He has made this film, originally done by George Romero, his own. I remember sitting in the theater not knowing what to expect but from the minute I saw the first frames I knew I was in for a ride. Slick and perfect, zooming in from an X-Ray of a skull, the story opens and builds up creepily as the character of Anna, ( played by the perfectly cast Sarah Polley)who is a nurse, is getting off her shift at the hospital. We are given clues that something is not right with the world today and the scenes that occur as Anna leaves the hospital and then arrives home are foreshadows of what's to come and gave me the chills. The following scenes depicting Anna and her boyfriend's next day 'morning visitor' is one of the most eerie and frightening moments in the eye popping opening as all hell is about to break loose. After watching the opening credits and music, which set the mood for the rest of the film, I know I was going to have a blast. What follows is a survival test for a group of people who now find themselves thrown together in a shopping mall as they fight off the crazed zombies outside and try and figure out how to stay alive. This is in my opinion, way better than the original although that was a classic in its day. Snyder has raised the bar for Zombie flicks that all directors of this genre should adhere to. These fast moving undead are far more scarier than slow moving stiffs we usually see in this types of films. Great adaption of the original script and scenery you can chew on like the undead eating up some fresh meat. The ending credit scenes....make sure you stay in your seat till the lights come on.....are an added devilish treat...Did I say I love this movie? Filmmakers take note....This is how a remake is done!",10,1,2,24 June 2005
Dreamgirls," A true Dreamgirl come true
","I wish I had seen this on the big screen as im sure it would have been an amazing feeling to be in awe along with everyone else in the theater of the Divine Jennifer Hudson. The story about an all girl group that start off as backup singers and then come into their own only to succumb to jealousies and betrayal which finally leads to one of them being kicked out is the platform for the sensational rise and explosion of a star being born. Hudson's first rate performance proved America booted her off American Idol to fast and Simon Cowl does't know diddly. The movie itself did not fulfill me as I felt key important elements were not dealt with like showing how the friendship began for the girls and more insight to the relationship of Effie and her brother as well which would have given the act of betrayal from the people in Effie's life more punch. Although the scenes where Effie's forced to step out from the front of the group and then where they push her out completely are haunting as they seem to be almost similar with the only difference being in on scene they are expressing their love for Effie and the next their kicking her out in the streets. Beyonce does an amazing job of channeling Diana Ross while on stage performing and she deserved more props than she got for the role. Another overlooked great performance is that of Anika Noni Rose as lorell who stood her own among the rest of the cast. Jamie Foxx gave an understated performance which I found believable. Eddie Murphy also gave a great performance whose impact and appreciation may have been lost due to Eddie's past comedic roles where he basically did the same kind of voice and facial expressions he used here for the Character of Jimmy. I felt this was a strong performance by Eddie especially the scenes where he didn't say a word and his face said it all. It would have been nice to see him win the Academy Award. But there is no denying that Jennifer Hudon overshadows all these Hollywood heavies in this movie with her knockout performance as Effie White. She owns every scene she is in. The part given more meaning for those of us who saw her through the 'Idol' drama where she was accused of not having the 'Depth' to compete. Well, after I first heard her sing on Idol I too believed she did not belong there....She belonged in a higher place....her voice was a force of nature. Her talent was bigger than IDOL. Finally the dream has come true for this dreamgirl!!",7,0,0,5 May 2007
War of the Worlds," Hold on to your seats!!!! They're here!!!
","Have you ever had a nightmare where you are being chased by something almost unseen. Where, no matter how fast you run, or where you try to hide, it is there close at your heels, inches from grabbing you....This is what Steven Spielberg's 'War of the Worlds' was like, in a good scary way. I went to see this movie with some doubts after reading several reviews and of course hearing about Cruise's recent war of words with several people including, Brooke Shields and Matt Laurer. I'm glad I didn't let any of that deter me from seeing it. The story of a father coming to terms with his own selfish issues and realization that he doesn't really know his own children very well, all happening in the middle of this horrifying invasion, works well here and although its not an original idea, it doesn't matter cause it works. The grittiness of the film, special effects, camera angles as we see the the monstrous invaders rampage through the city, expert directing by Spielberg and excellent performances by everyone on hand, made this a welcomed good time. Spielberg is without a doubt one of the master directors of our time right along side Hitchcock. Although I admit that there are some unintentional moments of humor, the ending may be somewhat sappy and this may go down in history as the film where Tom Cruise was a human depository ( you'll have to see the movie to understand) all that being said, in my opinion, 'War of the Worlds', Spielberg and Cruise ROCKED!!!!!!",8,3,7,1 July 2005
Fantastic Four," Flame On!!!
","I have to say I enjoyed watching this movie even though it was not the action packed, special effects laden, vehicle I thought it would be. The special effects that are present are good if not plenty. The story deals with how these four people ( actually Five if you count Dr. Doom) all come to terms with their new found powers and how they try to cope with the notoriety of it all as well. Be Grimm's struggle is dealt with in a little more detail than the others. The writing is fun and light and doesn't take itself too seriously. The Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm's scenes are some of the best. The best action sequence, which occurs on a bridge with all four characters involved, also is done all in fun. The actors, I felt, are all perfectly cast and I have to say Jessica Alba is one of the most beautiful women I have ever scene and she looks 'Fantastic' on the big screen. Saying all this its not to say that the movie doesn't have some flaws. The biggest one for me is why the government, FBI, etc... never show up to question, study, etc....these now mutated folks. This could have been a more interesting tale. In final, To me it was like getting to watch a real good TV movie on the big screen because it was written almost as such. And thats not saying its such a bad thing. Again, I enjoyed myself. Viewers can just accept this as a fun introduction to the foursome and should expect the sequel to really deliver the goods as far as special effects and action are concerned....Now lets just hope they do a sequel...with the opening being tallied around 56 million...I think its safe to say a sequel is not far behind. FLAME ON!!!!!!!!!!!",7,3,7,11 July 2005
