The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Loved the book and loved the movie
","I loved the book, I read it almost two years ago now and I think that is generally a good amount of time to leave between reading a book and watching the movie. It is a wonderful movie, in every way. As it has been a while since I read it I wasn't annoyed by the details or story lines the filmmakers have left out. Although, I don't think it would have bothered me even if I had finished the book two weeks ago. The script is great, flows naturally, it is shot beautifully, the soundtrack is perfect, the acting is good and the casting is spot on. Logan Lerman IS Charlie. The only thing that bothered me a bit was Emma Watsons acting, but hey that's probably just me and I got over it. Also the thought of what high school in the states must be like if it is in any way like it is portrayed in movies stresses me out a lot..I think I have been feeling a little lost without noticing lately but this movie helped me get back to myself. For gods sake, this is the first movie my lazy ass has bothered to write a review about! Ever! And I been on IMDb for at least a decade! It's not my favourite movie in the world (I have a tendency to love sci-fi or fantasy or anything with lots of crazy props) but its up there, among other movies close to my heart.More people should be like Charlie. Kindness is a underrated trait.",8,0,2,10 April 2015
