The Blair Witch Project," unnerving and haunting film
","Three film students visit a small rural town in Maryland in order to make a documentary about its dark history. Things begin going wrong once they are in the woods and gradually become a living nightmare that unfolds from their point of view. The Blair Witch Project is one of the most effectively creepy and scary horror movies of our time. The situations, the people and the acting all seem so real and help create this fictional legend. Because there is pretty much a complete lack of visuals (that most modern movies use as a crutch) and the audience must rely on the reactions from the cast makes this pure genius. Of course, it wouldn't have worked had the actors failed in their performances. But that was definitely not the case with this film. I have only seen it a few times, but nearly every moment sticks with me because The Blair Witch Project is such an unnerving and haunting film.",8,2,4,16 October 2013
The Evil Dead," Campy horror classic
","Five friends go to a cabin in the woods; only to unintentionally release evil demons that slowly begin to posses them. This movie was a labor of love and it truly shows. Dead is a very important movie in the horror genre since it remains to be inspiration for so many subsequent ones. I remember several people suggesting I see this movie because I am a big horror fan. When I finally saw it, I was very impressed and enjoyed it a great deal. It's very in-your-face and is loaded with dark humor. The gore is also pretty disgusting, which goes well with a campy movie like this. I think I really appreciated the movie years after first seeing it and finding out how much went into making it. They took years to film and piece it together, actors left due to scheduling issues, they filmed in poor conditions. It really was a labor of love made by a handful of horror nerds that any filmmaker should appreciate, considering most first-time feature films turn out so horrible. The Evil dead will always remain a horror classic in my book and is always fun to watch.",8,0,1,30 October 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," Outstanding breath of fresh air to the genre
","Five friends go away for a trip to a secluded cabin in the woodsÂ… and no, you haven't seen this one. 'Cabin is a love letter to all of the wonderful things in the horror genre by Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard. I really did not know what to expect with this movie, but I knew it would be worthwhile. There is this wonderful aspect in the writing where you think you know what will happen, but you get completely blindsided. While I disagree with the majority of horror fans in that there are zero good ones being made anymore, The Cabin in the Woods was an outstanding breath of fresh air to the genre. I haven't been this satisfied with a horror movie since Trick 'r Treat. The detail in this movie was epic, to put it lightly and is one of the reasons you never get bored from watching it multiple times. It was a true labor of love from people who understand the genre. Another noteworthy aspect of the movie is they used practical effects as much as possible, which is a very rare thing today. Any filmmaker will tell you that digital effects are far easier, but it's nice to see a big studio film (let alone one of horror) not use CGI as a crutch. The Cabin in the Woods is hands down a modern-day horror classic.",10,0,3,1 October 2013
