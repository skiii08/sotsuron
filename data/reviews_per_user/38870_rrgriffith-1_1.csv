Hereditary," A Masterpiece Of Horror For The Ages
","A masterpiece of undiluted horror and creepiness that joins the ranks of Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, and The Shining. It is not for everyone but if you want to see what a thoughtful director and crew can to the director's script and vision - and this is the director's first feature film - this movie will haunt you for many days ahead. What a way to start what is hoped to be a memorable career for Ari Aster. Acting from all is breathtaking. For those who respect this genre and appreciate how a movie can mess with our very deepest horrors, on the deepest emotional level, this movie is a must-see.",10,1,3,27 January 2019
