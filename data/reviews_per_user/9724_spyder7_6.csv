Requiem for a Dream," If anyone happens to read this review, I have some good advice
","I don't want to comment on the film itself a great deal.  You'll find more than enough reviews listed on the site to read.  I do, however, want to encourage everyone to see this film and judge it for yourself.  Most of the users criticizing the film in some manner seem to have a knack for grumbling about movies from time to time (just click on their username and read some of their reviews).  I can sympathize with many of the points made by harsh critics of the film, but argue that the movie doesn't match up with their personality, mood, or desires.  It has happened to me with many films.This is a great movie, it will be compared for years to come.  Obviously, much of the movie is unoriginal by comparison to all of the raving over its originality.  Movies have been made for almost a hundred years!  Almost nothing is original anymore!  Yes, all you critics, you've seen this stuff before, somewhere.  No matter what, I do recommend seeing this excellent commentary on life.",9,0,1,12 May 2002
Spider-Man," Worth seeing once (if there's anyone out there that hasn't seen it already)
","First off, I just have to say that nobody should tell you what a movie is supposed to be or meant to be. A corollary to that however, is that we all come into each movie with different expectations. Personally, I expected a huge blockbuster (which it was), while sticking to the quality I feel that Batman (1989) had. Unfortunately, I think the quality was lacking in several areas. First off, the acting was sub-par to me. My expectations, like all of you, get me into trouble here. I have always admired Dafoe's work, but he didn't seem at all comfortable in this role (and no, I really don't think I was typecasting him in my own mind). Toby was fine, but that's it. Dunst seemed to be overacting or something...I couldn't really tell. The script (dialogue) was bad period. Yeah, comic books usually are comprised of elementary dialogue but this was an insult even so. Obviously, you can't give the movie any credit for plot, twists, or cool self-referential themes since it's based on a prior work. The CGI was bad, see Attack of the Clones or LoTR for what they SHOULD have done with the computer graphics. The mood and tone throughout was decent, but Batman was better (credit Burton). The pace of the movie and the action, which is what I was so excited about, really didn't do it for me. Again, Attack of the Clones blew this movie out for pace and action. Okay, it's not fair to compare the two on that note, but I was expecting something more towards what I eventually saw in Attack of the Clones.It was worth seeing, but I won't be buying it and won't be seeing it again. Love you all!",7,0,0,1 November 2002
The Incredibles," Not impressed...at all
","Nearly every person who likes this movie mentions something about the art and CGI. Even though I'm not drastically in love with either Star Wars or LoTR, I'd much rather watch THAT kind of CGI and appreciate it rather than pretend I'm enamored by a cartoon. Granted, the graphic art was the best part of this film, but there is not much else that's even good.I enjoyed the film enough I suppose, to sit through it once that is. The story is adequate at best...anyone could write it. Yeah, there are some dispersed messages relating to life in general, but they feel preachy and forced to me. The film really never found an identity in regards to genre. Granted, this isn't always a problem, but it was here. I was confused the whole way through, waiting for a spot to laugh and trying to figure it if the drama was serious. The end effect was that it was not really ever funny and rarely had me waiting to see what developed.The voices were decent, but I felt Jason Lee was ripped off by the animation. I think he knew where to go with the voice, but it didn't pay off in the graphic rendering of the character. Some of the script really disappointed me, e.g., 'I'm not strong enough...to lose you again.' Please, spare me. Again, I didn't buy into the drama.To be fair, this is a kid's film (I'm definitely convinced this has no place among the ranks of non-kid films) and it passes nicely as one. Also, I tend to be unimpressed with most animated features, many for the same reasons as above. However, I knew this was below par when my wife, who loves so many Disney and Pixar films, looked at me at the end and just laughed (it was her second laugh in those two hours). It turns out that she was laughing about how mediocre the film was, which is quite the opposite of her reaction to most other Pixar productions.I still give it a 7 out of 10, for two reasons. First, the CGI was impressive. Second, it was a solid kid's film, which is what it was meant to be in the first place. Why everyone is raving over it though, I really cannot understand. If I actually believed (like many people are saying in reviews) that this was meant primarily for adults, I'd easily drop it to a 4 or a 5.",7,0,1,29 May 2005
The Thin Red Line," Extremely intelligent movie, must be awake to watch this one.
","No movie can convey the way war looks, feels, sounds, you get the idea.  If you want a movie that conveys the horrible sights of war, do see Saving Private Ryan.  The Thin Red Line actually penetrates life beyond the realm of war.  I like it for that reason exactly.  It ties war to some of the most intense philosophical questions while using a decent superficial plot to entertain those with elementary school mentalities.  It does not lack humor, although much of it may only be funny if you see where the writer is coming from.  I noticed many people gave this one a '1' for a rating.  Trust me, the average IQ of those people mirrors that rating.  Overall, a superb film.",9,0,0,9 November 1999
Gladiator," You have to see it.
","The best estimate I can get is that about 2% of people disliked this movie for some stupid reason.  As you can see by the barrage of praises, Gladiator is a superb movie, I think it has a very legitimate shot at Picture of the Year.  If people can't acknowledge that, I think they are very short sighted.  I noticed that the biggest criticism received is that this movie has an very unoriginal storyline.  Well, in that case most love story movies, cop shows, natural disaster films, and science fiction films are horrible too.  Give me a break, ideas are made to be built on, this movie does a spectacular job of a Gladiator story.  Just see it, it's worth it.",10,0,0,28 November 2000
Back to the Future," Proof that Hollywood once was capable of putting magic on film
","I watched this movie again for about the seventh time after a 10 year lapse or so. If there ever was magic on screen, Back to the Future has it. By the end of the film, I was only thinking, 'Wow, Hollywood was once capable of putting magic on the screen.' It really makes you wonder if the best of Hollywood is behind us.To summarize a few components of the movie: The storyline and plot are superb, even with the minor plot holes. The acting is spot on in every scene. Today's film editors should watch this film a hundred times to see what editing should really be like, nearly flawless. The direction is unbelievable in my opinion. The screen writing and script are perfect as well and will make you laugh and smile throughout the movie. Every line by the awkward McFly family, every crazy rumbling of 'Doc', and even the cheesy bully taunts of Biff fit together so well.When I sat down to watch this movie a few days ago, I expected to see an aged movie that I remembered being much better than it actually was. I'm so glad I was wrong.",9,14,17,23 October 2005
