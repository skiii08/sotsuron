Scarface," perfect definition of a rise and fall story
","Scarface is truly a great gangster epic. In fact, this is the best gangster epic. Al Pacino certainly fits into his role.Why didn't Pacino get an Oscar? I have no idea. This film itself deserved numerous Oscars. Brilliant directing,compelling storytelling, and a great musical score by Giorgio Moroder. This film also has strong supporting acting, especially by Robert Loggia and Paul Shenar.Al Pacino brings fire to his character, as he does to many other roles. The only character that stays out of the way and used as the voice of reason is the mom, played brilliantly by Miriam Colon. Tony Montana starts out with good intentions. He has many dreams. But he lets greed overtake himself. I always enjoy morality stories, they teach good lessons. Pacino is the best actor in the world.",10,0,1,28 August 2003
Alien," The best of its kind
","Why can't they make sci/fi/ horror movies like this anymore? I am not a huge fan of scifi but this film sticks to the meaning of horror and shows it. In order to make a great movie, a good story is what counts not good effects. Great cast, they all do their job, no one overacts. Especially Sigourney Weaver and Ian Holm, they do great jobs.Also brilliant direction by Ridley Scott. When they made this movie, they did'nt have CGI effects or digital editing. So give them credit. The whole movie takes place inside a ship, so it combines claustrophobia with other issues to give more of a scary feeling. Like I said, it's the best of its kind. 10/10",10,1,3,20 June 2004
Dumb and Dumber," what's wrong in laughing?
","I have read so many reviews by critics and IMDb users getting all over this because what: it makes you laugh. Maybe this doesn't have the smartest plot, but all that matters is that you're entertained. We all knew Carrey would be good in a ''slapstick'' comedy. But the real surprise is Daniels. After being usually in dramas or some comedies, but never in ''slapstick'' comedies. Both Carrey and Daniels are hilarious. Check out those haircuts. ( Spoiler Alert! ) The only scene I don't like is the scene where Lloyd( Carrey) sells Harry's( Daniels) dead bird to a blind kid. That's not funny. Other than that, this is one of the best ''slapstick'' comedies of the 90's. Also, the best Farrelly Brothers' comedy.",9,0,2,23 December 2004
The Last Samurai," Perfect mixing of cultures
","Great movie! Tom Cruise brings depth to his role. Great directing by Zwick and a great screenplay by John Logan. Very interesting in showing ways of Japanese people and way of the Samurai. Ken Watanbe gives a strong performance of portraying the Samurai leader. Good score as always by Hans Zimmer. Good cinematography,editing, sound, art direction and costume design. As I said, the movie shows a perfect example of an American soldier( Cruise) mixing with the Japanese culture. Spoilers!!!- Cruise plays a post Civil War soldier called on to lead a Japanese squad to defeat the Samurai. As the movie goes on, Cruise gets involved with the Samurai and learns their way and finds out they're not ''savages'' like Tony Goldwyn's character says. Also the film has many impressive fight sequences.",9,1,2,19 June 2004
The Untouchables," Connery and De Niro dominate
","This is a very good movie despite a few cheesy moments. Kevin Costner is not a good actor. He is better when surrounded by powerhouse performances by actors. For example, he is better with Connery. First things first, the acting is good all-around. Connery won an Oscar and it was well-deserved. He brought fire to the movie. So did De Niro's portrayal of Al Capone. Garcia is good in his brief screen time. Patricia Clarkson isn't given much to do besides smile and look goofy.Despite that, this is a very good movie. Well-directed by DePalma and well-scripted by Mamet.8/10 for the gangster epic.",8,3,6,21 December 2004
Platoon," In a class of its own.
","This movie is not only the best war movie,it is one of the best movies of all time!! Oliver Stone tells his real-life Vietnam tour. He tells this story and relates it to anyone. Very few movies accomplish this and succeed.
The cinematography, editing and music are great. Brilliant direction by Oliver Stone. Strong ensemble acting. Tom Berenger gives the best acting performance. Charlie Sheen and Willem Dafoe deliver as well. Overall A+",10,1,2,21 August 2003
Casino," Explosive and underrated
","You can sum this movie up in one word: explosive. Excellent directing by Martin Scorsese. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci once again deliver. The voice-overs work perfectly on De Niro, while Pesci gives the most explosive performance of the film, even better than he is in Goodfellas. Sharon Stone is perfect and should have won the Oscar. Amazingly, this film is the telling of a true story, based on Nick Pilleggi's novel. Great storytelling and the supporting cast is good,too. Scorsese doesn't use score, he uses source music, just like in Goodfellas. The use of source music fits in this story as it covers the 60's to the 80's. Underrated movie, although Stone was nominated, but nobody else, give me a break. Another thing I like, none of the acting is over-dramatic, they deal with the issues as they are.",10,1,2,30 August 2003
Gangs of New York," 'The Hands that Built America'
","Great movie! Should have won Best Picture. Brilliant directing by Scorsese. He doesn't hesitate in showing violence in order to show an accurate depiction as he does in many of his other movies. Great ensemble acting, but standout is Daniel Day-Lewis. Diaz is surprisingly good too.Very entertaining,Lewis steals every scene. He becomes his character. Oscar-worthy.Great cinematography and all other aspects behind the camera.This is also a very important movie. You have to appreciate any story that deals with a part of how our country was started. U2's 'The Hands that Built America' goes perfectly with the movie. That song summarizes the movie. 10/10",8,1,2,19 June 2004
