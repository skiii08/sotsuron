Alien 3," Truth About Alien3
","At first this movie turned me off, but as I grew older I have learned to love this brilliant film.First off, the script was toned for Sigourney Weaver. As heard in the commentary of Aliens. Sigourney desired to make love to the alien, to not use weapons, and to die. All of which happened, well the first one didn't really happen (unless you accept the classic shot in which it looks like the alien is kissing Ripley).Many fans of the series, also get upset about the death of Newt. I always get annoyed with that statement, because Rebecca Jorden grew up and never acted again.Alien3 is also the most cerebral of the entire series, taking the feminist subtext to its reasonable point. To a female Christ figure. Fincher and the rest of the cast & crew did an excellent job in having religious concepts spread throughout the film. Thus making the suicide of Ripley more powerful and giving it a larger purpose.A special thanks must be given to Fox for butchering Fincher's original cut. This weakened much of the character development and it lost Golic.Thank you Fox. But I recommend watching this film with an open mind. If you do so, you will enjoy a beautiful film that is the perfect dark end to the Alien Trilogy.For me the series is done after that.",9,0,3,8 July 2006
