Sucker Punch," Fantastic One !!!
","It is one of my best ( if not the best ) I hope there will be a Sucker Punch 2 movie ..and if there won't be .. there must be a remake or at least another movie of the same kind and directing :)I think that Sucker Punch is a great idea of an epic action fantasy that takes us into the vivid imagination of a young girl whose dream world provides the ultimate escape from a there.Sucker Punch does damage and is an increased priority move. If the target does not use an increased priority move during the round that it is used, Sucker Punch will go first regardless of the user's or target's Speed.",10,7,15,22 February 2014
