The Perks of Being a Wallflower," My opinion about movie
","Firstly,i want to say i love actors in this movie.I know Emma Watson from Harry Potter movies.She was a hardworking and pretty girl in Harry Potter.But now,she is a reckless girl.Already,Ezra Miller and Logan Lerman are successful of their job.Absolutely,they're talented people.Other than this,they are together in harmony. Also,the plot is very absorbing.I think it's best one type of teenage movies.It's so dramatic for me.I cried but i was a little bit happy after watch it.We're watching to the story of a teenager boy finding himself.It's reminds me when you found yourself,you will catch the real happiness.Maybe,someone makes you feel better in high-school. So,you should watch this film and go find yourself!",8,1,2,25 October 2016
