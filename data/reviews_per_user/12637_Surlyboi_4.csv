The Blair Witch Project," The last ten minutes scared the bejeezus outta me...
","Truly, a great piece of film making. It takes a lot to scare me, I left the theater truly rattled. Yeah, there were problems with logic, (follow the stream, dammit!). And why anyone would go running into an old house in the middle of the night with 20 pounds of camera gear still boggles the mind, but all of my reservations come long after the initial experience. See this film, and never, ever go camping without a GPS tracker and a shotgun.",Null,2,3,2 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A solid film
","It would be very easy to slam 'The Phantom Menace' when comparing it to the other three films in the 'Star Wars' saga as a whole. All too easy. The problem with that reasoning is, of course, you're comparing one film to a trilogy. Is the characterization lacking? In comparison, of course it is. Is the plot lacking? Again, in comparison, the answer would have to be yes. But here's the rub, This is one film. It is the prelude to two others; and ultimately, the setup for the very trilogy to which it is being unfairly compared to. 'Menace' is a solid film, that, taken out of the context of the the Star Wars films, would stand very well on its own.Detractors of the film have said that Lucas made it for his six-year-old son. They say this film is only for children and neglects its older audience. Not true. Granted, there are definitely 'kiddie' aspects, but how many of your average first graders will understand the political intrigue and almost machiavellian maneuvers made in this film? Not a lot I'd bet.As for character development, yes, it is sparse, but it is not non-existent, and as the trilogy progresses it will get deeper. Besides, we already know a lot of what drives Obi-Wan Kenobi from the episodes IV-VI. We also see small signs and portents of what we know all too well young Anakin Skywalker will someday become.The special effects, of course, are without peer. ILM has raised the bar yet again, and left others playing catch-up. I don't care what anyone says, a lot of the effects were indistinguishable from live action.The choreography of the jedi scenes was great, the fury of this film's Sithlord is unmatched by anything that came before (or after, if you want to get technical about it).Bottom line, yes, this film may not be as good as the 'new hope' trilogy, but it certainly holds its own and should be seen, preferably twice, so you catch the nuances you may have missed the first time around.",Null,0,0,24 May 1999
Akira," Ignore the hype, just judge this for yourself.
","I saw Akira when it was initially released in Japan. I had read some of the manga when it appeared in Young Magazine, so I was aware of the basic plot points. What I saw in the theater blew me away. Sure it's got its gory moments, and yes, I do agree that some parts of it do ramble. But when you take this whole film in, from plot to characterization; from Direction and animation style to score and soundtrack, you have a combination that makes for an incredible package. It's been said by other reviewers here that this is a 'fattened', 'Americanized', 'Disneyfied' version of what Anime is in Japan. It is so far and above that. The decision not to use the big, round-eyed stereotypical anime character was actually a concsious step away from the large eyes, which originated as Tezuka Osamu's homage to the Disney style of the fifties. The animators were more interested in characters that actually looked somewhat realistic and more Japanese than the typical Anime character.As has also been said before, the story is rather deep, but the film does not do the manga justice. If you really want to appreciate the story and you've got a lot of free time, pick up the printed version. It'll shed light on a lot of the ambiguities of the plot.Lastly, as I said in my summary. See this film, and leave everything I or anyone else has said about it at the door. Experience it for yourself and judge it on your own terms.Oh, and stay away from the dubbed version.",Null,0,3,26 September 2000
The Matrix," If you don't like it, you probably didn't get it.
","I expected The Matrix to suck.I had seen the commercial during the Super Bowl, and the first thought that crossed my mind was, 'Oh god, another Keanu/poseur-cyberpunk flick. I've never been so glad to be wrong. This film was amazing.The majority of the people I have seen that disliked this film, seem not to have gotten the point of it. The Matrix bids you take a long, hard look at our perceptions of reality and the absurdities therein. If you're willing to follow it, and take that leap, then this film opens up to you. If you don't, then you'll just look at it as another example of where 'Hollywood went wrong'Most sci/fi fare of late has been like an id software game, about three minutes of story to support two hours of action and special effects, and technological wonders. Not so here. The effects do what they should do, enhance the story. The slow time and bullet tracing effects have their places and a reason to be there. The action and effects are there because they further the story, not because they ARE the story. The backstory and the world the Wachowski brothers have created here are deep enough for a million other stories with or without the principals in this one. (As evidenced by the website, if you haven't already, check it out and read the Gaiman story.)The acting is generally good, yes Keanu is blank and sort of dazed through most of it, but hell, if I could manage blank and dazed after experiencing what his character experienced, I'd be doing pretty damn good in my book. This script and the character play to his strengths. Fishburne's turn as Morpheus, the 'reality pusher' is great.Yes, the dialogue can be corny at points, so what? I have yet to find a person in real life who could snap off a witty line in any situation without one falling flat every now and then. And when was the last time a throwaway line made you scratch your head and say, 'Damn, I always wondered why everything tastes like chicken.'All-in-all this film has a whole lot going for it, its strengths far outweigh its weaknesses, anyone who didn't like it probably didn't want to like it. It may not change your world, but it will at the very least entertain you for two hours.",9,0,0,9 April 1999
