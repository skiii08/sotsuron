Blade Runner 2049," Not The Visual Masterpiece I Was Hoping For...
","I saw Blade Runner 2049 last night. I had high hopes, high hopes coupled with a little sense of concern.When I first heard that they would be making a sequel, I was apprehensive. I loved the original Blade Runner. It was flawless. It was Ridley Scott at his finest.I wasn't sure how I felt about a potential sequel. When I heard it would be a continuation of Deckards story, I was even more concerned. To me, Deckards story came to an end in the original when those elevator doors shut or that highway scene on the road, depending on what cut of the film you've seen. There was no need to elaborate further on it.So now we have Blade Runner 2049, which will probably not be the last outing for Deckard, as hints are already being dropped for a potential another one if 2049 is a commercial success. It's not looking like it will be...So when I left the cinema, I felt tired... I shouldn't feel that coming out of having just seen a sequel to one of my favorite films of all time. By god was it slow.Original Blade Runner never outstayed its welcome. The editing was fantastic, the pace felt just right. The scenes did not go on for as long as they needed to be, and the film was all the more better for it.2049 is 2 hours and 44 minutes long... The original was 1 hour and 57 minutes long. There is nothing wrong with those numbers, but if your going to have a very long film, you want to get the pacing right. The longer you go, the greater the risk that your story is going to wear thin.And sure enough, it did. 2049 has great visuals, decent enough music although I felt they didn't do as great a job on that front and overall the performances were good. The story, plot and writing was pretty bad and there is a jarring difference between this and the original. Which could have been avoided if they avoided bringing a conclusion to Deckards story. One could say it's about K's story as much as it is about Deckard. That is true in a sense, but the overall theme revolves around K's pursuit of Deckard, a theme that gets enforced not long into the film.Denis Villeneuve did a good enough job, and fair deuce for doing it. Cause trying to live up to the original can't be easy. I think with a better script, a better story they could have truly gone places. But they restricted themselves into doing this story, and that's a damn shame.And I think Blade Runner 2049 gets it all wrong as well when it comes to 'themes' of the original movie. This isn't a standalone film. It is a sequel, so comparisons have to be made to the first film. In the first film, you didn't have any major villains. Even the replicants were not 'villains' themselves, but simply survivors trying to live out their life.One could argue that Tyrell corp is the real villain, but is it? That was never the sense I got in the film - they are morally questionable, sure. But dastardly villainous? No... certainly not. That's what made Blade Runner great.Unfortunately, Jared Letho's character, Wallace, is every bit as traditional villain you can get. And that makes me sad. Hampton Fancher didn't do a great job on the script. It is definitely missing the wonderful influence of David Webb Peoples.Blade Runner is not the visual masterpiece I was hoping for. It doesn't live up to its potential, but its there. It exists.Whether or not to be grateful for it existing is up to you.",6,4,7,23 October 2017
Fury," Great WW2 Tank Focused Film With Subpar Script
","Fury is a great tank flick of a film that focuses on tank warfare, sort of focus that is quite rare. Not only that, I'm pleasantly surprised to see them use genuine Sherman and Tiger tanks (working museum models) which shows they put a lot of care in getting across the historical accuracy of how these tanks operated.With that said, can't say the same for the actual script, tactics and methods used here. My favourite scene being the Tiger battle against the Shermans, and sadly, my least favourite would have to be the ending.The ending was your typical cliche hollywood last stand as the 'heroes' of the film face off against the germans in a last ditch suicidal effort because 'reasons'. Reasons that are never really explained other than a sense of hatred for the SS, and it so happens that an SS Platoon is making their way to them.All in all, a disappointing finish with a last stand that made absolutely zero sense because of the german inability to flank and surround an immobilized tank. But hey, if it made sense, then we would probably get a very different film.And maybe just a slightly better visual experience than what we ended up getting.Regardless, Fury is a great watch up until the ending, and should be enjoyed for what it is; TANKS!",6,2,2,1 April 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Rogue One Is The Star Wars Film True Fans Wanted
","I really wanted to do this review without spoilers, but I wanted to talk about a few 'controversial' elements within the film that has sparked a flurry (some good, some bad) of feedback concerning it. But more on that later. This review contains spoilers, minor at best - I'll not spoil plot elements or the ending.Rogue One has had me worried ever since I saw Force Awakens. I was not happy with FA, not one bit. While I enjoyed the film to a degree, I found it woefully poor, extremely fast paced and it all seemed like a cheap knock-off on the original trilogy. JJ Abrams is the new 'hip director' and that's not a compliment. It's quite obvious I'm not a fan of Abrams, and I would dear hope he is no longer tied to future films (in addition to certain writers, producers).But Rogue One is a breath of fresh air and contains none of the recycled material that Force Awakens throws at us. None of the marketing shoved in your face such as the riot stormtrooper, falcon with a new dish, chewie armband toy, to name but a few. Sure, Rogue One is going to cash-in on it, but at least I watched the film and immediately didn't think the director wanted me to buy a new toy.Another thing that is a welcome change to a star wars movie - the 'force' takes a backseat on this one. Well, mostly. There are still elements concerning a character, but at least its not the main character. Instead we are treated to a film that is about the men and women of the rebel alliance. The grunts, the 'little folk' who don't have any fancy force powers, and have to rough it out like the rest of us. It was refreshing.This film felt right in every way - the pacing fell in that sweet spot. Not too fast, not too slow. Everything moved along at a steady enjoyable pace. The characters felt fleshed out, interesting and intriguing. Attachment actually grew with the characters. Where as in Force Awakens, everything was racing along at warp 10! You can sit down and actually enjoy the film, take in the plot and relax, rather than think your watching a formula one race.I honestly do not have a bad word against Rogue One. If anything, I wish it was longer. I really didn't want to leave the cinema, and I was somewhat saddened to have it end. But I will surely go and see it again.Now, I do want to briefly discuss that 'controversial' element that appeared in the film, and certainly knocked me for six! (SPOILER) Peter Cushings infamous character, Grand Moff Tarkin makes a prominent appearance in Rogue One. Not just a cameo, but he pops up several times in the film. I was not only shocked, but pleasantly surprised, and excited. I love the Tarkin character, and I honestly thought they did a great job on it. The CGI Tarkin was flawless. Some people online have been criticizing. Majority of those seem to be so-called 'Moral High-Ground Chasers' who have nothing better to do than complain all day about how the appearance of a dead man made it in the film. As if its some kind of insult to use him in a Star Wars film.I like to think of it as a continuation of the legacy and legend that is Peter Cushing, and seeing him portrayed near-flawlessly in Rogue One is a treat I did not expect. The critics don't seem to be taking an issue with the younger Leia, but that's because the actress is still alive. So it seems the criticism is mainly geared towards the fact that Cushing's appearance was used. But the Cushing family were involved in the process and aware of it. Did they take issue? No, they didn't, and they were actively involved.So quite your whining! Rogue One is an excellent star wars film, and it has more than a few surprising 'nods' to the original trilogy, but they're subtle enough that it never breaks immersion.Go see it!",9,3,9,16 December 2016
Interstellar," A Over-hyped Imperfect Movie...
","Interstellar is not a bad film. Lets get that out of the way... Nor is it a great film either.It straddles the fence of imperfection ever so well. There are some great moments and then there are some very long drawn out moments that make you shout at the screen and say, 'Shut up already and get on with it!' Once such scene came when Anne Hathaway was talking about love... a lot. Yes, there was a lot of talk about love and analyzing what love means. That moment sucked me out of the film, because I found it hard to be dragged into the immersive experience that Interstellar should be, when it is coupled up with such bad writing that doesn't blend in a scene well.Such out of context reality smashing moments happen a lot in Interstellar that makes you wonder if the writers were tripping out on their own interstellar experience. Another scene comes at the revealing of a betrayal, of sorts, from a certain character. Without going into too much, all I'll say is that the scene felt hammy, rushed and again, didn't blend in what was going on. While I 'get it', as in the reasons for the betrayal, I didn't 'get it' in terms of why it had to happen, and it just felt... strange.By the time the film matures in the middle, it goes downhill and your left on a spiraling out of control adventure that is the result of some new age writing gone bad.If that wasn't bad enough, I had to put up with the endless scenes of key dialogue that I could hardly hear, because Nolan likes to blare his music up over important dialogue. Maybe it was just the Cinema sound system being extra enthusiastic, or maybe once again, a criticism that I've aimed at Nolan before, is that he really needs to edit his movies better and get an editor that doesn't make it hard for the viewer to hear what's being said. It is blatantly criminal in the sheer bad editing that this film suffers from.The film does have its good moments, although I would have to call them rare, but again the visual effects are splendid and is possibly the only reason why this film is a 6 for me, and not a 5 or lower. There literally some scenes in the film that made me go 'wow...' and look on with delight. It's for these scenes that you need to go and watch Interstellar, but be warned, that the rest of the film performs below its expectation.Major Gripe: Time for a major gripe, and I thought it would be the editing of the film, but no. It comes down to design. Now, I've read that there are those that liked the robots, TARS, and CASE. That's fine, and I'll admit the design is unusual and somewhat funky. Yet the positive reviewers probably don't or won't, look at the faults in design. Well I saw the fault in the design all too clear; In one particular scene, just after getting out of the shuttle after landing on a new planet, TARS is scene 'walking' for want of a better word, onto the planet. Yet I caught that moment when it awkwardly tried to maintain its balance. What was it doing with its left leg? I wondered to myself... And ever since I saw that strange fault, I couldn't let it go. The more I looked at its wobbly movements and its rather awkward looking design and its very human personality with its very human non-robotic voice, I just couldn't get into it that this was a robot. I kept on imagining a guy in a suit... and that's the problem.When you design a robot for a film, you need to get it across to the audiences that this is a robot. Not some strange puppet on a string or anything else, but a robot. Sadly Nolan failed in getting this across because of the voice being used, because of the very human personality and because of the rather awkward looking way it just went about. There was nothing about the robot that I honestly liked, it just didn't feel like one, and at no time in the film is it explained where the tech came from, impressive tech at that, yet it just didn't translate well onto the screen.Interstellar is a decent film. Is it worth the prestigious rating of 9.0 that most reviewers give it? I personally don't think so, and I think in a lot of cases such positive reviews come from the reviewer being dazzled with special effects and in a lot of cases that is the case. It happened with Gravity; people were so amazed at the effects they just threw 9's at it all day. Interstellar is not about any of that, it's about the story, and sadly, it lacks a decent one.",3,16,32,9 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," What Were They Thinking!
","Good god bruce almighty, its bad! It is beyond terrible. It is a meandering mess and the script, the plot, the dialogue, is on par with the prequels. I swear to you, you could almost believe that George Lucas wrote the script for this, and that's not a good thing, but if he had, I'm sure Lucas would have done a better job at it.I would rate this 1 star, if it wasn't for the fact that Luke Skywalker actually does 'stuff' in the film. I would rate it 3 stars if Luke Skywalker did anything that his actual character would do. Unfortunately we are left with the shallow empty shell of a man who resembles nothing like the Skywalker I grew to love in the original trilogy.This film has become so disneyfied it no longer resembles the Star Wars that I love. In fact, you could almost mistake it for another film... Spaceballs ring a bell? Nothing wrong with Spaceballs. It was a comedy. You knew what you were expecting. But people don't walk into a cinema and expect slapstick unfunny comedy one after the other. No wonder JJ Abrahms wanted to direct this film after he saw the script, cause he butchered Force Awakens and this new film has received a similar finish.I never thought I would ever, in my lifetime as a star wars fan, rate any of the new Disney films below the prequels. That changes now. If you want a star wars film, go see Rogue One. Avoid this!",2,1,1,19 December 2017
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," A Worthless Flick
","Good god how is this film given a rating above 6...It is beyond terrible.Are people really this tasteless?The musical acts sound like they've been pushed through a sound synthesizer by someone who hasn't got a clue what they're doing. The original musicals were pretty good, sung with appreciation and talent. Can't say the same here.Depp's performance, as bizarre as it is, is rather woeful. Reminds me too much of a Michael Jackson imitation and that's not what you want to be thinking about watching this film.The overall plot more or less follows the original in some ways, but really there's nothing to be gained from it. It wasn't ambitious enough, although the imagery was nice and splendid, it was sadly backed up by shoddy writing and direction.",1,5,6,19 July 2018
Annihilation," A below average script with an interesting concept
","There's nothing amazing about this film.Frankly the plot is rather dull backed up by shallow writing, an unbelievable set-up and actors that don't feel 'right' in their roles.I found the flashbacks boring, pointless to the overall story and generally uninteresting, nor did I feel compelled to care about any of the cast.I liked the concept, the idea of this strange phenomenon, but really they don't end up doing anything interesting with it and it only serves as a pretty lacklustre backdrop for some unoriginal drama.",3,1,2,14 July 2018
