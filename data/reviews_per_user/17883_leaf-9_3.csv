The Ring," Reasonable Horror Film
","*May Contain Spoilers*The Ring is not an entirely scary film, but there are some scenes which are frightening. The reason I watched The Ring, was because I thought the idea of watching a video, then receiving a phone call telling you you have 'seven days' left to live was interesting. I was especially intrigued to see the explanation of how this came about. However, the supernatural explanation (which I suppose was the only way of justifying the strange events which occurred) was a little bit of a let down. The film leaves a few questions unanswered and there are also plot holes. Having said that, however, the ending is fairly unexpected. (The reason Rachel isn't killed is a bit dubious, although the final scene is rather disturbing). I am interested now however in watching the Japanese version (Ringu) on which this film is based.The single most annoying this about this film, however, is the overacting of the two girls (Amber Tamblyn & Rachael Bella) at the start. Their performances are almost laughable and detracted from the horror of the first scene. I found it incredibly difficult to take this scene seriously. Thankfully the other actors in this film are much more talented. Naomi Watts does a good job as Rachel, the protagonist.Upon reading other reviews on IMDb for this film, I was surprised at how many people commented on how the images stayed with them for a long time after watching The Ring, as I found this was not the case for me. I definitely did not feel afraid of the television set after watching this film - it was only upon reading other reviews that the idea even occurred to me.The Ring was definitely not the scariest horror film I have ever seen (that honour would have to go to The Exorcist). However it was suspenseful and entertaining, overall I would give it 7 out of 10.",Null,0,0,26 November 2002
Spider-Man," Over hyped
","I never read any of the Spider-Man comics so I can't say whether this is an accurate portrayal of the comic books but I can say that as a film, Spider-Man was only mediocre. While the acting was good, it couldn't save what was ultimately a very badly written script.*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***The scene in which MJ (Kirsten Dunst) says to Peter (Tobey Maguire) 'I love you, I love you so much' was so ridiculous that my friends and I couldn't help but laugh - this seemed to be the worst line in a script that just got worse over the course of the film. The dialogue for the romantic subplot was so badly written that it made it difficult to take the film seriously.
However this is not to say that the film didn't have some funny moments (even though a lot of the lines were funny for all the wrong reasons), and the special effects were good but I can't begin to imagine why this film broke box office records. I suppose if you enjoy action films this film is worth watching (if you can overlook the bad dialogue...)",Null,0,0,15 June 2002
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Perfection
","It's so rare these days to go to the cinema and see a truly touching film, or even an original film, since so much of the films released these days are so formulaic. As far as romances go, most films nowadays seem to follow the same pattern. So it was unbelievably refreshing to see a film like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.I wanted to watch this film as I knew it had been written by Charlie Kaufman, and I enjoyed two of his earlier films Adaptation and Being John Malkovich. The unusual combination of Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet also intrigued me. I think that when you watch a good film, every frame seems to fit exactly in place and that's what this film was like for me. There are many films that play with memory, but this does so successfully while maintaining the premise of the romantic comedy. I found it clever how Michel Gondry played with continuity editing as Joel's memories were being erased and, the ending also impressed me as it resolved the plot points successfully while leaving some things uncertain. I have a whole new respect for Jim Carrey after seeing this film. Kate Winslet was also brilliant. Hopefully the Academy will remember this film next year, as it deserves at least a nomination for Best Picture.To me this film is as wonderful as The Shawshank Redemption (my favourite film of all time) so I would give it, without hesitation, 10/10",Null,0,2,9 May 2004
