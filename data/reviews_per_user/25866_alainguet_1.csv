Blade Runner 2049," Brilliant casting, splendid images, boring film on the whole...
","Taking almost 3 hours to tell a story at such an excruciating slow pace is either sadistic or suicidal. The packaging and casting make you expect an action scifi movie...instead, you get a series of scenes, some of them magnificent, others that just make you yawn and want to press the fast forward button of an old VCR. All the female characters - Robin Wright does it again - are superb though, but have been the only reason I watched till the end, because K's identity problems are not worth spending so long in a movie theater.",3,2,4,31 December 2017
