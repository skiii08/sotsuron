Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," It's cliché to say but they have done it again!!!
","The Pirates franchise has always been a perfect blend of action, visuals, and comedy. As for the 4th installment, these three things are not only still part of the major experience but more powerful than ever.For starters, there is way too much going on in front of the camera for you to be easily distracted with a text or people entering and leaving the theater(which I highly doubt there will be much exiting). Secondly, if there is ever what seems to be a dull moment then Hans Zimmer's fantastic as usual score will zap you right back in to the movie. Finally, the scenery alone is worth the time and at least a matinée priced ticket. So, in the end Pirates does not require a long list of the good and the bad in the movie. These movies are meant for the shier pleasure of being entertained with a more than sufficient amount of eye candy and great scripts with the right touch of family/adult comedy.As for Depp, he has pleasured the screen with many great performances, but Captain Jack Sparrow will never walk the plank on the ship of his most memorable.",Null,2,4,23 May 2011
Super 8," Stand By ME.T.
","I have been a sci-fi fan since I first laid eyes on a guy in an alien suit. But, it has been a few years since the genre really felt alive to me. These days, the genre has either forgetting it's roots or tried to hard to push the limits of CGI. Super 8, is the savior I have been waiting for.Super 8 is a truly amazing experience and to say that is a blend of many 80's kids Sci-Fi films is definitely an accurate speculation. However, I feel that the strongest comparison would be E.T. meets Stand By Me. The film has many memorable parts and to spoil them would be a crime so just trust me when I say that it is worth all time and money that you will spend to see it.Finally, watch out for the train scene because it will send your hearing in to a panic. For you Universal monster fans, keep an eye out for a Creature From The Black Lagoon action figure. Lastly, stay for the credits to see the kids movie and a fun little reference to the king of zombie cinema.",7,1,4,10 June 2011
