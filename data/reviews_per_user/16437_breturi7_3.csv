Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's Star Wars, Baby!
","Okay, I'm not a Star Wars dork...really, I'm not.  I just love the movies, they're classics.  So is 'The Phantom Menace' able to live up to the previous ones?  This depends on the viewer rather than the movie itself. So far, I've seen it twice.  The first time, I thought it was okay, but not as good as any of the originals.  I went back a second time, though, and boy was I surprised.  Maybe it was because I entered with a different mindset...the first time, I let the hype get to me...the second time, I went to see it just because.  I was blown away.  The movie is amazing.  Not only do I think this lives up to the originals, but I have a feeling (maybe its the Force :-) that these prequels are going to dominate the originals. When I first saw it, I was disappointed that they didn't develop the characters...but the second time, you begin to notice the subtle nuances of each character, pick up on little tidbits of dialogue that you might of missed before, even the facial expressions work wonders to convey the sense of connectedness between the protagonists. You also notice, if you're familiar with the original movies, that the majority of the dialogue foreshadows things to come not only in 'The Phantom Menace' itself but also in the whole saga.  The only instructions I give is this: don't let the hype get to you, go in there expecting nothing, go in with a clear mind, and see it more than once!!!! See it the first time just to see it, to witness the grandness of the effects and the kick-butt light saber duel.  But see it a second time and more for the details, the development of plot/character/and the overall saga storyline.  Just like the other Star Wars movies, 'The Phantom Menace' gets much better with more viewings.  Even Jar Jar wears on ya  :-) Bottomline: This movie is GREAT!!!!  Two thumbs up, 10 out of 10 stars, a Must See again and again and again!  I can't wait to see it for a third time!",8,0,0,26 May 1999
Sleepy Hollow," Burton's a Genius
","'Sleepy Hollow' is Tim Burton's 'Sistine Chapel Ceiling.'  It is a terrific, complex, funny, film that ties in every known movie genre known to man.  This movie would have sucked BIG TIME had some other, less visionary director taken the reigns, but Mr. Burton is a truly gifted artist. I've heard many complaints that the movie is too cliched, too cheesy, too hokie, to formulaic.  THAT'S THAT POINT!  It's Burton poking fun at the 'by-the-book' horror movies.  To me, some of the funniest parts in the movie were the most cliched because it's ALL tongue-in-cheek.  The movie's got the usual cliched chase scene, the usual 'villain-tells-plans' scene, the usual cheesy lines ('You've bewitched me.'....'Is he dead?' 'That's the problem. He was already dead.'), but that's what MAKES this movie, the fact that it can completely poke fun at the genre while being a great movie on the side. Not only is Burton a master at this sort of double-handed perspective, his visuals, the dark and foreboding world he has created, is something which must be seen in order to be believed.  He truly is a visionary of film. And the actors/actresses....if I were to start with them, I'd be here typing all day.  Let's just say that each one is PERFECT for their given roles, Depp and Ricci, especially. Same goes for the score. In closing: GO SEE IT ON THE BIG SCREEN!",9,0,0,22 December 1999
The Sixth Sense," By Far, THE BEST movie of 1999
","As the Summary line says, the 6th Sense is by far THE BEST MOVIE of 1999...hands down.  It has everything: intelligence, a few pretty creepy moments, and some of the best acting I've ever seen...coming from the very young and VERY talented Haley Joel Osment who outacts nearly every actor I've ever seen.  And the ending....well, you'll just have to see the movie to believe it. Go see this movie.  Go see it again, and again...",10,0,0,2 September 1999
