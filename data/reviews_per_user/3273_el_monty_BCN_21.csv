The Blair Witch Project," I wish I hadn't known
","When Blair Witch was released in Europe, it was inevitable to go to see it with a high level of curiosity and expectations, given all the rave reviews and incredible box office numbers it got in the States. Unfortunately, one of the things we were hearing about it was not correct: that it was a horror movie.Because I don't think it is, or at least that it doesn't respond to the perceived conventions of that genre. Blair Witch IS a superb exercise of growing tension, suspense and anguish, with an increasingly oppressive atmosphere which gradually grips you and drags you into the nightmare that these three kids, normal people like you and me, suddenly find themselves in. You know as little as they do, and you don't need any more, because your imagination does the rest. And your perception of the film gets even better the more you think and reflect upon what you have seen. I was entirely satisfied. But this is undoubtedly an arthouse film, and it seems to me that many people had misguidedly gone to see it expecting a slick, popcorn-friendly, Kevin-Williamsonish scare-fest with lots of surprise shocks and a blood-drenched grand finale. Which it certainly is not. Therefore, I can understand why so many complain about it having disappointed them so much.For me, only one thing could have made it better: having been able to see it without knowing it was fake, like the first people who saw it in the States did. When I came out of the cinema, a couple of ladies behind me, who had somehow managed to avoid all the hype and press coverage, were asking with worried faces '...but did they ever find the bodies?'. And I envied them deeply.",7,0,1,5 November 1999
The New World," Pure Malick... and it almost worked!
","SPOILERS GALOREI went to see this film knowing full well what I was getting into. I know that Malick's unmistakable style can be both a blessing and a curse; he is able to create absolutely beautiful scenes that have the power to stay in your mind, but his storytelling pace and his penchant for getting distracted with a tiny flower growing at the edge of the road can be infuriating. I was ready to be enchanted, but I also knew there was a high risk of, well, being bored. Still, it's Malick, and I had to see it. And the thing is, during the first half of the film, I wasn't bored at all, I was enjoying it tremendously. You could recognize Malick in every carefully constructed frame, of course, but I felt the pace was brisk (at least by his standards), things kept happening, and this story, about culture clashes, communication without words, life in the wild, and the assault on an environment, was an absolutely perfect fit for his particular filming style. And the falling in love was beautiful... nobody does intimacy like Malick. It felt like it was going to be a great variation of Romeo & Juliet (it even has the detail of the girl's brother getting killed by the enemy). And I thought I was finally going to thoroughly enjoy a Malick film from start to finish, something I've always wanted to do but have found myself unable to. But alas, it was not to be. And the problem for me was not in the pace, but in the story. We suddenly enter a second half in which John Smith leaves, and the love story is over. All we're left with is Pocahontas's loneliness, her progressive adaptation to western life, her passionless marriage to Rolfe, and the inexorable growth of Jamestown. Which is all fine, and I suppose also more or less historically accurate, but just not nearly as interesting. The story just loses its drive. And even when Pocahontas learns that her true love is still alive... well, nothing much happens either! So once again I found myself feeling bored, despite my efforts not to, and despite Q'Orianka Kilcher's magnificent performance. A pity then, because it is a fine film, as you would expect, but it feels to me like an opportunity missed. Still, it has many virtues and eventually I will want to see it again, because I know I always appreciate Malick's films better in a second viewing, when I'm aware of the turns that the story is going to take. And we're probably gonna have to wait 10 years for the next Malick film anyway..!PS: Oh, and I LOVED James Horner's music. I didn't know where to mention it, but I just had to say it!",6,3,6,25 February 2006
Mission: Impossible III," Breathtaking, non-stop action... sets a new benchmark for the genre
","M:I 2 was, frankly, crap, so I had difficulty finding friends who were willing to pay the price of a ticket to see this one with me. But I suspected that, after the disappointment that was the first sequel, they wouldn't have bothered making another one unless they had a really good idea for it. Boy was I right! I am a seasoned cinemagoer, and I love action films, so I've seen my share of them and then some. You'd think I would be ready to handle more or less anything a screen could throw at me...As I came out of the cinema from seeing this, with my mouth just gawping with awe, a friend in the group asked me for the phone number of another friend who wasn't there. And as I fumbled with the keys of my cellphone trying to find it for her, I realized why it was being so difficult: My hands were trembling. In fact, my whole body was feeling weak and shaky from all the pent-up tension. No other movie, ever, has done that to me.There is an old adage in movies that says that, to make a good one, you start with an earthquake and go upwards from there. Well, it may be a joke, but M:I 3 achieves almost exactly that. It is a smorgasbord of non-stop action, a roaring juggernaut which just never gives you a break to get your breath back. Every time you think it has reached a point where things will have to slow down, something happens and you're gripping the arms of your chair once again. Such is the abundance and quality of the action scenes, that at one crucial point of the adventure, the movie is so daring as to momentarily stop following Hunt's quest altogether (!), probably because what is happening at that time would look tame in comparison with with what comes before and after... And it's not just the action per se, you understand. All those scenes would mean nothing to the viewer if they weren't backed up by a gripping and twisty story, which this time includes such a personal element to it that it is almost impossible not to openly cheer for Ethan Hunt when he gets something sorted, or squirm in anguish when he seems to reach a dead end.I have always considered Die Hard to be the best action film ever made, but now I see this as the only contender strong enough to instill some doubts in that conviction. That's how good it is.",10,1,2,7 September 2006
Unbreakable," I'm sorry but M. Night Shyamalan has no sense of rhythm
","PLOT SPOILERS AHEADOK, so I didn't figure out the twist this time, even though it was basically the same mechanism as in the Sixth Sense (there's a gifted person and a mentor, what if the gifted guy's gift is applied on the mentor as well). And thank God for that, because if I had, again the experience would have been quite pointless. I admit this time I enjoyed it a bit more, one or two scenes stood out (the kid with the gun, Jackson facing the stairs) but still: The problem with Shyamalan's two films is that they are ideas, high concepts, which I think would be great for a short or a medium length feature, but they're just too thin for the two hour movie format. They rely too heavily on the final revelation to make sense, and while you wait for it to come, they lack any semblance of pace and go awwwwfully slowly. If at least Shyamalan was able to come up with other engaging plots to ease the wait, but his attempts (the stories of each ghost in SS, the shaky marriage and the psycho squatter in this one) are just too weak and go nowhere, on top of that Shyamalan seems to need to make time by coming back to things again and again (OK, I'll try my gift on the cameoing director and.. oops no, it didn't work. But after remembering something I already knew anyway, I'll try again and hey, what do you know, in two minutes I found a weirdo psychopath). I was downright bored at times and the only thing that kept me in my seat was the knowledge that Shyamalan would come up with something good for the end. But you know that's not the way it should be.I hope Shyamalan drops the formula for his next film and does something more solid, or else I'm going to stop buying the hype and wait for the videos.",7,0,1,13 January 2001
12 Angry Men," This film should be taught to children in schools
","Anybody in the world who wants or needs to learn something about the concepts of justice, democracy, freedom of speech, fighting against prejudice, reasoned thinking and plain common sense, should see this film. Which means that everybody in the world should see this film. And not just once, but every so often, so that we can keep reminding ourselves of how important these ideas are for a human society to work. Because, using the metaphorical space of a jury room, this is what this film talks about. Many others do as well, but none can reach the viewer as convincingly, with the power, the directness and heartfeltedness of '12 Angry Men'. And that is simply because it is so unbelievably good. This is a masterpiece on not only one but two accounts: Artistically, as the perfect script, the perfect cast and the perfect direction simply cannot be improved upon; the film grips you from the first ballot count to the last minute with such vice-like grip that you almost feel like you are right there sitting in the room with the jurors; and ideologically, as this unsurpassable quality and capacity to absorb the viewer gives it the strength to drive home a moral lesson worthy of a Martin Luther King or Nelson Mandela speech. I hope one day this film will stand alongside 'Catcher in the Rye' and the like in children's school syllabuses the world over, as I consider it one of the great Works of Art of the century and essential viewing for any person who wants to improve his or herself.",10,0,1,16 January 2001
Alexander," It may be as historically accurate as you want, but it's just plain boring
","It seems, as many reviewers in this section rave about, this film is surprisingly historically accurate for what we are used to in Hollywood epics (although not enough for some!). In that respect it is quite didactic, and I thank Oliver Stone for informing me about the life of a very relevant historical figure who, I admit, I didn't know well enough. But taken as a movie, and not a history lesson, I'm sorry guys, but it is boring as hell. And, before you start, I'm not yearning for less 'talky' scenes and more battle scenes. In fact, I found that even the few battle scenes (specially the second battle) became a bit boring in the end. I don't mind large amounts of dialog in a film, in fact I enjoy it (my favourite movie of 2004 was Before Sunset, which is nothing but a dialog), AS LONG AS IT IS INTERESTING TO LISTEN TO! And that's the problem here: much of what is said is just not interesting, because it is too convoluted, or too obvious, or too irrelevant, or too repetitive, or too arid, or too obscure, or too adorned, or just doesn't make any sense. And when you have to listen to this kind of dialog for three hours, you just get bored. Stone has fallen into the same trap as in Nixon: he doesn't know when to stop, when to cut, when to just hint instead of giving you speech after speech. In the end, his biopics become farragos, too arduous to follow. I prefer his lighter films, like U-turn, which may be less profound, but much, much more entertaining.",4,3,4,13 January 2005
Terminator Salvation," Visually spectacular, narratively nonsensical
","As a Terminator fan, I am divided. On one hand, it was undeniably pulse-quickening to finally witness the full rage of the war against the machines depicted with such brutal intensity. The action and the effects were just spectacular, and even though the design of the new robots obviously borrowed from other movies such as Matrix and Transformers, they were still pretty cool. Full marks to McG for the visuals and the direction of the action sequences. But on the other hand, I could not possibly forgive the veritable avalanche of trailer-truck-sized plot holes, which not only disrupt the internal logic of the film itself, but also severely contradict the previous films of the saga, particularly the first one, so close to my heart. Therefore, even though I really wanted to like it, ultimately I cannot approve this installment. Others not as concerned with the canon as myself might not be so bothered...",5,0,1,13 June 2009
Juno," Nothing... happens...
","'A 16 year old girl finds herself pregnant, and decides to give the baby up for adoption.' That might sound like the setup for a movie. You would assume that this sentence would be just the starting block for a story, and then lots of other things would take place. But not in this case. This sentence is actually the synopsis of the entire movie.There is almost no conflict at all in this story. Everybody loves everybody, everybody is supportive of everything, everybody is just fine most of the time; the one glitch that comes up along the way and which enticingly threatens to derail the proceedings, is swiftly resolved the next minute without much apparent consequence.So it's all very nice and heartwarming, but not really conducive to an engaging experience for the viewer. I'm not saying it is a terrible film, actually it flows along pleasantly (if you can put up with the inordinate abuse of quirky incidental music with absurd lyrics, which I sometimes had trouble with), but it barely makes a ripple as it goes.",5,46,94,6 February 2008
Match Point," Best movie of 2005, hands down
","The perfectly fine Crash may have taken the Oscar, and equally good Brokeback Mountain most other awards, but I would say that Woody Allen's first London film was without a shadow of a doubt the best one I saw last year. It is one of the very best Allen has ever made, and that's saying a lot given the man's impressive record. It just kept me constantly on the edge of my seat, asking 'will he or won't he?' at every turn, at every situation and every decision that the despicable character Chris Wilton had to face (and the terrible thing was that I'm pretty sure myself I would not be able to resist the temptation posed by Scarlett Johansson's ravishing beauty, so I couldn't help but empathize with his predicament a bit...). And the ending. Oh my God. What an ending. I didn't see that coming and it was fantastically clever. The film really drove the (very real) point home of how luck plays such a part in everybody's lives... The only weak link in this masterpiece was Jonathan Rhys Meyers's performance; I found him flat and at times not quite believable in his delivery. My girlfriend suggested that this might be due to his efforts not to speak with his Irish accent, and it might be true, for he speaks with an English accent (which is weird, because his character is supposed to be Irish!). This minor glitch is what reduces my grade for the movie to a 9 instead of a perfect 10, but it is minor enough for me to still consider it a masterpiece and recommend it wholeheartedly to everyone.",9,2,4,15 March 2006
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," It managed to turn me to the dark side for a little while there...
","I am not a big fan of either Tim Burton or Broadway musicals, so a combination of the two sounded VERY unappealing to me and I avoided this film for a while. Just a as expected, when I finally sat down to watch it, for the first twenty minutes or so I could hardly stand it, and was very tempted to just stop the DVD player and forget about it. But I decided to hold out until my beloved Sacha Baron Cohen showed up (I'm a big fan of the guy), just to see him, and then the plot started to kick in, and slowly but surely I found myself having to admit I was being entertained (apart from Cohen's appearance, the mid-movie song about the various professions was another high point). The movie indeed gets better and better as it advances to its tragic, macabre climax, and that final image before the credits was rather haunting. So, still no masterpiece in my book, but I'll concede I'm glad I saw it.",6,1,3,24 May 2008
Cast Away," Riveting, against all odds
","PLOT SPOILERS WARNINGYou have to give it to the man. Bob Zemeckis, who I consider one of the best directors in Hollywood, lost some of my appreciation after the dreadful 'Contact' (If even he wasn't able to save that script, maybe it's because it was so bad that nobody could have), but he has proved this year that he is well and truly back on track, first with 'What Lies Beneath' and now with this virtuoso tour-de-force. To keep the spectator glued to the screen for two hours when all you have is one man and a volleyball in a deserted island is almost defying logic, yet Zemeckis manages to pull it off thanks to excellent timing and rhythm, a phenomenal setting (where is this island? I want to go there!), beautifully photographed, and a fabulous, Oscar-worthy performance from Hanks (again... these two were made for each other), portraying the amazing odyssey of endurance and self-discovery of a man who had lost sight of the important things in life. In fact, I was enjoying it so much that I wasn't sure I wanted the poor guy to escape from the island, I wanted to keep watching his adventures...!I loved the relationship of Chuck with his alter ego Wilson, which becomes as real a character as you could wish for (in fact, I can think of a couple of action movie stars who could probably take acting tips from it...), and was truly saddened when Chuck is forced to abandon him. The fact that Zemeckis could extract so much sympathy from an inanimate object, a face painted on a ball, reminds me of how menacing Kubrick could make a round, red and yellow light look in '2001..', or how much Lucas charmed us with R2-D2's grumpy character, even if we couldn't understand anything he said...I also loved the fact that, in keeping with his character, Chuck maintained his 'integrity', what he considered his essence, at least for the first few days, by not opening the boxes. It did bug me a bit that, when the circumstances force him to do so, he left one of them unscathed to serve as a symbol, a reminder of his former self and his mission in life (as the note says, 'This box saved my life'). I thought it was a little bit unrealistic, and I was fearing some terrible but daft final revelation about it ('look! a cellphone!'); but in the end it turns out that what the box contains is not important ('Pulp Fiction' style), but what it represents, which is not only his mission, but his new future, 'brought in by the tide..' (If he hadn't saved it, he would never had met his future partner... come on, did anybody really not get the hint of where he was going after the final scene?). Nice final touch.All in all, a beautiful film and a great performance by Hanks and Zemeckis. They were robbed of a bunch of Oscars, if you ask me.",9,0,0,18 January 2001
Armageddon," This grows on you
","I remember that after seeing Armageddon for the first time, I went to look it up in IMDb, and I gave it a 6. I didn't flunk it because I had to admit that it was entertaining fun, but at the time I was miffed by the fact that it was a ridiculously, absurdly exaggerated plot, blatantly manipulative and without the faintest shade of seriousness, verisimilitude or believability. And directed like an MTV video, as you would expect from Bay. God forgive me, I even remember saying I preferred Deep Impact!A couple of years later and after seeing it two or three more times, all those things that I saw as defects I now consider as its virtues. Precisely because it dispenses completely with believability and is played continuously and exclusively for kicks, is why I love it so much now. I am amazed at the capacity this film has to grab you and take you in a roller-coaster ride, even if you know perfectly what's going to happen; I clench my fists, I bite my nails, I laugh out loud, I cry; every time I see it. My latest rating for it is a 9; I have some trouble giving it the 10 that is reserved for sublime masterpieces, but who knows, maybe I just need to see it one more time...",9,7,11,12 February 2000
No Country for Old Men," What?
","I think I must have seen a different movie from everyone else because I just don't get it. The film I saw was an engaging but plot-hole ridden cat-and-mouse chase story which suddenly came to an abrupt and anticlimactic conclusion, and then for half an hour went off into extraneous tangents. I didn't feel satisfied. At all. Besides, I wasn't that impressed with Bardem's performance, he seemed very artificial to me. I don't know, maybe I will have to try watching it again to see what everyone else seems to see in this. But the prospect of watching it a second time is not very appealing, to be honest.",4,1,5,11 April 2009
The Hurt Locker," Didn't really work for me, I got a bad vibe from the political undertones
","Given the critics' enthusiasm, I went to see it with high expectations, and I came out frankly disappointed. The atmosphere felt realistic and some scenes (the sniper duel, the man with the explosive vest) made quite an impact; but I really had a problem with the central character, William James. I may be overpoliticized, but I just couldn't help perceiving him as a perfect embodiment of George W. Bush's America: Gung-ho, arrogant, reckless, impulsive, willing to put the lives of his comrades at risk and to abandon a loving family at home in order to pursue personal vendettas and get his adrenalin rushes... and, as I do with Bush, I despised him; I was almost rooting for him to get blown up, to be honest, because I thought he was a complete idiot who did almost everything wrong, and that he had no place in any serious professional army (something confirmed by opinions from war veterans I have read later). And yet Bigelow seems intent on portraying him as something of a 'misguided hero', the classic rogue who doesn't go by the book but whose heart is in the right place. Therefore, it felt to me as if the movie, by condoning this man's reckless attitude, was somewhat also condoning the U.S. military campaign as something maybe equally misguided but nevertheless brave and noble. I have no idea where Bigelow stands politically, and I realize this might not be the message she wanted to convey at all; but it's the one I perceived, and it left me quite uncomfortable.",4,5,12,5 March 2010
From Dusk Till Dawn," Instructions to watch From Dusk Till Dawn
","If you have never seen From Dusk Till Dawn, I think the experience will be more enjoyable for you if you follow these simple instructions: <ul><li>Put the DVD/Blu-Ray into the player and press 'Play' </li></ul><ul><li>Yow will start watching a movie about two fugitive robbers, one of them a paranoid, sex-obsessed psycho, who cross paths with the family of a preacher who has lost his faith after the tragic death of his wife.</li></ul><ul><li>Enjoy the tense and riveting thriller, which boasts some great dialogue, brilliant direction, and good performances from a cast that oozes charisma; even Tarantino does a decent job. (The only weak point is the Chinese lad who plays Harvey Keitel's son, and who seems incapable to convey any emotion whatsoever, but it's just a minor drawback.) </li></ul><ul><li>When the characters arrive at the Titty Twister, you might notice the film starting to become a little corny, but don't worry, just hold on for a minute, the best scene of the movie is coming up.</li></ul><ul><li>Marvel and drool at the phenomenal physique of Salma Hayek, whose body is so perfect in this movie she seem almost superhuman. Even if you're a lady, you will have to agree that her scene is definitely something out of the ordinary.</li></ul><ul><li>As soon as the music ends and George Clooney says the famous line, 'Now that's what I call a f***ing show!', STOP THE PLAYER.</li></ul><ul><li>Not just stop the player, but eject the disc, put it in the box, and take it back to the video store right away. This is to avoid the temptation you might have to press 'PLAY' again sometime later in the day, which you would regret.</li></ul><ul><li>Now go for a walk, or sit in your favourite a bar with a drink, and try to imagine how the story might continue from that point on. Maybe Tarantino jumps on Juliette Lewis and forces Harvey Keitel to finally confront the brothers and bring them to justice (with the help of Satanico, who ironically turns out to be a devout Christian); maybe when Carlos arrives he turns out to be an undercover Mexican Federal working with the FBI and the brothers continue their escape taking the family (and Satanico) with them deeper into Mexico and becoming more and more desperate along the way; maybe 'Carlos' double-crosses them and they are all forced to hole themselves up in the bar and fight together for their lives against the Mexican mob...</li></ul><ul><li>but WHATEVER you come up with, I guarantee you this: it will be better than the absurd silliness that Tarantino and Rodriguez cooked up, ruining what could have otherwise been a very good film. Therefore, your viewing experience of From Dusk Till Dawn will be better than that of all the people who have had the misfortune of watching the whole thing from start to finish and witnessing how something that could have been great was trashed by a childish whim.</li></ul><ul><li>You're welcome :-)</li></ul>",5,10,20,13 February 2011
This Is Spinal Tap," One of the funniest comedies ever made. And that's the truth!
","How many times has this happened to you: You hear and you read endless amounts of praise about an old film which is considered a classic in its genre, and for some reason you've never had a chance to see it, and then when you get round to watching it, even if it's reasonably good, it dissapoints you, because it just can't live up to all those years of hype you've been exposed to.This has certainly happened to me with lots of films, and, as I went into the cinema to see Spinal Tap for the first time, in its recent UK re-release, I feared it would happen again. For years I had been reading article after article after review invariably claiming this film to be one of the most hilarious ever made, a masterpiece of comedy, and of course I was dying to see it; but I was sure that if I saw it expecting 'one of the funniest comedies ever' (and there was no way I could avoid that), it would not measure up, no way, and I would be sadly disappointed... againThe wonderful thing was that I wasn't, not at all: That's how good Spinal Tap is. It took for me a little while to get into the dynamic of it, but when Nigel started having problems with the size of the bread I just began to laugh out loud and I hardly stopped throughout the film, I couldn't help myself. The astounding creativity and wit of the cast and director, coming up with those scenes and those lines most of the time by improvising, never ceases to amaze me. And the characters were instantly lovable and memorable, despite (or, more precisely, because of) their abysmal stupidity. I just couldn't get enough of them, and the film, though it is actually quite short, seemed CRIMINALLY short to me when the credits started rolling.In a few months I have gone from being a Spinal Tap ignoramus to a die hard fan, and a viewing of the DVD satiated my hunger for more with a glorious extra hour of outtakes which are just as funny as what Reiner (sorry, Di Bergi) left in. How could I live for so many years not having seen it? I just don't know.So if you still haven't seen it, all I can say is that you really don't know what you're missing. Improve your life: watch Spinal Tap.",9,1,4,4 April 2001
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Good but not great
","Despite not being one of Allen's best efforts, VCB is above other recent outings. It's an interesting and adult story, a bit of a throwback to his late 80s/early 90s sex/love/relationships dramas, after a stint of crime stories and silly comedies. The exceptionally good looking cast and setting (my city :-) also help maintain the interest, of course, and the photography is brilliant. The story is irregular, however, in that it strains credibility at some points, while at others you feel it doesn't go as far as it could have, some characters seeming to be let off too easy from their predicaments; and the performances are irregular as well, Cruz and Hall being the obvious standouts, and Johansson the weakest link. The voice-over narration, while necessary, is a bit excessive. And the songs are, quite frankly, unbearable!",7,0,2,26 March 2009
The Sixth Sense," Knowing there is a twist is knowing too much
","Okay, so you're in the reviews section of IMDb, so that means that you are a bit of a film buff, so by this time, even if you haven't seen the movie, you have already read somewhere that there is a huge twist at the end, so I'm not spoiling it to you by telling you 'there is a twist', am I?Well, the trouble is, I am. European audiences have heard about the success of this movie in the States, and have heard about there being a twist, so most of us see it expecting it to come. And if you expect it, it is really quite obvious and easy to figure out long before it happens, there are many hints (put there so that everything makes sense at the end, of course). And it's not even such an original idea, we've seen similar things in other famous movies (which I won't mention so as not to give away too much). The whole movie relies very much on this final revelation, and until it comes, it just doesn't have anything consistent to say, there is never any real feeling of menace, which surely is the worst that can happen to a horror film(I do think, though, that the performances are quite decent, especially Osment's, given the difficulty of his role. But the pace could certainly be better). So if you see it without being surprised by the ending, the whole thing doesn't seem so impressive. A bit empty really. OK, but nothing extraordinary. I'd say 6.5 out of 10.",6,0,0,7 November 1999
Slumdog Millionaire," Can't really see what the fuss is about
","When a film hinges on some improbable coincidence in order to push the story forward, it is generally considered bad or lazy writing... so I can't help but wonder why this film, in which the crux of the story is a gigantic, ludicrous combination of very improbable coincidences, is being regarded as a masterpiece. I suppose it still works as something of a modern fairytale, like Pretty Woman, and it definitely does have a couple of very good moments, but ultimately it was just impossible for me to take seriously such an exaggeratedly contrived story.After it ended, my fiancée said that she was half-expecting it to end with a Usual Suspects scene, in which the whole thing would be revealed to be an elaborate tale invented for a policeman's ears by a street-hardened conman; I would have found it to be a much better film if it had been that way, actually!",5,3,4,20 March 2009
Contact," This has to be the most overrated movie of the 90's.
","WARNING! SPOILERS ABOUND IN THIS REVIEWThere are mysteries in the world which are completely unfathomable to me. And one of them is why anyone can consider this film to be any good at all. I have never walked out of a movie theatre, but when I went to see this, I was more tempted than ever.It is true that it had a promising start, with the first alien signal being detected by scientists; but from that point on, it goes downhill at the speed of light. Apparently, it is supposed to be a realistic hypothesis on how contact with an alien civilization could take place. But for me the story is completely unbelievable, and so full of holes that they are too many to list them all... I don't believe NASA would ever handle things the way they do in the film, I don't believe the church, let alone some neo-hippy preacher, would have squat to say in how things were handled, I don't believe a terrorist could ever get that easily to the very centre of the most expensive and important structure ever built by mankind, I don't believe some rich guy could set up a secret spaceship orbiting the earth aside from the powers that be, just like that, I don't believe NASA would be so keen to discredit the tale of their chosen ambassador, especially having proof (the hours of blank tape) that there was some truth in it, and I ABSOLUTELY do not believe aliens would show up in a virtual beach with the face and voice of some poor girl's dead daddy. It is all so ridiculously contrived and movie-like that I simply cannot understand the general public's perception that all of this is 'realistic', 'profound' or 'brainy'. For me, it's right down there with Independence Day in those departments. And on top of that, it's as boring as watching paint dry. At least Independence Day was fun, what the heck.Being generous, I rate it 2/10, for the F/X.",2,33,75,7 November 1999
Donnie Darko," Bah... it's all just hype
","Well... when this movie was released in my country, I still hadn't read much about it, I only had a notion that it was causing a bit of a stir in the US; but I had the feeling that it would be just one of those gimmicky, pretentious 'weirdo' movies that come along from time to time, and which people choose for no apparent reason to become cult movies; and then when you watch them you see right through them and realise that it was all just hype. So I passed.But then the whole Donnie Darko thing has ballooned so much throughout the year, that I found it impossible to go on without finding out what the fuss was about. So I rented it.And you know what? I was right all along. There's nothing here but hype.Please don't give me that 'You're just dissing it because you're not smart enough to understand it' line. If I don't understand it, it means the director and the writer (who happen to be the same person) didn't do their job right. Don't compare it to Memento; there's no problem in understanding Memento, as long as you pay attention. This just doesn't make any bloody sense. Don't tell me to read the friggin Philosophy book; if I'm required to read some text to understand what was on the screen, then this Kelly guy had better find a different line of work. And yes, since you ask, I have read the thing, and it explains the story, and you know what, it still isn't very good. A story that needs to be so painstakingly explained to make sense, becomes hollow.I hope everyone will continue to have fun endlessly debating the 'finer points' of this gobbledygook. Me, I'd rather watch real films.",2,8,15,12 December 2002
