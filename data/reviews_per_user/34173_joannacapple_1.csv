It," Not Scary Enough
","The movie was a good, despite the fact that all the jump scares could be seen from a mile alway. I was already expecting them before they happened. I was genuinely bored when they showed 5 scenes in a row with the same jump scare each time. The movie did not make sense at all, there were random scenes here and there and the most interesting one of all is the opening scene. I was very confused with what was going on the entire time due to the movie leaving the audience with poor clues to what was going on. I would watch this movie again but for laughs, not scares.",7,1,1,14 September 2019
