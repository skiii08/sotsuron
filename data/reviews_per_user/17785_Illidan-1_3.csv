Requiem for a Dream," You must watch it..
","This movie isn't just a movie to have fun.It gives you a strong punch to your stomach because it approaches the truth,and always truth is a hard thing to accept..A film with educational character..What more can you accept..All people who are related directly or indirectly with drugs and substances must see it..Meybe they will stop the inevitable..Gongratulations to all those who participated.The actors couldn't be more persuasive and real..All of them..These film will always be one of the best ever..Take it straight into you...It will only give you one angle of the truth..People being humiliated and degraded..for what?Life's lost..For what?For drugs...This is insane...We only live once..No drug can be more important than life itself..",10,2,4,14 January 2006
Predator," Solid and adventurous..
",Although the movie may seem 'old' compared with today's super special fxs movies it is by far superior to many of them.It was far ahead of it's time when it was released in 1987 and opened the way for many directors to copy many of it's ideas.Actors including Arnold and all the others may not have nominated ever for an Oscar but they do give each one a marvelous acting all following the director's guidelines and the scenario.What makes this movie a 'must see sci-fi' is the dark atmosphere which is created and the veil of death which surrounds everyone from the military companions not knowing where death will strike..Some movies remain forever untouched by time.This one is one of them..,10,2,3,24 March 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Breathtaking action..
","The third episode which closes the first star wars period is how it should be..marvelous..Everything here is so well built that there are moments in the movie,that make you change colours and mood so quickly,all too unexpected and swift..No doubt best visual fxs ever,best picture,and story plot.All things are unfolding in an enormous speed,young anakin chooses so fast to join the dark side,and everything turns the upside down.Disaster for everyone..Performances are quite pleasing with McGregor giving a moving and more mature acting as obi-wan,and Christensen giving a convincing performance of someone who really is confused and chooses power from love..Heyden i think will make his mark in Hollywood..MacGregor already marks with his performances.The movie is a science-fiction highlight,and proudly closes the first cycle of star wars.Loucas did it again.He knows better..This movie can only be enjoyed,And i enjoyed it..May the force be with us..just once..",9,3,5,20 May 2005
