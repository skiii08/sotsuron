Casablanca," Timeless classic
","Truly one of the most remarkable films ever made; from the witty dialogue to the stunning photography to the beautiful acting, I cannot praise this movie too much. Almost immediately you enter into a visual spectacle from the beautiful reflections on the walls of the Cafe Americain to beautiful women dressed in sparkly costumes to Rick in his perfectly pressed, white dinner jacket we enter a world of sophistication and beauty. We quickly learn however that there are real troubles just beneath the surface. Immediately we learn that 2 German couriers have been murdered. The police suspect the murderer is at Rick's caf√© but before the police arrest the suspect he asks Rick to hold the transport papers he stole from the Germans which are the keys to freedom from the German controlled, but unoccupied French Moroccan city of Casablanca. Rick is suave, sophisticated and clever until Ilsa walks in,the woman who broke his heart. We learn that the two had a love affair in Paris and as they were about to leave Paris together right before the German occupation Ilsa did not meet Rick at the train station when she was supposed to. She sent a note along with Sam that said she was not coming. Needless to say Rick was bitter when she shows up in his Cafe but over time he does find out why Ilsa left him. He is also inspired on how to use the transport papers. While the overall focus of the movie is the love story between Rick and Ilsa and the sacrifices made for love, the Nazi threat is made all to real. The release of the movie 6 months after the United States' involvement in WWII, shined a light on how terrifying it must have been for people trying to escape. I think everyone should watch this movie again and again to remind us all that even in the absolutely worst of times love can conquer anything.",10,1,3,5 March 2015
Citizen Kane," Remarkable!
","I can see why this movie is on the top of everyone's lists; I can't stop thinking about it! 'Citizen Kane is rich with symbolism, layers upon layers of meaning and incredible cinematography. From Kane's death bed utterance to the final scene I was spellbound! I keep thinking about why Kane did what he did, who he was trying to replace with all the life size statues he brought back from Europe and what Kane's life might have looked like if his parents didn't send him packing for a neat $50,000 a year. My interpretation of Citizen Kane is this: the man, Charles Foster Kane seeks desperately to replace his mother who sent him away as a young boy but no amount of expensive statuary can replace the love he was denied as a child. His youth went up in smoke just as all his childhood treasures in the movie's final scene. A must see film, not only is the story thought provoking, the camera work, lighting and each frame from the film is a treasure.",9,3,4,18 March 2015
Taxi Driver," Disturbing
","I did not like this movie and I will be happy if I never see it again. The ONLY bright spot was Travis saving the 12 year old prostitute and sending her back home to her parents but I have to say I found the rest of the movie very confusing. For example, for a man who thought the city was full of immorality and degenerates why did he think it was all right to spent his free time in X Rated theaters? And what made him think it was OK to take a girl he just met to a porn film? Also, what possessed him to cut his hair into a mohawk and why did it appear that he was going to kill the nominee for president when he ended up killing Iris's pimp? The only answers I was able to come up with was as a former Marine, he needed to validate himself once he re-entered society. Since the secret service were onto him he went for the next best thing and managed to save a young girl in the process. Thank God all that porn didn't cloud the inappropriateness of a 12 year old turning tricks!",3,5,10,27 April 2015
Annie Hall," Witty and Inventive
","After watching this film it is easy to see why it won Best Picture; the love story between Alvy (Woody Allen) and Annie (Diane Keaton) provided the audience with hilarious dialogue and very funny scenes. The creative elements of the film brought it over the top. As Woody Allen's character, Alvy has been stuck in therapy since he was a kid, it's not surprising that he feels the constant need to analyze his relationship with Annie, it's eventual demise and his part in their breakup. Allen breaking the 4th wall to talk directly to the audience was brilliant and made you feel like you were part of the action. The split screens, subtitles and the Wicked Queen cartoon added additional layers to the story. The scenery of Manhattan was pretty awesome too. If you want to see a clever, well written and funny movie you cannot do better than Annie Hall.",9,0,0,27 April 2015
The Graduate," Fresh and Funny
","This movie definitely takes a different approach from movies in the past but provides a fresh and humorous view of an adulterous relationship. As Ben becomes entangled with the provocative Mrs. Robinson his emotions take him on a roller coaster ride of highs and lows. Add to the mix, Mrs. Robinson's beautiful daughter Elaine and dear Ben becomes a frantic mess. Eventually Ben realizes that it's time to step out of the manipulative shadows of the adults and follow his heart. There are many clever shots throughout the movie, especially Mrs Robinson's bent leg framing Ben and the underwater swimming pool scenes and the dialogue is witty and funny. An abundance of water is also seen in this film and I was curious to the symbolism regarding all the water; I googled it and one theory suggests that the water is the womb and Ben as a recent grad going through an existential crisis is reluctant to come out of the water and leave the womb. My feelings are that the water represents the innocence of youth which Ben clearly had until Mrs. Robinson decided to make a man out of him. Well written and beautifully filmed it is definitely a must see.",8,0,0,22 April 2015
Singin' in the Rain," Delightful
","This movie will have you singing the title song for days after seeing the movie and every time you hear the title! This movie is more than a singing and dancing sensation however as it is the story of two silent film stars who must transition into the world of talking pictures. The transition is hilarious as the female lead, the glamorous Lina Lamont has a voice that could easily be compared to nails on a chalkboard. Gene Kelly, portraying the male lead Don Lockwood and his brilliant childhood friend Cosmo, played by the wonderful Donald O'Connor, come up with the brilliant idea to use the voice of the beautiful Kathy Selden, played by Debbie Reynolds, for Lina's in the movie. Of course Lina has been jealous of Kathy's involvement from the start and that's when the real fun begins. In addition to the hilarious storyline this picture includes some of the best dance moves I've ever seen and the singing talent is legendary. Shot is beautiful Technicolor this movie is not to be missed.",8,0,1,28 March 2015
Pulp Fiction," Jaw dropping
","Quentin Tarantino takes you on one wild ride in this movie with the out there dialogue, the violence, the music, the drugs, the dancing and the 50's themed diner! The overall message of this spectacle in my opinion is that eventually you have to come down,whether it is from the high of blowing people away, from snorting heroin and over dosing and getting a shot of adrenaline in your heart to going back into a dangerous situation to do the right thing even when you want to run away. This movie is fast paced, laugh at loud funny at times and sometimes blush worthy but most importantly it is unforgettable. This is a modern classic that should not be missed.",8,0,1,8 May 2015
