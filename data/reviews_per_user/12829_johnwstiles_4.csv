Marie Antoinette," real flesh and blood
","The singular accomplishment of Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette is the rendering of a two dimensional historical figure and time into real flesh and blood. Kirsten Dunst's performance is powerful but it is Coppola's direction and Lance Acord's cinematography that brings the teenage queen off the tired page that's been her home for the past century and a half and into our experience. Coppola wastes no time in throwing us into the madness that was pre-revolutionary France. She wants us on Marie's side as she reacts to the absurd structure and strictures of the French court at Versailles. This is ridiculous, she complains early on and we couldn't agree more. The pressure to consummate the arranged marriage to Louis Auguste (the only miscue was Jason Schwartzman as Louis) is almost too much to bear for the sixteen year old Marie and we become fans immediately. Coppola spares us yet another version of the French Revolution as we see only a grumbling mob near the end. Marie silences the mob with a balcony bow. Her reaction to their sudden silence tells us everything we need to know. She can't believe what she sees. We can, though, and therein lies the brilliance of Coppola's work.",Null,1,2,8 November 2006
The Departed," life is brutish and short and we should be grateful for any illusion of peace we can muster
","Martin Scorsese is a brilliant filmmaker and all his films are must sees. When he's plumbing the depths of his bad guy obsession his films can be simultaneously riveting and repulsive. The Departed qualifies on all counts, must see, riveting and repulsive. DiCaprio is Scorsese's new DeNiro and he is the centerpiece of the latest Scorsese descent into death. Cormac McCarthy says any writer unwilling to deal with death isn't serious. If this is so then McCarthy is as serious as any writer has ever been. His latest, The Road, deals with nearly everyone's death in a post-apocalyptic world of cannibalism and ash. Not far removed from McCarthy's world of dead people is Scorsese's world of people fixing to be dead. No happy endings (no surprise), awful lot of brains blown out, and an awesome display of acting from DiCaprio. You have to wonder where the anguish and anger he shows us in his interview with Wahlberg and Sheen come from. Watching Vera Farmiga as police shrink watch her boyfriend Matt Damon talk to Nicholson on his cell made us want to see much more of her.Scorsese seems to have a visceral hatred of snitches. Rats abound in The Departed and we have trouble telling the difference between the good and bad guys at first. They all end up bad guys by the time all the blood is let. Scorsese works hard to make us sympathize with DiCaprio's character and if we can see past the anger and beatings administered by him we do care more for him than anyone. I couldn't tell if Nicholson's charm was innate or Scorsese's manipulation but we shouldn't like the head bad guy, right? Even when he does his rat impersonation? Right? Maybe Martin is talking to us about honor, about being true, about the damnation visited upon the liar. Or maybe he's just saying the world is an ugly and violent place, life is brutish and short and we should be grateful for any illusion of peace we can muster.",Null,0,0,8 November 2006
The Last King of Scotland," What is it about sub-Saharan Africa that attracts such monumental evil?
","Lots of buzz about Forest Whitaker made this a must see. The rehabilitation of Idi Amin would be a tough sell for the poster child of evil African dictator. An amateur pugilist he was rumored to have dealt death sentences personally. Clearly much too much larger than life to render meaningfully into a two hour film. Kevin Macdonald does his cause little service by having us divide our focus with a dilettante child doctor. James McAvoy is easy to watch but the character he is asked to play is so thin and poorly drawn as to be little more than distraction. I turned to my friend when our young doctor decides to sleep with Amin's number three wife and asked, 'is any one that stupid?' She answered correctly, ' young boys.' I heard that once before from a woman priest describing a male colleague working his girlfriend's gams into a sermon. We do some pretty amazing things when in the clutch of testosterone. Nonetheless, it was too much to ask that we believe even a Scottish rake would risk torture and death for a roll in the hay. Come to think of it, Gillian Anderson (Scully from the X-Files) playing a sunbleached British nurse could get me to risk much. But I digress. As did The Last King of Scotland. Too often Amin's maniacal behavior was foreshadowed and too often we knew what was coming. The raid on Entebbe even made an appearance. We were asked to believe a Scottish doctor was smuggled out on the Gentile plane that left early on in the stand-off between Palestinian hijackers and the Israeli government. The Last King had a Readers Digest feel to it, extra large type and condensed to the point of a PowerPoint presentation.What is it about sub-Saharan Africa that attracts such monumental evil? 300,000 Ugandans lost their lives under Amin, more than that were hacked to death in the eighties when the Hutu and Tutsi's went at it. Several hundred thousand are dead and dying under Sudanese rule. We cluck our tongue and bemoan the price of gas. What do we say to our children? We were too busy adjusting our 401K to do anything?",Null,3,7,8 November 2006
The Queen," This was nearly as much a film about Princess Di as it was about Queen Elizabeth.
","This was nearly as much a film about Princess Di as it was about Queen Elizabeth. The film takes place largely over the ten days following Diana's death when England mourned publicly and the Queen hid away at the Royal retreat at Balmoreal. I'm not sure the value of this sort of film. It's great that the Queen is a real person and all but did we think she wasn't? As an exploration of changing English values, stiff upper lip gives way to public wailing, I think the jury may still be out on that. Maybe it's about the power of television to equalize. Di beats Liz like she stole something sort of thing? No, that can't be. Maybe it's just what it appears to be, a study of The Queen. As such it certainly succeeds. We can't help but like the poor dear when she breaks her aging Land Rover, expertly diagnoses the problem, calls for help, sobs silently over her travails, admires and saves a beautiful deer from certain death. In one three minute scene we see her competence, humanity, vulnerability and love of nature. It's all done perfectly by the sure handed Stephen Frears and could, as a short film, accomplished the same objective. But then we would have missed the footage of Diana and, sap that I am, I was as moved by that as I was Mirren's powerful and understated performance.",Null,0,1,8 November 2006
