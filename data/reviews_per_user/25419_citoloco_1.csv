The Blair Witch Project," This is a fair $22,000 movie, nothing more or less
","From what I understand, this movie was shot for about $22,000, not including post-production costs.  It is just that, a fair $22,000 movie, nothing more or less.  I liked the premise, but with a budget this miniscule, even Orson Welles could only do so much.  The only people who may find it frightening are those that have never spent any time in the woods at night, and as such might find the dark and the occasional bump in the night unsettling.  This film has no special effects, no substantive screenwriting (most of the dialogue consists of the principals shouting 'f*ck' you, this etc.) and no compelling performances in it.  Cheap shaky-cam shots abound, however, of third-rate actors portraying sniveling characters coming unglued after spending a day or two, mostly intentionally, in the forest despite having plenty of food, water and shelter.  Save your money and go see 'The Sixth Sense' instead.",5,0,2,29 August 1999
