Skyfall," 007 at his finest
","Skyfall celebrates a long running franchise that spans 50 years and staples itself as one of the best so far. After the misfire that was Quantum of Solace, Bond is back in a form we haven't quite seen before. Director Sam Mendes anchors a brilliant script and adds meaning to what was previously a character without much layers. Mendes doesn't shy away from giving us a splendid variation of visual flairs, making this Bond the most aesthetic yet. This time around we see 007 face his own vulnerabilities after having been accidentally shot down by his own team. Bond retires the life of espionage, inducing himself in alcohol, with no purpose, only to be brought back by a mysterious hacker who has targeted MI6, more precisely, M herself. After a rigorous regime to get James back in shape, the agent is back as he tracks down this new threat. Enter the villain. With a superb one shot introduction, we meet Javier Bardem's Silva, a blond haired, weirdly camp and psychotic-in-a-fun way villain that delivers right from the start with a monologue that couldn't be better written for him to chew off. Him and Bond bounce back and forth like a pro tennis match, each trying to gage the other, Silva sometimes sexually. This is where protagonist meets antagonist in a perfect symbiosis. The action remains thrilling, relying in more realistic sequences rather than bombastic set pieces often seen in the Pierce Brosnan era. One sequence especially serves as Bond's best hand to hand combat. The Bond girl here is Judi Dench, as she owns the role one last time. She is as much a Bond girl as he is M's guy. The relationship between Bond and M almost mirrors one of a lost son and a mother without one. All in all, Skyfall delivers in almost all fronts. Sam Mendes has crafted a beautiful, intelligent and relevant film that brings James Bond back as one of the most iconic spies of all time.",9,4,7,30 October 2017
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," A virtual theatrical experience
","Every now and then a film will perfectly illustrate an art form not yet showcased on screen. For example, Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan for dancers or Damien Chazelle's Whiplash for musicians, and now Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's Birdman for actors. The seamlessly visceral one-take wonder is what made this project immediately a unique experience. Now, of course, there are obvious spots that do suggests cuts have been made but it never detaches you from the action. It flows fluidly, always shifting gears at every corner, making this an organic and lively watch, almost as if you were witnessing a theatrical performance. We begin with our lead character Riggan, played by Michael Keaton, levitating off the ground in his dressing room in a meditative pose. This already suggests it isn't going to be an ordinary flick with formulaic characters. From there, the camera weaves along, flowing from scene to scene aqueously without any pause as the score presents itself in the form of beats, as if the drummer was improvising the whole picture. Each character is then presented, as wacky and fresh as the next, perfectly acted from a star studded cast, in particular Edward Norton who steals almost every scene. But let me make this clear, this is Michael Keaton's movie, almost in a literal sense, playing an aged out actor who once was a Hollywood star that donned the famous Birdman suit (Can you see the correlation here?) Now, no longer a household name and only remembered by an older generation, he tries to make a comeback in a bold way, by adapting, directing and performing in his own stage production that could break the chains and make him into the artist he's always aspired to be. Keaton puts on a mesmerising performance that is as moving as Inurratu's camera-work, showing a plethora of emotions that will encapsulate your own. This movie serves up everything you'd want out of it in a silver platter. It is groundbreaking, almost to the point of being pure magic. It's a theatrical moving picture that reinvents the definition of cinema and why we need it so much.",10,1,3,30 October 2017
