The Blair Witch Project," Originality and horror meet to create a masterpiece
","I got the opportunity to see the Blair Witch Project on its opening night at a midnight showing.  What a fantastic way to see a truly horrifying movie. Personally I thought that the movie was scary but the more I think about it the more terrified I become.  Almost every aspect of this movie is outstanding.  The camera work adds so much to making the experience more realistic, and while you are watching it you can almost feel what the characters are feeling.  And I found the movie overall to be very original, which is wonderful to see in a summer that is being dominated by movies which are full of distasteful humor or are high tech and without a plot. This movie doesn't have any gross humor and it is not high tech, but it could be the best movie of the summer.  If you have the opportunity to see this I highly recommend it.",10,1,2,17 July 1999
