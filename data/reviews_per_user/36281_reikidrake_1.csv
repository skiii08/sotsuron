The Devil's Advocate," An excellent work of two special actors
","The chemistry of the two male lead actors in this show was incredible. The movie line done very well, as the characters were developed with tremendous care. What a couple of actors to put together, Reeves and Paccino. A remarkable work on the vice of vanity. Purely and enjoyment only movie, it is one to sit back relax let it twist your mind around the plot. As we see the plot of good versus evil taking place in the bible belt south, and the avarice life of the north where the two cultures meet, in their diversity and grow together as partners. The main role characters do well on their own, but we must not forget the bible banging mother, the wife who gets bored with success, then the father who ends up being Lucifer himself. Quality acting, and am grateful to have watched it.",10,19,26,23 December 2004
