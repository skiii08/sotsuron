The Lobster," The Lobster's Ecdysis: Great thought, Stupid narrative!
","I want to keep this review simple, unlike this movie, which fails terribly in setting the context.Movie opens with a scene, in which in which a lady gets out of the car and shoots an animal, an ass. This doesn't make any sense in first viewing (What's happening here is that she might be killing a person who has been transformed into an animal) Now, think what a bad-ass opening this film has. Love Revenge!There are two worlds in this cinema, 1. World of Couples 2. World of LonersAnd the Hotel is the society, which lays out the rules and ensures the people follow it.But the problem with this film is that there is no empathy in any form.Be it in acting, dialog, music or color. Nosebleed girl & nosebleed guy pair up Short sight guy & short sight girl pair up This is like a cinematic version of the tech issue, USB type-c compatibility.Why not make a music video instead of a feature length film? Or write a poem and publish the same? Or just paint?'And within a few weeks we could almost talk anything without even opening our mouths'Yes, they said it.",7,2,3,1 January 2017
Into the Wild," Might be a fool's story but a very well told one
","To begin with, it is very difficult to make movies by adapting from books because there will always be a limitation to environment details and also outcome of a decision. Books usually do not conclude any rationals to the actions taken by protagonist. In cinema, director has to decide a direction of motive during post processing.I read a lot of reviews which were negative because they felt character was stupid to have done that. But director is not naive enough to have ignored that fact. Director does a decent effort in presenting the story. That must be appreciated. Regarding how stupid the character was or how much of a life he wasted can be spoken about in a different context. But I felt, as a movie, this was very good. It makes you react, you react to it, maybe in a good way or bad. But this one leaves a lot of questions in mind regarding solitude and relations. Great performance by the actors and wonderful music. And visuals are really good.",8,0,0,14 August 2017
