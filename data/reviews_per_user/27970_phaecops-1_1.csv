Lucky Number Slevin," Movies the way Hollywood used to make them but plot holes.
","Thoroughly enchanting but for one plot hole. If Slevin is trying to be Nick Fischer why is he telling the Rabbi and the Boss that it's mistaken identity? Okay. That's for us, the audience. If he does then we know he's in on the scam. You know, it's the kind of thing that we'll put up with for a great story because we don't think of it until hours later. The only other critique I would venture is that there seem to be far too many flashbacks to explain the setup. If we had known that Slevin was the kid and Goodkat the the 'specialist' assassin. That would have been enough. All told this movie has that edginess that puts it in the league with Pulp Fiction.",8,1,7,25 April 2006
