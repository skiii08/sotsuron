United 93," Shaky camera!
","I understand that directors today feel that a shaky hand-camera makes the viewer feel more 'in the action' and it allows for action to be more frantic. Now, me, personally i like to actually see whats going on in a scene of a movie, and the frantic shaking and close-ups wildly bouncing on the screen is just too much, i left this movie with a headache, and a worse impression than i probably would've had. Others that suffered the shakiness were Batman Begins, The Bourne Supremacy, and the Fast and the Furious. I feel filmmakers are just beginning to get lazy or obsessed with this new fad. What happened to actually watching the action instead of watching a blur.",2,20,42,30 April 2006
