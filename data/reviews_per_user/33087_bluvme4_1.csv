Come and See," Thoughts on the movie.
","This movie was very touching. I was engulfed in emotion while watching it. I enjoyed when the movie went from and objective to subjective view when the bombs were dropping on Florya and Galasha. That moment really made me feel like apart of the movie. I had to keep reminding myself that it was just a movie. The scenes were, not so much graphic but I feel it was the fact that they were so genuinely composed. Watching them struggle through the swamp I wondered why am I watching this but at the same time I could feel all the pain and desperation. I felt that the movie was self referential in its regard to 'killing the children' when Florya stepped on the bird eggs. Its not the same as killing the children so that they don't turn into dangerous people, but maybe to save them from growing up in a world full of bomb, guys, fire and violence. Another thing I noticed was when Florya told Galaha 'I'll save all of you' it wasn't just about Galasha, it was about all the people who needed to be saved.",8,0,0,26 July 2011
