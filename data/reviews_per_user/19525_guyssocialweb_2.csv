Blade Runner 2049," A dystopian dream to rival the original
","I was only 11 years old when the first BR came out in June of 82 and that was a time when every summer you would have a Harrison Ford blockbuster every summer. I have been waiting for this film for a very long time and IMHO... it did not disappoint. Matter of fact I was on the edge of my seat in most of the file. To me BR is about the desire to be God and the want to marvel as he would at the canvas of creation. This is a film to look deep into and pay attention for the clues. They are not that well hidden but fun to piece together into what the story is about. As for the director Denis Villeneuve, this guy has a wonderful eye for visual art. His other movies including Arrival and Prisoner have been a melodic and phycological masterpiece of the mind that leads you to think outside the box. Villeneuve does justice to BR2049 and continues that avant garde feeling by keeping the tone and the awe inspiring dystopian look of the original along with giving it a 30 year in the future nudge to the look. I write this listening to the Han Zimmer soundtrack and I think only him could capture the essence of Vangelis original score. One other thing... I love dystopian movies. Mad Max, Brazil, 1984 just to name a few. But the closest one I hold to my hear that I would never trust a director to remake would be the 1924 Fritz Lang movie Metropolis. That stopped today. I think Denis Villeneuve would be a qualified person to make that movie.",10,3,11,8 October 2017
Captain Marvel," This movie was dry and souless
",I would like to start by saying that DC did a far better job at bringing a female lead into the mordern comic book movie universe. There was no character or heart in Larsons performance. I felt more satisfied by the post credit scenes than the actual movie itself.BTW... Great 90's references. My favorite reference was to Mallrats. And the beginning marvel tribute to the late Stan Lee... Beautifully done.,4,12,23,8 March 2019
