Scarface," Extremely violent '80s crime classic with drugs, sex, etc.
","Viewed today, while Scarface seems less shocking than it did during its initial theatrical run, it's no more substantive or interesting. What were Pacino's detractors hoping for? Something internal and realistic? Low key? The Tony Montana character is above all a performance artist, a man who exists in order to gloriously be himself. The dominant mood of the film is anything but funny. It is bleak and futile: What goes up must always come down. When it comes down in Scarface, the crash is as terrifying as it is vivid and arresting. An unashamed study of selfish, sadistic criminality, and all the better for it. It's a whole new spin on the immigrant story and the American Dream as an underworld nightmare and a fitting bookend to the two Godfather films.",10,1,3,17 September 2013
The Shawshank Redemption," Powerful, poignant, thought-provoking
","Well what can I say but, Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing. Powerful, poignant, thought-provoking and finally irresistibly uplifting. The Shawshank Redemption works not only as an excellent prison drama, but as a metaphor for overcoming our own private prisons.An amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well! I have not read Stephen King's novella (his first non-horror), but some of the movie's deficiencies, such as the old-fashioned morality tale and portentous message about camaraderie and redemption--must have been in the source material.",10,1,1,14 September 2013
