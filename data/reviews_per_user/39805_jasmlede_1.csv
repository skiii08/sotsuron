The New World," Most peaceful movie I have seen
",I watched this movie for my history through film class it's probably boring for people who prefer action movies and things like that. I wouldn't recommend this movie just because I dont know anyone who would wanna see sit through this whole movie there really isn't cliff hangers or anything exciting. The plot of the movie is john smith making peace with Pocahontas tribe so that they'll trade with his men so they could survive and establish a successful colony. While doing so john falls in-love with with the native girl because she saved him from her tribe . John was also teaching Pocahontas English and helping her people to become what he called ''civilized''. Pocahontas dad was the protagonist because he didnt allow john and Pocahontas to happen or be together. You could tell this happened in a different time period because of the cloths they are wearing and the style they are wearing for instance john smith was wearing things you would see in a history book. You could also tell it was a different time period because they were using ships to travel and it was taking them years to get from one place to another. Another thing I noticed was that none people in Pocahontas's spoke English and usually modern day tribes they know how to at least speak some or know the English language. I also noticed that the English men spoke to good of English that it sounded like today's English and not the one back then with the accent. Something else that made me question the historical accuracy was that apparently there is no actual proof that john smith and Pocahontas were involved with each other. So how did they deiced on the scenes they had them together with? How do we actually know what happened. I feel like this is the adult version of the Disney movie they made about this. This is just a little bit more historically accurate and less childish. I liked the setting that they were at it was very very peaceful and pretty. The sounds in it were almost realistic like your there too. I liked that the movie is really well filmed and the pictures and scenes are astonishing. One thing I didn't like about this movie was that it was really boring and dull it had no climax it was a simple story with boring voices. It felt like they were doing everyday things that weren't fun or exciting. I feel like the film and sounds and the pictures saved the movie if it wasn't for the film it would have been a bad movie. The actors were really good I would like to see another movie with the girl who played Pocahontas sadly she hasn't starred in anything else. john smith seems like he might do well in a super hero movie or something like that. Over all I think you should watch it if you enjoy watching things like discovery channel or the history channel even documentaries. I liked it although there was no climax I enjoyed seeing and learning about the things they lived and did in that period of time. It's a very informational movie.,5,0,1,20 September 2018
