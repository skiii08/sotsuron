Alien 3," Superb, grim drama that beat all the odds.
","I love this film. I really, really love this film.Panned as it was for having no guns or violence by the people who probably think Michael Bay is an Oscar winning director, the film shines in so many respects.Alien was a superb and original horror film, Aliens was a great all out action film with a brilliant atmosphere. Alien3 was passed off as a poor mans rip off of the first film when it is in fact an amazing character film.The cast is tremendous featuring an almost entirely vintage British lineup and the delivery of every line is so convincing with Charles Dance taking the biscuit for his amazing Thespien qualities. The sets are grim, industrial and have a character of their own that really makes for a great atmosphere. I've read about the 'Wooden planet' idea and various other script notions that came before but I truly think this was the perfect setting.I'm gushing but even I think that the film is far from perfect. The omission of Newt and Hicks was in very poor taste and served no purpose other than to make the struggle of the events and Aliens utterly pointless. While this does add to the nihilistic feel to the film and coupled with the fact that Carrie Henn would have been a great deal older when this film went into production when it was meant to be set weeks after Aliens it still seemed like a bad move. Also the killing off of such interesting characters like Clemens and Andrews seemed quite a strange decision especially as none of the other characters, good as they were got as much development.All this aside, the biggest kudos has to go to director David Fincher, who through oceans of studio interference and bungling stood what he possibly could of his ground and delivered an amazingly put together and thoroughly enjoyably dark film. I hear many folk slating Fincher for destroying the series but if these morons had bothered to do any research they would know that it was the constant changes and interfering from studio suits, who knew nothing of film making, that really made it suffer. The story is made even better by the Assembly cut which really filled in a lot of the gaps, but even the theatrical release is a fantastic accomplishment in the face of the crap that he had to put up with.If you don't like this then you really don't have the intelligence to.",10,8,9,24 December 2012
Star Trek," Respectful, action packed but classic characters lost in new bland portrayals!
","Films like these are always bold attempts, and particularly hard ones to appease the hoards of drooling fans who expect everything to be perfect down to the slightest detail!Happily the majority of Star Trek wins this fight. The film has a good pace and an interesting if absurd concept but most of all it's good to see the original characters back in action.Back in action is a loose term though because unfortunately the characters are there mostly in name only. I really, really despise it when young actors try to 'bring their own thing' or 'do an original performance' with an already established character. Fine if it is a literary character who is open to many forms of interpretation but for something so iconic and enduring as the original Star Trek cast then tribute must be paid and was lost in a sea of lacklustre personalities. Chris Pines Kirk came off the worst, with the actor portraying a pretty standard action lead with nothing really to distinguish him from so many others. Zachary Quinto gave a suitably dead performance which luckily suited the Vulcan personality but was totally outshone by the Magnificent, if slightly slurry Leanord Nimoy. Ultimate cast Kudos goes to Simon Pegg and Anton Yelchin for they fantastic portrayals of Scotty and Checkov which were done with both energy and familiarity. Karl urban sits firmly in the middle with his accurate but much less passionate portrayal of Bones McCoy.Actors note, to imitate convincingly is as great an acting skill as to deliver a superb original performance. An even balance of the two for films such as this are essential, but was lost in favour of actors trying to 'make their mark', saddened even further by Pine's brilliant second long Shatner impersonation at the end of the film. More of that mixed with what he brought to the role would have been a classic. Kirk is Shatner and vice versa the same as all the Trek characters and this can't be ignored.Effects wise you really can't complain. Lush CGI is abundant everywhere and apart from the Romulan ship being too dark to see most of the time it is still a foreboding and menacing vessel. The same cannot be said of the horribly misused and underdeveloped character of Nero played by the excellent Eric Bana. As a villain he has minimal background, flimsy motivations and zero personality in both look and character to make him stand out. in fact I couldn't really tell which Romulan was the leader most of the time.The altered reality concept of the film should have been a major insult and flimsy excuse for the filmmakers to change things at will, but surprisingly it is not offensive at all and strikes up a curiosity about what is next while preserving the integrity of the original series.In conclusion Star Trek is a decent action sci-fi film with much to offer. But bare in mind, it is solidly directed at those who may have never seen a Star Trek episode or film before, and with a fan base that is arguably the strongest in film & TV history the nods to the original are few and far between and these are the elements that just about every Trekkies will be watching out for first.",Null,0,5,31 July 2011
Alien: Resurrection," Great film.....until the end.
","This film can be summed up in one sentence - 'It's fine until the big white thing appears'.This of course refers to the newborn creature which was created for the film (with zero input from Giger I might add). The lumbering atrocity was one of the worst decisions ever made in this franchise and is there for sheer shock value alone. The makers obviously didn't know how to end the movie and so descended into schlock and gore with this horrible beast as some sort of cheap climax which caters for the lowest common denominator. Absolutely unintelligent and utterly tasteless!The rest of the film however, is great! It's a really good, solid action sci-fi with some memorable characters, and there's some really interesting sections like the clone room, the man who is told he is impregnated, and some new behavioural traits from the Aliens themselves. The film wasted a tremendous opportunity by killing off most of the crew from The Betty. They could have very well taken over the franchise from Ripley, becasue we've had the tragic personal tale already, so an ensemble piece concerning mercenaries hunting down the creatures for profit could have really opened up some doors to interesting stories.That being said, the movie could have been a smashing 90s sci-fi film in its own right if it didn't house the Alien name, but the weight of the franchise brand plus some quite awful decisions drag it down to just 'decent but flawed'.Worth watching for the first hour and a half for sure, but after that it descends into gross out pap.",8,2,4,3 February 2018
The Mummy," True cinematic entertainment!
","The Mummy is without a doubt absolutely everything that embodies the term 'Hollywood'What we have here is a slick, fast paced, funny and action packed film full of mystique and wonder.To start with the film looks amazingly lush with it's golden hue running throughout. Everything is spot on from the lighting to the sets right down to the last dusty detail. The CGI may not be as high resolution as today's standards but it still looks absolutely tremendous and really suits the tone of the film.The plot is a pretty obvious homage to the Indiana Jones series but it not once falls foul of plagiarism and instead takes the idea and expands on it so much as to make it truly it's own film. Fraser is great as the Indy type adventurer and paired with the stunning Rachel Weiss the pair have a great on screen chemistry that's nicely bounced off of John Hannah and Omid Djalili's comic characters.Writer/director Steven Somers manages to give the characters some genuinely snappy and funny dialogue and the action comes in boatloads but is never gruesome, gratuitous or falls back on gore which is actually a very hard thing to do especially in these days of de- sensitivity when everything has to be harsher.I simply can't praise this film enough, it's just pure cinematic entertainment full of thrills, spills, romance and visuals. It's strange that The Mummy actually comes off as a much better film of the genre than Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of The Crystal Skull since the latter series basically created the genre.One of the rare treats to come from a director and team who really believe in what they are doing, and it shows!",10,2,2,2 June 2013
Spider-Man 3," A disappointing end to a fantastic series!
","This film is a classic example of studio interference. After the masterpieces that were the first two films the words 'Too many bad guys and too much forced humour' are painfully apparent.And that is just it, the film has far too many bad guys in it. 3 villains AND a love/heartbreak story is just far too much for any film and so the feel and flow that was so masterfully created in the prequels is lost in sea of underdeveloped new characters and really bad cheesy joke sequences.Admittedly, Sam Raimi does his best with the material and no-one really could have done any better with what was there but ultimately if falls far, far short of the legacy!Personally I would have liked to see Sandman and Sandman alone as the main villain, but the Venom story would have been equally as good.I won't go any further, but just finish on the fact that all the elements were there and done very well, but spread so thinly as to leave you wanting more and much more yet again.A truly disappointing end to a great series, but as suspected the fault lies with meddling executives rather than directors or actors. Take note, let the artists do the art!",Null,0,2,13 August 2011
Captain America: The First Avenger," Marvel quality all round but sits toward the bottom of the pile!
","First off let's make this clear, Marvel doesn't do bad films, it does Excellent films and pretty good films.Captain America falls into the latter category in that it's no Iron Man or Incredible Hulk but it has it's charms and many of them surprisingly humble.Captain America is a creation of Wartime propaganda. Dripping with the kind of phony patriotic pride that unfortunately makes the rest of the world hate the USA so much, so how could this character be translated to film without reaching for your Michael Bay endorsed Stars and stripes sick bag?There are two types of Americans that I have met. One lot is the intelligent, critical thinking, warm, friendly and funny people that make that land great. The other is the small minded 'patriot' that assumes that the USA is superior to every country in the world and any negative remark about her, even in jest is an act of war.It would be so easy for this film to pander to the second group of people with flags flying everywhere, a shot of the Captain killing Hitler and a note at the end saying this film was based on real events.But no, Captain America plays down the 'we are the greatest' card and opts for a smooth, well played and open minded experience. A 1940's English female manages to knock down a US soldier with one punch, this is the sort of humble non defensive attitude that makes the film shine.Evans is great as the Captain. Encompassing that All American boy look with plenty of heart in his performance and enough bravery as to not be OTT but to actually make you believe this man would take a bullet for you in combat!The film looks sumptuous. The photography and CGI are lush and smooth as you'd come to expect from Marvel and the film has more than enough 'boy' style comic book chases, fights and rescues to keep everyone happy although the film does feature an almost identical rip off of the mountain train scene from the Playstation 3 game Uncharted 2: Among Thieves but it's done well although clearly too close to be a coincidence.All this praise comes at a price though for there are flaws. For all the fantastic visuals and solid performances it really comes down to this.....Captain America just isn't a very interesting superhero. He's a slightly enhanced human, a bit faster and a bit stronger than most but still, one gunshot and it's curtains. Perhaps if his skin was updated to be knife or bullet proof (but maybe still hurt like hell when shot or stabbed) it would make him more larger than life but as he is he's an obtainable character, in that if you worked your arse off in the gym you could probably come close to that. I don't like that. I like my superhero's to be super and absurdly fantastic and Captain America is just too ordinary to make anyone go 'WOW!'The boyhood comic scenario's of raid and rescue are woefully out of date although they are handled with great style in the film and Hugo Weaving's Red Skull makeup reeks of Skeletor circa 1987 and it's a shame that more couldn't have been done to it. Weaving's performance, as usual, is excellent and he is a really good bad guy.Overall a genuinely entertaining film with a really likable main character thanks to Evans which intelligently avoids the ''murica' card and was handled with a sense of great style and grace but ultimately loses out on points for just being too everyday a hero.",7,0,0,5 April 2013
Man of Steel," Top marks for concept but zero for a bloated and incoherent execution
","Zack Snyder's re-imagined Superhero farce fails on almost every count and leaves one with a horrible taste in the mouth - like waiting far too long in a greasy restaurant for a meal only to be served a stodgy plate of crap which bloats and causes heaving.The film's concept isn't at fault. All the ideas and the angle which Snyder went for are highly interesting and very fresh, but they are barely touched apon and what we get is nothing short of an incoherent mess which thinks far too much of itself without doing any actual work to have substance. The film's pace and structure is incredibly choppy. Just when something looks to get interesting the film cuts to some dreary flashback or some other drab scene and doesn't give the last one a chance to fully realise itself. This is further hindered by the script which his woefully dull.The cast however, are fantastic. Henry Cavill oozes warmth and his accent is flawless, but he's never given a chance to shine as he chews his way trough the sawdust and water flavoured dialogue while sporting a permanently ruffled brow. In interviews the man is charming and a delight but all of that is lost as Snyder directs him to constantly be moody and depressed with very little explanation as to why. Having him bleat about in a suit which looks like a basketball dipped in oil as well as a horribly washed out colour grading makes the character visually hard to connect with too.The film also has an absolutely unbearable amount of hand-held camera-work which makes it look like some rough £200 indie film, but then suddenly explodes in a mess of non stop Michael Bay style CGI, only nowhere near as good looking. I wanted to like this film so much and after the wonderful trailer (still in my top 3 trailers of all time) I was so excited to see it, but unfortunately the film has none of the optimism or glory of that trailer and we're left with a splat of stuff on screen which is poorly stitched together with no real meat on its bones to buff up the clothes that it's wearing.Top marks for its ideas, but ideas are nothing in a terrible film and in film making terms, this is a terrible film.",1,0,2,23 November 2017
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Good action film but pointless and tasteless re-tread of T2
","Terminator 3, the brave, brave sequel to what is considered by many to be the perfect film, and with that fact alone it was bound to fail. However, was it all bad?The film does indeed have many good points. The special effect and CGI are superb, crisp, and believable with what looks like early Transformers type effects in there. The action scenes can't be faulted, with the now famous crane scene being a pretty stunning set-piece, and every fight and high adrenaline piece is made with every professionalism. The film has had a lot of money thrown at it, and it shows.Casting wise, Nick Stahl turns in a good performance as John Conner and is quite likable in the role. Of course nothing can hide the fact that re-casting a pivotal character causes some pretty major disconnect, and I think had Edward Furlong reprised his role it would have made for a better viewing experience. This is in no way a slight on Stahl's performance, but continuity and familiarity is important when doing a series.Claire Danes is fine, but suffers from nothing to do with her acting skill. Kate Brewster just isn't that much of a character to play, but she does well with what she has and what little time she had to prepare.All this goodness however doesn't take away from the fact that Terminator 3 is really just a copy of it's predecessor. The story follows pretty much an identical plot, and the retreading of key scenes from T2 but done with 'humour' really does sour the experience.However, the biggest flaw surely must be that the film takes the philosophy, effort and loss of the first two films and renders them completely pointless. Everything James Cameron tried to say has been taken back and replaced with a 'Sorry, the first two films were wrong, this is how it is!'The best part of the film is when Skynet becomes self-aware and we are treated to early versions of Terminators and H-K's. However, this is over far too quickly, and you are left with a severe feeling of being had by lazy writers and greedy studios. The 'Rise of the Machines' part does happen, but it's a case of blink and you'll miss it.I don't blame Johnathan Mostow though. This film has studio interference written all over it, and they were obviously pulling the strings. However, if you were a relatively unknown director and someone offered you the chance to get paid a shitload of money to direct a Terminator film you wouldn't turn it down, no matter what these idiot fanboys claim they would do for the purity of the series.A few years ago I would have said this was the worst of the Terminator films, but with the release of the by-the-numbers Genisys I think T3 is a well made and entertaining, but ultimately flawed and predictable entry into the franchise.I always end up watching T3 it when I go on a Terminator binge and it's fine for killing a couple of hours, but given the meddling of the story, the re-casting, and the general lack of originality, I just don't really count it as canon.The James Cameron directed 'T2: Battle Across Time' from 1996 is the closest thing you'll get to a proper sequel. Not only does it reunite the original T2 cast, but seeing the Terminator and John Connor go FORWARD in time to Terminate Skynet (essentially turning the idea of the first films on it's head) would have made a great film in it's own right.",5,0,2,2 January 2013
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Unfunny and annoying! Truly a film for the now generation!
","Being quite the fan of director Edgar Wright's previous efforts and being a self confessed gaming nut since 1981 and seeing the rise of the Nintendo generation from the beginning who supposedly this film is directed at. I was really excited and looking forward to spotting all the gaming references that Wright likes to sneak into his films and shows.It turns out this film is the most shocking example of what passes for entertainment these days. It was terrible, unfunny and extremely annoying.The film is absolutely tailor made for a generation that has an attention span of about 0.2 seconds. The characters all talk in a similar quickfire style with a camera cut happening almost every half second and the screen is littered with bright coloured, animated fx obviously there to stimulate whatever moronic mind would find this fun. The characters are horribly accurate examples of today culture with protagonist Scott Pilgrim himself being the archetypal anti hero. Weedy, weak, unsure of himself and sensitive along with the token gay friend and 'rocker' girlfriend.This is a nerds wet dream. It places a weakling in a world where game rules apply and said weakling proceeds to annihilate 7 rather more burly boyfriends of the pretty girl he is trying to woo. It's what every nerd, outcast and skinny emo boy in the world wishes would happen to them.I'm insulted that this film wants to the the hero for gamers of the world. I am a massive gamer and absolutely nothing about this film appealed to me at all.Now to be fair I must give kudos to the visual effects in the film. They are both stylish and impressive and the actual fight choreography itself is excellent. To those that think that this is enough to make a film good, even a comic book action film, must have something seriously wrong with them.Do yourself a favour, walk out after the 8-bit Universal logo. It's by far the best part of the film!",1,99,233,1 November 2010
Independence Day," Perfect entertainment!
","This film is without a doubt the epitome of the summer blockbuster!It's perfectly paced, has good solid and charismatic characters, VFX which were great for the time and still decent now, and a perfect sense of scale, foreboding, excitement, and comedy.It won't win any Oscars for writing or deep layered performances, but it's one of the most entertaining films you'll ever see, and that alone makes it's value far greater than the oceans of snobby arthouse dramas out there that the elitists love to tug off to.Grab a few beers on a Sunday afternoon and stick this film on. It's custom made for a good time!",10,1,1,4 October 2019
Alien vs. Predator," Good, solid action sci-fi.
","It's so easy to jump on a bandwagon when your a sheep, and that's exactly what happened to this movie. AvP is a solid action sci-fi film, and there' just no getting away from that. To start with, it looks great! Director Paul W.S. Anderson (the man who gave us the ONLY good video game film ever in Mortal Kombat) has a remarkable eye for visuals, and here is no exception. It's a pretty film with decent CGI and some really stunning set design.The story is interesting as well, and to address the elephant in the room, yes the first third of this film is pretty much Identical to the start of Prometheus, only AvP got there first by nearly a decade. When things kick off the action is fantastic and it's just a well made and fun film all round, plus it's GREAT to see Lance Herikson back, and he does afar better job as a Weyland than Guy Pearce.Is it perfect? No. It's not as good as any of the first three Alien films not is it as good as the first two Predator films. There's a real lack of character development and most people there are just meat sacks waiting to be killed. Some questionable representation of the gestation cycle of the Aliens is on show here and having the lead teaming up with a predator was just a bad idea. Another fault is that, even though the action is fantastic there's just not enough of it.Still, these minor quibbles aside I found AvP to be a great and fun action sci-fi film, with plenty of thrills, spills and monster madness. Infinitely better than the atrocious sequel which followed.Don't listen to the sheep. Something being 'not as good as...' doesn't automatically = 'Bad'.",8,3,4,4 February 2018
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Highly enjoyable film but the adventure stays in the book
","Having freshly watch this film in the comfort of my own home (I missed the cinema viewing) I have to be very honest.....I really liked it!Much better paced than the first instalment and some really great performances all round.Sadly again the film bears little resemblance to the wonderful book on which it was based. I honestly didn't recognise most of it bar the barrel scene and a few others which is a shame because the action overtakes what was supposed to be an adventure.In saying that though, the film rips along and there is plenty to keep the attention.The horrible dwarven makeup is much less apparent this time around and this adds heavily to the feel, although some of the dwarfs still look far too 'man' like for me and the CGI is once again over used but to better effect this time around depicting towns and views.As much as I love the character, the crowbarring in of Legolas was more of a distraction than a welcome addition. Besides his completely unbelievable OTT combat skills his personality is completely different than what we know. People change yes but there is no trace of the cool skilled and warm elf that we know. Instead we get a moody, angry pain in the bum and while that is OK it would have been better served with a new and different face and character.Going back to a positive note, special mention must go to Benedict Cumberbatch and Smaug, for the performance here is truly fantastic as is the CGI dragon itself. I felt sorry for Martin freeman though as he is meant to be the main character but hardly has any screen time at all. What he has though is excellent, I just wish there was more of it.All in all it's a vast improvement over the first film but still not as good as any of the LOTR films.It's a shame that the book on which it is based is barely recognisable in amongst all the made up filler but then again I thought the filler was pretty good. Being a sucker for a good love story the inter racial romance was quite enjoyable and there was plenty of nice lush things to look at and move the story along.It's definitely apparent that we are not getting an adaptation of the book from this series at all. Why beggars belief as accuracy to source material in the comic, fantasy and sci-fi worlds are of utmost paramount and this is something that we all thought Peter Jackson knew and understood as he could have easily done the book accurately and well without almost completely re-writing it.As a film though the Hobbit:DoS is a highly enjoyable adventure film with some rich characters and nice lore and is a very welcome addition in my collection, but if I ever want to properly visit the world and adventure that Tolkien wrote about then I'll have to read the book, for there it stays and it doesn't look like it will ever leave.",8,0,1,28 April 2014
Batman Begins," Solid & well played but over long and lacking style!
","Batman Begins had to be one of the most highly anticipated movie reboots even. After the farce that was the Schumacher sequels to the glorious Burton films it had to be good.And it was.......and wasn't!I think I may be the only person on the planet who doesn't see Christopher Nolan as the new film messiah and his Batman films are riddled with, not flaws because there is noting wrong with them but just things that don't quite fit!I'm writing this review to encompass all 3 Nolan Batman films because they pretty much come as one package so no sense in writing a review for each that would be identical.Good news is that Nolan is no hack, his attention to detail is second to none and the accuracy to the source material which was missing in previous adaptations is more than present in is films to appease any comic book whiner.This is where it ends for me. The films incorporate all the essential ingredients of Batman but it comes away leaving me feeling a bit cold. The casting is a bit off in places. Bale shines as Bruce Wayne in probably the best performance of that character but his Batman seems forced, cheesy and uncomfortable. Support Comes from some great names but this has backfired. Michael Caine is superb as always but throughout the trilogy I always felt I was watching Michael Caine play Alfred and not Alfred himself. Gary Oldman is much more convincing and plays Gordon almost perfectly.The biggest problem is that it just doesn't have any style to suggest it is a Batman film. Batman Begins had a nice look to a bronze tinted Gotham complete with monorail and some interesting dark architecture. The sequels unfortunately paint Gotham as a bland faceless city. The flyover shots could be stock footage from any urban 'metropolis' in the world. The fight scenes are dreadfully shot with quick cuts and close up camera work that is reminiscent of bygone techniques before hong kong set a new standard. This brawling method of shooting works well for a Pre-Batman Bruce Wayne in the first film but after you expect something much sharper and stylish to the combat. The faceless style overflows into the dramatic scenes as well. If you were to turn on the telly and see one of the scenes between non masked characters you would have a hard time telling it is a Batman film.With that lies the greatest flaw of all. Nolan takes a comic book character and puts him way too far into the real world. The films play out like a dramatic crime thriller. po faced, over serious and...possibly Nolan's biggest flaw, always over long. The films run an average of 2.5 hours each and time is dragged out on too much talking and very little Batman especially in the third instalment where we barely get 20 minutes of caped action. (A complaint directed at Burton for Batman Returns)In transferring Batman to the reality of our world Nolan sacrificed some of the fantastic and wonder that makes comic book characters desirable. Batman get's away with it because of his source material but has lost some of the awe that was in the comics.The greatest asset to this series is something Nolan got right and is the cornerstone of any comic.The Villains!Every one played beautifully and steals the show. Ledger as the Joker is wonderfully deranged, adding just a sprinkle of past performances into his own manic mix even though his makeup strayed a bit too far from the source for comfort. Hardy cannot be topped at Bane. A sumptuous vocal performance with a commanding physical presence, he makes almost every line quotable.Cillian Murphy has always been a great actor in my eyes and he does not disappoint here although I do feel he was not given anywhere near enough screen time as Scarecrow and that will always be a grim point.Still worth all your money in DVD and Blu-ray sales though!",1,3,5,4 April 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Highly enjoyable fantasy adventure with glaring cosmetic flaws and inaccuracies to source
","Having just watched this film again since seeing it on it's cinematic release I felt my opinion of it solidify.Let's get it out of the way, it's not as good as any of the Lord Of The Rings Films, nor is it a particularly faithful adaptation of the wonderful book which I read as a child but as a fantasy film it's fairly decent.The acting is all top notch and the new dwarven music is superb and has a really enchanting melody. The film doesn't move super fast but it's OK and keeps the attention fine.Now to the flaws, of which there are a few and they mainly reside in the cosmetics.For a start the film relies far too much on CGI. This is fine for grand settings and adding in the odd ruin here and there on a bare hilltop but not for actual characters. In LOTR, the orcs were men in suits and makeup and looked tangible, gritty and real. Almost all the goblins and such are computer generated and unfortunately it shows. All this,combined with some rather bizarre colour schemes, very much gives the film a Phantom menace/Time Burton's Alice In Wonderland feel and that is never a good thing.Secondly the dwarven makeup is absolutely terrible. They honestly look like they are from a budget pantomime and not a massive fantasy film. To reference LOTR again, the dwarfs were tough and gruff with no frills and not much colour. Here they look like they have stepped straight out of Ridely Scott's Legend (A great film but not what we want here!).Admittedly in the cinema the 48fps really made the make up obvious and in the home it's lessened some but the braided beards and obviously fake noses really kill the feel. Another issue is that some of the dwarfs don't even look like dwarfs, they look more like men and some are even quite pretty.These flaws do nothing to capture the feel set in either the book, the LOTR films or fantasy in general and it's a shame that issues so cheap looking were allowed to slip through the net.Cosmetics aside the film is highly enjoyable and it is a nice film to have as an addition if you are on a LOTR binge.I'd have to give this film 2 ratings for sake of source respect.As a film adaptation of a beautiful children's book, it's about a 3 or 4 out of 10 I'm afraid.As a fantasy film and expansion of a known universe in film it's a solid 7. Highly watchable and enjoyable adventure with only some glaring cosmetic flaws letting it down.",7,0,1,28 April 2014
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A good film but ending on another downer is just too much
","The Last Jedi is certainly an improvement over the shallow Force Awakens. It's a far more textured affair all round and there is plenty here to get lost in. The effects are stunning plus the surprises are many and unexpected which makes for a good viewing experience.The film does have flaws though - the 'jokes' are pretty much ALL ill timed and fall flat on their asses. More than that they actually detract from the moment in which they were used, not least of all in the opening sequence.The side story for Finn and Rose offers a clumsy moral message which takes up far too much screen time and could have been edited down to just a few scenes. Daisy Ridley is surprisingly stale and wooden in this episode, a far cry from the expressive and dynamic performance she game in TFA but the rest of the new cast do just fine.By far the biggest flaw is Disney's seeming obsession to do away with all of the old characters via on screen deaths. The Force Awakens was pretty much ruined for me by Killing off Han Solo....not for the fact he died, but the really poor timing of it. For a film that was trying to introduce new characters, new plots and catch up on 30 years of lore it was just TOO much to take seeing a beloved character die as well as all the other baggage. The Last Jedi does the same and ends again with us losing another beloved character (for no apparent reason either). To have not one, but two films in the new trilogy end on downers is too much to take and the negative association will affect repeat viewings. I don't think it would have been too much to ask to have a happy ending for a change but Disney seem hell bent on burying the past for good in rather shoddy graves.Regardless, the film is incredibly well made and really feels like a Star Wars movie, so if you can get past the ropy writing, bad jokes and seeing more people you love die then it really is worth a watch.",7,0,4,16 December 2017
From Dusk Till Dawn," A script and character triumph unashamedly wrapped in glorious nonsense.
","When this film came out all I remember is that it was 'the' go to film for all things cool.The plot wasn't a surprise as the trailers pretty much gave everything away but the decade was still buzzing from Tarantino fever and after the superb 'Desperado' the teaming of Robert Rodriguez and his screen writing chum doing a film about vampires was too much pull for a 17 year old me.I can say without a doubt that it is a classic. Maybe not in the sense of Casablanca or Raiders Of The Lost Ark but as a style film it really can't be touched. Tarantino's screenplay drips with wit and humour as well as the usual taboo subjects thrown into everyday conversation and Rodriguez direction compliments this. Both men have made 'looking tacky' an art form when it comes to film and this heavily works in it's favour because we want it to feel sleazy and a bit dirty. Rodriguez has made some right stinkers in his time but in this era he was what I consider to be a proper fimmaker with no CGI and not much of a budget which pushes directors to be as creative as possible.The cast is about as good as it gets. George Cloony, who audiences were used to seeing as a respectable Doctor on the hit Series ER does a complete character 180 into the superb Seth Gecko a character with all the moral fibre of a rock and the patience of a 5 year old. He tears into the script like a hungry dog which showcases whole new side to Cloony's acting and who could forget 'that' tattoo, a tiny detail which really brought the visual impact of the character to life and has since been copied many times but back then it was a striking feature. It's probably safe to say that this film was a game changer for Cloony who gained new respect for such a radical change but sadly hasn't really done much else that comes close.As a few people have mentioned this is really two films in one, the first being a superb crime drama which sees the Gecko boys escape over the border with a kidnapped family, and the second is pure schlock nonsense and I am totally fine with that.Maybe it was the teenager in me when I saw this but nothing could make me or my pals smile more than a bit of blood, guts and vampires interlaced with ridiculous humour. Some say the vampire section brings the crime thriller down but I think the thriller part raises the profile of what is already a really cool film.So many people go by formulas, right ways to do things and rules. Where art is concerned and this includes film, music etc. there can only be guidelines and it's great to see a bunch of people making a film the way they want to make it and that means throwing whatever off beat, off topic nonsense they feel like into the mix just because they simply think it would be cool.A superb and sleazy trashcan of a movie that's not afraid to play with childish notions because it knows it's a cut above most film snobs polished favourites.",9,1,2,7 June 2013
The Mummy Returns," More of the same but the same great quality
","The sequel to the fantastic adventure that was The Mummy was always going to be a tough job. Thankfully the same cast and crew are reunited with writer/director Steven Somers taking the helm once again.The good thing about this movie is that it doesn't try to top the original but what it does do is offer up more of the same. Same feel, same look, same humour and it all works nicely to bring a sequel that will keep you entertained for an hour or two.It has to be said it's not 'quite' as good as the original. The story takes a strange turn in giving the characters some sort of mystical heritage which is a little odd but works nonetheless. The CGI is the usual standard for a film of this type but again I don't think it is quite as good as the first film.All this is just nitpicking as the plot and story race along very well and all the actors do their parts and look like they are having fun especially the young O'Connell Alex who is a nice addition to the cast.Nothing more can really be said, if you like me loved the first Mummy film then do not hesitate to watch this as it is simply an extension of the quality and will satisfactorily fill your 'more of the same' urge.",9,1,1,2 June 2013
Avatar," Stock sci-fi farce. Decent enough, but doesn't need or deserve 4 sequels.
","Avatar claims to be the revolution in VFX and movie storytelling, and given the pedigree of its director you wouldn't be blamed for thinking it's true.Unfortunately the film is a rather by-the-numbers sci-fi romp with a thin moral message clumsily woven throughout. The CGI is very nice, but even back in 2009 it didn't really seem THAT impressive, and now it just looks quite stock.James Cameron has always liked his technology and that's fine, but he seems to use films more as tech demos as the years go on, and it's got to a point where the Avatar obsession is getting ridiculous.Cameron is planning multiple sequels to this film, but quite honestly it barely even deserves one let alone the four he has in mind.It's a decent way to kill a couple of hours, and it can be fun spotting vehicle designs that are similar to stuff in Aliens and The Terminator, but unfortunately that's the extent of its quality.",6,0,2,1 June 2019
Total Recall," A ground breaking classic!
","This film is up there as one of the all time greatest action films and for good reason. Blending slick action, futuristic settings and ultra violence into, in my opinion, the best Arnie film to date bar Terminator 2.Appearing at the tail end of the 80's and early 90's it managed to capture the balls out 'Yeah!' of the 80's action film while blending it with slick sci-fi special effects. Total Recall and Predator 2 are prime examples of a dying art going out with a bang before being taken over by CGI rubbish.Paul Verhoeven directs in his own unique 'Robocopish' way, making the settings seem both hi tech and tacky at the same time. This film was tailor made for Schwarzenegger (Hardly surprising as it was him who convinced the producers to buy the rights for him!) and you couldn't imagine anyone else in the role, yet Arnies trademark one liners are kept to a tasteful minimum which amplifies their impact and for a man who is known for his fantastic physique he spends all but one small scene of the film completely covered up in clothes that wouldn't look out of place today never mind the future.The combination of violence, smooth hi tech Special effects, which were ground breaking at the time and gross out body horror make this film absolutely irresistible for fans of action, sci-fi and sfx buffs.A ground breaking classic and no mistake. Whoever greenlighted the remake of this priceless gem are the reason that people are using the Pirate Bay to download films instead of paying overblown cinema prices for such unoriginal, money grabbing half hearted raping of vintage movies and should be shot.",10,0,2,24 October 2010
Joker," Not a masterpiece, but a very good film
","Joker is an excellent character study of a man who is descending into a dark madness. It's central theme of how society treats the mentally ill is very strong and well done, and full props must be given to Joaquin Phoenix for his excellent performance.It's not a perfect film though. It borrows heavily from other sources, and the themes go deep, but not as deep as they maybe could have. Also, the Joker character at the end didn't quite feel right as the movie never took him past angry personal revenge killings to become the outright and indiscriminate psychopath that he is supposed to be.If you only watch comic book films then this will seem truly mind blowing, but for seasoned cinephiles, it's been done better in other movies. Still, that doesn't take away from what is maybe not a masterpiece, but a very good film - and there's nothing wrong with being a very good film.",8,4,8,7 October 2019
Hancock," Good, solid and funny film but tries to be too many things at once.
","Hancock is an interesting film, this much has to be said.The concept of taking a Superman style hero, powers and all and making him a low life, bungling alcoholic has to be one of the most original ever to cross a studio executive's desk.The film scores well on so many points but you just feel that something was missed.Hancock drifts between superhero movie, comedy and drama and thus spreads itself a little too thin to be good at any. The comedy is stunted by the all too serious tones and the lack of any real villain is a major downside because what it gets right and what we are treated to most of is the superhero side and no baddie equals why bother?Bad points aside though this is a good film. The special effects are top notch and we are treated to some great flying effects and fight scenes. The humour is snappy and spot on with some great delivery by Smith although it is just a bit too sparce and I feel more could have been put in to the script without the danger of it becoming comedy farce.I can see what the director is trying to do with the drama and it works with the subject matter but to tackle such deep psychological subjects of a superhero you really need something epic and fleshed out and as stated before, it's too much of a lot of things at once and never gets to a climax with any of them.A special mention has to go to the soundtrack. The selection of moody down and out blues mixed with some well placed funk and rap songs at appropriate moments really lifts the character and emphasises the fact that this is a much needed black superhero in a world of lilly white comic book crimefighters.Hancock is worth checking out, indeed if like me you are a fan of such superheros (Personally I like any film where someone has the ability to fly) but the film does seem to blow it's load in the first half an hour and descends into more grim territory later on.It would certainly be worthy of a more fleshed out sequel because when an idea is this good it would be a shame to let it die!",8,2,3,7 April 2013
Live Free or Die Hard," Fast, slick and entertaining to the last minute!
","I'm sure like most people at the time I was highly dubious about Hollywood bringing back such a beloved franchise after such a long time. Films like Die Hard usually lose their quality and imagination past a trilogy in favour of money making trash with a big name attached. How utterly delighted when on viewing the film this was the farthest thing from the case.Die Hard 4.0 is an enthralling, rip-roaring adventure which is dripping with style and keeps you really gripped to the action.Bruce Willis returns to the role of John McClane effortlessly and this time he's thrown in to the unfamiliar territory of cyber terrorism.Visually it's great, a lot of time has been spent on beautifully moody lighting and some really great set pieces. The story, at least for a geek like me is a fascinating one and never lets up with plenty of motivation to keep the characters moving along. I have however, a sneaking suspicion that this was written as an original stand alone film that the producers tacked the Die Hard name on to and wrote in the McClane character. True or not it certainly doesn't hurt either side of the equation. Although it's very much a computer driven storyline Willis get's more than enough screen time with plenty of fights and brilliant one liners straight from the gung-ho era.A lot of people complained about this film being a PG-13 and to that I say get over yourself. If you need an R or an 18 rating stamped onto a film to judge it's quality then you are no more than a film hipster. I honestly didn't notice the lack of profanity in the film (Something which I think is effective but completely unnecessary if you have a good story) and everything works just fine and the action is tremendous.I feel many people will overlook this film because of some snobbery but honestly, do check it out. You won't find a slicker, well written and more action packed and entertaining film for probably a long time!",9,2,4,15 June 2013
Her," Crazy good!
","It's a shame I had to discover 'Her' from a YouTube film list named 'Best hipster films' as it's so much more than that.'Her' blew me away with it's fantastic take on the classic love story. The performances are amazing and Jonze absolutely nailed the situations that relationships have with the dialogue but with the added spice of one person being an A.I. and one a human. There are moments of joy and moments of pure sadness and pain, all of which I felt through Theodore. There are also some wonderfully and intentional awkward parts to the film yet the semi-futuristic world that this is set in seems relatively open to these A.I./human relationships which is in itself refreshing and optimistic yet at the same time quite cringey.Scarlett Johanssen stole the show for me as the voice of Samantha. The nuance and emotion in her voice, the playfulness, the sadness, the innocence was delivered perfectly and was totally captivating for someone that isn't actually seen. She was made a real character and one that you could almost believe you could fall in love with.It's a shame that this movie will get relegated to the wanky art film section by the majority of the public, probably due to it's visual style but take a leap and enjoy one of the finest films for years.",9,0,1,14 December 2016
