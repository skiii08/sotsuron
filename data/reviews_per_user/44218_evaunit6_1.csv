The Ring," All in all not bad, but...
","Having just seen 'The Ring,' I will say it definitely was creepy.  Lots of nice, disturbing visuals accompanied by a shrill noises and sudden bursts of sound...Only problem was after leaving the theater I knew I'd been cheated. All throughout the film there is an impending sense that we're obviously being led somewhere, hopefully to the mystery behind the tape on which the story revolves around.  Unfortunately, it seems the film makers have taken the easy route and left out any explanation whatsoever for anything that occurs in the film.  My guess is that we're being set up for 'The Ring 2.' All I know is throughout the climax of the movie all I could think was, 'Now, why am I supposed to be scared by this?' Oh, and I figured out what 'The Ring' was the first time we get to see the tape for ourselves...that probably didn't help to heighten the suspense.  If you want my opinion, see 'Signs' instead...",6,0,0,19 October 2002
