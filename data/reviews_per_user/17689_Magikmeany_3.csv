It," Superb Horror
","So many negative reviews which I find ridiculous!!
Highly entertaining & better than the original.
Cost $35m to make and returned $700m so those ridiculously low reviews must come from another planet?
Can't wait for the next one.",10,0,1,22 June 2019
Big Hero 6," Spectacular!!
","So so well made and as for the animation probably the best I have ever seen. The film just grabs you and draws you in visually and emotionally. The Sanfransokyo setting is a really clever concept as is the remodelling of the Golden Gate Bridge and the whole city. The whole setting is superb and must have taken a lot of research and animating to achieve the spectacular setting. As for Baymax the inflatable side kick to Hiro, this is an absolutely perfect piece of writing and the imagination of the writers on this one is so inspired. The eclectic array of nerds with their individual talents makes the film and storyline the better. Perfect, stunning and brilliant - I would like to see a sequel?",10,2,4,26 December 2015
Pulp Fiction," Again & Again I Adore this film
","Rather than dwell on any bad points - are their any? I must have watched & tremendously enjoyed this film 6x in the last year!! and probably the equivalent every year since it was released.Tarantino's mark on all his films is evident - and yes it's obvious he's using his childhood experience or dreams? in his fantastic ability to make stunning films.& to top it off the 360 filming of this piece is a pleasure to behold? Never ever get bored of the quality this artist delivers, nor do my 16 & 18 year old sons.One of the best Directors & Writers ever!",10,1,3,11 April 2013
