3:10 to Yuma," Friggin stupid movie filled with flaws
","My faith in IMDb was terribly shaken when I saw the 8.2 point on this movie and went to see it. The movie did not deserve even a 6. Please read on to save ur money, Don't watch this movie. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Spoilers~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Being a fan of Russel and most of his movies, I was instantly motivated to see this movie as soon as I saw the preview. However I was terribly mislead into thinking this was gonna be good. I do not wish to discuss in depth the details of the movie but will instead point out why it was very very disappointing for me. 1. The leading role is a totally useless guy who did shoot especially well. His relationship with Russel crow was very strange in that they were supposed to be enemies but I see them helping each other out all the time when they were supposed to hate each other's guts. 2. Russel's crew came all the way to save him only to be shot dead by him in the end, and just stood there getting shot without even trying to duck-->Not logical. 3. Russel's character was very conflicted in that he did not try to run over overpower the main character in the end but fascilited his trip to the train.-->Very strange thing to do for someone who wound get hanged when he got on that train. Hell he even climbed in after killing all his crew. 4. I did not get the point of this movie as the story was filled with things that are just not logical and u don't see in real life and thus cannot move me. 5. Russel's crew were all gathered on the street right below the window where he was held last. The good guys coulda shot at least 4-5 of them from the window and thus win if they tried, but no~ they instead voted to walk out and get shot...that's friggin stupid...I been reading IMDb for years now and this is the only movie I really felt commenting on as the rating was way too high or that I don't understand US culture as well as I might have imagined.",6,3,7,10 October 2007
