Sucker Punch," Not bad but
","Recently I re-watched Sucker punch and finally wound up not having a problem with the movie. Though at times the actions scenes over excite the actual intentions of the movie.So here it goes-------- First scene: In the first scene I realized the full intentions were about an abused daughter (Baby doll), sent to an mental house after evil deeds of the father. Later we see revenge is place upon the evil but was failed. Second scene: she gets sent to the mental house where we find its a front then the adventure begins with her three days that she has left. That is before she gets her lobotomized. Third scene: They finally see an opening to leave but because baby doll is the key to end all wrong doings.She suffers the consequences as she finally becomes lobotomized, but authority steps in and stops all this then closes the place with illegal activities that occurs. There is no problem with the thought that Zack imagined to make the film work, just that reality and imagination gets clouded at times making the movie hard to enjoy. Though I do see how He uses mental flotations to make action segments with the satisfaction of Baby doll getting justice. The action is well played out but at times it just wasn't well thought out.",Null,1,4,12 September 2011
The Expendables 2," Totally Unnecessary
",When I first heard that they were following up the Expandible film from the previous one I was excited hoping for that cinematic experience that succeeded the previous film. After looking at the trailer I had my doubts and from there I really was furious. Firstly I would like to point out that it is a very good idea to have the classic action genre that we all well know. From the likes of Chuck Norris and Jean Claude Van Dam including Stallone. But really do we have to go through this again? I mean the classic action sequences we all love from the 80s and 90s should have been kept the way they were which belongs as straight to DVD. Sorry first one was good and may pass as something presentable but the second get serious. Overall I already look past the point that it is a fun film but do we have to endure the under rated succession that burnt out long ago.,4,15,114,15 August 2012
The Bourne Legacy," A Trilogy that should be shelved
","So Bourne is reborn one more time wow and this time we have Jeremy Renner instead of Matt Damon. As the previous three films were a great success and I would re-watch them again from the beginning except for the fourth one. Here's the reason why I find that rebooting this series is a big mistake. A film this big must have Matt and an excellent script which it wasn't. Instead we have an almost great story that is lacking of plot and pointless direction. Being that I watched the last three previous ones this completely does not add up to the hype from the past. Looking forward it would be great if they really dial back and rethink what they could do better on this film. It is sad that what once what was a great film turned to complete garbage. Overall I would watch it for pointless action and the crazy scene in Manila, with the motor bike down the rails. Other than that I would just simply fall asleep.",5,1,7,15 August 2012
