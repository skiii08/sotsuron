Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's awesome!
","Like 'The Empire Strikes Back,' it gets off to a bit of a slow start, but after the pod race, everything is great!  The light saber battles are fantastic!  Excellent use of foreshadowing.  I thought there were were some unnecessary special effects scenes (the underwater journey) and a little too much 'Jar-Jar' but other than that, I have no criticisms.Qui-Gon is a prototypical Jedi, at peace, and confident.  He spends his words and energy wisely.  Obi-Wan does not have as much screen time as I might have thought he would, but he is only an apprentice after all, and lets Qui-Gon make the decisions.  We'll see a lot more of Obi-Wan in the next 2 movies.  Jar Jar is pretty annoying, but the real world is filled with people like this.  He's not as bad as some people say.  Amidala and Padme: what can I say?  Really good acting, very strong characters. Anakin is a 9 year-old boy with obviously mixed emotions, I did not see any 'acting' problems.  Palpatine gives me the creeps, since we all suspect/know what he will become.  Darth Maul (wow!) has got moves and talent beyond belief. He is intense and (dare-I-say-it?) -- 'menacing.'Any critic who saw this movie and gave it less than 3 1/2 stars must have been blindfolded. This movie has been over-analyzed -- its a lot easier to just sit down and enjoy it.",7,0,0,26 May 1999
Ender's Game," Very well done!
","Very well done! It was interesting to feel the weight of the outcome upon the characters during the movie, since I knew what was going to happen.For me this was similar to finally seeing Lord of the Rings on screen several years ago - great to see this story unfold visually after so much personal imagining.The Ender actor was nuanced and faithful to the expectations of the novel. Harrison Ford turned in a nice performance - love his voice and smirk! Sometimes the movie seemed to move a little fast - there was a lot of 'plot' to fit into two hours. I consider that to be a minor flaw.",10,2,9,1 November 2013
