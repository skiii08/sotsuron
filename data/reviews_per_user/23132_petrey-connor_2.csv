Iron Man 3," IRON MAN 3 is the BEST Superhero film.
","It's a first day buy on Bluray no don't! There's no doubt you will enjoy this film. The direction is well perfection. It has far too many cool action scenes and dialogue that it can not fail. The trailers don't show you a thing from the film besides the house scene. But when you think something is the way it truly is then you are wrong. It is a great film that I will be paying $25 dollars for. The film provides many references towards the avengers and at one point there is a cameo by the one and only Joss Whedon, the director of The Avengers. List of Superhero films in my favor. Top five....there not only MArvel films. 1. Iron Man 3 2. The Avengers 3. The Amazing Spiderman 4. The Dark Knight 5. V for Vendetta",10,26,41,4 May 2013
Evil Dead," Besides Star Trek(2008) this has go to be the BEST reboot
","I was very skeptical going into it but when I walked out I was pleasantly surprised. Extremely happy with this film, I left with a smile on my face and the thought of how much this one is up with the original. Every little piece of gore in this was well used. It was cringe worthy and thats what I loved about it. What can I say I think that this film had purpose and that was to give the viewer a fun time. It did that completely for me, NO DOUBT. I see peopled complaining about it and how Sam Raimi would be so disappointed in the making of this film but he was one of the head writers of this film along as a consulting producer and so was Bruce Campbell. WAIT Till the END because the ONE and ONLY ASH shows up but don't get your hopes up. A thing to get excited about is when EVIL DEAD 2 arrives, ARMY OF DARKNESS 2 arrives as well. So HELL YEAH!!!!",10,10,27,4 May 2013
