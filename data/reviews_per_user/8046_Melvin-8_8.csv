Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," George Lucas gives us a rollercoaster ride we surely won´t forget!
","Well, it´s not 'Empire Strikes Back' but it still is one famous piece of film. From the beginning to the astounding ending 'Phantom' gives you joy, laughter and excitement that makes you beg for more.",10,0,0,20 June 1999
The English Patient," An Hommagé to the old fashioned movies!
",It´s a good movie although there are hundreds and hundreds of things stolen from other movies.So my rating for this one is:6/10,6,0,4,4 July 1999
Malcolm X," Gangster finds his path to god!
",A great work from Spike Lee!He portrayed Malcolm really as a spirited leader. Also to mention: this is one out of few movies not blaming the Islam but trying to explain itÂ´s origins .,10,2,7,28 July 1999
Armageddon," A rollercoaster ride of emotions!
","Armageddon is one of the greatest achievement in 90´s Filmaking! It features: fun, love, action and the most important fact: HONOR! Another positive thing to tell about it is that it tells us that all people, religions and races should unite as a one real Mankind worth fighting for.",10,1,1,1 July 1999
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," phew.......i don't know where to begin....
","First of all I'd like to say that Terminator 3 really is a good movie but it is lacking size T2 had(in aspects of Acting, Violence and Execution). There are SPOILERS following in this text so don't read it in case you haven't seen the flick!It's far better made than T1(no wonder...)and also has a better storyline, etc. but the Terminator-Feeling just didn't come up.Arnie is far too tame. He wasn't as menacing.............. The R-Rating also is a joke. I mean part one was very violent,part 2 toned down the violence(there were short and effective bursts of violence), part 3 only got the R because of the infamous 'killing the detective' scene and for the nudity. Arnie was not responsible for any of the movie's violence. At least the could have had him kneecapping some people in this one.....But hey............It's just me (an old arnie fan) who wants the Oak to kick some ass..........I guess so or else the movie would have had a much harder edge.",10,1,2,15 July 2003
The Patriot," Mel Gibson does it again!(kicks british arse)
","The movie actually was very good. It had humor, action and outstanding acting. Mel Gibson plays his role with a lot of dedication and honesty. Jason Isaacs plays a great villain. The story was great and had everything a good War Movie needs. Saving Private Ryan  has a simple storyline but was compared to masterpieces like Apocalypse Now to name one. Now to the brits and their hurt feelings: It is a fact that the british were a sadistic and violent entity on this planet. Murdering thousands of people only to maintain their force. That's a fact. In Saving Private Ryan all germans were depicted as violent and gruesome.Don't get me wrong the Nazis were scum and belong to hell but when it comes to quantity the british killed more than the germans ever did. But this has been forgotten by historians. They look back in time for about 60 years(2nd World War) but when you look back in history of violence about 1500 years before our time you would see that the world biggest murderer were the british. The germans are not the only ones to be ashamed. Be honest to yourselves and be ashamed too, britains.",10,0,2,5 August 2000
Independence Day," Oh my God!!!
","What a piece of sh*t is this?In the beginning it looks like a cool popcorn-flick but it end to a catastrophe. Ok, I accept the patriotism of american citizens but this was over the top. Does Emmerich really think that we as an audience are just brainless? Here are some examples which prove me right: - a drunk Nam-Vet destroys the UFO over Area 51 although he´s never seen a F-18 at close range he perfectly maneuvers it into the laser beam. - is it really that easy to destroy a Alien Mothership? well if it is we now know that we only have to use a MAC-Virus. - why on hell can we see comets like 'Hale Bopp' and not a UFO aproaching?Well at least I´m not the only one thinking like that!",1,3,6,19 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The greates Epic ever banned on Film!
","The problem with this picture is that it is nearly impossible to top it.Why?Well: excellent Script; wonderful cast; brilliant SET-DESIGN, Sound, Special Effects, Make-Up FX(Yoda seem much more real than in the 'Phantom'); Funny; Wonderful Battle Scenes(HOTH); has a message; nearly no Violence and many other features....This movie combines so many things and makes them perfect!One of the best achievements in Art(belongs in to the Louvre) and Moviebuisness!Watch it!",10,0,0,19 July 1999
