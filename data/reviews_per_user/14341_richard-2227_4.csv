Skyfall," Boring
","I don't usually write reviews. But how is it possible to make a BORING Bond film? The pacing was lethargic, the directing insipid. Sam Mendes isn't the right director for this genre and the chases and stunts we have ALL seen before. From the opening scene, we were just in rewind. Nothing new here.There were glaring issues: the goal of recovering the hard drive faded as the movie went on. Bond's pistol with signature grip is treated as something new. There were continuity issues--Bond's old rifle at Skyfall suddenly becomes a shotgun. And an entire group of hit men walk past the old Aston with Bond lying down inside. Where the HELL is Martin Campbell when you need him? And why isn't Daniel Craig smart enough to put a good team around him? Script, script, script. If the money they spent bribing the media about this film went into the production, then hey maybe they had half a chance. But the movie industry doesn't work like that.There's NO WAY IMDb has an average for this movie of 8 out of 10. Did the producers simply pay off IMDb too? Casino Royale is the best Bond film in living memory. I just feel so sorry for Daniel Craig. A good actor who cares about his part. Surrounded by underachievers.Kill off the franchise or treat it seriously. But don't do this!Boring.",1,13,29,17 November 2012
District 9," Ground breaking
","District 9 succeeds because it takes you through the full range of human emotion: rage, disgust, fear, friendship and unity. And believe me, you WILL feel them because this film is THAT good.Perhaps one of the stronger themes is selfishness: Wikus makes some stupid decisions which cost him time...something he manifestly lacks. These actions hurt himself and those around him, causing the viewer to wonder if this story is REALLY going to unravel.Leaving aside the special effects I think the film stands alone as a commentary on division, hate, and oppression. And more disturbingly a real expose on the darkness of the human heart. It's shocking because we treat each other this way now.There is a real moment in this film when Wikus has to abandon his fear and loathing and do what is right--even if it costs him everything. The choice that seems impossible is the one he must take, and thankfully does.District 9 is a real thought-provoker and probably needs to be seen more than once.Congratulations to all involved and I look forward to more films of this calibre!",10,4,8,22 August 2009
Avatar," Spectacular!
","Never before has any film EVER delivered such a rich experience!Nature and animals jump out the screen for you and provide a rich tapestry of characters to explore. Our audience clapped at the end, and 3 hours passed like 90 minutes.Action, dialog, plot, theme--everything was first class. A lifetime's achievement from a very talented man. So proud New Zealand was again a big part of this. Watch out for more to come!J.C. is probably the best screenwriter working in the world today.Well done Jim! The best film I have EVER seen.A masterpiece!",10,2,8,17 December 2009
Prometheus," Terrific!
","I don't know why everyone hates this movie!I had the same response to this as Avatar: that some gifted artists had worked incredibly hard on a terrific piece of storytelling. It's big, utterly consuming, terrifying, well cast and fun at times. It uses modern cues to create a spellbinding vision--there is certainly beauty amongst the mayhem.The movie got derailed somewhat in that they set out to find the gods and end up fighting for their lives. When they finally meet their maker, he displays no interest in them--which was a let down.The intent is recovered at the end as they disappear in search of more adventure. But the heroine confuses 'God' with 'alien races'. And that hints at more carnage to come if they make a sequel.P.S. Fassbender is a freak and I look forward to more of his work!",10,15,33,6 June 2012
