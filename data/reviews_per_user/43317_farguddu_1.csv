Skyfall," A complete letdown!
","I actually went to the cinema with huge expectations after a lot of positive feedback and raving reviews by the critics.After a promising start, I thought it was going to be a roller coaster ride all the way through, but my excitement was only short lived as the movie kept losing its ground and transformed into a boring, dull drama.I didn't understand the plot at all. There was hardly any jaw-dropping action sequences to which these bond films are so notorious for.In my opinion, Bérénice Marlohe was simply wasted. Her entry was quite strong, but her role simply lacked any substance. Her looks were simply infectious though. Naomie Harris was uninspiring.Daniel Craig did very well, but his expressions felt a bit too cold throughout. Javier Bardem was the real star of the movie. I simply loved his performance.Overall, it was a complete letdown to me. Hardly any action. No Bond girls. The movie is lacking its signature Bond feel.4/10 (only for Javier Bardem and the stunning Bérénice Marlohe).",4,9,21,12 November 2012
