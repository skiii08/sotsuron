Alien 3," the peaceful heavenly white cloth of her sleep chamber is smudged by red and we see our heroine fall into the pit of hell below.
","It's interesting to see that this film has had so many comments posted about it, behind the scenes it's still the most interesting of the Alien films. I have to admit to not wanting to watch this film again after seeing it at the cinema. I read the novelisation by Dean Foster (I think?) It was apparent that the studio had really messed about with the story. I was most angry that they had cut the whole plot stream of poor Golic thinking this creature was the messiah and freeing it from it's containment chamber. It just made a mess of the whole middle section of the film. It's a shame they had so little faith in Fincher, but now that this film has been re-edited it's my favourite of the sequels, in that it's much closer in tone to Alien. I love that it's so bleak, none of the Arnie-esquire witty one liners of the fourth. In this film we see that she has really lost everything from her past, present and future, even down to her clothes and hair!. I still think the acting is a bit wobbly, 'they think we're crud', oh dear, but on the whole a fitting end to the franchise (if only that were so).",9,5,8,23 December 2004
