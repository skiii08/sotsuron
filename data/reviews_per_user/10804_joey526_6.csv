The Blair Witch Project," Not really scary but very inventive
","Thinking more about the movie I was a little disappointed. I really expected to be very scared after all the hype. And than with all the radio stations saying the movie is not real and the story is made up...well I think that killed the movie. If I would have gone into the theater believing it was based on a real story, I would have been a lot more scared. But I have to give credit to the directors, they had an original idea. Never before have I experienced a movie like this, I would recommend anyone to go see it. It is a new and inventive approach to movie making and very interesting.",Null,1,1,3 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I thought it was great!
",I thought the movie was great. There were some parts that seemed unbelievable but hey that's what makes it science fiction. This is a must see. I do have to say it was hard to understand the Jar Jar Binks character but he was for the kids. On another note the new Dolby 6.1 sound was amazing...rumor has it George Lucas had something to do with the design of that. I can hardly wait for the next part of the sequel and to see what George Lucas has in store for us next.......,10,0,0,16 June 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," disappointed
",Maybe I expected too much from this movie but I did not think it was worth the price of the tickets. If I would have seen it on TV for free it would've been more enjoyable. I really liked Parker/Stone's other movie BaseketBall which kept me laughing all the way through the movie. But this movie just disappointed me.,5,0,2,26 July 1999
Notting Hill," Very Enjoyable
","I honestly did not expect much from this movie. I bought it for my wife for Christmas and finally sat down to watch it. I was in awe by the end of the movie. This movie has a lot to offer. It is funny, romantic, and even a little dramatic. I would say it was not a waste of money at all.",9,0,0,28 December 1999
BASEketball," Trey Parker and Matt Stone and amazing together.
",The 2 creators of South Park compliment one another extremely well in the film. They keep the humor going from beginning to end. Remember to keep your eye on things happening in the background or you may miss some funny parts. I look forward to seeing Trey Parker and Matt Stone in another movie.,8,0,1,26 April 1999
The Matrix," Amazing
","I rented this movie last night on DVD. I sat down and watched it with dolby's wonderful digital surround sound....WOW. The effects are amazing, this movie belongs in the top 20 here at IMDB. The movie left me wanting/hoping for more. I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes sci-fi and action films. I will be watching this one again soon.",9,0,0,29 September 1999
