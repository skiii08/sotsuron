The Blair Witch Project," Brilliant horror movie
","This is a brilliant horror movie. Fans of the genre knows this. The reason there has been so much criticism of the movie is that non-horror fans where lured to see it as a semi-documentary! This is pretty naive of course, I mean to think that it is reality... arrrghhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!......... this note was found in the woods last year.",8,2,3,6 November 2003
Source Code," Interesting but like a weak Twilight Zone episode
","This movie really makes all the mistakes that a Rod Serling or an Alfred Hitchcock would NOT have made. I don't want to give any spoilers but the issue here in this sci-fi area is about information. Who knows what about what? And it really does not add anything to the plot here the way it is done. It does not add anything to the suspense either. It just makes us wonder: 'Why are the characters pretending they don't have information of what is going on?' It would have been much more interesting if the VIEWER did not know what is going on. But this cliché about the main character not knowing who he is, identity, etc. is just not working at all in this movie. The movie has other qualities though, and it is really like a Twilight Episode. One of the weaker episodes though.",7,0,1,5 January 2012
Se7en," Amazing thriller
","This is an amazing thriller setting new standards. I would recommend this to everybody who wants to know about film. Personally I would only watch it once though - because, like the Hitchcock movies, it depends a lot upon the mindblowing mystery and confusion of the things that are going on.",8,0,0,1 January 2004
Akira," A masterpiece
","This is the 'Watchmen' of the Orient. An awesome masterpiece which has so much to say to young people. The struggle in 2019 in Neo-Tokyo by the orphaned teenagers is our struggle. We identify with Tetsuo and his horrifying decent from childhood into manhood and beyond. A marvelous superhero story and the human relations. Tetsuo´s girlfriend and 'best friend' we know and understand these problems. Akira remains the elusive opponent of Tetsuo. But in reality the battle is not between Tetsuo and Akira but between Tetsuo, his friends and the leaders of Neo-Tokyo. I cannot emphasize how much I recommend this movie. It is the animated version of Kurosawa blending with the modern art of Tsukamoto´s 'Tetsuo' which is definitely build on 'Akira'. I didn´t know that until I saw it today. I guess it has something to do with the Japanese concept of 'Manga'. Anyhow, don´t believe the 'low' rating for Akira on IMDB. This is one of the most important films ever made. 10/10.",7,4,7,5 June 2004
Rocky V," Difficult movie to relate to
","I thought some scenes in this movie are very good, but others are downright stupid, so it is a very difficult movie to evaluate. I saw Rocky Balboa (Rocky 6) when it came out, and I must say, it is not a very credible update of the father-son relationship. So this movie was a strange experience to watch but I guess it fits in pretty well with the series. I just saw number 2 yesterday, and I have seen number 3 and 4 but I do not remember them too well. Anyway, now that I have seen the whole series, I think it is quite an interesting story. However, some of the pseudo-stuff in these movies is a bit too stupid. Look forward to Rambo 5.",5,1,3,9 February 2010
Hostel," Excellent horror movie
","I was one of those who didn't like 'Cabin Fever' but I must say I was pleasantly surprised about 'Hostel'. I all ready knew the plot: (Spoiler Alert!!!!): which is: Travel, sex, porn, torture, escape, revenge. It is a bad plot but one does not view such movies for the plot but for the effect and the suspense. This movie is one of the most suspenseful I have ever seen. It's true that the acting is lacking at places, and also that there is no realism in the plot (Spoiler alert again!): These people have no motive to torture. No one would pay to do this. It's true people torture each other for all sorts of reasons but not for the reasons in this movie. It is very persuasive but still not realistic. Moreover (more spoiler alerts!) the notion that the last surviving guy just whacks off all his victimizers in a single sweep sort of meeting all of them on his way home is not realistic at all. The way he escapes from the tortures is also pretty dumb. Why not just walk out? He had a gun. Surely it would not be easier to hide among the corpses and hope for the best while he was being transported somewhere. Anyway, this is surely a great movie about how rough Europe maybe especially Eastern Europe can be!",7,2,4,30 April 2006
127 Hours," Is this a joke????
",I bought this on DVD for around 12 dollars today and looked forward to seeing it. Imagine my surprise. This movie is just crap. A sort of parody on Touching the Void which is the real thing. There is really nothing in this movie. The actor looks like he is perfectly on top of the situation no matter what happens. At one point we just lose interest. It must have been horrible to be stuck in the cinema with this one. It is so boring. I recommend Touching the Void instead which is a really great movie and story and book about a great subject that is quite similar to this but far more interesting and realistic. To be quite honest I really lost interest in 127 hours and is now writing the review while the movie is playing in the background. I just realized that I really did not care what happened. There is just no suspense at all. It is a terrible movie. Not only is it bad it is also incredibly boring and a complete waste of time.,4,4,9,19 September 2011
The Adventures of Tintin," Excellent
","This movie is really excellent. More like an Indiana Jones movie really it grips the viewer from start to finish and you leave the cinema feeling uplifted and better about humanity. Both Tintin's dog and the people in this movie are better than people in real life and that makes it a splendid story. I'm not sure where Hergé got his storytelling drive from but he sure was an excellent storyteller. In another review a user said that the story has been changed but that seems fairly useless to say because the movie does not claim to be an adaption of one comic-book but rather to be based on the whole series. Moreover, the story is quite good, I think. Naturally, it would be logical to adapt Tintin to this modern-day martial artist Bruce Lee/James Bond type of character but actually this is not the case. In the movie he remains the Tintin we know and love from the great comic-books.",7,2,8,29 October 2011
Lost in Translation," Basically a perfect movie
","This is one of the best movies I have seen in years. 10/10. It´s a wonderful and sweet love-story. A good comedy, drama and all that. The two lead actors are great. The dialogue is very good. It´s everything cinema should be about. It seems to pay homage to Jarmusch masterpieces such as 'Down By Law' although Lost in Translation is very different though. It´s so much like a trip to Tokyo. Not bad for the price of a DVD or a cinema ticket. And there´s no degrading sex-scenes or superflous emotions in the relations described. Everything is very credible like, say, in 'Good Will Hunting'. The examination of Buddhism´s role in Japanese culture is also very clever. The Americans basically doesn´t have a clue what Buddhism is about. The relations in this movie reminded me so much of my own relations to people. As another viewer wrote: 'Isolation finds an expression in love.'",8,0,1,3 September 2004
Interstellar," A complete waste of time
","I would agree with the haters on this movie. I love Rustin Cohle and Matt Damon but this movie is a waste of time. God, I hate it so much. It is stupid and shallow. Rustin Cohle and Jason Bourne in the same movie yet they are given stupid lines to say. What an absolute bad movie. Movies like this are really a horrible warning of the horrible and terrible times we live in where insane nonsense rubbish like that is considered quality. What is wrong with Christopher Nolan? Memento is a great movie. The first Batman pretty cool (best Batman movie) although a bit shallow perhaps (vague existentialism like 'my actions define me'). Other Batman movies not very good. Inception interesting but ultimately failing and Interstellar interesting but ultimately failing. What kind of audience seriously want to see shitty like that? Compare with my generation who grew up with intelligent and suave sci-fi like 2001 and Blade Runner. And the anti-natalist Rustin Cohle is virtually ridiculed by now playing a stupid natalist. Interstellar is quite simply rubbish. It is trash. It reeks of stupidity and failure.",4,3,4,7 March 2016
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Excellent. One of the best Star Wars episodes.
","I was astonished to see the relatively low rating on this one. I thought it was much better than the 1999 movie. I didn't see the 2005 movie but I'd like to see it. I've seen all the other ones also. I think the story of Anakin Skywalker is very compelling. The young boy who played Skywalker in the 1999 movie really did a good job, and there is some great acting in Attack of the Clones as well. For example, Christopher Lee in a menacing role. Moreover, I think there were some great focus on details and it had the flavor of the real Star Wars merchandise. The assassin-robot is just great. I mean, the mercenary. Moreover, from a science-fiction point of view it is hard to see anything more visionary these days than what came out of the Star Wars saga. George Lucas is a great visionary and has a great imagination which is also evident in the 'Lucasfilm' computer-games such as Maniac Mansion and Zak McCracken. Games that had an enormous impact on me as a child. Now I look forward to watching the new Indiana Jones movie...",7,0,3,8 March 2008
Watchmen," Fairly good adaptation
","It was an impossible job to adapt the graphic novel to a movie. However, this film does a fairly good job. '300' was also a very powerful movie, and 'Watchmen' seems to be loyal and fair to the novel. 'Watchmen' as a comic-book made a great impression on me when I was a teenager, so I was looking forward to seeing this movie. It didn't disappoint me, and I am probably going to watch it again. Especially Rorschach was quite impressive. I, perhaps, had a problem with some of the music, putting in Leonard Cohen and Simon and Garfunkel's 'Sound of Silence' doesn't necessarily capture the essence of the Watchmen comic book. Why not put in the quotes by Nietzsche and Jung then? And there's a quote from the 'book of Job' as well. These were left out in the movie. Also I thought it was a bit funny that all the heroes fight in the martial arts style taken to the big screen originally by Bruce Lee. Very nice - sort of reminded about the science-fiction movie 'Equlibirium'. Some things were changed in the movie. Sometimes for obscure reasons. But anyway it would have been impossible to get it all in a 2-hour movie. Unlike other Alan Moore adaptations such as 'V for Vendetta' the changes in this movie still keeps, I think, the essence of the graphic novel intact. Others might disagree about this. I don't know what Alan Moore thinks about this movie. Apparently he doesn't want to see it and I don't think his name was mentioned at all in the credits. However, it was very interesting to see this movie and I cried several times because of the intensity of the drama. I've heard that there is a Watchmen computer game out also. I don't know if it is any good though. Anyway, I am probably going to watch this movie again.",8,1,3,17 March 2009
The Bourne Identity," Closest thing one gets to modern-day ninjas
","I just saw these films and look forward to a sequel. These Bourne movies rock. The best action since Raiders of the Lost Ark. As opposed to the recent James Bond movies the Bourne movies actually makes sense.The CIA is portrayed as a violent, corrupt brainwashing cult, and Bourne as an archetypal, warrior-hero trying to fight his way out. Meantime he is being attacked by cia-ninja assassins and he himself is one of them. These people are the only ones who fight back. Normal people don't. The CIA-treadstone, as they are called, assassins are obviously trained very well in martial arts. Highly recommended. The first one is even better than the second, I think. Bourne is more cool in the second but the story in the first one is even more astonishing. 10/10.",9,2,5,19 October 2004
The Thing," Excellent!
","No doubt one of the best horror movies ever made. The special effects are so mind-blowing that one can almost not believe it. This is made before computer graphics, so one becomes aware of the artistic genius behind the special effects. I saw this as a child. It is super cool. A real 80s movie. Later I found out the H.P.Lovecraftian spawning of the movie. Anyway, it's great. Watch it! All sci-fi and horror fans should see this movie, and despair! Only thing I found a bit weird was the beginning with the spaceship that is flying to Earth. Perhaps that is a bit too much, since this is a monster-movie more than anything else. Moreover, one has a feeling that it is a present-day Earth, so it doesn't fit in with the plot of the UFO having landed a long time ago. Anyway, despite 'goofs' and 'mistakes' this movie is on my top 10 of favorite movies. Of course, the reason for this is also the excellent acting and dialog, such as great lines like: 'Maybe we are at war with Norway!' All things considered, this is a great movie which can be seen again and again. There is so much detail in the characters, plot and effects. Moreover, it is shot in a beautiful location in Alaska. The DVD also contains some very good extra-material.",10,0,1,16 January 2004
American Psycho," Fairly good adaptation
","I just saw this yesterday. I think Christian Bale is a great actor also in Equilibrium and Batman, and he really does a good job playing Patrick Bateman. Anyway, having also recently read the book, I don't think it did a fair job to the book. Anyway, that is impossible. It is like the adaptation of Watchmen. Simply impossible, so why even try? Nevertheless, both the Watchmen movie and the American Psycho movie has turned out to be rather interesting. A weak aspect of the American Psycho movie was that some of the interesting dialogue was cut out. For example, Ted Bundy's name is mentioned in the book but left out in the movie. It would have been powerful to hear Ted Bundy's name spoken out in the movie, since the Bateman character is incredibly much inspired by Ted Bundy's story. Actually, it is amazing what a genius Breat Easton Ellis is. He is like a living Dostoyevski. His psychological insight into the Bateman character is incredible, and naturally this is impossible to bring to the big screen.",7,0,0,30 November 2009
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Cool action movie
","This is a great movie. I was very entertained, and the movie picks up where number two left off, and is still faithful to the two first. Especially the first, maybe. The female killer-robot is just awesome. The story could be more interesting but it certainly connects well the pieces of the puzzle.",7,0,0,9 August 2003
Van Helsing," Every horror fan's dream come true!
","Don't believe the bad reviews of this film. It is excellent. It has all the right material and it really does well with it. In the end it all works out. The CGI are probably the best I have seen in any movie. The Van Helsinger character is everything the Batman movie should have been. He is The Dark Knight par excellence. He is the Indiana Jones of the 19th century. This movie is about as good as 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and far better than the other Indiana Jones movies. It is really great to see Dracula, Dr.Frankenstein, Frankenstein's monster, the Wolfman and Dr. Jekyll and Mr.Hyde in one movie. It is like an edition of 'Leauge of Extraordinary Gentlemen' with a special eye for horror. Maybe the action becomes a bit too much sometimes but the young Van Helsing is an action character as opposed to the older who is more scientifically minded. Anyway, the bad reviews are given by people who don't appreciate horror. Don't believe it. This is the dream of every horror fan.",7,1,2,6 May 2004
The Exorcist," Great horror movie
",This is great horror. Really 'for the Lord!' Scary. Fantastic. Convincing. Very adventorous. A real classic must-see of movie and horrorhistory. There´s almost no limits to how scary this one is depending on how much one believes in demonic possession. The little girl´s possession is very convincing.,8,2,3,21 December 2003
28 Days Later...," Extremely stylish horror film
","I thought this movie was quite good until about an hour into it. After that it becomes stunning and hypnotic. It's just amazing. This is an unusually good horror movie. I thought it looked boring but then I saw in a interview with the great artist Clive Barker that he thought it was good, so I decided to watch it, and I must say he is right. It's very good. I really liked the characters. The girl is a good actor. The other actors are also very good. It's a zombie movie for the 21st century. It is also a great fantasy movie with very interesting spiritual twists, and not only violence. The scene where he walks around in London reminded me of my own day in London where I was all alone, and only managed to walk a little around the bridges. I went to 'The London Dungeon' but didn't have time to go in. I guess everyone has dreamt about the same, that is, to see a completely abandoned major city. It's the 'what if...?' fantasy. 10/10. Highly recommended and an absolute must for people who like horror.",6,4,8,25 May 2004
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," This movie is so bad
","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is such a bad movie. The love stories don´t make sense at all. The cute princess is so annoying. The violence does not make any sense either. All in all a perfectly pointless movie.Why should we care about these stupid characters who act in such meaningless ways?",4,6,14,24 October 2003
Pawn Sacrifice," Very good movie
","1. Young Bobby. Pretty good description of chess. He likes chess as a shield towards a dangerous world. Unlikely that he would play 1.d4,c4 etc. It is Fischer!!! Moreover, he puts the king down. Something he would never have done. Why put the king down? 2. Teen Bobby. Pretty cool too. Some weird stuff. He moves h4 and h5 on a chessboard looking into an Informator. Why? 3. Adult Bobby. Excellent acting by Tobey Maguire. Spasskij and Lombardy are awesome as well. 4. Why is Larsen cut out both of the documentary and this movie? No mention of the 6- 0 defeat of Larsen. WHY??? 5. When Fischer takes on h2 it is not actually a big mistake. Computer says small white advantage and his NEXT move h5 is a mistake according to stockfish. There are options of going to the queen side with the king. Fischer was winning stuff like that all the time but Spasskij played it well. Taking on h2 is risky though. It is portrayed like a big Patzer mistake and falsely that he resigned after g3. 6. Nh5 in the benoni game is sort of normal 7. The sixth game of the match is a beautiful game but not that great. Weak play by Spasskij. 8. Fischer never said anything wrong before AFTER he became world champion. They are mixing that up 9. The incident with the hooker is funny but wouldn't Bobby have been scared of stds? 10. He says check when giving a check. Wtf is up with that? 11. Did he actually have a close relationship with his sister Joan? 12. Did he actually have any contact with his mother even in the mid-60s? 13. The role of Donald Byrne is a bit weak but perhaps mainly because the 3 other guys are so awesome. 14. Relation with Lombardy wildly exaggerated 15. Other than that most of the chess was very accurate. The positions on the board are correct and so on. 16. They use old notation which was changed in 1981 so it is not that easy to follow their blindfold games (although it was translated into the new notation). 17. Anyway, awesome movie. 18. The incident with the chair. Spasskij wouldn't have done that in front of the board and everything although that did in fact happen (the thing with the two dead flies). 19. The conversation with the hooker about opening preparation seems a bit more like a candidate master than a strong grandmaster.",8,5,9,19 September 2015
Paranormal Activity," Scary
","I just saw this tonight in the cinema, and a lot of young people were screaming a lot and were quite affected by this movie. It is indeed very effective. The special effects are very good. I thought, perhaps, the acting was a bit weak, but it is more than made up for by amazing effects where you keep thinking: 'How did they do it?' However, this is more like a real film which has been edited so the whole Blair Witch thing seems to be something else. This cannot have been the couple's camera that we did see. Anyway, the whole thing is very much like a meta-documentary even referring to Monty Python's Holy Grail, I think, at one point Mikah says: 'What is your quest? What is your favorite color' or something like that, clearly a reference to Monty Python's famous movie. Anwyay, the whole thing is very intertextual and actually quite funny but also quite moving and scary. Highly recommended, especially for fans of fantasy and the occult.",8,1,5,17 December 2009
Saw," Great disappointment
","I looked forward to seeing this but it was a great bore and sickeningly sadistic for no purpose. For example the scenes where we see the 'terror' of the doctor's family. It adds nothing to the story. The acting is poor, the direction is poor. The story is good but gets completely ruined. The film is just way too dark in a disturbing and pointless way. There were some young women in the cinema who were giggling through the whole movie. I felt sorry for them that they had chosen to see such a bleak movie. It's astonishing that this movie, of all 'horror' films, should get such a high rating on IMDb. It should really be exposed for what it is: A sadistic MTV-rock video with no purpose other than to waste people's time. The 'surprise'ending is good and astonishing, although I must say I don't quite get it, and don't quite care.",8,1,2,4 March 2005
The Fly," Not succesful
","I´m a big Cronenberg connoseur and have seen all his work. This one, his commercial succes, and most popular movies has a major flaw. The acting of Jeff Goldblum. Although it´s pretty intense it just falls short of the more truthful acting performances in 'Videdrome' and 'Scanners'. Somehow Goldblum just doesn´t fit in a horror-sci-fi Cronenberg picture and not surprisingly they have never attempted to repeat the 'succes'. Although very 80s and impressive for its time I think this movie is a big compromise with Cronenbergs ideals. I think his early and late work (especially 'Videodrome II - Existenz') is the best. 'Spider' and 'Madame Butterfly' was interesting too (notice the references to insects). Insects are rather interesting, I agree. This fly just don´t fly. Brundle fly.",8,1,6,18 June 2004
The Descent," Overrated
","I liked this better than 'Dog Soldiers', and I think Neil Marshall is a great talent in the horror genre. I look forward to seeing more movies by him. However, I think both Dog Soldiers and The Descent are problematic as horror movies. There's no real supernatural feel. The shocks are not scary. Japanese and south eastern Asian horror (such as 'the eye') make scary shocks. The move by Hollywood to just try and copy what they couldn't have done themselves is pathetic, I think. The descent is a British movie, and it shows. It is better than a lot of recent American horror. However, my main problem with the descent except that it has little or no suspense is that the plot is devoid of logic. What is the connection between the accident and the descent into the cave with the monsters? Let me tell you: THERE IS NO CONNECTION. Thus the plot is not making sense. You can analyze this as much as you want to and try and see connections but take my word for it: there isn't any. It's just some kind of plot decoy which in the end didn't seem to fit although it might have been intended. Moreover, whereas the accident is exciting and seems to make sense in terms of horror, all the non-horror things in this movie is just so borderline superfluous that it sort of ruins the occasional splendid elements of successful horror.",7,1,3,15 February 2006
The Shape of Water," Insult towards horror
","Supposed Lovecraft fan makes another bad movie. The only Lovecraft here is the cat killing scene which might be a reference to Cats of Ulthar. Other than that I doubt this director understands the dignity of Lovecraft. This movie is just stupid. I mean it has all the cliches. Not as bad as other crap coming out of Hollywood these days but it just follows all the cliches with unlikable characters, zero logic, predictive programming and just pile of garbage after garbage.",4,13,39,11 April 2018
Psycho," The best movie ever made?
",This is possibly the most brilliant movie ever made. Both technically and in terms of theme. I cannot even begin to praise it. Hitchcock is obviously the last true cinematic genious. Genuinely ghostly this movie will haunt us for ever. Deserves to be among the greatest artworks of the 20th Century.,10,0,1,30 July 2003
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Don't let the bastards get you down!
","This is an excellent movie. Nicholason is awesome and the acting is generally very good. The only problem I would have with it is the unrealistic way the mental patients are described. This is hardly the way it is to be insane. The movie is also a bit sentimental like for example scenes where we see severely sick people partying at Christmas. What joy could they possible get out of that? However, all this is excused because the plot is so good. The role of the big Indian really makes sense, and this is, of course, really the story of America. 'They killed him.' 'I'm not saying they killed him. They were working on him like they are working on you.' This is the conversation between Nicholson and the Indian. It is very true. This is what 'society' does to you as a person. There's always going to be some people who are 'working on you' to get you down. But this movie is saying: 'Don't let the bastards get you down!'",8,1,2,3 March 2006
Bram Stoker's Dracula," This movie is absolute crap
","Has absolutely no merits whatsoever. Two sentences of the first four chapters of the book are better than this movie can ever hope for even in the most optimistic viewer. The lovestory is so stupid. The characters are very bad. Dracula is not a monster at all, but just some ordinary British guy trying to look cool. The women act like oppressed teenagers. Hopkins tries to steal the movie with his gigant ego, playing Van Helsing and might seduce some insecure teenagers into thinking he is cool. Stupid... stupip... stupid...",4,18,36,28 September 2003
Jaws," Megala - who?
","This is a great movie, no doubt about it. 10/10. However, 'Jaws' has just been toppled in terms of underwater horror in Shark Attack III, where there is a much more scary Megalodeon shark which is 100 times bigger than the big shark in Jaws. I therefore recommend watching 'Shark Attack III' - at least the scenes with the megalodeon shark.",8,2,4,24 October 2003
The Shawshank Redemption," Very interesting
","I think this movie is clearly a 10. To call it the second best movie of all time might be a bit over the top. However, it is impressive that it has got almost 120.000 votes. Anyway, I thought it was really interesting. Tim Robbins is a very good actor and so is Morgan Freeman. Anyway, there is one thing that annoys me, and that is the focus on what one might call 'transgression'. I mean the warden and sadistic prison guards - all this is a bit too far out I think and works to the movies disadvantage. The love of transgression is always followed by some kind of sentimental prejudice. However, that does not damage the movie as a whole. It's really an amazing story which keeps you guessing till the end.",8,0,0,19 June 2004
1408," Pretty much crap
","This is a typical horror movie of that period. The mind-frame of American horror at the time was to not make scary movies and this movie is not scary either. Obviously the Swedish director knows nothing what so ever about the horror genre which is also obvious from the director commentary on the DVD. This movie is a joke. Cusack does a great job, but the only scary scene in the movie is towards the end with Samuel Jackson in a car. All things considered, these are the kinds of horror movies that makes horror not worth seeing. Sad thing is one can almost sense that they try to get all kinds of other genres in it, even bragging about it, how it is 'funny' and how it is 'good drama' and good 'character-building' but the horror element is totally neglected.",7,1,3,12 November 2011
Mother!," BS
","I liked Wrestler by the same director but this movie is really shit. The symbolism is a good idea but ruined by not keeping it symbolic. The movie shifts between normal behaviour dialogue to the symbolic. It is just idiotic not to keep it consistent. I understand the symbolism as does any other viewer (ie God, Mother Nature, Adam, Eve, etc.) and that is a great idea but it is totally ruined firstly by not making it into a horror movie and secondly by not keeping to the symbolism. They put in the usual Hollywood bullshit of trying to be normal while it could have been a good movie if they had just kept to the symbolism about reality. As this movie stands it is absolute crap and really an insult to pessimism since it tries to market itself as attractive to pessimism.",3,1,2,27 March 2018
Ben-Hur," Epic masterpiece
","This is quite possible one of the best movies made about Christ. Although Ben Hur is the main character there is quite a lot about the mythology of Christ in this movie. For its time it was probably one of the best adventure movies. It is still excellent today but perhaps not quite as good as some of the adventure movies that came after. However, the story is very interesting and Charlton Heston does a great job, just like he does in 'The Planet of the Apes'. Some plot elements are perhaps a bit primitive but the good thing about this movie is the way the viewer can identify with the feelings of the main character. We really feel his pain about the persecution of his people and family. The movie is rightly famous for the horse race towards the end. This is really a movie which is still relevant today also because of the mythological elements it contains.",8,0,2,2 July 2009
Live Free or Die Hard," Could they have made this more realistic?
","I like Bruce Willis and Die Hard and all that, but my problem with this movie is the computer-stuff. I mean, I have a bachelor-degree in information science but besides that I've never been that much into computers, however, I can clearly see that those things they do in this movie are not possible for real. It would have been much better if they had kept it more realistic. It's a great idea about cyber-terrorists and all that but if they don't even TRY to make it believable, then it's really not that interesting. I don't believe for one second that a lot of those things are possible. Some of them might be but others are surely not. So that makes some of the interest in the movie go away.",7,0,1,21 January 2008
Rear Window," Very interesting
","I just saw this movie again, and it is very interesting. Along with Vertigo it is one of Hitchcock's most interesting movies. It is really scary the way we are slowly drawn into the murder, and given little clues and diversions. Hitchcock is a master at that, and like in the other movie with James Stevart (Vertigo) this movie is almost bordering on the supernatural. This is what makes it so scary. It is not the same horror as in Psycho but it is extremely eerie and disturbing. We wonder what is going on, and are constantly forced to be extremely careful in evaluating what we see on the screen. The story unfolds very nicely leading up to a good climax. I think Vertigo is even better than Rear Window, but in a way they are telling the same story, and both of them are very weird, bordering on the supernatural and playing with what is possible in the real world.",8,1,4,15 September 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Disappointing
",I had expected more of this movie but in the end it turns out just as boring as the book. I´d give this 7/10. It´s really nothing but the story of an old schoolmaster who has trouble manifesting his will to power and Freudian problems as well. The interesting characters are not given a chance while the boring ones are given full play in this last series. Also the computergraphics are uninteresting. What has Peter Jackson been thinking? Surely he could have done better than this.,7,0,0,18 December 2003
300," After re-watching this I wanted to write a review
","I saw this again and it occurred to me what a disaster the whole subplot with the Queen and all that is. That story is not in Miller's original comic book and it really is quite horrible in the movie. It is quite a shame because if that had not been there it would have been an excellent movie. It is a bit like with Watchmen: Some of it is OK, and some of it is a total disaster. I would like to see a cut of 300 where there was only the good things. It is really quite a shame that a pointless subplot that has nothing to do with the battle has been cut into the movie. Anyway, that is what I wanted to say. I think it is a good movie but I would not want to watch it again because it is only like 50% of the scenes that are good.",7,0,0,21 August 2012
Saboteur," Not bad
","I have bought a Hitchcock DVD collection at my local video store. This was the first movie in the collection. I must say it is quite good. However, there seems to be a bit too much dialogue as opposed to later when he really learned to tell a story with more precise dialogue. Anyway, it is far ahead of its time for sure. Very interesting movie. It looks normal, however, it has that Hitchcock touch where he creates incredible situations that only he could create. The movie reminded me a bit of 'The Fugitive' and has a similar plot in a way. I look forward to watching the other movies in the collection. My favorite Hitchcock movies are Rear Window, Vertigo and Psycho.",6,1,5,7 December 2014
Donnie Darko," I found this movie very interesting
","I thought this was an excellent movie. It really shows American life from an honest side while at the side time being really imaginative like a Twilight Zone episode. The character Donnie Darko is also very interesting. It is difficult for me to explain why I like this movie so much. I think it must be because of the story, and because like The Butterfly Effect it is independent cinema. For example, in these movie there are clever meta-references and intertextuality. There is something amazing about seeing people in new movies go in to see Evil Dead and Se7en like they do in Donnie Darko and The Butterfly Effect. I think, that is pretty amazing. Evil Dead is a brilliant movie, by the way. Anyway, I cannot explain why I like the Donnie Darko movie but I really do. Maybe it is because of the main character and his emotional problems, which I guess most of us can identify with, even though there is nothing wrong with us. Also it is a nice critique of the self-help genre in the movie where it turns out that the self-help guru is actually totally miserable himself. I think, that is a good point.",8,0,1,6 December 2009
The Bourne Supremacy," Bourne to rock!
","This is a super-cool movie. *Minor Spoilers ahead* I just think the movie basically is a one-man show for Damon/Bourne to show how cool and super-human he is. Therefore I would give it 9/10 and not 10/10. It's a good story, state-of-the-art action and suspense, etc., however I still think it's pretty silly judging it from outside its genre. Surely there is no reason to use tax-payers money on all this silly stuff. I really like the scene where Bourney is in Moscow and he steals the Vodka, and drinks from the bottle while beating up police. This is awesome stuff that Indiana Jones would have been proud of. It really reminded me of some of my own traveling around the world. Moreover, the woman he meets in AlexanderstraBe is REALLY cute and hot-looking! Just my type. Speaking of action-suspense movies 'Man on Fire' is probably slightly better than this movie, which, as I've said, is mostly just play for the gallery.",8,1,2,18 October 2004
