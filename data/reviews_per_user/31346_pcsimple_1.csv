The Avengers," THE Best Movie of The Decade
","'Did anybody see Inception? I think that was just about the most ambitious movie I've ever seen. And then I thought wait a god damn second Marvel Studios is going to take all their top superheroes, and they're going to put them all together in The Avengers. That's the most ambitious movie I've ever seen!' – Robert Downey Jr. (Comic Con 2010)It may have been the most ambitious movie ever but boy did they pull it off! There was always a small doubt that The Avengers (2012) may have been a flop for a couple of reasons. The first is the fact that the Captain America (2011) and Iron Man 2 (2010) were slightly lower than the standard of movies Marvel studios had shot out since 2008 when The Incredible Hulk (2008) hit the big screens. Obviously this lower standard must have been due to The Avengers being in production because the film topped my list of favourite films and became number 1, yes, it took over The Dark Knight (2008)!To read the full review go here: http://www.teknue.com/reviews/review- the-avengersavengers-assemble-2012/852",10,28,54,12 July 2012
