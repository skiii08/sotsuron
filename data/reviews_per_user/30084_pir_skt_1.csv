Requiem for a Dream," Strong and intense, but a must watch for everyone.
","To me what says if a movie is good or bad is the intensity and variety of emotions that I feel while watching. And Requiem for a Dream was really intense.Movies like this make me wish a machine that erases memories, just so I can watch again, feel again. The drama is strong and realistic. I think if all teenagers watched this before leaving school, things would be better. You know that movies you watch and kind of feel bad for a week? But it is a good bad feeling, that you enjoy and makes you think. Actually, we are lazy to think about things, or afraid, or even both. Movies like this breaks this barrier. It is very unlikely it wont stuck in your head for a while. I also loved the screenplay, soundtrack and actors. Really worth watching.",9,0,1,1 August 2014
