The Longest Yard," implants??
","Is it my imagination or why isn't anyone talking about the sudden growth in Courtney Cox's breasts that are very prominently displayed in this movie? She mysteriously went from an A cup in all of the previous roles that she has played since 1985, to a DD cup overnight in this uncredited role as Lena, Paul Crewe's wife. Does anyone have any official or unofficial information about this & why is the media uncharacteristically silent about this topic, considering that normally they would be stabbing each other in the back to be the first to report this kind of transformation, including publishing before and after pictures?",8,2,4,29 November 2005
