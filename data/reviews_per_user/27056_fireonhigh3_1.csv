Casablanca," What is so special?
","I specifically watched this movie because I had heard so many good things about it, most of them coming from imdb. I went into this movie expecting something good because of how many people (including my parents) said it was great and since it was up so high on the top 250 I had much confidence for it to be great.  I am only speaking honestly though when I say that it wasn't that good. I mean I guess I could say I enjoyed it and all. But I just don't see what everybody is so crazy about.  It had some good moments and all but what else was so good? I didn't even think Bogart was that good. This is the first Bogart movie I've seen though so maybe he has better performances. I just recently became interested in movies and I am trying to watch many of the really old greats.  I recently watched The Third Man, Ben-Hur, Gone With the Wind, and Lawrence of Arabia.  Comparing all of these to Casablanca, they are all better.  And Casablanca and Gone With the Wind are constantly feuded over and I have to say even though I didn't like the four hours of Gone With the Wind, it was still a better movie.  I mean I think saying number 6 is so wrong.  There is no way it could be number 6. But please I would like someone to e-mail and give me some of their thoughts and maybe we can talk just movies.Overall Rating for Casablanca: 7/10",7,2,8,29 June 2003
