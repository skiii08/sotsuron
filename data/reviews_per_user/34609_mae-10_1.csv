The Blair Witch Project," Spare us the over-analysis!
","PLEase...Watch the movie, take what you will from it, and discuss it. But enough already, I have talked to so many people who whine and complain about that it wasn't scary enough. OR those who try to over-analyse it and rave about the psychological impact of the twisted plot.I agree that the movie wasn't Especially frightening, but the way some people react to it is funny. Complaining about how we were so disappointed that it WASN'T REAL is ridiculous! Of COurse it's not real. It is a movie! That doesn't mean it is a bad movie just because it wasn't real, and you already KNEw that the noises weren't supernatural.I mean, come on  now, did you REally think that the spirits in The SHining existed...?Just take it for what it's worth, and allow yourself to be creeped out by the ending (the way it was meant to give you shivers). There are enough bad, cut-from-the-mold movies out there, that you can at least pretend to appreciate something innovative when it comes out. PLEASE don't encourage Hollywood to spell everything out for you.All I can say is that I'm glad this movie has raised so much controversy, maybe people will start to realize how typical most horror movies really are, and we'll get some more creative pieces.",Null,0,1,10 August 1999
