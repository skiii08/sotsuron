Antz," Antz vs. Bugs
","The first computer-generated feature from Dreamworks is ambitious indeed. Featuring a cast of A-list actors right down to the smallest supporting roles, it's a story that works in most areas and falls a little flat in just a few sections.  It's a well-written story with an ending that is just a little too neat and tidy.  Another MINOR quibble I had was that, with so many famous voices, I was sometimes distracted from the story by trying to guess whose voice I was hearing.Comparisons to Pixar's 'A Bug's Life' are inevitable, with supporters and detractors on both sides.  'Bugs' seemed targeted more on kids, but had an overall slickness in story and execution that seems lacking in 'Antz.' 'Antz' was a little more sophisticated in its humor and approach to realism, but a lot if it was dark.  Also, the visual style of the animation in 'Antz' seemed to be trying a little too hard.  The makers utilized a system of animation where the faces of the characters were given actual muscle systems to mimic the movement of human faces.  While technically admirable, the overall effect made it look like real faces were plastered onto computer figures and manipulated digitally -- it didn't look awfully real.  Of course, neither did 'Bug's Life', but 'Bugs' was from beginning to end a cartoon; it did not aspire to anything more lofty.  'Antz' did and fell short.But that's just me.  I could be wrong.",7,0,0,19 September 2000
Akira," The 'Die Hard' of Japanese anime
","For better or worse, 'Die Hard' is the benchmark with which most modern action-thrillers are compared.  You can see it in newspaper articles or reviews.  'Under Siege' was called 'Die Hard on a boat.'  'Speed' was dubbed 'Die Hard on a bus.'  'Sudden Death' was 'Die Hard in a hockey rink.'Well, 'Akira' is the 'Die Hard' of all Japanese anime.  I'm not an ardent follower of this genre, I must admit.  I like only a handfull of these films, and I own all but one of the ones I enjoyed (i.e., 'Wings of Honneamise', 'Ghost in the Shell', 'Princess Mononoke', and 'Akira').  The reason is simple, if not totally fair: every anime I see, I compare to 'Akira.'  And more often than not, they come up short in one area or another.  'Akira' represents, to me, a near-perfect synthesis of action, science-fiction, and high-end animation.  I've seen an awful lot of comparisons to 'Blade Runner', but the two films have little in common except the time in which they take place.  While 'Blade Runner' took its time with the storytelling, 'Akira' starts with the tachometer at the red line and rarely hits the brakes.  It's ultraviolent, semi-gross, and downright startling in places.  Anime just has no right being this good.",9,0,1,12 September 2000
Amistad," Moving, Stirring, Triumphant. 'Nuff said, yes?
","THESE COMMENTS CONTAIN POSSIBLE SPOILERS!  IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE, FOR GOD'S SAKE, PLEASE LOOK AWAY BEFORE YOUR RETINAS ARE SCORCHED BY THE LIGHT!What a stirring, emotional picture this is.  I'm sitting here trying to list all the different instances where I was genuinely moved.  Granted, there were one or two instances where Spielberg poured on the emotion so thick you almost choked on it; Cinque's 'Give...us...free!' scene is one of those overdone moments.  But overall, this is an incredibly vivid experience no serious movie fan should pass up.There are those who say the ending is so much of a downer that it put a damper on the entire film.  My response: while I certainly didn't feel warm and fuzzy after the last scene, I still felt I had seen something important. There are some scenes which are difficult to watch, as they should be.  But this should not dissuade anyone from giving this flick a shot.  It is moving and disturbing and ultimately, despite the ambiguous ending, triumphant.",8,0,1,18 September 2000
Alien," Nothing you haven't heard before.
","I'm afraid I have nothing new to offer for you avid readers of these comments.  I just wanted to add my two cents to the veritable goldmine of praise heaped upon this well-deserving classic.'Alien' is one of the last great classics of the seventies.  Even today, it doesn't seem dated.  Okay, the special effects for the climactic explosion look a little old...more like time-lapse photographs of moldy bread.  But the story holds up.  That's about it.  Good night.",8,0,1,12 September 2000
American Pie," Which is Funnier?
","What is it about this movie that makes it eligible for repeat viewing?  Why is it funny?  It's gross, sexist, lewd, crude, and many of the situations are socially unacceptable...definitely not a first-date flick.  But it's just so darn funny!  Why?  Why, why, why?Many comparisons have been made to 'Animal House', some favorable, most UNfavorable.  In my humble, rank amateur's opinion, this picture is superior.  There is no food fight, nor is there anyone who remotely approaches Belushi in terms of comic talent.  But the story is not as preposterous in 'American Pie.'  It stays real to the characters without having to resort to something that distracts from the main goal of the picture.  People in 'Pie' do wacky things, but you believe them.  People in 'Animal House' do wacky things, but there is no clear motivation.  Okay, these movies are not necessarily concerned with such mundane tasks as finding motivations for every action, but there was more of it in 'Pie' than there was in 'Animal House.'  Since it was more believable, it seemed more natural, and thus it was funnier because the characters were just being themselves without TRYING to be funny.  And since it's funnier, it's more watchable and eligible for repeat viewing.Then again, I could be wrong.  Though I doubt it.",8,0,0,15 September 2000
Armageddon," The Last Word.
","In a movie so concerned with showing how plausible its plot is...in a movie that goes out of its way to show scenes explaining in scientific detail what needs to be done and what is happening...in a movie with amazingly intricate special effects work...WHY DID THEY SHOW A FIRE BURNING IN THE VACUUM OF SPACE.  Whatever good points this movie may have had up to that point, the filmmakers lost me at that PRECISE instant.  Those of you who have seen it multiple times (you know who you are), you know the moment I'm talking about.  It's at some point after one of the shuttles crash-landed and the camera wanders over the wreckage...there's the flames and SMOKE.  C**p. C**p, c**p, c**p.  That's all I have to say about that.",3,0,1,2 October 2000
American Beauty," A Meandering Viewpoint
","THIS WILL PROBABLY CONTAIN SPOILERS, SO IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS FILM, GO AWAY.'American Beauty' has the capacity to move and amaze.  To watch this film and not be astonished and freaked out (to a degree) is to be partially dead inside.  Talking about ALL the great things in the movie would take days. Instead, allow me to expound on the ending.SECOND SPOILER WARNING.  IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM, BEGONE, SCAT, FLEE, RUN, RETREAT, RUN AWAY.Friends of mine have said the ending is a downer.  Far from it.  Think about what happens.  Lester is shot dead, and after a short shot of Caroline reacting, we get a series of shots with Lester's voice-over, explaining what went through his mind as he died.  Pictures from the past fill the screen, and he fondly recalls the memories that mattered the most.  Then he talks about becoming calm and relaxing and allowing the beauty of the world to pass freely through you until you become so full of beauty that you're about to burst.  Does this make sense?  'Don't worry,' he assures us, 'it will.'This humble fan found this ending sequence to be almost unbearably beautiful.  It reminded me that, where Lester's life is over, mine is stretched out in front of me.  How many chances will I squander before I come to his realization?  ('IT'S JUST...A...COUCH!!!')  How many opportunities will escape before I remember to reach out and grasp them? How many years will it take?  One?  Two?  Thirty?  Better do it soon.  The one year you decide to make the most of life might be your last.I could go on.  But I'm not going to.  If you've read this far, you know how I feel.  Take a moment.  Go outside.  Find something beautiful.  It's out there.  You just have to know how to look for it.  It's all around you. Within you.  Look closer.",10,0,0,14 August 2001
Apocalypse Now," Is it genius?
","What can you say about a film about which everything has already been said? Is it genius?  Is it a masterpiece?  Is it the definitive vision of the hell that was Vietnam?Yes...and no.Intrigued?  This film is certainly horrific.  The descent of a man, or men, into the chasm of insanity and inhumanity is certainly fine film fodder, and is handled extremely well by Coppola.  The only major director I can think of who could have handled this as well is Stanley Kubrick, who in fact made another fine war pic, 'Full Metal Jacket.'  It's a great subject...but not necessarily an EXCITING subject.  Don't get me wrong, the movie has a lot of relevant statements to make and makes them extremely well.  The conclusions drawn are haunting and logical in a twisted way; you know Kurtz is right, even though you don't want to believe it.But...You really have to let yourself get drawn in by the narrative.  This is a long, extended commentary on the black corners of the human heart.  Nothing is necessarily resolved; things just happen to the main characters, they react, and the audience forms their conclusions.  In any other film, this 'hands-off' approach might be viewed as laziness.  But Coppola weaves the story in such a way as to mesmerize you...provided you're in the right mood for it.  It is that fact that leads me to state this film is not really for everyone...which in my mind hinders it from being a true masterpiece. ...what was the question again?",9,0,0,21 September 2000
Being John Malkovich," A benchmark of 21st-century cinema
","...a bold statement, to be sure, especially coming from someone whose only credentials are the fact that he is a movie fanatic.  I am not a scholar.  I am not a professor, or an analyst, or an insider.  I talk about a movie's power to me personally, not to a demographic.  And I am here to tell you this film is brilliant.  It is inventive.  It is smart.  It is sharp.  It is bizarre and dark and mesmerizing in a few places.  It is truly unique and ingenius.And I am truly, deeply saddened by the many viewer comments that seem to overlook these qualities and instead comment on how they saw the film as murky or complex or insignificant.  I was especially depressed at how one user commented that Malkovich's performance in 'Con Air' was superior to his performance in THIS film.  Comparing this film with 'Con Air' is like comparing 'Alien' with 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes' and saying 'Killer Tomatoes' was a better monster movie.Please, I am eager to defend my views on this film; it is a masterpiece that will be remembered as a watershed for the film industry.  If you dissent, whether personally or professionally, I welcome the opportunity to try to change your opinion.",10,8,18,18 December 2000
Aliens," Unabashed Awe
","James Cameron's film of 'Aliens' is to the original 'Alien' what 'Godfather Part II' was to 'The Godfather.'  It's a film that is at least equal, and in some respects superior, to its predecessor.  The action is relentless, as is the suspense.  Even for jaded horror or sci-fi fans, this movie has plenty to offer.  If you have never seen this movie before, and you by chance happen to see it, and you do not jump at least five times during the film...if your stomach does not twist and churn with unbearable tension...if you still have fingernails left by the final scene...let me know, and I will eat my copy of the videotape.  Besides, I need it on DVD anyway.",10,0,0,14 September 2000
Dirty Dancing," A nadir of originality, but entertaining
","It's been several years since I last saw Dirty Dancing, and I can still remember the plot pretty well.  This is not because I read other reviews, or because it's one of my sister's favorite movies, nor is it because it's one of my girlfriend's favorite movies.  I remember the plot because it's the same basic plot the world has seen in countless other films like 'Cutting Edge' or 'Strictly Ballroom' or even 'The Karate Kid.'  Sure, there are some cosmetic differences, but scrape away the makeup and change a few locations and you've got the same flick, over and over and over again.Having said that, I will guiltily admit I enjoyed the film when I last saw it.  It entertained and held my interest in a way that I cared enough about the characters to want to see them succeed in the final dance competition. Of course, I was about sixteen.  You can draw your own conclusions from that last point.",3,0,6,12 September 2000
1941," For Spielberg aficianados only
","Okay.  Those of us who have seen this film are obviously divided into two groups: supporters and those who want to have the film killed by lethal injection.  One might say there is no way to have a middle-of-the-road viewpoint.  I submit that it is possible, because I have such a viewpoint.I don't hate this movie.  I don't love this movie.  I laugh at some parts of it.  I cringe at most parts of it.  The bit about Dan Aykroyd becoming shell-shocked is inspired.  The bit with Belushi's pants constantly squeaking because of his hidden toy is tedious.  The final motorcycle chase is finely choreographed mayhem.  The dance showdown is a chaotic, and worst of all BORING, mess.  The Japanese submarine crew is almost an insult to intelligent audiences everywhere, especially to those of Asian descent. The unnecessary toilet jokes with Slim Pickens.  The spectacular tracking shots with Belushi's fighter flying just yards above the city streets.  I love it. I hate it.  I can see what's wrong with it, but God knows how to fix it. I own it.  But I hardly ever watch it.I trust I have made myself obscure.",4,5,12,12 September 2000
Amadeus," I have a lot to say...
","This is one of those movies I can watch again and again and still be enthralled, mystified, and amazed every time.  I admit I may be biased because I am a lover of classical music, but I am also a lover of great cinema, and this is one of the greatest examples of modern cinema.  I may be biased also because, like Salieri, I too can recognize genius in music, acting, and even writing, and I sometimes grow envious and bitter as I watch undeserving hacks grow rich while the only way I can get published is to write little comments for IMDb.There is so much I could say about the underlying truths in this film about the disparity between those of us who struggle to reach above-average status and those who reach superstar-status without breaking a sweat.  But I won't. Chances are not a lot of people will read this review that necessarily care about that aspect of the film.  This is not a slam on fellow members; you wouldn't have become a member if you didn't care about good film.  But many of my views are so personal I can't express them without losing my objectivity.  Suffice to say this is a classic, not to be missed, and if anyone wants to hear my REAL comments on the deeper issues, answer me by clicking on the link above.  I have a lot to say...",10,2,4,14 September 2000
2001: A Space Odyssey," Turn on your thinking caps
","Yes, the film is slow.  Yes, there is hardly any dialogue.  Yes, the opening sequence is strange, cryptic, and contains NO dialogue.  Yes, the ending reveals nothing.  No, the ending is not climactic in the traditional sense. Yet this is hailed as THE masterpiece of modern science-fiction cinema. Why?I suspect most of the detractors of this film, particularly those represented by some of these user-comments, forgot to do one thing before watching the film: turn their thinking caps to the 'ON' position.  This is not the voice of someone jumping on the artsy-film bandwagon.  This is the voice of someone who did some serious thinking about the events of the film. Why would the director include this shot or that bit of dialogue?  It's like that scene from 'Close Encounters'; the more you think about it, the more you realize that this MEANS something, this is IMPORTANT.  If the thought that human evolution might have been instigated by an alien consciousness doesn't make you look at the stars with increasing wonder, you're not thinking hard enough.  And if you're a serious filmgoer at any level, and you didn't like the film the first time, you owe it to yourself to watch it again.  This time, turn your thinking cap on.",8,0,2,12 September 2000
The Terminal," Spielberg and silliness
","I don't ask for much in a movie. All I want is to care about the characters and what happens to them. That's all. Not every movie can do that, no matter how hard it tries. People wept while watching 'Big Fish'; I thought, 'If I were stuck next to Albert Finney's character on a train, I'd weep, too.' That is to say, I didn't care. Maybe I'm a hardcase, or maybe not; I wept at the end of 'Edward Scissorhands.' Go figure.Now here is 'The Terminal' with Tom Hanks in his most likable role, in my opinion, since Forrest Gump. Some have said he's TOO likable. 'The movie is too formulaic.' 'Too silly.' 'Sappy.' 'Too sweet.' 'Not up to Spielberg's best.' You know what? Not all of Spielberg's movies can be 'Schindler's List.' Or 'E.T.' What you have here is a movie that made me remember what it was like to have a good time at the movies and leave feeling good about the world in general. This movie was literally a breath of fresh air amid the noxious fumes of hate and war and fear that pervade our society nowadays. Too silly? What's wrong with a silly movie every now and then, AS LONG IT MAKES YOU CARE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS? I don't mean 'Scooby-Doo' silly; I'm talking 'Say Anything...' silly.I found myself caught up in Viktor's world and the friends he made in the terminal. I was moved when he explained to Amelia why he carries that damn peanut can around. I was moved again when Gupta selflessly provides a (possible) way for Viktor to leave the terminal. I found myself physically rooting for Viktor when he arranges a private dinner date for Amelia on the 'terrace.' What else can you wish for in a film? I have but one complaint. As moved as I was by his romance with Amelia, I didn't think it was absolutely necessary. The story was involving enough without throwing a love story into the mix. But Spielberg makes it work well enough that I didn't care too much.All of this is to say: Do yourself a favor and rent 'The Terminal.' Unless you're an incurable humbug who thinks Spielberg should stick to war movies and nothing else, in which case this movie will do nothing for you. For everyone else, check it out. Come on. It'll be fun. Remember fun?",9,1,2,19 April 2005
Apollo 13," Do you really need ME to tell YOU this?
","Well...um...where to start?Tom Hanks, looking like he was shooting for a three-peat, three years in a row being nominated for the Best Actor Oscar, didn't get it.  Did he deserve it?  If Mel Gibson had only waited a year before releasing 'Braveheart', he would have been a lock.  Also, this is, above all, an ensemble picture.  But you don't need me to tell YOU that, you already KNOW that.  Right? So...next.The special effects.  If you don't already know, many of the zero-gravity shots in this flick were accomplished by constructing a set of the space capsule inside what's known as the 'Vomit Comet', a modified jet aircraft designed to simulate weightlessness for astronaut training.  What it does is simple: it flies up to a high altitude very fast, then gradually turns earthward at just enough speed to make whatever is inside of the jet 'float' off the ground, thus creating a weightless effect.  Not too impressive, right?  Except the actors, directors and other crew members made between 500 and 600 individual flights on the 'Vomit Comet' to get all the required shots.  But you already know THAT.  Don't you?The story.  It's kinda like watching 'Titanic.'  You KNOW the boat sinks, you just wanna see how it's DONE.  Same here.  Ron Howard, director extraordinaire, tightens the story and ratchets up the tension so we are prepared to either bawl our eyes out or stand up and cheer at the end...and either way would be equally as satisfying.But you don't need ME to tell YOU this...do you?",9,0,0,21 September 2000
Aladdin," Random Thoughts on 'Aladdin'
","Just watched this recently, on the new-and-improved DVD which features a restored print, and it looks spectacular. The story is slightly shallower than the best of Disney's films, but this is balanced by the sheer lunacy of Robin Williams' bad, blue Genie. Whoever first thought of putting Robin Williams in a Disney flick should get a Pulitzer, or a Nobel, or something. The comic timing of his riffs combined with the comic timing of the animators transform the Genie from a 'Deus Ex Machina' into the soul of 'Aladdin.'I have a tiny issue with the fact that the most recent VHS and DVD prints of the movie have bowed to pressure from activist groups and altered a line in the opening song. The original line was, '...where they cut if your ear if they don't like your face/It's barbaric, but hey, it's home.' The revised line reads, '...where the land is immense and the heat is intense/It's barbaric, but hey, it's home.' Protesters claimed the original line perpetuated a negative stereotype of Arab countries and peoples. But...but...but marketplaces and cities in Arabian countries still cut the hands off convicted thieves. And there's even a scene in the film which threatens to relieve the princess of an appendage. They're not being negative; they're being accurate. And, oh yeah, IT'S A CARTOON. But that's just my opinion.",8,77,117,15 June 2005
