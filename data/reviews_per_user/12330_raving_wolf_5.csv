Minority Report," A Futuristic Masterpiece
","I'm not gonna tell ya about the story, just read some of the other comments or preferably, watch the movie....i just wanted to say Minority Report deserves all the praise in the world. The acting and directing is magnificent and the SFX are believable. 
although, after watching it a few times, which, sadly, i'm inclined to do, there are some problems with the story you tend not to notice because the movie is always going forward.  I am disapointed however, that the real criminal is exposed so early.  This movie had the makings of a great Mystery and in one scene, it is all taken away and some of the fun is taken away with it.  But that put aside, this movie is the futuristic joyride that The Star Wars prequels are supposed to be.  Somebody should take lessons.",8,0,0,1 January 2003
X-Men," wow
",having been a fan of the x for years and awaiting this film since forever i am more than content with it.  it blew me away and even though there were some flaws in the story line and characters it all pulled together to make an astounding sci-fi flick that made me remember the good old days of staying up late and reading the latest of the x-men tales...i will definately be waiting for a sequel and who knows maybe they will bring back the generation x television series.,10,0,0,21 July 2000
Resident Evil," Creepily fantastic
","first of all i must admit that i am an avid resident evil player and was skeptic of this film at first, yet still anticipated its release.After walking out of the theatre i was astonished.  I remembered the days when video games first came to the big screen.  I remember the disapointment following such flops as Super Mario Bros., and Street Fighter.  But then there was the satisfaction of Mortal Kombat (not the sequel which sucked hard core) and Final Fantasy: the spirts within.Resident Evil falls in line with Mortal Kombat.  The origional story is kept in tact except for a few details that had to be added to make the movie work.I enjoyed the movie tremendously, in fact a few scenes totally creeped me out, just like the game does, while playing it alone, in a dark room with the volume turned way up.  Although it will always be a trend setting classic, i believe that Resident evil is totally the Night of the living dead of the 2000's...there has not been a great zombie movie since then until now.Recommended to sci-fi fans and gamers alike, and if you haven't tried the game yet and liked the movie, i suggest you get with it.  Both the game and the movie are edge of your seat fright fests that will definately get your heart racing.",10,0,0,9 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," I NEED MORE
","i rarely give ten stars to any movie, but i had to.  I was so astounded and amazed during this entire movie that i felt i would cry at any moment as if witnessing a miracle.  For almost three hours shivers shot down my spine...you know the ones.if the third movie in the saga is any better than this one i am going to have to stop going to the movies, cuz my expectations are gonna be higher than god.watch it....love it.and for all you hard core fans who didn't like any of the changes from the book....get over it...it's a movie.  If you want things exactly the same read the book again.",10,0,0,22 January 2003
Bring It On," K I C K A * * that's the way we spell success!
","yes this movie was fun and entertaining and well choreographed and pleasing to the eye and a whole slew of other compliments...I agree with everyone else on this point and suggest that if you want to see a real feel good movie and want to walk out of the theatre ready to rule the world..go see BRING IT ON.however, on another level, this film is not all it is cracked up to be.  It is fun, but that's about it.  The dialogue was lacking in sincerety and the 'witty repertoire' lacked the luster that Cat Strafford (Julia Styles) gave in 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU.  Even though Kristen Dunst and her mob of teen cheerleaders tried to spew out over-intellegent jibes, they were corny and often out of place.  It was as if they were trying to overemphasize the witty dialogues that made CLUELESS and 10 THINGS...popular.  The one line that bugged me the most was...' are you trying to tell me you speak fluent in fag.'  This is not only STUPID, but who in their right mind would say something like this to a friend especially when that person is having a hard time coping with their sexuality...not very realistic.If the characters said less and performed more, this would have been a better movie.  The characters were real, they had feelings and emotions that reprsented well what we all felt in High School.  Everyone gave great performances. I loved it...but seriously, nobody talks like that in high school unless they want to get beaten.",7,0,0,15 October 2000
