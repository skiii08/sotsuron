Ford v Ferrari," Fell flat
","Racing unrealistically slow, car movements all wrong, exaggerated acting, too long, predictable. Proud American sort of Vietnam war movie feel.Wanted to like it. Some good scenes. Rather shocked by how most seemed to love it. We are all different, aren't we!",4,4,9,30 January 2020
First Man," Wasted chance.
",More about the wife and her emotions. Time on noon 2 minutes or so. Time in quarantine longer. Total anticlimactic film. Wasted chance. Good acting but simple and seen before. Totally disappointing.,2,2,3,21 February 2019
Rocketman," Perfect
","Even in an understated way, perfect. The best movie I've personally seen in years. See it on the big screen. Terrific.",10,3,7,13 September 2019
The Irishman," Boring, slow, Hardly anything new.
","Some moments of originality, suspense and fun. Overall a bore and self-indulgent. How can they justify the time out of their lives and money it takes to make movies..... when they're this lackluster!",3,3,12,30 November 2019

Edge of Tomorrow," Mostly disappointed.
","Good storyline and tight continuity, but too much silly shooting and climax in the dark. First half worth watching.",4,0,4,12 November 2018
Da 5 Bloods," Utterly predictable, tiresome....
","Trite, vapid, meaningless, boring.Can't imagine why anyone would bother going to all the effort of making these cheap dramas.Why must black people be portrayed as being so easily enraged and making one silly decision after another.Wanted to like it.Astonishingly bad.",2,3,5,22 June 2020
