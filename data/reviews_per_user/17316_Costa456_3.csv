Angels & Demons," Surpasses Da Vinci Code by far
","I went to see this film on opening night, not expecting much because I was somewhat disappointed with Da Vinci Code. I had read both books and already after with DVC's outcome, I was nervous with Angels and Demons.Let me just start off by saying that I think they should have gotten a new script writer rather than Akiva Goldsman. Seriously, he did a bad job of adapting DVC so why bring him back? It pleased me tho to see David Koepp who is more of an action script writer than anything. In the first 15 minutes of the film, you can tell that the tone is different from DVC and is a little more fast paced. The acting is somewhat a little better and so is the dialog(I'm assuming thats Koepps input). The story has been tweaked which bothered me but not to an extent where I wanted to walk out.After the first hour, I was already saying to myself that this film FAR SURPASSES Da Vinci Code. Ron Howards directing is sharper and the score of the film really makes your adrenaline spike with the thrilling scenes.Ewans portrayal of the Cameralngo was really good and the rest of the cast did what was expected of them. The cinematography was excellent and all the sets were superb. The story itself was pretty good although it could have been so much better. All in all, the film was a pretty good adaptation although I think they should really get a new script writer",8,4,7,19 May 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Oh My God. What did we do to deserve this piece of garbage?
","Just as Marc Foster should stick to dramas, Gavin Hood should stick to what hes good rather than direct this messy action movie. X-Men Origins is by far the WORST superhero movie I have ever seen (Yes, even worse than Spider Man 3). The movie is riddled with plot holes and the story is just so bland and boring that I couldn't really get into it. We already know so much about Wolverine from the previous X-Men films so why make an Origin film? Hugh Jackman was prob the only actor in the film that demonstrated talent while the others were wasted! Seriously, Ryan Renolds was in the film for a total of 5-10 minutes! And if that wasn't bad enough, we hardly see the Blob or Gambit. You would think they learned they're lesson by putting to many characters in X3 but looks like they did it again. By all means, avoid this film. The effects are about the only thing that is good about it....everything else just falls flat and fails",1,1,6,19 May 2009
District 9," 'Watch Out This One Is A Little Sharper Than The Others'
","District 9...WOW what a ride! I went to see a midnight screening of this film and was blown away. Just like the line Wilkus says in the movie when they find out that will be harder to evict Christopher out of his house, District 9 is a smart Sci-Fi movie that beats all the sci fi action blockbusters this summer. The action is phenomenal and the story is excellently paced and structured. All the acting by the unknowns are really great and the excellent transition from documentary style in the beginning to narrative is excellent! I could go on and on about this movie but frankly, this is a movie you have to witness for yourself. You have to experience District 9 to feel the excitement and buzz around this film. Everyone telling you its good wont do any good until you have actually seen this great film.",10,8,16,14 August 2009
