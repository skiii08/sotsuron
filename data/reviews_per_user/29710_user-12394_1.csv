Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A laugh a minute
","If you are easily offended don't go to see this movie...but boy oh boy it is a laugh a minute practically, if you can look at life and laugh at how people really can be you will enjoy it...not going to say anything about it except, sit back, relax, watch you don't spray your soda on the people in front:-) when you are hooting with laughter..I would see it again, guess there are bits that I missed the first time round. It is just fun all the way! I didn't realize until afterward that the people he 'interviews' are real..the expressions on some faces are to die for, and the answers given could not have been scripted better if there had been a script for these people!",8,2,8,4 November 2006
