Us," Connisueurs of Horror Movies, DON' Miss This One
","We never pay extra for the early releases, but we did this time because we loved Peele's 'Get Out' and my son just couldn't wait any longer to see it.We absolutely loved this flick... Peele didn't let us down. A thinking mans Horror Movie with great foreshadowing, tense lead ups to well planned 'scares'.. Arcs from beginning to end so watch it all closely from the opening minutes till the very last. You have to watch it till the last moment to get it. I'm sure many won't, I took a couple of early guesses and I called it. I actually made my guess in jest since it was early in the movie and a real reach... I'm not a huge horror fan but this was well worth my two hours and $15. I plan to watch it again, something I rarely do. You won't be disappointed! The 6.9 rating is low. Look to the critic reviews which are spot on for a change.",8,0,0,7 July 2020
The Irishman," 'A Cool $159,000,000 to produce..'
","Was it really worth it...' Abso-cocksuckin'-lutely.'What a great critic review. If you want to read real critical acclaim, check out the real critics.. all linked here to IMDb!Much better intellectual reviews than the goobers like us who review on here... LOL .. Abso......
Hilarious sentiment, but in all seriousness there are some really good reviews for a fantastic film! Critics do their best when reviewing a fabulous movie. They fall asleep in the bad ones...",10,1,3,4 December 2019
Deadpool 2," Once Upon a Deadpool
","Currently streaming on your favorite service is the movie named 'Once upon a Deadpool'. But when you search that title here on IMDB or anywhere else for that matter... what shows up is the title, 'DEADPOOL 2' from the search. The reason for this is because both titles are the same movie... DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY to watch 'Once upon a Deadpool'... because it's exactly the same movie as ' Deadpool 2'.. with the exception of a few changes from the original making it less bloody and violent. IMDB FANS SHOULD KNOW THIS and if you've seen '2' then DON'T waste your money to see the same movie over as I did. And I fault my tv provider for not making that clear, so hopefully the rest of you will find out from my post before you waste $5.99 to see the same movie you've already seen not long ago except many important parts are missing. Don't waste your money. Sure if you want to see the original again rent it, but don't rent this one. What a clever trick by the producers to attempt to squeeze a few more million $ from the movie, but because of this, ill not watch a third Deadpool movie. I don't like being duped and there should've been an obvious disclaimer accompanying the marketing and information for this altered version. A shame too because I liked the two original movies, but this is pure greed and nothing else and they'll not get another of my $'s.",8,1,3,3 February 2019
A Quiet Place," Scary, captivating, but I wasnt't gripping my hands
",A 6 is best I can do. Im usualy a vey liberal rater but it was very slow at times and the scary parts were in my opinion 'not in your face' close enough. Couldve donr a lot more with it.,6,0,3,14 July 2018
Parasite," A must watch...
","I started to rent on Demand several times because of the high meta score rating of 96 but the fact it was sub-titled made me change my mind several times. Finally my 19 yr old son who rarely watches movies, especially sub-titled came to me and wanted to rent it... so we did and wow what an interesting evening. We were fascinated from the first few minutes and never was there a dull moment. Great acting, great story and a very very well directed movie!A great night of entertainment!!!!",9,4,9,15 February 2020
Midway," Damn, Damn Good Movie!
