Requiem for a Dream," Breathtakingly real
","Aronofsky has creating a cinematic masterpiece that portrays addiction and substance abuse in a stunningly horrid, yet painfully accurate depiction, something that no other filmmaker has fully accomplished.",10,0,0,10 April 2018
Suicide Squad," Predictable and Cheesy
","Nothing unique or original at all about this. Every line of every scene seemed as if it has been in every past superhero movie ever made. All in all, bland film lacking any genuine character.",4,0,0,11 April 2018
