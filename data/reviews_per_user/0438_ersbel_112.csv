The Lobster," European Socialist meets US Prude
","And once more the European tax payer becomes a film producer with no way to opt out. The result is a slow, Euro style movie in which the strict Socialism of Europe meets the US prude attitude. 'They' will provide you everything, but you still get to keep your ugly underwear as not to offend the governmental commission. The extras play with the dignity of the Union worker. The story also has the air of Union contracts. Like with most European films, the story is for 30-40 minutes, blown up to what the governmental commission asked for the run time. But the story is that bad it keeps needing the god voice to explain the empty frames.Finally, a successful, unpolished film student movie. You have the blue filter when the audience needs a cue it's a cold, impersonal scene. You have the red filter when it should be a personal scene. You have the Kaurismaki rip off scene and all the rest they teach in film school.",Null,0,6,22 January 2020
Blade Runner 2049," Scientistic mysticism
","Lately I amuse myself with imagining the angry European mob when they would have discovered a witch. The poor things are stupid, hungry, and their animal slaves are starting to die. They would eat the corpses, but they are too afraid to enjoy the meat and think of the 'street value' of the milk. And now they are ready to do some human sacrifice, although they talk about a merciful god who tortured and killed his own son.Now they wield smart phones. And drive fast cars. And they are not hungry. And they are clearly smarter. But the instincts are the same. Their instincts honed in millions of years living like any other beast under rain and snow are useless. And they feel the stress even with all the comfort of the modern world. So they are ready for human sacrifice again. Ecology. The planet is a suffering god asking for blood. They need suffering and penance. Plastic straws. Too much screen time. Anything one can regularly do can be an offense to the immaterial gods of safety and good health.P.K. Dick's story was simple: how about a human who is ignorant of the fact that it is not human? Where do you draw the line? A nice speculation for someone who needed a lot of chemicals to stay lucid. This story is an ugly speculation about souls and about machines that need company without being programmed. And this comes from some creative writing graduates who could not do math to save their lives.Denis Villeneuve is good. And there is only so much he can do to this horrible primitivist tale.",Null,0,8,6 January 2019

Nothing special. Still, they know something that makes them gain all those money. No useless characters. No excessive use of extras. The camera is the one used flawlessly in Grand Hotel Budapest.

Catch Me If You Can," A disgustingly moralistic story from a rather fun book
","This is a disgustingly moralistic story. And what makes things more unpleasant is that the book was pleasant.The book was about the fun the guy had. He never stole. In a way he can be the emblem of any left leaning government: stealing from the rich to make the life better for those poorer than the rich. He is not violent. He is not a clownish serial killer turned forger. Yet the character in the movie does just that: leaving trails and taunting the smart cop.And the cop was not in the original story. The cop is pasted. And it turns out the cop is the actual character of the story. He is nice. Not only he does not beat the hardened criminal, but he spends his time trying to free him and give him a job and we can assume the path to a regular life. The cop is moral and just. He does not spend government money unless it is to safeguard the rights of a criminal. He spends his free time away from his family to work. He is almost a saint.And the adventure? There is no adventure. Only a fatherly law enforcer that rehabilitates a criminal. What about the European trip?

Spartacus," Hard to understand why SK would associate his name with this
","Truly I find it almost impossible to understand why Kubrik signed this junk. Eyes Wide Shut was not his, but he had no power to oppose the studio decision because he was not alive at the time of the release. But why Spartacus?Take the opening scene which I'm not even sure it's his. The audience can see Ustinov coming with a black man. We know he is a slave because the outstanding racism. After all African men could be citizens in Ancient Rome, but not on the pure American screens. Now, the black man holds an umbrella only for himself as the shadow is only over him. Should this imply that the Roman slave owners were so stupid as not to direct the slave or only the director was so stupid not to notice that? Probably it was because the African man was too sensitive to be exposed to so much suffering going on and the slave owners were such animals that they did not feel the need for such a disguise.Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch The above just happen after a KD who stops working before the very eyes of three Roman guards, than drops his load, under the caring eyes of the same guards and only after he starts helping up another slave they interfere.

Gravity," Cute, in a sea of advertising
","This movie can be cute. But it is lost in a sea of advertising. This is not about a strong woman. This is about a loser. A loser who somehow got into the space program. There is nothing heroic about the character. Just trying to survive like any other animal would. In a very unlikely context. But it's a space drama, right? The two character cast can be very powerful. Yet the result is slow and dull. Meaning a weak script.

The Big Lebowski," A decent movie when there's no Tarantino on TV
","I have seen this movie back when it was released. I remember being entertained, but not impressed. Over the years some images have stick into the mind, but what this movie is about has completely faded. So, thanks to NetFlix, I said to myself: why not burn two hours and see that story with a fresh eye.The movie is entertaining and, thanks of it unmemorable story, I kept watching to see what next. Overall, a good description would be 'a Tarantino script at the second or third draft'. Way too many pointless characters that would make sense in a TV series script to help with the second, third and fourth season.

Star Trek," The cheap TV series now gets a budget
","This was a cheap TV series. People living in those days were starved for entertainment so Star Trek became smart and creative. Never mind racism, paternalism and the wide faced farm boy Kirk knowing it all like a demigod. Now there's a reboot. And it is just as good, only with a nice budget to appeal to the current generation. It is the same paternalistic, racist and anthropocentric junk, only this time you get more variation. They all look like humans, but when Kirk was young there were at least ten times more species going around. Which makes the old, some say original, series even worse. And the script?

Fight Club," I rated it a 10. I read the book, I give it a 4 (mostly because of Ed Norton)
","I was impressed by the movie. Dark without being overdone. Bothering to say some stuff. Making some use of the lack of talent shown by Mr. Pitt. Everything seemed so good for a Hollywood production. Yet, something bothered me: Mr. Fincher. He does some moody music videos which compliment the music. This is what he has done in Fight Club also - set the mood and the tempo. Yet, all his other pieces longer than 10 minutes stink beyond the visuals. How come? A director so big and fails short of his objectives? So I finally got myself up to read the book. I read the book. And, in the beginning, there's no director. It's only an illustration of the book - pretty much the same way some nobody is given some out-of-copyright classical novel to direct as a commission from some family TV channel. In the end, the director is nothing than a assistant producer. Once the story in the novel unfolds the changes are more profound. The same way butcher Scott gutted a Ph. K. Dick novel to give a love story in some sort of distant dystopia covered all in the aspartame of SFX, Fincher and his team do bother to tame down the story, everything below the shallow philosophy is ironed out. The only thing that team can be proud of is pulling up that ending that would have been impossible to get past censorship a few years later. But, at the time, there was nothing so special about it, only dumbing down the ending to make sure the silly happy end where hero gets the girl and nothing really happened.Norton does a good job, that would account for about 3 points, and the fourth is because of the smooth integration of the visuals and soundtrack. Only one point for that last one as it's nothing too hard, even Peter Jackson can do it.Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch",Null,0,2,9 April 2011

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A very nice rehash of episode iv
","So Lucas tried to update his ugly muppets and restored the original series. But it seems they needed Disney to bring the visuals up to date. So you have about the same story line. With about the same decors. Luke's planet is a desert (talking about a simplistic approach), this time it looks like Ireland. Luke is on a remote farm, farming sand as we can see. Here they are farming moss for unknown reasons. But everything is about the same, only looking better. As usual the physics are cheap comic style version, meaning if you can draw it, than this is how it happened. This way a shuttle leaving can blow anybody alive over the landing dock, but not the dead. Which makes perfect sense as the dead can't hold on one hand over the abyss.As usual, the story is not the best part of a Star Wars movie. And the dialogue is also way below the story. Which does not mean this is not better than most of the movies in the series so far. And I do appreciate the toning down of the comic character.Actually, there is nothing beyond the visuals. Probably this is an overall issue with the rigidity of Hollywood in general. An advanced civilization that can cross the universe and build these huge ships, some sort of transport cities. Yet, people battle with swords and people are in badly need of mobile phones. Well, maybe the roaming is excessive. The military strategy is a bit beyond the Napoleonic Wars, yet certainly below 1914. With laser weapons, the best Lucas' team could imagine back in 1977. As for communication, they can do cross galaxy radio, yet moving data needs some homing pigeons.Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch",Null,2,4,31 March 2017

Iron Man 2," Amusing, yet uneven
","This is an amusing movie. And a good past time. Like most movies in the MCU, the quality is above average. Still, the script is stitched from many stories by many people so the end result is patchy.Rourke is a very nice villain. But a physicist that can do hacking like a whole enterprise and still he can DIY a high tech costume and source of energy, all this after 20 years of pampering in a Russian prison.But usually the choices are far worse than Rourke's character. This way, it's the black guy that steals, that serves his masters and betrays his friend. And as far as I can recall the only black guy.Or the Johanson character: the wet dream of any military leader who can't get an erection.Or the Paltrow character that is an incompetent that can do things, yet everything was done so she could take a maternity leave and breed many white Iron Men.Or the non-descript other villain that has contracts with the military, yet his is afraid of being taken into custody by the police.

","So we already have The Running Man, Battle Royale, but somebody had to come up with this one. In books it is even worse, as there are many other books in the same spirit that are way better. And to compensate for the bad script: deus ex machina. Just because it is a kiddie fantasy one can do everything, even manipulate the terrain just to make teams meet and fight.And really? The Hunger Games? With kids so fat, pardon me, strong? First it is shown as going into the wilderness is forbidden, now all have survival skills because of the crash course before the show? Is impressive to have a strong female character? It would be. Only the strong female character is a peasant virgin maiden. She does not look strong, she looks ready to start a family next to a strong man. And what about the rest? The show is just going on as a way to paint the apparent strong characters.

Zootopia," I was expecting another Plains, I got an excellent film
","I see the publicity in supermarkets and I think to myself this must be another Plains with the race background scraped and a cops and robbers theme pasted over. This film is nothing like that. It has a well developed story, characters that have their own personalities, although some of the smaller roles are filled by stock characters. And the best of it: the main characters do evolve. Overall the film is fun, although there are some tense moments that might scare younger children.I discovered only after the film how long it is, but at no moment I felt the need to check how long till the end, which is not easy predictable as most Disney productions.

Terminator Salvation," Quake meets Matrix 3 leading to some sort of Starship Troopers
","Hollywood logic: to fight an army of T1000 (too expensive to feature in this movie) you also need an army of shape-shifters. This way Connor and Reese can and should change in time both in size and also the face, after all the human resistance is some sort of Witness Protection System - we've all seen Arnold locate someone by the picture alone. And if Batman changed bodies from one movie to another so does J Connor.And it keeps getting better and better. At least better than Alice in Wonderland. This is the Candy land. Where you don't have oil extraction facilities, no refineries, yet gas is everywhere. There are no factories around, yet everybody has a high-caliber gun, proper gun training and a little bit of sharp-shooter classes. There are no fields and the land is at least as poisonous as now, yet hunger is unknown. And the resistance is multiplying like rats in order for the machines to kill at that rate. Eh, in this fairy-tale land even terminators seem easier to terminate although they are larger than the models than can travel through time.Bottom line I guess the only reason why a resistance composed only of half-wits survives is because of outsourcing.

Zodiac," Cheating the viewer
","After seeing Seven, I wanted more of Fincher misled by the general perception that the director is the key person involved in developing a story. The delays in production made the film more tempting, yet at a certain point I have lost interest and forgot about it.It is a long, slow, and mostly boring movie. Almost 3 hours to reach no conclusion. And to fill up the time, you have speculations and fantasy related with the dead victims. A work of fantasy sold as true story. Yet every story injected leads to bam! bam! all dead.Like a Lord of the Rings movie, Fincher makes an elf story. Sure, the costume is a high fidelity reproduction of a drawing. Was the guy like that? Maybe he was wearing a clown costume like in Stephen King's It. Here, like in It or Lord of the Rings, the shown reality blends seamlessly with imagination.And the backdrops? Each and every one looks like some vintage post card or magazine advert from the 1960s. All I could see was Fincher's old man nostalgia and an absurdly big budget. The story is not helped.

Moana," A feminist remake of Hercules
","I found this idea to remake Hercules in a feminist key spectacular. I had more fun watching Hercules. And I have liked more the songs. Even the voice cast was better there. But this is finally a good departure from the breeder princess helpless in need of a man to rescue her and do adult stuff after the movie has ended.The script has holes. Not as big as I am used to see coming from what's labeled as Hollywood, but still, all the magic in the movie still can't cover them. Sure, after training with a demi-god, Moana can make a speedboat out of an wooden raft with sail. But her father wanted her away from the water. So how come she is able to sail so well a boat that is far more difficult to steer than the modern catamaran? How come she can swim so well with her father not letting her near the water. And if the ocean is so decided to keep her in the game, why do we even bother with a boat? Just to have the silly chicken keep falling off? And this one corrects the Teutonic standard of femininity so embraced by the late Walt Disney at the same time as adding some variety to the panel of existing princesses. But this is not Zootopia. The message is zero besides having a strong woman character. The gags are lower in quality and further apart.

The Expendables," The contribution of the retirement home to war propaganda
","Back in the days of 2000 and something it was required to have the people understand terrorist can be anyone and nobody can feel safe. Enough of the news portrait of the turban wearing madman with explosive belt or shoes! Movies like Deja Vu with Denzel Washington were important to remind nobody is safe. Even in a racially cleansed world without darkies', there are still terrorists. And for that there is a screaming need to have a video surveillance camera and at least one TV screen in every room.Now the times have changed. People feel less the threat of turban, mask, cape, whatever madmen and more the issues of not being able to pay the new bank rate or facing unemployment. Health care and pension seem to be back as more important than the presidential urine samples. So, in these days of weakening faith, hallelujah, the ancients have written, you either bring up a Holy Inquisition and burn people at stake or push the bread and circus up to new levels. In this case, the grave digger producers have raided the retirement home to make another All Star movie, the sure bet for any large studio. They're larger, they're older, they're slower than ever. But the kids have animatronics. So what they barely move, they can't keep their eyes open or the mouth is half paralyzed? We can hire a guy in a green suit to move them like a puppeteer, we can get a video guru to cut up frames like a sushi chef and here's the result: a weird boxing zombie Bruce Lee in the stuffed skin of heroes a few decades old.

Shutter Island," I used to see Scorsese as magic
","Growing up I used to see Scorsese as magic. And he is only a director who had the chance, and maybe some inspiration, to choose the box office hits from all the projects he received. In the case of Shutter Island, is the script that does the magic. Scorsese just directs people according to the given script. DiCaprio? Well, it would have been much better if he could act. But, as usual, Leo DiCaprio only moves around the set with a blank expression. Like any puppet he moves around, she can open the mouth and tell the lines and that is about it. Actually, thanks to the demigod director, most actors are in the same state and unless for the realism, one might think this is an animation project. Max von Sydow is the only one acting, but that is maybe because he is too old to be directed by the mighty Scorsese. And the role is small.It is also interesting to see the transformation of Scorsese in the light of his exposure to the Asian film makers. He is trying color filters and enhancers. It would have been nice to have these variations back in the days of Goodfellas. Still, it is only an experiment and it looks like one as the color variations are cute, but add nothing to the story itself.So I have enjoyed the script and not much else.Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch",Null,0,0,27 November 2016

Ant-Man," An entertaining action movie
","Ant Man is entertaining. Sure, the story needs some ignorance and a lot of mental gymnastics, but the end result is quite pleasant. This is a typical movie: action, some back story, comic characters to light up the mood. In the end I think it is better than Star Wars and there are no Nazi images. Sadly, only for brainless action. Because once you look at the story and the pseudo scientific explanations things are starting to stink. And it probably can't be any different. The characters were started up by a few uneducated young men trying to make a living. Action was and still is their deal and all the rest, like a reasonable explanation, are just barriers wasting their precious time in churning more comics. They were formed in the Cold War scare and probably the World War was very close for the people around them. So the stories are extremely violent, involve a lot of gun powder - that was modernized to lasers later - and morality means the main character says something along the lines of 'it's good for the nation.'

Nightcrawler," A good story that fizzes into a moralist stand
","Nightcrawler is a good story that fizzes into a moralist stand. I have known since the first ten minutes that it is going to be a moralist film. And I also have had a feeling the script was made by someone completely ignorant of the issue at hand based on some sensationalist blog post read sometime. And this is what Nightcrawler is: a statement against the evil media that holds 'us' hostages. Because there is always an us and a them at the base of any conspiracy.I have enjoyed for a totally different reason: the good representation of someone who can break the glass ceiling. Surely, the script writer is disgusted and demonizes the character who is presented as a freak and certainly in need of a straight jacket. But up to the final point you can see the guy who works his a** off to succeed in a world of closed doors.Also the representation of the media is quite right up, again, to the end when there is the preach. It is a form of entertainment. White people have the internet, friends, money and time to travel, DVDs, books, things you need a few lifetimes just to index. There is a personal and direct choice to consume scary TV instead of a soap opera or an XMen movie. Each gives thrills, only different kind of thrills.And I loved the visuals. The HDRs are a sign of those new digital cameras that can 'see' what humans don't. Probably many movies from now on will use this kind of images. So this is no merit for Nightcrawler.Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch",Null,0,1,28 November 2016

","I have no idea how the comic book original was, but I find it hard to believe that lesbian sex and karate were featured there at that time in the puritanical America. Yet the visuals are quite special, almost nearing the productions coming out of Asia, like the new generation of Chinese (In the Mood for Love) and Korean movies. Also the story is quite dynamic although the violence still feels gratuitous compared with the Korean violent action movies.Sadly the story background is in sync with the mind of a poorly educated comic book script writer. He does not get much. And he says too much, exactly like the Sci Fi writers of the same generation. Somehow it used to be cool to be an ignorant and use science as a bag for buzz words. Hopefully this trend is off when anybody can check Wikipedia on their smartphone.Still, the action is good enough to compensate for the shortcomings.Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch",Null,0,0,11 July 2017

Yet, in Grease these scenes are somehow less distracting.Rewatching this movie made me think of its script and execution. This is not the regular studio fare where we have an opera play on multiple stages. It certainly feels less theatrical and more natural. And the cues are simple, almost childish, but effective. This way the message gets through even if there are strong cultural differences.I also liked the side stories. In a puritan America that still damns the contraception you have the 'easy' Rizzo saying to hell with the condom and than the probable pregnancy.

Many games have better graphics and I can go where I please, not where the director asked.And the animals? Well. Jurassic Park meet some other boring fantasy film. On a remote planet, where the atmosphere does not even seem to be right for humans, the WHOLE EXISTENCE is identical with the life of Pocahontas, as imagined by the 'superior' White intellect. The 'savages' have horses and ride them well. Oh! They even have bows and arrows!Compared with the work put into Jurassic Park to gather some resemblance with the real dinosaurs, this one is laughable. I mean, a horse with six legs, a dragon that can be ridden and a hammerhead shark headed rhino. And the bigger the beast, the denser the jungle, obviously.",Null,1,5,4 November 2018
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," As strong as 'In the Name of the Father' and more subtle
","I have to confess, I was skeptic about the quality of this movie. So much publicity usually is an attempt to mask a failure. In this case the publicity is well deserved.It's a drama and a story of treason. It depicts the context only to show that the new rulers are the same, turncoats as they get called by the end of the movie. I was shocked to have the same feeling as after reading Orwell's Animal Farm. And in a way it's the same story, only in a different context.From a distance the first part looks like The Thin Red Line. Only that the impact is more violent. In The Thin Red Line the men are doomed, but behind them the families, 'the civilization' goes on. In here there is no hope, there is no civilization and doom is spelled for all both young and all alike.This movie is not perfect, yet a statement this bold deserves more than 10 stars. To be able to call the honorable Royal Army what it is, this alone is a sign of courage. To call both parties for what they are and avoid taking the comfort of one side, now this is something in the World of Today. And Mr. Loach goes even further, he goes against his audience. He takes away the sickening optimism and stupid Hollywood-style happy end to unmask the treason, to show the World the naked truth of armed conflicts.Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch",Null,1,8,11 February 2010
Don't Breathe," Cheap thrills
","There is nothing a man can not do once he accepts the fact that there is no god. So do your prayers. And keep away from sin. A catholic boy image of a hell: sex and bodily fluids. Not very creative. But again, what can one expect from such a script writer? A magical world of Narnia. The blind can be deaf or with sensitive ears according to the needs of the script. And the script? Well, you have a blind Bluebeard. But you have Stephen King's Cujo too. You have the dark house from the Silence of the Lambs and a lot of others. You have a mad man's trap, because it is not a fortress, but a conventional alarm system. And the guy can have sensitive ears, which is not obvious for someone so skilled with guns, yet he has a high pitched alarm system.So if you want a roller-coaster ride without any thinking, this is the movie for you.

3. He is a new recruit, so he is going in action.

The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," the production team was very professional
","I watched the first one. And it was a disappointment. There are quite a few movies with the exact same story. And all I have seen are better than the Hunger Games. But I was told this is a revolutionary concept. So maybe the second one will show the revolution. Nope.The production team was very professional. The main actress has the best face in her life. And, as prosthetic, it looks quite fake. I mean anywhere the light is placed in the scene, the highlights on her plastic face look the same. Still, it shows well on the film posters. The costumes and backgrounds were very creative. They needed a new world look, after Harry Potter and Star Wars and Star Trek and hundreds of others. And they have it. Only I find them terribly ugly. I don't know. Maybe they were supposed to be ugly to make the clothing in the districts look nice. Weird.And that is about all. There is no revolution. The story probably follows the books. And the author just shows the privileged rich life spent so far. So the result is some sort of revolutionary Kens disobeying dictator Barbie.The districts are poorer and poorer as the number increases. Yet people are all equally fit. The hunger games has people that are fat by any dictatorship standard.I also disliked the use of token people that ended up enhancing the racism of the story. Sure, the blacks are the most poor. But not as poor as the star winners. In the end the poor whites are more miserable than the blacks. Than the districts seem to be racially divided. Than you get some black person in the crowd, yet probably the black person was neutered or something because nowhere outside the capital is there any race mixing.What is worse is the revolutionary book about a revolution is teaching teens to be sheep. One can be close and unguarded next to the dictatorial figure and. And do nothing. Show some mild contempt. One can be on live TV and shout in equal measure useless and hysterical slogans. And they all go to their killing just like that. But they scare the system with a gesture. Anyway, the revolution is less in this movie than on the evening news.Bottom line: a script that has more holes than Swiss cheese that teaches obedience and passivity.

And the idea fails to develop. What follows is 80 minutes of pure bore in some mambo–jumbo about numbers. The drama side is comic, the horror is just some gore in the beginning and some blood at the end. The sci is about some sliding seemingly metal rooms with a cute design.

In which the procedure, the checks and balances, the private property itself mean nothing to save 'the Ambassador'. In which a woman with a mask and a hidden identity can enter no matter what home, break stuff, take objects, because she has a gadget with a screen and a flashing dot.

No, the male should endure what was deemed humiliating for the women folk, in the name of equality.I have seen a masculinist manifesto: the male of the family can't handle things as well as the woman after 10 years of hard practice, but this is only because he doesn't use his superior male brain. Once he starts acting like a man, everything becomes a breeze, and the woman's experience of 10 years is acquired in less than a week, as shown, simply overnight.I have seen how the woman can't be a full person without popping more than 2 children, the 3 required for keeping a constant population. And, well, the evil one has none, because she won't do her civic duty to the king and country.I have disliked to have seen the big nosed person that would sell anything to anybody.

Just to show off their power.Almost three hours long? Gangs? New York? I was expecting another Once Upon a Time in America. But after the first half hour, after the fantasy battle of the freaks is done I could only think Lord of the Rings, or The Hobbit. Sure, the film is short on magic, but everything else is in place.

","Everywhere I turned there were people telling me about the Mad Max Reboot.With the original tale the warning was: it's not about nuclear disaster, it's about the lack of petrol. Which did not stop the audiences rave about nuclear disaster, especially after Chernobyl.With this one the production team made it clear. They put a useless monologue in the beginning to make sure the audience gets it now: it's about petrol. So a wise guy put in a lizard with two heads. Which, like in all cautionary tales written by English majors, lives and functions well.Now, because the problem is petrol, the only way to entertain yourself is to cover large distances without roads in inefficient cars that are made even less efficient with all sorts of addons.Precisely because there is no petrol, all people use electric tools that are fueled by the toxic fumes going out from the ears of the writers and director involved.And because there is no petrol, there are no roads either.
