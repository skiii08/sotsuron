Mission: Impossible III," MI3 is by the numbers
","Like its previous 2 incarnations Mission Impossible 3 is a by the numbers actioner which adds little to the genre. There is the requisite amount of explosions and gadgetry, an easy to follow plot and all outcomes can be predicted with absolute certainty.Having heard Abrahms was directing I had expected perhaps a little more character driven story development, and to be fair MI3 does posses more heart than the previous 2, however it is, sadly - no match for the likes of The Bourne Supremacy. Many people are praising Hoffmans performance and he does give us a stone cold killer. Ironically this is the films weakest point. So cold is Hoffman that his character is uninteresting - and indeed the editor seems to have realised this, Hoffamn gets about 8 lines and only a few short scenes. This, added to a 'Mcguffin' which no-one has put the slightest thought into, bring the film down many notches. A shame really.",6,4,13,6 May 2006
Oblivion," A man versus machine story with great visuals
","This is a film about assumptions, how wrong they can be and how they can destroy you, if you're not careful. This applies to machine intelligences as much as it does to those manipulated by them. Ultimately, we all make mistakes and we are all punished for them.Kosinskis film uses tropes from other sci-fi movies (what sci-fi movie doesn't?) and wraps them in the prettiest looking visuals since Bladerunner. The sci-fi future it depicts is almost retro in it's homage to various prog rock album cover art from the 1970's. This is a strength.Its main weakness is an unwillingness to push its world building further into the plot and stick to rather safer blockbuster territory with predictable twists and unreasonable optimism. The visuals remain a wallpaper essentially as the plot carries our hero onward is ways we have seen before, so many times.Nevertheless it is a far better film than critics would have you believe and Kosinski has delivered the goods here, well worth a look.",8,1,1,11 September 2013
Elysium," After a stunning debut, this is a disappointment
","Shades of 'Donnie Darko' here as again, a successful young filmmaker, lauded and certain for further glory crashes to earth with a a whimper, not a bang.I was going to say 'flies too close to the sun' but in this case no such lofty goal was attempted. Director Neill Blomkamp's District Nine heralded a new blazing talent in genre cinema. Bursting with moral outrage, this thinly disguised invective against apartheid by a white South African was a showstopper. Its premise - aliens invade, was hardly new. Its subtext, how we treat the invaders, how we treat each other and how inaccurately we peg our species on the moral scale was superb, fresh and intelligently handled.Alas. In Elysium Blomkamp hits on another a surefire hotbutton topic. His scenery is designed by amongst others: Bladerunner's Syd Mead (Oh yes, and it shows). His cinema verite style is present and his fascinating ing√©nue Sharlto Copley is also present (playing against District 9's type this time - but surely a Dinero in the making).So what went wrong? The main problem with this film is that it is a Michael Bay film. That's shorthand for: there is no subtext. Reviewers often call Bay's films 'boneheaded' and most are. But some (very few) are good! What's essential to understand about a Michael Bay film is that the lack of a subtext or a 'deeper meaning' is emphatically intentional.This was Blomkamp's summer actioner. From what I see on the screen he never intended to spark a single 'Obamacare' thread. The subject is too thinly treated - everything the public has focused their ire and admiration upon is essentially an afterthought.Here's another, more fatal problem with the film, Elysium.It Looks Cheap.Yes it shows the five or show glorious panning shots of Mead's Torus Spacestation that you see in the trailer - but THAT'S IT. The rest is mundane helicopter footage of favelas - familiar to audiences from Fast and Furious (film or FBI stumble - be my guest) and a very few sequences about on a par but not surpassing Blomkamp's incredible 'alive inside' advert for some motor company, way back when.There's little else to say. People will nitpick the ludicrous (to anyone with even a modicum of experience with computers) plot - and that's only worth mentioning because it betrays a general lack of care to the finished product.The dagger in my heart is this: recently Blomkamp extolled the virtues of that live action 'Masterpiece' Transformers the movie. Let me tell you: Transformers The Movie is a better movie than Elysium the movie.I just hope Blomkamp realises just what a great film his first effort was and we don't end up with another lazy hack like Kevin Smith or a deluded pseudo auteur like Tarantino.Some people need to heed Samuel Goldwyn's maxim: 'the harder I work, the luckier I get!'{Also worth mentioning: rare misfire from Matt Damon. He or his people always pick the best material. I'm surprised.}",6,0,3,25 August 2013
Prometheus," Pretty good. Does not fully capitalise on some of its own best ideas.
","The invective against this flawed but quite original sci-fi movie is so over the top Id rather review that than the film.Most of the 1 star reviews refer to 'plotholes' (when they mean mystery) without understanding the meaning of the term. They all complain that there are 'unanswered questions' and that the motivations of the characters seem to be 'random' or insufficiently unexplained.Lets examine Alien from that point of view.Who sent the distress signal? Why is there no explanation of the giant alien strapped to a huge chair/weapon? Why mess with a bunch of alien eggs - that 'appeaar to react to breaking the light' Why would Dallas volunteer to go into a maze of tunnels alone against a vicious alien creature? Why would Kane not be kept in quarantine even after the facehugger died and came off? How could the alien possibly know about the self destruct - does it speak English? Why would Ripley bother about the cat ? Couldn't the crew have just locked the all the doors in the main living area and waited it out? Why would a space mining vessel costing billions by staffed by fools like Brett and Parker? IF Ash received 'crew expendable' orders how come Weyland Yutani knew nothing about it in Aliens?The answer to all these questions is, it because it FITS the story. Todays google generation seems to want their movies to come prepackaged with all the answers. They hate mystery and mistakenly call it 'plotholes'. For instance 'why does the medpod only work on males'?. I can guess its because it is intended for Weyland, but that's a mystery, not a mistake. Why dos the captain appear to know more about Alien WMD than he is letting on? Because he's a former military man with a gut feeling for this sort of thing? He wouldn't even have to be since its clear as a a bell that when you fill a delivery mechanism with jars of death it's a 'weapon of mass destruction' (I didn't like the concurrency of the phrase but that wont matter 30 years from now).When someone told me 'hurray, Scott is directing' I was nonplussed. 'But Scott directed classics like Bladerunner and Gladiator' - yeah well he directed White Squall and Black Rain too. Not to mention 'legend'. Besides Bladerunner is only well regarded because of Syd Mead's work, realising William Gibson's vision. And Gladiator is Scotts derivative go at swords and sandals after Mad Mel Gibson revived the genre with the ballsy 'Braveheart' - a film twice as violent and yet twice as nuanced. Yet Scott has no peer when it comes to the language of Cinema. This film is his best work to date on that score. You may find it clunky, you may find it hollow - but you will find its images haunting your mind for some time to come.",7,3,6,8 July 2013
