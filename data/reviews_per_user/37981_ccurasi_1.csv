Resident Evil: Afterlife," Afterlife is one of the best zombie-action movies ever made!
","Being a fan of the Resident Evil franchise since the original game released, I have been following Paul Andersons's films very closely. While all three films thus far (excluding Apoclapse which followed the resident evil 3 plot line very loosely) were hardly connected to the resident evil plot line, I still enjoyed them for what they were: good zombie films with lots of action. Knowing this I still had high expectations for the forth film as Anderson never fails to deliver an exciting movie and the addition of 3D and a plot containing core elements of resident evil 5 seemed very promising. And let me tell you, the forth film blew my mind in every possible aspect. Simply put, it was amazing! Without giving too much away, Alice takes the fight right to Umbrella's doorstep (and includes many of her clones discovered in the end of the third film.) While searching for survivors, she stumbles across Claire and teams up with a group of survivors in LA all the while attempting to survive against a never ending wave of zombies(many of which are similar to the Majini in resident evil 5), a massive Axe wielding giant and the one and only Wesker himself. Anderson succeeded completely with this film which included action, suspense, lots of gore and even some comedy! Milla Jovovich performed amazingly as Alice and has really developed her character as you will see in this film. Ali Larter also was a knockout as Claire and even gave Milla a run for her money as the tough female star. The supporting cast was amazing and were casted perfectly. Finally the addition of Wentworth Miller as Chris Redfield and Shawn Roberts as Wesker produced potentially the greatest face-of ever seen in a movie (just wait till the fight with Alice, Claire and Chris vs Wesker and you will nearly die of excitement.) Paul Anderson has given us a film that is so much more then ever expected from anyone, taking a popular video game franchise and creating it's very own plot that takes the series to a whole new level. This film will gave any fan of the resident evil series a fangasm without fail. And to those who are not fans of the films, games or even zombies in general you should still consider seeing it as at it's core it is still a near limitless action thrill ride that you don't want to miss.As a warning, don't listen to major critics for reviews for this film. They over analyze it and fail to see the film for its true geniusness. Trust me when I tell you that you will enjoy the movie be it in 2D 3D or even Imax, its just that damn good. Oh and stick around after the credits as it presents a sneak peak at the fifth film which will certainly made as the film has currently made over 73 million dollars in just 3 days compared to it's 60 million budget (check wikipedia if you don't believe me). Check it out, you have nothing to lose and you will be glad you did.",10,13,28,12 September 2010
