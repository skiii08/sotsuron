Source Code," Never seen such a retarded ending ever
","This movie seemed to tell a story about stimulation, but contained so many faults that watching it was like watching the director and the writer slapping their own faces. And if they failed to cover up their lie, then it's not audiences' job to invent explanations for them.Plus, parallel worlds wouldn't explain this story well either. I mean, if we copy exact the same world from yesterday, what are the odds that it grows into what we have today? Let alone pointing out the murder.Put aside these logical faults, let's take a look at the end of the story. If it ended right at when they kissed and and the whole world froze, then I would think this movie as some fairy tale and forgive it for trying to insult my intelligence. But nooooooo, it continued to torture me, and I'm really glad when it finally ended.",5,1,2,21 September 2011
