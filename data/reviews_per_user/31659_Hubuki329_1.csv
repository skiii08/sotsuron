Requiem for a Dream," Real Problem is...
","When I saw this,Im so scared how drug addiction ruin peoples. But after I recovered from shock of movie,I beginning to think what ruined them wasn't drugs.(Drugs are direct reason they are ruined,but they could have saved)It was USA medical systems and doctor's ignorance,amphetamines have been known It has serious harm to mind and body in other countries.Doctor could have check it.(there were peoples who ruined their life by Amphetamines in early of 1950's) Harry possibly didn't lose his arm If doctor tend his arm first then call police. Marion need some kind social support which help get out from addiction. Tyrone need medical care instead just let him lay on bed.Drug addiction is scary but society which doesn't support who isn't good condition is much more worse.Anyway,this movie is still good,but not because it shows how drug addiction ruins people,it is because movie show how world become cruel If society is unforgiving and doesn't support people who are suffering.",Null,0,0,5 October 2011
