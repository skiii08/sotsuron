Hereditary," Not the Classic or modern day Exorcist
","Just saw this at Milton Keynes Cineworld with a 2/3rd's full audience. My counter review is that it was superb for the first two thirds of the movie ideally building to something superb. 
Then with no spoilers we had the final third of the movie that just didn't work. When the audience started laughing we knew the film had lost them and us also.Superbly acted by all four main cast, great use of visuals and sound, fails to deliver in the final third. Went into the film very excited and came away disappointed and cheated by the end.5/10.P.s. I love horrors of a supernatural bias including some of the very best Korean movies like The Wailing.",5,1,2,15 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Entertaining but not great
","7/10 an entertaining, far superior to the travesty that is Last Jedi, visually gorgeous movie. Nowhere near as bad as some of the reviews are saying but nowhere near as good as 4,5,6, Rogue One and Revenge of The Sith. On a par with The Mandalorian but no Baby Yoda. It will at times really excite you but it's also full of terrible dialogue, blatant fan service, and merchandise opportunities.We didn't get a trilogy that we should have had with old Luke, Leia and Han, that's the biggest disappointment I believe.",7,2,7,20 December 2019
