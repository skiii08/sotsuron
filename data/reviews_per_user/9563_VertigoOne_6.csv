The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Pleasantly surprised, even moved.
","I really haven't expected much from The Hunger Games after seeing the first movie. I thought that the books were engaging and, at times, dramatic and felt that the first book was not adapted well to the screen. There was no real tension between Peeta and Katniss and some of the finest moments of the book were butchered in the film.Interestingly enough, Mockingjay, I felt, was the worst book of the series; but as far as I am concerned it might be the best film so far. The first film, in my opinion, was a train wreck; the second film was a brilliant recovery; and this third film is far above my expectations.Jennifer Lawrence is a good actress, but this is not her best acting. I feel that the script is so poorly written that she is forced to do unthinkable things on screen - yet she manages to pull them off. For instance, how many times can an actor be expected to cry, gasp, or yell in a single film? Jennifer Lawrence does very well under the circumstances. I think that the surprise performance, however, was from Elizabeth Banks as Effie. I have never truly enjoyed her character until this film, and in this film she nearly steals every scene she's in.I was not convinced that this story was worth filming until I saw this film, which is far better than it should have been. See it. It is dramatic and even touching - and very timely. You won't likely be disappointed.",5,1,8,8 March 2015
The Passion of Joan of Arc," A Test of Patience
","One could say that this film functions as a sort of 'rite of passage' for art film aficionados. As they say, 'If you can make it through this, you can make it through anything.' However, 'Jeanne d'Arc' does not function as an overall great film in its own right, at least in my opinion.Honestly speaking, I would have found it nearly impossible to tell whether or not this was a so-called 'great film' had I not seen it on '100-best' movie lists. Certainly, I admire the creative camera angles and other directorial achievements of the film -- in this sense, it is somewhat interesting. However, no one, not even the most pretentious film snob should claim this film is interesting in terms of 'entertainment value.'Now, don't misunderstand me. Great works of art do not 'have' to be entertaining; but, all great works of art are 'fun' for one reason or another. I will explain.First of all, this, of course, depends on one's definition of 'fun.' The most basic, fundamental definition of fun -- mindless amusement -- is not that to which I am referring, though some great films do have this sort of appeal. (All works of art should make their audience think). Rather, the kind of fun I'm referring to is best described as a feast for the senses. One reason why I particularly love 'Citizen Kane' and view it as my ideal 'great film' is because, if one engages every part of their being as they watch the film, the film will open itself up to them. It comes at its audience from many angles: it is an absolutely hilarious film, a dark film, a frighteningly ambiguous film, etc., depending on the perspective of the viewer.The problem that great films often pose to their audience is that they first REQUIRE that the audience think -- even be willing to suffer -- before they begin to give back in their feasting of the senses. Truly great films give back on one's investment of focus, engagement, and meditation on the film. I just don't believe that 'Jeanne d'Arc' gives back enough. I can only take so much of Maria Falconetti's exalted expressions before my sense of logic tells me, 'Okay, now! That's enough! I get the idea!' I feel like nearly half the film is spent staring into her pupils. To some, this might mark greatness; and yes, I admit that it makes the viewer think. But to me, it does not make the film watchable; and ultimately, I do not believe it pays off.These are my thoughts about the film. Sadly, I was expecting to enjoy it. I was ready for another feast of the senses, to have some fun, like with so many other great films; but sadly, this film could serve only as punishment to a sort of 'frenemie,' someone I am trying to wear out or impress via my film knowledge. This is not my version of a great film and it's one of the longest 90 minutes I've ever spent in front of a screen. (2/5)",4,3,13,22 July 2019
The Theory of Everything," Good, but surprisingly bland
","Unfortunately, I'm not sure what The Theory of Everything is about. It ventures many places but arrives nowhere. Everything seems to be in place. The acting is some of the best I've ever seen and the musical score is fitting. Nothing comes across to me as sappy in the entire running time of the film. Still, I am left empty.Maybe the blandness of the film is derived from the fact that Hawking is not yet dead. Maybe, if he was it would be easier to pinpoint exactly what his life was about. Instead, we are left with a film about theories and scientific discoveries but are also left absolutely clueless as to what they are about. Personally, I do not know much about Hawking, but this film did not succeed in making me any more interested in researching him.Don't get me wrong. This is a very good film. It takes the viewer on a real journey and gently presses you to feel. Can we live with ourselves? If we had to carefully select our words, as Hawking does, would we have anything to say? I believe each of us would live much differently if we were truly grateful for what we have. I don't think anyone realizes this as much as Dr. Hawking.Overall, a well-deserved Oscar for Redmayne.",2,1,1,25 February 2015
Big Hero 6," Wow, every cliché in the book?
","I just finished watching Big Hero 6 for the first time. I was stunned... by how many clichés were able to fit into one film. It's amazing how entire films can be made without a single original idea. Maybe I'm being too critical. But I don't think so.Take the 'E.T.' climax for example or the 'let's become superheros 'idea'' or the 'my best friend's a robot' or 'my parents are dead' or basically anything else in the film. None of it's truly original. All the way down to the achingly bad 'San Fransokyo' thing. There were a few times when I was genuinely entertained. The only problem is - that's not why I watch movies, to become a mindless garbage receptacle. I hate to admit it but what was said about Krei early in the film - that he basically cheats his way around science and only cares about money is EXACTLY where Walt Disney Studios is right now. I hate to say it but Disney is showing that it is not concerned with true art, only $$On the other hand, a truly beautiful work of art came out in 2013, from a real film studio with integrity Studio Ghibli. Did it get the credit it deserved? Not even close. If you want to watch an actual film that's worth your time, look up The Tale of Princess Kaguya. The Best Animated Film Oscar was stolen from Kaguya - if not bought off. Somehow it ended up with this piece of garbage? Big Hero 6? It's all about $$",1,85,223,24 February 2015
Castle in the Sky," Better than Spirited Away
","In no way am I slamming Spirited Away! It is a great film! But there is something about the purity of Castle in the Sky that blows me away. Has there ever been a more beautiful title sequence than the one in this film or a more beautiful musical theme or a more breathtaking castle? Each scene seems patiently thought through and carefully timed. The character development is plentiful but not overdone. I really love this film. More than anything else, I think it is dear to my heart.For one thing, I can't get over the action sequences. The mother is hilarious and totally runs the show with her band of hyper-masculinized idiots. It is a real joy to see the cars swerve back and forth as characters speed down the road in a tense car chase. There is real humor and grit in this film, and I believe that it belongs on anyone's list of classics, along with the rest of Ghibli's repertoire.My introduction to this film was upon reading Leonard Maltin's movie guide book about 7 years ago. I was very surprised to see that he had given a Japanese anime film 4 stars. (If anyone is familiar with Maltin, you would know he doesn't just 'give away' four stars). He said that it was one of the best action films ever made, animated or otherwise. I was already familiar with Miyazaki's work via Spirited Away and was very excited to get my hands on a copy of Castle in the Sky. At first, I wasn't all that impressed with the film. It seemed melancholy compared to the flat-out dynamism of Spirited Away. But over time this film has warmed up to me and has earned a special place on my shelf. I would recommend to anyone interested in seeing this film, or who has seen it before and didn't really like it, to give it time. Allow Castle in the Sky to enchant you. It is SO worth it.",10,0,2,22 October 2010
Inception," Shades of Kubrick, but far too complicated
","Stanely Kubrick was full of great ideas that would, maybe to others, be unfilmable; but under his hands, they were living, breathing dreamworlds. Surprisingly, for how mind-numbingly intellectual his films were, it seems they were (wisely) portrayed minimalistically. Everything that happened in Kubrick's films did not happen on screen and his scripts, while complicated, were amazingly coherent. The audience's imagination is freed this way. Of course, both Nolan and Kubrick are expressionists, but where Kubrick's films were coherent Nolan's are often frustrated into utter incoherence.The Dark Knight series lacked real emotional power due to this over-complicatedness, despite having, at times, the 'cool' factor. Inception is no different. It could be riveting and interesting IF there was intellectual breathing room. Instead, the mind is suffocated with concepts taken to extremes that would better fit a TV series than a single film.Inception has good action and a really interesting concept, but as usual Nolan takes it as far as it can go - and than a little bit further, eventually crossing the line into incoherence. Like Kubrick, I think Nolan is one of those amazing people straddling the fence between genius and insanity. Sometimes we get the insanity.",5,2,5,28 March 2015
