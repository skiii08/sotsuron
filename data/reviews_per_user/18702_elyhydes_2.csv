The Ring," Great movie, but some people are just stupid.
","Ok people.  This is a great movie.  It is the scariest movie I've seen in a long time.  The acting wasn't horrible as some have said.  I don't know what movie they were watching.Also, there are no loose ends.  Everything's there.  Just because you weren't smart enough to pick up on them, doesn't mean it was a bad movie. And the end scene?  That guy who said it was disappointing and aniclimatic? It was great.Thank you.",Null,0,0,12 December 2002
Face_Off," This movie is bad.
","This movie is bad.  Don't watch it.  John woo is horrible.  First Broken arrow: horrible.  Face off:  equally bad.  MI II:  positively horrible. Windtalkers:  why did I even watch it?  I'll learn someday. As for you people, common, when will you learn that a bunch of big explosions don't make a movie?",1,3,7,24 September 2002
