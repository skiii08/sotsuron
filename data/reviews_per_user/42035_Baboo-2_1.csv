Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Just sit back and enjoy the movie!
","This is a movie to be enjoyed for what it is - a basic good versus evil movie that every member of the family can enjoy and take something away from.  I saw it first with my husband and loved it, but enjoyed it even more taking my five year old daughter and viewing it through her eyes.  We plan on seeing it many more times!",10,6,8,8 June 1999
