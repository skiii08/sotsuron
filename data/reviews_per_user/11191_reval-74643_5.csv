First Man," The human story behind the first man on the moon
","If you want to see a CGI-driven boys-own portrayal of Apollo 11 this is probably not your movie. If you want to watch a realistic, gripping tale of the human and emotional cost of going to the moon (just 60 years after man first flew!) in terms of ball-busting courage, commitment and relationships this is more it. The bravery of Neil Armstrong and his colleagues is palpable, the launch visuals so visceral and Gosling and Foy are superb.",9,0,1,22 October 2018
Interstellar," Like a fine wine
",Like a fine wine that is full of complex notes and is a pleasure to imbibe this movie is all of those things. It also gets better with age. Just watched it for the fourth time in 2018 on blu-ray and it's even better than the first time I saw it. The story is both contemporary and futuristic and speaks to our human condition and poor custody of our planet. It's also a great thrill-ride.,9,1,3,8 October 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Far too much of a good thing...
","This is a very good film (brilliant in places) but bloated - just far, far too long. And it feels like the MCEU is nearing the end with its visibly aging stars.",7,2,7,30 April 2018
Joker," Sickeningly Superb
","It's rare for a film to stay with me into the next day, but this was such a powerfully disturbing, brilliantly acted story that I was thinking about it on and off for a long time. Joker is a deeply thoughtful, visceral reflection on the sad brokenness of a life cruelly twisted by the sins of others, that leads to hatred and violence. It is a dramatic tour-de-force from Joaquin Phoenix.",10,1,1,7 October 2019
Incredibles 2," Worth the wait
","Apart from an unnecessary boring 2 min segment, that adds nothing, with Elastigirl and Evelyn Deavor talking about the merits of selling or creating (no spoiler) this is a slam-dunk follow-up with brilliant storytelling, humour and characterisation. Brilliant for kids and parents alike.",9,1,3,17 July 2018
