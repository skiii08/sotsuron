Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Visually stunning, yet at the same time the most over-hyped movie I have ever seen.
","Visually stunning, yet at the same time the most over-hyped movie I have ever seen. None of the characters have personality (save Darth Maul and Obi-Won every once in a while) and I found myself rooting for Darth Maul to win just so he'd be on the screen longer.  Overlong, with some of the worst acting  and characters (Jar Jar Bincs deserves Oscar for most annoying character ever. Felt like I was watching a rip off of 'Men In Black' most of the time, with aliens coming into the picture just for cheap laughs, something Lucas would never have done in the original Trilogy.  For any TRUE Star Wars fan, this movie was a disgrace to the originals.",3,0,1,22 May 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Really Good, not great.
","I was hoping to see a last 'great' movie from Kubrick when I saw Eyes Wide Shut.  What I saw, though, was a really good movie that could probably have been better.   Cruise is amazing in the movie, and you can definitely tell it's a Kubrick movie (ie. It lets us think about the characters, it doesn't tell us right away what there thinking), but Kidman was disappointing.  The movie, on a whole, was enjoyable, but it doesn't live up to the hype.  I had to remind myself that I'm not watching Dr. Strangeglove, 2001, or Full Metal Jacket, but a different movie by a great director.  In it's own different way it succeeds, and makes you wish he was around to make more.",9,0,0,17 July 1999
