The Devil's Advocate," Entertainment as it is
","'Devil's Advocate' is a very entertaining film that somehow managed to interest the spectator with ease.It deals with the conscience in the laws, specially at lawyer's job. I feel it has a good critic concerning this kind of lawyers that care only about the money, instead of caring about the word justice. As a law student, I believe that this kind of lawyers are the reason many outlaws get away with murder and cause most of the problems of our society.Despite that, this film is much more entertaining than rational. I personally prefer 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' because it has a very good debate involving faith vs science and has much more scary scenes than this one. For pure entertainment, stay with Devil's Advocate; for entertainment and a little more, watch Emily Rose's.",7,3,5,28 March 2011
The Blair Witch Project," Awesome
","Well, I remember how terrified people of my age were when this movie came out. When it was on TV, nobody dared to see this picture, given it would frighten you for weeks. Last night I gathered some friends who have never seen this, and let me tell you, we really enjoyed it. As many people have already said, it scares because it doesn't show anything, just leave you imagining all the creepy stuff. All the three main actors are extremely professional in what they're doing, you can't say they're acting-- specially Heather Donahue, whose panic face in the last scenes is phenomenal. As many people also already said, this movie inspired many others, which makes it even better, considering it's huge originality back when released. All in all, this is one of the BEST horror movies out there, give it a chance and you won't regret-- except if you don't care about people's feelings.",9,1,2,24 December 2012
The King's Speech," Not that brilliant
","I can remember as if it was yesterday how much this film was well reviewed when released back in the beginning of 2011. I can't remember reading one single review saying this film isn't very good, so I decided to watch this myself. The story is quite simple for an Oscar movie; a Prince (and in the end, King) has a problem in his voice so he can't speak without stammering. After going to lots of doctors, he goes to a normal citizen who promises to cure his problem, which cause some troubles in his life. I thought this normal citizen would in fact cure his problem, but in the end, his attempts are useless. Nothing much really happens and it lacks in drama in most scenes. There's nothing too strong, emotional or interesting to keep your eyes wide open. Maybe this film is designed for an older audience.",6,4,9,3 January 2012
The Mask," Ooh, somebody make me stop laughing!
","I first saw this movie when I was about 7, and just saw it again (18 now). I remember it used to scary me, don't know the reason yet.The Mask involves the audience and it's impossible to not laugh in some parts. The best for me was the Mexican cop's dance, although it was totally idiot, this is the kind of comedy that makes me laugh - and the one where Jim Carrey works better. The never ending limousine was quite funny as well.I had no idea how hot Cameron Diaz was, her beauty is different from modern girls. I don't know what is it, but she attracted me in a way no other actress has done so far without being in a porn movie, so she got my respect from now on.I tend to not like action movies because they usually take longer time to finish, but this one had the ideal length to don't bother the spectator (or just a few minutes more than the ideal). Another Carrey's great performance.",7,0,0,3 December 2010
Vertigo," Give me a break
","From the get go I dislike this movie for such bad labeling. Most people consider this movie as a 'suspense classic', whilst, in my point of view, it has no suspense at all. First, because there isn't an interesting mystery to be resolved; due to it's bad and slow plot, I just couldn't care less about who was Madeleine or why that girl was trying to commit suicide. I also didn't care about the retired cop or the crazy husband; they were both annoying. The plot is simply pointless, and so is the outcome. I don't blame Alfred Hitchcock for this movie being so bad, considering that plot itself is much worse than directing. Directing without a good plot can't deliver an entertaining and convincing movie, which is exactly the case. For those who look for real suspenseful movies with quality, consider watching 1960's 'Psycho' instead.",4,8,17,11 July 2013
Black Swan," That's what I call a workaholic woman
","Watching a movie after a thousand of positive reviews is something a little pointless, since your single opinion won't change the hype the film has. Fortunately, it wasn't the case; 'Black Swan' is definitely a good movie that deserves to be seen and congratulated.This movie works as a psychological thriller, which looks just like a nightmare. Natalie Portman plays an apparently innocent and unprotected girl who's afraid of everybody but improves after a while. There are lots of things involved in her disturbed life: fear, perfectionism, naivety, neurosis and even drugs come to her life. By the way, the disco scene was veeery well made, I felt myself in the party with them! Unfortunetaly, it has some predictable things, like when Nina tells the story to 'Jerry' and she says that the girl kills herself in the end; I instantly realizes she was going to do the same in the end.'Black Swan' may not deserve an Oscar for the best 2010 film, but is surely worth a watch!",8,1,3,24 June 2011
Changeling," tell me what you want to hear
","Changeling is a movie that everyone should give a watch. Much like 'Bordertown', it's an example of justice pursuance.Being a woman in a period that women have no rights must had been terrifying for Mrs. Collins. It is interesting to see that even though the society was very macho, women fought for their rights and some men supported them. It was also interesting to notice that the only way of reading about the city problems were through the newspaper, which nowadays we know how tendentious it can be.Angelina Jolie acting was good, although her character wasn't that hard to play.About the death penalty: I don't think it should be used anywhere in this world. Leave the condemned stuck in jail for the rest of his life, but don't kill him... the man in this movie was a serial killer, a coward, but after all he's an human who will suffer before dying like he did in the movie. I'm very glad we don't have death penalty in my country, although many people here may deserve that...",9,2,6,20 January 2011
Captain Phillips," Sometimes the scariest things (don't) come from within'
","This film surprised me in such a good way that I feel almost out of words to express how much I enjoyed it. First off, we have an extremely entertaining picture, mainly due to GREAT characterization of the villains. I mean, director portrayed them in a so bad way that it seemed impossible not to feel afraid of them. Also, those actors brought reality to the characters, proving that they've been intelligently chosen. The tension is built from the get go, and once the pirates get into the ship, everything gets out of control and I couldn't think about anything other than this horrifying story. About the acting, I know several people stated that Tom Hanks was magnificent in this movie; well, not that I totally disagree with them, but I found the villains' acting to be better than his-- except in the final scene with the navy doctor, which was really moving, thanks to the actors involved and to the strong directing/soundtrack. Another good point of this film is that it doesn't try to make governmental propaganda for the USA, even if lauding its army sometimes. Besides, the movie never engages on being lame; for a moment, I thought that Phillips would be saved by the hurt Somali guy, which would feel EXTREMELY cliché, cheesy and lame. However, director Paul Greengrass doesn't appeal to this kind of false sentimentalism, reason why he deserves the biggest part of my congratulations for this project. It just doesn't deserve a 10 because filmmakers didn't bother explaining why they had NO weapons or security in the ship; I mean, they could've invented some lawsuit forbidding them on carrying loaded guns, or something. Anyways, 'Captain Phillips' is the BEST movie I've seen from 2013 and I hardly doubt there will be any other just as great. Congratulations!",9,1,3,17 July 2014
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Bah
","I'm much aware people are going to hate me to death for my opinion about this picture, but I'm saying it anyway. From the get go I already knew it was gonna be a movie for a 'Juno' audience-- mainly because of the irritating teenagers there were in my cinema session. Logan Lerman plays a typical nerd who nobody cares about, and as predictable as it could be, he becomes a nice guy after some while, whereas the nice guys become boring. That's been used in 26548761234 past American movies and I really don't understand HOW IMDb users miss that. Emma Watson is just boring as she is in every movie. The main couple is completely predictable, irritating, and when they had their first kiss was the catalyst for me to leave the cinema room-- something I've NEVER done in my entire life. Surely soundtrack is also horrible; be prepared to listen to strange rock-likely gangs-- if you like rock, you won't enjoy it. All in all, it's just another typical American teenage drama with nothing else to offer you.",1,26,64,4 December 2012
50 First Dates," Like it was the first time
","I'm in love and this movie came right on time. There's no point in telling '50 First Dates''s plot, considering that EVERYBODY knows what's the main story of this film. All I can say this is extremely well written, directed and acted; everyone involved in this project is very professional, with big highlight to Drew Barrymore, who played the most beautiful character I've ever seen. How to not fall in love with such wonderful and careful girl? The simplicity in which this movie was made gave it a realistic and involving story, mostly due to the great cast chosen. I'm out of words to describe how incredible this movie is! Soundtrack and scenario are ALSO well done. My only complaint is to the cheesy scene in which Lucy tried to break up with him; it felt too Hollywood, but didn't spoil the movie as a whole. Great movie, give it a try!",8,1,1,4 July 2013
Catch Me If You Can," Getting Away With Murder
","Well, first I'd like to comment how easy it is to lure spectator into this movie, due to the great names involved in this project. Steven Spielberg, Leonardo DiCaprio and Christopher Walken are what made me wanna see it. To be honest, the film as a whole is good. Frank Jr. is a guy who is willing to do anything in his power to make easy money, even if it means stealing and cheating all around. There are plenty of moments in which the spectator gets to think 'he won't get away with it', but, surprisingly, the well written plot always allows him escaping from the FBI. However, sometimes the way DiCaprio's character gets away feels over-the-top, considering that people wouldn't be THAT dumb in real life. I mean, how would Frank Jr. work as a physician in a hospital without EVER being asked about diseases or something related to it? Wouldn't Brenda's family make questions involving medicine? So, in my opinion, 'Catch Me If You Can' is a well directed movie that entertains the spectator for the whole time, but sometimes admits to be just a movie and not a real thing.",7,3,5,1 May 2014
The Hangover," how says Akon, 'I Tried So Hard'
","'The Hangover' is basically about four dudes who go to Vegas for a bachelor party, but things don't go as they planned. I have to admit I had some few laughs in the film, but it showed nothing original or different from what we've already seen. After the first night in Vegas, they forget everything they did last night because they have mistakenly taken Rohypno instead of an ecstasy. From there on, all the scenes were about three of them looking for the other missing dude and all we have is a memory of 'Dude Where's My Car?' with older guys and another town. But at least the movie was good at showing true friendship among men and the problems we have to face with our wives. Therefore, I found no reason to watch 'The Hangover' again or recommend, but will surely watch with friends after some beers",5,0,2,14 December 2010
Ghost," Love lasts forever
","I feel so sorry that I haven't watched it 'till today.. I spent months looking for a good new movie, but now I realize that going back to the past seems to be easier to find one.'Ghost' is an extremely great movie that showed everything the spectator wanted to see. Love, hate, friendship, revenge, justice, determination... It is indeed a classic which has to be seen by everyone who likes cinema and their development throughout the years. Also it deserves to be rated well for its originality and authenticity.The acting of the main couple was satisfying and Whoopi Goldberg's character was a good support for the couple and her acting was truly funny. A must see for film lovers.",10,1,1,20 December 2010
The Ring," Bah
","People hyped this film all around the world, stating this is one of the most scary movies ever. You guys who did that should start stop lying. 'The Ring' has a perfect photography direction and editing; the actors do their best, Naomi Watts does an amazing job here. But something just doesn't work. Whilst the story is original and very intriguing, the film itself isn't able to scare or chill the spectator. The famous Samara only appears in the last minutes, spending less time in scene than a movie extra in 'Titanic'. I have no idea if the original Japanese version is better or worse than this, anyway I'm not recommending 'The Ring' to any of my friends.",5,0,1,9 October 2011
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Roger Rabbit
","Well, Roger Rabbit is a cute character that becomes desperate when he believes his pretty human wife is cheating on him. The man who supposedly had an affair with his wife (Jessica Rabbit) dies and, at first sight, people start thinking Roger Rabbit is the murderer-- even thought posteriorly we understand Roger wouldn't kill a mouse. Special effects are reasonable for the year it's been released. The whole story is creative and comic at many scenes, but I feel there's no big difference from other movies; there's nothing special to make this film deserve more than a 6 rating. If you're looking just for pure entertainment, this may satisfy you.",6,0,1,5 June 2012
Gravity," In The Air Tonight
","After all the hype surrounding this film, I finally found it in my local video store. From the get go, I had this one thing irritating me repeatedly: the way Clooney's character reacted to everything that was happening. I mean, they were making a big effort in order to keep alive, and he acted calmly and jerky, like it wasn't a serious matter. If fighting for your life isn't a serious matter, I don't know what is. However, I forgive Kowalski's jerk behavior, considering it's just a blockbuster made for mainstream. Other than that, 'Gravity' proves to be professional in almost all the way through; there are great special effects and many tense moments. The difficulties both characters had to face were due to the very application of Murphy's Law: anything that could go wrong, went REALLY wrong. The spaceship and its accessories were breaking for all the time, and I asked myself if director/writer wasn't trying too hard to build some trouble, in order to compensate the lack of material. I ended up not knowing if it was a good or bad thing, but either way, the movie still managed to be tense, agonizing and thrilling, delivering a happy ending that we all wanted to see. Maybe I don't agree with many people that labeled it as 2013's best movie, but I surely recognize its production values, reason why I give it a rating of 7.",7,0,1,27 February 2014
Erin Brockovich," Sorry seems to be the hardest word
","Erin Brockovich is a strong and likable woman not because she is calm, polite or rich; it's due to the authenticity of her character that makes her so adorable. She feels like a REAL woman, who albeit having some bad qualities, never gives up on her desires. Julia Roberts does, in here, one of the best performances of her career, which is the main reason why this film works. The plot, on the other hand, is sometimes a little too long, which made me think there is no need for two hours of length. Also, I expected a little more intensity in the outcome, since I expected it to be the movie's climax. However, in fact, there is no climax at all. 'Erin Brockovich' is a good storytelling and has a great acting, but never tries to provoke strong emotions, so don't expect it to be a tearjerker and you'll probably have a good time.",6,0,1,20 January 2015
Meet the Parents," Great
","Well, 'Meet The Parents' is a known movie and now I can say why. It is a very American kind of comedy that makes you laugh and identify yourself with the protagonist, no matter if you are a man or a woman. Greg tries everything to fit in the family, but things don't go the way he wishes, given that his father-in-law is an inconvenient person. There are lots of funny scenes built with intelligence, such as the airport one, which shows how bureaucratic these companies usually are. Writers portrayed Robert De Niros' character as an eventual nice guys, which makes us don't hate him, otherwise we wouldn't enjoy the movie as a whole as we all do. All the cast is extremely professional, with big congratulations for Ben Stiller for being so spontaneous. In the end, despite all the good and funny scenes, we still have some beautiful messages about family and love. Great movie!!!",9,2,2,21 October 2013
Se7en," So so
","Well, I expect more for this film. Some people have compared it to 'Silence of the Lambs'. Okay, there are some similarities, but Hannibal film had a muuch creepier atmosphere and was frightening. Se7en is just a regular police/investigation movie where the serial killer is smarter than the rest of the world.Morgan Freeman sadly just repeats his characters over and over. He's always the wise man, with wise phrases and very cult. That's so easy to act; no need to train for the new character, just play himself.Brad Pitt's acting is average and the same as any American actor.But at least Se7en has some originality and seemed to be an inspiration for nowadays' films like 'Saw'.",6,2,4,2 April 2011
Unbreakable," what's to love about it?
","Good things about 'Unbreakeable':1. Directing: Shyamalamalam is very professional at directing this. He knows exactly how to do the contrast of colors and provide the feeling he wants to focus. 2. Entertainment: somehow Mr. Shy manages to intrigue the spectator and, with the good directing, force the audience to keep playing attention 3. Originality: I personally have never seen a movie like thisBad things:1. Writing: Mr. Shy carries the story on and on and gets to nowhere. Not to mention the slow development. 2. Confusion: in the last 30 minutes, there are thousand of scenes that we have no idea of what the main actor is doing. Actually, sometimes we don't even know if it's really him. 3. Ending: what on earth was intend of it?? the story got nowhere and seemed to be a moral lesson about superheroes. It's very not satisfying.Despite that, the movie shows that Mr. Shy is extremely able to make an horror movie if he wants to. There are quite few scenes that we have some jumps, and we see that if the director wanted, he could make the most creepy atmosphere ever. Maybe he should give a try at making an horror movie in future. I believe it'd be great.",4,1,2,30 March 2011
Fight Club," Does Taylor like S&M?
","Fight Club is an interesting movie that begins well and ends not that well. It's one of those movies you have to pay attention to everything, otherwise you will not get it. Furtunately, the filmmakers are competent at making you pay attention and get interested to it. Also the actors are very professional and here we see a better Brad Pitt than what he was in 'Se7en'. The philosophical thoughts concerning capitalism, communism and society in general are very useful.The ending of this movie is clever, unexpected and original, but I feel like it was overlong. After we discover that Brad Pitt is his own conscience, the writer could just have showed some past scenes of the movie and finished it that way. No need to reinvent some unnecessary plot that adds nothing to the story. Overall a good movie and better than most of IMDb's Top 250.",8,0,1,23 April 2011
As Good as It Gets," As Long As It Gets
","Good things about this movie: the characters are well developed, I couldn't find a single inconsistency in their actions and reactions. The story and plot are quite original, showing a natural daily that happen in everyone's life. Some performances are good, but I disagree with those who say these performances are extraordinary. I think they are just average or a little above. Bad things: Jack Nicholson's character is too annoying in my opinion. He speaks too slow and distributes gratuitous rudeness words to everyone around. I know the movie is supposed to show the routine of these three or four main characters, but it gets boring once nothing much really happens. The plot is so weak that we feel it's never gonna reach a climax, so I could turn it off and never see the ending-- and not even caring about it. Also, they didn't need to film 139 minutes of footage, there are many unnecessary scenes that wouldn't compromise the movie's story or quality. I don't have anything to say about directing. It's normal, not good and not bad. All in all, don't even bother watching this, only if you are really curious like I was.",5,0,2,22 August 2011
Monster," U Don't Have to Call
","Well, I discovered this film in a kinda funny way. I had a week of hard job interviews and I was very stressed, so I told my brother and my sister-in-law that I wish I would never have an interview again. Then she told me that the film 'Monster' has a scene where the main girl tries to work in a law firm, and once she's rejected, she scolds and says she didn't even want the job. I found that VERY funny, since that was my real will-- just because I was truly stressed, not that I'm rude or anything.So, 'Monster''s main girl is called Aileen and she probably has bipolarity. Sometimes she's very sweet to her girlfriend, but other times she's killing random men mercilessly. She varies from insane to wise in many scenes, so you never know what to think about her. Acting is a thing to be congratulated in here, specially Charlize Theron's; she really looks like a crazy girl (or woman). The film's biggest accomplishment is that people aren't perfect; while in most Hollywood movies they show perfect people doing perfect things, 'Monster' concerns in showing people as they really are. A self-interested girlfriend (Selby), an insane woman (Aileen), people paying for having sex, girl lying to be shopping when actually she's in a bar with other people, etc. 'Monster' gets really believable and real once they don't glamor people and life. It's just a shame that the ending isn't a tearjerker, otherwise I would've rated it around 9. Watch this big piece of entertainment and reality!",7,0,1,13 December 2011
Memento," do I have such bad taste?
","You know, this movie has everything to be an awesome movie. The main actors, Guy Pearce and Carrie-Anne Moss deserve an Oscar for such a professional acting. The originality of 'Memento' is also pleasant, I myself had never seen a similar story in a movie. But something in this plot didn't satisfy me. The story was very confusing, there are flashbacks all the time, and it becomes boring once we get lost in the mystery.I have to admit I didn't make it to the end... as stated before, once I got lost in the story it became very boring. And it's not my fault as a viewer to don't get things straight: they (the writers) are supposed to make me want to follow their thoughts, otherwise movies wouldn't be classified as entertainment.",5,8,12,3 February 2011
This Is the End," A home at the end of the world, maybe?
","Well, I had no idea what this movie was about; the only thing people told me is that it would involve a party in James Franco's house, but I'd never guess the special effects and the crazy storyline this movie have. So that's it, there is a party, and all of a sudden, we have an earthquake that transforms everything outside into pure chaos. From that point on, the film became a 'Scary Movie 4' without the funny jokes that parody had-- which is a shame. I mean, it's not that the cast didn't try to be funny, but the plot and the conversations are just too nasty and repetitive to provoke a laugh. Most of the jokes involve penis, sperm, ass and everything that the male world is always talking about when girls are not around. For this reason, I really doubt the female audience will recognize any merits in this project-- and I'm completely OK with that. The only indeed funny situation is when they make fun of Emma Watson and her unforgettable character in 'Harry Potter'. Despite that, there is not a reason for you to laugh. Also, there aren't reasons for you to feel interested in the story, since you couldn't care less about the silly 'characters'-- or personalities? Bad movie anyways, don't feel isolated if you're the only one who hasn't seen it yet.",4,0,1,22 February 2014
Hostel," I Like It Rough
","It used to be one of my favorite movies when I was a teenager; things may have changed after watching it more carefully. You know, I will not deny this is pure entertainment, with an engaging storyline, mainly if you are a boy. Cast is most of the time professional, and the mysterious plot makes it very interesting to see. Torture scenes are well done and you feel like you're the one being tortured, given that actors and director do their jobs very professionally. However, we've got to admit there are some plot holes that makes it unconvincing at times. For instance, why would Svetlana bring Paxton to the slaughterhouse to see his dead friend? Wouldn't she imagine he could run and kill the bad guys, just like he did? And more, how come nobody found out about the American carnage after so many dead people? Wouldn't the families seek for help? Wouldn't FBI interpose in that shambles? However, considering 'Hostel' did its job in delivering a tense and entertaining torture movie, this is still a good movie.",7,2,3,22 July 2013
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," So Sick
","'Crazy, Stupid, Love.' is a very known film for a reason that I don't have any idea of. The characters are somehow interesting, but the cast is just as hack as it could be, considering there's just no new actor at all. Therefore, as you can imagine, the movie as a whole is just another merchandising for those actors whose performances are almost always the same. Ryan Gosling, on the other hand, is someone I had rarely heard of, and even thought he seems to be a copy of David Arquette. Moreover, there isn't much to be said about this picture, since it didn't stay in my memory due to the uninteresting plot that has been showed. Maybe 'Crazy, Stupid, Love.' is just another movie from the Hollywood that we'll hardly remember of.",5,3,4,6 December 2015
The Babadook," Can't you see that you're smothering me...
","I went to see this movie being much aware that it was relatively scary. Well, since I know I'm very afraid of horror films, I use to ask my friends to tell me how scary it is before showing it to me, which was the case. 'The Babadook' is a STRONG film that deals with mother and child troubles-- which are common, by the way. However, in this case, their trouble is much bigger than the ordinary fights parents and children usually have; Amelia, the mother, gets completely out of mind because she notices her son is quite eccentric-- as if she wasn't either. There are a lot of scary scenes, with a plot utilizing some elements of the classic 'The Shining'-- no matter whether director confesses it or not. The scenario, also, is very dark, delivering all the Gothic atmosphere this film deserves. However, the biggest element of 'The Babadook' is the marvelous acting from Essie Davis, whose talent can be seen all the way through. Great movie!",8,4,7,30 December 2015
Ted," I'm not looking at your funny business
","Well, since almost everyone I know had already seen this picture, as it became very famous in Brazil, I decided to give it a chance. As many people had advised me, this is surely a very American comedy, with some male chauvinist messages, so if you're a woman you won't probably enjoy this as much as your boyfriend. Characters are well developed, and it is good to see such a pretty woman in the main couple. Even thought story is at many times corny, and you feel like it's just another dumb comedy, sometimes you have strong laughs, such as the karaoke scene when Ted sings only the vowels-- albeit only me and my friend laughed out loud in that cinema. In the end, I can't affirm this is a great movie, because the story is pretty cheesy and sometimes ridiculous, but if you're looking for free laughs, this may be a good choice.",6,0,2,12 November 2012
127 Hours," Death Hours
","Well, since all decent IMDb's reviewers already gave their opinions about this movie, I felt obligated to see and give mine. '127 Hours' is pretty similar to the polemic 'Buried' and came out two or three months after the second mentioned. Whilst in 'Buried' 100% of the scenes involve Ryan Reynolds in a coffin, this one alternates between James Franco's agony and flashes of his mind. Both these movies are agonizing and make the spectator feel very sorry for the main character, even thought the protagonist never showed a reason for us to like him. My main complaint about '127 Hours' is that Franco, in many scenes, seems to be TOO calm for someone who is that close to death; when people are about to die they simply get crazy-- our survival's instinct attacks. The photography direction is beautiful, this picture is surely a professional work; it's just a shame that films involving this trouble will never be completely entertaining-- it will get boring sometimes. That's it, '127 Hours' is a good movie of its subject, but is the kind of picture you have to be very patient to truly enjoy.",6,1,2,23 January 2012
Batman Returns," Batman better return again
","What a good movie!Tim Burton is a really good director. He knows how to make a decent super hero movie that both kids and adults can enjoy. The mystery, darkness and fantasy really work in this film.The cast is perfect. Michael Keaton good just like in the previous; Danny DeVito works perfectly as the Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman... do I need to say something?I just felt that missed some good scenes of Batman and Catwoman kissing. They had some chemistry. And I would had been very amazed if she kissed the girl that was about to be raped, but I just realized it's not an adult movie haha :)",9,6,12,27 January 2011
Just Go with It," Give It To Me
","Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston play two unique characters that develop a weird relationship after trying to pretend to be married. In fact, they only do that because Sandler's character wants to impress a young girl. Some scenes are interesting and creative, and so is the plot, but some things are over the top-- for instance, the stupid non-sense lies they make up all the time. Children's performance is great, even thought it seems to be one of their first works. In order to see a different ending, I admit I didn't want them to end up together-- that would be so clichÃ©d and predictable. Unfortunately they did, which is the reason why I don't give it a higher rating-- I expected some innovation in this aspect. All in all, it's a great work, congratulations.",7,2,3,24 October 2012
Orphan," Who'd thought it...
","'Orphan' is one of the most watched thriller of 2009, with huge popularity here in Brazil. Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard play a couple that adopts a child, but once the time passes, weird things begin to happen. Many stated 'Case 39' was a copy of this, but even thought the films have some similarity, in the end they're pretty different. The story is involving and at times stressing, given that this adopted girl does every evil thing she wants and nobody is able to even notice it. Most of the scenes are plausible, apart from the psychiatrist's; this 'professional' talks to the girl in some sessions, and she's NEVER able to notice that the kid is totally nuts and a serial killer. Some people stated 'ooh but the kid is crazy and smart, she fooled the psychiatrist'; come on guys, that's EXACTLY what psychiatrists are for, they're paid to find out if the patient has any disorder! Also, I found extremely funny when this 'professional' began praising Esther's qualities and slaughter the mother's behavior. I have to congratulate the make-up team for such difference they made between the Esther the kid and Esther the 33 year old woman; I blindly thought they were two different actresses. All in all, 'Orphan' isn't an excellent thriller but is a very good one!",7,1,2,6 April 2012
500 Days of Summer," Pretty. Odd.
","Like 2007's Juno, it's the classic drama where boy loves girl and something doesn't work as planned. The big thing about the story is that the girl (Summer) doesn't like to say she's dating or that they are boyfriends; to her, it's just a needless statement. She keeps saying they're just friends, even thought they apparently see each other everyday and he is very in love with her.'(500) Days of Summer' is good at showing how crazy a man can go if his love isn't matched. I myself have been in this situation for like 2 years, and at this exactly moment, I just came back from a ride with my ex-girlfriend. She has a boyfriend now, but she still keeps seducing me, creating an illusion in my heart and then she says she doesn't want anything with me. How am I supposed to deal with that? How is Tom? I don't know, he doesn't know, nobody knows! And this is a big taboo that may never have an ending, but we, human beings, have to keep on trying to find our love and our happiness.After all these philosophical and romantic thoughts of mine, I finish this review saying that this film is worth a watch but it's not changing anybody's life.",7,0,1,20 June 2011
Sleepy Hollow," Say You'll Haunt Me
","Since Brazilian's main channel television used to exhibit this movie like always, I always wanted to give it a chance, but I felt I was too young to watch it by myself. Yea, I was a scared child. 'Sleepy Hollow' shows, from the get go, how mysterious and cartoonish it will be. Johnny Deep, who I felt much like Jim Carrey, plays an eccentric police officer that needs to investigate the murderers in a small community, and as you can imagine, things aren't that easy. For some moments, I was capable to relate the story with some Scooby Doo's, except for the more mature version of the 'horror elements'. There is a great soundtrack that fits well in every moment it's utilized, proving that filmmakers were professional at producing it. The photography and overall directing are also GREAT, reflecting a big moment in Tim Burton's career. It's just very dark like some of his older works, like 'Batman' and 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'. The outcome is reasonable and somehow unpredictable-- at least for me and for Mr. Crane haha. It's just not better because it doesn't want to be taken seriously, otherwise it could've still been better. Definitely recommended, unless you feel like you're too old to enjoy innocent stories.",8,0,0,13 June 2014
Silent Hill," 'till I can get mine, satisfaction...
","I really want to understand how can someone love this film. The first hour has a very slow pacing and if it wasn't the good photography and the decent cast, I would've turned it off. Some people believe this film is scary and suspenseful... I saw this in the dawn with all the lights turned off and didn't feel scared for even a moment.. the monsters are all ridiculous and childish as they could be. Others said the ending had an unexpected twist or something. What??? The ending was nothing but a deception in every aspect, leaving the story (which was already weak) more vague than any teen slasher movie. Not to mention that the story is much similar to thousand of other movies released before 2006. Pass it.",3,0,2,12 September 2011
Crash," Crush
","Well, 'Crash' is pretty much what everyone says about it. An engaging film involving ethnocentrism, xenophobia and racism. All these issues could be resumed in one word-- prejudice. Thought the movie is centered in a big urban city of the United States, the subjects are similar to every city in this world. The characters are filled with much realism, the filmmakers were very good in their development; the background sound is also touching, matching with the mood of the film. Unfortunately, 'Crash' plains to be a little too long with so low plot, but nothing that spoils the film's accomplishments. Get a chance to see it.",7,1,4,19 September 2011
Scary Movie 2," I'm really getting old....
","This film although being so idiot, had a successful release and provided what the audience truly wanted from it: laughs.The conversations between the characters are so stupid that makes it funny. 'Scary Movie 2' is basically a spoof of all the things in our society: horror movies, teenagers, selfishness, proud, drugs, women's seduction on men and the constant seek for sex. It's funny the way they approach the women's seduction on men, that thing that makes men say yes to all the girls ask. Cindy Campbell should have won some Oscar for being the dumbest character ever!! Anna Faris really knows how to interpret this kind of persona!And you see, this film is unbelievably 9 years old.. the jokes are still current and they'll probably make you laugh (if you've seen the movies spoofed), so give it a chance if you didn't see it yet. Worth your time!",9,0,1,17 June 2011
Final Destination 2," Still digging in the middle...
","Well, the movie is clearly what everyone expects it to be. An entertaining thriller with some predictable scenes and filled with gore, just like the first one was. Fortunately, the writers were smart enough to change some things in this one. While in the first the deaths were only seen before the big accident, in this one there's a girl with premonitions of deaths even further, doing justice to it's Brazilian translation-- which is simply 'Premonition'. I just have a big problem with these explosions; making things explode in real life isn't that easy... in this film, any minimum bug makes the whole thing explode, which makes it lose some plausibility. And I have to complain the fact that Brazilian DVD has this subtitles very slow and out of time... I was obligated to see it without subtitles and ended up losing some informations. Aside all that, good movie with ridiculous end, that's all.",6,0,0,11 September 2011
Alien," Sometimes the scariest things come from within
","Well, 'Alien' is considered a cult horror classic for most people due to the impact it had when released and the impact it still causes when you watch it. I believe the main reason to this film be that high rated is the directing. Ridley Scott is marvelous; he is able to entertain, scare, shock and at the same time, give the spectator a good time. This film runs away from every possible cliché-- which is a hard thing to see in a horror film. There are some shocking scenes, such as the alien coming out of Kane's body in dinner table. In fact, I don't believe in such thing as aliens, but still felt horrified in this scene, so I can imagine how scared alien believers must have felt. Sigourney Weaver is excellent in doing her job, I didn't know she was that good. I also didn't know that they had such great technology back in 1979; special effects are well done and impressive at times. My only complaint is that the alien spends too few time on screen, but it doesn't spoil the film's overall quality. It is indeed an horror classic!",8,0,1,5 December 2011
The Book Thief," A pain in the neck or something like that
","I went to catch this movie on screen without knowing any aspect of its main plot, so everything felt brand new to me. It's important to mention that I'm not familiarized with the book either, I only knew its title because I live on Earth and everyone has already heard about it somehow. 'The Book Thief' tells a story about a girl that is 'adopted' by a German family during the World War II, so you can imagine how difficult they life may be. Not only that, but they have to hide a wanted Jewish in their basement, which deliver some tense moments. After around 30 minutes of running I discovered why the story is called 'The Book Thief', in the burnt scene, and I confess I didn't see that coming. All the characters involved in the plot are well developed and charismatic, each one in its own way, and the promising cast really helps it to flow. The photography direction is beautiful to see, delivering some bucolic scenes, usually helped by a careful overall directing. What bothered me the most was the slow-placed plot that took too long to deliver interesting moments; I mean, the film spent almost two hours to make us believe something powerful would happen, but almost all the promising scenes end up too simply-- despite the deaths scene, which was well made. For a dramatic story like this, I believe filmmakers could have given us a stronger final scene, no matter what was the conclusion in the book-- we are in the cinema anyways, aren't we? For a film to me remarkable, spectator needs more than just a regular story that happened to many people. That's maybe the reason why this movie didn't impress me that much, making me feel like there are better stories out there. In the end, some people found it extremely touching, but I didn't, even if recognizing its production values.",6,0,4,5 February 2014
Shutter Island," ... One More Time
","You know, while reading this film's reviews you get to think it's the best 2010 movie. But after really watching, you get disappointed.The cast does it's job, the director as well. The suspense is well created, the atmosphere is tense and it's very intriguing. But the conclusion of Shutter Island is similar to the end we've already seen in a bunch of other movies, such as 'Identity', 'The Others' and 'Never talk to strangers'.I strongly wished the writers of this film were a little more daring and could have had more creativity to make it more original and amusing. But it's a good watch anyways.",7,3,5,9 March 2011
Life of Pi," A visual miracle...
","The summary is the phrase that made me wanna see this picture. It's been written in the movie's cover, and considering I read good reviews about it everywhere, I decided renting it. Many people put this movie in the same level as modern classics like 'Titanic', and I think I disagree with them. The first half of the movie is completely involving, thanks to a good directing, scenario and performances. I really entered the Indian ambient and recognized beauty in everything of their culture-- and I constantly pictured young Pi as Rajesh from 'The Big Bang Theory'. The family concerns are universal and convincing, which is a good step in the story: something everyone can be related to. However, the boat scenes in which Pi has to live with the tiger didn't impress me that much. Firstly, due to the fact that the tiger felt very fake, and anyone could easily notice it was pure CGI. In fact, every animal in the ark felt computerized. Secondly, because they took too long. The ending, on the other hand, has a beautiful message about what really happened, and it doesn't let you know which of Pi's stories was the real one. Either way, the doubt is intelligent and provoking, so you'll not have a clichÃ©d outcome. In my opinion, it doesn't beat up movies like 'Titanic' and 'The Green Mile', but it's a good entertainment with some new ideas.",7,1,2,9 March 2014
10 Things I Hate About You," 10 times in a row
","After hearing lots of good commentaries involving this movie, I thought maybe it would be a refreshing teenager comedy. Its title doesn't fit with the plot or story-- actually it makes sense only in a fast scene in the end. Several moments of this picture are similar to the controversial 'Not Another Teen Movie', the difference is that '10 things' doesn't make jokes or references to other films. Heath Ledger doesn't show any differential in his acting-- people would never imagine him as the unbeatable Joker in 'The Dark Knight' years later. Rest of the cast is just okay and the plot is the classic American stereotypical, just like in the other teen pictures. Don't expect too much from '10 Things I Hate About You'.",6,2,4,21 July 2012
Nightcrawler," Push the feeling on
","You know you've seen a good movie when you constantly try to predict what's going to happen next and you always fail. That is the case, for me, with 'Nightcrawler'. This film has one of the greatest plots I've recently seen; the story is very engaging, due to the eccentric situations characters get into. I also couldn't help mentioning how good is the character development, especially regarding Louis Bloom, Rick and the female anchor. The three of them began the movie in a way, and as the story went on, they revealed to be very different from what they were supposed to be. In my opinion, the story's main objective is to show how far people can go for money, and how our materialist society stimulates this kind of behavior. Also, Jake Gyllenhaal proves in here how good is his acting, albeit many of his previous works have been badly criticized. To sum it up, 'Nightcrawler' is a pleasant surprise from 2014 and I feel very glad to have seen it in the cinema.",8,0,0,22 December 2014
American Pie," 1999 was THE year in movies
","First of all I have to say I really laughed in the scene that Jim said angrily 'I hate sex!! I've never done this I already hate it' or something like that.In the first 20 minutes, I was ready to give it a bad review. American Pie began too silly and seemed to be a movie for pre-teenagers. But after the web camera scene, it began being funny and entertaining. You know, putting funny jokes much after the beginning makes the spectator loses the interest for the film, the writers here were really brave to do that (and fortunately, it worked). It deals with many of the youth issues, such as insecurity, inexperience, curiosity and growing up. The end of the movie is mind blowing; they really made it in a way to satisfy the spectator (and me as well, of course).Also, Jason Biggs proves to be a real actor that deserves the attention he had in here. I just watched this film and right after I went to youtube to see his interviews. He is really very different from Jim, which shows he can act and leave the comfortable zone with talent. American Pie is a legitimate classic that everyone should give a try.",7,0,1,25 March 2011
The Village," People as they are
","How can this movie be soo good? It's been years since my first watch, and I didn't find this movie was all that good, but now I do.'The Village' is a beautiful story about a group of people that lived outside the civilization in a small village and only some of the older guys knew there was life out there, just like Plato's 'Allegory of the Cave'. It's interesting to notice how the love between father and son/daughter is unconditional in this film as it is (or should be) in real life. Edward Walker risked everything in that village to pursuit the real happiness of his daughter, even thought nobody supported his decision. The fear from the unknown is another thing that this movie portrays like in real life. Put yourselves in the place of them. If you were born there, and everyone told you that there was no life out there, would you not believe? How would you know if you don't have opportunity to leave? And some people here are criticizing the fact that there would be incest. If you watch this movie carefully you'll see that it's THE MOST insignificant detail. This isn't part of the message the movie is trying to show.The best movie I've watched this year undoubtedly (yes I know we just began, but anyways)",10,1,2,28 January 2011
American Psycho," Strangely odd
","'American Psycho' isn't a clichéd thriller involving a serial killer as always-- at least. This film has a weird story about a man obsessed with his body who kills lots of people, getting away with murder very strangely. For instance, there are cops and cops in front of him shooting him but they miss all the shots, while he just shoots twice or three times and the police cars explode out of nowhere. His name is Patrick Bateman and he proves to be a very annoying man, talking and talking about the most irritating things on earth. And Christian Bale isn't that good in this character; when he cried, I thought it was the character acting to fool people, but actually, it's the actor himself acting lame. Not to mention the irritating conversations about restaurants and reservations.The good thing about this film is the fact that it's oddly very entertaining; aside that, it shows no originality, surprise or strong performances, but spending 102 minutes in this isn't a total waste of time.",5,0,1,14 August 2011
The Shining," Forget about your boyfriend and meet me at a hotel room
","I didn't like this film very much. I agree it's very entertaining, well directed and has a creepy atmosphere (mostly because of the background sound and Nicholson's acting), but it is not enough to qualify this as a great horror movie.In the beginning of 'The Shining', Torrance already looked like a freak. It's not like in the book that he's a regular guy and transforms into a monster; he's just strange at the very beginning. Not to mention that the family conversations before going to the hotel were very amateurish, you could easily notice they were acting. Also, the little boy speaking with that strange voice was ridiculous; they could've made a much creepier way of speak.So that's it, the film has some good points but nothing really happens to satisfy the spectator. It's a bunch of non sense happenings. Nicholson's acting and Kubrick's directing are what make this film be watchable and respectable, since the plot/story was very weak, leading to nowhere and delivering such a bad (and frustrating) ending.",7,1,2,9 May 2011
American Beauty," Weirdo movie
","You know, this film ends up every different of how it begins. The beginning is very involving, fast paced and lots of interesting conversations. From the get go you're able to realize the movie is going to deal with a society that live for show. And it doesn't refer only to American society, I believe most of societies have these things.In the last 40 minutes or so, sadly the movie becomes kind of uninteresting and slow paced, along with many unnecessary scenes. For instance the Ricky's videotapes; what's the meaning of them? What do they add to the movie as a whole? I didn't get it! Anyways, a pleasant movie that sometimes make you wanna puke and sometimes make you wanna watch it again.",7,0,1,29 May 2011
We're the Millers," I can go for miles if you know what I mean
","Dude, I'm so surprised with such a funny movie that I'm almost out of words to express that! You know, a comedy staring Jennifer Aniston usually makes me think it's just another cheap feel good blockbuster, and considering this movie deals with the saturated subject of road tripping, I couldn't ever imagine this would be so great. From the get go, the spectator is able to notice that something refreshing is coming. The scene in which a friend of David tells him they almost ended up kissing each other after taking his first ecstasy was soo great and unexpected! Anyone who's ever tried such drug probably knows what he's talking about! From that scene on, we have great and funny moments, thanks to the great plot that writers provided us! It is really hard to make a funny film, and even with a good written story, sometimes the cast just doesn't know how to show it-- and that is not the case with 'We're the Millers'. The cast is extremely professional, reason why ALL the actors involved in this project deserve big recognition. Also, this movie avoids all the clichés that the roadtrip genre has been using for the last thirty years, delivering THE BEST work of the genre, being even more enjoyable than 1983's 'Vacation'-- that also had its moments. Furthermore, there are some pertinent references to recognized movies that have been made in the past, delivering smart jokes that film buffs will adore. All in all, I strongly hope Hollywood keeps innovating in their comedies from now on, given that for once I thought they wouldn't make anything decent anymore. Oh, and the joke with 'Friends'' theme song finished the work with nostalgia and pleasure.",9,1,4,19 February 2014
Silver Linings Playbook," The Life's Good Side
","Knowing that 'Silver Linings Playbook' won an Oscar for the best performance by an actress in leading role, I decided to give it a chance and see what's going on. The story is basically about a mentally ill guy coming back to his house after spending eight months in the hospital. In this return, everyone is willing to help him dealing with life more calmly, but things don't always work like this. To make it harder for him-- in a first sight--, Pat meets a girl named Tiffany who isn't exactly a role model of mental stability. In fact, sometimes we wonder who has a bigger mental problem, given that both characters face these problems with a considerable frequency. The good thing about that explosive behavior is that it delivers some funny scenes, like the first dinner they have together, in which they explode with rudeness to everybody gathered in the table. I don't honestly know what I felt so funny about that scene, but people acting rude all of a sudden usually makes me laugh, for being so spontaneous. The plot makes it an entertaining movie, mainly because the pace is fast and we care about the main characters. There aren't many thrilling scenes, and the climax is well reached in the dancing scene-- and deliver another funny moment, since nobody could understand why they've felt so happy after receiving a five grade. It's also good to see Robert DeNiro portraying something different than a rough father/grandfather who in the end becomes sensitive and kind; in fact, his character is reasonable all the way through the story. By the way, for some moments Tiffany remembered me a lot the character Penny from the series 'The Big Bang Theory', despite the fact Tiffany is really crazy hehe. All in all, it just doesn't deserve a better rating because it never accomplish to be too emotional, romantic or funny, but it's in no way a bad film. Also, I can understand why Jennifer Lawrence won the Oscar for having the best performance-- if I agree with that is another discussion.",7,1,1,19 February 2014
Divergent," Say You'll Haunt Me
","Well, as many people probably may have already said, 'Divergent' utilizes some elements from other recent films. The biggest example of this is the world's division by factions based on virtues, which surely reminded me of the classic 'Harry Potter' thing. However, the movie as a whole, has a different take on the subject; the main purpose of the story, in my opinion, is to show that if you are far better in doing some stuff than ordinary people, you WILL be hunted. About the romance created in this film, in the beginning it feels a little forced, but as we get to know the couple better, especially Four, the romance gets better and better. This couple faces a lot of problems, and fortunately, it doesn't look like a modern Romeo & Juliet syndrome-- FINALLY! On the other hand, 'Divergent' isn't much better than average movies due to its regular cast, which doesn't look that convincing, with exception of Shailene Woodley, who brings life to her character. The ending, although a little tragic, brings a nice feeling of love and peace, and it's always good to see people getting together after a storm of problems. All in all, it's a good picture to be seen!",7,0,0,6 December 2014
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Thriller night
","I may not be a big fan of action movies, but I can't deny this one is an exception in my taste. I just came back from the movie theater and I have to say I'm impressed with such great technology this movie has. Special effects are awesome-- which should be expected, since it has a $50.000.000 budget. Filmmakers make a parallel with the original Hansel & Gretel story, adapting this version to an older audience. In fact, this movie is indicated for all ages, except young children who are easily afraid with monsters-- makeup department (or special effects department?) makes the witches very ugly. 88 minutes is enough time to develop the story, entertain and thrill spectator and end up with a corny dialog, something we could easily expect from this sort of movie. All in all, 'Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters' is a great popcorn flick to enjoy some special effects and nice fighting scenes, but doesn't innovate that much. Update: I just checked Famke Janssen's age and she turns out to be more than 50, whilst I could swear she was in her thirties in this movie.",7,4,8,30 January 2013
Bad Teacher," Out of class teacher
","'Cameron Diaz plays a bad teacher who doesn't give an 'F''. From this tagline you can already imagine how unscrupulous this teacher may be. She is one of the worst teachers I've ever seen, and that's what makes this film funny. It's not one of those comedies that you laugh hardly until you're out of breath, but it's an ironic comedy that makes you laugh once in a while. The biggest thing is that even thought her character would be hateful in real life, the story makes the spectator actually LIKE her and hate the honest people-- which is too strange to be true. In the end, we're all hoping that this character gets away with 'murder'. Not that the movie wants to show that you should steal, lie and cheat to do well in life; the story is meant only to be funny and entertain the spectator-- and it DOES. My only complaint is with Justin Timberlake; as always, he can't act decently, and his character could be played by anyone else-- more talented, of course. All in all, this is a modern and sometimes cheap comedy that you will probably enjoy.",7,4,7,12 April 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Who I Am Hates Who I've Been
","First, I have to mention how irritated I get when I see everyone around bashing this movie, saying that Sam Raimi's work was the best and the only decent. In my point of view, BOTH productions are great for their own merits, and there is no point on bashing one just because you're fan of the other. Is it a remake, reboot or anyhow related to 2002 version? I believe it's a matter of opinion, and it doesn't really matter how it is called. The truth is that WE ALL were used to that version; we all had in mind Tobey Maguire condescending the bank robbery, hearing the clichéd 'With great power comes great responsibility', loving Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane, among another unique aspects of 2002's version. If now there are different actors and situations, that's because filmmakers are innovating and trying to develop something new-- and that's a good thing! The first scene in which Andrew Garfield stares at the world on top of the building is really beautiful and melancholic, and from that point on I could realize how good photography direction did in here. The burning car scene, for instance, proves that Marc Webb KNOWS how to deliver an impacting scene-- mainly when Parker watches the father and son meet again. I felt really thrilled in that scene. Stan Lee's cameo was quite hilarious, and I'm sure he's proud of that homage. The ending thought of 'it's all about asking who I am' was indeed smart, and I considered it original-- forgive me if it's already been used, but I'm unfamiliar with superhero movies. Great directing, great acting, great storyline and a refreshment for Spider-Man ideas.",9,1,3,23 February 2014
Aliens," Monsters everywhere
","Whilst in 1999's 'Alien' most of the time we're expecting for the big thing, this one is the opposite. We have aliens here and there every time, with much more action than the first installment. One thing to praise in this picture is the GREAT direction James Cameron showed; he knows how to make suspenseful scenes and a well built atmosphere. Actors are also very professional and do their job as we expect. Everything was going very fine to me, until Ripley decided to go back to the infested 'plane' to save that annoying little girl. It sounded SO Cliché that I almost gave up on this. Surely it doesn't spoil the movie's quality in general, but it lost some points with me after that. Also, it's irritating that when we think the movie is over, Cameron revives a monster or create a new one out of nowhere. All in all, it is a great movie, but I still stick to the first version.",7,0,0,6 March 2013
Dallas Buyers Club," Buying a new life
","A Texan straight male discovers to have HIV in his organism in the eighties, a decade in which the virus infected almost only the homosexual population. So, considering also that the disease was highly mortal in such period, I can understand the psychological problem that Woodroof gets into. However, even thought the main character begins the movie as an extreme homophobic and chauvinist, things get better when he starts dealing with the transsexual portrayed by Jared Leto. The film shows an interesting ambient in which people were desperate to get any attention from the government, which didn't seem to feel interest for anything else than money. The script is original for the most of the time, albeit sometimes remembering me of 1993's 'And The Band Played On'. Photography and overall directing are beautiful and quick, making the story flows. But, what really makes this movie good, is the exceptional performance of Matthew McConaughey, Jennifer Garner and Jared Leto, who prove all their talent while portraying such controversial characters. I'm not of those that state 'Dallas Buyers Club' is the best movie made in the last years, but it is surely very memorable and another mark for the genre. It could've still been better if there were more impacting scenes, but it never fails on being a sincere drama focused in past decades.",7,0,1,8 July 2014
The Fast and the Furious," break her heart and I break your neck
","Wow that feels good. 'The Fast and the Furious' is a classic for those who like cars and gangs with a believable plot. All the actors really seemed to be what their characters were, specially Vin Diesel's. He playing the bad boy who puts friendship above everything is really respectable and it makes the spectator likes him and his friends. Also Walker's character could be considered as a hero and someone to be looked up to, since he cared for people as they were, putting people and their considerations above his job. It was an amazing scene when he saved Vince, because Vince showed no respect and consideration for him; Walker's char could easily leave and let him die, but he saved him without nothing in return: worse than that, allowing Toretto find out he was a cop, leading him to a trouble.Toretto's sister was really sexy and we feel happy when she gets together with O'Conner. The cars were awesome and I think that everyone who watches this movie is jealous and wants to drive those speedy cars. I just didn't like how the movie ended, it was kind of disappointing to me, I was expecting much more. Anyways, a must see for adrenaline lovers.",7,3,4,27 December 2010
The Exorcist," 'The Exorcist' vs 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose'
","Well, after years hearing about this classic, I finally rented it and saw. By the very beginning, I was able to see how many films were inspired by this (not to forget Scary Movie 2 lol).I've recently seen Emily Rose's exorcism, and I notice they have many similarities and many differences between themselves. While in this classic the scares are restrained, in that they are explicit and constant. While in this the psychological horror is more intense, in Rose's the atmosphere is creepier. While in this they are more concerned in the exorcism, in the other the main thing is a debate between science and religion.Both of them are good and have different touches; in my opinion, I would prefer to re-watch Emily's to this, because of simple things as photography and special effects. But in no way I would complain about this one.",7,1,2,13 July 2011
Now You See Me," Kung Fu Panda
","I went to cinema to see this movie knowing nothing about it. The first 10 minutes already annoyed me A LOT, mainly because all the characters try to be smarty pants most of the time. The magicians are very arrogant, and so is Morgan Freeman's character, which also makes the movie tiresome. I may admit that acting is professional, and so is directing. However, the plot is extremely Hollywood and there are lots of incongruence, which only pop corn fans will accept. In fact, the final twist is one of the few acceptable scenes, whilst the rest of them are filled with people trying to be better than the other. About the exploding car scene, it was OBVIOUS that it wasn't Jack in there. About his fight against some cops, it was totally unbelievable-- I thought I was watching Kung Fu Panda instead. It's a proper popcorn flick that many will enjoy, but I sadly did not.",5,5,9,13 July 2013
American History X," Half American History X
","Brazilian's synopsis made me have a wrong idea about this film. Based on that, one expects it to be a deeply analysis of a prisoner's life. Sadly, this film is situated in jail for only some few minutes, I believe less than half an hour, which frustrated me. The whole concept is very interesting, a neo-nazi skinhead realizes all the prejudices he believed in are completely junk. I thought Derek (Edward Norton) would become good friends with some black guys and understand they're all the same, but he just shares a laugh or two with one black guy and that's it, no big thing. Also, I found Norton's acting to be kinda weak, specially when he's 'crying' in the last minutes. He 'cries' and not a single tear falls from his eyes.All in all, I believe this is a good concept with a not so rich execution. If you want to see a strong film about prejudice and racism, watch 'A Time To Kill'.",6,0,0,30 October 2011
No Strings Attached," Interesting
","Well, this is classic romantic comedy when one of the characters want to date, and the other one only wants sex. That's an ordinary issue of life, and I didn't know it was universal-- well, maybe I thought it only happened in my city. One curious thing is that usually in this kind of relationship the male part is the one who wants only sex instead of a commitment, and in this flick the girl is the liberal one. Maybe that's a tendency coming from our society to equate the genres, considering that other recent movies like 'What's Your Number?' and '(500) Days of Summer' already showed this trend. That assimilation is happening mainly in the USA, and since Brazilian's society is much likely Americans, we are advancing in the same speed. Maybe that's a sign that soon there will be no big differences between men and women. Speaking about the movie itself, it's well acted, written and directed. Nothing above the expected, and unfortunately appeals to Hollywood clichés in the end, but it's interesting to notice a difference kind of work from Natalie Portman.",6,0,1,12 July 2012
District 9," Waka Waka
","'District 9' is one of those movies that everyone talks about and you seem to be the only one who haven't seen it yet. That being said, I invited some friends over and watched it. The impression I got from the first minutes was: what an absurd storyline! I mean, aliens living (legally) on Earth feels too eccentric for my taste. However, as the movie goes, I got used with the idea. In fact, in some scenes I felt sorry for some invaders being so badly treated by humans. The movie DOES have great special effects, but its lack of thrilling moments made me feel like I was seeing another science fiction blockbuster. It's too few of a thriller. Acting is just normal. Also, maybe a better writing would've left me more satisfied. In the end, 'District 9' is nothing more than an average flick.",6,1,3,28 May 2014
Batman Begins," Swear to me
","Well I have to admit that Christian Bale is as good as Michael Keaton, both of them are what we expect from Batman.This movie is a bit hollywoodished in my point of view. It took about an hour to really 'begins' and when the action scenes were about to come, there was too much bla bla and too less action. Many people criticize Burton's movies stating that they were too fantasy and unrealistic. I think they are, but what are we supposed to see in a hero movie? Fantasy of course.I noticed many similarities with the Spider Man trilogy, such as the death of a related, the revenge seek, the pretty girl who finds out his identity in the end... But I can't deny the fact this movie was entertaining, involving and had a originality when it comes to the villain.Sadly it was a little over-length and as said before, Batman here could have helped the city much more than he did. He took years and years to become who he is now and then he saves a half dozen of people and saves the city as all the other heroes have already done. Despite that, the movie is a must see for Batman or super hero lovers.Ps: Even thought I'm not in love with this, I don't think it's overrated.",7,0,0,15 January 2011
The Fault in Our Stars," Counting stars
","Well, as the movie began, I really had my doubts whether it would be any good or not, mainly due to the quite fast-paced plot and the exaggerated character of Gus. I mean, he was only eighteen (or twenty?) years old and acted like someone too mature for his age; he was just so-good at everything. He was intelligent, well-bred, humble, good looking and so on; his character felt too unrealistic for me, and I believed the whole movie would feel that way. However, I got the opposite; everything else felt credible. The characters are well written, with highlights to Van Houten, whose quotes are funny for being too absurd. The directing is highly professional, delivering lots of intense scenes, like almost all involving the main couple. Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort are also very professional, and I can't find words to express how proud I feel for them. They, along with the marvelous directing, are what make this film so intense, sentimental, romantic and somehow, sad. I didn't feel like crying for any moment, but I heard that a lot of people did, so that's a proof of how realistic the story looks like, even if using a clichéd main plot. Some people may consider it to be an overly-sentimental picture, but I believe there are films more appellative than this in the genre. Therefore, if you're going to watch it, keep in mind that there will be some (or a lot of) romanticism. All in all, it's another great surprise in 2014!",8,0,1,12 July 2014
Twilight," Beauty and a heat
","I don't get why people are so hateful when talking about this movie. After thousand of bad commentaries about it, I finally gave it a chance-- and I don't regret it. First thing to congratulate is that they made a commercial romance with two actors out of the stereotypical-- a muscle and tall guy and a blonde perfect girl. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson are both very common people, with no artificial beauty, which makes the movie becomes closer to the audience. Also, it NEVER gets into money; the movie ends and we simply don't mind who has money or who hasn't. When the movie starts you doubt it'll ever get any good, but it does! When you almost don't believe the main couple can have some chemistry, Catherine Hardwicke makes an involving scene in which Bella discovers he's a vampire, and simply do not care. I know it is hard to run away from the simple plot of 'Romeo and Juliet', but 'Twilight' is good enough to move away from that. Mixing drama, fantasy and romance is visibly a good choice for a teen audience, I really can understand why teens enjoyed this film so much. I'm almost 21 years old now, but in my young mind I can still relate to the characters sometimes. In the end, I believe much people dislike this movie because of its annoying fan base, since movie itself is actually good. It may be a 'Titanic' for a younger generation.",7,2,8,28 January 2013
Liar Liar," Carrey's claw
","You know, the history of the movie is good. That's not just another clichéd romance between a bad father and a son without attention from his father, it had a more intelligent plot. And it's interesting that lawyers have a lying fame all around the world, not exclusively in my country.Of course I laughed in some parts when Carrey did his crazy faces spittin' at everyone, but I don't think it was fair to classify this movie as a comedy.OK fellas, now I have to exercise the bitchy side of me. The judge wasn't that believable, obviously he would have stopped the judgment when he noticed Fletcher was kind of sick. Also I don't believe that a dad would trade a son's birthday for sex. It almost denotes a plot hole to me, but the ending made up for this.",6,1,2,1 December 2010
City of God," Overly violent
","In my point of view, it has got to be one of the most violent movies I've ever seen. From the moment the murderers start, we feel like watching a Tarantino's production-- in big style, may I say. 'Cidade de Deus' is a movie that shows a violent community in 1970's Brazil, specially in the city of Rio de Janeiro, which is known by it's enormous social difference. There are plots and subplots, with a relatively fast screenplay, which is necessary to show everything they wanted to. Whilst some are used with cruelness in movies, I admit I thought this was too exaggerated, and sometimes, even implausible. For instance: why would 'Zé Pequeno' kill and hunt everybody out there and nobody could do anything? There are lots of bad guys in this movie that could have easily killed him if they wanted to, but writers preferred to let him live until the end. Other than that, there are great performances, with an engaging plot that makes you enjoy some characters, and even understand why they're going those things. It may not be a beautiful movie, but it's the biggest Brazilian production to this day, and I'm proud of that. Congratulations.",8,0,3,20 September 2013
The Little Mermaid," Life as it is
","Well, as my parents tell me, 'The Little Mermaid' used to be my favorite childhood movie. For some moments I doubted it, since I couldn't remember anything from it. Watching it now, I ended up out of words to express how much I enjoyed it. The main idea of Ariel trying to discover the whole world that there would be outside the sea is really intelligent, and encouraging for the kids. Writers involved in such storyline are VERY talented and surely deserve my sincere congratulations. The villain is well characterized, and scary as any other Disney one. One interesting thing to have in mind is that parents usually tend to teach their children what they know and think about the world, but sometimes they don't allow the kid discovering himself how things work. 'The Little Mermaid' makes you wonder about the world you live in, revealing a philosophically smart plot that should be seen in much more animated films. The love at first sight thing surely feels over in nowadays society-- mainly when you have Disney animations admitting it, like 2013's 'Frozen'--, but it is completely understandable to be seen in such old picture as this one. Also, there are some funny scenes to entertain the spectator, such as Sebastian's panic when he saw the cook decapitating all the fishes in the kitchen. All in all, it is one of the BEST animated movies I've ever seen along with 'The Lion King', and I surely recommend it to everyone.",10,2,3,21 April 2014
Insidious," Sometimes the scariest things come from within'
","After thousand of recommendations to this movie, I finally rented it and watched with some friends. Many stated this is one of the scariest movies from the last years-- and I must ratify that! Art direction and directing itself are quite professional, making the atmosphere become scary enough for you to feel like turning the television off! The colors are contrasted and confusing; James Wan 'accidently' shows some random (and creepy) faces in the dark when you're not ready for this, so you can imagine how many jumps this film may provoke. So that's it, the execution of this film is brilliant! Now I must complain about the story. If this plot was at least original, I could easily give it an 8-- but it is NOT. The get go plot is just like 'The Strangers''s, with too few differences. The table reunion scene is too similar to 'The Others' and 'Skeleton Key'. The masks are too similar to 'Saw'-- which is understandable, since Wan is the writer of that franchise. All in all, 'Insidious' is a good movie (when comparing with the rest of 2011's), but would be much better if the plot wasn't so saturated. Six is a fair rating.",6,0,0,26 March 2012
Frozen," Love don't let me go
","Well, I'm not much into animated movies, but due to the good comments involving this picture, I went to the cinema with a friend to see what's going on. In fact, there is much to enjoy about 'Frozen'. For instance, the love thing twist is one of the most courageous rupture of tradition that I've ever seen. Basically, Disney felt like showing the implausible thought of 'Love At First Sight' wasn't that acceptable in these days, showing, in here, a different view on that subject-- and that is just amazing. The characters in this movie are pretty likable, with big congratulations for the writer who invented Olaf-- my female friend wanted to bring Olaf home to live with her. The nose's carrot being given back by the moose is also beautiful to see, with a message of friendship and respecting. Besides, it's funny to notice how similar Anna is to Amanda Bynes' characters in 'Love Wrecked' and 'She is the man'. All in all, 'Frozen' proves to be a good movie, even thought still could've been better with a better plot.",7,2,5,13 January 2014
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," That's So Walter Mitty
","I went to see this movie knowing nothing about its synopsis or anything. 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' begins with a clever criticism to the social networks our lives are full of, using eharmony as an example-- albeit we all know there are examples much more impacting than that. After that, I believed the story would follow a smart way, in order to mock some aspects of today's societies. However, the movie turned to a different way; Walter Mitty has strange visions about the future-- which fail-- and travels all around the world just to find a picture to publish in a magazine's cover. That wouldn't be bad, if his trip was interesting or had any sense. I agree we have beautiful images and a strong photography direction, but there is nothing relevant to the story in his trip. Most of the traveling scenes change nothing to Walter's initial purpose, becoming very random and vague-- that's mainly why I don't give this film a better rating. On the other side, I must admit it has a pretty original story and a professional cast. In the end, it's just a regular movie that won't change anyone's life, I assure you.",5,2,8,27 December 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Friends and rivals?
","I had high expectations for this picture due to two main reasons. First: I really loved the first Webb's vision on Spider-Man. Second: Many people told me good about it-- albeit some others said the contrary. Anyways, I feel very sincere to say that it almost corresponded to my hopes. The first hour of this film is extremely entertaining, containing lots of action, drama and even humor, each one in its own way. The scene in which our hero takes the pants off of a criminal is really unexpected, reason why I instantly laughed. The relationship between Peter Parker and Harry Osborn is just as great as I could've expected. They play that classic game in which initially they seem to like each other, but, in some other times, they feel like enemies. Acting from Emma Stone is GREAT, like in the previous installment. Director has so much faith in her that basically all the emotive sentences come from her character-- which in fact touched me, mainly if considering I'm about to graduate. Besides, I feel very satisfied that a Spider-Man movie FINALLY decided to explain the issue involving Peter's parents; I mean, for those-- like me-- who have never read the cartoons, their situation was an absolute abyss. Also, I enjoyed the joke involving 'Jaws' and I had a spontaneous laugh in that scene. Photography directing and special effects are beautifully AWESOME. Other than that, I kind of agree with those who complained about the plot, since it felt rushed for some moments, but it doesn't the spoil the movie's overall qualities. 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2', even if not as great as the previous version, obviously, is a movie that I respect and recommend to anyone who enjoys this superhero. Thumbs up!",8,16,26,12 September 2014
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," All Around Me
","As this movie began, I had my doubts if it would ever become any interesting. The first half hour of the film is very slow paced, with few moments that deserve spectator's attention. However, after some while, we're given what we want: a fantasy romance. In 'The Twilight Saga: New Moon', we don't have a remarkable plot, a well written story or a professional main actor. However, we do have one thing that makes up for that: we have a GREAT directing! Chris Weitz is able to create intense scenes between the characters, even thought there isn't anything special in what they're doing; it's just the way director makes it look-- along with a sensible soundtrack. I know it may feel a little corny the way the camera goes round and round, but it simply WORKS in this occasion. Also, the photography directing is very well done, delivering magnificent scenes-- especially those made in the woods. Anyways, I know it wasn't meant to be very intelligent or anything; Twilight franchise was made to teenagers who usually enjoy creative romances and its aspects, and for this matter, the franchise is, at least until this installment, efficient. Congratulations for the team!",8,0,5,18 May 2014
Dumb and Dumber," When I thought you couldn't possibly be any dumber.......
","I remember how famous this movie used to be back when I was a young child. I remember many of my older cousins gathering to watch this flick, and I tried to laugh with them, but I couldn't understand most jokes-- not that this is an adult comedy, but I was absurdly young. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels play two goofy and naive characters that cross the country to give back a suitcase full of money to its original owner. But until they arrive in Aspen, which is where the suitcase's owner lives, they get into a lot of trouble and luckily get away with all of them. They always do something unintentional and with no fraud, ending up killing a man-- which is a very funny scene. It's been a while since I stopped laughing at comedies, considering them to be unfunny most of times, but in 'Dumb & Dumber' I had sincere laughter all the while. Congratulations for the production team and mainly to Carrey, who is the main funny attribute to this eternal film.",7,1,1,30 May 2012
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," The Boy in the Striped Dilemma
","When you're going to see a film involving prejudice, you must be ready to see a touching picture that will probably move you. It isn't any different in this case. 'The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas' is a 'simple' story that use kids to show how dumb prejudice is. Some people, including me, can't understand why people still believe that being from one religion or one color of skin are considered better or worse. Sometimes it's difficult to understand why some people are so hateful like Bruno's father, but the truth is, there are lots of people like him; in Brazilian military, there are lots of guys with these kind of thoughts. Even in academic place, like in my university, we can see ignorant people that believe in these prejudiced ideologies. All in all, this film is worth being seen since the story is well elaborated, with an engaging directing and storytelling, leaving a nice message in the end. Give it a chance.",8,3,5,19 November 2011
Evil Dead," What to say
","First, I haven't seen the original version, so I'm unable to make any comparison between them. I am here to state that this is the most horrifying, violent, nasty and cruel film I have ever seen. There are lots of ugly scenes, with blood coming from all over and people dying and being tortured for no reason whatsoever. All the cast has to be congratulated for such profession acting, specially Jane Levy, who did her job amazingly. Directing, background sound, make-up department and special effects are what make this movie so agonizing, scary and painful to see. I went with two female friends to catch this on screen, and there was a moment in the movie that they kept screaming and telling me they felt like puking, which is an example of how disturbing this movie may be. I felt it strange there were many old guys in the cinema by themselves, showing no fear or any discomfort while watching this. I am not a fan of this kind of movies anymore-- they look all pretty much the same to me. In my opinion, it is a mix between 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' and 'Cabin Fever', with no originality or innovation to the genre. However, I'm reasonable enough to admit it is a great movie for fans of the genre, and they probably won't be disappointed after seeing this.",7,4,18,11 May 2013
From Dusk Till Dawn," Vampires will never hurt you
","Well, this movie begins very violent and similar to Tarantino's movies. Killing for no reason and coldness when dealing with other people. As many people already said, this movie is basically divided in four scenes: the bar scene, the motel scene, the bus scene and the iron maiden rock bar scene. In all scenes characters act the same way, showing they've been properly developed. One implausible thing to notice is how the kids made light of their dad being about to die-- no children act like that, but I can understand it's just a horror movie. I really liked all the scenes until it became a 'Night of the living dead', full of never ending action scenes, which bores me. All the others scenes are very creative and entertaining, but the undead scenes made me rate this lower than I was ready to do. Good movie anyways.",6,0,2,10 November 2012
Jerry Maguire," yeah know what i'm doing
","Jerry Maguire is a drama-romance which seems to be just another sport movie, but it is not. It has the problems involving media, capitalism, doping, money and feelings. It's sad the movie had that clichéd part: when Jerry read the final contract that stated if the athlete had health problems the contract'd be over, I instantly knew one of these things would happen: or Tidwell would break something of his body or he would make we all think he really did when actually it was just a shock. And the second guess happened. Also, I didn't feel a good chemistry between Dorothy and Jerry - which is good, because we've already seen tons of movie where the couple is perfect and made for each other.And I feel this movie is a bit overrated, but that doesn't influence my rating since I don't think it deserved more or less than 7/10.",7,1,1,10 January 2011
The Dark Knight," Best 00's film
","Well, I'm more into the 90's Batman movies since they are pure fantasy, but I must admit this movie rocked.Batman The Dark Knight deals with many aspects of society. Corruption, human nature, goodness, wickedness, love and loyalty. Heath Ledger was just perfect at playing The Joker. Here he showed that a good actor is able to play any kind of character he's asked to. I found myself proud of him as an actor and I dare to say he (almost) did a better job than Jack Nicholson in 89's Batman.Also, it was interesting to notice how someone so thirsty for justice could go nuts when loses its loved people and go from hero to zero. Harvey Dent showed how it is possible.Overall, I am truly grateful for watching this film and now I realize this movie really deserves all the hype it has.",10,1,4,8 February 2011
Into the Wild," Beautiful like diamonds in the forest
","People have always told me good about this picture, and due to its presumably intelligent subject, I decided watching it last night. Chris is an apparently regular American guy, whose life was once designed to repeat the ordinary lifestyle. However, Chris doesn't agree with the American dream, and starts living his life in the nature. Obviously, he goes through some bad moments, which is usual to happen when submitting someone to a complete new environment. In fact, this guy never gives up on his dreams, and that's one of the qualities he has. The photography directing is amazing, developing plenty of beautiful and relaxing moments. Overall directing, on the other hand, isn't that careful. For instance, it feels extremely implausible to see Hirsch's character changing his clothes all the time-- especially because the clothes are very fancy. Sometimes it just seemed he carried a closet in his packs. As far as I know, people on trips tend to carry just a few things, otherwise, the bag would be too heavy to carry on their backs. However, this poor detail doesn't spoil the film's qualities, so I can surely recommend it to those who enjoy adventure movies, especially involving nature. Congratulations to the team!",7,0,2,2 July 2015
"Girl, Interrupted"," Film, interrupted before its ending
","After seeing the high rating of this movie on IMDb, I thought it would be at least an entertaining picture. I was wrong. Winona Ryder's character is hospitalized in a clinic with other problematic people. Nothing was too interesting or annoying for me to realize if it was gonna be good or not. Around 20 minutes of running and NOTHING happens; I get to think maybe it's one of those movies that take long time to engage, but occasionally it becomes good. Poor me. 30 minutes of running and Angelina Jolie comes by; boring character and acting. Jolie definitely wasn't a good actress back in nineties. 50 minutes of running, nothing to expect out of it, turned it off. Nothing else.",2,8,13,28 August 2012
Alice in Wonderland," Lysergic Dream
","I personally don't remember a single scene from the original Alice in Wonderland, but I know what the original story is about. Thought that one could have an educative story, I don't think this version has. Tim Burton gives a masterly direction, making the spectator feel impressed with such beautiful scenario. All pictures and colors are fantastic, you feel like someone put some hallucinogenic drugs in your drink. However, the story never engages; the plot is totally senseless and you don't know why animals and people are saying such weirdo stuff. The movie spends 80% of its time wondering if it's the real Alice-- even Alice herself becomes bored with such repetitive question. Characters have no development and you just can't get to know any of them, since characters Alice is talking to alternate every time. It's a boring movie trying to be cult, but in the end it's just a beautiful photography with no tenor.",3,0,1,17 June 2012
A Clockwork Orange," What?
","After seeing three Krubick's movies, one thing I can tell for sure: they're full of unnecessary/meaningless scenes. For instance, what is the intend of that scene where Alex lies in bed and talks to a guy (his brother maybe) with underwear only. What's the point? Actually, most scenes are random and made only to show director's skills-- oh, I found a point for that scenes! I can surely eulogize the good directing of this picture; even thought some scenes aren't important, director make them in a fabulous way that entertains the spectator. I don't know which is better, the colors and scenario or background sound-- all are great. The question involving prison and human re-education is very creative, even more if you imagine it's been thought more than forty years ago. Also, most of the cast is very professional, of course praising Malcolm McDowell's extremely well done job-- I actually can't look at him normally anymore. The same thing that happened with Jack Nicholson thirty two years ago. All in all, it's an indeed good movie, but I unfortunately felt something was missing. If you're looking for gratuitous violence with less length and better writing, see 'Funny Games'-- either versions are great.",6,1,2,28 October 2012
The Fly," The Madam of the Fly
","Before watching this flick, I was well aware of how nasty it would be, and boy, people weren't wrong on that. I admit I closed my eyes in the vomiting scenes. Seth Brundle invents a teleportation machine and tests himself on the invention, but due to Murphy's law existence, a fly accidentally goes with him in the test, turning him into a Flyman. Although the premise is a little different of mainly superhero stories, I found it undeniable to state it follows the same pattern of that stories/films. A good aspect about this movie is that main character isn't a Hollywood heartbreaker; he's a simple guy who ends up becoming a monster. The fluids coming out of his body are really really nasty, as EVERYONE has already said, so I won't be repetitive on that. Veronica Quaife, on the other hand, doesn't show much incitement in her acting, but she's at least average. In the end, even thought 'The Fly' is a remake, it has a great story with a convincing outcome, reason why it's a worth watching film anyways.",7,0,1,31 January 2014
How to Train Your Dragon," Congratulations!!
","That's what I have to say for the filmmakers.'How To Train Your Dragon' harmonically deals with many of the current social issues, such as xenophobia, ethnocentrism, racism and homophobia. It's interesting to see that Hollywood here is not only trying to provide entertainment and money for themselves, but also trying to give some good messages for the kids who are the future of this world.Despite some slow scenes in the beginning, this film was quite entertaining and I bet kids would be amazed with the dragon stuff. I'm about to recommend it to all my cousins' children who are thirsty for animation films and some time to spend with their friends.",8,0,0,9 March 2011
Eyes Wide Shut," Very Kubricky
","Tom Cruise's character is a strange person. Although he may be very intelligent since he is a physician, in many scenes he shows the spectator he is not that sane. Many of his actions in this picture aren't totally normal. For instance, who would accept to enter in a hooker's house and after deciding the price, go away because the wife gave a simple call? It's not common among men. Nicole Kidman's is an even crazier character, and sometimes it's annoying that sex is the only thing she talks about. I don't think the story is very plausible or reliable, but I can admit it is original. The main thing that keeps this movie working is the exceptional DIRECTING. Kubrick, as usual, makes the slow story become very entertaining, and even shocking the spectator when the scene could be totally uninteresting. The scene of the mask laying in the pillow was pretty intense, I got even scared when this scene began-- and see, this isn't an horror movie or anything. All in all, even thought the poor ending, 'Eyes Wide Shut' is a good movie due to the professional directing and the original story, but don't have extreme expectations from this...",7,0,0,14 March 2012
Pretty Woman," Hollywood as it is
","I decided to see this film since many people were comparing this to 'Ghost'. Let's be reasonable, Ghost is a classic about eternal love which I liked much more than this one. Several IMDb users have said 'Pretty Woman' is a touching story about a true love. I disagree with that; in my opinion, this film is very light and obviously fictional. Everyone in the story is gentle, loyal, kind and respectable, which I would like to be true, but unfortunately, this kind of society doesn't exist. Everyone would judge Richard Gere's character and Julia Roberts' would not be welcome in her boyfriend's group by any possibility. But, as far as it's Hollywood and this is a romantic comedy, I can deal with that. See this film only if you're really curious and if you want to really understand how 'Ghost' is a perfect one. Otherwise, don't give this original yet fake romance a chance.",7,0,0,28 September 2011
The Descent," Just a regular zombie flick
","This film begins very slowly, but once the girls get into the cave, it becomes more entertaining. We don't get to see many plot holes, the acting is okay, but it has nothing that we haven't seen before.Blood, people going crazy when they are scared, human-monsters, darkness, everything already used in lots of horror movies. And it wasn't even scary this time, I remember just having a jump when they first saw the 'zombie'. And the writers trying to portray Juno as the bad girl was ridiculous. Wasn't convincing to me.The ending was also disappointing. Come on, there isn't even an ending. We don't know if the girl ended up alive or not, the director just fooled us when the girl 'dreamed' she got away by car.",6,1,3,16 February 2011
Pulp Fiction," The original gratuitous violence
","I have to admit this movie has a great cast, a great cinematography, entertains and has some good conversation, but what's up? There is nothing more: just a bunch of people killing each other for no apparent reason. I now think that Michael Haneke may had been inspired by this film to make 'Funny Games', the scene where L. Jackson kills some guys in the kitchen is very racking just like FG. Bruce Willis plot is the most interesting of them all; he steals the show with a great acting and a enviable self confidence. This is probably his best performance.So that's it, if you're looking for some free entertainment and some 150 minutes to spend, give it a try. I kind of liked but it's lack of point is a shame. Don't think you're alone if you found this movie pointless.",7,0,2,23 February 2011
Titanic," Collide With Destiny
","After all the hype some friends of mine did about this movie and considering I saw only the last scenes a couple times, I did everything I could to get this movie on cinema. Sadly it stayed in my city for only 2 weeks and I could see it only today-- I had to go to a city 2 hours away from mine to catch this. In the first scenes I could see some cheesy lines and overacting-- mainly from DiCrapio and Paxton. After the first hour, the cheesy lines became less aggressive and I could stop remembering all the time that it is just a movie. The story is so well done that you feel inside the ship. They made a 3 hours plot so interesting and entertaining that you feel the movie just ended too fast. The relationship between the main couple-- although repeating the same old formula from Romeo and Juliet-- seems so realistic that we get jealous and want to have the same feeling they have. Unfortunately, it's not that easy to find someone you truly like in real life. One remarkable quote is when Jack says 'Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me'; you see, Jack was suffering with cold and about to die, but he still thought that dying would be worth it after the strong love they had-- which is, in my opinion, one of the most emotional lines in cinema history. Special effects are also quite good, some scenes are IMPOSSIBLE to explain how they've been built-- 3D or not. The story is all completely sad and painful to imagine, and you'll probably be very sad after seeing the whole picture, but will make you cherish your life even more. People can say whatever they like about 'Titanic', but this is still a BEAUTIFUL movie to enjoy and comment with your friends for the rest of your life. Do your best to catch this on screen!",8,1,3,28 April 2012
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Hungry for the power
","Well, this first installment brings us to the get go of Potter's life. I thought they would make a too big introduction until we get to the action, but fortunately the writers knew how to make a reasonable time for introduction-- and were able to not make it a boring moment of the film. Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert show in the very first version of the franchise how talented they are, and I'm pretty sure production team already knew they would never disappoint-- and in fact, they never did. 'Sorcerer's Stone' the whole time tries to make you believe Snape is the bad guy, giving clues he's the one trying to steal the stone-- when in fact, it's another random professor. Special effects are decent for such year it's been released, but for the high budget they had I thought it could be a little more realistic at times. Rest of the cast is good and I don't have one name to flame all around. From now on I'll be seeing the next episodes, and I hope it continues this good!",7,0,1,24 May 2012
Psycho," Psycho Killer
","I went to see this movie with no big informations about it-- I only knew it was directed by Hitckcock and had a scary shower scene. I didn't even know it was black and white. Let's start praising the story: it is completely original and surprising. No one would guess she'd be killed by Norman, nor would imagine this guy had a double personality. All scenes are very entertaining, specially in Norman's house. Directing does its best to thrill the spectator, and I can affirm that two or three scenes are quite scary and suspenseful. I really don't know what else I can describe about this movie; this is excellent and everyone should watch it at least once. Period.",9,0,0,3 December 2012
Rosemary's Baby," gotta be kidding me...
","I really don't understand those who loved this film. It's entertaining, I admit it, but the outcome and the horror genre in here are mistaken. It's basically 136 minutes of conversation, questions and mystery. Nothing happens in this movie; just like in 'The Ghost Writer', we spend the whole film waiting for something and it ends poorly. How can you not have a single jump in a two hours long horror movie??? There was just one scene in the end that I thought was a little suspenseful; it was when Rose was messing with some towels in a closet with a camera that kept fading to black. But, unfortunately, like the rest of this movie, it doesn't fright or scare. If you want a movie similar to this and actually good, go see 'The Owen' (either original or remake, both are great).Now about the acting... is that for real?? Mia Farrow really sucks!!! Her acting is laughable, there are girls in my neighborhood that may act better than her. 'Rosemary's Baby' is really a shame for movie industry (and for IMDb for such high rating).",3,3,14,14 March 2011
Zero Dark Thirty," B.y.o.b.
","Before I started watching 'Zero Dark Thirty', I thought it was going to be one of those never ending thrillers filled with American propaganda. However, I had to see it myself to be able to state: it is not. From the get go, this film tells us the circumstances behind Bin Laden's capture (or murder?), and that's what makes this movie so impressive. Also, writers are smart enough to create some over-realistic characters that fit very precisely in a movie. In my opinion, Maya is too indestructible to be real, and she is written like a superhero character who everybody cares about. However, the actress Jessica Chastain indeed STEALS the show with such performance, bringing life to her character. In fact, that's one of the strongest characters I've seen in years, and it feels refreshing to see that Hollywood has finally given such duty to a woman. Furthermore, the directing is very present and tries everything to entertain the spectator, which never fails; scene after scene, I was just wondering why I took so long so give it a chance. People are free to say whatever they want to about the United States' actions and it's politician vision, but I doubt they are able to bash the technical elements in this picture, since they are nearly perfect.",9,1,4,20 April 2015
The Green Mile," A Picture To Remember
","I believe I'm one of the few human beings that had no idea of what is movie was about. I heard a lot about this picture, of course, but I didn't even know what the main story was. Maybe it's a plus, since it allowed me to see the entire thing without knowing what was gonna happen next. Well, like other death row movies, this one really touched me; ending with people lives, despite what they've done, is a sad subject for me. It must be the most terrifying feeling to know you're going to be killed in a matter of minutes. Preparing yourself for the electric chair might be even worse. As a thrilling Stephen King's story, 'The Green Mile' brings an innovation-- this time, a character has a special gift of healing people, like a saint. It is indeed beautiful to see that big and apparently bad guy helping people as he can. Filmmakers are mean in this case-- they make you adore the character, just to kill him in the end and let you down. It happened to me as well, I cried in the end and it is not a common thing for me-- so by that you can imagine how strong this movie is. A masterpiece in matter of acting, story and life.",8,3,4,18 November 2012
Jaws," We're gonna need a bigger boat
","Yea, 'Jaws' is considered a classic for many people. I admit this is my first time seeing this, and I'm not that amazed as people say this movie makes you be.The first hour is not that interesting and nothing much really happens. Just a bunch of old people talking and talking. The movie actually isn't interesting until you finally see the sea monster. The actors do their jobs very well, but the writer could have made it with more action; that's one thing that ruined it for me.Spielberg's direction is great, but 'Jaws' is not changing anybody's life; it's just pure entertainment with the ending we wanted to see.",7,3,4,9 July 2011
Inception," I Should Have Known
","'Inception' is for sure, an extremely original movie with a very professional cast and a wonderful photography direction. The background sound is phenomenon, it helps the suspense and the pacing of the movie. But what's the matter of all these things, when the film is extremely uninteresting and confusing? Christopher Nolan has this problem. I can easily compare this one to 'Memento'. Both have the same good things, but fill me with boredom and lack of interest, so I wasn't able to watch either films to the end. Maybe Nolan should let someone write his movies and he only directs; that would make them much better. Do not even consider seeing 'Inception' if you didn't like 'Memento', period.",4,4,6,9 September 2011
The Shawshank Redemption," some things are better left unsaid, but i can't hold it on
","The Shawshank Redemption is a beautiful film with a perfect cast and a wise plot. It had its good times, had entertainment and lead us to some reflections about life. Sadly it had some predictable conversations and seemed to be just another Morgan Freeman's movie. It dares to almost offend our intelligence the fact that the prison officers didn't check that poster carefully one single time in twenty years. And I have two questions: was the American justice that weak back in 1994? Were the condemned all smart and good people as this movie portrayed?If it deserves to be at 1st spot here? Maybe. If it became one of my favorite movies? No, just a good watch.",7,0,0,18 January 2011
The Conjuring," Yay
","Well, this is one of the deepest exorcism movies since the 1973's classic and of the scariest since 2011's 'Paranormal Activity 3'. There are lots of scenes and situations that are similar to these films I mentioned, but there are also lots of James Wan's own ideas. There is a terrifying scene in specific that I considered well done; it was when the mother was looking for his daughter, who was in the other room, when all of a sudden someone claps from inside the closet, when, actually, there is nobody there. That scene creeped me out and remembered PA3's scene in which the nanny sees the sheet getting up, with nobody underneath. I cannot say 'The Conjuring' brings new ideas for the genre-- that is already saturated, to say the least--, since it utilizes aspects of plenty of movies, like 'Paranormal Activity', 'The Exorcist', 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose', 'Dead Silence', 'Insidious', among others. However, I can state this is a good movie if you're looking for adult suspense gathered with horror and religion.",7,0,1,15 October 2013
Scream," At the top of your lungs
","Seventeen years passed since 'Scream' was originally released, and watching it now made me notice how current it still is. This movie is very metalinguistic, criticizing the way horror movies have been made throughout the years, making fun specially of whodunit thrillers, like 'Prom Night', among others. It's important to remember that even thought 'Scream' criticizes those movies repeatedly, big part of the plot follows horror movies rules. Also, instead of trying to change the way horror movies are portrayed, it basically recreated the genre, delivering MANY other films with these characteristics, like 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' and 'Urban Legend'. One big thing to understand is the fact this movie created lots of others that are considered classics, no matter what the critics say. You know, how would feel life nowadays if we didn't have the great 'Scary Movie' franchise? Sometimes Wes Craven ends up making fun of himself, which shows he's not all that prepotent as people state he is. All in all, albeit 'Scream' feels corny and predictable at some points, we have to consider its HUGE importance to the world cinema, in general. Congratulations for the team involved in this picture.",8,0,0,26 September 2013
Prometheus," Alien trip
","Given that I highly enjoyed 1979's 'Alien', from the same director, I believed this one would be even better-- mainly due to the great technology they have nowadays. However, things didn't happen as I wished. 'Prometheus' begins with a promising story, good cast and beautiful photography. As the movie goes, sometimes we have some philosophical thoughts about life and its creation, which led me to believe it would be a thrilling moving in the end. I am not saying this movie is bad, but with such cast and budget, it could've been a million times better. There are no big suspenseful or thrilling scenes; in most of them director prepares us to buy the premise, and when it's time for us to get frightened, or moved, or anything, it fails. The only scenes which really entertained me were when that girl took the alien out of her stomach and when the alien went into a guy's mouth; other than that, nothing strong really happens. I can honestly say 'Prometheus' isn't what everyone was expecting, and that's a shame.",6,1,1,18 February 2013
Halloween," It ain't over till it's over
","When I get to read critics about current horror films, people usually mention something involving the classic 'Halloween'. For this reason, this movie has always caught my interest, and last week I finally watched it. One thing that remarked me was the anticonventional directing; John Carpenter proves to have an unique way of filmmaking, and that really impressed me, along with the visible care he has taken while doing it. The plot varies from being slow to quick, so it feels hard to say if it takes long to become interesting; either way, I felt entertained for most of the time. By the way, whilst things were going on, I could easily notice how inspired, in this film, 'Scream' was. Sometimes I thought it was just a 'Scream' version without the press intervention. The soundtrack is very 70's and it feels nice to see a movie made in a decade when false scares weren't used in horror projects. That being said, in resume, I admit that 'Halloween' is an indeed classic that deserves all the recognition it (still) has!",8,1,2,18 February 2015
Carrie," Weirdo Freakshow
","I don't know what is so good about this movie. It's basically about a girl who suffers bullying and kill everyone that tried to kill her in the last 15 minutes. There is no art, story, plot, development, there is nothing. We also are obligated to hear Carrie's mother talking about sins and god every 10 seconds, even though nobody wants to hear about it. That's a shame some people on IMDb think it's a masterpiece of art, since it brought nothing new to me and I will forget about this movie in a few days. But maybe it's just a matter of year. I mean, we are in 2010 and maybe now this movie is absolutely out of quality, but maybe back in 70's it was a great innovation for the movie industry. Just maybe.",5,1,7,16 December 2010
The Iron Giant," What a great movie
","After some time of reluctant I decided to watch this animation movie. Hogarth is a young boy that makes friends with an iron giant who seem to be a danger to the country. USA's army tries everything to stop the giant, since they believe it's a threat to them. But, Hogarth being his friend and knowing it's not a danger at all, tries to hide the 'monster' from the government agent-- which eventually fails. In the beginning I couldn't believe this picture would have such emotional ending, so it's a great surprise for me. The theme this film used has been done many times in movie history, but it is still a worth while and entertaining version. Those who only think about war, killing and protect from the 'enemies' should give it a chance and maybe change their minds-- especially army people who become paranoid once they get into the corporation.",7,0,0,14 May 2012
The Woman in Black," Oh god
","Stating how awkward it is to see Radcliffe doing something other than Harry Potter is something I'm not doing since I can imagine how many people already did that, so I will stick to the film itself. 'The Woman in Black' is a poor movie that uses the concepts of various recent horror flicks. The haunted house is from 'The Haunting'; the strange 'person' behind the scenes is from 'The Strangers' and the small village investigation with only one cop thing are from 'The Wicked Man'. By that you can clearly see this film has NO originality at all. I can't say anything about the photography direction since the place I've seen this film doesn't have great quality. Directing does it's job in trying to scare, but it is not easy to scare the spectator when he has nothing to be afraid of. In fact, the woman in black is an irrelevant character that could not exist and the film wouldn't be any better or worse. All in all, in my humble opinion, this is a big failure that won't be remembered in a matter of months.",3,2,4,4 March 2012
The Silence of the Lambs," Side by Side
","The Silence Of The Lambs is one of those movies that you don't ever want to be finished. The story/plot is intriguing, involving, interesting and makes you stay in the edge of your seat. The crazy characters are very believable and I was very afraid when Clarice was going to meet him for the first time.Anthony Hopkins did a great job at portraying a nuts psychiatrist and sociopath. He did so well that I find it hard to imagine him as a normal person outside the movie.Ted Levine was as good as Hopkins at portraying another crazy man. Also, he was very brave to play a 'transsexual' man back in 1991 when nobody knew what it was about.The creepy feelings we get throughout this movie are worth a watch in a rainy dawn, I surely recommend this to thriller lovers.",10,3,5,19 January 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Exile on mainstream
","Wow, I'm totally speechless and have no idea where to begin! After thousand of praises to 'Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight', along with four years of expectation, Christopher Nolan couldn't disappoint the spectator in any way-- and in fact, he doesn't. The story begins with subplot happenings and Wayne giving up on his Batman thing-- I know it doesn't sound particularly original, since Spider Man trilogy already used this hindrance a few years ago. The town this time gets in panic due to the massive destruction the villain Bane has been causing to Gotham city. Art direction portrays Bane with a scary face that makes him look like Hannibal, which helps making the spectator fear the villain. Catwoman is well portrayed by Anne Hathaway-- who would imagine she could play a so sexy character with brilliance. Her utterances are very erotic and deliver an interesting Catwoman, maybe in the same level Michelle Pfeiffer did ten years ago. 'The Dark Knight Rises' is a STRONG movie made with excellent special effects; it has 164 minutes of intense atmosphere and story telling, restraining the spectator from blink his eyes. Everyone in the cinema was extremely entertained with the movie, and it's one hard thing to do when you have three hours of running. The movie is filled with plenty of beautiful messages and profound philosophical thoughts. I can't deny I still preferred Tim Burton versions which had much more fantasies and much less action scenes; Burton built a strong scenario to entertain both children and adults, whilst this Nolan's trilogy is declined to an older audience. Not that it is any bad-- it is actually GREAT-- but they had more spirit of the cartoon. Other complaint of mine is that some fighting scenes are lame and we can see they aren't really fighting-- with such budget and great production I believe Nolan could've been more careful in this aspect. Aside that, the movie is still VERY entertaining, thrilling, startling and emotional, be prepared to watch something deep and sometimes painful to watch-- I have to confess many dudes cried in the end of this picture, and I didn't just because I hardly tried not to. Watch it in cinema and you certainly won't regret!",8,2,4,27 July 2012
Signs," Very good
","Do you guys believe I haven't ever seen this film before? We are in 2011, this movie had a hype for years... I just saw yesterday because a friend of mine told me it was scary to the bone.It is not fake, this movie is really scary and frightening, much more than 'The Sixth Sense' and 'The Village'. The cast is average, I saw no big acting. The story is intriguing, involving and when the director wants to startle the audience, he does it very well. The knife scene was so intense that a girl friend of mine kept screaming for some seconds, while I was motionless because of it's impact.Also, it is interesting and real the fact that some religious people start questioning their own faith in God when some relative dies. And it is understandable that the ex father didn't want to pray anymore, he was frustrated with his 'god'. The twist in the end was interesting and unexpected also, Mr. Shaylaehoasdebna did it again!!",9,0,5,1 February 2011
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Woodypecker
","Well, this film has everything you may expect from a Woody Allen one. There are antagonist characters that deliver interesting situations, like how Vicky treated Juan Antonio when they first met, and how, ironically, things lead to a way that they end up in bed. One interesting thing to notice is how all the characters are elegant and respectful-- with exception of Maria Elena. This is the third movie I see from Allen, and I admit that this one has the best characters. The plot is very ironic, such as the soundtrack, delivering intentionally funny scenes. Also, Scarlett Johansson really impressed me with such beauty; I didn't know she was THAT cute, even if everybody kept telling me that all time. So, that's it; 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' is a very provocative picture that entertains, makes you laugh and deliver a nice ending, as you may have expected from an Allen production. Good choice!",7,1,2,23 May 2014
The Sixth Sense," Boring but clever ending
","This movie had all the hype when released eleven years ago and I never gave it a chance to watch. Today I did.I thought it was going to be a really scary movie, not just some drama mixed with a few suspenseful scenes. The actors do their jobs, but the plot isn't interesting and takes too long to develop something.I was gonna rate this movie really low until the twist in the end was revealed. I NEVER on Earth would imagine that Dr. Malcolm Crowe was one of the dead people Cole was seeing and talking to throughout the film. But it wasn't enough for me to consider this movie great, just a little better.",6,0,1,31 January 2011
Flight," Another way to die
","'Flight' is movie that, albeit having scenes involving a flight, is about a man more than an object. The plane crash is just an excuse to bring the story of Whitaker's life, which is full of problems, like alcoholism, drug addiction, bad parenting, etc. This story felt particularly touching for me, considering I have lots of relatives with drinking problems, so if you also do, be prepared to see something kind of heavy. Denzel Washington's acting is OK but, in my opinion, the one who steals the show is Brian Geraghty; the scene in which Whitaker comes into his hospital bedroom proved that Geraghty KNOWS how to perform a serious scene, mixed with a lot of feelings. Directing and soundtrack are just regular, and maybe that's why 'Flight' doesn't seem to impress spectator in any moment. I believe that a stronger directing and a louder soundtrack could have made this film a lot better. All in all, this isn't anything remarkable and the ending may be a let down for some, but it's an entertaining picture to be seen and reflected about.",7,1,1,18 December 2014
Final Destination," Great film
","Well, 'Final Destination' deserves a good review for many aspects. It's originality, entertainment and philosophical thoughts. I personally began being fascinated with death and its similarities after a car accident, where me and my three friends didn't even get hurt. Our car went upside down and we didn't get even a scratch, which made me reflect about life for months. I was looking forward to seeing this movie for long time expecting it to deal with death, destiny and human will for survival, and it did exactly as I wanted to. I don't believe in such things as design and so, but a good movie like this one makes you reflect that it could exist. And if it exists, we will surely fight for ours lives.I thought the ending was a little silly, but the movie made up for this.",8,1,1,1 February 2011
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Dream On
","Well, I've been a fan of horror movies for a long time, but for some unknown unreason, I've postponed my watch on this classic until yesterday, when I finally got to see it. I must say I'm really surprised with such good project; everything in here works well. There is a great and creepy story, in which the neighborhood kids start dreaming with a dead psycho, who tries killing them during their sleep. Along with such original and creepy story, we have a professional directing that warily does its job; there are tense songs in the very scenes they are required. Also, this film never manages to get boring, considering that spectator easily gets involved in the thread. The acting is, on the other hand, sometimes a little shallow; in some scenes it was evident that the cast was overacting, especially in the scenes related to Tina and her mother. However, out of the horror classics I've seen, 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' is the one that surprised me the most, beating films like 'Friday the 13th' and 'Halloween', reason why I strongly congratulate Wes Craven and everyone involved in this, for such achievement. Thumbs up!",9,0,0,2 April 2015
The Truman Show," Freakshow
","Well, this film is much different from the most. The story is very original and well thought, but I don't think it was well executed. The director doesn't seem to be capable to provoke any emotions in the spectator until the last 20 minutes, which for a drama film, is a shame. The things happen too randomly and non-sense until around 70 minutes of running, which made me very bored and lost in the story. The soundtrack isn't touching neither deep, so the film isn't comedy, isn't drama, isn't anything! Also, this is a much improbable show, since no decent country would have laws to allow it. Also, tying yourself in the boat isn't very smart, since the boat could turn upside down and you'd drown to death.It is surely filled with philosophical thoughts and questions, but they do not seem to fit in the film. The only things that made me happy are the last minutes, the originality and the cute old lady's couple lol. I think 'The Truman Show' is one of the famous called 'overrated' movies. A remake of this with a better director and cast would be reasonable and exciting-- at least for me.",5,0,3,16 August 2011
50_50," Dysentery
","Well, I'm just out of words to express how much I disliked this movie. The main reason for that is due to the unrealistic plot the writers delivered us. To begin with, the way doctor told him he had cancer was too rude to be true; any physician in the world would be a little more careful in telling that. Also, the female doctor's visit turned out to be completely unconvincing-- which doctor would eat and spread junk all around his working room? If that wasn't A LOT, that character was extremely boring and annoying; she was all the time like 'err, you know, that's OK, good', trying to convince Gordon's character he had stress in his mind. Besides, Gordon's character was VERY irritating in trying to pretend he had nothing-- who on earth would act that inexpressive after the news he had been told? Fifty minutes were enough for me to give up on this, and that is sad. Just a bunch of relatively 'cool' songs à la 'Juno' won't hide the movie's emptiness, my friend. Just to point, this is nothing against Joseph Gordon-Levitt-- all I know about him is that he was in some Batman movies.",3,2,5,7 January 2014
Cube," Life?
","'Cube' has been one of my favorite suspenseful movies since I first saw it, and last Saturday I just confirmed the reason why. This happens due to the GREAT storyline that has been written; the philosophical thoughts are extremely well done. I've read a thousand of theories throughout the years on the internet, and, until now, there is no official response to who was behind this big engineering. The main question that every spectator asks himself is: What was it all about? And that's what makes it diabolically good: the uncertainty. Also, the actors are very professional-- even if unknown in mainstream--, giving life to all the good characters that have been written. I have no doubt that 'Saw' was inspired in this cult horror gem. All in all, 'Cube' is an original, scary, suspenseful and philosophical film that deserves all the recognition it has, and I really doubt that filmmakers will elaborate anything as good as this picture-- mainly if considering that nowadays' horrors only repeat what has already already done. Thumbs up!",10,0,2,2 October 2014
Easy A," Cool
","Well first I would like to congratulate the writers of this film. It's sociologically very well written and show no lies about relationship between teenagers.It's interesting to see a movie that doesn't show that inexistent high school people with much older actors and stuff like that. 'Easy A' gets to the many issues in society and mainly in youth in general. Guilt, reputation, need to acceptance, gossips, sex, envy, religion and the list goes on and on.Emma Stone is an ordinary actress, her character isn't that likable but isn't hateful. Amanda Bynes for once in her life gets out of the nice girl zone and becomes a spoiled girl alienated by religion, even thought it's clear to notice she's just jealous of Olive.Good film, go see it!!",8,0,0,19 April 2011
Aladdin," Magic and love
","More than ten years without watching this movie made me feel like I have never seen it at all. I'm just out of words to express how impressed I am with such great material. The nineties were surely an amazing decade for Disney. Aladdin is the typical poor-but-good guy that falls in love with the classic rich girl-- Romeo and Juliet main issue happening again, which is an inevitable cliché. Every scene is filled with magic, beauty and nice songs to entertain the spectator, no matter one's age; everyone in this world is capable of enjoying the reasonable and naive plot this film has. 'Aladdin' is indicated for fathers, mothers, children and the whole family!",9,1,1,13 October 2013
A Walk to Remember," Remember her
","An extremely aggressive bad boy meets girl and changes every single thing in his personality when he falls in love with her. Not that I find it impossible to happen, but it is very Hollywood. I have nothing against its main plot, but 'A Walk to Remember' is one high holy temple for girls, they are always stating how awesome this movie is and bla bla bla. I do like romances, but this story sometimes feels to be too fast. One minute they meet, one minute they fall in love and one minute she tells him she's about to die due to cancer. Some scenes are inspiring, I admit it, but nothing that will make this film any perfect. In matter of romance, I think 'Titanic' is a thousand times more intense than this, not to mention the power of the main plot. That's it, 'A Walk to Remember' is an inspiring movie (sometimes), but has nothing else to offer to the audience.",6,0,0,4 May 2012

What do the three of the killing spree dudes have to do with each other? Why do people on this movie take lots of shots and don't die? Who is supposed to be in the good side of this movie? Why does it have to long two full hours? Why even the father kills people? What is the meaning of the movie? What kind of geek enjoys this kind of movie? How did you guys could watch to it for two entire hours? By the end of the first hour I was crazy for it to end.I will consider these five stars for the dialogs that are amazing and for people who thinks it's better than the own comic book.

True Romance," Let me blow your mind
","'True Romance' is a movie that people usually talk good about, and last night I could finally watch it myself and find out why it's so well recognized. The very first scene reveals what is the main quality of it all: the cast. Actors involved in this project are quite professional, so any normal scene becomes very entertaining. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette play a couple that is supposed to be the villain of the story, but due to its inexplicable power of captivating, becomes the movie's main stars. Even thought they do a lot of bad things throughout the story, every time they seem to be in danger-- or every time they're getting beaten up--, I felt extremely thrilled-- and sorry for them. Furthermore, this picture runs with a GREAT soundtrack, which sometimes mutes the characters without spoiling the movie's speed; on the contrary, it gets more and more entertaining and... cooler! The only reason why I don't give it a higher rating is because of its surfeit of violence; sometimes I believe Tarantino could have been calmer in this romance, but it's still one of his memorable works.",9,3,4,2 December 2014
Her," Her Thing
","Considering everyone has been saying good things about this movie, I invited a friend over in order to check what was going on. However, for the first sixty minutes the story is slow paced, so you need to be very patient to follow the plot's intention. I mean, the relationship between Theodore and her started as a bizarre commitment, making me feel embarrassed instead of moved. Things start getting interesting when Theodore meets up an alternative version of a prostitute, delivering a controversial scene. But, the real moment in which spectator becomes able to understand the real drama is when Theodore finds out that his relationship isn't unique; everyone around seems to be in love with such operation program. So, from that point on, the film becomes sad, running away from most formulaic plots we may have imagined in the get go. The movie probably wants to criticize the syndrome we have for technology and smart phones, whose companion may substitute a human one for some people-- which is not my case, fortunately. So, in my point of view, 'Her' is a futuristic drama involving nowadays subjects that should be interesting for everyone.",7,0,1,6 May 2014

","Mark Zuckerberg (character) is an unfunny version of Big Bang Theory's Dr. Sheldon Cooper. He speaks too fast, doesn't care about anyone else, is extremely arrogant and seems to be unfamiliar with any kind of ethics. 'The Social Network' is a film that shows how the facebook website was founded and the issues that happened between the creators-- I don't know if the story of this film is real or fictional, but I really don't care. The actors are pretty decent, with exception of Justin Timberlake that doesn't look like an entrepreneur at all. Actually, he doesn't fit in any kind of character; he should maybe just stick to his singing career. Sadly, this David Fincher's movie suffers from the same problem of all his other works: it's too long. They don't have enough interesting story for 120 minutes, just like 'Se7en' and 'Fight Club'. I believe David Fincher likes to extend his films for some unknown reason-- even thought there isn't enough plot for that. In fact, there isn't any character that you can admire or at least like, so I just went them all to drop dead and end this whole mess.All in all, this seems to be just a Hollywood flick with a new subject, made for those interested in pure entertainment and nothing else. For those it may work, but for me, it didn't work even as pure entertainment...",5,1,2,26 October 2011
The Great Gatsby," Our time now
","Well, first I dare to admit that I don't remember seeing such a great photography as I saw in this film. The scenario is magnificent, with beautiful colors and the highest definition I've ever seen on blu-ray. However, the movie as a whole isn't that 'great'. First off, Gatsy isn't an interesting character; there is nothing palpable in his personality. Also, we don't get to know much about him, or why he acts the way he does, delivering a vague main character. Maguire's character isn't anything to be remembered; he seems to be just a Gatsby wannabe, and I don't see a reason why-- and neither does he. The plot is very crazy and nonlinear, turning the story into pure fantasy without many reality. The soundtrack can be considered good. Also, the soundtrack is authentic; there are some weird covers of 'Crazy in Love' and 'Back to Black'. Maybe just too much of Jay-Z. In the end, I couldn't say if this film was comedy, drama or romance; it has everything but, at the same time, it has nothing! However, I give it a 6 in respect of the wonderful scenario and the dynamic direction, which the lack of would turn this into a great deception!",6,1,2,25 May 2014
Warm Bodies," Hollywood Undead
","You know, once this film began, I couldn't possibly imagine where it would go, since the main story's premise felt too crazy to develop something interesting. I may admit that, until the 30 minutes, I had no big excitement or reason to keep watching it, but I went on-- and I did the right thing. Julie is a beautiful girl who happens to meet the zombie named R-- because he actually can't remember his name--, and for some reason we can't figure out, she starts having feelings for him-- maybe because he ate her former boyfriend's head? Not only that, but R begins to act more like a human, also starting to have feelings, leading to something like 'Bicentennial Man' or even 'Pinocchio'. The few funny scenes exist only when Julie makes fun of R, like when she imitates his (their) way of walking, or when she tries to understand what name he was trying to speak. It's inevitable to mention how Teresa Palmer's acting looks like Kristen Stewart's in 2008's 'Twilight'; even the characters are really similar. Other than that, although the movie didn't have an impacting scene or anything, the photography direction-- and direction itself-- portrayed the film in a beautiful way, with melancholic scenes and a pleasant scenario. I believe that MANY people will find it utterly boring, but something about it made me feel good and in peace. 'Warm Bodies' is a great and relatively original work that became famous for being so unusual and inspiring, but is surely not a movie for all.",7,0,0,10 February 2014
The Birds," Fly Away
","Considering 'The Birds' is one of the most famous movies from Albert Hitchcock, I didn't think twice before recording it from my cable. The film's get go is very involving, mainly due to the mysterious-- and bizarre- situations characters get into. Tippi Hedren plays an audacious woman who travels to other city in order to follow a man she knew for a few minutes. For some moments, me and my dad both thought she looked a lot like Paris Hilton. The only thing to appreciate in this picture is the professional acting, which deserves some recognition. Other than that, as the birds started to attack, my dad and I had some theories about why they were doing that, or what would've happen to the citizens; we both went wrong. In fact, filmmakers never explain what is wrong with those birds, which really disappointed me. I mean, so much for nothing? I'm much aware that many Hitchcock productions have no satisfying outcome, but this one has one of the biggest let down I've recently seen! I really wanted to understand what people find so good about it, because I sincerely have no idea!",5,4,10,9 September 2014
Law Abiding Citizen," Surprisingly good
","I first thought this was gonna be just another action flick, but ended up being much better than that.The film is basically about a psycho named Clyde (which obviously remembers John Kramber, the Jigsaw) and a prosecutor who is thirsty (or appears to be) for justice. Once Clyde paints and embroiders the city authorities, the prosecutor tries to do the best he can to stop the killing spree, but just like in 'Saw', the lunatic seems to be unstoppable.It's a really good detail that the prosecutor's character is played by a black man and the mayor's played by a black woman. Hollywood used to always portray white people in the power and black people in the arrest, finally it changed at least a bit.Summarizing, this film is very entertaining, will probably give you a good time and the ending won't be that disappointing.",8,0,0,6 June 2011
The Island," Very good and entertaining
","First off it's very good since I tend to hate sci fi/action movies.'The Island' uses some ideas of films like 'Cube', 'Matrix' and 'Bicentennial Man', mixing all the concepts in a futuristic way that amazes the spectator. Even thought they extend the movie for a little too long, it's good in portraying human nature, future science, love and alienation. The action scenes are intense, not boring and Tom Lincoln's car is awesome. It gives a show of speeding car.Also this is my first movie starring Scarlett Johansson and I must say she is very hot and talented actress. Hope watching more of her movies in future.",8,4,6,8 March 2011
