The Hangover," Greatest Movie Ever
",oh my god. i have seen a lot of funny movies but this is the best. it might have parts inappropriate for younger people. and sometimes it really makes you think. but this is the best movie i've ever seen. and i've seen a lot of comedies. it has many memorable quotes. like not at the table Carlos. or when Alan hits the baby with the door and asks if his glasses are OK and Stu goes yeah you dick. you will laugh your head off. i cannot say enough how funny this movie is. i wont lie if your easily offended you might not want to watch it. but if you have a slight bit of demented humor you will find this movie to be a great choice,10,2,4,3 April 2010
