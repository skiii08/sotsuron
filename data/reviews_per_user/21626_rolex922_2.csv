The Avengers," Not great but certainly mildly entertaining...
","I certainly have an affection for the Marvel universe and some of the vast catalogue of recent films have been decent efforts. This one is certainly a decent effort but it's not the thrill ride you would expect from such a stellar line up.The plot is basically 'evil god tries to take over the world...and would have come close if it hadn't been for those meddlin' heroes...yadda, yadda' Well, you get the idea.CAST: There are some great actors in this movie who do a decent job with what they have to work with:- Iron Man, Thor & Hulk (especially) are the real backbone for me. There are some miscasts here are well:- Black Widow, Loki & the almost instantly forgettable, Hawkeye. SJ as Widow just doesn't fit for me. She's a great actress but not really an action hero. The dialogue is poor and she doesn't seem to know what attitude the character should portray. TH as Loki, he just doesn't seem to have been written a great part but there's something not mischievous enough about his portrayal. He neither hams it up or puts any sort of humour into the part.JR as Hawkeye has no screen presence or can manage any sort of chemistry with SJ when they are attempting to give some sort of validity to their respective part in this tale. It's all very wooden. That mainly comes from the limp script they're both given. Instantly forgettable.One mention should go to Samuel Jackson - dude looks as bored doing this as he did doing Star Wars! Surely he's rich and famous enough to go back to decent acting jobs, such as Long Kiss Goodnight? ;)PLOT: Too many threads makes this a long film (although it doesn't drag on). The setup seems to be mainly a precursor to getting The Hulk into the action. It's very wordy but it's not too much in-between huge bouts of action.SCRIPT: Pseudo BS (as all these movies are). There's a smattering of humour (really only from Stark) but in the main it's bearable. There are character weaknesses, like I've said above, but it ain't the script you came for and this isn't Shakespeare.ACTION/EFFECTS: My god, this looks great, even the 3D is pretty effective. There are some 'dull' action scenes (particularly the fight between Thor and Iron Man...Zzzz) but in the main, it's decently directed. One point of note though. Some of the 3D shots are so out of place it's laughable. Towards the end there's a shot through a cab rear window and it completely stops any flow the movie had for a second or two. Bizarre! There are more but that one just struck me out of the blue.SUMMARY: Not the best Marvel film and certainly not on par with other comic book films such as; X-men First Class, Nolan's Batman/Dark Knight or Raimie's initial Spiderman reboot but it's certainly better than Captain America and Green Lantern. The latter being one of the worst films I think I've ever paid to see.",5,8,27,30 April 2012
The Dark Knight," Let's define the Joker in this...
","I'll start out by saying that I am a fan of the Batman franchise and enjoy both the graphic novels and a number of the films (Schumacher..dear me!), so I do consider myself objective overall of this franchise.I gotta just say that Nolan has done a great job on both his efforts and captured the 'dark' part of the knight, with great scripts, Bale and supporting cast are superb and very true to the original intentions of the novels and ideals that Kane / Finger and many, many others have moulded the legend into over time.But - where this joker is concerned regarding Ledgers portrayal; then I feel that it is fantastically overrated. If you take the novels where Joker is the main protagonist, he has more to him than smack his lips or wipe his greasy hair back! Ledgers take on the psychotic prince of clowns is a 1 dimensional affair at best. Burton / Nicholson's depiction was closer to the overall character - the swinging pendulum between manicness and sadness (bi-polar) wrapped around the need to kill, the deep affection and true deadly respect for the Batman - sure, all touched on by Ledger but these are the core traits of the Joker, where was the outlandishness and over the top deadly playfulness? Ledger, IMHO, never had the artistic talent, depth or direction to be mean enough and psychotically twisted to do the Joker justice. He only really nodded to this murdering liars twisted past & or formative years (family etc...)superficially . The script and direction saved him overall but casting a stronger character initially was the key, never can the script or direction cover all the bases in this uniquely difficult role to cast.Overall - as callous as it may sound but the only 'positive' thing is that they will have to search for someone else for the franchise to continue. I say give Jim Carrey a crack at it...",7,0,6,17 August 2008
