3:10 to Yuma," 3:10 to where?????
","The movie started off well but end was just preposterous!!! What the hell??? Ben Wade just kills all his buddies who came all the way, taking risks to save him and when they do, he just kills 'em??!!! Why? Just because he wanted to save the boy??? And then he gets on the train to fulfill Dan Evans dream??? Ridiculous!!! And lets not mention the hearing skills of the horse who can hear Ben's gentle whistle just next to a steam engine-train!!! Russel and Chris both acted well but the story's ending was just flawed. It made no sense! Well at least to me! I know Ben Wade got impressed by Dan Evan's emotional outbursts or whatever you wanna call em but still it made no sense.If Ben Wade was such an emotional character then how can he be so insensitive towards his buddies who came to save him??? JUST PLAIN BULL!!!!!!!!!",5,5,8,22 June 2008
