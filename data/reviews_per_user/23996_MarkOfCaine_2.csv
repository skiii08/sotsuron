The Lobster," A sick, sad world.
","But I am not sure what that audience is.It is strange, robotic, and dark. This would all be good if it was also amusing, or intriguing, but unfortunately the novelty of the plot wears out really fast, characters are empty shells, attempts of black humor fail, and the occasional violence is just making you more depressed.It just isn't clicking well together.I guess there is an audience for this, but I would not recommend it.",2,4,6,11 August 2019
Gone Girl," Original idea, some plot holes.
","It is definitely an original and interesting movie. Basic idea works well, especially in the first half. Problem is it is too unrealistic, especially as the movie unravels.Acting was decent, though some of the characters were a bit off, hard to believe in.Overall, if you want a fun and original movie, this could work for you.",6,2,2,19 August 2019
