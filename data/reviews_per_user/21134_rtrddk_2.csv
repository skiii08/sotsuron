Resident Evil: Afterlife," How could you F* this up? I'm just saying.
","I love the Resident Evil movies. They are just awesome.3-D. YAY! Yeah, whatever. It was almost a dead giveaway that this movie was going to suck. There was too much focus on making this movie in 3-D that they seemed to have forgotten to put a story in it. Or, perhaps they spent their time trying to connect the movie to the game making us guess or just assume this is what happened.Like, when that huge mother f* with the hammer was breaking down the gate. I remember that guy from the game but what about those who don't play the game? Do we have to assume that its just a form of mutation or perhaps Umbrella is still doing experiments? Or how about when Alice was injected to take away the benefits of the t-virus, making her feel human again? If it worked how did she survive that plane crash? Or maybe we have to assume that she because she bonded genetically with it it's part of her DNA and couldn't just be taken or way or blocked? Or maybe it just took away her brain mojo so no more I'm gonna kill you with my mind? I gave this movie 2 stars, just for having the same people playing the same roles. I just hope that they don't use this movie as a reason not to make another one. Oh, and I just want to add that they spent entirely too much time in that prison.",2,2,6,4 December 2010
Zombieland," Still laughing
","This movie is kind of like a zombie survival guide. With rules or tips that help you survive in a world full of zombies. This movie has you laughing throughout the whole thing. Woody Harrelson was awesome and I loved his crazy obsession with Twinkies. Oh, and it's got Bill F*n Murray in it. The style and creativity was great in filming this movie like when a rule was followed by one of the characters they would slide in the title of it like the 'Double Tap' and adding in a 'Zombie Kill of the Week' gave a feeling that killing zombies was more of a game. And their choice of music was excellent. I can't think of anything they could have done better. The entire movie just seemed to flow so nicely from scene to scene and combined with their excellent choice in music it never lost your attention.",10,0,1,5 December 2010
