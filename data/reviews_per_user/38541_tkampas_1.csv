It," What did I just watch?
","Went to the movies to see that one. First time ever going to the movies for a horror movie as I am not really a fan of the genre and it is rare that I can describe a horror movie as being a good movie; scary yes, good rarely. Reading all the positive critics and reviews though I decided to give it a shot. Well, IT was at least awkward, not scary, often funny, sometimes ridiculous. As for the story, I didn't expect much (just as for the majority of horror movies) and well the story is indeed really weak. The actors played well though except that clown which was just ridiculous and not even once scary. I don't get why this movie rated that high, I certainly don't recommend it.",2,3,4,24 October 2017
