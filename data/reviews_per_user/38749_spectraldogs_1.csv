The New World," Needs subtitles
","This is NOT like 'Last of the Mohicans' even though it has one of the actors, Wes Studi. My sister and I went expecting something more story like. This is what it was probably really like for the time period. But it was confusing half the time. There was no discernible segue to a lot of the action. The characters would be speaking yet their lips did not move. It was meant to show what they were thinking but instead of showing their faces and focusing on them mentally speaking, they would jump all over the place and it got very confused. Half the time, you didn't know who was who. Sometimes Pocahontas would be wearing lots of beads and then none. All within the same frame shot.It was a C+++ movie BUT the part where she is presented at the Court of James I of England is worth the ennui of the rest of the movie.Christian Bale does not have much of a role in the movie.The movie should have used subtitles when the Indians 'Naturals' spoke in the Alongquin language.",4,1,7,30 January 2006
