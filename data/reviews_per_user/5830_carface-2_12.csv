Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A thrill ride
","I had been hearing some negative review, The film is pretty good, the special effects is magnificent, but a bit cartoon looking in some scene. The Pod Race is heart pounding, but the the Star fighter scene is weaker. The acting is also good and I don't see any problem with any cast. Jar Jar Binks is not really bad as I thought, but exaggerated a bit and the Gungans are better than Ewoks though.",8,0,0,10 May 2000
Spice World," If you wanna be sleeper
","This film is like sitting like a duck doing almost nothing. nothing significant with an exception of UFO encounter which was rather amusing. The film is not a torture, even with the Spice Girls, but the story is boring, they just chat and chat.....this is like watching Big Brother with all the cast tied up.5/10 Thankfully not cheesy or stupid, but its soo boring",Null,0,0,23 August 2000
Notting Hill," Simply charming film one of Julia Roberts' best film
","When I heard about this film, I am expecting to be boring, alas when I watched it its good beyond my expectation. The story is plain simple, but the good script, charming romance and strong and interesting supporting cast, it enriched the simple plot. The sound track and musical score is also pretty good. Compare to Pretty Woman and My Best Friend Wedding this film is better.The film may lack of Hype of Titanic or awards, but the romance is better and more unique, more solid cast, smoother acting and more interesting script.",10,1,2,12 June 2000
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Superb action
",I like this film and worth to watch several times. The action sequence are well executed. A good alternative for this film is The Matrix with similar theme and loads of actionDespite of more modern science fiction film like The Matrix or Episode I the special effects sill kicks!I give it 9 out of 10,9,1,1,23 April 2000
Independence Day," Entertaining and some satire
","Accusing this film of stereotype is totally out of note! this film focus only on American perspective duh. this film have some satire, for instance the aliens, like humans who pursuit some habitable planet for natural resource (after earth worn off) showing this type of trend can be fatal. good cast and marvelous special effects.9 out of 10",Null,0,1,9 September 2000
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Eaten by dinosaur (burp)
","I am amazed some guy thought that Lost World is better than Terminator 2 (His rage includes 'James Cameron is a HACK!!!') I found Terminator 2 more entertaining, well paced and well written despite of similar pattern of the first one). The lost world have good promises, a First rate director and big budget, but fell short of my expectation. The first movie have 'deeper' plot and 'more caring' character, but this film is a big mess. The plot failed to give me any interest and most of the scene offers nothing new. The most characters are not very interesting as the first one and most of the scene were ripped off from the first one (SUV scene anyone?). Brain less Entertainment? I found Gone in 60 seconds, Con-Air, Armageddon and Shaft are more entertaining.5.5 out of 10",Null,0,0,22 June 2001
The Hurricane," this film is great - who know who did it!
","Well if Rubin Carter is a big fat liar....well he should in big trouble! (if he actually kill them he should be ashamed), but it seems stupid that a rising boxing star is killing someone with their own car? who knows who killed them it could be a mobster from New York. I checked out the Don Lean site and its heavily biased...I don't know who actually did this murder, but I enjoy the film. Denzel is a very fine actor and delivered a great performance. The story is great and touching....hopefully most of the fact in the film is right.By the way I am not Black, Jesse Jackson Fan or Politically Correct Fan, but this film is really good.Recommended if you take Rubin Carter's issue less serious.9 out of 10",Null,0,2,22 January 2001
Titanic," Great film.
","This film got some good part and not so good, I like the film though, The love story is typical and lack of romantic wit and the script is pretty sparse, but or obviously bad, but Cameron manage to put it together (with some grunt though).
The drama is the strongest point of this film from noble band player, sacrifices of other passengers and the inevitable end of the designer of Titanic, Thomas Andrews.Special effect is awesome especially when the dolphins jumped near the massive bow of Titanic and the sinking of course. The wonderful thing is it doesn't looks like a special effects! unlike some CGI generated characters in Mars attack or Jumanji (monkeys). The music is very good and fit nicely on every scene and making the film feels like in 1912.well done for first timer James Cameron, but he needs more learning to reach same level as Steven Speilberg.
My verdict. This is not a thrill ride as Star Wars or Starship troopers or fine tune of Schindler's List, but a good movie. You like it if you don't mind Leonardo DiCaprio, sitting like a bum for 3 hours, or listening to old fashion like music. Ill give it 8 out of 10.",9,1,2,16 April 2000
Titanic," good film - victim of hyperbole and hype
","Wow as a surf through this message..there is nothing wrong if you really despise it..but calling those people who admire the film 'having a bad taste' So selfish attitude is totally unacceptable. It seem I only heard that phrase in one place...Nazi GermanyI respect those people who despised it because James Cameron is as arrogant as hell? Probably its 'politically incorrect' to have 250 million budget? Or earned 1 billion causing such petty 'jealousy'? Well who knows?I heard a site called 'People Against Titanic Hype' ...In translation..People For Star Wars Hype against Titanic hype.Titanic subject is NOT immune to hype and if a media received an information that a well-known director James Cameron will make a $150 (ended up 250 ) of Titanic epic with loaded with special effects? Hype is inevitable.
My honest thought about this film, Script isn't damnable or stupid. some 'single minded' people belived there is a stereotypes-this is BS! Of course Irish likes whiskey and they drink it dunring a celebration duh.",9,1,3,13 August 2000
The Sixth Sense," A modern classic master piece
","This is one of the best film i ever watch, the plot is so well written that is so unpredictable. Despite of some pin sized plot holes, It gives you the real twist that makes you watch over and over again. Bruce Willis and Osment acting is so good it feels like you are part of the film. Unlike 'The Haunting' This film doesn't rely much on special effect to make it scary. Must see!Rating 10 out of 10",10,0,0,23 July 2000
Tarzan," Goofier than I expected...
","I am expecting some kind of 'epic' in this film, but when I watched it, Its more like a comedy, but very engaging and very well done. The animation is brilliant with a few exception on some water animation (shared same problem with Prince of Egypt) is too smooth for this type of animation and kind of 'surreal' feelings. Unfortunately this film is not really the Disney 'Family Friendly' formula compare to Aladdin, Little Mermaid or even The Lion King.overall, is very good. the film is fun to watch, Charming characters, superb animation and good sound track.a respectable 8 out of 10",Null,0,0,12 June 2000
High Fidelity," Number 1 on top five comedies!
","This film is one of most ignored film by audience. But despite of that, the film is witty, entertaining and original. The cast (lead by John Cusack) delivered a great performance along with the the supporting cast (Todd Louiso and Jack Black). The film is very funny, It makes you giggle for minutes. Unlike some love movies, this film doesn't rely too much on cliches and formulas. Rock fans will not disappointed with killer sound track! Definitely must not missed. 10 out of 10",Null,0,1,22 January 2001
