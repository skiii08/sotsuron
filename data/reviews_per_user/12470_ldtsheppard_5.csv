Hereditary," Truly awful
","Unrelentingly dark and uncomfortable, very well filmed and acted but, ultimately, unwatchable.Full of plot holes large enough to drive a bus through and non-sensical interactions between the family members ruin what could have been a decent film.Don't bother. This is terrible.",1,5,7,24 January 2020
The Irishman," Mind-numbing
","Hands-down one of the most boring films ever made. An amazing achievement given the quality of the actors.Unless you enjoy watching the intricacies of union politics, don't bother watching it.",2,165,324,28 November 2019
Prisoners," Unnecessarily long and drawn out
","I have never seen as many people walk out of a cinema as I did when I went to watch this - I would guess that a minimum of a third of the audience left!! It is ridiculously slow and about an hour too long. The drama is not drawn out at all and you just end up wishing that they'd get on with the storyline. Attempts to draw out the tension are basic and laughable, while the excellent cast are forced to use tortured facial expressions to give the film any semblance of feeling.Overall an incredibly disappointing experience. I was expecting to love this, I ended up wanting to follow everyone else out of the cinema. Ridiculously poor, given the promising subject and excellent cast.",4,5,10,12 February 2015
The Shawshank Redemption," Massively overrated
","Yeah, so it's a nice story (eventually) but it takes a long time getting there. Unbearably depressing for most of the movie.",4,0,1,21 January 2019
The Purge," Great idea, TERRIBLE execution
","I am a MASSIVE horror film fan and when I heard about the premise for this film, I will admit, I was pretty excited. In my head, I was expecting a city, or country, full of fear, crime, anarchy and general debauchery. What we got, instead, was Panic Room 2!!! I mean seriously... You have the potential to create a horror film of epic proportions and you turn it into a home invasion film, with weak dialogue, poor acting and the kind of ridiculous horror film clich√©s that Scream was parodying years ago!! I was actually embarrassed. Why would you set a plot that limits you so severely? I spent the entire film wondering why no one took the writers to one side and explained a few basic facts on how to cook up a film that actually scares people.Incredibly poor and a completely wasted opportunity.",2,1,1,12 February 2015
