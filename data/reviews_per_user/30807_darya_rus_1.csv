Catch Me If You Can," Catch Me If You Can
","At first glance, I can say that the film 'Catch Me If You Can' by Steven Spielberg is a classic film that does not claim for high awards and a dominant place in the history of cinematograph. But after the first, second and third viewing it becomes clear that the creators, without even waiting for it, created a truly exciting and unique movie. This is not an entertaining film for the general public, this is a film-story for a thoughtful and curious viewer.
The film 'Catch Me If You Can' is not intended to tell the viewer any thoughtful story with a global human problem. We see the story of a schoolboy, a minor American teenager, who at such a young age managed to be a representative of a wide variety of professions: an airline pilot, a qualified doctor, a lawyer. In his spare time, he fell in love with forging bank checks, thanks to which he managed to save up impressive multimillion-dollar capital. But the FBI agents get involved in the chase of a young swindler. The plot of the film is a powerful and intriguing embodiment of a true story by means of cinematograph. The main goal of the film was to tell in a dynamic form the most interesting situations that took place in the investigation of the case of Frank Abagnale.
Steven Spielberg has proved himself as a powerful and professional film director. In my opinion, he is the very film director who can combine together absolutely contradictory genres. The whole atmosphere is focused on the chase, on the feelings of the persecuted and the pursuer. A lot of funny and humorous moments, embellishing in all a dramatic picture, allow viewers to relax while watching. Steven Spielberg created a light comedy - dramatic film and while watching it you fully immersed in the developing events and directly take part in them.
The actor's game contributed its positive mite to the overall concept of the film, without which, probably, it would not have had half of its success. First of all, I should say that Leonardo DiCaprio, for his then-young age, coped well with his role. He looks like an inquisitive young man who wears various masks. For him, the occupation of a scam is a hobby that absorbed him completely. Through the actor's talent, this image looks convincing and memorable. I would like to mention the wonderful work of Amy Adams, who, although she appeared in a cameo role, however, was able to attract the attention of the audience. The actress completely reincarnated, and this role became not similar to the rest of her ones in her career. Tom Hanks does not look like a boy against the background of the young actors I have mentioned. His character looks funny and energetic against the background of realistic fret and other emotions accompanying this feeling.
In conclusion, I want to say that 'Catch Me If You Can' is an exciting and dynamic film about financial scams that don't get bored during the rather long timeline and leave a wonderful mood with their bright and positive atmosphere.",8,0,2,19 February 2019
