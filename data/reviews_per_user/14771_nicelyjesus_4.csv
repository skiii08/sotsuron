It," Oh the horror, oh the heart....
","One of the best movie experiences I had in 2017. Casting was near perfect, especially with the kids and Bill. Not as scary as many were expecting but it's okay, you're still engaged. Excited for part two.",10,0,1,23 February 2018
Black Panther," Loved it!
","One of the biggest Jewels in the Marvel crown since Guardians of the Galaxy for different reasons. Speaks volumes on race, but looking beyond gender set roles etc. One of the best villains since Loki. I had a blast, beautifully presented with characters that are easy to invest and believe in. Great work.",10,2,8,23 February 2018
The Greatest Showman," From now on, I probably won't listen to critics....
","Yes, this is a very loosely based adaptation on the live and performance ministry of P.T Barnum, but still it deserves a chance. It's one of the few films of 2017 that I left with a uplifting spirit in celebrating humanity. The music serves up some iconic hits, that shake the room. Hugh Jackman calls this his passion project, and its obvious why.",9,1,3,23 February 2018
Annihilation," Biological Bliss
","I'll admit there were moments in the film, where I turned to my buddy I was with and said 'what the heck is happening?' eventually the answers all panned out. Casting, and the overall presentation was fascinating. Themes were interesting some obvious, while other hidden or subjective. It's a movie I recommend everyone to see, even though its probably not one to put on repeat reviewing. Not as scary as the PR seems to put on, but still I very though-provoking and entertaining ride.",8,2,13,23 February 2018
