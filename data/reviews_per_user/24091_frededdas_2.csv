The Finest Hours," the brain dead will NOT like this,but true movie people will
","sorry but if your expecting lots of explosions and fighting or massive cgi effects leave now this is a good quality directed and acted film well worth a watch if in 3d better still? the acting is OK,not award stuff but the award stuff seen this year was all rubbish! story real and at the end shows the people involved and as such made it even better. there are to many so called cinema/movies that depend on special effects and not interested in the mind,hence my brain dead quote at the start I like a brain dead film also...but honestly how many avengers/iron mans/etc do we have to suffer with? there is lots of cgi involved in this film.but all used to good impressive effect. last word ,go see this and you will enjoy as its a real piece of cinema entertainment@@@@@@@@@@@@",8,2,7,8 April 2016
Doctor Strange," the sheep are let out again, the rates for this are made by sheep1
","story a little of it thats a change, the so called effects.'mindblowing'siacdelic' and new' are all old tired and when will people who pay to see this realise they are being ripped of by the same rubbish rehashed for every film? the acting was OK the story OK, the effects OK. the film a great let down after reading the reviews on here people must have seen a different film to me in the uk?????? go see it and judge it. but to say its the best,,never, iam not a great lover of the recent ones in last 5 years, but lets have a good film with effects that are NOT noticeable . then you have great effects.ben cummy does OK with the role, but otherwise a let down, and my judgement of these reviews is 2 fold, they are made buy people who are under 10 years old. never grown up, or made by people who are paid by the makers????",3,2,5,2 November 2016
