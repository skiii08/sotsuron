The Blair Witch Project," William Castle meets Cannibal Holocaust
","Don't believe the hyperbole: this is a resourceful, effective and bold scare movie, but it is far from original.  The narrative conceit of this film is lifted whole-hog from Ruggero Deodato's notorious Cannibal Holocaust (1979). Astute cinema aficionados will recall that film's similar but entirely more convincing and properly established recovered-documentary-footage-of-film-crew-lost-in-the-wild motif.  The promotional campaign tactics (which are, of course, contributing much to the film's effect) are a subtle reworking of the scare-em-before-they're-even-inside-the-theater technique immortalized by the great William (13 Ghosts, Homicidal, The Tingler, et al) Castle.TBWP is intermittently nerve-racking, unpredictable, and surprising, but is badly marred by unjudicious pacing, an unsustained mood and some nagging technical oversights (read: slick sound mixing, over-precise editing) that will likely un-suspend the knowing viewer's suspension of disbelief.That being said, it's nice to see ultra-low-budget scare movies back in the theaters where they belong.",Null,0,2,23 June 1999
Armageddon," A complete misinterpretation
","I originally thought this movie was a sly, cynical, masterfully-made, audience-hating parody of action/disaster film cliches.  The plot, of course!, was stretched beyond all plausibility.  The situations, of course!, were preposterous.  The science, of course!, was ridiculous.  The characters, of course!, were cardboard cutouts sliding from dumb predicament to dumb predicament.  Then, listening to the commentary track on the Criterion (!) DVD, the filmmakers revealed that they were absolutely seriously trying to make a straightforward mainstream action flick for teenage boys.  People apparently cried at that mawkish stuff that seemed so knowingly planted to trigger obvious emotional tugs.   This movie is simply entertaining crap, and the impulses of the Hollywood sludge factory are far worse than previously suspected.  The gag reel and supplementary material on the Criterion DVD has more personality than the whole movie.",Null,0,1,14 June 1999
The Sixth Sense," Gaudy, sentimental, hokey, self-satisfied and predictable pablum
","This ridiculous, contrived, and artless bore of a movie, in one of its countless aesthetic miscalculations, mistakes a stately pace for depth and profundity.  It rises above the typical summer film pap for a single reason -- it thinks it has Ideas about Big Issues.  It automatically plunges back to a suitable level, however, as it demonstrates this broad lack of ideas at an interminable pace.The makers of this shallow dreck seem to think they have made a thinking person's summer popcorn movie about Death, and The American Family, and Love, and The Breakdown Of The American Family, and The Loss Of Love.  But really, it's just another jumble of the same old crap: cardboard characters in prefab situations, behaving as they do because the plot needs them to, not for any intrinsic reason, and not -- resolutely not -- with any underlying impulse or motivation.Aside from its laughably sophomoric spiritual pose, The Sixth Sense is also shoddily constructed.  Most of the scenes are either fake and stagey, redundant, irrelevant, obvious, or all of the above, and they are edited together with the sloppiest imprecision.  There is no sense of drama, mystery or anything else.Although some of the imagery is imaginative and the production design is superb, they are placed in the service of an inert, smug and witless vision, presumably that of its writer/director.  This unintentionally comic garbage makes 'Jacob's Ladder' look like Bergman.The Sixth Sense is strictly for amateurs.",Null,0,0,25 August 1999
The Matrix," Hackneyed Pseudo-Philosophy For Dummies
","This is the perfect film for the dimmer bulbs in the comic book geek population.  The laughable 'profundities' -- unaccountably uttered with deep foreboding and a straight face -- sound like a bad mix of Yoda, Rod McKuen and your average neighborhood stoner.  And how are we to not laugh outright at the sight of a toddler yogi bending spoons with the power of his mind? The 'what-is-reality?' theme is as old as the dream state itself, and The Matrix offers no real contribution to the debate.  The imagery, while lovely and inventive, and the direction, although deft and punchy, mask (all too effectively for some) the lack of a true, unique vision from the filmmakers, who demonstrated so much more on a much smaller scale in Bound.  However, if your sense of film history only extends back to Dark City and your philosophical preoccupations were ignited by The Sandman, this whole muddled film is all gonna seem mighty big and new.  But, hey, at least it's entertaining.",Null,0,0,14 June 1999
