The Rock," Truly an Action Masterpiece!
","What more can you honestly say about Jerry Bruckheimer and his team of loyal film experts, they're amazing! This is definitely one of my all time favorite films, a non-stop action packed blockbuster which leaves most of it's kind far behind. There is just something about the way that Bruckheimer makes his movies, whether it be his passion or skill; all of his accomplishments speak for themselves. Top Gun started the ball rolling in 1986, and since then we've seen nothing but fantastic movies come out of his studios, We've seen the birth of Beverly Hills Cop, then Days Of Thunder, Bad Boys, Con Air, Armageddon etc. etc. all of which stand out as some of the best action and adventure flicks ever made.... 'The Rock' not only takes you on a Rollercoaster ride of one-liners and expensive stunts that Bruckheimer is renowned for, it co-stars Sean Connery (James' Law, any movie with Sean Connery is worth seeing) and Nicolas Cage, two of the worlds best actors by far who light up the screen in their duo! Bruckheimer also successfully sneaks in an underlying plot with Sean Connery's character 'James Mason' derived from his early James Bond roles, which I'm sure any Bond fan will love.If you're going to hire any movie this weekend, let it be The Rock, even if you have seen it 10 times before, one not to be missed. A definite 9 and a half out 10",Null,1,1,7 June 2001
