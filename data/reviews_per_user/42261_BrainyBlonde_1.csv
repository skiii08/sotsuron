The Blair Witch Project," I thought it was real......
",I'd fortunately gotten an advanced copy of this film from a friend who worked for a studio. He was smart enough to tell me that the whole thing was real and that these were actual tapes they found of these lost kids. I saw that sci fi show that looked like a documentary and really thought I was watching actual footage. I was scared to death. I think if I'd known the real story it wouldn't have had the same effect. But it sure was effective when you think what you're seeing isn't acting and is real. I loved it. Brilliant original scary and GOOD!,10,1,3,1 November 2002
