Scarface," A real classic staring a real actor
","Without a question, the greatest film i have ever watched in my whole life. Al Pacinio is the greatest actor in Hollywood to date.Pacino plays Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee who slowly climbs the ladder to become Maimi's top drug king. Montana won't let anybody get in his way, all he has in this world are his balls and his word and he won't break them for no one. Along with his pal, Manny (Steven Bauer), they are about to take this town by the balls.Without Al Pacino, there would be no film. Nobody could have played Tony Montana like Al Pacino.The film can be quiet violent in places and a little uneasy (Watch the Chainsaw bit and you'll see what i mean) but it's Pacino who lights up the screen. Everything he does and says is brilliant. Watch this film because of Al Pacino. Through the whole film you begin to wonder, is he good or bad (There's one scene with two kids in a car that will make you think about that question).Go out and rent SCARFACE from your local video shop and watch it. You won't be disappointed. And if you are disappointed and hate this film -jump of a bridge a die a really horrible death. 10/10.",10,0,2,14 July 2007
Reservoir Dogs," Bloody Brilliant
","Despite what critics think, this is a Tarantino masterpiece with unforgettable characters, smooth and cool dialogue, and a shocking finale.Since this is a crime flick, the plot and storyline isn't that complex or deep, and there is no reason for it to be. It's pretty simple. Perfect strangers plan the perfect crime, but end up in a bloody set-up. With only four of them left alive, they must uncover the rat in the house. But which one is it? That is something they must find out before the cops get a hold of them in this unforgiving and spectacular crime/noir movie.The writing is off the hook. Tarantino is a master when it comes to dialogue. Why? Because the characters talk like real people. In ordinary movies, all the characters ever talk about it the plot or scheme. In THIS movie, they talk about everyday normal things that we would talk about, which makes them seem more realistic and convincing. His writing reminds me a lot of Raymond Carver, except with more humour.The cast is terrific. Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Lawrence Tierney, and Steve Buscemi all did their roles justice. Michael Madsen is awesome and cool as Mr. Blonde, who will always be remembered for that very particular role. Buscemi is hilarious, and your eyes never leave his sight when he's on screen. But really, everyone is outstanding in this movie. 10/10 Outstanding.",10,0,2,2 November 2007
Pulp Fiction," Very Good but ...
","I didn't get what all the fuss was about really. Well it wasn't a bad film it was a very good film, the acting for one thing was brilliant, especially by Samuel L. Jackson, the Diolauge was at its best for another thing, but the only problem was that it was really slow in parts like the JACKS RABBIT SLIM or whatever you call it. Before John Travolta and Uma Thurman start dancing their talking about foot massages and some other things while doing nothing but sitting down in a 50's restaurant. Now like i said, the Diolauge is very good and its really funny but while their doing nothing the film can get boring. Another thing like that was the ending, the big Mexican duel in the restaurant. Sam Jackson has a gun to Tim Roth's head, Amanda Plummer is pointing a gun to Jackson and John Travolta is pointing a gun to Amanda. All that is happening for about ten, fifteen minutes and nothing proper happens. Sam Jackson is telling Roth about a miracle he witnessed this morning, and then he gives Roth his money and then he lets him go, and its like oh come on get on with it all ready. As for the really good parts there was the hamburger scene, OK now that was slow but not boring like some of the others, there was the dance scene, the overdose scene was the only part in the film where i was on the edge of my seat, then their was the pawn shop scene which was really funny and shocking. And finally there was the 'The Bonnie Situation' which was boring and good.Not long after i watched the film, my friend asked me to borrow it and i said OK. A day later he gave it back and said it was crap. I can see why people could hate this film, apart from the racial stuff, and i can see why people love this film but as for me, i give it a 7 out 10 for being and not being good. I recommend Reservoir Dogs instead. 7/10 OK.",6,0,1,19 October 2007
Raging Bull," Raging Bullshit Indeed
","First Mean Streets then Taxi Driver then this. Martin Scorsese is defiantly the most overrated director in history and De Niro is just a terrible actor. The Academy awards must have been high on something that year to give De Niro an Oscar for gaining weight. He was supposed to win an Oscar for best 'acting' not for best weight gainer of the year. People who don't see that must need some help. I agree with STAN39520. It should be burned (along with Taxi Driver), and if anybody else directed this or stared in it they would pay no attention to it. So what makes Martin Scorsese great, huh! To me, the only great films hes ever done are 'Cape Fear', 'The Aviator', 'Casino' and the 'The Departed'. I really felt like i was doing a sinful thing watching this piece of crap! One of the greatest films of all time they say, one of the 'worst' films of all time. A boxing film with hardly no boxing in it. I think the only reason why Scorsese made this film is because of Taxi Driver losing to Rocky at 77 academy awards. I bet he said i can do a better boxing film than Rocky. Sorry Marty, Rocky won best picture, this and Taxi Driver didn't. 0/10 Awful",1,9,49,17 August 2007
The Deer Hunter," Boring!
","Wow. After hearing all the praise this movie has gotten , I figured this would definitely be a good watch. After just a half hour of the movie, I became so bored I really wanted to turn it off. I didn't however, and kept the movie running. During the next 2 1/2 hours I was baffled at what people saw in this snooze-fest. It's a horrible movie. Beyond horrible! This couldn't keep you interested no matter what happened. It just drags and drags and drags. A couple war scenes are slightly entertaining, but besides that it totally sucks. In closing, do not judge a book by it's cover. Just because De Niro is in this do not think it will be good. This is probably one of the most overrated and boring movie I've ever seen. Steer clear of this unless you like wasting your time. 0/10 Boring!",1,18,32,2 February 2008
