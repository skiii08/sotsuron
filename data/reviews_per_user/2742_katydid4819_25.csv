Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Good Acting, Good Film making
","I don't know whether or not I liked this film. While watching, I enjoyed it and was interested to find out what happened next. Yet, after leaving the theater, I was left feeling that maybe there should have been something more. Or maybe something less.Uma Thurman's performance is something I can say that I liked both while watching and afterward. She has more character development in this film than in the first and she wastes no time sinking her teeth deep into the part. She is one tough chick and at the same time she is still human, which is something the film needs. She grounds the movie while everything else spins along side. Maybe the best word for my reaction is that this movie felt creepy. Tarantino's obsession with Thurman is made very obvious, especially in the last chapter. She responds with the reaction of a young girl when her father tells her how pretty she is; one of those comments that you know means something else. I say this is some of Uma's best acting right here in this scene.Without all the gore of the first film, this one does some background exploring of the characters and it makes a very good follow up to the first. Despite my weird feelings, this film is still one that I recommend. ***/****",9,0,1,25 April 2004
Miracle," No Miracles Happened Here
","There are too many good stories to bring to the big screen. Therefore, a hierarchy exists in the script room. Films with the underdog coming from behind to overcome enormous odds just aren't enough anymore. Miracle made the jump to production not because it's about this but because of its sub story about the effect the underdog's victory had. 'Do you believe in miracles?'The story is about one coach trying to bring the USA Olympic team to glory against the unbeatable Soviets. His team is comprised of twenty-some athletes fresh from either Boston of Minnesota, hence a rivalry. Their average age is twenty-one while their opponets have been playing together for ten years. Of course we all know what happens because, like all other sports stories, this one comes with the tagline 'Based on a True Story'. But that, albeit important, is not really what matters. The main focus is here is how they do it. The team has a drill. They skate from the red line to the blue line back to the red. Simple, right? After tying a game, the coach (Kurt Russell) brings his team back out onto the ice as the audience is leaving and makes them run this drill again and again and again and again and again and againÂ… It's the most well done scene in the whole movie. It has you sympathizing with all the people on the screen. You understand Russell's anger and need to win but still can't believe he'd make them skate the drill again. Again and again. In the pit of your stomach you feel as if you may vomit yourself. The scene is set in partial darkness and scored subtly. Too much time is spent trying to develop a side story about Russell's past career as an Olympian and how he feels he was robbed of a medal. This causes him to throw himself into his work and neglect his family. There are two or three arguments he has with his wife that start one way and then morph into wannabe 'money scenes' that might as well have tears streaming from the wife's eyes and a drunk, angered Russell. Instead, they try to get that same feeling across with their dialogue but that falters. However, everything comes across as silly and contrived.Miracle is a Disney movie and it shows. It is clean family fun that is also uplifting and, from a distance, a good time. It gets across all the major points of the 'based on a true story' genre, including the side story built around the coach. The players are inter-changeable and yet you feel as if you know them. The movie gets you cheering and that was probably all it ever aspired to do. ***/*****",6,1,6,6 November 2004
Friday Night Lights," 'Friday' Will Light Up Your Night
","There are many types of formula movies. A romantic comedy, a slasher, a thriller, the list just goes on. Sports movies tend to be formulaic too. Usually, it's the underdogs that rise to greatness through their coach. It also helps if the story is based on actual events. You see this played out in both directions. The bad is embodied in The Rookie, which sub came to the expectations of Disney. The other end of the spectrum is Friday Night Lights, which really is a formula but has the heart that The Rookies needed. Friday Night Lights will hopefully take its place next to films like Hoosiers as one of the greats about sports.Billy Bob Thorton is the football coach in Odessa, Texas. The town lives and breathes football and they want nothing more than for their team to take state. The players are average teenage boys. They want to win for the glory it will bring their school/town but also to get scholarships out of Odessa, which we see through the opening credits, is not a place anyone would want to settle in for life. Thorton usually plays roles where he appears magnified. He is usually the stand out because of the nature of his character. Here, he plays the opposite of that. He is the most human of all the people in the film. He is grounded and realizes that 'the only difference between winning and losing is how people treat you.' His performance is subtle and, although not as showy as, say, Bad Santa, is just as good.For a fan of football, the movie does not disappoint. The plays are excellent and anyone who has ever watched their very capable team fumble time and time again will feel those same feelings when watching this. At the same time, it does not lack the glory of the kick-off return run for a touchdown or the fifty-yard run by the player that isn't even a running back. It is the perfect mix of reality and hope.While Friday Night Lights specializes in football, it does try and add character development. It's nice but, at times, falters and you have to remember, this is not part of the formula that it subscribes to. In these scenes, the cinematography tries for the stylized chaos look but comes off more as chaos than something art made. I don't think that the level of film-making should decrease with the genre and so that makes the errors in Friday Night Lights inexcusable but still they have to be looked at as attempts to widen the boundaries of this type of storytelling and that is commendable. Most sports films like to have character growth and often accomplish about the same amount as 'Lights' but what is different here is how it is made a main priority to try and get across some motives at the same times show incredible, miraculous touchdowns.I won't spoil the ending but will simply say that it is 'perfect'. It is perfect the way Billy Bob Thorton tells his players to be. He gives a perfect speech to his perfect players in a perfect film.***1/2 out of *****",7,0,1,24 October 2004
The Notebook," A True Love Story From Beginning To End
","You don't find many movies like The Notebook. Sure, there are many loves stories, too many, actually. They all follow the same formula and you know the ending from the time the lights go down. The Notebook is also a love story; it's a formulaic movie that you already know the end of. What makes it different is that it's the story of one couples relationship from start to finish. 	Allie (Rachel McAdams) and Noah (Ryan Gosling) meet at a carnival the summer that Allie is seventeen. She's high society spending the summer in Seabrook. He doesn't have a dime to his name. It's the classic tale of love, the rich girl and the boy her parents don't approve of. Despite, they fall in love. Fast-forward twenty years, Allie's about to marry to a man of money. But that wouldn't be fitting in this story of true love, would it?	The movie is based off the novel by Nicholas Sparks (A Walk To Remember, Message In A Bottle). Like his previous two book-into-movie adaptations, the focus is on the story and not the characters. These stories do not specialize in developing well-rounded characters. To enjoy The Notebook, you have to suspend reality in this aspect. Noah appears to the audience as the perfect boy, who's just too nice, too sweet. His character is always staring at Allie with sad, puppy dog eyes, even after twenty-five years. But, if you accept that this is the character, Ryan Gosling's performance is good. It's strong and believable. Rachel McAdams who's previous film this year was Mean Girls, takes a complete turn form that and gives the best performance of the movie. This may be because her character is the written better than anyone else's. 	The true achievement of The Notebook is in the portrayal of first love, the summer romance. McAdams and Gosling have a great chemistry that is not just a physical attraction but, even in their quarrels, they still radiate a deep friendship that helps underline the point of The Notebook. Fortunately, the portion of the movie with McAdams and Gosling is more than the part with the older versions of themselves (James Garner and Joan Allen). Garner is reading from the notebook to Allen. She is stricken with Alzheimers and he's convinced that if he reads the story to her enough, his Allie will remember. It's touching and sweet but not as accurately done as the former. From mistakes in the medical aspects of it, to the leap of faith the last scene makes, it comes up more scattered than the rest. 	It's not an amazing movie but from the material it's based on, it could have been much worse. The excellent performances by the whole cast and the heart that is shown make it a decent film. It's not one that will stand the test of time as an amazing love story but it's worth seeing. Though it's a tearjerker, it's also hopeful in the best way.",7,1,1,4 July 2004
Spider-Man 2," Web Crawler Hits Absolute High
","Spiderman 2 ****1/2/*****Spiderman 2 is the perfect sequel. It combines the character from the first one with improved special f/x and a more natural script. Spiderman 2 is also an action/superhero movie that appeals to more than just the teenage boy. The bulk of the film is not pounding rock beats and images of extreme stunts done mostly by the f/x geeks on their computers. Instead, there is human weakness in this movie. There is pain (yes, the emotional kind) allowing for compassion to be felt for Peter Parker, making it easier for the audience to root for him. 	 The story picks up where it left off. For those who missed out on the first one (that's right, we judge you for it) will be brought up to speed by a cleaver set of comic book style animations shown with the opening credits. Even if you were one of the millions of people that saw the original, the pictures are a good reminder and help jog you memory of those key plot events. Knowledge of Spidey's first film is essential because this second story is not a new adventure all together, as most sequels tend to do, but instead it continues to dig into the effect earlier events have on Peter Parker. Peter (Tobey Maguire) appears to be a failure. Perhaps this is why we love him. We see that he is no different than us and that appeals to our perhaps subconscious desire to be superhuman in one way or another. He's a failing school, his career and his love life. Who can't relate to at least one of those? Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), on the other hand, is doing fabulous. Her acting career has picked up and she's becoming that star we all also want to be. She's going to get married to an astronaut and it appears to be the Â‘it' life. But there's still Peter who she wants to be with but Peter just can't seem to make it happen. He keeps letting her down. In turn, Peter is heart broken about hurting MJ again and again and so he decides to start a new life.This is the story about Peter without Spiderman. Of course that doesn't last as a new villain appears on the scene. Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) is a man but he just happens to have four extra mechanical arms. The arms have a life of their own, thus making them superior to Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin that we saw in the first film. One of the important aspects about this genre of movie is that if you're going to make sequel, you must replace the villain. We've already seen how the first one was beat; we crave fresh blood. That, in a nutshell, it the action genre moviegoers attitude.
Well, Doc Ock deliver and actually has the audience gasping here and there. Just like Peter, Ock is human too. He's simply exercising another desire, to be rich and powerful. He is the epitome of `How far would you go?'In a summer full of sequels, Harry Potter and the box office cash cow Shrek 2, Spiderman 2 is nothing short of its predecessors. In fact, it's much better.  More than living up to the first one, Spidey is good time had. ****1/2 out of *****",10,0,0,12 July 2004
Troy," Troy Raises The Bar to Epic Levels
","Troy has gotten a lot of grief from critics. They say that it does not do Homer justice. But how can anything? And besides, the average movie goer has probably not even read Homer (myself included). There may have been that World History class you took way back when but that probably slipped most people's minds, too. Remember when the Lord of the Rings fans threw a fit because they said no one could adapt the books properly? Well, they shut up pretty fast. Now, this is no Lord of the Rings, but it is not a CGI fest that disappoints.For the first half of Troy, there is more nudity than blood. The epic battles and all their blood shed do eventually show up but the nudity never really fades into the background. Actually, the nudity is more authentic than the blood. You would think a movie about 'the greatest war there ever was' would invest in more than watered down food coloring. Especially because they do more than a couple close up shots of their battered soldiers.The acting is much better than expected. All the actors do a good job with the genre they are a part of. Peter O'Tool is the scene stealer. He gives an excellent performance that should be remembered come Oscar season. Eric Bana quickly sheds The Hulk (thank god) and gives possibly the best performance of his career. Orlando Bloom shows that he is growing up with his roles. He does not play the strong, emotionally put together hero, but the pretty boy who struggles with the knowledge that he is just that and nothing more. Another best of their career performance. Brad Pitt is good to look at but falls in the shadows of his fellow cast mates. This is not all his fault though. He is given the most physical of all the roles and he does this well. Though he does have a character arc, it is not as visible as Bloom's. Sean Bean, another LOTR veteran, takes on the role of Odysseus. He does the part solidly and is not at all Bormoir.If this is a preview of what the summer is to be then I can't wait. Troy has raised the bar above the crap that studios got away with last summer. It is worth the time and the money. ***/****",8,0,1,15 May 2004
The Polar Express," New Animation Technology Overshadows Story
","How do you adapt a 15 page children's book into a two-hour movie? You are going to have to stretch some parts and take liberties at others. The problem with adapting such a beloved book is that some people may have problems with liberties such as adding characters and dance sequences. With The Polar Express, Robert Zemecks and Tom Hanks, a dream team of sorts, do just this. Maybe their intention had nothing to do with bringing this magical book to life but was more about breaking boundaries with new animation. Because of this, they found it easier to add what they liked here and there because, after all, it's not hard to add anything from a shadow to a person with the new technology they employed for the film.The book tells the tale of a boy who has lost his Christmas spirit. On Christmas Eve, he boards the Polar Express when it pulls in front of his house. The train takes its passengers (all children) to the North Pole for the first gift of Christmas to be given by Santa to a lucky one of them. The film stays true to each of these aspects, but if it were to have only this, the film would be over in thirty minutes. So, a couple of side characters are invented. There is young black girl, a know-it-all boy, a boy who won't sit with the others, and hobo who is as mysterious as the Christmas spirit. Some of their adventures are cute and add to the story. There is a wonderful scene where the main character climbs on top of the train and meets the hobo. Of course, there are other parts that could have been revised. When the train skids across ice, the two main characters have to stop the train and even though the girl has been told which is the brake, they second guess things for a while culminating in a cringe-worthy gesture by the little girl; she quickly gives up and buries her face in her hands.The animation has been what's driven the buzz for The Polar Express. It's the latest form of motion capture, first used for Gullom in The Lord Of The Rings. The performance by Tom Hanks as the conductor (or one of his other six roles) is done by Hanks himself and then, using CGI, is animated and blended with the completely computer generated background. It is because of this that Hanks is capable of playing more than one character. There are many moments where he is the only actor in the scene although there are many characters. Some of his performances are recognizably him, such as the conductor or the hobo to a lesser extent. Others show the magic behind Hanks and the technology. He plays the main character without a trace of himself.There are down sides to the animation too. The people have an unnatural air about them. Perhaps it's the eyes, which are the only part of a performance that cannot be captured by the motion capture system. The eye is often the entirety of a performance in some scenes and is also often said to be a window to the soul. Without 'souls' the characters are lifeless. Although the images from the movie are able to sometimes almost able to mirror those from the book, the effect it has on the people is still problematic. ***/*****",6,1,4,28 December 2004
Closer," Closer doesn't go far
","What kind of move ignores its subject matter? Closer is a movie about sex or love. Your pick. However, neither makes an appearance. Mike Nicohls gives us a movie with lust and striping (implied, at that) but leaves out the juicy details. If people are accusing Kinsey of keeping its hands clean, they haven't see Closer yet.Based on the stage play of the same name, this is a movie about four people that play musical bed partners for two hours. It doesn't have to end there. There is no reason for us to go home to a real idea of the world other than that people get impatient if something takes longer than they were expecting. That's a great way to explain Alexander's failure without having to bring up the topic of homosexuality. In the case of Closer, the film could have ended after the first half hour, the second half hour and so on. There is a break between each set of screaming matches between yet another different pairing of the only four people in the movie. This is a convenient time to get a refill on your caffeine. What my dad refers to as 'focusing agent' should make a tidy sum with this film. They should market together. I mean, how else to you plan to stay focused (for lack of a better word) during this event? With such a popular subject, such as love, it is important to be original and to offer something that the guy next door couldn't. A movie should offer something more than depiction of life. Closer presents a very bleak look at love and to accompany that should be a reason. What did these characters do that brought them to this? Why do they settle for it? Each of the four characters is practically that same as their counter part. Of course, there are small differences. Anna is a successful photographer and Alice is a stripper but these things are not big enough to build a character study on and that, at times, is what Closer aims for. In its dissection of this view on love, the characters should be the catalysts but instead serve more as puppets to deliver the witty line that does not add to the over all picture.If we wanted solely a portrait of life, we would watch a documentary. A film is a medium of art that will be bombarded by critics and pretentious moviegoers (myself included) trying to find symbolism. The sad truth here is that the symbols we seek are often not there and what is happens to be nothing more than a chuckling director who knows he has the audience on a string. Still, even when the symbolism is far fetched, there needs to be something to differentiate a movie from a home video. Just because a moment is caught on film does not make it art. Closer is obviously art, no disputing. The problem is that no one bothered to make it interesting art. If I want to watch a movie about love or a movie about sex my choices are endless. Why should I pick this one? Because Natalie Portman is finally a 'grown up'? Because Clive Own is the next big thing? Because Julia Robets ditched the Pretty Woman and $20 million pay check for this? Maybe another day. ***/*****",6,0,0,28 December 2004
Lost in Translation," Life, Actually
","This is an excellent movie about how real people act everyday. Whether or not this is an actual autobiography of it's writer/director Sophia Coppola, it is something everyone can relate to. Set in Tokyo, it's the story of Charolett, a young woman who is newly married and on her honeymoon. Alone for most of each day in a big hotel, she finds herself constantly running into Bob. He is the other side of her story. He leads a completely different life than her but they bond over the fact that, though they are different, they both feel lonely in the same way.The acting is the spectacular part of this film. Actually, it's Scarlett Johansson who deserves most of the credit. Bill Murray is his same character, and though he plays it very well, he has in truth, a lot longer to work out the kinks. Johansson plays Charolett with a subtle manner that more than holds its own against Murray. The screenplay is good. Not great, but good. In my honest opinion, the Coppola is what won this movie its one and only Academy Award (Original Screenplay). It's neither clever nor is it funny in an outright manner. But this movie is a dipiction of life and life is not usually any of the above. Still, the poetic dialogue only survives because of the skills of those delivering it. This should be seen because it's very real and is easy to relate to. ***/****",7,0,1,23 April 2004
The Aviator," The Aviator Flys High
","To make a film documenting the life of Howard Hughs is an ambitious task. Luckily Matin Scorsese is an ambitious man. However, there are dangers to having a big-name director. As is sometimes the case, they feel that their name alone can carry a film. In other cases, most notably Scorsese's Gangs of New York, the Oscar whoring by the studios make the actual art of film-making feel like an after thought. Now it is known that Harvey Weinstein, The Aviator's executive producer, has made it his personal mission to get Marty a Golden Guy. But, fortunately, this does not carry into the film itself.Leonardo DiCaprio found fame by playing off his boyish good looks in movies like Romeo + Juliet and Titanic. In those pictures it did not matter that he looked ten years younger than he actually was. Actually, that worked to his advantage. In The Aviator, however, he is playing a man and not a boy. Despite having a mustache and beard in one part, he still looks twelve. Thankfully, though, this is the biggest flaw with his performance. I'm not going to say that his acting (which is career best) over comes this short falling. I will say, though, that this 'teenage boy' did a convincing job playing a man.The Aviator documents Hughes's life from Hell's Angels through his aviation days to the onset of his OCD over taking him completely. The script, although well written in terms of dialogue and character arcs, seemed to skip over the explanation OCD, how it affected Hughes and why more strongly at some times than others. It also playes with his hearing disability, using it only when it aides in a cinematic moment and causes a bigger reaction. When the script is on fire with quick dialogue, Hughes never seems to miss a beat. When he is nervous at a movie premier, he is completely deaf to the reporter's questions.The difficult task with the film is that it contains many biographical stories. Hughes may be the main one that all the others revolve around, but due to some outstanding work by the supporting cast, the smaller parts are equally as relevant. From Gwen Stefani to Alan Alda, no one is what you expect of them. Kate Beckinsale takes a break form crap like Underworld to show that, if she tried, she could be an actress. Of course, where would this list be without Cate Blanchet, who will finally win her long deserved Oscar this year with a fabulous portrayal of Kate Hepburn; a performance against which all future Katherines will be measured. Once she gets out of the awkward caricature stage she starts out in, there is no stopping her.Even if it falls sluggish from time to time, the actors hold this one above the water. The actors and the excellent techs, that is. Now if only the Academy would award Marty so that he can go back to making movies where the trophies are the after thoughts. ****/*****",8,0,2,3 January 2005
The Village," Shyamalan's Glory Days Are Over
","Unlike his previous films, M. Knights Shyamalan's The Village is more Hollywood expectations than decent, original filmmaking. With The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs Shyamalan toyed with strange scenarios, experimental lighting and a powerful sense of honest suspense. In The Village all these elements still exist but they are overshadowed by the weak ending and stiff characterizations that keep you from being completely drawn into the film. Color has played a big role in Night's films and here it does again. Red is the bad color (The Sixth Sense, anyone?) and it is countered by yellow. The people of the village wear the strange shade of mustard hoping to protect them from whatever it is that they are so afraid of. The red things, I guess.  They live in a village that is completely set apart from any time period. Though the tombstone in the beginning says 1800, the grave is surrounded by barbed wire and the presence of plastic is not scarce. These people idealize innocence and perhaps in trying to capture this, the script abandoned plot development for this more free feeling. As the village idiot chases a blind girl through a field, the audience is still trying to figure out how any of this is relevant. It's not until more than half way through the film that there is more going on then burying the `bad color'.The Village wants to be a film that the actors carry. If the casting had gone better then maybe the whole movie would have been salvaged. But as it is the story is just not strong enough to overcome it's own faults and the poor performances of it's actors. Ron Howard's daughter (Bryce Dallas Howard) plays the blind girl, Ivy. I didn't know she was blind until someone said so. When she speaks to someone, she looks them in the eye, when she walks it's exactly where she wants to go and she's not clumsy in the awkward way she should be. Apparently Ivy has the ability to see people by the specific color they each have. This is so ridiculous it can only be explained by the fact that they had to give her something because she couldn't pull off playing someone who's blind. Oh, a quick side note about Bryce Dallas Howard: It's funny that her hair is red. That should have been a sign not to cast her. Adrien Brody, coming fresh off his Oscar win, gives the best performance of the film. It's not a hard character. He plays the slightly retarded Noah Percy. It's the usual bag of tricks: dopey eyes, laughing, clapping. See Sean Penn in I Am Sam for a better take on this type of person.There is nothing exciting about The Village. In all fairness, it doesn't deserve the trashing it has received from critics but Shyamalan disappoints here and for him, this kind of let down will hurt twice as hard. I suppose it is true that all thing that go up must come down but Night had a long way to fall and I have to say I hope he hit the bottom. Another Village and Shyamalan could be said as a flash in the pan with The Sixth Sense. Nothing can ever top that and if you can't go up, there's nowhere but down. I suppose The Village was doomed from the day `I see dead people' was penned. **1/2 out of *****",5,0,0,8 August 2004
Cold Mountain," 'Mountain' Stands Tall
","Despite the reviews of this movie and its lack of major Oscar recognition, I thought it was one of the best movies of 2003. It is not only beautiful to look at, but it is both sad and hopeful at the same time. Every scene is equally as important as the last and in the end it feels like you have actually seen the lives of these people, felt their pain and understood them through it all.The great novel that this was adapted from is just the beginning of many amazing elements that came together to make Cold Mountain a success. The screenplay does not feel like too much has been crammed into in but loosely enjoys the story that it is telling. The dialogue feels right and even though all the actors could have improved on their accents, this flaw seems to fade into the background because the actors don't place the emphasis on their words to tell the story but rather use them as one of their many tools instead of the only one as is the mistake in so many movies.And as for those actors who couldn't create the accents...well, they can create characters. Nicole lives up to her title as Academy Award winner and gives a better performance than the one that got her that title. Jude Law's character is the simplest and he knows it. You won't see him stealing any scenes from his co-stars but that is what is supposed to be. Renee is the polar opposite of that. She is the comic relief for the film and she does it with grace. Her loud and very southern character of Ruby fits her well, but then again, so does everything else she does. She just further shows us that she is one of very few actors working today with a range that has yet to be defined. She is the focus of our attention whether we want her to be or not.The entire film feels very natural and is one of the years best. ****/****",8,1,1,17 April 2004
Collateral," Cruise and Foxx
","Tom Cruise is superman as far as the American public is concerned. He is the typical everyman and that is why we love him so. He has the quality that everyone craves and he radiates the this-could-be-you-vibe like no other celebrity. In Collateral, he is the villain. Though still clothed in the everyman gray, his intentions and his heart are no longer as relatable. But yet, it's Tom Cruise, and everything he does seems to be relatable. Perhaps that's why he was the perfect choice for the anti-hero in this Michael Mann film. Jamie Foxx is a nobody to the American public. But he's on his way up. Besides having a highly buzzed film, Ray, coming out this winter, he is playing the counter part to Tom Cruise. And he's acting Cruise off the screen!!!! He's subtle and natural and plays against Cruise's intensity like no other. Together they make an excellent on-screen couple with Cruise being showy and upfront and Foxx being low-key and passive. They are, together, one person. Sometimes it takes two people to be one and here is the perfect example. They complete each other. Collateral is built on its script. Much of the film rests on the banter between Foxx and Cruise as they ride around LA in Foxx's taxi. Cruise has a few 'errands' to run and he's hired Foxx for the night. At first hesitant, Foxx eventually accepts. The plot truly is secondary and serves merely to give the actors something to talk about. The city of LA plays itself and is lit with the colorful orbs you see in the ad with Cruise. They, like the city, appear almost to be a character of their own. They are in every scene and are the only actual witnesses to the night. No one else gets to see the relationship between these two halves of a man as they assume their position as a single person in the ending scenes.Michael Mann's direction is superb. It pays attention to the details yet allows the broader aspects speak for themselves. He has composed a film of fast paced moments and small, slow conversations, each part holding its own in the big picture. There is something here that is not to be missed.****/*****",8,0,0,24 October 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Better Than the First Two!!
","J.K. Rowling showed the world the boy wizard on paper, a place where he could be whatever we wanted him to be. Now that he is on the silver screen, the audience is given a wonderful view of how one person sees the magical world of Hogwarts. However, for some people, if a director strays from the source material even a hair, the movie is immediately deemed a failure. What these people (fondly known as 'potheads') don't understand is that the books they love are many hours in length and the movies have a time crunch of 21/2 hours. And the movies are also based on the books. If a viewer can swallow that fact that movie is not the book, then The Prisoner of Azcaban will come off as an excellent film. If not, then the differences from the book will most likely distract from the fabulous scenery, the improved actors and the inspired vision of Alfonso Cuaron. Cuaron's credits include The Little Princess and Y Tu Mama Tambien. What this movie shows is a combination of Cauron's other directorial works. He captures both innocence and the lack there of in the life of thirteen year-olds. Not to say there is promiscuous sex between Ron and Hermione in every other scene (although there is foreshadowing of a future relationship) but Prisoner of Azkaban captures the actuality of life, unlike the cookie-cutter version Chris Columbus created in the first two installments of the series. All three of the principal actors have grown in their abilities since the last film. Perhaps it's the influence of a new director or maybe it's just that they've had four or five years to finally find the characters that they are playing. The whole cast, new and old, take their roles and give them the spike they need to stand out as their own. They are aided by a script that does not demand they recite such wooden dialogue as they did in the first two. The script is also much braver in cutting out material that would not have helped but just taken up time. This is where the potheads get angry but in fact this is just what the series needed.Of course, this is not a perfect movie. It still has a bit of the sense of being very rushed (although not nearly as bad as the first one) and it has some scenes that leave the viewer thinking 'WhatÂ…?'. For example, there are a couple points in the movie where story is going smoothly and then, we're walking in the garden with Lupin and Harry or we're in Lupin's office with Harry and the Professor. For a student-teacher relationship, they seem to be very good friends. Their friendship does exist in the book but not quite to the point where the movie uses it. Still, it's the only falture in the script to expand upon what's already there.It's a shame that Cuaron is not staying on, but with much of his crew and the whole cast are staying, perhaps the Potter films are headed for a bright future. Prisoner of Azkaben is a better film than both its predecessors. ***1/2/*****",8,0,0,6 November 2004
Meet the Fockers," Don't bother with the Fockers - See the original
","Meet the Fockers boasts an all-star cast, a box-office gold premise, and after all, it is the sequel to Meet the Parents. Why wouldn't you want to see it? Truth be told, it's not a bad movie. Actually, it's better than most of the run-of-the-mill comedies that get made these days. The problem with making sequels to successful movies is that the standard has been raised to heights not likely to be past. That's why you make sequels to movies like The Princess Diaries that have a built in audience already and weren't that great the first time around. If the sequel is better, both films benefit.The problem with this film lies in its desire to milk its built in jokes to death. This is essentially cheating in the comic department. It means you're too lazy to work for new laughs. Of course, if you are the follow up to Meet the Parents, you have to have a token Focker or Jinxy joke. What makes a movie, book, TV show or conversation memorable, however, is something unique. You need to conquer new territory and claim it as your own.Everyone is back form the first film. Jack is still the leader and Dina the token wife figure. Greg, or Gaylord as he is referred to now, still suffers the male nurse jokes and, as sweet as he is, we don't know how Pam puts up with all that he does. His mistakes can be forgiven but after a while you reach a point where it's overkill and even the audience is embarrassed. And speaking of embarrassed, there are the Fockers, Bernie and Roz. Not only do you have to wonder why Greg would ever let anyone meet these people but you also have to wonder how they don't notice that not everyone is as open and comfortable with their lifestyle. For example, Roz is a sex therapist who holds class in their backyard. You would think these people had never met a conservative before.There is no lack of sex humor here. In fact, often it's not humor but just a mention of Greg's deflowering with the Spanish maid when he was fifteen. Or the thumbing though Greg's baby pictures only to end up with his foreskin in the fondue pot. This is how every scene progresses, and while it's funny at first, after a time you begin to wonder how old the screenwriters are.Although those evolved could probably have had a more fulfilling experience doing another film, their careers will probably be momentarily boosted by this. People like this type of film and it is a nice escape. After all, it's far from reality. My rating is for the great cast and the over all good effort but the film has the fate of the $5 bin. ***/*****",6,3,7,30 December 2004
Before Sunset," Intimate Sequel
","I didn't see Before Sunrise. I think I should just come out and say that. I have been told that it adds an extra layer to the sequel and I have no doubts. It almost seems unfair for me to judge a movie this intimate without having seen its prequel. But on that note, it is impressive that the second half of this story could move me so. It's nothing more than one long conversation, probably a kin to ones that I have myself everyday. Yet there is something else here. There is something that is entirely relatable here yet still far enough out of our reach that we are sucked into the film because we want to know that magic that exists only in movies.The story starts with a book signing. Jesse (Ethan Hawke), the author of a novel about a women he met once upon a yesterday and never saw again, is at the final stop of his tour of Europe here in Paris. This is the only part of the movie where he is alone and he sets the stage for what is about to come. He delivers a monologue to the press about a story he wishes to write about a moment that turns into another moment and that morphs into yet another and so on. He is basically describing what is to take place for the next hour. He spys a woman in the corner. He spys Celine (Julie Delpy) in the corner. After he wraps it up, they begin to talk. And they don't stop. Occasionally they travel to a new location be it a cafÃ© or a park. Topics flow into each other Â– just as Jesse told us they would.How do you write a conversation specific to two people yet understandable to anyone? Even after seeing the film I honestly cannot tell you. There is something beyond chemistry between Hawke and Delpy. That has been transformed from life to the page by these two. The co-authored the film. In a time of adaptations from every medium possible, it is hard to pick out original screenplays that stand strong and defend their category. Before Sunset is one of those rare scripts that does. The writing is the strongest part here.This is essentially Delpy and Hawke's two man show. There is no one else of importance. They are rarely separate, even sharing the shot most of the time. They wrote the film, they star in it and for all anyone can tell, they were the only ones involved. The direction is so minimal that it is virtually non-existent. And there in lies the genius but it's funny how one simplicity can overshadow another.Before Sunset is emotional provocative in the most subtle way. Were the sun to actually set in the background, you would never notice the difference. The film is shot in real time and so the sunset would sneak up on you the way the film does. One minute there's a sun and then before you know it the sky is pink and you realize you care whether or not they end up together when it seems only minutes ago they were just two people talking about whether or not they had sex nine years ago. ****/*****",9,4,5,21 February 2005
Garden State," Quirky 'State' of Mind
","Garden State doomed itself with it's impressive marketing. Yes, that sounds odd. Shouldn't it be the other way around? Well, by doomed I mean it set a standard it couldn't meet. The marketing will make Garden State a modest gross for its size. The trailer that caught your eye back in February tries here to show that it can be more than just a three-minute collection of the film's best quirky moments. Of course there is something more than a surreal sounding song by Frou Frou but the emotions that emulate here are not as subtle and artfully brought out as they were there.Zack Braff makes his directorial debut here with a film that combines The Graduate with The Odyssey. Braff has obviously seen The Graduate and has let it inspire him. I don't think he's used to much of the existing material here and that Garden State has enough other original aspects that it's not something people should make a big stink about. The screenplay in question is actually far from the quality of The Graduate. It's overdone in an attempt to be simple. Each character presents a new use for their stereotype but they are still stereotypes nonetheless. The humor is honest and this film that could have a dark cloud hanging over the audience is actually surprisingly funny.As a director, Braff is too obvious. He's presence is in every scene and not the way M. Night Shyamalan has a presence in a trademark sense but more he goes over the top on director's gags such as color and scene construction. He spends so much time trying to capture reality and is almost on to something when he goes to a very director's shot and we are pulled out of the quirky reality and put back in the movie theater.It's nice to see that all the actors were top notch here despite their lack of good source material. Peter Sarsgaard, although his character isn't quite what it was in Shattered Glass, he is perfectly cast in this role of Braff's old friend who now does drugs and digs graves. Braff is not new or original with his performance but he keeps things moving and has potential to be good in the future. Natalie Portman may finally be making sense to me. Before all she has been is flat and annoying but with this and her turn in last years Cold Mountain, she's making a comeback form Star Wars.Garden State wants to be original and quirky. It's not really either. It also wants to be a sweet love story that shows the values of friends and family. Despite a mediocre script and some obvious errors in continuity with the editing, Garden State is a great story about what we leave behind and who we become because of them. ***1/2/*****",7,0,0,21 August 2004
Shrek 2," Shrek Under Pressure
","Shrek, the original was a breakout success that had audiences coming back again and again to see if it really was as good as they seemed to remember it. Shrek 2 has all the elements that made the first so entertaining.The cast is lead by Mike Myers who so inhabits his character that you don't realize that it's Austin Powers in another of his quirky voices that is making the kids laugh so much. He has become one of the great characters of the last decade: Shrek, that lovable green ogre that we all can relate to on one level or another. And of course, where would we be without the trusty steed? Donkey is Eddie Murphy's only tolerable role since Dr. Doolittle. He steals the show with his obvious humor more than once, just as he did in the first. Cameron Diaz, also hiding well in her animated Fiona, is charming but has the most mundane dialogue of the movie. She also has given her character an attitude that was not there in the first and scenes with her are detracted from because of this unfortunate addition.The story line is weak in the beginning half of the movie. Actually, the whole script is. It seems like a by-the-book sequel and we wonder if this is worth the hype that's been around for weeks. By the second half (the 'adventure' half) the buzz has vindicated. The new jokes, aided by the pop culture humor, are more original than any other animated movie. In the end, we get what we knew was going to happen (well, Ricky Martin wasn't expected) but that doesn't feel like a cheap, Hollywood ending because we new that when we saw the trailer. Once again, DreamWorks has scored a hit bigger than they expected. Of course this will mean an immediate green light for Shrek 3, 4, 5, etc. but that's all later and right now, Shrek 2 has held up under the expectation set by the first one. A fun, family film that, hopefully, is the perfect ending to an excellent set of movies. ***/*****",8,0,0,25 September 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Excellent!!!
","This movie held up even under my high expectations. I had heard so many good things about it, plus, I had seen so many bad movies prior to it that I needed it to be good. It was. Charlie Kaufman impressed me with his brilliant, mind-bending script Adaptation and this one was just as mentally interesting Yet, this had something that Adaptation didn't, it was a genuine love story, and a good one at that.I would classify this movie as a romantic comedy, that hardest genre to make a good movie in. Why? Because there is a formula that such movies as Runaway Bride mastered and Gigli fell victum to. What makes Eternal Sunshine work as a story is that it really plays well on the formula. Instead of following it as if they were rules/guidelines, it feels more as if the plot naturally found those required aspects of the genre.Next in line is the performance power of this unbelievable ensemble cast. With Jim Carrey in an uncharacteristic role, you expect less and get more. Kate Winslet, taking over in the Carrey's usual part, does not let us down and never once has you asking why her hair is not the same color. It just seems a natural progression of the character. Oscar nomination number four here we come.All the supporting roles are well done. The performance of Kirsten Dunst is, prehaps, one of her best. If the movie does well come awards season, she will to. As for Elijah Wood, he is solid, but probably more importantly, very much not Frodo. He will have a career with out Tolkien. He has proven that here. Part of the reason that these supporting performances work so well is because they are each given a subplot that is just shy of being its own movie. It gives all these actors something to grasp and yet they still fit with the main story; they are actually supporting it by providing a greater amount for us to connect with, making it much more believeable in our eyes. ****/****",10,0,1,17 April 2004
Man on Fire," Action over Story
","Revenge is a dish best served cold.Well, in the case of Man on Fire, revenge is a dish that needs some explaining. The movie is more a collection of impressive special f/x explosions than a story about a man seeking revenge. There is a vague feeling in the background about a girl who was kidnapped but the story (or what there is of one) neglects this and simply continues to create more people to be killed even when you're sure that everyone who could possibly have even heard of the kidnapping is already dead.Denzel Washington leads a wonderful cast and crew. He heads a film that should have had some level of decency based solely on the people who contributed to it. Washington stares as Creasy, a man with a violent past in the marines who takes on a job as a bodyguard for the daughter of a business-obsessed man living in Mexico. He tries to maintain a professional distance form the girl, named Pita (Dakota Fanning) but finds that he can't help being friends with her. Thus begins the first hour of Man On Fire, which looks like an explanation for the forthcoming crime. It is shot entirely at a distance and each portion is full of the expected. But in comparison with its sister half, the third act, the first hour comes off without a hitch.When Pita is kidnapped in a flurry of gunshots and confusing swirls of the camera, the plot less, disaster movie starts and the audience that came for something with a brain can now get up and leave for the movie next door. At this time, the audience that just came from the sneak peak of _________ (insert name of big-budget, brainless action movie. Bonus points if it is a sequel) can now enter the theater. From this point on we are introduced to a range of characters from the Mexican reporter who agrees to help Washington get all the information he wants so she can write an article on him, to the numerous Mexican hit men who could have been played by one man for how interchangeable they are. Each aids in getting a shooting or being shot while telling where the next man is. The man behind this brilliant mess of a screenplay is Brian Helgeland, who has Mystic River and L.A. Confidential to his name. And the director who gets to take all the blame is Tony Scott (Top Gun). This is proof that sometimes the big budget can go to the head instead of to good use.There are probably more gunshots, explosions and dead bodies in Man on Fire than dialogue. But half the dialogue there is should have been canned. Even the unpromted killings are more deserved than the ending that is concocted. We have to be thankful for its presence because it does end the movie, but we can't help but wish anything else had been put in its place. There isn't much more predictable than the conclusion that exists. Denzel Washington, Tony Scott and Christopher Walken fail to live up to their names and Brian Helgeland and Dakota Fanning take a step backwards in establishing theirs. This movie is a sad waste of talent that takes itself way too seriously for the joke that it is. **/*****",4,0,2,26 November 2004
The Terminal," The Terminal Hits Home
","Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks have a good track record when they team up. Not that each does not have a good record of his own, but putting the two talents together has, twice in the past resulted in success. Their latest effort, The Terminal, although a strong production, lacks something the other two possessed. It is reminiscing of Catch Me If You Can. Both feature a main character that plays the mouse just a little smarter than the cat. In Catch Me If You Can, the cat and mouse comparison is more obvious whereas in The Terminal, the cat in not trying to catch the mouse, he's trying to get rid of him. This time around Hanks is playing the mouse instead of the cat. He's a man who has become a citizen of no country during his time in the air and therefore, is forced to wait out his homeland's problems in JFK airport. Although the movie is based on true story, Spielberg and his crew have decided to leave all actual details out of their telling. The country Hanks' character, Victor Navorski, was from is fictional and whereas the man the story is based on resided in the airport for 15 years, we don't know whether or not Hanks waits out the problems for weeks, months or years.
Still, the story is not dependant on small details as is more a study of the survival of a man in a most unnatural habitat, waiting to go home. How long can you live on saltines and condiments (aka free food)? Where do you sleep? What do you do all day in an airport? The screenplay takes liberties in addressing these questions (there just happens to be a whole gate under construction for the entire duration of his stay), and if the screenplay had fallen into wrong hands, The Terminal would have been terminated. There are still moments when the film skids along the lines of disaster but usually the colorful cast brings it back to safe ground. Actually, the characters are the most believable aspect of the film. Most likely it's because they are all well acted. Hanks plays the entirety of his character arc seamlessly combining elements of the lost boy form Big, the father from Sleepless in Seattle and the resourcefulness of Forrest in Forrest Gump. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the brunet version of a blond, but it's not her fault. The male screenwriters cast her as the damsel who's in distress about life. The cast is completed by Stanley Tucci, Diego Luna, Kumar Pallana and Zoe Salana, each taking on a unique part that round out the character study of that makes up Victor's friends.
The movie is neither a drama nor a comedy. It effectively mixes the two and creates a touching, unique film about what we do for love. ***/*****",8,0,1,27 June 2004
Shall We Dance," I'd Rather Not 'Dance'
","Sometimes it seems that the film should have been a musical. Sometimes there are just too many spots where it seems more logical for the protagonist to break out in song then deliver his sorrowful speech about the human condition. In Shall We Dance? they already have the dance aspect down. The most colorful moments are the dance sequences between Jennifer Lopez and whichever man she is pulling the hand of off her ass this time.John Clark, played by a sullen Richard Gere, is happy but not happy. He wants something more from life. Despite a successful marriage to Susan Sarandon and two kids, he feels that monotony has taken over. On passing a dance studio one night on his way home, he sees the face of Lopez from the window. She externalizes everything he is feeling inside and he finds himself compelled to talk to her. Upon walking into the studio, he finds himself signed up for beginner's ballroom dancing. You know the rest Â– wife fears there's an affair, Clark discovers an actual love for dancing, befriends Lopez, they change each other's life, etc.Singin' In the Rain used dancing in the place of sex. When they're dancing together, they're sleeping together. In Shall We Dance? they may have been going for something along the same line. Why else would Jennifer Lopez spend the entire movie looking like she is about to have an orgasm? It surpasses the serious dance face that some were going for. In actuality, the dancing is the best part of the movie. It's well performed, minus a few facial expressions, and obviously had the most time put into it. Richard Gere shows the he still hasn't lost what he acquired for Chicago, although that was a smarter career move.Shall We Dance? is supposed to be a comedy. There are some funny spots but mostly the problem is that the filmmakers felt a sentimental aspect was lacking and went overboard on their attempts to fix that. Every scene is rank with a brooding Gere or Lopez. The script and acting falls second to the dancing and costuming. However, if you want to see good dancing, there are so many other movies that get that aspect at the same time as the script. See Singin' In the Rain or Chicago instead of this. **/*****",4,2,3,24 October 2004
A Walk to Remember," Not Another Teen Movie
","I don't usually like this type of movie. That is, the teenage romance that tries to have underlying messages about how we all have a soulmate and that these two people are very lucky because they have found each other so early and now if they'd just realize it.The premise is something you would see on Lifetime if you had chosen to stay home instead of going to the theater. In essense, the plot is the same as everything you see on made for TV movies but the plot is not what's so special. Both Mandy Moore and Shane West giving either career best or career making performances. They take the cheap story thrown at them and they develop a chemistry between their different characters that people of all ages can appreciate. I read the book about year after having seen the movie and I still think they did a good job adapting the novel. The movie contains all the needed parts of the book and does not drastically change anything. The humor in the book is tossed out in favor of a more somber and serious tone but that's good because it helps to set it apart from all other teen movies.***/****",8,0,0,17 April 2004
Coach Carter," 'Carter' Coached By Formula
","Coach Carter ***/*****There have been a slew of sports stories to hit the multiplex in the last few years. They all have enough in common that we get tired of them yet they each have their own 'thing' that makes them unique enough that we go to see them just to see what this story has that the others didn't. The inspirational, uplifting, based on a true story sports tales are a dime a dozen because, essentially, every athlete is one of these stories. What makes the boys of Friday Nigh Lights any different that your local high school football team? What makes coach Carter's players any different than any other teenage boys?In the latest version of 'talented players with bad coach get good coach and start winning', Samuel L. Jackson plays coach Cater who comes to coach at his old high school where more kids end up in prison that end up with college diplomas. He is on a mission not only to improve the game record for the basketball team but to also improve the academic standing of his players. The boys live in a predominantly poor black neighborhood and all the stereotypes of this lifestyle show up to bat. Boy who's girlfriend is pregnant, the tough guy who hangs with his older cousin and gets into trouble although the camera makes it painfully obvious that he will be 'saved' in the end and the one who tries to be that 'savior'. Perhaps the movie shouldn't be ridiculed for following formula. After all, that is what sells and if movies didn't make back their costs, we'd have to find new ways to spend Friday nights. But the problem with formula is that we get tired of it when it's over used and man oh man is this formula getting old. It's almost akin to watching the day in life of anybody played before your eyes over and over and over again. You know who is going to say what, when and why and after a while you stop caring. The inspirational speeches coaches give at halftime of the pivotal game don't actually exist, you know.But, like romantic comedies, horror and thriller films, when formula is twisted in some way or another, the movies are better than those that never had a pattern to work with in. The Sixth Sense is the classic horror film with a twist. It just happened to be such a good twist that it essentially became its own sub-genre of thriller films. A film like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is just a romantic comedy. It's justÂ…backwardsÂ…and sideways. Whatever. The point is that it's a distorted version of what we're used to and, as a result, it has become a film with a growing fan base that is loyal to the extent that they might as well be called a cult. Coach Carter, although not exactly revolutionary in the ways these two films are, had a chance to be. There is an entire sub-plot devoted to the academic progress of the basketball players. 'They're student athletes. Student comes first.' The point where this story is wrapped up also coincides with an ending of sorts to the athlete story. If, at this point, the filmmakers had chosen to end the film, they would have created a story more about the student than the athlete, making them not just another based on a true story sports film.",7,0,1,21 February 2005
The Bourne Supremacy," Bourne For Success
","The Bourne Supremacy is this summer's perfect companion to Spiderman. It follows the same rules of ordinary person with amazing powers but at the same time, giving this person some emotion such as doubt and fear. Catwoman, released this weekend as well, is like the weaker cousin to these two. It's not that girl power isn't cool but it needs to be treated with the same maturity that the old fashion man gets.Maturity is what sets Bourne aside from his closest comparison. Bond, James Bond. Not that age is the gauge here but Matt Damon's Jason Bourne is more serious and less happy-go-lucky-I-think-I'll-forget-my-mission-and-go-talk-to-this-girl in his manner. Hence the lack of abrupt stops for a half naked woman to coo softly `Oh, Jason' during this film.The emotional tone of this movie is created in a very honest way. If the scene calls for the audience to be on edge, the camera does not dart behind the hero and take him into dark areas where it is hard to see what might jump out next. Cheap sight gags are a dime a dozen in most suspenseful movies and even though Ã‚â€˜Supremacy' is not a suspense driven feature, it comes with its share of uncertainty.Actually, uncertainty is a major tone. It speaks of Bourne's lack of knowledge about himself and his past. The camera takes on a very loose feel during a hand-to-hand combat scene and that puts the audience just far enough out that we can't tell exactly what's happening. It doesn't help that both men look alike and are clothed in all black. We are unaware of how Bourne is faring and that puts us in his mind set. At the same time that we feel this way, however, Damon gives his character an almost unreal sense of knowing everything. Maybe he doesn't know why but he still can figure things out fast and seems to know exactly what to do all the time. He always knows where he is going and what he's going to do when he gets there. He also has this amazing way of knowing what his opponent is going to do.The plot is not over looked in this movie in exchange for high-speed car chases and extensive damage for no reason. Yes, these exist too but not in the same way that they do in movies like Independence day or Minority Report. What drives the plot is the supporting cast actually. Bourne spends a lot of time getting from here to there and occasionally will move the story in a new direction but not as much as his cast mates. The strongly written part (played by Joan Allen) of the CIA member looking for Bourne is aided by the return cast member Julia Stiles showing that she is stronger in supporting than in lead (don't see The Prince and Me). Both women display a strong screen presence and the girl power that Catwoman was trying for. ****/*****",7,0,1,24 July 2004
