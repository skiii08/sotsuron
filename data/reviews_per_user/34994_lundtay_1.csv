","This was an awesome movie. It made me laugh, it scared me, made me jump, had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I honestly do not recommend bringing your young children. It does involve cussing and sexual language. But if old enough, I highly recommend. Pennywise is well done, the plot of the story sets up a great sequel and I am very excited for the next one.",8,3,5,21 September 2017
