Casablanca," my thoughts
","this movie is rightly a classic. let me just say that I love this movie. it is one my top ten of all time favorites and number one on classic movies.

This movie has every thing love, mystery, suspense, guns, good music.",Null,2,3,2 May 2012

The Graduate," my thoughts
",I thought this was a very interesting movie.you could really see how the times were changing not just in the country but in the film industry as well. also one thing I really enjoyed was the music used in this movie. one little thing that I also wanted to mention was when he's driving to stop her wedding and he runs out of gas and the slowing of the music co-insides with the slowing and stoping of the car. and i also feel that the ending of the movie was brilliant the fact that he set out to do something and accomplished it. the fact that they made this huge statement and ran away together on a bus. they sit and are happy and rejoice for the moment only to both realize what they did think... now what. i feel that that really portrayed how the youth of that generation felt... now what,Null,1,1,24 April 2012
