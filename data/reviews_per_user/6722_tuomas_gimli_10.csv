Howl's Moving Castle," Far from Miyazaki's best
","Howl's Moving Castle has the potential to be probably the best Ghibli film ever, and that already is an insanely high remark. All the elements are there: gorgeous animation, interesting story, a beautifully crafted world and perhaps the most fun and imaginative cast of characters Ghibli has ever brought on screen. Yet, staggeringly , the elements never quite come together, and the end result feels more like a collection of bits than one coherent whole.The story is ultimately the movie's downfall: whereas previous Miyazaki films have had either a strong narrative (Laputa, Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke), or a character-focused approach with barely any story (Totoro, Ponyo), Howl's Moving Castle falls somewhere in the middle and suffers gravely for it. There are many strong characters with their own stories, yet there is also the main plot to keep track of, and these two ultimately don't mix. The main focus seems to get lost time after time, as plot twists appear seemingly without any setup. It's also strangely difficult to describe Howl's character: Is he a superficial douche? Is he a wise and kind yet young wizard? Is he a cold bystander or a tormented power tool torn by his indecision? I myself never really figured it out.But all the things Miyazaki is known for are still here: the animation is beyond beautiful, the score is great (if not very memorable), the sheer amount of imagination brought on-screen is amazing and the characters, especially Calcifer, are delicately crafted and all likable. It's just sad that the messy story overwhelms these aspects, and the end result feels uneven and in need of streamlining.Recommendation: This movie will undoubtedly be understood better by those who have read the novel. For those who haven't I would recommend adjusting your expectations. Don't watch this movie for the story, just let yourself drown in the visuals and the atmosphere.",6,0,1,2 November 2012
Sucker Punch," Explosively appalling
","Sucker Punch fails so spectacularly in so many ways it's actually kind of interesting. How could an acclaimed, visually accomplished director making the ultimate geek fantasy with tens of millions of dollars end up creating something this rubbish? First, the characters, or lack thereof. The girls simply have no personality and differ from each other in no other ways than height and cup size. They hardly show any emotion and there's nothing to show what kind of people they are. The same applies to all the other characters with the possible exception of the villain, but only because someone has to be the bad guy. The acting is as good as the characters, i.e. terrible, but you're so detached from the movie anyway it hardly matters.Second, the visuals. One would assume on the basis of the trailer that the movie would at least evoke visual interest, but fails even at that. It's simply too much: once you've seen one amazing scenario you kind of zone out and it all becomes white noise. Zack Snyder's love for slo-mo is at its very worst here: the movie feels like it's been directed by a 12-year old who can't sit still for 5 seconds without going 'PHWOOOOAARR ISN'T THAT COOL?!' And since all the visuals are done with CGI, none of the action sequences have any physicality or tension to them. It's about as exciting as watching marshmallows getting dropped on a silk mattress in 0,1 gravity.Third, the soundtrack. All I can remember is a cacophony of electric guitars and techno beats. In conjunction with the visuals it becomes simply too overwhelming, going in one ear and coming out the other.These are only the main problems of the film, but the way they combine and create new problems is quite amazing. The end result is one of the stupidest, most juvenile and boring films released this century.Recommendation: I can't recommend this film to anyone. Not even movie masochists, because unlike other atrocious sludge like Sex and the City 2, SPunch isn't even painful to watch, it's simply boring. Boring beyond words.",1,6,14,5 December 2012
The Big Lebowski," Gets better with every viewing
","The Big Lebowski is simply a joy to watch, and gets better with every viewing. There's simply so much to see, from the absurd musical sequences to the sociopathic behavior of John Goodman's character Walter Sobchak. Just trying to make sense of the convoluted and completely ridiculous plot is a game onto itself. The movie has an enormous amount of quotable lines and the dialogue is some of the Coen brothers' finest.The characters are all imaginative and memorable, with Jeff Bridges and John Goodman wrestling for the best part. Goodman's Walter Sobchak is easily one of the most unsympathetic and frankly crazy Vietnam-vet characters in cinema, what with him constantly referring to his battles in Vietnam or spouting obscenities at everyone in sight. But Bridges' the Dude is just as charming: writing a cheque of 0,69$, crashing his car after dropping a joint on his lap and constantly drinking white russians. Even the small characters like the side-splittingly hilarious Jesus Quintana, the police chief of Malibu or the black taxi driver you will laugh at time and time again. The amount of small but memorable characters is almost too much to count.The movie has some issues, though. Because of the narrative being so convoluted and not being the point anyway, the film feels at times like a series of isolated sketches than a consistent whole. It can also be very confusing for first time viewers who will try to follow the plot. To fully enjoy this movie one has to be in a certain mindset.Recommendation: Like all Coen brothers films, The Big Lebowski is not for everyone. But for those who enjoy this sort of comedy, finding a better film of this sort is hard.",9,5,9,2 January 2013
My Neighbor Totoro," So freaking ADORABLE!
","My Neighbor Totoro is Studio Ghibli's crown jewel, and for a reason. No other film captures the innocence and wonder of childhood so perfectly, yet also takes the viewer to an emotional roller-coaster with lovable characters and a magical atmosphere. Totoro will leave anyone with a soul smiling for hours after finishing it.To count the plot of Totoro is next to pointless, as there hardly is one. Two girls move to a new house with their dad and they meet the forest spirits. That's it. Totoro doesn't exist to tell a story, it exists to spark the wonder and joy of childhood in anyone who's ever lived it. The scenes which the mere thought of can make you smile are almost too many to count: the first encounter with Totoro, the magical flying top ride, the cat bus and so on. Magical is truly the key word here, and the adorability reaches almost unbearable levels.The visuals have truly stood the test of time. Despite having been released only 2 years after Castle in the Sky and simultaneously with Grave of the Fireflies, the visuals are thoroughly convincing. Backgrounds are detailed and the animation is smooth and realistic. Butas with any Ghibli film, the true might of Totoro lies in its atmosphere. It captures the innocence of childhood without feeling pandering or idyllic. The characters and places feel real, and not some faraway fantasy land: the kid next door can be mean, buses don't always arrive on time, the characters aren't perfect. Partly this is thanks to the absolutely MARVELOUS Japanese voice cast who bring every character fully to life, the highlight being the two girls for whom we truly feel. When the tension racks up a bit towards the end you will truly feel the desperate confusion they're going through. One could keep going for hours like this. Totoro is as good as all-ages (and that is truly the case here, don't you dare say otherwise) films can get. That's all I can say.Recommendation: A must-see for EVERYONE.",10,0,2,12 November 2012
The Lego Movie," Everything is indeed awesome
","I'd be surprised if anyone saw this coming. The Lego Movie is quite simply unlike anything seen in a long while: rip-roaringly hilarious, gorgeous to look at, imaginative beyond belief, a great parody of worn out 'chose one' clichés and also rather poignant and touching. The first thing one has to mention is the animation. Not only does it look like an amateur stop-motion film with a $500 million budget, but the amount of detail and creativity put into the visuals is just staggering. At times there's so much going on the screen it's almost overwhelming, yet if you look closely you can see that every single thing is comprised of recognizable Lego parts. The various ways the world shifts, breaks, is constructed again, falls apart and moves around is simply a joy to watch. The implementation of real-world objects into the otherwise plastic world is certain to get huge laughs out of anyone, especially the revelation about the ominous superweapon 'Kragle'. The result is a film that looks unlike anything we've seen before.The script is a roller-coaster ride of hilarious gag after another. The jokes come at you so fast you can't catch them all in one viewing, and blink-and-you'll-miss-it side gags clutter the screen. No running gag wears out its welcome, no joke is overplayed or overemphasised. The characters are all funny and likable with enough personality to them to fill up multiple movies on their own. Batman especially is a riotous parody of the grim, dark versions of the Caped Crusader we've been stuck with for nearly a decade. And due to Lego having rights for nearly every IP imaginable, you won't be able to guess which mega-franchise is going to turn up next. Despite all this high praise, there are a couple of minor issues. During its third act the tone of the film starts moving to a more serious and emotional direction, which to me didn't work as well as the rapid fire comedy of the rest of the film. The voicework is great for the most part, but amidst all the others it becomes rather apparent that Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson are live, not voice actors. It's not that their performances are bad, they just seem rather flat and lifeless in comparison to the rest of the cast. The Lego movie is a downright masterpiece, there's no two ways about it. Incredible visuals and animation combined with a hilarious script, dazzling creativity and good characters make it one of the best and most original animated films in a long time. Some minor hindrances can do very little to drag it down, and the end result is fantastic.",9,103,133,11 March 2014
Wreck-It Ralph," A triumph
","Wreck-it Ralph is without a doubt one of the best animated films of the last few years. Though advertised as the ultimate love letter to video games, it's actually more of a story about identity and redemption that merely happens to take place in the world of video games. Though that's not to say there aren't tons of references to video games both old and new, and they will definitely keep hardcore gamers satisfied. The references are handled tastefully, and the film never feels like pandering to a specific audience though obscure references and inside jokes.The characters are truly what makes the film work. Ralph's dissatisfaction with his life is understandable, but it's never made black and white that he would be right and everyone else wrong. Sarah Silverman's character Vanellope starts out as annoying and hyperactive, but eventually grows on the audience. There is one genuinely tragic moment between Vanellope and Ralph that almost had me in tears. The supporting characters are also well handled, and Sergeant Calhoun in particular makes an odd case of being so much more than what she's supposed to, i.e. a brutal parody of the 'badass chick' trope seen in many video games. But she actually has depth to her.The movie is also side-splittingly hilarious. Though getting the references gets you slightly more laughs out of the film, most of the comedy is universally understandable. The visuals are breathtakingly beautiful, and the landscapes in 'Sugar Rush' (a racing game where most of the film takes place) show some true imagination and inventiveness. Mentioning that the voice acting is superb feels almost pointless. This is Disney we're talking about, after all. Towards the end there is a surprising twist I honestly did not see coming, and those are always a plus.If one would want to search for gripes in this movie, the biggest one would probably be its length. It's not too long, about a 105 minutes, but towards the end you may start thinking when the movie is truly going to end. There's also quite a lot of rules the film has to establish in order to make the world make sense, but they don't take up too much time.But aside from those, I can find very little to criticize about Wreck-it Ralph. This is quite simply a masterpiece of animated cinema, and I definitely hope to see this particular world explored more.",10,2,2,17 March 2013
The Bourne Legacy," Garbage
","I went to see this film without having seen the previous Bourne movies. I had heard you wouldn't really need to have seen them to understand and enjoy this. Yes, I did understand the film, as it's fairly removed from the other movies, features mostly new characters and a simple plot. There are some entertaining parts in this movie, like the scene in the manor. Jeremy Renner is always a good action hero, and the acting overall is actually quite good.Did I enjoy the film? No.I cannot remember seeing a movie in a theater and feeling both bored to death and physically ill at the same time. The constant shaky-cam and the weird, extreme closeup -fixated cinematography create a strange, almost nauseating mess of images that isn't terribly hard to follow, but most of the time feels completely pointless. Despite being over 2 hours long, the story feels like it cuts off about two thirds into itself, and is still terribly messy. The pacing is all over the place, and it gets an awful long time for the plot to actually get moving. The story moves from A to B to C without any sense of weight or meaning. The final big action scene seems to go on for ever and ever, and when it ends, it ends just as abruptly as the movie. I'm actually having a hard time writing this review, because I can't recall much of any specific plot points or events, just a blurry haze. All in all, The Bourne Legacy felt like a missed opportunity to take an old action franchise into a new direction. I actually flipped the bird at the silver screen in frustration when the credits rolled. I felt like I had wasted a good 2 hours of my life.Just your average whiz-bang-crunch-vroom -fest with nothing special or interesting about it.",3,1,4,31 October 2012
Castle in the Sky," Classic fantasy adventure, plain and simple
","Castle in the Sky is the first film by Studio Ghibli, released originally in 1986. It is every bit as good as one would expect from a Ghibli film: beautiful animation and art, colourful and memorable characters, great score and a good story.The story concerns a boy named Pazu who on one day sees a girl called Sheeta falling from the sky. Together they set out to find the legendary flying castle of Laputa. The story is well paced and truly an adventure: by the end the small village Pazu used to live in feels like the distant past.The first thing I should say is this is A GREAT FILM. It's well written, beautifully animated and overall masterfully executed. Yet Studio Ghibli has produced so many fantastic films that this one stands out as a more simplistic story. There's not the ecological message of Nausicaä, the overwhelming adorability of Totoro or the grim moral ambiguity of Mononoke. After watching it twice I still haven't detected much of an overarching theme or message overall. Also the female lead, Sheeta, is somewhat disappointing as more of a typical damsel in distress. This is a bit jarring considering Ghibli's history of producing strong female characters one after another (Chihiro, San, Nausicaä, Satsuki, the list goes on).The animation is good and the visual design is very impressive. Still, some of the technical aspects are hopelessly dated: the animation can be choppy at times, and the characters are fairly devoid of detail. Though considering just how much happens in the film, the simplistic designs are somewhat forgivable, especially when we see entire armies on-screen at times.But mostly this is just nitpicking. Castle in the Sky is a wonderful, imaginative piece of fantasy adventure, and shows more creativity, personality and imagination in 5 minutes than most mainstream films show in 500 minutes.Recommendation: A must-see for any fan of fantasy cinema or Studio Ghibli. For everyone else, highly recommended.",9,0,0,11 November 2012
Toy Story 3," No criticisms
","I cannot think of any faults or criticisms for this movie. I fail to find even a single flaw or tiniest nitpick in any of the film's aspects. I consider this a good candidate for the title of the greatest movie of all time.Every single thing is polished to a mirror shine. The story is full of humor, sadness, tension and loveliness. The characters are all hilarious and likable, yet they all have distinct personalities and traits. The animation is beyond gorgeous and the movie is full of colour, which is used very effectively to create a matching atmosphere for each scene. The comedy, both physical and verbal is brain-debilitatingly hilarious, especially a certain scene involving Buzz Lightyear and the word 'reset'.There's really no point to continue this any further. This movie is as close to perfection as can be. If you haven't seen it, you should feel bad.",10,2,5,28 October 2012
Princess Mononoke," A fantastic epic with a problematic second half
","If Studio Ghibli's fantasy films were a menu, Nausicaä and Laputa would serve as appetizers for the main course which is Mononoke. It is a grim, adult fantasy epic which deals with heavy themes in a mature way. It doesn't ask simple questions, nor does it give simple answers and its only moral shades are of grey. It is fantasy fiction at its finest, and magnificently realized.Which sadly makes the few flaws it has all the more apparent.Mononoke has a theme of man vs. nature. However, instead of going the Avatar route, Mononoke presents both sides as fully fleshed out, and neither of them seems better or worse than the other. This is perhaps Mononoke's greatest strength: real-feeling moral ambiguity where wrong and right are shady at best.Mononoke has also a multitude of other things going for it: the animation and art are gorgeous, and don't seem dated in any way. The music is among Joe Hisaishi's best, and that is not something you can say lightly. The action scenes are perhaps the most visceral and thrilling in all of the Ghibli films, and Miyazaki's imagination outdoes 99% of mainstream cinema.Mononoke has only two major flaws, but sadly they can't be ignored. The first is the main characters: they're believable and well developed, but there's an odd lack of emotion to them. Ashitaka, for example, doesn't seem to display much else than cold indifference or steely determination. I also would have liked the hinted romance to have been explored a bit more. It clearly is there, why not go for it? The second, and biggest, problem with the film are its around last 45 minutes. In short, the whole story and all plot threads are solved in one long, intense action sequence which takes up most of the film's second half. The intensity is kept high for the whole time with little pause for breath, and eventually it does get tiring. I think it could have been done better. Also the ending feels quite abrupt after the long action sequence, as the 'what happened next?' question is answered with only a few short scenes, and then we cut to the credits. There could at least have been an image montage during the credits like in Totoro.Recommendation: Despite my criticisms, Mononoke is in the end a great film and practically obligatory to see for any who consider themselves anime fans. Must-see for Ghibli fans, heartily recommended for anyone else",8,1,3,16 November 2012
