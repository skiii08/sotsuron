The King's Speech," One of the best British films in cinematic history. Sensational.
","I initially put off seeing The King's Speech when it first came out despite knowing and liking actors like Colin Firth and Helen Bonham Carter. The reason was because I'm not really that interested in the Royal family and didn't know anything about the true story, but curiosity of the amazing hype this has received from film critics in the newspapers and audience reviews alike on here propelled me to go and see it. When arriving and I noticed at other screenings in the past two weeks when I had gone to see other films, I saw two things loads of people going in to see it and that the majority were middle-aged and older. I don't know if it's been the same at other screenings across the country, but that was the general population of the type of people that went in, but that didn't deter me. I entered the cinema and the Que was long and the screening I was in was literally fully packed, but this didn't mean the hype conjured was accurate. I was wrong. At the end quite literally I was speechless.First of all though a brief synopsis of the movie. Basically set in the 1920s and 30s, this tells the story of how King George VI (Colin Firth) who had a stammering problem when speaking receives help from an Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush)to control his stammering so he can do speeches, whilst his supported by his wife Queen Elizabeth (Helen Bonham Carter). Throughout George or Bertie as most of his family and friends call him tries to gain more confidence as eventually he takes the throne over from his brother who is forced to abdicate. Lionel and George strike an unlikely friendship as he helps him prepare for a speech which we will see the King guide England through the war against Germany.First off to say the cinematography is marvellous with a detail which is superbly rich from the costumes, vehicles and buildings of the time. I was transfixed throughout visually marvelling at it, the script was excellently written with mature and witty dialogue, with some hilarious laughs. For the first hour the story only interested me, but by the second hour it had gripped me. This was due to the incredible performances across the board. Colin Firth deserves an Oscar for his performance. He gives the performance of his life, it's the best acting I've ever seen him do and one of the finest I've ever seen in film. You feel for his character of King George who wants to do his duty but resents it at the same time as he tries hard to overcome his stammering. He is also extremely warm hearted as he just wants to make his wife and children proud. Geoffrey Rush is brilliant as Lionel with a quirkiness for the character who is intelligent but quick witted. The scenes with Rush and Firth are some of the best in the whole film, Helen Bonham Carter deserves to be mentioned and should receive at least an Oscar nomination. She with the right material is a genius of an actress and gives a magnificent supporting performance. Also small cameos by Timothy Spall as a sympathetic Winston Churchill and Michael Gambon as George's father are superb and make the most of their screen time. This really is a moving and riveting film and the thing I loved was that the friendship between Bertie and Lionel never became sentimental. Director Tom Cooper wisely restrained that and it makes the film all the more moving and charming for it. When Bertie makes the speech near the end I was silently praising him as he went through. He had a lot of courage and it showed. At the end everyone including me clapped. This truly is one of the best British films in history and deserves a handful of awards. 2011 certainly is becoming a memorable year for movies as I saw four previously which were either very good or exceptional. The King's Speech is exceptional and is one of the most unforgettable films of our time. Seriously go and see this, even if you don't know about the story or have much interest in royalty. You might be shockingly surprised like I was. The King's Speech is the best film of the year so far and even though for me there are a couple of serious contenders, they will have to work hard to triumph over this. Either way this is one movie that is very difficult to forget. Absolutely sensational.",10,4,9,19 January 2011
Angels & Demons," A brilliant book adaptation!
","The Da Vinci Code was a film that was far too over analytical making it slow and losing tense and pace unlike the book. Angels and Demons has an entirely different outset. It still explores the story efficiently but is more fast paced, tense and leaves room for more action and thrills. Ron Howard has expertly and correctly kept truly faithful to the book. Tom Hanks delivers another excellent performance as Robert Langdon and I was very impressed with Ewan McGregor as the Camerlengo and the script and dialogue is sharp and the twist at the end is unexpected unless you have read the book. This should appeal to intellects and fans of the books.Obviously Dan Brown's books have stirred up lots of controversy particularly Angels and Demons among the Catholic community, which is fair enough. It can be very insulting in that sense, but as an atheist I wasn't bothered and lets face it at the end of the day the idea that any of this could happen of the Camerlengo poisoning his own Pope and using anti-matter to reunite religion is so absurd, it comes on to the extreme of preposterousness. So as a result I don't take it seriously and just see it as trashy entertainment, though it is a bit off putting that a lot of the facts Brown associates with the book as true actually aren't, but I was happy to look past it. Overall I loved this movie but I can certainly see why this is would divide opinion not just with religious Catholics, but fans of the book. But I thought it was brilliant anyway. Go and see it and make up your own mind.",9,0,3,7 December 2010
Black Swan," A completely riveting and emotionally intense experience. Full of beauty and hauntingly atmospheric. Another Aronofsky masterpiece.
","Well that's done it. I didn't think it would be possible. The chances must be astronomical. Three Oscar winning films in a month! First 127 Hours and then The King's Speech and now Aronofsky's third cinematic masterpiece triumph in a row. Black Swan for me has overtaken The King's Speech to take the top spot. Aronofsky's Black Swan is cinema at it's most serious, creative like art full of rich beauty and swirling darkness. This is Aronofsky's best film so far for many reasons. But first a brief synopsis. Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) lives at home with her controlling domineering mother Erica (Barbara Hershey) who wants the 'best' for her daughter as Nina is a professional ballerina dance. Her mum encourages and pushes her as she's an ex-dancer herself who gave up her career to bring up Nina supposedly as she says. Artistic director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) decides to replace his prime ballerina Beth Macintyre (Winona Ryder) for his production of 'Swan Lake' where one ballerina will be chosen to be the Swan Queen and be the White Swan, a sign of beauty, virginity and fragility and the Black Swan representing darkness, strength and seductiveness. Nina gets the part. She is fine playing the White Swan, but finds it very hard to produce her other side. Leroy 'helps' her by trying to seduce her and she pushes him away, signalling strength. Another ballerina Lily (Mila Kunis) supposedly befriends her, but throughout as Nina becomes infatuated with Leroy she becomes convinced that Lily is out to steal her part and get Leroy for herself. She tries to become the Swan Queen by pushing herself to the extreme as her life spirals out of control. She's starts becoming obsessed with being the perfect Swan Queen due to the fact she takes drugs and is controlled by her mother. She starts going insane. We really get inside the character's head of Nina. Aronofsky uses surrealism for dark images of her mental breakdown along with cleverly using music and sound effects along with costumes and truly exquisite cinematography to signify both Nina's light (white) and dark side (black). As the white swan we see her struggle to please her mother and Leroy and gain confidence herself to believe she can fulfil the role of swan queen. At the same time she struggles with her virginity when Leroy asks her how many boyfriend's she's had and tells her to really transcend herself and immerse herself into the role of the black swan she has to feel herself. Her dark side comes out later as she defy's her mother, takes drugs and has sex with Lily. Aronofsky uses also to magnificent effect, special effects and makeup to unsettle the audience with Nina's state of mind as she turns into the black swan, like when her eyes turn red, or you see her actually turn into a black swan and dancing with her prince swan. Natalie Portman herself dances beautifully and is excellent, she moves fluidly and gracefully with aching beauty, which cleverly mirrors the creative cinematography of the different colours of white and black. The way Aronofsky himself has shot the film with hand-held camera and editing which in itself is fluid and graceful like Nina's dancing. Also the pacing of the film never flagged throughout and where lots of films feel the need to drag themselves out needlessly, Black Swan dosen't and still retains that in-depthness of exploration of the characters and their aspirations. The performances are equally astounding. Natalie Portman who I have seen acting in a few films gives a performance I have never thought possible. It is indescribable really. It is absolutely astoundingly, positively sensational. She gives Nina such depth, you feel really the emotional intensity of what Nina is going through as reality and fantasy is distorted and reflections of both her personalities (cleverly jutxapositioned with the use of mirrors) comes out. Portman is actually quite terrifying at times as you hate her and care for her at the same time. The film played so much on my mind and reached me so deeply that I had to remember that the cinema I was in was the reality for a while. Portman deserves without a doubt best actress at the Oscars. Of course the other actors cannot be ignored. Vincent Cassel as Leroy is memorably sleazy and strict as the art director, Barbara Hershey is excellent in a harrowing role as Nina's mum and gives her character depth as well. Winona Ryder is utterly superb in her short scenes as Beth who is broken down realising she is at the end of her days. But the second best acting was Mila Kunis as Lily. She was quite literally amazing and gave clarity to her character and dominated her scenes with maturity I never thought possible. She was reasonable in The Book Of Eli and funny in the comedy Date Night but they weren't serious films. This is and she played well high of the expectations I expected of her.So it comes down to it, Black Swan is Aronofsky's finest so far. He deserves an Oscar for best director as Portman does for best actress. But also the making of it is a triumph as well as it really taps into the audience's mind and explores the issue of mental deterioration incredibly well with it being sensitively handled and we feel we are experiencing Nina's journey with her. Everyone should see this, particularly those who like Aronofsky or have a taste of surrealism. This is cinema at it's finest. I would bet for me this will remain one of the best film's of the year. It will be exceptionally difficult for any other movies on hand this year to top Black Swan as it is truly remarkable in every sense of the word and deserves to be hailed as a cinematic classic for decades to come. Truly a sensational masterpiece of our time.",10,1,3,22 January 2011
Changeling," A true cinema masterpiece of film history!
","Clint Eastwood has established himself as one of not just one of America's greatest actors and directors, but his influence and inspiration to many in the film industry and die-hard Clint fans alike.Some of his best films noticeably The Dirty Harry movies being one of the most famous. I could rhapsodise about countless others, but then I would be veering off with what the review should be about, which is this film Changeling.Sufficed to say Eastwood promises so much and once again delivers. This true fact story is basically about a single mother Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) in 1920s Los Angeles whose son Walter goes missing when she comes home from work.Five months later the LAPD call with the news that her son has been found. Captain J.J Jones (Jefferey Donovan) escorts her to the train station. But it turns she's not his son and despite all evidence to the contrary the LAPD dismiss her claims.The more she tries to insist the boy they have bought back is not her son the more mentally unhinged she seems and eventually Captain Jones declares her unfit mother who has gone insane and throws her into a Pcychiatric institution.I could go on but sufficed to say she fight back and campaign's to expose the police corruption and help find what happened to her son with the help of Reverend Gustav Brieglib (John Malkovich) and pro bono lawyer S.S Hahn (Geoff Pierson) Eventually a man named Gordon Northcott is apprehended for the crime (Jason Butler Harner) and the whole case changes LA forever.This film is 141 minutes long. You might think quite a stretch but the story is so interesting and gripping. The time will fly by. Credit has to go Eastwood first of all. His direction is flawless. He has an attitude where he actually wants to tell a story not merely turn a profit.The design of 1920s Los Angeles is marvellous to visual at. The tone and the essence of the period is captured beautifully with the vehicles of the time to the costumes worn of the period.Eastwood knows precisely what camera angles to use from when Jolie is anguished at her son going missing, but he never overdoes it. He gives the actors there chance to breathe and reveal there characters in real depth and understanding and allows them to explore there own abilities.What also helps is the immaculate performances given off. There isn't a weak one anywhere. To say the acting is excellent is an understatement. There is Oscar winning stuff here. Jolie for example gives the performance of her life. She plays Christine so convincingly, the audience (I certainly did) feel the pain and suffering of every scene. This movie has done Jolie wonders. In other films like Tombraider or Mr. and Mrs Smith she has come off a good actress but her image has always been thrust into the limelight. Not in Changeling, her acting is raw and real.It's not just Jolie that is terrific here but Jason Butler is memorably creepy as Northcott, Jefferey Donovan as Jones dominates his scenes with a malevolent energy that radiated to the audience. Great support comes from Malkovich who is back on top form from the dismal Burn After Reading and Geoff Pierson is on strong form as Christines lawyer Another excellent performance comes from Micheal Kelly as detective Lester Ybarra whose investigation blew the Collins case wide open.Screenwriter J. Micheal Straczynski has to be mentioned. He actually researched the story and it was ninety five percent accurate which is an incredible accomplishment.The themes explored of justice, police corruption and male dominance over women are explored in great depth through the characters performances and are terrifically relevant to today. Changeling will have you moved (as it is disturbing) and inspired to the last scene and Eastwood has one again conclusively delivered another masterpiece. This film was surely go down not just one of his greatest movies and not just of this year but of all time.I implore you to see this film. It is storytelling in the making and I could not criticise any of it. This was flawless.",10,3,5,17 October 2009
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," The second outing with Holmes and Watson is just as fun and action packed as it's predecessor. Terrific entertainment!
","Guy Richie's modern take on Sherlock Holmes for me has been interesting and refreshingly different. The first film I wasn't sure what to expect but it bought out a terrific comedy duo between Holmes (Robert Downey Junior) and Watson (Jude Law)thanks to a witty script, excellent acting and exciting action.Their second promises more of the same and delivers. Coming up against Holmes ultimate Nemesis Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris). They suspect him of dozens of killings across Europe in a plot to start a world war as he is into arms manufacturing. They are joined by Madam Simza Heron (Noomi Rapace) from the Swedish version of the excellent Millienium Trilogy films and come into contact with Holmes brother Mycroft (Stephen Fry). The story is quite predictable as we know who the villain is from the outset unlike the first one, which did have more of a mystery. The women of course like the first outing are criminally underused, though Noomi Rapace gives a great performance and makes the most impact of the limited female characters on screen. Another criticism is even though Jared Harris gives a good performance as Moriarty, he just wasn't as menacing or have as a sly demeanour as Mark Strong who played Lord Blackwell. However I loved everything else though the film did start off a bit slow, once it got going it was at it's best. Robert Downey Junior and Jude Law give excellent performances once again, which are just so much fun to watch, particularly Downey Junior who just makes the role of Holmes seem so effortless to carry out, it's almost bewildering in it's simplicity of his portrayal. Of course what makes this comedy duo so fantastic is that script, which is just as wise-cracking and witty as the first one and though some of the comedy is quite silly, it is meant to be in a funny and goofy way as this whole movie just has the air of not taking itself seriously, which made it a real delight to watch. Special mention must also go to Stephen Fry as Mycroft though in a cameo appearance he makes the most of in a hilarious and cracking performance. Guy Richie's directing is equally exquisite with wonderful scenery and editing of slow-motion during the action sequences, which were choreographed to the highest quality, with plenty of excitement attached. The musical score is also wonderful. Though I did have a few gripes with the film (not every movie is perfect, even the ten of out ten movies). I loved this from start to finish. This is one movie and franchise that knows how to have a heck of a fun time and lets it audience experience the same feeling. Let's have a third one please!",9,1,6,23 December 2011
Source Code," Another terrific sci-fi thriller that more than lives up to the hype.
","The years 2009 and 2011 in the film world have one thing in common and that is a superb year for the science fiction genre. In 2009 there were three, District 9, Star Trek and the very underrated Surrogates. This year so far there have been two, Limitless and now Source Code. When I first heard about this film I was taken aback by the high IMDb rating of an 8.1 and on the statistics most people were rating this a nine or a ten. Well I'm pleased to say the hype has been more than justified and this is almost as brilliant as Limitless.Without going into a synopsis as other reviewers will undoubtedly do anyway, the idea of alternate realities (Quantum theory) and going back to a point in time, more specifically for eight minutes is an interesting premise (all this due to the programme Source Code). It explores the premise to some extent, but where this film mainly succeeds is not in the science, (which was a bit confusing and not entirely credible) is in fact the acting and the characters, Jake Gyllenhaal as Colter Stevens gives a great performance and is always convincing throughout the movie. Michelle Monaghan as Cristina Warren I think was a bit underwritten but she humanises the whole movie with a touching, charming and believable performance and is the movies biggest asset. Gyllenhaal and Monaghan in their roles because of their believable performances makes you emotionally connect with them as characters and come to care about what happens to them as they also have a lovely chemistry on screen. They are helped by a script which was well written and sharp. I was also taken with the cinematography of the 'source code' universe, which was beautiful to look at, the special effects were also superb as well. There was plenty of suspense and tension throughout as well and it kept me watching to the end. Speaking of the end I have to say I was a bit disappointed. Don't get me wrong your glad for Cristina and Colter and I am all for happy endings, but it just felt conveniently added on to me and there was no explanation at all of how it came to be as it was with the simulation of only eight minutes becoming a reality universe. So you are left with a big question, which ultimately left me feeling a bit incomplete. Saying that Source Code more than entertained me and it's nice to see a sci-fi movie that dosen't just care about the action but the characters as well, which gives it heart. Definitely worth going to see.",9,1,5,1 April 2011
Skyfall," The Best Bond Movie Ever?
","Usually my review titles refer to how I feel about the movie. With the case of a Bond movie I would normally use phrases such as 'Bond is Back!' or 'The Best Bond Movie in Years!' etc. However this time I have decided against it and chosen to indulge in a perspective of a highly debatable nature. Is, on the 50th anniversary of James Bond, Skyfall the best Bond movie ever conceived? A lot of fans of 007 would say yes, that it far surpasses all the previous ones including the true classics, Goldfinger being one example, whilst others would surmise it is one of the best. Me personally I would argue the former for several reasons. For a start the plot is refreshingly different from all the others, which would normally consist of some plot for world domination, but this time it is much more personal with revenge against MI6, more specifically M, with instead of Bond pursuing the villain, it's the other way round. Taking the foundation of the Bond formula for a narrative and twisting it on its head offers the audience the notion that the Bond franchise can still deliver surprises and make the process feel refreshed and offers a whole new consistent level of interesting. The last two Bond movies with Daniel Craig Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace tried that, but on the individualistic level of the core of Bond's character by making him more humanistic and vulnerable, with more prone to serious injury both physically (when he is poisoned by Le Chiffre) and mentally when he loses Vesper who he was in love with. They also moved away from Bond's reliance on gadgets as well. The whole new spin on the tone of the franchise with Bond's quippy one liners and glitzy gadgets was both a triumph and failure. But Skyfall successfully blends the two beautifully with the return of Q and Moneypenny (played by new actors of course) and a certain old car. Secondly Skyfall manages to skilfully combine the old suaveness, British patriotism that drives Bond to do his duty with his quippy one liners, whilst maintaining his more humanistic characteristics as we learn more than any other Bond movie combined about his childhood. This makes his character more compelling and attractive than ever with the Bond mystique about his world irresistible to immerse oneself in. In particular the relationship he has with M is keenly felt in this film as though she is the mother Bond never had. This is elevated by the brilliant performances Dame Judi Dench and Daniel Craig deliver with an assemblage of a top-supporting cast that turn in all exquisitely proportioned performances no matter their length of screen time. Craig's acting as Bond in Skyfall solidifies him as the potential to be one of the best Bonds in the 50 years franchise, whilst Dench delivers what can only be described as another first class performance in her prosperous acting career. Both do not deserve to be overlooked come this Oscar season. Javier Bardem as villain Silva is sensational as he is funny, weird and horrific all at the same time. Though his screen time is limited, every nuance, word and sentence carried weight and he shows himself to be a true adversary worthy for Bond. There are also great supporting performances from Ralph Fiennes, Albert Finney, Ben Winshaw (terrific as the new Q) and Naomie Harris as Eve. What also helps with the excellent performances is the exquisitely written screenplay by Purvis, Wade and London, which is high on topicality (cyber-terrorism, which gives Bond a much needed update), wit and intelligence. This includes some great character development for Bond and a couple of ingenious twists, which I didn't see coming. Cinematographer Roger Deakins does a wonderful job with capturing the feel with the locations of London, Shanghai and Scotland. Credit must also go to music composer Thomas Newman who's score throughout is perfectly atmospheric as he cleverly plays on the old Bond music themes, whilst adding some nice new ones of his own. Director Sam Mendes directs with an ease and confidence as though he has done an action movie before (he hasn't, but he should after this and direct the next Bond movie!). He gives us some heart-stopping stunts and brilliantly staged action sequences that are some of the very best I've seen in any action movie. There are far more acting scenes than usual in a Bond movie, but it doesn't makes the two hour, twenty minute run time seem dragged out. If anything it makes other action adventures feel amateurish by comparison. In the end Mendes and cast and crew have collated together to bring us the best Bond movie since it's inception 50 years ago. Obviously not everyone will think this. By all means do go and see it and make up your own mind. But mostly every Bond/action fan will enjoy something from this movie. There is no doubt in my mind this should receive Oscars. It would be criminal if it didn't. And thanks to a marvellous undertaking by everyone involved in this film, the Bond franchise is assured to continue for years to come. The best Bond and one of the best action adventures I've ever seen. I loved every minute of it. Happy 50th anniversary Bond!",10,4,24,2 November 2012
Iron Man 3," Iron Man 3 manages to drag the franchise out of the mud after it's inferior predecessor and revitalises it to be the best one yet.
","After the watchable enough, but disappointing Iron Man sequel, this third one in the franchise had a lot to live up and to revert my opinion on the franchise, which had hit a rough patch. My expectations were exceedingly low, even with the good reviews. However in a way that worked massively to the film's advantage and after 130 minutes I came out convinced that I had just seen one of the best third films of any franchise (whatever the genre, I shudder at the number 3 sometimes with movies like Rush Hour 3, Spiderman 3 and Shrek The Third) and the greatest Iron Man up to date.One asset of the franchise, which has never failed in all three movies is it's most bankable star Robert Downey Jr (who is just a fantastic actor in any film) who always plays the part with a smarmy, sarcastic twinkle in his eyes with the undercurrent notion of a man burdened by so much, which is certainly the case in the third film.Set after The Avengers Assemble movie (nicely referenced throughout the movie) Stark is struggling with day to day life, staying up for days at a time, (by throwing himself into his work) and struggling to sleep and having nightmares of what Loki did. We also see him suffer anxiety attacks. He is also pushing away his girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow - who gets a meatier role in this and more to do instead of being the typical damsel in distress). But a threat to America from the fearsome adversary The Mandarin (Ben Kinglsey) aided by Killian (Guy Pearce) forces Stark to pick himself up and protect the people and everyone he loves. Throughout he is supported by his friend Rhodes (Don Cheadle) and when Iron Man crashes in the snow aided by a kid Harley Keener (TY Simpkins - there's always a kid isn't there!?) The cast give wonderful performances, with Downey Jr obviously being the best one with his flippant attitude and witty wisecracks (thanks to a well observed script by Shane Black whose credits include Lethal Weapon). Paltrow gives her best performance yet and humanises the whole film with her worry for Stark and her best moment comes at the end where she becomes all bad-ass and then comes up with the best one liner after the carnage she causes (I won't tell you, you'll have to see if for yourself). Kingsley and Pearce gives terrific performances as the bad guys, with a nice, unexpected twist with The Mandarin, though some other reviewers say they feel cheated and it brunts the impact felt of The Mandarin being a fearsome adversary for Iron Man (which is fair enough as everyone has their own interpretations). I have to disagree and if anything for me it elevated his mystique. Downey Jr works wonderfully with Cheadle and the kid Simpkins as they have great buddy chemistry as those two gives solid performances.Though Iron Man 3 may start off a bit slow and not have as much action as it's predecessor, on balance I prefer as it builds up the story and the character development (of Stark), which is rare in a third movie. It takes the time to not just wow us with the great special effects and exciting action sequences (the best being the last sequence at the docks), but also get to know and care about the new characters and the old ones too. The music was also great and the cameo right at the end of the credits by a certain actor (no not Robert Downey Jr) from The Avengers movie was brilliant.The only criticism I have for Iron Man 3 is the 3D, which was awful. Very little of it is in 3D and was just a wasted gimmick that was not necessary for an already great film. Overall Iron Man 3 for me elevates the franchise to a whole new level and becomes the best of the lot. Not everyone will agree, but see it for yourself and make up your own mind.",9,3,8,4 May 2013
Kung Fu Panda," Mildly entertaining, but nothing more and ultimately boring.
","I never was taken much with Kung Fu Panda as with a lot of reviewers on here. Dreamworks have come up with some pretty impressive animations over the years though my favourites being Shrek 1 and 2. But the company just isn't in the same league as Pixar. Anyway Kung Fu Panda I found mildly enjoyable but ultimately unsatisfying. Don't get me wrong I chuckled at a few parts throughout and Jack Black puts in an incredible effort of bringing a lot of charm to Po. The cast is great including Black with Dustin Hoffman (Shifu), Angelina Jolie (Tigress), Jackie Chan (Monkey), Seth Rogen (Mantis) and Lucy Lui (Viper). They all lend good voice-overs to the characters and even the story was OK. But I couldn't connect with many of the characters, the fight sequences if you can call them that were choreographed surprisingly badly, the script wasn't sharp enough with the comedy as the jokes weren't all that funny and the animation wasn't as impressive as previous animations. Despite that though it's not the worst animation I've seen and it was at least trying to entertain you and the bottom line is kids will absolutely love it anyway. But it's not a movie I would care to watch again.",4,0,5,15 July 2011
Iron Man 2," A good trashy fun sequel, but quite disappointing on the whole
","I though the first Iron Man was really great, with a new idea and great story, superb action and great acting with enough in depth about the characters to make you care and give the story substance, but I'm afraid Iron Man 2 just falls into the typical sequel trap of just trashy fun wanting to cash in on the first. It is great fun. Downey Junior is still excellent as Stark and very funny. The action sequences were fun and the special effects were amazing. Not to mention there was some good music and Downey Jr gave the script in parts wit.But the script was mostly awful with thin characters. I could see the director Jon Favreau try to flesh them out but the multiple stories didn't work, which loses that in depth of the characters and why we care for them. He tries to do the multiple narrative like Sam Raimi in Spiderman 2 who successfully had the main story with there sub-plots that blended seamlessly together beautifully with the depth of the characters understanding the motivations behind there choices and decisions and making you care about them but Favreau fails in this respect. Micky Rourke dosen't make a lasting impression as villain Whiplash and Scarlet Johansson though pretty was extremely underused. There is not motivation for her character. Also there are some gaping plot holes like why when Whiplash escapes from prison is it not reported by the media? And he goes to the grand prix track to kill Stark whose one of the drivers but he didn't even know he was there because he arrives before he sees him and we're not made aware Whiplash knows he's there making the character and film a bit dumb and forfeiting credibility as a result. Saying that there was plenty of action sequences, which were done really well and were exciting to watch as a result. But on the flip side, it leaves too little room for story and character development (whereas Batman Begins and Spiderman 2 balanced out the action and story perfectly).Good trashy fun yes, which I enjoyed but it's not as amazing as people make out. I really was expecting much more and I was quite disappointed on the whole. This had potential and I could tell Favreau tries with the multi-plots but it just fails. This dosen't live up to the hype it's received but it's still worth seeing. I hope the third shows improvement.",5,11,24,2 May 2010
Rocky V," An underrated Rocky movie. As brilliant as 1 and 2 with Rocky for the moment going out in style.
","Only a 4.5 IMDb rating, I am shocked, Rocky V has been severely underrated. I thought this was as brilliant as Rocky I and II. Why I give this such a high rating is that Rocky V reverts to a similar formula of the first two of the story not just focusing on the boxing but the characters and that's what Rocky V does.The basic story continues after the fourth with Rocky (Stallone) coming home after his fight with the Russian boxer. He and his wife Adrian (Talia Shire) along with her brother Paulie (Burt Young) are greeted by the media when loudmouth George Washington Duke (Richard Gant) who is a boxing promoter comes along with his boxer to challenge Rocky to defend his title but he refuses as he announce to the media he is retiring. Things become bad for Rocky as he finds out he had irreversible brain damage if he continues to fight, it could kill him. They get even worse when Paulie makes an investment with Rocky's money with a crooked accountant and they lose everything like their house and they have to move back to Philadelphia where they move back into Pualie's house and Adrian gets her old job back at the pet shop part time. Meanwhile a young up and coming boxer Tommy 'machine gun' Gunn asks Rocky to be his coaching manager and eventually he agrees as the kid steadily rises through the ranks. Rocky spends all his time with Tommy therefore alienating his wife and particularly his son Rocky Junior (played by his real life son Sage Stallone). This develops a side story of his son starting school and going through a rebellious stage against his father. Later Tommy becomes frustrated with Rocky for not getting him fast enough up through the ranks to become the new heavyweight champion of the world so Duke who on several occasions tries to persuade Rocky to fight snatches Tommy who does win the title but is goaded by the public and media for not acknowledging Rocky's contribution to his win. Eventually after this Rocky and his son make up but Tommy wants to prove to the media and public who goad him about his easy win of the title that he is a true champion by challenging Rocky to a fight. He goes to where Rocky lives and they have a brutal street fight.Rocky V is fantastic. Stallone gives his best performance to date. And for the first time you feel a real bond between him and his son. This makes it more authentic by the fact that father and son are in real life. There are some touching moments between them and it's sad to see his son rebelling but understandable because of his fathers rejection. Sage Stallone gives a engaging performance showing he has a great future ahead of him. Talia Shire as Adrian is excellent in this as ever and has more screen time whilst Burgess Meredith as Rocky's recent deceased coach has a small cameo in a flashback which he is terrific in. It's nice to see him again. Tommy Morrison as Tommy Gunn perfectly captures his character of a young man hungry for opportunity to progress after a bad childhood being beaten by his drunk father with a hot head as he is manipulated by Duke for money and power. There is more of a story to this as the true bond of family between husband, wife and son is felt. Throughout the films we have seen Rocky and Adrian transform themselves into more outgoing people who love each other and who we have come to care about as we have been with them on that journey. The final fight is brutal but inspiring. The film gives out a great and encouraging message that even though Rocky may have lost his career. He never lost his family or his respect as when he defeats Tommy Gunn, people chant his name. And that's what truly matters. Rocky V has heart and it's sad that Rocky Balboa (2006) is the last one, which I have yet to see and know it will a fitting end to a great boxing legend and cinema character icon. Rocky as a franchise is one of the best and strongest I've ever seen and I will miss these characters. Rocky is a legend that will never be forgotten. I certainly won't forget.",9,6,8,9 September 2010
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Terrific trashy fun, just what the doctor ordered!
","I was in the mood for a big action trashy fun blockbuster after studying hard and having exams and that's what Bruckheimer and Mike Newell delivered. Yes the story may have been weak with a bit of a dry and predictable script, but even in places it was surprisingly witty, this was due to the great romantic chemistry between Jake Gyllenhall and Gemma Arterton with witty banter that made it enjoyable. There was much more chemistry than between Arterton and Worthington in the Clash of the Titans. Newell I have to say in such a trashy fun Hollywood blockbuster, the romance is usually cheesy and pushed aside and I'm glad he instructed the script writers to put more witty banter in the dialogue, it worked.I have to say I was also impressed with Gyllenhal's performance as Prince Dastan and he had not only the acting but physicality to pull off some amazing stunts, which were his own and I thought Arterton as Princess Tamina was surprisingly good (after her dismal performance in Clash of the Titans). She actually put effort into her voice. She has been criticised for her performance as some critics have stated that her acting is just as bad in the Titans, but I'm afraid they are at fault for misinterpreting, she deserves praise and looked pretty.Ben Kingsley though as villain Nizam was excellent and stole the show for best performance whilst Alfred Molina (whom I didn't even recognise!) was superb as an ostrich racing money maker, he was hilarious. The special effects were stunning, the scenery was lovely and the action was exciting and plenty with inventive editing techniques and camera shots. This was terrific fun and it really made my day and is certainly better then Clash of the Titans. Keep your expectations low and you will have a blast.",8,3,11,25 May 2010
Spider-Man 2," Spider-sequel-tastic
","My presumptions of a sequel to a successful original are that they are worn out and are a desperate attempt to cash in on it's predecessor. Look no further for conclusive evidence with the terrible Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen to know what I'm talking about.But every now and again a sequel comes along that just simply changes your perceptions and gives you faith in a continuing franchise where the sequel is just as or in the case of Spiderman 2 better than it's predecessor.Toby Maquire, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco return with director Sam Raimi who has done a terrific job in making this for me one of the best sequels of all time.One of the successes Spiderman 2 has is the depth of the characters and stories as there is more than one strand. Toby Maquire has the same natural ability which he possessed in the first film to accurately convey the character of Peter Parker who struggles with his feelings for Mary Jane who becomes frustrated that he can't return her feelings for him, to his fractured friendship with Harry Osborne who harbours a deep grudge against Spiderman to trying to balance his life as superhero, student and employee and struggling with his Aunt May over Uncle Ben's death to finally battling the new villain Oto Octavious played memorably by Alfred Molina and all these story strands thread there way through two hours of pure entertainment.With the main story and these sub-stories the film could have become confusing and meaningless but thanks to the sublime artistry from Sam Raimi, it flows beautifully and never loses sight of itself.Which goes to say the acting is as brilliant from the main cast which helps the film has more exploration and depth and the special effects this time round are flawless and much improved on the first.This has everything for the comic fans and those who just want to be entertained of action (which there is plenty of particularly towards the end) drama, romance and humour mostly from JK Simmons who when he was on screen I was laughing out loud.Credit goes to all involved and I very much look forward to Spiderman 3.",10,27,36,29 September 2009
127 Hours," A truly captivating and forever memorable story about the human will to survive.
","Danny Boyle's very good film Slumdog Millionaire scooped eight Oscars. 127 Hours his follow up has been nominated for 3 Golden Globes and already eighteen other nomination categories, which includes Best Leading Man, James Franco. Frankly 127 Hours deserves a handful of these. This movie grabbed my attention straight away, from the first shot. Throughout we see the camera split in two screens, hand-held, documentary style like camera and conventional shooting. The first minute shows a marvellous split screen montage, which is then split into three as we are introduced to James Franco's character based on a true story Aron Ralston who whilst hiking and climbing in the canyons of Utah comes across two pretty female hikers Kristi (Kate Mara) and Megan (Amber Tamblyn) who are lost, he helps them find their way and they find out is a cocky, daredevil free type guy who likes to have fun when they jump into a large pool from climbing in between two walls that opens into a large cave face. I felt the rush and adrenaline as he and the girls jumped into the pool as though I was actually there and that's what makes this thing even more authentic with the way it was shot and the fact it is based on a true story.Eventually though he leaves them to do his own thing but falls down a small canyon and gets his right arm stuck between the wall and large rock. This happens about twenty minutes in and from the look in Aron's eyes it's clear he never faced this sort of helplessness before. From here we really get inside the character's head as he tries desperately to escape trying several methods, whilst at the same time trying to survive on little food and water as he talks into his video-camera about how he feels as he begins to hallucinate as his situation deteriorates rapidly over the five days he is stuck there. From being trapped Aron starts to realise his selfishness at how he has lived his life and treated other people like not keeping in contact with his parents, by taking them for granted and his unwillingness to commit. All these are told in flashbacks. Also wisely throughout Aron's ordeal Boyle has added a few moments of bleak humour that lightens the mood slightly and gives the film a better balance.127 Hours is truly a film that perfectly captures the human spirit and will to survive as we see Aron desperately trying to escape his predicament. We the audience are fully versed to Aron's fear and regrets, as I felt whilst watching it, the fact I sometimes take my family for granted and for a movie to do that, make the viewer pause and reflect on themselves is not something that is easily done, which makes the film all the more clever for it. Not only that you are tuned to the notion of coming to care about him and want him to get out as I related to him, you can place yourself in his shoes imagining yourself in a similar situation. The stylish camera-work helps reinforce that but so does James Franco's performance, I quite like him in the Spiderman films, but this was more real-life, serious drama and a role that challengingly flexed him and he worked up to it, with a performance of his life. It was tremendous and he has already been nominated for an award, which is richly deserved. As to far as the amputation scene, it is very brutal, yes and if you are squeamish of blood I wouldn't recommend it but the full impact is shortened in the film so it isn't as shocking as it seems and I have seen worse. 127 Hours though I can recommend fully for those who want to find a simple but incredibly fascinating true story of character. I saw my first film of the year last week, which was The Next Three Days with Russell Crowe, which was excellent, but this was even better. This film is serious contender for best film of 2011 so far, but there are still eleven months to go so we'll see. Let's hope 2011 for terrific films continues. 127 Hours truly is one of the most memorable films I have ever seen and I can't give it higher praise than that.",10,1,5,10 January 2011
Spider-Man 3," One big mess - Overlong and over-plotted.
","When I saw the first Spiderman back in 2002 I thought it was brilliant and that Sam Raimi had superbly conveyed the superhero successfully to the big screen.Then two years later Spiderman 2 came out and it was even better, with more strands of plot included, but it was tightly packed and the film showed real depth and exploration of the characters emotions with the various stock situations that were taking place.With Spiderman 2 being so flawless I had extremely high expectations for the third and I have to say I was quite disappointed. But first the positives of this film and one thing that cannot be criticised is the special effects of the suits namely Spidey's and the dark suit and when Sandman changes from dust to figure is awesome to look at making the CGI improved from the second.The acting from the big three, Magurie, Dunst and Franco is as good as it ever was with the additional support in particular Thomas Church as Sandman was great and the action sequences were exciting, which made it entertaining but unfortunately that is all I could pull that I liked from this film.Unfortunately the rest of the film and the problem mainly being the plot, it was just too long and too much included.For example we not only get Sandman and Venom but the return of the Green Goblin and Spidey's dark side coming out and to add Peters relationship with Mary Jane is under threat.The movie crumbles under it's own weight with so many plot lines. I found the stories difficult to follow and instead of flowing naturally like the second, which if you remember had one main story and a few sub-plots, it felt clichéd.For example when the Harry bumps his head during his fight with Peter and gets amnesia just felt ridiculous. Not to mention that fight sequence was edited too fast. I felt dizzy when watching it.But the core problem of the plot was it lacked the emotional involvement of the characters as everything happens so quickly because there is so much to include.What's also gone is the humour that helped make the first two more humanistic and made that character development go a bit further.This made me feel as though the film was just going through the motions.Another criticism is parts of the acting, Maguire for example when he came out with his dark side, his attempt at portraying a villain was pathetically foolish and Dunst became irritating with her character MJ moaning all the time.Some of the other scenes like when Harry finds out his father killed himself from his servant Bernard who (if you can remember him) was a very minor character in the first two tells him that, but how would he know? You hardly ever saw him.In the end to put it simply Raimi tried to be too clever by including more than he should have and we have been left with a film that is one big mess.I would suggest he should have just had the Green Goblin and Sandman for this film as the dark suit and Venom link, which could have been left to the next film.It was still entertaining and I recommend you see it, but be prepared to be disappointed as this isn't spectacular. Lets hope this is just a glitch is what has been a superb franchise and that Spiderman 4 will be much improved.",6,0,2,2 October 2009
The Expendables," Even the action hero greats can't save this crap.
","The Expendables trailer advertised specifically what it was meant to in the movie. Just trashy fun with lots of explosions and a hot woman. With total disregards to story and character development and even a cheesy script I wouldn't have minded as certain actors in films most notably Jason Patric as the main villain who was entertaining in The Losers and The A-Team film with Liam Nesson and Sharlto Copley etc hamming it up and taking the script for what it was.Now some people have said that other reviewers don't get this movie and that it advertises honestly what it says on the tin, action oh yes that is all well and good but it's impossible to enjoy the action if the camera angles change so quickly as the editing is so frenetic with the camera constantly jerking up and down so much so all I saw was things and people flying across the screen not knowing who or what it was coming from which direction. For example the scene at the start where Jet Li, Stallone and Statham are standing on the deck of the ship looking down at the bad guys. Then suddenly they're standing on level with them even though the drop is fifty feet. Now one assumes as they are ex military, that they climbed down using ropes but we never saw them get it out, so it's as though they just jumped down and didn't injure themselves. Such an amendment in the script of adding a simple prop to enhance realism makes this film reek of laziness. Another scene is when Stallone and Li are in a grey pick up truck being chased. One minute they are ahead of the red truck, which contains more bad guys shooting at them and then next the red truck is in front. Presumably it drove past but the camera switches and turns so quickly and constantly it's impossible to keep track of anything happening on screen. so it's as though by magic it disappeared and reappeared like a magic trick. Unfortunately Stallone seems to have developed the annoying trait of Michael Bay of not being able to shoot an action scene (just watch the terrible Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen to know what I'm getting at). I could go on with several other examples but I think you get the point.Mentioning earlier of the failure to add a simple prop of a rope to show how the leads jumped from the deck of a ship to the bottom. The script is of course awful and unimaginative and yes it is cheesy though, but it contains little laughs. The only scene I did like was with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis which was funny but too short. Stallone apparently drafted the script hundred times before he settled for the one to put into production. I hate to imagine what the first ninety nine were like. In terms of the characters, yes they are cardboard with no depth to them but they never come to life, not like in The A-Team where they actors look like they are enjoying themselves and as a result the audience enjoy it more too. This had the opposite but inevitable effect, the actors looked bored so do we and don't even get me started with the acting. Stallone just mumbles his lines and on some extreme close up shots looks more and more like his mother (and I don't mean that as a compliment). He just looked grizzled and washed out and maybe a sure sign it's about time he retired from acting and directing. Jet Li and Jason Statham don't figure any better and Micky Rourke is at his worst again from Iron Man 2. The only actors I did like were Bruce Willis and Arnie. But they were only in that one scene for about a minute so why did they get advertised as having main parts in the movie? It's beyond me. Now as I said there are a few good moments with the comedy scene in the church and even I did enjoy one fight scene where Statham beat up some guys in the park, but really this was just boring, unimaginative tripe with even the violence being tasteless. All I really did enjoy was the fact I didn't pay to see this (though I certainly wasted my time) and when I walked out when the film ended. Do yourself a favour and see another action film like Salt or the ones I mentioned The Losers or The A-Team, they are much better, not this overblown and overrated trash, a 7.1 on the IMDb ratings! What a joke! Unfortunately alas it's not. This is one movie I won't watch again. The only place it belongs is in the garbage.",1,5,13,10 September 2010
Final Destination 2," Very enjoyable but not a patch on the original.
","FD 2 gets new director David Ellis and the story is literally the same as the first one where a teenage girl called Kimberly is on a road-trip to Daytona with 3 friends but on the highway she has a premonition of a massive pile up. Cue comes she freaks out and everyone who cheats death is put on a new list.Ali Larter's character Clear Rivers is revived from the first one and is first found at the Stony Brook institution as the only survivor as Alex from the first dies between films (a brick dislodged itself from a building and hit him in the head) Kimberley asks for Clears help as she is still on death's list.The story is nothing new though there is a connection with the people on the new list to the first one, which I liked. The deaths are still inventive and gruesome and the acting is still to a good standard. Ali Larter is the best actress of the film whilst Tony Todd the mortician from the first one reprises his role in one scene which he makes the most of and Kimberly played by A.J Cook isn't bad either.This isn't a patch on the original as it's not really scary but you do feel for the characters still to some extent particularly Clear. The music is also good.It's a very enjoyable hour and a half and is a very good sequel to it's predecessor. I recommend a watch if you liked the first one or are a horror fan.",7,2,2,11 April 2010
The Town," Ben Affleck triumphs in his second directing debut. A terrific heist movie mostly all round
","Ben Affleck made his first directing debut with Gone Baby Gone in 2007, which is rumoured to be fantastic as I haven't seen it. If that is the case and after watching The Town. It looks more like the case. Ben Affleck has always been a pretty solid actor but never one to get my guns blazing in my book, which just goes to show his real talent lies in directing.The Town is set in Charlestown, USA where a group of men led by Douglas MacRay (Ben Affleck) including his best friend James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner from The Hurt Locker) for a living, storm armoured cars and rob banks for money. One bank they rob, they end up taking a hostage of pretty bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall). Meanwhile the FBI including the head of the investigation Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) has been after Doug and his men for years and is determined to bring them down. Things become complicated for Doug when he falls for Claire and they embark on a romance. Will she find out the truth? As he also has to deal with his boss Fergus, a drug lord who poses as a florist (Pete Postelthwaite).Iniatally some of the weaknesses of this movie that stopped me giving this higher than an 8 is the formulaic script that needed a lot more work and the over familiar story. But the action heist sequences are top notch and manage to create suspense and tension and are exciting to watch due to some terrific stunt driving and being exquisitely shot and edited to perfection by Affleck. He has a keen eye when it comes to these scenes, but he also manages to pull out excellent performances from his cast all round, which refreshes the over-familiar plot. Affleck himself gives a reasonable performance of a man torn between his life, friend and the woman he cares about. Jeremy Renner gives a solid supporting performance, whilst Postelthwaite is memorably creepy as Fergus and Blake Lively as tarty mum Krista who has the hots for Doug perfectly portrays a woman constantly high on drugs but feels trapped by the life she leads and wants to escape but can't or won't. The two strongest performances though come from Jon Hamm as FBI Crawley, who gets some terrific one liners, but is determined to catch Doug and Rebbeca Hall as Claire who is warm and intelligent and makes you feel for her predicament. What is surprisingly elitist about the film is from a basic script the actors manage to turn the dialogue into something more meaningful and heartfelt, which is a incredible accomplishment. The cinematography is brilliant of the town being hard, gritty and realistic and the violence itself is handled maturely, where it is never glamorised but shown in all it's brutality. The music is superb and there are some clever disguises when they pull off the bank heists and a few moments of laughter particularly when Doug and the others have the masks of nuns and after pulling off an armoured heist, they get out of the car with the money and automatic weapons and a cop sitting in a car in the next lane sees them. They stare at each other and then he looks away was funny. The romance between Doug and Claire, though I never believed they were in love and there isn't as much romantic chemistry between them. They care about each other and the two actors are comfortable enough on screen to make us think that. But also it's more of a romance of need almost, where Claire is fractured emotionally after her hostage experience and Doug who wants to get out of the life he leads. They are like two lost souls, parts missing from each other and when they meet they are whole.One other surprising aspect, which makes this film refreshing is the ending, which keeps you guessing. Will Doug gets away from the police with Claire at his side? Well watch The Town and find out for yourself. This is a great movie all round and is better than average thanks to superb directing, acting and suspenseful bank heists. Thanks to Affleck (and lets hope he directs more films and that they are just as good). This town is well worth visiting and a film that is worth your own time to see.",8,3,8,29 September 2010
Shutter Island," A masterpiece. A conspiracy and psychological thriller that will have you hooked.
","Shutter Island for me is the years best film so far. Leonardo Decaprio gives an outstanding performance as US Marshall Teddy Daniels set in 1954. Him and his partner Chuck Aule played excellently by Mark Ruffalo are on their way to Shutter Island, a closed off psychiatric prison for the criminally insane. Teddy and Chuck have been set to investigate the disappearance of a female prisoner who has escaped though the guards or doctors don't know how she escaped from the room. Arriving at the prison Scorsese sets up the tone of a dark, disturbing and mysterious place using non-diegetic sound and a haunting music score (one of the scariest I have heard) to deliberately unsettle us and it dosen't help when Teddy and Chuck have to surrender their firearms at the main gate. As Teddy and Chuck investigate the prisoner's disappearance their investigation leads them to believe there may be a sixty seventh (being only sixty sixth) in the first place. He begins to believe that the doctors and guards are conspiring in a conspiracy when they prove less than co-operative particularly the head doctor Crawley a superb part played by Ben Kingsley.Meanwhile as the investigation progresses Teddy and Chuck are shut off from the mainland due to a thunderstorm and Teddy has disturbing dreams of his dead wife and seeing images of dead children, which leaves him on a short fuse as also he is a recovering alcoholic. As the film progresses things get stranger and you know something is going on. This is fantastically told film with a complex plot (and a twist in the last half hour that shocked me to the core) superb acting and intelligent dialogue and script. Decaprio has been severely criticised by some for his acting but this is the best performance I have ever seen him give (even better than in Titanic) and he deserves at least an Oscar nomination. Shutter Island is an intriguing and complex thriller that will keep you guessing to the end with excellently acting and making. This is a masterpiece and will remain if the not the best then one of the best movies of the year and ever. If you like intellectual stimulation or a challenging mystery. I implore you to see this. Outstanding.",10,2,5,23 April 2010
Rocky II," An excellent sequel to the enthralling original. Rocky punch blasts his way through this.
","Rocky II I had the ultimate pleasure of viewing yesterday and I am pleased to say this was as excellent and exciting as the first one. This second part continues the story from the first one after Rocky's thrilling fight with Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers). It starts off with Rocky (Stallone) and Creed at hospital where Creed demands a rematch as his fans think the fight was fixed and that Creed has bought shame to his fans as he is sent hate-mail (later on in the movie), but Rocky refuses and his then girlfriend Adrian (Talia Shire) is relieved as Rocky refuses to continue his boxing. With the money he wins from fighting with Creed he and Adrian get married, get a new house, car and she falls pregnant but eventually Rocky ends up losing everything as he loses a contract to do a bunch of commercials and a job in the meat factory which he gets temporary. Meanwhile Creed demands a rematch to prove he can beat Rocky as he believes he was lucky as most people saw it as a draw or that Balboa was the winner. Eventually he agrees.The story is different which makes it refreshing and it's a comfortable continuation of the story of Rocky and his wife. Stallone and Shire provide great performances and there are a couple of surprisingly touching moments. Even though when they get married it's a bit cheesy, it's sweet and cute in a way. Burt Young as Adrian's brother provides good support, but Burgess Meredith as Micky his coach gives an excellent performance pushing Rocky in his training to encourage him. The script is still formulaic from the first one, but it works and even though the character development of the main character's past dosen't go further, you still care about them.This brings me onto the rematch between Rocky and Creed. It is brilliant. A very tense and atmospheric rematch, which gave me a buzz and had me cheering for Rocky. For me this fight was better than the first. I just got so caught up in it. This is a fantastic sequel and in the end I had a tear in my eye for happiness for Rocky as he wins. You end up rooting for him hugely in this. I now look forward to the third with more high expectations, which I will give my review on soon. Rocky rules!",9,0,2,7 September 2010
Captain America: The First Avenger," Entertaining superhero movie but it never reached it's full potential, with a few major flaws.
","Captain America: The First Avenger is a superhero movie I was quite looking forward to. But in the end I came out quite disappointed with a movie though entertaining is completely forgettable and didn't reach the real potential it could have with a few major flaws.First though a brief synopsis with the character Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) being deemed unfit for military service, Steve volunteers for a top secret research project that turns him into Captain America, a superhero dedicated to defending America's ideals during WWII. He is aided in stopping a Nazi villain Johann Schmidt/Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) who wants to destroy the world. America is helped in stopping Schmidt by Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell),James Buchanan 'Bucky' Barne (Sebastian Stan) Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) and Howard Stark (yes father of Tony Stark from Iron Man).The first hour of the film was the best and most enjoyable with the main characters set up nicely as it was quite interesting. The script though basic did have flashes of wit with some cheesy, but fun comedy. But after an hour and at least eighty minutes into the film just ran out of steam (as another reviewer on here has rightly put it) and I just wanted the film to end. At almost two hours, it was too long. The CGI was impressive, some of the acting was great, mainly Hugo Weaving as Red Scar and I enjoyed Tommy Lee Jones's performance as Colonel Phillips, but I found Hayley Atwell's acting to be mediocre, which is a shame as she showed a bit of spunk in one scene at the start where she punched a male solider in the face for trying to hit on her. Her character just petered out I guess. Chris Evans made a capable enough lead and he had a certain charisma on screen at certain points, which made him watchable. But he was really just boring (though not unlikeable) and quite bland like a lot of the film. He had no spark in him as though he only put in a half-hearted effort.But it wasn't entirely his fault. His character has little character development. Yes we know he wants to do his duty to his country and that is very admirable and be a solider. But an important question which could have been explored and one of the film's major flaws is why? What motivates him to become a solider and ultimately Captain America? This is where the film pales in the shade next to brilliant superhero movies like Batman Begins and Spiderman 1 and 2, where the audience understands why Peter Parker becomes Spiderman and Bruce Wayne becomes Batman, which gives the character more substance, makes them interesting and you can relate to them in some way making you care about them. Captain America dosen't do that. The action as well though enjoyable to an extent had nothing special with it like any great stunts etc. There also wasn't enough of it and felt incredibly rushed as though it just wanted to get to the next scene past the action to the talking. It felt very condensed. In the end though I think this was much better than Thor, Captain America has been overrated. And if they do another standalone sequel of this and when it comes to The Avengers joining of all the marvel comic book superheroes in 2012. They should get a different actor for the part of America as Chris Evans couldn't pull it off. This film entertained me, but it just wasn't enough and didn't do anything for me overall.",6,2,12,27 July 2011
The Bourne Ultimatum," The best of the Bourne series!
","The third instalment of the Bourne franchise the Bourne Ultimatum is the best of the three. Matt Damon returns and is excellent in his role which he has settled into gracefully.This time Bourne reaches to the heart of his past with operation Blackfrier more CIA secrets to uncover with again assassins on his tail. Joan Allen returns once again in the only one who believes in Bourne and who is still on impressive form. The action sequences are even more exciting in this with director Paul Greengrass using the same Blair Witch Project style camera-work, which authenticates the sequences and builds up the tension.The stunts are even more incredible with Damon doing most of them and the fight scenes choreographed superbly.This is similar to the second but with acting, action and stunts even better makes this the best out of the three and the story which is still interesting as it is drawn to it's conclusion. It's a excellent spy film. James Bond? Never heard of him.",9,1,3,27 December 2009
The Bourne Identity," A decent effort but it fails to impress enough
","I knew nothing of the the Bourne books written by Robert Ludlum, but I like spy thrillers and thought it would be worth a look and I have to say I was quite disappointed. It starts intriguing with a man called Jason Bourne found shot on a fishing boat way out to see who wakes knowing nothing about himself, his name or past life and ends up being pursued by assassins as he tries to find out about himself.Overall the story of the film is quite complicated to understand and may need re seeing twice but even then you like me may lose your interest in anything that's going on. Another criticism is that there is too much plot with very little action attached throughout. The movie as a whole becomes long winded particularly clocking at two hours.Matt Damon as Bourne I'm afraid fails to impress. He seems far too normal with the situation he's in. There are not many emotive qualities to attach in particular when he falls for Maria played by Franka Potente. There relationship fails to convince really and the aura of Damon being physically diminutive makes him unconvincing as an assassin hired by the CIA.However the supporting cast like Clive Owen as a hit-man and Brian Cox,Chris Cooper and Juila Stiles as CIA operatives make the most of there roles. The action what there was entertaining, it was well shot and to be fair the film is just setting up the story for the next two parts which I fear though will be equally disappointing. It's a decent effort on the whole but it just wasn't good enough.",4,1,4,27 December 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," 'Lord of the rings' yes but this film should also be called 'Lord of the film industry'
","I first got into Lord of the Rings through my older sister who is a big fan of the books and films. She gave me The Hobbit, which is about Bilbo Baggins and his wizard friend Gandalf the Grey. Before reading this book I had never heard of J.R.R Tolkien so I wasn't sure what to expect, sufficed to say I thought the book was really good, quite a bit on the detailed side in terms of characters and the environment, which made for me the book waffling on a bit, but still really enjoyable nonetheless. Then my sister introduced me to Lord of the Rings and I read the first one before the film came out. I didn't like it. For me like The Hobbit it was just too detailed and kept trailing of the main plot of the story and eventually I put it down. But I felt guilty I was wanted to get into it so I decided to go back to it but instead like the first time reading it all through at once, which I do with books. I read it in shorter instalments to stop myself getting bored quickly and managed to finish it and sufficed to say I enjoyed it.With Tolkien for me once I read it I viewed his notion to express the deep detail of Middle Earth geographically and all the characters, there experiences and habits differently I realised this book was rich in detail, intellect and character development and without this extra part the book wouldn't have been half as enjoyable like when Gandalf falls across the bridge of Khazadum in Moria. I felt sad because in the book his character has been built up as person who cares about others and is gentle in nature but fiercely protects those he loves like Frodo. When the film came out I had never heard of Peter Jackson as director and went to the screening of Lord of the Rings quite apprehensive that Jackson couldn't pull it off. I sat down and from the beginning I was absolutely enraptured and two hours and forty five minutes the length of this film flew by. To say this is an incredible accomplishment is a lie. The Fellowship of the Ring rightly scooped four Oscars though it should have received more. What makes this book to film adaption so successful is Jackson's love for being a fan of the books. He truly keeps faithful to Tolkien's book and though there are chunks missing. The themes of friendship, loyalty, courage and cultural diversity are all here and are all cleverly linked together and flow naturally throughout the film.Jackson also got the attention to detail of the environment perfectly. Filming this in New Zeeland with it's glorious landscape, mountains and forests made me fall in love with the country. Jackson sweeps the camera across a wide arc when the characters are travelling but he never pans the camera too fast so the audience gets the whole visual spectacle and it is simply a breathtaking experience and worth the price of admission in itself.Other environments like The Shire, Rivendale and Moria all add texture to the rich detail of the film and are perfectly symmetrical to the characters emotions in the scene.The acting is also amazing. The bonds of friendship felt between the fellowship are easily apparent in particular between Frodo played superbly by Elijah Wood and Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen) is real and deeply felt. All the others actors and actresses are terrific including Sean Asrin as Samwise Gamgee, Merry Brandybuck (Dominic Monaghan) and Perrigrin Tock (Billy Boyd) elf witch Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) Gimli the Drawf played by John-Rhys-Davis who provides comic relief, Legalos the Elf (Orlando Bloom) Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) Boromir (Sean Bean) Lord Elrond (Hugo Weaving) Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm) the elf Arwen (Liv Tyler) and Sauraman (Christopher Lee) play all there characters with real understanding and depth and perfectly represent the essence and tone of the characters in the book.The special effects like digitally enhanced and CGI are equally stunning like the fire demon in Moria and the trolls making them seem real. Sufficed to say Jackson set himself a enormous task and has achieved it. There were no criticisms I could find for this film and everyone who took part no matter how small a contribution have to be commended.The action sequences are choreographed to perfection and the music is gorgeous to listen to which add the extra spark to the movie. This is grandeur on a massive scale and is terrifically entertaining. I implore you to see this. You will regret it if you don't. This is film in the making and Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring has for me surly become one of the best films of all time. But there are still parts two and three which I obsessively look forward to with manic glee. This film will go down as a classic movie of history, which people like me will want to see again and again. Try and stop me! A simply astounding film, which I can't praise highly enough. SEE IT!!!",10,0,1,23 October 2009
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," A fantastic start to the epic finale in the HP series. An almost perfect movie
","I am a die-hard Potter fan and have got and read all the books and seen all the movies made up until this point. After the good, but most disappointing of the Potter films, Half Blood Prince, I am very pleased to report Harry comes back in style thanks to terrific direction of the very capable David Yates and a mesmerising screenplay by Steve Knowles.In this first part of the Dealthy Hallows, Harry, Ron and Hermione are cut off for most of the film by the magical world as Voldemort has taken over the ministry of magic and Hogwarts as Dumbeldore has left Harry the task of finding and destroying the last of Voldemort's Horcruxes. Throughout we see the trio desperately frail about trying to decide what to do next. Throughout we get the sense of the desperation they feel with the whole wizarding world literally against them. Steve Knowles has done a sensational job of keeping as close to the novel as possible and it was lovely throughout as I could follow the sequence of events from the book and know roughly whereabouts the film was up to. The narrative structure of the story is held together extremely well as mostly everything is in there for the first part of the book. Obviously there were some parts missing, but it dosen't in any way degenerate the narrative structure too much.The biggest strength of this first part is the acting. Radcliffe, Grint and Watson have come a long way since the Philosopher's Stone and it shows, over the series they have explored their acting abilities and I am pleased to say this part one of the seventh film is their best acted yet. Grint provides much of the comedy element of the previous films, but also provides surprisingly in depth angst as he feels alienated from Harry and Herminone when they are camping in different parts of the UK and suspects they are a couple. Radcliffe gives an excellent leading performance as the Chosen One with the whole weight on his shoulders that is pushing him down and it shows, but Emma Waston is undoubtedly the best of the three. She has matured into a terrific adult actress. She radiates the screen with a touching and very believable performance. The supporting roles have to be mentioned, unfortunately Alan Rickman dosen't get enough screen time to flex out his role, but it was nice to see him anyway. Neither does Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid or David Thewlis as Lupin (a couple of parts he was in, which were cut out). Also Tom Felton as Draco dosen't get much at all or Timothy Spall as Wormtail. However those that get enough like Bill Nighy as Rufus Scrimgeour, Rhys Ifans as Xenophilius Lovegood, Evanna Lynch as Luna, Toby Jones as the voice of Dobby, Brenden Gleeson as Moody and Andy Linden as Mundungus Fletcher all make the most of their moments in terms of comedy like Flecther and the Weasley twins and the rest more serious. Special mention though has to go to Ralph Fiennes at his best as Voldemort he has a delightfully frightening menace. Jason Isacc's though he only appears twice is great as a father imprisoned by the Dark Lord and wants to please him. The dishevelled look of his appearance all but communicates it, but perhaps the best supporting performances are Helen Carter as the cackling mad Bellatrix Lestrange who is superb and a real delight is Imelda Staunton as Umbridge who plays her part to devilish effect and still has the great simpering laugh. You also get the notion of Harry, Ron and Hermione working together as a team, which was lost in the last film. The audience is very much attuned to the emotions of the three on their dark, lonely and disturbing journey, which is mostly full of sorrow and anger. But you get the sense they will never give up. Be warned though it is extremely dark and there are a few moments of terror, which may make you jump, though I didn't a few people around me in the cinema did. One moment I have to mention, which I particularly liked and was unexpected was the moment in the tent when Ron has left and Harry and Hermione get up to dance was very touching indeed. Other positives is the music is beautiful and depicts perfectly the emotions the trio go through on their journey, the cinematography of the dark and gloomy settings is gorgeous with excellent special effects as ever with a sharp script to go with it. The pace of the film never flags and there is some suspense and tension throughout, however this is where I feel the movie went slightly wrong.When it comes to the action there is little of it and it is apparent if you've read the book they cut parts out particularly the chase from when Harry leaves the Dursley's. Due to this restriction, you don't feel the full impact of emotions of what the characters are going through, which also loses some of the suspense and tension. This is why I stopped short of giving it a ten.However I won't put this down too much as it is still a stupendous achievement for Yates and the rest who have done a sensational job. The first part ends at a perfect place. This deserves to be a big hit and I cannot wait for part two next July, which I know will be even more amazing. If you are a Potter fan I don't think you will be disappointed. This is definitely worth the money and time to see and will bear re seeing many times. Thank you David for doing me and lots of others proud. Roll on part two!",9,0,2,19 November 2010
Kung Fu Panda 2," The power of awesomeness is abundant in this really fun sequel that is superior to its predecessor.
","I wasn't a big fan of the first Kung Fu Panda and found it ultimately boring though I described it as mildly entertaining. I was persuaded to give Kung Fu Panda 2 a try by my friend and to be honest I was willing to give it a go even though I was quite sceptical. But surprise and behold this was a really great sequel to the first, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I felt that much more effort was put into this and a result it is much more entertaining. The story itself was better with more in-depthness about Po's past, the animation was far better visually then the first one with the 3D being quite impressive. The action was choreographed better and more exciting to watch with the voice-over being great from the likes of Angelina Jolie, Dustin Hoffman, Gary Oldman (Shen), Jackie Chan and Seth Rogen. But Jack Black was the revelation as Po who bought even more charm to his character. However for me Gary Oldman as the voice of Shen the villain Peacock stole the film and was superb and made quite a menacing villain for a kids movie (plus funny too). Two revelations though that made this sequel a high rating as I gave it of a seven was the fact I came to care more about the characters in this, particularly Po and the fact the script was much wittier than the first with more comedy that was actually really funny at times. The best bit for me though being when Black says as Po as he holds his fist up. 'My fist hunger's for justice.' His stomach then rumbles for hunger and he pauses and says. 'That was my fist' had me in fits of laughter.I know I was quite critical of the first one, but I really enjoyed number two and this is a animation the whole family should enjoy. I would happily see this again for enjoyment and hope for the first time there will be a Kung Fu Panda 3. The Power of Awesomeness was completely lacking in number one but slams into drive for Kung Fu Panda 2.",7,0,1,15 July 2011
Knowing," Knowing was great....until the ending.
","So Nicholas Cage is back with the latest offering with a combination of a sci-fi, disaster and puzzle movie, mixing the likes of The Day After Tomorrow, The Da Vinci Code and Independence Day.This movie starts off very promising with a time capsule that is found buried, Cages son gets a piece of paper with just lots of random numbers on, but Cage works out that they show the times, dates and location of every major disaster in the last fifty years.Throughout we see Cage in a panic trying to work out when the next disaster will hit and at the same time trying to protect his son from a bunch of strange people who don't speak English, it turns out there aliens.All the way through I was on the edge of my seat with the story like what was happening? Who were these strangers hanging about Cage's son? What happens when the numbers on the paper ran out? There was plenty of excitement and tension and the acting was reasonable but then in the last twenty five minutes, the film just spiralled down here into lame superficial silliness. I was literally just sitting there and thinking 'oh right' The ending (not to ruin for anyone who still wants to see this) just didn't make any sense. How it ended just isn't explained and it felt like a massive let down. I was originally going to give this a nine or ten out of ten but I felt so let down I had to give it less.Other people I have spoken to about this film said the same thing. This was still a good movie and I enjoyed it, but it could have been spectacular which this wasn't.If you haven't seen this yet and want to be prepared to be disappointed.",6,0,2,17 October 2009
Hugo," An interesting and occasionally wonderful film from Scorsese, but it isn't for kids.
","Scorsese's attempts at making his first 'kids' movie is an admirable one. But the problem is the target demographics for Hugo has been misplaced. Very few young children under the age of ten are likely to enjoy this (though I'm sure there will be a few) because they maybe won't understand the story or wonder what is so interesting about the history of cinema. It just will not appeal to many. At first it does seem to be heading in a magical and mystical direction with the two kids Hugo (Asa Butterfield) and Isabelle (Chloe Moretz) who in the 1930s in Paris are trying to unlock the mystery of an automaton man who has a key shaped hole in his back. It does take a bit of time to build up to that moment and when it did I thought some sort of magical and fantasy world would open up, but it didn't. Not that I'm saying it wasn't interesting it certainly was; as in my first year at university I studied about the origins of cinema and I found the narrative fascinating in Hugo. To be fair there are certain elements of comedy and effects that may attract kids, but it won't be enough I think to keep their attention diverted for over two hours. Anyway on the whole for me the story was interesting and unfolded well, though I will be honest there were points at the beginning before the mystery of the automaton man was solved where I was getting bored as it did begin a bit too slowly. There were also other points in the structure of the narrative that tended to get bogged down in sub-plots, which though weren't boring, was not necessary for the film. Like the station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) lusting after the flower women Lisette (Emily Mortimer). At the risk of sounding so negative though there was plenty about the film that I really enjoyed. Apart from the great story, the acting was excellent across the whole terrific choice of cast. Newcomer Asa Butterfield gives a wonderful performance as Hugo capturing the essence of his character, an orphan who loved his father and has a joy in building and running the clocks in the station. This gives his character some depth as well. The scenes in particular played between him and his father (Jude Law who gives a great cameo) are quite heartwarming. Chloe Moretz again delivers an excellent performance, building on from her already promising acting career from films like Kick-Ass and Let Me In proving once again she is one of the best up and coming child actresses in Hollywood. Other members of the cast are equally mesmerising, Ben Kingsley as Georges Méliès probably gives the top performance of the movie as an old man working at a toy store in the station who feels haunted and sad after the end of his glorious film director career, but is transformed back to those days as Hugo and Isabelle solve the mystery. Cohen as the station inspector is surprisingly funny (given I'm not a fan of his more extreme comedy) and shows a vulnerable side with his leg injury from world war 1, which he overcomes with courage. Terrific cameos are also provided by Emily Mortimer, Christopher Lee and Richard Griffiths. With such great acting you do come to care about these characters as well and wish them all the best. The 3D is also truly spectacular and is used to magnificent effect particularly when it snows in the film, you actually feel like it's snowing in the cinema! It is the best 3D I have seen since the third Transformers movie. The cinematography and scenery are gorgeous visuals with some stunning views and the musical scores throughout are pitch perfect.In the end though Hugo does have it's flaws and I think the target demographics are slightly misleading. Everyone from teenage years and upwards should find something to enjoy, particularly film enthusiasts who are intrigued by the history of film. Hugo for me wasn't really magical, but it was interesting, touching and an occasionally wonderful spectacle. Scorsese deserves high merit for trying something out of his normal comfort zone and I commend him for that.",8,1,3,25 December 2011
Salt," Enjoyable summer action blockbuster with more than enough salt for the taste buds
","Angelina Jolie in the trailer speaking the line 'You think everyone is who they say they are' sets the premise surrounding the mystery of 'Who is Salt?' The basic story is that Jolie plays a CIA agent Evelyn Salt who is happily married to her husband a German arachnologist. During work she ends up talking to a Russian who accuses her of being a spy and her colleague Ted Winter (a part played superbly by the reliable Liev Schreiber) and Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor) have to track her down. Meanwhile her husband goes missing as she tries to find him. Salt is a terrific film in a lot of ways. Jolie carries the part well. Just like most of her other movies when they are action like Tombraider etc, she does all her own stunts which are terrific and add an air of authenticity to the film without the use of CGI. Her acting is good as she also looks great visually and in a few flashbacks of her character being with her husband, you feel the emotional connection of caring about them as I felt the love between them. The action sequences themselves were choreographed well and was exciting.One other aspect I will say is the choice of director Phillip Noyce of keeping the allegiance of Salt in the dark was refreshing and made me think what side she was on. This kept you guessing. I figured it out about halfway through, but it is challenging as there are an initial few twists and turns that happen fast so you might be thrown off balance in trying to figure out who she is. With the film keeping you guessing keeps up the suspense and tension of what Salt will or will not do next. Some reviewers have complained that it is impossible to root for any characters like Salt in the movie making you not care about them, but as I said I think it makes it challenging for you to figure and actually engages the viewer.As to far as the story a lot of people have poked plot holes in it. This may be true but to be honest with you I wasn't paying much attention. It seems to make sense to me, but maybe I'm not as smart as some people, but I really enjoyed it anyway for what it was.A lot of people have also said the ending is a cop out but I think it sets it up nicely for a sequel, like a continuation of her journey. I look forward to the sequel if there is one and hope there will be more depth to Salt as a character as I thought the film could have been extended by another five to ten minutes with maybe some more flashbacks of her character. However my taste buds are already tingling for a Salty, hopefully Saltier sequel.",8,2,8,24 August 2010
Rocky IV," An improvement on the third. Rocky gets brutal in this one as he shows he still packs the punch.
","The first twenty minutes of Rocky IV is interesting, which is mainly focused on his friend Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) who see a Russian champion boxer who is going to take part in a charity event. Creed wants to get back into the ring after five years but Rocky (Stallone) warns him not to but Creed insists so Rocky helps him. Cut to the fight where the Americans make a big spectacle of signing before the fight with Creed hamming it up for the crowd. Then the fight begins and it becomes brutal and Creed is killed in the ring. Rocky is devastated and wants revenge against the Russian boxer so he agrees to go to Russia to fight him where he trains with the help of Creed's old coach. And that's it really. This is even shorter than Rocky III only reaching an hour and a half. Stallone again gives a great performance as does Talia Shire as Adrian though she has little screen time, you can tell she loves her husband very much with supporting him. Also Burt Young as Paulie gets a few good comedy moments to do with a robot that is programmed to help him out.Carl Weathers returning the last time as Creed gives an entertaining performance with the time his on the screen, but I didn't think much of the Russian boxer. He dosen't say much and is quite boring though he is a fearsome adversary in terms of physically. There is a lovely montage of flashback when Rocky is driving his car with memories of his friendship with Creed and his own rise to fame with the brilliant song of 'Eye of the Tiger' What I liked about Rocky IV more than III is the fight felt more personal and as a result after growing fond of Apollo Creed in Rocky III and the blossoming friendship between them. I wanted Rocky to beat the Russian boxer and that inspired me in the fight, which made it better to watch. The fight is absolutely brutal but it also demonstrates the clear divide between East and West, Russia and America in the Cold War. Though Russia hate Rocky at first they soon cheer for him. In the end this fourth instalment was better than the third and even though these last two can't match Rocky's I and II, they are good enough and I look forward to Rocky V.",7,0,3,8 September 2010
Spider-Man," A new and exciting era for spider-man!
","A friend once said to me that characters from a book, comic or computer game cannot be made into a successful film.Based on the evidence of this film he is wrong.Spiderman has been faithfully adapted from the old worn down but classic comic books of the fifties and onto the big screen. And it is fantastic.Sam Raimi a director before this who I was not familiar with had made this a winner.The concept of the character and the surrounding story is spot on. Toby Maguire plays Peter Parker/Spiderman with real understanding. He conveys the right tone a being smart but awkward around the love of his life Mary Jane Watson but and has the wit and the looks to show heart.Support from James Franco and Kirsten Dunst as Harry and Mary Jane keeps the central storyline strong.Who ultimately steals the show is Willem Dafoe who plays the villain. The Green Goblin.He dominates the screen with his menacing fashion and a hilariously cackling laughter making the Goblin a fearsome adversary.And the whole thing is done with splat stick humour on the side, which helps the characters develop.The special effects such as the Spidey's suit and the Green Goblin is excellent against the backdrop of set.A couple of minor criticisms about the film, which stopped me giving it a ten was that some of the special effects were a bit cliché in places noticeably when Spiderman is flying and character development like with JK Simmons could have gone further.But pushing that aside. This is a highly entertaining superhero blockbuster that captures the tone and essence of the comics and what promises to be a new and exciting era for Spiderman!",9,0,1,18 September 2009
The Machinist," A superbly atmospheric and engaging film.
","The Machinist stars Christian Bale (playing the main lead excellently) who plays the character of Trevor Reznik, an exceptionally thin man, so much so you can see his skeleton who is plagued by fatigue after not having slept in more than a year. He works in a machine factory where one day he causes an accident one of his co-workers that leads him to losing his arm. They blame him for it and want him out of the job. Soon he starts to suspect they are conspiring against him when strange post it note messages appear on Trevor's fridge. whilst also he is haunted by a figure dressed in a black leather jacket and sunglasses called Ivan (played superbly by John Sharian). He tells Trevor he works in the factory but his co-workers and bosses claim he dosen't exist.Trevors quest to find out what is happening to him takes him into an interaction with other characters, Jennifer Jason Leigh who plays hooker Stevie with surprising heart in places, a waitress Maria at the airport who Trevor goes to for coffee and pie and her son. Is Trevor going mad in his investigation with not having slept in more than a year or is someone/people plotting against him for the accident at the factory? You won't get me telling you.This is a wonderfully bleak and atmospheric film with director Brad Anderson using dark and natural lighting to convey the fatigue and loneliness of Bale's character Trevor. Bale actually became deliberately thin for this part and when you first see this film, it's a shocking and grotesque sight to see particularly when Stevie comments on his exceptionally thin figure and he moves his body so you can actually see the shape of the bones beneath his skin. It's a testament to Bale that he has helped make Anderson's film so authentic in this way and like mostly every actor Bale has had his good and bad films but this is one of his better one with a performance that truly depicts the horror of what Trevor is going through.Be warned now this isn't a typical Hollywood pop-corn trash movie. It's the film with the air of an independent one with a low budget, the story is structured in such a way, it becomes confusing as to what's happening (quite similar though not as complex or grand a scale as Mulholland Drive) but stick with it as it is intriguing and by the end it is all explained. The twist of what actually happened was shocking though it would have been nice to understand more motivation behind Trevor's character of why. If you watch this after reading it or have seen it and read this. You will know what I mean. This is a great film for character study of a man and his mind. I thoroughly enjoyed this even if it did take a little time to become immersed in it as I was unsure at first with where the film was going. Be patient though and you will be rewarded with a complex but compelling and excellently acted and made movie that puts Bale's dismal performance of the Dark Knight (the last film I saw him in back in the shade)and him back on form. N0TE: It seems after this film his family fattened him up again. Thank god!",8,1,1,21 May 2010
The Amazing Spider-Man," A Great Spiderman, But Not Amazing.
","The Amazing Spiderman is certainly a diverse superhero movie, in the sense of how diverse the public opinion is, with those that love it and those who can't stand it. Me myself when I first saw the trailer, I was unimpressed and thought that rebooting the franchise after only five years after Sam Raimi's Spiderman 3 was a mistake of colossal proportions as it was just too soon. Then when Columbia Pictures advertised the next couple of trailers, I became more excited as there was more in it and I was quite looking forward to the movie, with myself becoming more open minded. In the end I quite enjoyed The Amazing Spiderman for what it was. I can from my perspective see both sides of how this film has been seen, in why people like it, whilst others despise it. The decision to concentrate on Peter's parents origins was an interesting angle to take I think, and though it is not fully resolved along with Peter wanting to catch the thief who killed Uncle Ben, it will most likely come up in the sequel, so I will not see that as a negative aspect of the film. Initially it took a while for me to get into the movie as though I knew they were aiming for a more serious and dark tone for the reboot than Sam Raimi's version, it took a while to adjust. Things I did like from the reboot apart from the refreshing angle of Peter's origins was the superb CGI of the Lizard and Spidey Suit. The 3D when it was properly implemented was impressive and the action sequences was terrifically choreographed.The acting was also up to a good standard. It took me some time to get used to Andrew Garfield as Spiderman, but in the end he acted well and carried the part with enough charisma. Despite that though he just paled in comparison to Toby Maguire, who captured the dopey, awkward teenager who took risks so much better. But that is just my personal opinion. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey was excellent in her scenes (though I felt she was underwritten) as she was adorable and charming. I also liked the fact the writers neatly avoided the stereotypical damsel in distress routine, which became irritatingly prominent with Mary Jane in Raimi's Spiderman. Stacey showed intelligence and seemed like a much more realistic character as a result. Martin Sheen and Sally Field as Uncle Ben and Aunt May carried their scenes with great aplomb as well. Unfortunately Rhys Ifans as the Dr Curt Conners/Lizard fared less well, with though a decent enough performance, was terribly written. The Lizard as a villain wasn't convincing enough for me as a true adversary to Spiderman as he was also underwritten like most of the cast. This is one of my main problems of The Amazing Spiderman as the film just felt so rushed even though it was longer than Raimi's Spiderman. There is substance throughout the entire movie, but it only scratches the surface with underwritten roles for these characters like Stacey, Aunt May and the Lizard who don't get to flex out their characters enough. In terms of the story itself, like the Lizard's motivation and Peter's parents past and the death of Uncle Ben just felt too quick and patchy. This is not due to the fact you don't find out more about Peter's father or that the thief who murdered Uncle Ben is not apprehended. It's down to that these moments of the film felt so rushed with though there is some emotion, the impact of these events on the characters is not prolonged enough. I felt as though the film was trying to bring style too much to the forefront and not enough substance, which was lacking.Part of this reason for substance lacking is the main reason why this movie does not stand up to the Raimi's first two Spiderman movies. It lacks an emotional punch, heart and humour (though there is some in TAS, I loved the scene when Spiderman apprehends the car thief) there just wasn't enough and as a result I didn't feel an infinity with these characters or really come to care about them unlike in Raimi's, which gave it more depth in story and character development. I admire director Marc Webb's idea of the reboot and he really does try, but in the end though I love the style of the film and appreciated it's attempt at interesting story arcs and character development, it lacked that real emotional punch and comedy factor, which would have made it even more fun and a superhero people could connect with. Don't get me wrong it was fun, with some also great acting and action, but it wasn't enough for me as it was easily forgettable. By all means do go and see this as it does have some merit and I thoroughly enjoyed all it's 136 minutes. I would go and see the sequel as this film showed great potential, which I hope will be further developed in the sequel. It was a great effort on the whole. But for me this Spiderman didn't quite live up to his title. He was great yes, but just not amazing.",7,1,4,9 July 2012
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Scott Pilgrim rocks the world!
","Scott Pilgrim vs the World is similar to Kick-Ass with references to the comic book world and the pacing and tone of the film where it takes you by the balls and goes on one heck of a roller-coaster ride and blows off any expectations you have of it. No doubt with the sequel of Kick-Ass 2: Balls to the Wall (A brilliant title if I might add) will produce the same hopefully. The one difference between Scott Pilgrim and Kick-Ass is that Pilgrim is more tame and not as violent and crude. But it is still excellent.Scott Pilgrim vs the world won't be to everyone's taste as I found out when I took my fifty year old father to see it with me. Director Edgar Wright previously responsible for the hilarious Hot Fuzz with Simon Pegg and Shaun of the Dead (though I've never seen it). I believe he has specifically targeted a younger audience with this movie. It's highly unlikely (though not impossible) that anyone over thirty will enjoy it. And even then there are those who wouldn't enjoy this film as it won't be everyone's cup of tea, which is fair enough. But I did love this.From the start it's clear to me that Wright goes for a more visual and style movie more than substance, but this isn't a bad thing. Comic strip words fly across the scene at different angles and speeds and makes the experience more vibrant. With that coming with the excellent action sequences makes it even more exhilarating. It's wacky, nuts and over the top, but it's so much fun, it left me on a buzz, Through the comic element of the film comes numerous references to the pop and rock culture and old computer video games. But also it's hilariously funny. Thanks to a good script, which has moments of wit. The comic timing with Micheal Cera as Scott and particularly his gay roommate Wallace Wells (Kieran Culkin) is perfect, which brings me onto the acting. Micheal Cera makes a capable enough lead and he has a certain charm for the character. He even looks impressive when fighting Romana's evil ex's, but for some reason I couldn't help thinking he looked more fifteen than twenty two. The other actor who I really liked was Kieran Culkin. He gave for me the most and best laughs and Ellen Wong as Knives Chau who plays Scott's first girlfriend before he meets Romana was entertaining to watch.Initially some of the problems I had with this film and stopped short of giving it a ten for a start is Mary Elizabeth Winstead who played Romana, she was okay, but I just didn't like her performance much and she looked bored for most of this. Another problem is the lack of character development. I could never really believe that Scott really loved Romana. There isn't really much chemistry between them and the film fails to have an heart or charm when it comes to their relationship. I could see in a couple of moments between them that the movie tries to be touching, but it fails and just comes across as shallow. However they do look cute together so at least that is something. The story also is quite predictable where Scott has to defeat Romana's seven evil ex's in order to win her heart.However I'm not going to put this down to much as I generally loved it overall. So much so I had the biggest grin on my face afterwards and it stayed on my face for so long I began to wonder if I would ever be able to change my facial expression. In the end Scott Pilgrim rocked my world and if your under thirty and want to see something wacky or have a fondness for the comic strip genre. You will love this. Scott Pilgrim vs the World is one of the most refreshing and original films to come out this year. An exhilarating blast.",9,2,12,2 September 2010
Batman Begins," Batman's back! And he's brilliant!
","I have seen and enjoyed all the Batman films, the plot, characters and acting have always been great, but what makes Batman Begins stand out from all the rest is by going back to the beginning of the franchise, it has for me made it more refreshing (I'll explain why later) and having Chrisitan Bale as the main lead.Don't get wrong the three previous Batmans played by Micheal Keaton, Val Kilmer and George Clooney were competent enough but they always stood in the shade next to the villains, most noticeably in Batman Forever with Two Face and The Riddler played fantastically by Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey.The reason for this is that the character of Batman always lacked exploration of his character and emotions though these are touched briefly upon in Batman Forever and Batman and Robin.Batman Begins excels above all the others by making the hero's (namely Batman) as interesting to watch as the villain. Christopher Nolan the writer goes into great detail about Bruce Waynes past how lost his parents and how he ends up being Batman.This gives the film more of a sense of purpose, which adds depth to the character of Bruce Wayne. Christian Bales youthful looks, but charismatic acting make the character more human who you come to care about.But don't worry it isn't talking all the way through there is plenty of action which entertains balancing both the story and action sequence's.Other parts of the film are equally amazing,the cinematography of Gotham is dark like Tim Burton style but more modernised making it more realistic.The special effects are stunning to look at visually.Liam Neeson is strong as the role of the villain as is Cillian Murphy as Dr. Crane, Sir Micheal Caine (as Alfred) and Morgan Freeman shine in there roles.Finally Gary Oldman is on form with his part playing Commissioner Gordon.This film isn't perfect in terms of acting like Tom Wilkinson as gangster Carmine Falcone is not menacing at all and Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes dosen't for me make much of an impact, which is why I didn't give this a ten out of ten.But forgetting that every other part of this film is brilliant and if your a fan of the Batman films you will love this.",9,0,0,3 October 2009
Twilight," This movie title should have been called Twilight Torture!
","I would just like to say before I review this god awful movie a huge thank you to all those who hated this and the new one (though I have't seen it I couldn't put myself through the torture again) and gave the films a one star or even a bit more rating. I have hugely enjoyed reading a lot of these reviews that have slated Twilight into the ground and has provided me with lots of enjoyable entertainment. For a lot of you reviewers your comments on saying how rubbish this film was had me in tears of laughter because I couldn't agree more.First off I can understand why a lot of girls like this movie gorgeous Edward played by Robert Patterson sets your heart throbbing yada yada yada and even the special effects though tacky can hardly be surprising for such a small budget and I wouldn't have minded but every other part of this movie rings awfulness so much that it's excruciating.OK well the basic story we all know about the character of Bella falls for Edward and finds out he is an 100 year old vampire and gets sucked into his world and where she meets his family and there rivals who want Bella for there next meal.Unfortunately they don't get her a pity really then I wouldn't have had to put up with her. Now Kristen Stewart can act I know that for a fact from seeing her when she was only 12 and starred in Panic Room with Jodie Foster but in this she is beyond awful. She always sounds somber when talking to Edward and just mumbles her lines as though she dosen't know how to speak. Not that Robert Pattinson another good actor playing the character of Cedric Diggory in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire fears any better. The romantic chemistry between Bella and Edward is about as electric as the relationship between water and fire when it comes into contact just goes out. The acting just feels so forced 'well we'll act if we must' and the characters are so boring and underdeveloped. It's just left me extremely frustrated and what about the story vampires shimmering in daylight. What trollop came up with that idea?The script seemed to have been written by a five year old and putting it that way a five year old could right a better script and the dialogue is so cliché and cheesy that it was cringe worthy. It's clear from this film that to call it a romance is an insult and I just got so irritated by all involved and I was disappointed by Stewart and Patttinson's non existent wooden acting which was as wooden as though tree trunks in the woods in the film as they can act but not thisI think the reason this film has done well with girls is that are so focused on gawping lovey dubby eyed at Edward that they don't realise how terrible the rest of the movie is. It is absolutely torture this film, a waste of time and money to have made and seen.Even though I won't see the new one I get sick of seeing the damn books and posters everywhere grrrr! But as long as these reviews slating the film keep coming in I should be happy. Sorry Twilight fans if I've offended you with this review but I have to say how I really felt about this film otherwise I wouldn't be honest.",1,7,9,2 December 2009
The Transporter," Transport me elsewhere...away from this movie.
","Luc Besson has always been more of a visuals and styles than a story and substance director. His film Leon proved that but that was very enjoyable and was believable whereas The Transporter, well oh dear. This was watchable don't get me wrong, but as Hollywood trashy fun, minus the word fun mostly and it's just Hollywood trash.Well the basic story is that Jason Statham plays ex-army soldier Frank Martin who 'transports' packages for anyone to earn money, but Frank has three rules, which are no new deals or renegotiation of old ones, no names and never open the package, but he breaks the rules and gets involved with a Chinese girl Lai (Qui Shu) whose caught up in people's smuggling.And that's it, the film suffers from lack of story or depths to the characters, which makes them uninteresting and you not care about them. Lai sleeps with Frank for no reason even though he treats her badly, though he is just doing his job. There are plot holes the size of a black hole like the villain goes after Frank because he opened the package, but he was nowhere near him when he did it, so how would he know? That's never explained. The script and dialogue is very cheesy and cliché. Also the acting is atrocious, no one can act in this though Statham isn't too bad, but he just wasn't convincing much at all nor was Qui Shu and even though Francois Berleand as Inspector Tarconi was good, the script didn't help him even though Frank and him have a history, that is never delved into. The only reason I gave this a three star was because the action was though preposterous was exciting and choreographed well with some nice scenery and music, but this was predictable and badly made mostly. Transport yourself away from this one.",3,0,1,7 August 2010
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," These Apes are well worth rising to go and see on the big screen.
","After the initial success of the original Planet of the Apes back in 1968 with Charlton Heston (which I saw only a couple of years ago and thoroughly enjoyed) they did three sequels preceding it which weren't bad through into the early 70s. Then in 2001 tragically Tim Burton tried a remake/reboot with Mark Walghberg at the helm. For me as it was seen generally by the public it was absolutely awful. Finally after another decade director Rupert Wyatt has made a second attempt at a reboot/remake and I am pleased to say he has carried it off with great aplomb.This version first sees good-intentioned scientist Will Rodman (James Franco) doing experiments on genetically enhanced Apes to try and find a cure for Alzheimer's which his father Charles (John Lithgow) has. He ends up taking home a baby ape that he calls Caeser (Andy Serkis) when it's mother dies after being killed by security guards who thought she was going on the rampage while really she was protecting Caeser. Whilst taking care of Caeser Will discovers a drug within the Apes that will help cure his father as he also teaches Caeser how to socialise. He also develops intelligence (a side effect of the drug). Meanwhile Will ends up dating vet Caroline (Frieda Pinto) who loves Apes as much as Will.As years go by Will's father starts to deteriorate again as the drug begins to wear off and an incident with Caeser defending Charles against an abusive next door neighbour gets the Ape catered off to a sanctuary with other Apes where Caeser is bullied by two guards, one being Dodge Landon (Tom Felton who played Malfoy in the Harry Potter franchise).Due to the cruel treatment Caeser receives at the hands of these humans and feeling neglected by Will he establishes himself as the alpha-male and plans a daring and well co-ordinated escape for freedom with the other Apes to rule over the humans (what will eventually be the case in the sequel). First off the CGI of the Apes themselves is absolutely jaw-dropping. Forget men in monkey suits in the original and the sequels that proceeded. These apes look - are actual apes, you wouldn't think that they are just special effects. It's a testament to giving this film realism as they move like real apes. The second biggest strength is the central performance by Andy Serkis as Casear, it also reflects the many strengths of silent movie making as Casear stays virtually wordless. Serkis gives a sensational central performance that deserves at least an Oscar nomination. Through Caesar's movements and facial expressions and when he finally speaks we feel everything he feels tenderness and love at Will looking after him and pain and rage when being mistreated by humans. It is bravo piece of acting and the audience feels for Casear's plight the whole way. It's unfortunate that the humans fair less well mostly. The only ones who really make any impact is Tom Felton as the nasty guard who makes the most of his menace in a cracking performance and Lithgow as Charles who gives an accurate and sensitive portrayal of one suffering from Alzheimer's. Even then they have little character development.Unfortunately James Franco and Frieda Pinto are nothing more than cardboard cut outs as they have severely unwritten roles (though they give decent performances). Franco though has more to do for the first hour as the screenplay sets him up well but loses interest in him in the last hour where he does nothing except fall for the expendable vet who could have been cut from the film altogether as she was very forgettable as a character and run hopelessly after Casear. Also some of the plot is a little too sloppy with a few glaring plot holes. How come Will's neighbours delay complaining to the authorities about the chimp until it is fully grown, when it has behaved scarily for years? How come Will waits so long before telling his boss about the miraculous properties of his drug? Did they somehow slip his mind? And why does Will's boss – a poorly written corporate type profit obsessed - change abruptly from ultra-cautious about animal testing to ridiculously reckless? However putting those faults aside there are other positives going for this film apart from Serkis's performance and the CGI. The action sequences namely the climax is well worth waiting for, which takes place on the Golden Gate Bridge is excellently choreographed and exciting to watch with beautiful cinematography from Andrew Lesnie who previous work included Lord of the Rings.There are faults with Rise of the Planet of the Apes but not enough to stop me enjoying it all the way through. This is a worthy addition to the other versions and a terrific first film for a reboot that is certainly worthy of a sequel. These Apes are well worth seeing on the big screen. I'm really looking forward to seeing the continuation of the story and seeing how this promising new franchise will continue to develop.",8,3,6,16 September 2011
Insidious," A bit creepy and well made, but completely bonkers, forgettable and uninvolving.
","The horror film Insidious when I looked at the IMDb rating of 7.3 on here I became very sceptical, thinking due to three previous film experiences that it was highly overrated. The films I refer to (two not being horrors, but still overrated were The Fighter and the hideously bad Thor). The third film which was a horror and had a rating of 7.4 was The Descent, which for me without a doubt is one of the worst horror films in years as I wouldn't even classify as that because it was so bad. So I settled down to Insidious with cautious optimism. I'm afraid to say again like The Descent, Insidious for me has been quite overrated, but it is not as out of proportion and this was much more entertaining than The Descent.The story itself has some promise with demons and spirits which is nothing new. But there are some creepy moments throughout the film when these spirits appear with unending ease, which stayed in my mind for a while during the film. The atmosphere created by director James Wan is done well to an extent with some impressive make up and special effects and his effective use of sound, though mainly this in the first forty minutes. The acting too (though not amazing) was reasonable for a horror. But really the film lost heart after about forty five minutes as it became more and more silly where I just laughed at certain scenes (and I'm glad from looking at the audience reviews on here I wasn't the only one) as it didn't look at all that real. When they camera does an extreme close up of like the demon, it looked like some ridiculous attempt from a child at making a Halloween costume. The thing is Insidious does market itself as a serious horror and me laughing at it is what disrepute's it to being better than it could be for me. It is completely bonkers with a stupid ending, but strangely in a way it being silly made it more enjoyable in a goofy sort of way.But by the end the film had lost it's chilling atmosphere and was half horror and comedy and though it was entertaining, it didn't remotely scare me and was uninvolving and forgettable. It's nothing special but is enjoyable enough to watch and it passes the time and is more entertaining than The Descent.",6,2,8,2 May 2011
2012," Amazing CGI and a script so cheesy and acting to go with it makes this a so bad it's good film.
","2012 I have been looking forward to for a while and suffice to say Roland Emerich delivers again though it's just not on the same level as Independence Day or The Day After Tomorrow as 2012 when it comes to the characters and the dialogue was very cheesy indeed and the acting was terrible (though the best performance I thought was Danny Glover who was OK) and wasn't on par with Emmerich's other films I've just mentioned.But the fact that it is so cheesy with all the usual disaster movie clichés is what made the film so entertaining as it was very funny like when Cusack's kid says to Yuri a Russian guy 'That's a big plane' and he replies 'It's Russian!' had me shouting with laughter. 2012 was a so bad it's good movie. Don't expect deep characterisation or an inventive script or even great acting because you won't get it. I don't think that was Emmerich's intention of comic relief however. It just sub-stained itself at the length of 2hrs and 40mins and the special effects are incredible to look at.If your in the mood for a really cheesy film that will make you laugh and you don't take seriously (but by looking at loads of reviews on this website that isn't the case) and jaw dropping effects, you'll like this like me.",7,1,1,14 May 2010
Kick-Ass," Does this film Kick-Ass? You bet!
","Kick-Ass is one of the most original films to come out in years, particularly in the superhero genre. Forget Batman, Spiderman and Superman. Kick-Ass is the new hero in cinema. Aaron Johnson played nerdy Dave desperate to be a superhero though he has no ounce of powers and is just a normal fifteen year old as he asks how far would go to protect someone you don't know being hurt? Would you stop to help them or just look the other way? He's also longing for a beautiful girl in school called Kate. He teams up with Hit-Girl, a very cool and superbly acted part played by Chloe Moretz and Big Dadddy, Nicolas Cage (seriously) dressed up like Batman with the exact replica voice of Adam West to take down a drug lord played excellently by Mark Strong who also has a son who dresses up as a hero calling himself Red Mist.Chloe Moretz steals the show in my opinion as she is the one who truly kicks ass, taught by her dad to shoot, fight and kill with swords (grown up men!) This is a fantastic film that takes you by the balls and takes you on a roller-coaster ride of your life. All expectations of what you think this film will be like is thrown out of the window. With a superb script and acting. (Nicolas Cage being back on form after his less than average performances of recent). Kick-Ass is so outrageously daft in a brilliant way making it deliciously daring and absolutely hilarious and it dosen't pretend to be otherwise as it makes great fun of itself. The action sequences are also crafted with an expert eye. My jaw dropped when I first saw it. It's that amazingly done. But be warned though it is funny it's also extremely crude and violent so if you don't like guts steer clear.The movie is intelligent in my opinion with such originality and daftness. Kids becoming superheroes with no powers! I absolutely loved it and Matthew Vaughn knows how to keep the pace of the film going, not by endless expanded scenes but keeping the characters moving and transitioning the film from romance to action to comedy and drama ceaselessly which is no easy task. There is the definite possibility of a sequel on it's way. If you haven't seen this yet, what are you waiting for? GO!",9,6,19,16 April 2010
Unknown," An excellent mystery action thriller all round that I'm glad came to be known.
","Unknown stars Liam Neeson as Dr. Martin Harris who arrives in Berlin Germany with his wife Elizabeth (January Jones) for a conference. At the hotel they are staying at he remembers he left one of his briefcases at the airport and catches a cab to go back and get it. But on the way he and the cab driver, a woman Gina (Diane Kruger) are in an accident and crash off a low bridge where during the plunge Martin hits his head on the window.He wakes up four days later from a coma in hospital and finds he has amnesia as his memory is fragmented. He remembers his wife at the hotel and goes to her but she claims she's not married to him and produces her husband Martin Harris (2). Martin claims number two stole his identity and despite trying to persuade people no one will believe him as he finds people he knows do not recognise him as the real Martin Harris, so he enlists the help of Gina and investigator Ernst Jurgen (Bruno Ganz) to help him find out the truth. Is 'Martin' losing his mind? Is it the amnesia? Or is there something more sinister going on? Well watch and find out for yourself. The film keeps you cleverly guessing from the start to the end with a cracking twist I didn't see coming. The action sequences are exciting with a one in particular breathtaking car chase with some great stunts, the story is strong for a Hollywood thriller and interesting, unfolding at a brisk pace with plenty of suspense and tension. Liam Neeson gives a terrific performance and is establishing himself as the new ageing hero of Hollywood like Harrison Ford and others previously. He is really convincing of a man being lost with no identity and makes you care for his character. Bruno Ganz as Jurgen gives a solid supporting performance. It is also superbly shot and edited by director Jaume Collet-Serra. What stopped short for me of giving this a ten is the fact there are some plot holes (though they are not too bad) and the supporting actresses are not memorable. Diane Kruger and January Jones give poor plain performances and do not really convince in their roles. Also the script isn't really that good and feels very run of the mill and there is little characterisation of Neeson's character, which could have rounded off the plot better. But despite these gripes it didn't bother me too much and I was highly relieved this was a great film after watching the terrible I am Number Four at the cinema only two days previously. Unknown is a excellent mystery thriller overall which I thought was even better than Taken. If you like Liam Neeson or want a great action and mystery thriller, Unknown is for you.",9,0,4,4 March 2011
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Still bad in a lot of ways, But this is better than Twilight!
","I saw the first film Twilight when it came out and absolutely hated it. From the acting to the story and special effects to the script and dialogue. I promised myself I would never ever see New Moon. I broke that promise as I saw it at my university at the film society with friends who were girls who begged me to come along. I was bored at the time and it was free and thought I could just fall asleep or maybe laugh at how awful it is but heavens above! This was actually mildly enjoyable! What has helped maybe I don't know is the new director Chris Weiz who took over from Catherine Hardwicke. The main problem still with the last film that hasn't changed is the acting from Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson. It's still really awful. There is still no chemistry between them and Stewart with her character of Bella is still boring and won't smile and just broods about. The two actors can't seem to finish a sentence without pausing awkwardly as though they have forgotten there lines. What Stewart and Pattinson need to do is eject more emotion into there voices that would convince me that they care about each other. Weiz has failed to instruct the actors more. The script and dialogue don't help as it is corny and clunked. Though less so than in Twilight that is an improvement. Another criticism is that the guys in the film always seem to have there damn shirts off. Have they heard of a shirt? Now obviously it's done because the teenage girls love it but logically within the realism that should be apparent in the film, it's just silly. Guys no matter if they are werewolves or vampires don't run about with there shirts off! But that is a minor criticism. Some of the music was also cringing, particularly one track that was played a couple of times when Bella was missing Edward, the girl couldn't sing!However one big improvement is those special effects, they were much better! Because more was spent on the film. When the guy Jacob and his friends transform from human to werewolf and vice versa was impressive to watch. I also did like some of the music as well. But the best thing about the film, which made the rating even this high was Taylor Lautner who played Jacob. His acting was surprisingly good. There was emotion in his voice when he talked to Bella and told her how he felt, which made me believe he really did care for her. (Take note Stewart and Pattinson) Other actors in it like Ashley Greene as Alice Cullen, Michael Sheen as the vampire Aro and Anna Kendrick as Jessica who is Bella's friend make the most of there tiny cameos. In the end New Moon was watchable but still too long. I would be willing to see the third one and hope that there will continue to be improvement, hopefully with Stewart and Pattinson's acting. If it does get better along with better dialogue and script (though in New Moon it was better than Twilight) I would give it a higher rating. This is bad in a lot of ways but there have been improvements and are some good things about it. Believe me I'm surprised I even mildly enjoyed it. Let's hope the third continues on the road to improvement.",4,6,9,23 March 2010
Transformers," Transformed me into a fan!
","What a fantastic film! That's the first thing I thought when the credits rolled up. I saw this only on TV a while back on one of the digital channels. This was much better than the terrible sequel because the film was a new idea with a fresh plot, the special effects were excellent and I loved the car transforming into the robots and back again. Shia LaBeouf's performance was great with decent support from Jon Voight and Megan Fox who played the loved interest. It was also very funny and not childish like the second and the camera-work wasn't all over the place. I will always like this first film, which Michael Bay has done well with but not the second. Yes this film is long but it holds your interest because it's new but the second was just repetitive.",8,5,7,29 June 2011
Mulholland Drive," Wonderfully weird, masterfully told and made from for me the genius David Lynch!
","Until recently I had never heard of this film Mulholland Drive let alone the director David Lynch until only a couple of weeks ago.I heard about Lynch from my class teacher who is a massive fan of his movies. He told me that Mulholland drive was a very confusing film so I decided to give it a watch before the lecture to try and better understand it I watched it and I was initially confused as the plot is very difficult to follow but when it finished I was so intrigued to find out what the movie meant I got a couple of books out about it and I eventually think figured it out.This is an incredible film, unique, refreshing and intelligent, which nowadays is not what Hollywood gives. Lynch directs Mulholland Drive with a nightmarish quality incorporating the theme of dreams and psychology into the mix.The story starts off with a woman in an accident in a limousine when two cars with youths in who are drag racing crash into them. The woman who stumbles out makes it to an empty house where Betty played by Naomi Watts is staying as it's rented out by her aunt. Betty is an actress who wants to make it big in Hollywood. Initially she finds the women who calls herself 'Rita' played by Laura Harring. Betty decides to help her figure out who she is as Rita has lost her memory. With Rita she had a handbag and in it they find lots of money and a blue key. Betty helps Rita trace herself to a woman she thinks she remembers whose called Diane who may have gave her the key but when they track her down she's been murdered. Meanwhile Betty and Rita grow closer and fall in love.A separate story is that the one of the youths who crashed into the limousine at the beginning is shown doing a hit on three people for a book, whilst a producer Adam Kesher played by Jason Theroux who Betty was going to audition for a part in his movie ends up going on the run from the mafia after refusing to cast a girl Camilla Rhodes they want but eventually he accepts. This all takes place within about about 110 minutes of the movie, which more all less makes sense then in the last forty minutes everything you thought you knew turns on it's head. When Betty and Rita have slept together Rita murmurs the name of a club in her sleep so her and Betty go to an early morning show to see what she can remember. When they get back Rita and Betty go to her room and Rita gets out a blue box, which the key fits in but at this point Betty had disappeared from the room and when Rita opens the box it's empty that when the film becomes bizarre but in a brilliant way.Okay here goes the character of Betty (Watts) becomes the character of Diane who was found dead by Betty. Diane is in love with Rita who now becomes Camilla who she met on a set of a film. Camilla has been helping her get roles in movies and they have fallen in love. Unfortunately Camilla has been sleeping around and eventually ends up being engaged to Jason. Diane becomes devastated as Camilla calls things off so Diane hires a hit-man who was the youth in the car at the start and who did the hit on those three people to kill Camilla. He does but in the end she feels so guilty for what she has done that she kills herself. Basically the real story was of Diane falling in love with Camilla but her ending it as she is engaged to Adam and Diane wanting to kill Camilla and does as she also ends up killing herself. The first two thirds of the film is her twisted fantasy of how she wanted it to be with her and Camilla. David Lynch is an amazing director and deserves to be up there with Spielburg, Eastwood and Cameron. Mulholland Drive cleverly manipulates the audiences expectations subtly so they have to figure out the puzzle themselves. I was totally shocked by the twists when I figured it out as there a lot of false red herrings. The portrayal of the human condition of dreams, reality, insanity build from love and betrayal is explored in superb depth. The lighting is of that film noir 1940s expression which is wonderfully artistic. The music is beautiful, powerful and though provoking which added the tension and suspense to the scenes. There isn't much dialogue and there are long pauses between character's interaction but through visually there body language and the way they say it depending on what is happening in the film progresses the story. The acting as well, Jason Theroux gives a good performance and so does Laura Harring, but Naomi Watts steals the movie, her first acting role this was and it made her. She deserved it. Here she gives the performance of a lifetime, worthy of an Oscar. It's one of the finest performance I have ever seen on film. One scene that stands out is the love scene with her and Harring aches with passion and believability but throughout Watts is totally convincing whether wanting to help Ruth in her fantasy or her menacing jealously in her reality.Lynch has made a perfect film which is daring, unique and wonderfully complex with intelligence. He knows how to bring out the best in his actors and the lighting and the music is truly gorgeous. I will call this a David Lynch masterpiece. After Mulholland Drive I am going to watch more of his films. Something tells me Lynch may join my list of best ever directors. One of the greatest films I've seen and one I can't wait to view again. A truly remarkable film experience.",10,4,6,5 February 2010
Clash of the Titans," Should be the called The Crash and Collaspe of the Titans!
","Congratulations the Clash of The Titans or as I renamed, see review title above. You've just been found the worst film of 2010 so far. The Book of Eli, which I originally deemed the worst has moved up by one spot. Clash of The Titans had very mixed reviews from audiences (though most critics hated this) but I liked the look of the trailer and the film had an excellent cast. How wrong was I? This was a load of crap. A trashy Hollywood film that was desperate to make money. A sham! The story was predictable, the acting was awful, like Sam Worthington (whose was so wooden I felt like I had splinters), which is sad as I liked him in Terminator Salvation and he was very good as the lead in Avatar, Ralph Fiennes got on my nerves as he sounded like he had a parched sore throat and Gemma Atterton though pretty spoke like a posh girl shopping for shoes! The acting was theatrical. I felt like I watching this on stage. And because of the superficial acting there's no depth to there characters and I didn't care about any of them particularly when Sam Worthington kept flying through the air like a demented monkey screaming like Tarzan. (He would be good in the circus trade).The 3D and special effects though okay in parts was mostly tacky and the whole thing took itself so seriously it was pathetically lame. I just laughed at it and the action sequences were boring and lacked excitement not to mention the camera swung so fast for some of it I couldn't see what was happening (Michael Bay, grrr!). The last action sequence was a very anti-climax and lasted about two minutes. Some of the scenery was nice though and I thought Liam Neeson who played the god Zeus, his acting was good but it wasn't enough. The director Louis Leterrier should be ashamed of himself. This film promised so much and dosen't deliver. It's an insult to the audience. Boring, uninvolving and rubbish dribble that crashes and collapses into garbage. Do yourself a favour and save your time and money and miss this!",1,9,13,10 April 2010
The Adjustment Bureau," Great acting and lovely romantic chemistry, but the story and screenplay brings it down.
","The Adjustment Bureau has received mixed reviews on here so far and I am not surprised. The trailer has been marketed deceptively to the audience of an science fiction, action thriller and it only has one of the three. The thing is I knew specifically what the film was as one of my friends who saw it told me, a romantic drama. My rating for this film wasn't as high as I wanted to be as for a while I was internally struggling whether to award this a six or seven out of ten, but I decided on a six in the end.The plot consists of young man David Norris (Matt Damon) who is running for senate in New York. He ends up meeting a beautiful ballerina Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt) in the men's bathroom whilst practising a speech. They hit it off immediately and meet again on the bus, but a mysterious group of men dressed in hats are tailing him and he eventually finds out that they are part of a mysterious bureau that control the choices that humans make due to the past historical atrocities. One man called Thompson (Terence Stamp) tells him. The bureau helps certain people get to the 'top' to help keep the world in order. They try to keep David and Elise apart as David is destined to become down the road the president of America and him being with her would ruin that.But he refuses to heed them and threatens to expose their existence so they do everything they can to stop him, which includes using some sort of magic with their hats, which enable them to walk through doors that lead to different locations. David with help from one of the bureau Harry Mitchell (Anthony Mackie) helps him get Elise back and outrun the rest of the bureau.The main reason to see this movie and what keep it afloat is the great acting from the two main characters. Matt Damon gives a surprisingly touching performance of a man torn between his career and love for Elise. He is even convincing as a man running for the senate. Emily Blunt is even better with a terrific performance and has a wonderful charming charisma that won me over. The chemistry between her and Damon is superb and convincing and you do feel as though they love each other. They are a charming couple, which make them likable and you want them to be together. The supporting performance from Terence Stamp and Anthony Mackie are good and lend decent support to the main cast. The script has it moments of sparky wit particularly in the first couple of scenes between Blunt and Damon and the cinematography of the scenery is mesmerising. The story is also interesting to an extent of choices, fate and love, but it dosen't go far enough in depth and just brush strokes over it and there some plot holes and unanswered questions like how was the bureau created and when? And the ending was rather silly. As Harry explains to them, they are allowed to stay together because the chairperson changed the plan, but why didn't they just change it to that in the first place? Why put everyone through that? Harry mentions it might be a test and that the chairperson was won over by their determination to be together, but it is too vague and apparently the chairperson can take any form. How? Of another person? Animal? If they can take the form of any person, did their decision to change the plan alter because of the 'person' they took have different opinions on things? It's never explained and as a result the screenplay just feels empty with huge voids that should have been filled.It's a good film and I recommend seeing it, but it isn't all it's cracked up to be with even the action it had being of little excitement. Damon and Blunt's acting and their romantic chemistry though carry this film afloat, but it was disappointing as it did have the potential to be much more than it delivered. All the same I enjoyed it from beginning to end and if you want a nice romance film then this is for you.",6,0,2,9 March 2011
The Hangover Part II," A fun sequel, but we've seen it all before.
","The Hangover was an unexpected hit for audiences and film critics alike even with typical American gross out comedy humour we come to associate with director Todd Phillips previously responsible for comedies such as Due Date (which was terrible), Old School (which wasn't bad) and Road-trip (an absolute gem of a film that despite being gross out as I'm not generally a fan of these types, it's an old favourite I've watched for so many years, I don't mind and I couldn't hate it even if I tried. Also as they're students, in a way you expected them to do act like that, and yes I know it's a stereotype and that not all students act like it but still these ones can get away with it, so it's genuinely funny as a result). The reason I loved The Hangover was because despite the gross out humour the characters became likable in their befuddlement and they do grow up at the end of the movie. Not to mention the script was extremely inventive, with just when you thought things for the group in Vegas couldn't get any worse it did making it hilariously catastrophic. The sequel sets the premise as the same as the first one where the same group Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and Doug (Justin Bartha) jet to Thailand for their friend Stu's weeding to future wife Lauren (Jamie Chung). The night before against their better judgement, the guys go to party along with Lauren's sixteen year old cousin Teddy (Mason Lee) and predictably the next morning wake up (apart from Doug who left to go back to the hotel earlier in the evening) with no idea where they are with Teddy missing and joined by their old friend from Vegas the Chinese mobster Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong). So Phil, Stu and Alan have to again frantically rush around trying to piece the clues together of what happened and find where Teddy is before Stu's wedding starts. As reiterated by previous reviewers The Hangover Part II is pretty much exactly the same as is predecessor with the same structure of the story and the similar events that happen to them, like in the first one the guys had to contend with the tiger but now it's a monkey. The jokes are pretty much the same with no comedic originality, so it is formulaic and does become a bit tiresome at moments. It's a pity that Todd Phillips has stuck to the same formula, though I can see why he would as it was such a success in the first one. But part II just goes through the motions.Saying that the acting is good from the main cast with great cameos from Mike Tyson, Mr. Chow and Kingsley (Paul Giamatti), there is a comfortable familiarity with the main characters and there were enough laughs and chuckles that kept me entertained from start to finish. But they shouldn't commission a third part as they would be pushing it. Part II is a fun sequel and it's worth seeing if your a fan of the first one, but don't expect nothing new as we have seen it all before.",6,1,2,15 July 2011
Avatar," Not only Cameron's best movie and best film of 2009 but one of the greatest of all time!
","I had extremely high expectations for Avatar and I was not disappointed particularly with James Cameron being director. All his other films like Aliens, True Lies,Terminator 2 and Titanic amongst others were brilliant and Avatar is no exception. Extremely long running time of 162 minutes but they flew by. This film started off good and just got better until the point about halfway through when I fell in love with it.The acting was superb from all the cast in particular Sam Worthington as the Protagonist, Sigourney Weaver and Zoe Saldana with good support from Michelle Rodrigeuz. The action sequences were exciting, it was superbly shot and the 3D just blew me away. It was amazing and made the scenery of the lush forest and mountains simply breathtaking with perfect attention to detail with the different plants and animals.The story was good with some unexpected twists and though the dialogue and script were basic, it was never cheesy or corny and there was some good and witty funny one liners and later with a small romantic subplot between the two main leads was touching and believable made the script feel more meaningful and the music was simply beautiful.This is the best film of the year for me and knocks Star Trek off the top! It's also Cameron's best film and one of the best of all time. Avatar in 3D gives the audience such a unique experience with the visual spectacle. This movie makes Cameron for me stand alongside Steven Spielburg and Peter Jackson as the Hollywood Kings of directors. This cost 300 million dollars to make and five years to do and it shows. This should get Oscars. If you haven't seen this yet. I implore you to go. You will not be disappointed. Absolutely incredible!",10,6,13,18 December 2009
Invictus," Interesting and slightly inspiring but it could have been so much more
","My dad wanted to see this yesterday but I wasn't too keen on seeing a film but I went anyway and sufficed to say I enjoyed myself. Invictus tells the story of Nelson Mandella as president of Africa who joins forces with the captain of the South African rugby team Francois Pienaar to ask them to win the world cup and help unite the country in the awake of the apartheid.This is a very good film. Morgan Freeman as Mandella was terrific. He played the part perfectly with the touch of charm, heart, intellect and thoughtfulness. Matt Damon was okay as Francois but I have to say it could have been played better with another actor in his place. Clint Eastwood directs once again with flair capturing the essence of the story and focusing it firmly on one event as the apartheid was more than that, which is where I feel he went slightly wrong. It would have been nice to see more of an exploration about the rise of Mandella and the wider impact of the apartheid instead of just about the world cup.It was interesting and inspiring to watch though I didn't feel the inspiration until the very end. It wasn't amazing as there were parts where I was getting a bit bored but it does pick up. What did let this down slightly was Matt Damon's satisfactory but nothing more performance and lack of the powerful tone of the situation and more exploration of the wider implications of the apartheid and Mandella's biography and more inspiration surrounding it. Eastwood has failed in this sense and instead of turning into the masterpiece it could have been like Changeling, it's just very good film, which for me is not normal in his vocabulary and it is easily forgettable unlike Changeling. But it would be a shame to put this down too much as this is still well worth seeing even if it's a bit on the long side.",7,0,1,12 April 2010
Super 8," A super film all round.
","Spielburg and Abrams pay tribute by combining elements from other Spielburgian movies such as Jurassic Park, ET, War of the Worlds, Poltergeist and The Goonies amongst others to create Super 8. Revolving around a bunch of teenagers, 12 year old Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) who loves to make old movies and is doing one for a competition (he is the make up/special effects guy). His love of model-making brings him into conflict with his father who is the sheriff of the town Jackson (Kyle Chandler) who wants him to play baseball. Their relationship is already fractured due to the death of Joe's mother in an industrial accident who he was close to. The other two kids who are Joe's friends Charles who is the director (Riley Griffiths) and Cary (Ryan Lee). Charles invites young girl Alice (Elle Fanning) to act as a role in the film. Whilst filming a train crashes near them that was no accident as they find their science teacher in the crash who gives them a warning.Soon the military turn up and try to keep everything hush hush as the town's dogs and household appliances like microwaves start to go missing. Joel and his friends are caught up in what's going on. Meanwhile a lovely sub-plot develops of a budding romance between Joe and Alice.The plot itself is nothing new but the combined elements of Spielburg's other movies creates something fascinating and new (though I know not everyone would agree), the special effects of the alien when you see it is truly spectacular and terrifying in a way. Abrams teasingly keeps the alien hidden until right near the very end keeping you uneasy and in suspense. But what makes this film such a winner in my eyes is the fact that these characters are ones you come to care about and the acting is really great. They all in particular Elle Fanning (who acts tremendously in one scene with a performance in a performance blew me away) give performances of commendable charm. The screenplay is very smart in this respect as the friendship between the kids and Joe and his dad and Alice and her's feels very real and give the character's some depth (Alice's dad blames himself for Joe's mum's death as on the day of the accident she covered for his shift in work). It also lend the film some heart, particular in one touching scene where Joe is playing an old video in his room of the times he had with his mum and Alice feels sad as she blames herself in a way for her death. There is also plenty of suspense and tension throughout the film and some great action sequences that are terrifically choreographed.This is just a super film all round in the end, that though it does contain some plot holes, it didn't detract from entertaining and thrilling me from start to finish. One for the whole family to enjoy and a film I will be adding to my DVD collection in future. I really love this movie.",9,0,1,15 August 2011
Rio," A wonderful and infectious animation that can lift anyone's spirits!
","I have been looking forward to Rio ever since seeing the funny orange advert of it. My expectation for this animation were exceedingly high and I am pleased to say it more than delivered. The basic synopsis basically consists of a blue macaw called Blue (Jesse Eisenberg) who is domesticated is looked after by kind book shop owner Linda (Leslie Mann). One day their happy lives are altered by the arrival of a Brazil ornithologist who tells them that Blue is the last male macaw of his kind and is in danger of being extinct. He proposes that Blue come to Rio De Janiero to mate with beautiful female macaw called Jewel (Anne Hathaway). Linda is persuaded and her and Blue go, but when there Jewel takes a disliking to Blue (he can't fly) and soon he and her are captured by poachers who want to sell them for money. Eventually they escape to the jungle to try and get free from each other (as they are chained to one another) as Jewel wants to fly free on her own and Blue wants to get back to Linda. Meanwhile her and the ornithologist try and track them down with the help of young boy Fernando (Jake T Austin).On Blue and Jewels journey they come up against evil cuckatoo Nigel (Jemaine Clement) and other colourful bird characters who help them like Nico (Jamie Fox), Pedro (voiced by Black Eyed Peas member, Will i Am), Rafael (George Lopez) and bulldog Luiz (Tracy Morgan). As they journey Blue and Jewel predictably warm to each other as the film reaches it's climax.Some of the small gripes I really had with Rio, which stopped me giving this a ten is the fact you don't really emotionally connect to the characters as the film dosen't really have heart or any deep meaningful message like the Toy Story films or Up. However I certainly felt a fondness for the characters and yes the story narrative is predictable (as people have pointed out) of Blue and Jewel being together and triumphing over Nigel and the poachers. But most animations are anyway like Toy Story and Up, they all have happy endings, so I don't think that should really be a criticism for Rio.But I loved everything else, the 3D (which was excellent) was used to magnificent effect and made the visual animation (at top quality I might add) an even more exhilarating experience with the different plants and birds, it was very colourful and vibrant with some breathtaking scenery of Rio itself. The voice-over acting was top-notch. Eisenberg superbly voices Blue, which kept me entertained, with some funny moments and even Anne Hathaway is great (after her disastrous performances in films of recent) at voicing Jewel as being a fierce and independent bird but eventually warming up to Blue. Leslie Mann lends to Linda an endearing quality, Jermaine Clement is terrific voicing Nigel and is very funny whenever he is on screen, whilst the other voice-over actors Tracy Morgan as dog Luiz and Will i Am, Jamie Fox and George Lopez provide great comic support and make the most of the time their characters have.What I also like was the script, which was refreshingly witty with in particular Blue and Nigel getting some great one liners. This made the film hilarious in parts as it was generally funny all the way through. The songs as well were well sung and had an infectious joy to them, but the whole film had that and as a result even though there is no emotional depth or substance in terms of any messages for kids. (like Toy Story 3) It is still great fun and the bottom line is kids will absolutely love this, whilst adults will find plenty to enjoy. It's suitable for the whole family. It certainly beats Rango the other animation I saw a couple of weeks ago (it wasn't as funny and was not suitable for kids as it was too intelligent) with western references they wouldn't and even I could not comprehend as I don't watch a lot of them.In the end Rio is a animation that I loved and can appeal to everyone. If anyone out there for whatever reason is in a sad or angry mood, seeing this for an hour and a half should certainly lift your spirits. Rio is the most wonderful animation to come out since Toy Story 3 last year. Long may the film's infectious joy and spirit last.",9,4,9,13 April 2011
Limitless," An excellent sci-fi thriller that takes you to the limit
","Limitless is for me one of the most original and best sci-fi thrillers to come out in years. This tells the story of first off dishevelled writer Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) who lounges in his small messy apartment trying to start his latest novel but unable to do as he suffers from writers block. He is like this for weeks, which turns into months where his current girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) ends their relationship because of the way he is. By chance on the street Eddie ends up running into his ex-wife's brother Vernon (Johnny Whitworth) who previously dealt in drugs but now works as a consultant for a pharmaceutical company. He offers Eddie a chance to sort his life out by offering him a drug MDT that can access one hundred percent of his brain instead of just the normal human capacity of twenty per cent. He takes it and develops super-human powers where he finds he can finish his book in a speed he never thought before. When the drug runs out in his system, he goes back to Vernon for more but finds he's dead. He then takes the rest of his stash and starts living the high life of being brilliant at everything like he can speak any language and is an expert at finances and the stock market. Due to this he ends up working for Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro). As Eddie continues taking the drug he starts to develop problems like the drug's side effects and the fact a drug dealer wants the drug to take and sell to his customers. This film really does take you to the limit with an interesting premise. If you had a chance to take MDT to get what you wanted in life would you? If you wanted to do something you knew you could never achieve and taking that drug would help you get it, would you? This concept is explored well to an extent as we start to see Eddie lose control of himself. The thing is it would have been better if the film had gone further. How was MDT created? Who created it? What are it's exact ingredients? But despite this I still absolutely loved this film. Apart from a great story as I said with an interesting premise, it is fantastically shot with some very interesting and unconventional camera shots (particular at the opening credits) which makes it refreshingly different. The pace and tone of the film flew by in terms of some gripping action sequences and plot developments. This had the great notion for me of there never being a dull moment as it developed into unexpected directions. The script was smart and quick-whipped throughout, the music was excellent and the acting was superb particularly by Bradley Cooper who was really convincing in his role with a terrific supporting performance from De Niro and Abbie Cornish who made the most of the little time she had on screen. I loved this film from start to finish as it was terrifically entertaining. Originally I wasn't going to see this but I changed my mind and I'm glad I did. Limitless is the fourth best movie I have seen this year. And I am pleased with the 7.4 IMDb rating it has received so far though it should be higher. Saying that not everyone will like this film, but I did. Just see this for yourself and make up your own mind. But for me it took me and reached it's limit.",10,4,9,24 March 2011
Rocky," An old classic that still packs a heck of a punch thirty-four year later.
","I must confess I have never ever watched the Rocky films before, none of them, though I knew that Slyvester Stallone played a boxer called Rocky. My brother is a big fan of the Rocky movies and has one to six as part of his DVD collection and I decided I would like to try watching them.Rocky for me is an excellent movie as most people looking at the reviews on this website would agree. It is much more than just about boxing as we follow Stallone's character of Rocky Balboa who does small time boxing and has a second job of collecting money for a loan shark from his clients. He lives in a rundown area in Philidelphia where he regularly goes into his local pet store where he has a thing for shop assistant Adrian Pennino (Talia Shire) who is very shy and withdrawn and is treated badly by her brother Paulie Pennino (Burt Young). Meanwhile heavy title weight champion of the world Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) wants to give a low time boxer at chance at the title and he chooses Rocky who accepts.What is most interesting is watching Rocky at how he lives his life and interacts with certain characters. Stallone gives a superb performance and though he may sound gruff when he speaks his lines, he does with a certain charm. Talia Shire as his love interest gives a great performance capturing the essence of her character Adrian trapped by her brother (A good supporting role by Burt Young) and very shy with little social interaction with others, but develops confidence by being around Rocky. Also Burgess Meredith as Mickey who offers to be Rocky's coach with his fight against Apollo is terrific in his supporting role as a man who is at the end of his days of boxing but still knows how the world works. Rocky and Adrian's romance, which is a substantial part of this film is beautifully depicted from two people one who is shy and awkward to one Rocky who tries to help her that evolves into two people comfortable with each other. The scene in Rocky's apartment where he and Adrian first kiss even though it's only for under a minute was electric. They make a nice couple with some good romantic chemistry there. Also there is depth to this movie with Rocky's character as we find out a bit about his life, his boxing past and even what he was like as a child.One other surprising aspect is the script. It seems very basic with just 'street-talk', but it is suited to the area he lives in (not that I'm saying all people in a less affluent area all speak street-talk). It was just suited to the film and as a result it works and makes it clever. The fighting itself with the showdown between Rocky and Creed is monumental with a excellently choreographed and tense fight as you root for Rocky. In that way it was inspiring. Rocky is not just about a boxer but how he lives his life with the area and who he interacts with. This gives more depth to his character and makes you care about him more. I never got bored with the length of two hours and now look forward to watching Rocky II and hope it will be great as well. An old classic this is but I loved it!",9,0,1,6 September 2010
The Descent," Descended into stupidity and for me sheer boredom.
","A simple question. 'What is a horror film designed to make it's audience do?' The answer is easy to frighten us. If a horror film can do that and to an extent makes us emotionally care on some level about the characters who are getting stalked or killed or whatever, then it's a horror that can be classified as such and is enjoyable to watch as we become involved.In short as you can guess from my rating The Descent fails to do either. I am staggered that the rating for one of the worst 'horror' films I have seen whether it's British or otherwise is this high of a 7.4. Granted I will agree that it is very gory and violent and if you are particularly averse to that but like horrors you might enjoy cringing. The Descent certainly earned it's eighteen certificate in that respect. The thing is I have seen lots of gory films and are probably more desensitised to movie violence than some people. (Even though sometimes I have to look away, like Eden Lake a truly excellent horror, which I wouldn't call entertaining, but the whole thing like the story, themes, characters and acting are greatly orchestrated.) Anyway the first five minutes of The Descent aren't too bad with a superb eerie scene in the hospital where the main character is in an accident. The film then chugs along at an average pace twenty minutes in before they enter the cave. The characters are set up nicely and the acting is okay for virtually unknown stars. But really there is little or no characterisation for the characters who are as thin as cardboard and the script is bad really.I would be prepared to overlook the bad script and little characterisation if the film had generally been frightening but it wasn't. I think overall I jumped in fright about four times in the whole film and two of those moments were before they even enter the cave. The first reason I was hardly frightened was because the film took far too long in getting going with an exhaustive pace of slowness. It's about fifty minutes in before you see the weird predator creatures that stalk them. Secondly the film's characters seems devoid of basic common sense. When the girl who acts as a guide of the cave leaves the guide book in the car deliberately, you know the movie is descending into stupidity. It becomes even more ridiculous when they are down in the caves and get trapped in when she tells them that they are not even in the cave that is on the guidebook and that no one has ever been in the caves before. She thought it would be a nice surprise for them to explore it. I mean how stupid can you get? I know humans can act less rationally but come on. Any 'expert' on anything of any sort always plans for contingencies and a 'guide' should never lie to the ones they are leading into a cave whether they are strangers or friends.With that you don't come to care about any of the characters as they (the woman guide really) steer themselves into death by their own stupidity and as the movie progressed it got sillier with one of the girls running away from the group when they find out about the predators. Duh! Sticking together in a group is probably a good idea as it maximises your chances of survival. They also just kept shrieking all the time and it got annoying. As a result of all this I was rooting for the predators to kill off the group and I'm pretty sure I wasn't meant to be on their side. It's just a relief when they do kill most of them but one (unfortunately) to rid myself of the boredom of listening to them and watching them. Ironically some of the scenes I found quite funny as the predators looked so fake, the CGI was awful even with a small budget, it's no excuse. As a result there's just no atmosphere.I watched this until the end hoping it would improve but it just got steadily worse. I know there is a part two but I won't watch it. I couldn't put myself through the torture of boredom again. This is one of worst made and stupidest horror films I have seen and isn't worth the time of day. If anyone is a horror fan and are thinking of seeing it I would advise to not waste your time. I have seen scarier twelve rated movies (The Others being a good example and that was brilliant). Just don't watch The Descent it's that bad.",1,9,17,21 March 2011
Some Like It Hot," No wonder this is an ultimate comedy classic!
","Another film I saw at my university in my Introduction to Film course though this one compared to the other two films I've watched which I've already reviewed though they were silent movies, which were Sherlock Junior which was mildly enjoyable and The Jazz Singer which was very good.Some Like It Hot is my sort of film, it had sound and was a typical classical Hollywood narrative but despite that it's still an old film and I usually am not a big fan of them. My dad and Nan are big fans of old movies and told me that Some Like It Hot is a hilariously brilliant film.When I went for my weekly lecture I had good hope that this film would be good, but I didn't expect it to be brilliant. I was wrong it was amazing. Now wonder this has been deemed one of Hollywood's golden age classic comedies.The basic story is about two male musicians played by Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis who are struggling to make ends meet in Chicago when they witness mobsters committing murder. They inevitably get caught witnessing the crime but escape the criminals unscathed but they get blood all over them and soon know they will be wanted men so they decide to join an all girl band that is travelling to Florida as the agency that they work for need two girls who are a saxophonist and a bass player.They dress up as the two women, but it's not that simple come arrive in Florida. They both fall for the singer of the girl band Sugar played deliciously by the sexy Marilyn Monroe and also attract attention from a rich millionaire (Well Jack Lemon does) and Tony Curtis dressing up in a captains outfit to woo Marilyn whilst at the same time trying to keep in disguise.This movie is hilarious. I was laughing all the way through. The comic chemistry between Curtis and Lemmon is superb. The timing of there comic antics is spot on. It becomes particularly funny when they are in the women's clothing and become Josephine and Daphne. Some of the antics I loved was when Curtis first dresses up as a captain and when Lemon as Daphne is doing the tango with he rich millionaire with a rose in his mouth had me crying with laughter. Also it's great fun when the Mobsters catch up with the two later and try and get away from them and the ending particularly when the rich millionaire finds out that Daphne is a man quotes the best line from the film. When Lemon reveals himself to be a man as he tells the rich millionaire he can't marry him because he's male, he dosen't care just as he dosen't care that 'Daphne smokes' etc. He says 'Nobody's perfect' Very funny indeed! Of course Mariyln Monroe has to be mentioned for her part in the film she makes a great impact on screen and not just because of her looks, she has great acting ability and a nice singing voice too. But it wasn't just the acting and the gags they were funny, they were also witty and inventive and that is partly in thanks to a superb script by great director Billy Wilder. He also edits this beautifully and the narrative has a great structure and well the story of men dressing up as women is great too! I was also pleased with the length of the film. Some may say two hours would be too long for this sort of film, but it sub stains itself. I couldn't find anything to fault about this film and at the end of watching it in the lecture me and my classmates clapped and gave it a standing ovation.I will certainly watch this movie in the future and I recommend that if you haven't seen this yet even if your a teenager like me you should see this you will regret it if you don't. I'm glad that this film was deemed one of the comedy classics of all time and that I was finally able to experience and agree with it.A wonderfully made, acted and hilarious comedy!",10,1,1,1 December 2009
Titanic," Beautiful and haunting. Truly epic on every scale.
","I must say I'm surprised at the low IMDb rating of 7.3 and that there are a lot of negative reviews on this website. But compared with millions loving this and winner of 11 academy awards, those voices of discontent against this film are left in the shade. Arguably for me James Cameron's greatest film. Titanic is a true epic of colossal scale. The acting is brilliant particularly with Leonardo Decaprio and Kate Winslet as Jack and Rose. They light up the screen as the two lovers separated by social class but not love. There romance is so beautifully depicted that you can't help but smile. The romantic story set aside the sinking is flawlessly intertwined.Though the film is in two parts the romance and the sinking the first hour and a half gives you the chance to come to know these two characters and others like nasty Cal Hockley (Billy Zane) and LoveJoy (David Warner) who play there parts excellently well with great support from Kathy Bates who plays the lively Molly Brown. There are some beautiful and forever memorable scenes between Jack and Rose when Jack first sees her, the third class party, when they kiss on the bow of the ship, Jack painting her naked, when they make love in the car and when they are both in the water after the ship has sunk and Jack dies. All these scenes and others are amazing. The music score by James Horner is hauntingly beautiful and sombre and made me cry when you see the full sinking in all it's horror.And you do James Cameron depicts everything showing not just the sinking from Jack and Roses perspective but different people in different parts of the ship as they scream desperately for help. So you end up caring not just for the main characters but all the small cameo roles played by hundreds of people. Morality questions are raised about how things were handled by white star liner. These are haunting images that burn in your mind and stay with you long after. The most haunting scene is when loads of passengers are in the water and when most of them had died. The cameras focusing on one of the lifeboats coming back is the ethereal feel of a mythic force. Cameron creates suspense and tension at whether the two lovers will survive and you just deeply care about them. The costumes and ship itself look simply magnificent and are a wonder to look at. The end scene as well where the old Rose dies in her sleep and has the happy memory of marrying Jack on Titanic and when he dies in the water made me cry my eyes out and is one of the best scenes I have ever seen in film. Titanic is a epic film and James Cameron has shown this disaster in all it's horror and is a tribute to the victims of this tragedy. In 2012 there has been a rumour that he is going to re-release the film in 3D. It will be even more incredible no doubt (he proved that with Avatar) but it's the storytelling,which will recapture the myth of this fascinating tale that has been told throughout world generations. Even now as one reviewer Baybee from Austrailia quotes about Titanic the film.'This would have to be one of the most wonderful films of the 20th century and one that will never be forgotten'I couldn't have put it better myself. Even after watching this time after time the film still has that powerful impact of making me feel sad. Truly remarkable.",10,5,10,11 April 2010
Rocky III," Disappointing compared to the first two, but still entertaining showing Rocky hasn't run out of steam yet.
","Rocky III starts of tremendously with a marvellous montage of where Rocky II left with his rematch fight with Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) as Rocky (Stallone) has become the heavyweight champion of the world. The montage shows Rocky with his career growing over five years as we see him defending his title ten times undefeated. Cut to his new life. He and his wife Adrian and along with there son have moved to an even bigger house with Rocky suddenly maturing (wearing suits). He is enjoying the high-life. He decides to retire but new boxer climbing through the ranks Clubber Lang (Mr.T) challenges Rocky to defend his title, he agrees after Clubber taunts him, but he loses his title as his coach Mickey dies of a heart attack (Buregess Meredith). Rocky feels he has a lost apart of himself but with help from an unexpected friend Creed trains Rocky to reclaim his title from Lang.This is an entertaining third movie in the series and is about twenty minutes shorter. The tone of the third has changed from the first two. Rocky III now just concentrates on more the boxing and as a result Talia Shire as Adrian (whilst her acting is still good and she looks better than ever) her role is severely reduced where she now just appears in most scenes without talking. Though on the beach she gives her husband a passionate speech. Also Rocky Junior dosen't get much screen time, so you don't feel a bond between the family and as a result you lose the most of the touching and heartwarming moments that were apparent in the first two and that is where I felt Rocky III went wrong. Also the story isn't much different and it's started to feel slightly repetitive with the script feeling old-school now.However Stallone delivers a great performance again and so does Burgess Meredith in his unfortunately last appearance as Micky with a heartbreaking moment when he passes away. Mr. T as Clubber Lang makes a fearsome challenge with a delightful evil performance by him. One thing I did like was that Carl Weathers as Creed (who plays his part well) has a bigger role in this one. You see him and Rocky start to bond as they become friends and that was nice to see. The end fight was well done and entertaining but it wasn't as exciting or inspirational as the first two. However Rocky III is an impressive instalment for a third movie and hopefully the fourth in the series can do just as well or better.",6,1,2,8 September 2010
In Time," A great concept, which potential was wasted as my time was in watching this.
","In Time directed by Andrew Niccol has a marvellous premise. The idea is that in a future society time is actually currency where the whole economy, in terms of work and day to day living is based on paying a time allocation each individual has (that is somehow etched in/onto their skin) which is normally 25 years. However if someone has the means of wealth they can extend their life indefinitely and live for centuries. There is a class divide whereas the working class would only typically live to twenty five years. Somehow time can be exchanged between people as well. Eventually when your time is up, you are terminated. The concept is original and interesting. As the film started I was asking all these questions, like why is the age you can only normally live to 25? Why and how was this society created? Is it based on time due to overpopulation? There are timekeepers throughout the film that manage and control time to keep the system working, but if people are allowed to exchange time, how is it policed? And how did this society based on a time society end up in a class divide? And why do those who live past twenty five not age?I was looking forward to the film exploring this idea in depth, in what I thought would be a intelligent and thought-provoking movie. Instead Niccol stupidly decides to skim over these important questions as though it is background noise and is obsessed with bringing to the forefront two main characters Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) who when his mum dies (Olivia Wilde) ends up gaining centuries of time given to him by a suicidal stranger. Mistakenly identified as murdering the man timekeeper Raymond (Cillian Murphy) goes after him. Will kidnaps a rich daughter of a man Slyvia (Amanda Seyfried) where they go on the run to try and bring down the capitalist system. The problem is these two characters are boring and are not worth the screen time to pay for watching. We don't come to care about these characters or root for them in anyway. Both Timberlake and Seyfried give awful performances, which is a pity from her as she has given some good ones in Mamma Mia, Chloe, Jennifer's Body and Letters to Juliet. Timberlake though is even worse, particularly in the pathetic scene, which he horrifically overacts when his mum dies. Niccol is intent on making us agonise over watching the 'romance' develop between him and Seyfried, which has no chemistry whatsoever. Even the action sequences, which is very little of is surprisingly boring and nothing we haven't seen before. I will admit it is stylish looking with some great special effects and cinematography. I did particularly like one scene where Will and Slyvia are in a room and arm wrestle with a guy for time, which was cleverly written and skillfully executed (that is the only scene by the way) and Cillian Murphy gives a good performance as does Olivia Wilde in her cameo role, but they cannot do much with a flat and poorly structured script. In the end we are left with a film that looks like it will deliver the goods in first class except it doesn't arrive at all. This film might look cool at first glance and looks like it will have a lot to say, but underneath it is just a hollow empty shell, which is more concerned with showing off babes and guns (I wouldn't have minded had the concept been explored). This film shamefully manipulates it's audience into wasting their time viewing this rubbish. I did mildly enjoy a few parts as it does have a few saving graces. By far it isn't the worst film I have seen this year. I would certainly grant it that reprieve. However it is the most disappointing, with a great concept that had potential ending up criminally wasted.",3,0,5,25 December 2011
Thor," Thor = a poor film, which became an agonising chore to watch and ends being a complete bore.
","WARNING: VOAF (Very Overrated Audience Film) has struck cinema in the form of Thor with a over-bloated 7.9 IMDb rating in what has been described as an 'epic' superhero film. The only epic thing about Thor is what a bore it was and where I felt myself drifting towards sleep halfway through. Seriously looking on here I shook my head with disbelief at the statistical ratings of nearly 40 per cent of ten out of ten and written reviews of a no less given rating of four (apart from one reviewer). The thing is I have to be honest with how I felt about this movie. I won't go into the plot really because other people on here have already given a synopsis and I can't be asked to waste my time writing one. Sufficed to say the story is very simplistic with no real twists and has all the usual clichés of the 'bad brother' and the 'damsel in distress' falling for the 'hero.' But hey this is not really much of a criticism as there are plenty of films out there that follow the same formula, but at least they were enjoyable like Spiderman or the Batman films, the old or new ones.What I will say that I did enjoy with this film, which stopped me giving this a turkey and ultimately becoming as worse as the truly dreadful I Am Number Four is the special effects, which I have to say were quite impressive. Some of the scenery was breathtaking, the 3D in certain scenes was well implemented and Anthony Hopkins gave a great performance. However these small positives are drowned into oblivion by the scale of terrible things about Thor. First off the rest of the performances are terrible across the board. Chris Hemsworth as Thor was ridiculously bad and just sounded like he wanted to be elsewhere. He might look the part in costume but he cannot act and didn't convince me for a second as the hero. This wasn't helped by the script, which made his character stupid (at first) but then he supposedly redeems himself. But for me he was just annoying as you don't come to care about him or any of the other characters. Tom Hiddleston as Thor's brother Loki carried no weight as the villain as he just sounded so dull and my Natalie Portman! She seems to have lost her brain since her extraordinary performance in Black Swan. She gives the most cringe-worthy and wooden performance out of the whole cast. She laughs like a hyena and smiles like a retarded idiot and I just wanted to slap her as she goes all luvy dubby eyed over Thor (what does she see in him!? There is no romantic chemistry between her and him whatsoever). All the other cast are just as bad in under-performing and again wishing like they were somewhere else and who could blame them with such a bad script. It carried no emotional weight or substance and was just dry and repetitive. All the characters are essentially cardboard cut outs with no depth (though some of the reviewers say there is!) so I didn't care about them. When Thor in one scene is supposedly killed, I kept wishing it would come true but it dosen't. There is very little action and even when there is the Michael Bay trait appears with you hardly being able to see what is happening because the camera is so close up with lack of continuity editing. Furthermore the 3D itself though impressively implemented in a few scenes was mostly bad. I could actually at certain points take off my 3D glasses and see where it was in 2D as there was no distorted image. It's as though Kenneth Branagh the director decided after a while he couldn't be asked to properly implement the entire film in 3D and thought 'well the audience won't notice.' Well he hasn't fooled me. If he thinks audiences are that gullible in that respect when it comes to poor 3D he's wrong. What makes me laugh though is that he in an interview said he added the comedy moments to make sure audiences didn't take the film seriously, but the comedy wasn't funny and the whole film literally had the tone of trying to be serious, which I think is part of it's big downfall for me. The scene where you think Thor dies and there is sad music is just for me sickeningly insincere. (A similar scene to one in I Am Number Four).When it comes down to it is that Thor is just another Hollywood glossy movie that pitches itself as delivering everything (but for most audience viewers it has) but really delivers nothing. Hollywood has duped us all and they should be ashamed of themselves. If you want to waste £7.80 or more if you see it in the evening or weekend on this travesty of a film, don't say I didn't warn you. You watch it as your own peril. The only saving grace surely for how awful this film is will be bought to light by the film critics when reviewed this Friday, which will hopefully help counterbalance the very overrated opinions of Thor from audience reviewers on here.",2,21,47,27 April 2011
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," The worst sequel (and in general) film I have ever seen.
","At last it's great to know that I'm not the only person who thinks Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a terrible movie. Those who previewed this film as awful or close to it actually have sense whilst those who loved it...well that's your choice.Micheal Bay as it goes for an incompetent director has to be one of the worst. Despite the overwhelming evidence from fans of the first film, action fans or just anyone else who happened too see this on this website that this sequel is utterly crap and that it was a flop with film critics. Bay says he dosen't care what anyone else thinks.This attitude he has displayed reveals everything about his character and the way this film has been portrayed.This sequel has made millions and has become one of the summer's biggest hits but it shouldn't be.The first one was brilliant with a clear story, decent enough acting with character development and a chance to see what was happening on screen. One big problem being the first of many is that target market the demographics are aiming is contradictory.For example Bay has claimed this is a family film, yet it's full of sexual innuendo like a small bot humping Megan Foxes leg, a female in disguise as a Decepticon if that is the right name has a tail come out of her arse and Fox herself with her boobs swaying as she runs.And this is meant to be for teenagers? Frankly it's degrading, insulting in particular for women and downright shallow, which brings me to this film's second cock up no character development.The script is a sham Megan Fox has nothing to say or do apart from running away from pointless explosions except to be a piece of eye candy. Whilst Shia LaBeouf who made the most of his part and whose acting was solid enough was stuck between a rock and a hard place. There was no chemistry between him and Fox. The idea when he says he loves her was nauseating. Meanwhile all the other characters like Sam Witwicky's parent's and the auto-bots including two sidekicks were there to provide comic relief unfortunately all they gave me was one massive headache and feelings total frustration with old, recycled and lame jokes.And don't even get me started with the camera-work, all over the place. Action sequences are meant to be entertaining but it's impossible to enjoy if you can't see what's going on, bots stomping about and explosions not knowing what bot was on whose side as I just didn't care.The editing is atrocious of where Fox arrives in Egypt likes she's in Paris one moment and bang she's now in Egypt as were several other parts which I can't be bothered to go into.The plot though thin in itself and very simple just dragged on forever making this two and a half hours, it was barely tolerable after the first hour.In th end Bay comes off to me as an arrogant man who just loves to make money. He shouldn't be allowed to make movies and I was astounded to learn that Steven Spielburg even took part in this film! Bay must have drugged him.In the end I just came out extremely disappointed and frustrated with one big headache. Now wheres the paracetamol?",1,3,12,6 October 2009
Love Actually," The best romcom of all time!
","Ten minutes into seeing this film I was enraptured. This is two hours and fifteen minutes of pure cinematic entertainment.Everyone who starred in this film and helped make it have to be commended for a tremendous achievement.First of all Richard Curtis the director enlarges on the theme of love with 9 short stories and 22 leading characters. The technique and discipline of cutting to each story is incredible. Which goes to say for me this is one of the best edited films I have seen. Credit goes to Nick Moore.The acting from all involved too name just a few Alan Rickman, Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Martine Mccutcheon, Emma Thompson, Kiera Knightely, Laura Linney, Thomas Sangster, Liam Neeson, Kris Marshall, Joanna Page and Martin Freeman is superb. Each character is convincingly believable and warm hearted in there roles.Also watch out for a hilarious cameo role from Rowan Atkinson. Love Actually because of so many stories and characters could have become confusing but due to the editing and there performances which makes them engaging and memorable. I never lost my way and cared about all the characters.The effect was charming, magical and cute. In particular Thomas Sangster who lusts after a girl at school and Joanna Page and Martin Freeman as the porno actors, which could have been sleazy and grubby, but because they act so professional with there occupations and are natural when getting to know one another made there romance sweet.The film makes you believe that they do love each other. Even the Sangston storyline.Curtis knows when to give the comic set pieces. Most credit to Bill Nighy and Kris Marshall, give the romantic escapism and to bring us back to reality in a dash as not all love has a happy ending.The cinematography by Micheal Coulter's is gorgeous by making London seem the love capital of the world.This film made me believe love exists and I came out of watching on TV with the biggest smile on my face. There are no criticisms for this film.It rightly deserved all the Oscars it scooped. One of the best films I have ever seen.",10,1,4,14 September 2009
Hancock," An unmemorable superhero
","Hancock was a film that had a lot of potential but it failed to impress me enough. It was a good attempt with the story but what started out as promising at the start run out of sugar later on as the story got too far fetched and i just found my enthusiasm for the film ebbing away as later on another storyline emerged of a past romance with his ability as a superhero, the film found it difficult nearer the end to find a balance between the two Will Smith put in a decent performance as he does in most films and he made the audience where I was watching this film laugh in places with some decent action, but even he couldn't save this bore of a film. Disappointing as I was expecting a lot more.",5,1,4,18 December 2008
Inception," Inception marks a new era in film-making. Intellectually engaging and terrifically entertaining.
","Inception is the new sci-fi movie that has taken America and Britain by storm. In the US alone on it's first weekend of release, it engrossed a staggering $60.4 million dollars and is currently top of the box office around the world. This movie has been hyped up beyond anything I have ever known in magnitude. Plenty of friends I know in America informed me of the same adjectives used to describe this movie 'incredible' 'unbelivable' 'terrfic' and common phrases associated with it like 'Christopher Nolan is a god film-maker' and with the film in general 'the best film ever' etc. Usually I typically associate these adjectives and 'the best film ever' phrase with a lot of movies I have had the pleasure of viewing over the years. But to describe it with the adjectives listed above is an understatement. There are no words that can reiterate how this film is. Just using all the adjectives to describe something you like will have to do. Usually when a film like Inception is hyped, I get swarmed along with it. You just cannot help it, it's like the institution of cinema has an overwhelming attraction to you that you give in to see films like Inception. I would certainly rate Inception in terms of how amazing it is up there with Titanic, Avatar and The Lord of the Rings trilogies.Christopher Nolan, I knew nothing of his work before he reinvigorated the Batman franchise. With Batman Begins he did this very well but the Dark Knight as those who will know have looked at my review on it, I found it bitterly disappointing to say the least though I was the minority in arguing this. But most directors have their successes and failures and after Inception Nolan truly deserves to join the other Hollywood King of directors like James Cameron, Steven Spielburg, Clint Eastwood and Peter Jackson. This is Nolan's masterpiece.To start the basic story is that Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCapario) a highly skilled thief at extracting ideas from an individual's subconscious whilst they are dreaming is a fugitive after he lost everything he loved and is given the chance to go back to his children if he pulls off one last heist of implanting an idea in Robert Fischer's mind (Cillian Murphy) to bring down an empire run originally by his dad. Cobb ensembles a team of experts, which includes an architect that designs the world of the dream, Ariadne (Ellen Juno) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon Levitt). The idea to bring the empire down is to pull off Inception, a supposed impossible dream system, which involves creating a dream within a dream within a dream, basically three dream layers, which is impossible to maintain before the dreamer wakes up in real state. Meanwhile a back story that does though come into conjunction with the main plot later on is Cobb's visions of seeing his wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) where his memories of her interrupt the dream state. Watch as events unfold before you as from the first scene, this is truly a movie you need both your eyes, ears and mind to see. It is stunning visually as the idea of controlling one dreams with different layout's and shapes takes effect. Never has architecture seem so fascinating. Watching it is like art, creative, textured and multi-layered exactly like a dream. Trying to make your brain function at trying to understand the complexity of the multi-layered dreams in the story is simplified, but you have to pay attention. This film is literally perfect. The acting from DiCaprio is brilliant and just like the excellent Shutter Island, he deserves an Oscar nomination. Terrific support comes from Murphy, Juno, Levitt and Cotillard who flex out their roles and make the most of it. Sir Micheal Caine gives a superb tiny cameo of only being on the screen for a few minutes.Nolan appreciates that story and character and plot development is as important as visual style and action, with the action being plenty of and choreographed incredibly making it terrifically exciting. Each character has depth particularly Cobb and there are extremely inventive camera shots and angles that Nolan uses with a gorgeous cinematography, a stunning music score and a cracking ending that leaves you to draw your own conclusions. It reminds me of Mulholland Drive with dreams and reality.Nolan has created a movie that will have impact on every film maker to come and Inception will become a classic. Film enthusiasts and critics will be analysing this for years. Truly a remarkable and stupendous achievement for Nolan who has come up with an original and refreshing story idea. All film departments perform immaculately like a well oiled machine and I wouldn't bet for me on this being the best film of the year for me. The 9.3 of the IMDb rating is well justified. It's two and half hours this film, but they fly by. One of the greatest and surely iconic and influential film's of our time in over a hundred years of cinema. I can't give it more praise than that except to say I loved Inception!",10,9,20,21 July 2010
Lord of War," Manages to be both entertaining and informative at the same time.
","Nicolas Cage gives a great performance as Yuri Orlov who develops a talent for selling guns as he becomes an arms dealer. Along the way his brother joins him and he falls in love with a model. This is a funny and often informative film about the consequences of guns that are used in conflicts Yuri makes big money from selling his guns as he lies to his wife about what he is up to. Things become difficult when another arms dealer Simeon Weisz, played well by Ian Holm (Bilbo Baggins in Lord of the Rings) goes against him, a terrorist leader in Africa buys his pocket and does not let him retire and the presence of an interpol cop (Ethan Hawke). Orlov isn't really a likable character and he gets his comeuppance at the end with consequences that are severe (which I won't say about) as he sells weapons that go in the hands of children and he cheats on his wife, but somehow through Cage's charm and his predicament, he becomes likable. Lord of War is nothing special but it is an interesting exploration of the culture of arms dealing and is entertaining to watch also with some great laughs. The only thing I would say is that him and the model (whoever the actress is lack chemistry) but that's only a small gripe. Overall it's a great film to watch.",7,0,1,29 June 2010
The Blind Side," A truly inspirational and heartwarming true story.
","The Blind Side stars Sandra Bullock as mum Leigh Anne Tuohy and her husband Sean Tuohy played by Tim McGraw who take in a young black lad Michael Oher played by Quinton Aaron who lives in a rundown neighbourhood with his mum whose is on drugs and he himself who struggles at school but is great at sports. Leigh and Sean spot Quinton out at night in the rain and take him in. Here he gets a better life as the Tuohy's live in a large house and end up treating him like their own son with the mother of Michael who lets her son go. From here the Tuohy's encourage Micheal to be more confident in himself and help him improve his grades at school and encourage him to pursue American football as he wants to enter the NFL professionally.This is similar to Clint Eastwood's Invictus of telling a true story and being inspirational, the difference is there wasn't enough for me with Invictus, but The Blind Side is a different story. My dad took me to see this at the cinema and I wasn't expecting to like it much, but I kept an open mind and settled in my seat with my popcorn and drink and within fifteen minutes I was engrossed so much I forgot I had popcorn or that I was even at the cinema! This is the movie Invictus should have been. The viewer is taken on a fascinating journey of love, sadness and inspiration. Sandra Bullock for me has always been a good actress but one that never really stood out from the crowd, but she deserved her Oscar for this. Her acting was absolutely outstanding, it was nothing short of sensational, other actors like Tim McGraw and Kathy Bates as Michael's home tutor give good support and Quinton Aaron, though he dosen't speak much, he had a child-like innocence and charm that won me over.I was kept gripped by the whole 130 minutes of this movie and at the end it was one of those rare movies that I hated to see end. I could have happily sat there for another hour watching it. In the end this was a very inspirational and heartwarming true story that was excellently told and acted.",10,0,2,9 August 2010
Rango," An intelligent animation western that partially fulfilled it's potential.
","Rango (voiced by Johnny Depp) is an ordinary chameleon who ends up in the town of Dirt, a lawless outpost in the Wild West who are looking for a new sheriff and Rango fulfils that position. The occupants of the town have little water which is obviously essential to their survival and of what there is, is stolen from the bank so Rango with the help of various townsfolk goes to retrieve it back.Overall this is an intelligent movie with plenty of western pastiche and parodies that is referenced. But this is part of the problem, the movie becomes too intelligent and a bit self indulgent in wanting to cram in so many western references and as a result I just don't think this is a movie many kids will enjoy or anyone who has seen many westerns like me. And as a result for me though it was funny in parts and I chuckled now and again there just wasn't enough laughs for me really and it felt dragged out at certain points. At a hundred minutes it was a bit too long. If they cut off ten minutes and included more laughs instead of so many references my rating of this would have been higher. And whilst I'm still going on the negatives you enjoy watching the characters but don't end up emotionally connecting with them not like in Up or in any of the Toy Story films. And it did start off a bit boring and slow. But it does pick up when Rango enters Dirt Town.However at the risk of sounding so negative there was plenty other things in this film that I admired, which made me enjoy it. Though not as big on laughs, the script is witty and crackles with sharpness making it a joy throughout. The voice-over acting was superb across the cast. Johnny Depp was good as the voice of Rango, but the best ones were Isla Fisher as the voice of Beans (who gave an excellent wild west accent) and I really enjoyed Bill Nighy's turn as the voice of rattlesnake Jake. It is superbly well shot and edited by director Gore Verbinski. Surprisingly the action sequences are very entertaining, which did to some extent make up for some of the lack of comedy. But the best thing was the animation, which looked absolutely gorgeous to visualise it, particularly in digital. I also highly admire Gore Verbinski's decision not to add this in 3D, though it can be extremely well done in films and animations like Up, Rango just proves you don't need 3D to enjoy the visual animation. I also like Verbinki's creativeness at trying something different. A western animation as far as I am aware isn't very common, which makes it quite original.In the end though Rango didn't completely fulfil it's potential as it is a bit too self indulgent I enjoyed it thoroughly and can certainly see why this has been such a huge hit with audiences. The 7.8 IMDb rating on here is I feel about right. This is worth seeing if your an adult or have a fondness for the western genre. Rango is overall an intelligent animation that is worth a watch and despite it flaws it deserves high praise and it is one of the most original animations to come out in recent years. Very enjoyable entertainment.",7,1,4,23 March 2011
X-Men: First Class," These X-Men live up to their title. It's first class all the way!
","Like many audience members of Hollywood cinema, I am a big fan of the X- Men franchise, despite having never read the comics. The first two films in 2000 and 2003 were massive hits and I loved them. But then tragically X-Men 3: The Last Stand made an unwelcome appearance on our screens in 2006. For me it was one of the worst superhero movies I had encountered and this is where like many franchises that do sequels, by the third most have been wrung out and I thought X-Men has run it's course. But then thankfully in 2009, director Gavin Hood decided to do a prequel of mutant Wolverine, which I really enjoyed and restored my faith in the franchise in what I thought was broken.When initially I heard there was going to be a fifth X-Men with the origins of Magneto and Charles Xaiver I was excited and even more so when I heard it was a prequel/reboot, where after First Class, there is a commission for two more. I looked at the reviews on here and was taken aback at how hyped up this movie was. I will be honest I was a bit sceptical after recent films that I have seen at the pictures I have seen that have been hyped up and been for me highly over-rated, one being the terrible superhero movie Thor. However I am more than pleased to say X-Men First Class lives up to it's reputation by the audience and fulfilled it's title by being first class all the way. I would say it is the best superhero movie of this year and arguably the best I have seen since Batman Begins (2005 and yes even better than The Dark Knight!). One thing I was very pleased about with this X-Men film is the choice of director Matthew Vaughn who from Kick-Ass appreciates that character substance and plot development is as important as the action sequences and special effects and X-Men First Class is the same. Coming in at 132 minutes, Matthew Vaughn impressively has packed a lot in with the story that is balanced well consisting of different mutants coming together like Eric/Magneto (Michael Fassbender), Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), Hank McCoy/Beast (Nicholas Hoult), Sean Cassidy/Banshee (Caleb Landry Jones) and Alex Summers/Havok (Lucas Till) headed by Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) who is supported by human CIA agent Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne). They are against the other mutants, who include Emma Frost (January Jones), Janos Quested/Riptide (Alex Gonzalez), Azazel (Jason Flemyng) and Angel Salvadore (Zoe Kravitz, who changes sides from Xavier's to Shaw's) who are headed by Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). They have to stop him from using the Russians to start a war against humans by disguising it through the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. Meanwhile another plot that is prevalent throughout is Eric's desire for revenge against Shaw who was his creator of his powers and who killed his mother with a sub plot of a potential romance between Raven and Beast.The things that were great about this film that I expected was the superb special effects (I was also pleased that Vaughn decided not to do this in 3D), the action sequences were beautifully choreographed and were enormously destructive and exciting (though just as a little small gripe, I wish there had been a bit more action) and the script though basic did have flashes of wit with some nice comedy (with a small, but fantastic cameo appearance by Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, who gets a great one liner).The biggest strength though is the character substance and plot development and the acting. The characters of all the different mutants are set up nicely as we learn about their different abilities and they all get their moments to shine. There are great performances across the board particularly by Bacon as Shaw who had a subtle but sharp malevolence, January Jones as Emma Frost and Jennifer Lawrence as Raven, but the driving force behind the plot development is Fassbender and McAvoy. They both give excellent performances as Xavier and Eric with some great chemistry on screen. You can clearly see the pain in Eric's eyes as he is consumed with his desire for revenge as all he has known all his life is pain and anger (which helps use his powers) in contrast to Xavier's (a comfortable and painless lifestyle who is smart and quick witted but with a gentle nature). Throughout Vaughn cleverly distinguishes through the dialogue and actions of the two, the differing ideologies and objectives that they both contain as alliances are formed and broken and mutants switch sides. Throughout this divide is apparent as Eric tells Xavier that they as mutants will never be accepted by humans and that they should form their own society and rise to rid the world of humanity (mirroring Shaw's desires), whereas Charles wants to protect them and hopes one day they can co-exist side by side peacefully. The only reason Eric stays alongside Charles is to kill Shaw as they need to stop him. This divide in mutant/human existence ideology is cleverly mirrored in the sub-plot romance between Raven and Beast when Raven wants to be seen for who she is, but Beast wants to look normal like humans.In the end Vaughn has created a film that will appeal to all who are new to the franchise and are loyal fans of the older films. He understands specifically what the audience expected and he delivered. And the fact he can intuitively guess what audiences wants is what I think partly makes this such a success. As I said they are going to make this prequel/reboot a new franchise and to that I say yes please as X-Men First Class is really that brilliant.",10,8,16,9 June 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight Rises above and beyond to Perfection. A Monumentally Epic End to Nolan's Trilogy.
","Nolan's reboot of the Batman franchise has finally come to an end in this trilogy consisting of Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises. I loved Batman Begins with it's perfect balance of blending Batman's origins with the action. It was the first Batman movie, where for me, Batman was as interesting and engaging to watch as his adversary. When it came to The Dark Knight as those who read my review on that, which I will revise shortly, I wasn't that keen on it unlike the majority. I can understand why people loved it. That's fair enough. For me though were some large flaws to it and even though I enjoyed it, it didn't rise up to the first one's accomplishments. Then The Dark Knight Rises came along and blew away any misconceptions I had of Nolan completing this trilogy. Hands down as most audience reviewers have reiterated, this is definitely the best movie of the year so far and far surpasses The Dark Knight and even Batman Begins to be the best of this trilogy. As the saying goes, they save the best until last.Even though this was two and a three quarter hours, the time flew by and I loved every minute of it. Picking up from The Dark Knight, this third film is set eight years later where both Bruce Wayne and Batman have all but disappeared from the world as Batman has been outlawed by the police and the people of Gotham because they believed he killed Harvey Dent. Meanwhile Wayne Enterprises is starting to fall and he gives board member Miranda (Marion Cotillard) responsibility of leading the organisation. Eventually Bruce (Christian Bale) decides he wants some fresh air and goes out where he is still tormented by memories of losing Rachel Dawes and the death of Harvey Dent. Whilst Bruce suffers and Alfred tries to help him (Sir Michael Caine), Selina/Catwoman (Anne Hathaway) comes into Wayne's life by posing as a maid to steal his mother's pearls and eventually teams up with Batman against Batman's new adversary Bane (Tom Hardy) who comes to Gotham with the plan to destroy it by carrying out Ras Al Ghal's legacy. Eventually Batman returns and with the aid of Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) Officer Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Fox (Morgan Freeman) and Catwoman, they form a plan to stop Bane from destroying Gotham.Nolan brings together the story threads from the first two Batman movies and ties them beautifully into the conclusion. He is skilfully adept at conveying the loneliness and rage that Bruce feels in isolation away from the people of Gotham. As he struggles to deal with the demons of his past to rise up again and reclaim a normal life as Alfred wants him to, he dons the cape one last time. Bale gives his most best performance to date as either Bruce and the caped crusader. Through his movement and facial expressions you can see the pain in his eyes and beyond into his soul with a man scarred with a painful past. Thankfully when Bale transforms into Batman, the annoying growl of a voice he had in The Dark Knight is blessedly diminished. Tom Hardy as Bane is Batman's most fearsome adversary to date with him having the build and acting to pull off a brilliant performance. Bane turns Gotham into absolute chaos (like the Joker) but in a more daring and convincing way. Hardy's voice behind his mask is cold and calculating, which sent shivers up my spine. There have been complaints by film critics that Bane's dialogue behind the mask is inaudible a lot of the time. Maybe they need to get their ears checked because I heard every word he said. Each word and nuance carried weight and he owned the role. Hathaway as well has received a fair amount of criticism as Catwoman, but she carries the role with great sophistication and it is definitely one of her best performances. Gordon-Levitt, Freeman, Caine and Oldman all transcend in their roles. Also special mention must go to Marion Cotillard as Miranda who though her screen time is limited makes the most of her scenes.The story is terrifically orchestrated, with a great twist that I didn't see coming. Though I know it's from the original comics, I haven't read them so it was new to me. The special effects were amazing and I loved The Bat as well. The actions sequences were excellently choreographed and superbly tense and entertaining to watch. Nolan wonderfully intermixes all these characters that we care about and the film never loses site of itself as the action and story is balanced perfectly together. And at the end of the movie I was jumping for joy for a staggering achievement that Nolan has achieved for this trilogy, particularly this last one. There's no harm in betting that this will win plenty of Oscars and it is well deserved. Every aspect of The Dark Knight Rises is impeccably placed. Batman really does rise on this occasion and sends the trilogy out with a bang. This is well worth seeing, even if you didn't think much of the second like me, the hype this time is well justified.

Iron Man," The birth of a new superhero
","Robert Downey Junior plays Tony Stark a rich billionaire of Stark Industries who is kidnapped in Afghanistan. He builds a metal suit to escape and ends up deciding to fight crime with his Iron suit calling himself Iron Man.Iron Man is a great film, though not quite as terrific as the first two Spiderman's or Batman Begins (but certainly better than The Dark Knight). It has a great story some terrific action and special effects and Downey Jr just revels in his role of enjoyment bringing wit to an already decent script and humour. Terrence Howard as Rodney provides good support and Jeff Bridges as the villain Obadiah Stane is great. A terrific film this is as the story of how Stark wants and why he becomes Iron Man is built up nicely making him a more interesting character (similar to why Bruce Wayne in Batman Begins wanted and how he became Batman). This gives the story substance and the film intelligence and you actually care about Stark. I didn't love Iron Man, but I really did enjoy it. It's a pity the second didn't do as well, but this dosen't tarnish the first one's reputation. A new hero has been born.",8,0,1,2 May 2010
Blade Runner," The worst sci-fi of all time.
","Blade Runner has been hailed as a true classic, though when it came out it was blasted at the box office. It was seen as too complex particularly the ending, which was why it was simplified. But over time it has been seen as the iconic sci-fi film of the 1980s.I saw this a few years ago, the director's cut version on DVD and I have to say this film was awful. I found it far too complex but even then I still wouldn't like it. I found it very depressing, overlong and tedious with just endless talking.Though I did like the story from what I could discern from it and Harrison Ford's acting is commendable, but even he couldn't save this. A film I won't see again and I hate but I'm probably in the minority in saying that.",1,50,109,26 December 2009
RED," Not as good as it could have been, but still enjoyable fun.
","I haven't been to the cinema much recently as for me there hasn't really be many films out that have caught my attention. The last film I saw at the pictures was the impressive The Town directed by Ben Affleck that I saw in late September. Red I saw in a trailer prior to that and it looked like terrific fun and was a film I was very much looking forward to. The 7.7 IMDb rating on this film in my opinion is a little extravagant and isn't really justified. It's for me hard to avoid the conclusion that the director Robert Schwentke just placed all the fun moments in the trailer for the sake of drawing the audience to the cinema in a way, but it isn't entirely true.The basic story starts off with ex-CIA agent Frank Mose's chats on the phone to Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker) whom have a thing for each other when Frank is attacked by CIA operatives who attempt to kill him. He hooks up with Sarah and other retired CIA agents along the way, which include Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman), Victoria (Helen Mirren), Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich) and Ivan Simonov (Brian Cox) to try and find out why their own government wants to kill them. Whilst the CIA appoint operative William Cooper (Karl Urban) to apprehend Frank.The story is quite basic and the screenplay is functional at best, whilst there are some funny moments, the script isn't witty or sharp enough and that's where the film loses it's edge. There were moments particularly in the first forty minutes where the movie threatens to be dragged down by it's slow pace and mediocre script, but the film does pick up and get better later even if things get a little silly. In terms of the acting, Willis gives an okay performance, but I was a bit disappointed to be honest. He tries to sparkle but he just couldn't and it felt very run of the mill, whilst Malkovich has a few decent comic moments, but Freeman and Mirren hold themselves much better with more spark in their eyes and wittiness in the projection of the dialogue they speak. They sounded like they were enjoying themselves. Karl Urban does solidly well for his more serious supporting role, but the best person in this was Mary Parker as Sarah. She was terrific as a woman living a normal life but coming to grips that the man she like is a CIA agent and becomes immersed in his world. The action was great and smoothly handled and the music was very good. The style as well was handled nicely as to some extent trying to be cool.Red has been compared to the terrible The Expendables, which is similar in terms of story retired soldiers coming against their own government, but that is where the similarities end. As Red is much better than that trash. Maybe this wasn't as good as it could have been, but it's entertaining enough and is worth seeing. I wouldn't say no to seeing it again, but I would only rent it out on DVD, not see at the pictures or buy it. Saying that it's an enjoyable enough ride and should satisfy anyone's need for harmless entertainment.",6,28,45,23 October 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Magnificent and a monumental epic end to this much love franchise of books and films that has been a part of millions of people lives for the last fourteen years.
","When the first Harry Potter book came out the 30th June 1997, no one not even JK Rowling herself could have predicted the storm that would follow as millions of people of all ages from the young to the elderly fell in love with the fictional character of Harry Potter along with Ron, Hermione and all the other characters throughout the seven book series. Told in books, played through computer games and now turned into movies with websites, forums and fan clubs based on 'the boy who lived,' Harry Potter has become an iconic symbol of British/world culture with the values of trust, honesty, friendship, love and courage lots of human beings show everyday. The character has been and will continue to enrich all our lives for pure enjoyment for generations to come as well as being a terrific role model for younger kids.Part I of the Deathly Hallows was brilliant at conveying the burden and isolation Harry, Ron and Hermione felt. Part II promises heart stopping action on an epic scale and it delivers. We see the trio try and find and destroy the remainder of Voldemort's Horcruxes as they break into Gringotts and Hogwarts where battle takes place with student/teachers against Voldemort's army of Death Eaters, Trolls and Spiders. The acting is brilliant all round as everyone gets their moment to shine like Maggie Smith as McGonagall, Gary Lewis as Neville Longbottom and Julie Walters as Molly Weasley. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson pull off their best performances since the beginning of the franchise. But it's Radcliffe who I think steals the film with his most believable performance yet. All three deserve to go on to more things with their acting career as they truly deserve it from learning to adapt and grow from film to film with their acting. However the other stars cannot be ignored with Ralph Fiennes being truly menacing as Voldemort who gets more screen time, Alan Rickman as Snape, Helen Boham Carter as Bellatrix, Micheal Gambon as Dumbledore and Gary Oldman as Sirius amongst other actors all get their moments to shine.The special effects are better than ever with a truly realistic dragon at Gringotts and the design set pieces of Diagon Alley, Gringotts and Hogwarts. It was also quite good in 3D, which was very well implemented. The script as well had it's sharp moments producing some comic bits when Herminone tries to act like Bellatrix at Gringotts and some heartfelt moments when Fred and Lupin and Tonks die. This brings me on to the action, which truly is spectacular and choreographed superbly on a massive scale. The best bits of the fight and most exciting though being when Harry and Voldemort face each other after the forest and when Ron, Hermione and Neville conspire together to kill Nagini. The narrative as well by Steve Knowles is held together quite well as the important story strands are tied beautifully into the conclusion. Of course it still is a bit patchy from previous films and the editing is a bit choppy like Molly Weasley amongst other characters suddenly appear out of Hogwarts from nowhere and some of the last battle sequence for a small part it is a bit hard to make out what is happening on the screen. But this is only a small gripe compared to it's overall achievement as I liked the part of Snape's memories, which was well done and the last sequence of nineteen years later when Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny have grown up with their children bought a tear to my eye as it is really quite beautifully done. This film is the best of the lot and truly does justice to the books and ends a much loved and will be missed franchise that has entranced millions. Thank you JK Rowling and all the actors and directors of all the film particularly David Yates for the last three films (and superbly directed this last part) for giving us many wonderful years of enjoyment and entertainment. Harry Potter is a legacy that will be passed on through telling of the stories and watching the films as generations to come will immerse themselves in the world of Harry and Hogwarts. To that I say farewell to Harry and all. These characters will all be greatly missed by lots of people including me.",10,0,2,16 July 2011
Final Destination," The best of the four no doubt!
","With three sequels under it's belt and two main directors James Wong who did FD 1 and 3 and David Ellis who did 2 and 4. The Final Destination franchise has been an enjoyable one. The first is of the best no doubt. As a general occurrence in Hollywood movies whatever the genre the first if there are sequels will always be the best though some in recent years has reversed that assumption like Spiderman 2 and Lethal Weapon 2.Here though the first one is the best. James Wong directs this with skill and ease. He clearly knows his target demographics for this film horror fans and a teenage audience of fifteen years to early twenties. This being the case as all the main characters apart from one are teenagers. Looking at some of the reviews here FD has been highly criticised for a lot of aspects, which is fair enough as everyone has there own opinion. But let me tell you why this movie I give deserves a nine.First off the deaths are extremely inventive, there is plenty of gore so those with a weak stomach wouldn't like this. With the sequels the deaths though still gruesome aren't very scary and you more tended to laugh, but with the first one there are some genuinely scary moments that did throw me off balance like when the bus kills Terry Chaney (played by Amanda Detmer), that just scared the crap out of me. Also the start with the plane crashing in Alex's premonition had me on edge and arguably the scariest scene of the movie was when Alex and Clear go to see Todd's dead body and they run into the mortician played excellently by Tony Todd. Throughout there is plenty of suspense and tension helped by great music in whether the characters will survive. Also what is rare with your average horror flicks is any emotional connection to the characters. I cared about Alex and Clear and as they become a couple I hoped they would survive and Carter I hated him! Though the script and dialogue was a bit rubbish, it's easily forgiven. The acting is to a good standard particularly Devon Sawa as Alex and Ali Larter as Clear Rivers. The story is also original and different, which makes it refreshing and the ending is great. In referring to the ending I also loved the soundtrack when the credits rolled up. It was great. The special effects though obviously they would look bad now was good for it's time.That's why I think FD is a brilliant movie and deserves such a high rating and even though with each sequel they have been getting worse. FD will never lose it's touch and will remain for me the best of the franchise.",9,1,2,11 April 2010
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," An astonishing achievement for the Twilight film series! A very enjoyable addition to it!
","My goodness! I never thought I would be saying this! But I actually really enjoyed Eclispe! This coming from a guy years ago who couldn't stand the first one! I saw the second New Moon at university because lots of friends who were girls beg me to see it with them at the film society and I mildly enjoyed it.Since writing the review for New Moon. I have taken to reading the books. I wanted to partly see if it was just the making of the two films that was the problem of why they were bad or that the books were the cause, well it was the films. The books are immensely enjoyable, the best for me being Breaking Dawn. In the books the chemistry between Edward and Bella is there, but that has been missing completely from the movies. And even Bella's happiness of smiling and laughing in the book was never apparent in either film.I think since New Moon, the new director David Slade has made huge improvements and he has to be commended. The first of the improvements which I have been hoping for was improvement in the acting of Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson as Bella and Edward because in Twilight and New Moon they couldn't act. They mumbled there lines, sounded dull and bored with zip chemistry between them. But I'm amazed and very pleased to say, their acting has improved! Kristen has come the furthest. She had injected more emotion into her voice when delivering her lines and I can for the first time actually believe she cares about Edward. She also smiled and laughed! Something else that has been missing from the films that were apparent in the first two books. There were times where Stewart did fall flat of delivering her lines as her acting was still very bad in places, but she has improved and has at least stopped along with Pattinson the annoying habit of pausing before finishing a sentence, which brings me on to Pattinson. He has become better in his acting too. The anguish he felt at certain points in the film where Bella is in danger was clear and it made me feel sorry for him. Also the argument between him and Jacob was tense. He still delivers a lots of his lines deadpanned, but there were instances like Stewart where he injected more believability into his role.What has also helped these two actors more is the scriptwriters. The dialogue is even less cheesy than New Moon (though there were still parts that were) and thankfully as mentioned flows naturally without any awkward pauses. Furthermore for the first time there was actually romantic chemistry between Bella and Edward, something that had been seriously lacking and had been desperately needed in the last two movies. When they are kissing in the meadow or Edward's bed. The chemistry was electric, which was something I wasn't expecting. Slade wisely uses extreme close up shots to show this.Other parts of the film like the special effects were stunning as the other actors and actresses like Taylor Lautner who plays Jacob, like Xavier Samuel as Riley or Bryce Howard as Victoria did well in their supporting roles. The action sequences and there was more that made me like it even more was choreographed superbly, the scenery was stunning, the music was also nice, there were some good moments of comedy like when Jacob kisses Bella and she punches him in the nose and gets a broken hand for it was funny and I also liked the story more than the others. In terms of relating it to the books I have to say David Slade did a great job keeping in the essence of the story going (considering I thought Eclispe was the weakest book) even though scenes were cut out. Normally like the majority of others on IMDb I would severely criticise this film, but I cannot accommodate them this time. I agree with the few on here who have given this a higher rating. Improvements still need to be made particularly with Stewart and Pattinson, but they should be proud of themselves for doing better and I am glad there acting is improving along with some great chemistry with the characters. David Slade has made the franchise come in leaps and bounds and has to be commended for a terrific achievement. I look forward to Breaking Dawn with high hopes it will be even better. My expectations for the franchise has just been raised. I recommend Eclispe as a great summer film. I for one thoroughly enjoyed it.",7,5,12,5 July 2010
Jackie Brown," Oh dear Tarantino what have you done?
","First off let me say that I am a big QT fan. I have seen all his other films like Resevior Dogs, Unlucky Romance, Kill Bill 1 and 2, Pulp Fiction and Inglorious Basterds etc. Though I knew Jackie Brown was different that it wasn't as violent hence the 15 certificate and that there was more deeper characterisation and plot development, which isn't what QT does I was still intrigued and was looking forward to my weekly film lecture at uni as this was the film that was screening.It pains me to give this such a low rating. Yes there is some great dialogue with superb music and the acting is great with some moments of comic relief but it's far too long! I didn't necessarily expect action all the way through but there was barely anything. All there was just talking, rambling all the characters and going into to deep analysis about them when there didn't need to be.The plot was simple but Tarantinio just drags it out. I don't mind deeper character development but there has to be a balance. This dosen't have it. The usual sparkle and pace we have come to expect from Tarantino was gone from this film, but thankfully since with Inglorious Basterds, which I loved, he has reverted back to his original formula.It's a brave attempt by QT to make a different type of film and it can work but not in this case and by the end I came out just not caring about any of the characters and what happened to them and it's a pity with such a star cast of Robert De Niro, Samuel L Jackson and Brigit Fonda that they were wasted.But despite this setback for QT he's still a superb director whose allowed one little slip up. Lets just hope he continues to stick to the formula and dosen't attempt to make a film like this again because it wouldn't work.",2,3,9,14 December 2009
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," The Transformers franchise still has a few flaws, but Dark of the Moon is a decent addition to the franchise and an enjoyable summer blockbuster overall.
","I enjoyed Transformers in 2007 and rated it on here a 8/10. I was really looking forward to Transformers 2 and despite the negative reviews I went to see it and was appalled at how awful it was with the most cringe-worthy dialogue and acting. The jokes were immature, offensive and became extremely dull and repetitive with two 'jip and hive' Autobots who were really annoying. This made the film over-bloated with an in-exhaustible length of two and a half hours. It had shameful ethnic stereotyping of a couple of the human cameo characters and the women namely Megan Fox was just on show for eye candy (which would be no problem had she been able to act and had some interesting character traits.) The biggest problems I had though was the camera and editing, with when it came to the action the camera was switching so fast and edited so frenetically it was impossible to comprehend what was happening to the humans or robots making the action (which would have been the movies biggest asset) a bore too.Anyway my friend against all resistance from me managed to persuade me to see Dark of the Moon and in 3D and I have to say I was extremely sceptical and groaned inwardly when I saw the length was two and a half hours. Two others things I wanted Bay to improve on was cutting down on the jokes and making them less offensive and the camera/editing of the action sequences.I went in and sat down. I will say that the first ten minutes before Sam Witwicky (La Beouf) and Carly, Sam's new girlfriend (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) turned up in her apartment was fantastic. Bay cleverly inter-cuts with real life and archived footage the achievement of Man's landing on the Moon in 1969. It was very interesting to watch. Unfortunately after that for the next forty five-fifty minutes Bay introduces nothing but pointless scenes, which should have been left on the cutting floor of cliché and boring jokes and even though he said he would tone down on it, he really hasn't as there are two small Autobots who try to act cool, but really they're just annoying. What's more the jokes are still really insulting with a few homophobic and racist jokes, particularly of one Asian character Jerry Wang who is so obviously stereotyped with the way he acts. We are also meant to laugh because he dies. Seriously any Asian's or guys that are gay who watch this and find it offensive have every right to feel that way. As ethnic/social groups they are consistently marginalised in most mainstream Hollywood movies as it does not fit into the ideal Conservative American Ideology. The thing is with Bay though is he makes it so obvious and uses it for cheap laughs, which is just cruel he might as well have it tattooed on his forehead for all the world to see. At least other directors that do stereotype don't make it as offensive and achieve it more subtly. Anyway where Bay has toned down the comedy well is the appearance of Sam's annoying and dim-witted parents Ron and Judy who are in it for less than ten minutes, though they could have been cut out all together. The plot is simple but too overextended for it's length with the narrative being incoherent, a bad script with more cringe dialogue and acting bad from some but from Whitely being the worst. She is a model and looks fantastic but has no acting ability or interesting traits as a character and she knows it. Her and Shia have no romantic chemistry either. So what has Bay done well at? John Malkovich turns in a great cameo as Sam's boss (his comedy sequences are actually funny). Shia is solid in his lead acting and Hugo Weaving was great at voicing Megatron, but the best was the voice-over acting of bot Sentinel Prime (Leonard Nimoy) who was really convincing as a villain and cleverly inserted the phrase from Spock in Star Trek, which you will know when you hear it. The CGI of all the robots was stunning, in fact the best CGI since Avatar with the 3D being impressive though mainly during the action sequences. It was terrifically photographed with some stunning scenery. The soundtrack music was quite good too. However where Bay has come the furthest is he ticked at least one of my three things I wanted change was the camera-work/editing during the action, it was much better! The camera flowed much better and was edited much less frenetically. It was superbly done and looked very professional. In fact there were scenes where there was slow-motion of the action, so I could see the action even more, actually happening and it was much more enjoyable as a result. Bay has wisely restrained himself in that respect and deserves credit.It's true Dark of the Moon does have it's flaws and Bay hasn't redeemed himself from all his mistakes in number two, but he has tried and the camera-work out of my three was my biggest gripe, which he changed. Also even after the 45 mins of bad jokes,the next 30 was good with one great action sequence on the motorway and the last hour of non-stop action, which I highly enjoyed and was the best part of the film. This dosen't deserve all the low ratings of one and twos, which it undoubtedly will receive as it's better than the second. I did get bored some times but it was tolerable, even at 2hr 30mins. It is far from the worst film I have seen this year and a decent summer popcorn flick that mostly entertained me. Believe me it was a pleasant surprise and if you see this with a more open mind, you might enjoy it too, though that is not guaranteed. I though am glad I saw it.",6,3,9,29 June 2011
The Pursuit of Happyness," It had so much potential, but it bitterly disappoints. Boring, uninspiring and very annoying.
","The Pursuit of Happiness follows the story of Chris Gardner and his five year old son Christopher in the early eighties as they end up on the street after Chris's wife leaves them. Gardner struggles to pay bills, do his job well where has to sell a advanced x-ray machine to hospitals to earn money. He and his son end up sleeping on the streets, at a motel, a bathroom and a homeless shelter and his only hope is a stockbroker internship programme with twenty applicants and only one can be hired.This film in a way is similar to the phenomenal Seven Pounds with Gabrille Muccino of sadness etc. I was really looking forward to this film and thought it would be amazing if not very good. People have described this as inspiring, hopeful and emotional. I felt none of that. This was so bitterly disappointing for me. To me this movie is just plain crap. Will Smith gives a reasonable performance, but I expected much more. I know this is based on a true story and living on the streets is bleak and horrifying and the film depicts it realistically well, but it just gets crammed down your throat constantly as though you are too dumb as an audience to understand what is happening. Gardner runs after people who steal his x-ray machine, he gets some money to get by, he loses some,find a place to sleep with a bed then has to sleep on the street. It's like a repeating time loop and just becomes so repetitive that I just got bored and very annoyed. There are a few touching moments between Smith and his real life son Jaden who plays Christopher but it's few and far between and when it does come it's far too late. I just didn't care about them or there story.There is little or if no hope in this film at all even though he's pursuing happiness. So he gets the job at the end? It's more like the money that makes him happy.This films mocks you with the title as there is no happiness and though the ending is meant to depict that. I felt nothing and I was uninspired. Not to mention in moments when the film is sad there is happy music. What's that about? There's little bonding between father and son and even the son was getting on my nerves. One of the most disappointing and overpraised movies I have seen. I just feel depressed, very annoyed and absolutely conned. Seven Pounds is fantastic see that instead. Not this deceitful boring garbage.",1,11,21,4 May 2010
The Bourne Supremacy," A far superior sequel that hugely surpasses it's predecessor
","Naturally when the sequel to the disappointing Bourne Identity The Bourne Supremacy came out. I wasn't interested in seeing it at the cinema but five years later my dad who is a big fan of the films persuaded me to sit down with him one afternoon to watch the sequel. I was bored at the time and didn't have anything else to do so I thought how bad could it be.Well guess what it wasn't and I wasted five years of when I could have watched it. This was a terrific sequel and picks up where the first one left off with Bourne wanting to discover more about his past and about Treadstone, cue comes the CIA coming after him. All the old characters return mostly like Brian Cox and Joan Allen who are excellent in there roles.Karl Urban with a surprisingly good Russian accent is the assassin in this one and makes a fearsome adversary. Franke Potente as Bourne's girlfriend returns briefly but unfortunately gets terminated at the beginning of the film so there's no more sequels for her.Two factors that make the sequel much better than it's predecessor is Matt Damon. His acting is much better in this and disarms the bad guys smoothly and though he may not have the aura of a menacing assassin, he is cool,efficient and professional.Another factor is the action there is much more in this one and is edited frenetically hand-held by director Paul Greengrass, but the camera is never so swinging that you can't see what's happening and as a result the action sequences create more excitement and give them authenticity with some amazing stunts attached.With more action the focus of the story is apparent but has been toned down and more simplified, which makes it more easy to follow and interesting. This movie has been made with a visual flair, almost like art with excellent acting and action which is expertly made.I'm glad I gave this second one a chance and that it is much improved on the first. I can't wait now to the third one.",8,1,2,27 December 2009
The Fighter," The Fighter is a good boxing drama, but it fails to deliver a hefty punch. Overrated and over-hyped. A giant disappointment.
","I was really looking forward to The Fighter after the hype shown on here with most of the ratings being eight, nine and ten and 8.2 overall, plus also the critics praising it comparing to be like Rocky etc and that Christian Bale deserves an Oscar for best actor or whatever and thought it would ring true sadly it did not.I knew the story was formulaic and cliché with the exact same structure as Rocky making it predictable, that wasn't the problem. My problem the film fails to be inspirational or have much heart and emotion like Rocky. Many of the characters are remotely unlikeable like Alice Ward, the mother (Mellisa Leo), but the biggest problem of this movie was Micky's (Mark Wahlberg) brother 'Dickie' (Christian Bale) who is a selfish crack-head and dosen't really redeem himself much, only a little in the last half hour. You don't really come to care about him as result as he treats his brother like crap (just like his mum) and dosen't care about his little son. Also there is little depth or characterisation to the characters like we never find out what motivated Dickie to become involved in violence and drugs so they just seem one-dimensional including Walhberg's character Micky. Part of me not liking this film as much as others like Rocky is Dickie being unlikeable but this is based on a true story, so the character is accurately portrayed and director David Russel dosen't pretend otherwise. My problem is that Bale is completely the wrong actor for this role, which makes his performance I'm afraid terrible and one of his worst and nowhere near worthy of an Oscar. He isn't a bad actor as I liked him in Equilibrium, Batman Begins, The Machinist and Terminator Salvation (though not The Dark Knight). But he just didn't fit into the role for me and looked like a young boy who wears his father's clothes and it's too big for him. As a result his character comes across as childish in that result and instead of goofy charming is goofy idiot and annoying. Another problem is the script which is bad (just like in Rocky), but the actors used it and managed to make it seem meaningful, like Stallone with his gruff charm and facial expressions. Bale pretty much keeps the same throughout and even Walhberg wasn't good at first and sounded dull at certain points.Furthermore though the boxing fights are competently shot and choreographed, it's quite mediocre really with little excitement,spirit or inspiration unlike in Rocky or Raging Bull where you really cheer for the main character and want him to win. The Fighter has the opposite effect. However Melissa Leo gives a good performance as Micky's mum, Walhberg improves as the film goes and adapts himself to the script and puts more effort into how he projects his dialogue, which makes his acting worthy by the end. But the best performance is Micky's girlfriend Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams) who is terrific and gives a honest and believable performance lending her character substance and depth which the others sadly lack. Also I like that she stuck by Micky throughout unlike his so called family and actually punches one of Angie's dim-witted sisters (that was a classic moment). I also enjoyed the music and it was well shot and edited.It did start out terrible but it got better and it entertained me enough, but it's been well over-hyped with a lot of people duped into believing it is as great as Rocky. I'm afraid it reaches nowhere near and if Bale does get the Oscar, it would be criminal as it deserves to go to other actors I've seen who have been far more exceptional than him. 2011 has been a amazing year of films for me up till now and The Fighter is the worst I've seen so far (of the previous seven I've seen), but it won't remain the worst. It's just it's the first film this year I've been disappointed by. It's worth seeing and it entertains with a couple of great performances but it's easily forgettable and not worth seeing at the pictures, only renting on DVD. A great disappointment as it had the potential to be so much more.",6,2,7,9 February 2011
