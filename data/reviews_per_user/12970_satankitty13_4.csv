The Incredible Hulk," It's almost like God compared to the 2003 film...
","First off, Edward Norton is a much better Bruce Banner, and actor than Eric Bana. He gives one of the best performances for a comic book film easily. Their are other great actors in this film such as Liv Tyler, William Hurt, Tim Roth, and more. But what makes this movie is obviously the action. It's not even action, it's hyper action. It's like Live Free or Die Hard action. The battles are so intense in this film especially the final fight between the Hulk and Abomination. Now for the story, it is quite entertaining and the dialog works really well. The film is well executed and shows Hulk can do so much more than the atrocity from Ang Lee. Now the flaws in this film are minor, such as how sometimes the CGI Hulk looks incredible but half of the time he looks so unrealistic. Also, there are some parts where the story drags a bit such as the beginning of the film. But besides those small complaints, this is a great summer flick that will be enjoyed by most people but mainly enjoyed by the people who are really into the action genre.I give The Incredible Hulk: 4/5 or 8/10",8,2,5,6 July 2008
Cloverfield," A Great, New Monster Film...
","I have to thank J.J. Abrams for coming up with an original monster movie because there hasn't been one for a long time. It's nice to see a brand new monster especially from America because this is technically our very first monster.Now for the movie, the plot is actually quite entertaining and besides the first boring 20 minutes that show the characters, it is actually a solid, intense film with many dramatic and thrilling scenes. In my opinion, I enjoyed the camera option because for me it felt like I was actually in the film. (Besides getting over the fact that there could never be something like this happen.) But sometimes the camera would shake way too much and it would become nauseating at points to watch which detracts from the experience. Thankfully, it doesn't happen often but for those who are motion-sickness, this is not the film for you. The actors, even though they are not entirely famous, they actually do a pretty good job at portraying their character and they exceed my expectations for them because I thought they wouldn't that good of a job. The only real complaint I had with this film is the ending. The ending is disappointing because it finishes with something totally unrelated to the story, unless you notice something small during the shot. Most likely though, you're not going to spot it because I know I didn't when I saw this for my first time. Somebody told me about it and then I realized what is was. Overall, Cloverfield is an intense film with great dialog, great characters, but an unsatisfying end to the tale. I recommend you to see it if you haven't already.I give Cloverfield: 4/5 or 8/10",8,0,2,6 July 2008
Iron Man," Greatest Comic Book Movie...Period.
","Iron Man is just genius and not only does it live up to the hype, it obliterates with great acting, great dialog, clever humor, and awesome action sequences throughout. What made this movie is simple...Robert Downey Jr. He literally became Iron Man and his stunning performance blew me away. There is really nothing to say bad about this film except one thing, and it's minor. I believe there should have been more action sequences, not a whole bunch, just a little more and I would have given this movie a perfect 10. Overall, Iron Man is the best superhero movie to date, great actors, excellent visuals, and best of all, the amazing script to this film. I haven't seen such an outstanding script in years. This movie practically delivered on all accounts.I give Iron Man a very solid: 4.5/5 or 9/10",9,9,16,8 July 2008
The Godfather," Arguably, the greatest film of all time.
","The Godfather in one word...Perfect. This film has some of the best scenes I've seen all my life. The script is superb and the director is one of the best in the business. The actors were great and all played a vital role in this masterpiece. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino have possibly given their best performances in this film than any other they have starred in. Some people might not like this film because it's too long but I think that's sad. People like them should absolutely give this film a chance and if they still don't like it then there is something completely wrong with their taste in movies. Overall, The Godfather is an outstanding achievement of Hollywood cinema and it delivers on ALL accounts. There is nothing bad I have to say about this film. It is literally perfect.I give The Godfather a perfect: 5/5 or 10/10",10,7,12,8 July 2008
