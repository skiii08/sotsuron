Deepwater Horizon," Worth a Watch
","This is a movie about the 2010 BP oil disaster on the Deepwater Horizon platform and mainly concentrates on the events leading up to the explosion and the explosion itself.If I am being honest, it was a bit slow for the first half of the film but when the action sequences kick in, it was quite impressive with good use of CGI effects and rattles along at a good pace.My friends in the industry say its not accurate, however, for the lay person its OK - the acting is OK, the script is OK the effects are good. What is disappointing is that very little attention was paid to the consequences of the explosion like the environmental impact and subsequent court case etc etcOverall though, not a bad movie and an enjoyable watch - probably a 7.5 rather than a straight 7/10.",7,0,0,24 August 2017
Wind River," Fantastic Movie
","This is almost a ten, the only reason its a 9 is because IMDb don't allow half marks. I don't want to say too much about this movie other than its absolutely fantastic and easily worthy you time - what a refreshing surprise after being so disappointed with the drivel I have watched churned out of the Hollywood machine for most of the year.Taylor Sheridan has now written Sicario, Hell or High Water and now this movie, putting him among the best writers in Hollywood and as great films go 3 for 3. Wind River is beautifully shot, great writing and the two leads played by Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olson are really top notch.When March 2018 comes around and its 'Oscar time', don't be surprised at all to see this movie nominated in at least one category. Fantastic.",9,2,5,11 October 2017
Ready Player One," Its OK(ish)
","It hardly rises to the level of modern classic like some people reviewing seem to think it is and its all a bit 'meh' really but in overall it just about rises to the levels of OK. I've given in 6 but its a 6.5 really in my book, its not terrible and it rolls along at a frantic pace with many, many references to my youth which brought back lots of memories. The acting is pretty mediocre, although I wasn't over keen on the lead character - the script is OK and the CGI is OK as well - worth a watch if you are looking to kill a few hours and enjoy a bit of nostaligia now and again.",6,1,2,20 June 2018
A Quiet Place," More of a 7.5/10
","Its a monster movie, its a horror movie two major points that mean don't take it too seriously so as long as you leave your brain at the cinema door and are able to ignore some of the more obvious shortcomings what you are left with is quite a good film.
The acting is pretty good especially the deaf girl and the monsters are pretty cool as well but the best bit of the film has to be the sound design, brilliantly done (if sometimes slightly over the top) that gives the watcher and edge of the seat, suspenseful movie. More of a 7.5 than an 8/10 but I will be generous.",8,1,2,28 June 2018
Hidden Figures," You Would Be a Fool Not To Watch!
","For some reason I just didn't fancy watching this at all, I had a feeling it would be boring, not my normal thing and I would probably end up switching it off half way through. How wrong I was! Hidden Figures is an uplifting, inspiring movie with the struggle of being a black female working in a male dominated industry in the early 60's - drawing parallels with NASA's own struggle of trying to put a man into orbit.Everything about this film is first rate, the acting is outstanding (particularly Kevin Costner & Taraji P. Henson), the direction which really made you care for these ladies without manipulating you emotionally, it was engaging and funny and kept you interested from the very start to the closing credits.Pack away your own prejudices about this movie like me and get it watched, its great.",9,1,8,2 March 2017
Joker," A Solid 8/10
","I think a lot of the reviews on here are a bit over the top, its a very good movie but in no way the masterpiece that they would have you believe. Its a very intense movie and perfectly set in a Gotham which is portrayed as a sort of grim, bleak, grimy New York but at times you feel yourself wondering how long of the movie is left given the film's slow pace. Everything about the movie is pretty good though with one exception, Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead and will no doubt get best actor at the Oscars. This ain't no Marvel movie which, for me at least, can only be a good thing.",8,1,4,7 January 2020
The Big Short," Brilliant
","I ummed and ahhed about The Big Short - did I fancy watching this film or not? would it be boring? would it be too complicated? could I be bothered with a film about finance. I ended up watching it and I am so pleased I did, what a fabulous movie - it was totally engrossing, exciting, easy to follow and the acting from all the main characters was superb, it even has the most unlikeliest people like Margot Robbie, Anthony Bourdain and Selena Gomez at hand to explain directly to the viewer in layman's terms some of the more complex points about finance. I would be truly surprised if the Big Short doesn't at least get something at the Oscars, I was truly blown away by this movie - do yourself a massive favour and watch it at the earliest opportunity you have!",9,1,2,17 February 2016
Black Panther," Wow
","Wow, what am I missing - who rates this movie so high? its boring, the acting and dialogue are pathetic and the CGI at times is dodgy to say the least. Another piece of crap off the never ending conveyer belt of superhero movies that yet again has been rushed out to cash in on the popularity of this type of rubbish.",2,2,6,26 June 2018
Deadpool," OKish
","I am very surprised to see this movie with such a high rating, I was looking forward to watching it especially since nearly everybody had given it rave reviews. Having watched it, I must say I am bitterly disappointed - if ever a movie suffered because it was over-hyped, this is it. I'm not saying its a terrible movie, badly acted or even badly conceived action sequences - its all just OK. I didn't find it particularly funny, his inane quips even started getting on my nerves by the end of the movie. Its worth watching if you are a fan of comic book heroes, you may even enjoy it - I just found it all a bit samey, if this movie was a colour it would be beige, its OK but don't believe the hype like I did and expect it to be great!",7,2,9,4 April 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," Very Enjoyable War Movie
","Hacksaw Ridge is an unflinching, violent assault on your senses with action sequences and people being blown apart, shot in the head, losing limbs etc etc etc which reminded me of the brutal opening scenes in Saving Private Ryan.The film follows Desmond Doss, who enlisted in the US Army despite his refusal to take up arms due to religious beliefs but was determined to save lives as a medic.During the fighting, on top of a 400-foot cliff which gives the film its title, Doss drags 75 of his comrades to safety and ultimately receives the medal of honour.Great acting, however, its a bit slow to get going and it can be a bit predictable with several of the usual clich√©s thrown in.All in all its a pretty good movie all the same - I rate it higher than an eight but not quite a nine but I've rounded it up anyway. Highly enjoyable.",9,1,6,8 February 2017
Alien: Covenant," Could Have Been Better
","I was so looking forward to this movie and while not being an absolutely unmitigated disaster, its not really very good at all - the visuals are quite good, the aliens are quite good but the script writing is dreadful.How can so many stupid people be on the same spaceship and make stupid decision after stupid decision throughout the whole movie. Then there's the surprise twist ending, dah dah! - saw that one coming from a mile off I'm afraid.I'm giving it a 5 because I'm feeling generous having just sat through 90 minutes of Nicolas Cage's - Dog Eat Dog, believe me Alien: Covenant is a masterpiece compared to that crap.",5,0,3,4 July 2017
