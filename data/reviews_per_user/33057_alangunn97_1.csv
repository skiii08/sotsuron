Raiders of the Lost Ark," The Definitive Blockbuster
","Ever since I was a kid, I had loved movies. And one of the most influential movies for me were the Indiana Jones movies, my favorite being Raiders of the Lost Ark, which I consider my favorite movie of all time. This is how you do a blockbuster: action packed, fast paced, tougue in cheek, romantic, and heaps of fun. Harrison Ford is the perfect action hero. He's tough, vulnerable, funny, bad-ass, and extremely likable. The moment he comes on screen, you fall in love with that character. Spielberg directs the movie perfectly, it feels exactly like an old school adventure serial, and has the same energy and pure spirit. The action scenes are phenomenal, some of the best ever filmed. Not only are they intense, but there's little to no CG. Lastly, I'll mention the iconic score by John Williams, my favorite movie score of all time. It's my favorite movie of all time, what else do I need to say? 10/10.",10,0,1,2 August 2012
