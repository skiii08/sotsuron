The Blair Witch Project," Interesting, not that scary and nauseating.
","I saw Blair Witch in the theaters because my friend suggested we should see it. I went into The Blair Witch Project not knowing what the heck it was about. I never even knew it was a horror movie. I'm not big on horror movies but as I was watching the movie, I thought the style of camera work that BWP was in was a great idea. However, with the sudden shake of the camera, it got nauseating. Overall, it's not a bad movie, but it's not that good either. The only scary thing about The Blair Witch Project, is when the movie ends (or the last two seconds of movie) because you as the audience knows what's going to happen.",Null,0,1,14 July 2001
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Horrible movie
","I rented this movie because I needed something to watch with my friends. I had only seen a few South Park episodes, and they weren't that bad. I expected the South Park movie to be witty, just like the show, but I was wrong. I did not like this movie at all (and it's not because I'm from Canada). The story is actually good (but it kind of drags on), but the main reason I don't like this movie is the vulgarity in the script. I really don't like listening to a record number of swear words in an animated movie such as this. It's just not my kind of movie, and if you don't like vulgarity, DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE.",1,4,29,18 July 2001
Finding Nemo," One of the best movies of all-time
","Pixar has done it again, it seems that whenever Pixar and Disney come out with a movie it is always a tremendous success, and Finding Nemo is no exception. This is the best Pixar film yet and it will be tough to beat. The visual effects are amazing; everything in this Pixar ocean looks so real, from the sand to the sunlight hitting the water. You almost feel like you're underwater and it's hard to imagine that this is animation is not real. The voice work just adds to the animation and makes the movie that much better. Hands down, Ellen DeGeneres is the best in this movie; her voice work as Dory is just hilarious. Every scene that Dory is in I couldn't help but laugh, and with help from the script, the film has some of the funniest scenes in a children's movie. This movie is perfect for kids as it will amuse and entertain them or whoever else may be watching with them. The animation literally comes alive, the humor is everywhere and this all makes Finding Nemo a movie that is extremely enjoyable to watch.",10,1,2,2 December 2003
Scary Movie 2," Not as funny as the first...
","The first Scary Movie was hilarious and I decided to wait and see the sequel on video because I heard it was bad. Good call. Although the first Scary Movie was disgusting and funny, Scary Movie 2 doesn't deliver as much big laughs as the first one. Another point, is that the sequel isn't as sick as the first and that's a nice quality. The spoof on old movies doesn't work all the time, but the Charlie's Angels, Titanic and Mission: Impossible II do. The returning cast is good (especially Cindy and Brenda), but not Ray (who's sexual identity is still questioned), and I wish a few other people would have returned. Some of the new cast isn't great, all the main adults aren't well done, but the new teens Theo, Alex and Buddy are great. Overall, there are A FEW funny moments and chuckles in this movie, but the original is better.",5,1,2,24 December 2001
American Pie," No words can describe or explain....
","I can't explain why this movie is so amazing. I just love it, it's one of my all-time favorite movies. American Pie is groundbreaking in movie history as it explores issues no other film has touched. It's a movie for teens and it is incredibly and amazingly enjoyable. I loved every single second of this movie, the script and directing is well done and all of the main and minor actors play their role well including Shannon Elizabeth, Seann William Scott, and of course Jason Biggs. But the one thing that makes the movie completely enjoyable is the gross out humor and sexual exploitations, all of which are done very well (which is rare). American Pie is a movie to go down in history as one of the best teen movies of all-time, and although it's not a movie for everyone, it's definitely one to watch with friends.",9,0,0,4 July 2002
Spider-Man," Amazing and Incredible!!
","Spider-Man is an amazing movie, it is so enjoyable to watch. Anyone who likes good movies or who is a fan of the comic should watch it. Everything about the movie is amazing and there is so much room for a sequel! All the actors are well casted and they do a great job portraying their character. It's visually stunning, the graphics are well done too and the camera angles are incredible, although a lot of the movie is computer graphics it's all realistic. The story itself is very good, nothing gets confusing and everything plays out well in it's place. The only negative thing I could say about it, is that it may be a little violent for younger kids, but no one should miss this if you want to see a good movie!",10,0,0,4 May 2002
The Butterfly Effect," In my opinion, a must-see!
","Last night I saw 'The Butterfly Effect' and I have to say I really, really liked. Just the entire concept of going back and changing one thing from your past and as a result completely changing your present. It made me a stronger believer in 'everything happens for a reason'. Sometimes we all say we wanna go back and change an event that happened, thinking our present or future will be better, and it just isn't the case sometimes. It's in the past for a reason! What's done is done! I'd recommend it if you haven't already seen it, it's got an appeal everyone can relate to, in the end we learn that changing one thing in your life, changes everything. A very enjoyable movie to watch unravel!",9,0,2,28 April 2005
Moulin Rouge!," Crazy and Colorful!
","This movie is great to watch! The sets are amazing and very well done, the costumes are fantastic and the acting is first rate! Moulin Rouge is crazy, but in a very fun way. There is so much going on, all the actors are outgoing and the dancing and singing is so lively and the acting is so natural. The entire movie is fun and it's a splash of color, it is everywhere you look. Nicole Kidman does such a great job portraying all the emotions her character has and she sings so well. The fact that it's a musical didn't bother me, the movie isn't swamped with songs, but they are put in select scenes that work very, very well. Moulin Rouge is a fun movie to watch, the type you can enjoy every time you watch it.",9,0,1,29 December 2001
Toy Story 2," Amazing!
","Toy Story 2 is better than Toy Story. The animation so realistic, it's amazing! The story of Woody finding his pals is great and Buzz's adventure with the toys is very well planned out! The best part of the movie is when the toys are in Al's Toy Barn. The imagination of this movie is so great for a kids movie. This movie will be loved forever, one of the best sequels in history!",10,0,1,13 September 2000
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A fantastic book to movie transfer!
","I was so excited to hear about the Harry Potter movie and I couldn't wait to see it. When I did, I was very, very satisfied with the results. The movie sticks to the book so well (without minor scenes), and every image is so satisfying and enjoyable to watch. The characters practically jump out of the book and the roles of Harry, Ron and Hermione are very well acted (not to mention Snape, Dumbledore, McGonagall and the Dursleys). All of the imagery is so believable, it looks like they didn't use computer graphics at all! These scenes include the Quidditch game and the large chess match, and those are only two of the unbelievable scenes. The entire two hours and 30 minutes is so tremendously worth it for all fans of the Harry Potter books, however the movie is not an excuse for not reading the book. The movie is amazing and realistic, but it lacks the sense of reading the book.",9,0,0,22 November 2001
Bring It On," Smart, Sassy and Funny
","If you want to bring on a good and funny movie, Bring It On is the one! This movie is good to enjoy over and over again because it's funny and sassy. The writing in Bring It On is genius, it's hilarious, it's smart and it fits the movie and characters so well. Everything about the movie is great, the music is catchy and up-beat and the actors do a great job! The entire Toros cheerleading squad is funny and well acted (especially Kirsten Dunst), and the audience goes through their trials and tribulation like you were there. There are A LOT of very funny moments in Bring It On that will make you laugh every time you watch them. The one tiny flaw in the movie are those 3 girls from Blaque, they don't work well with Gabrielle Union (who is great on her own). Either way, this movie will leave a smile on your face in the end.",8,0,0,29 December 2001
Shrek," One word: Hype
","I really don't understand the big deal of Shrek. It's supposed to be this amazing movie because it has done so well and everything about it is great. I saw it on video and enjoyed it, but it really, really doesn't live up to the hype. Visually it's stunning, but that is the only thing that is stunning about Shrek. The message is so overdone and the ending is very predictable. Not to mention that the movie has no plot, and there's nothing to look forward to towards the end. Not to mention the 'choice' words in the movie not intended for children. Good for kids to watch a few times, but not one to enjoy over and over again.",7,0,0,11 November 2001
The Silence of the Lambs," Classic horror movie
","I saw Hannibal (the sequel) before seeing The Silence of the Lambs and I was very interested in watching the original. Whenever this movie is mentioned among people, they ALWAYS say it's incredibly scary. No one can sleep after watching it, and that's why I was so intrigued to watch it. I was a bit nervous while watching Silence because everyone made such a big deal about how scary it was. While watching it, I realized Silence is an incredibly action filled movie. It is done so well, the acting is perfect and the way everything turns out is amazing. I have to say that I didn't find it very scary ONLY because I had seen Hannibal before Silence. However, the ending is very, very intense, and I can see why people say it's scary. Also, just the fact what Hannibal Lector and Buffalo Bill do is scary enough. It's scary and not a movie to be seen alone on a rainy Friday night, it is a movie to see though because it is very well done.",10,1,1,21 August 2001
X2: X-Men United," An Amazing Movie
","What an amazing movie that is a perfect adaptation to the X-Men comics and cartoon. First I have to say that if you see this movie before the first one, you'll be confused and won't really understand why things happen the way they do. X2 isn't really a movie on its own, you need to have seen the first one. But everything about this movie, is so much bigger and better than the first, all of which equals to an enjoyable movie to watch many times. One of the best things about it, is that Rogue and Iceman have a much, much stronger role. As well as Pyro, making things interesting for an X3 (not to mention the hint of Phoenix in Jean). The characters are all amazing to watch on screen, all the main mutants are great on screen as they work together, and the effect of their powers make it better. Even the filming locations (Canada) look amazing on screen. The one negative comment I have, is that a few of the stunts and effects seemed a little un-realistic such as the X-Wing, but it's a small price to pay for such a good movie. Definitely a movie to watch if you're a fan and even if you're not, you'll still like it.",10,1,2,7 May 2003
