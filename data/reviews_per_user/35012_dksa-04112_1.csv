Hereditary," A horrible waste of time
","The Amazon Prime short description underplayed the level of stupidity and lack of redeeming qualities of this film. About halfway through, we suspected it would be a waste of time, but thought we should give it a chance to come around. NO SUCH LUCK. It just gets grosser and ultimately fails to provide any satisfaction - unless you like loud meaningless background music (typical of stupid horror movies) or gross bloody violence.
Do yourself a favor and avoid this mess.",1,2,5,9 January 2019
