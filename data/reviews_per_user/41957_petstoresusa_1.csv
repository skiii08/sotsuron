The Incredible Hulk," An OK attempt by the guy that made Transporter 2
","The Incredible Hulk is a story I'm sure most are familiar with. It's a Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde tale of a man (Bruce Banner) who struggles with his transformations in to the Hulk. However, the Hulk is a bit unique because even though he is a crazed behemoth, he still has a moral compass when enraged as the Hulk.I don't like providing spoilers so I'll be short with this review. The acting is decent and the special effects are great. The story is a bit of a drag and doesn't focus on Banner's struggle enough.It's an entertaining watch but you probably won't be craving for multiple viewings. It's a good flick to waste a couple hours on but nothing special here.",5,0,2,4 February 2009
