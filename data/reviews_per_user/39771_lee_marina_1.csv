Walk the Line," that made a sweeping impression
","I'm not fond of biographical films, but that one attracted my attention. before watching this film i've checked some biographical facts about Johnny Cash. it's great that they made a movie which is true to life. 
the movie is made really good. the actors played their roles so great, the film was watched in one breath. 
Johnny Cash and the staff did a great job meking this film. 
i have only good impression about J.R. he was talented and good person. and i appreciate that he thanks to his friends and June could get through all the trouble and back to life again.",8,0,0,4 March 2018
