Ghost," Ghost...........Classic!
","After so many years, every time when I see this movie again, it always makes my eyes water! This is basically a simple story. However, the script writer by Bruce Joel Rubin and the director by Jerry Zucker are intelligent. They made the simple story a touching, interesting one. I think most people cried at the end of the movie. This reminded me another commercial successful movie 'Titanic' in the year 1997. The music (composed by Maurice Jarre) was so moving. Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore played well, not to mention Whoopi Goldberg. Her performance was amazing!(she also had excellent acting in Spielberg's early masterpiece 'The Color Purple') The visual effects by ILM was extraordinary in that time. By and large, this touching movie is not only a huge commercial success, but also a classic!",Null,50,58,22 March 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Narnia - magic comes true!
","I just went back from the movie. It was so crowded...just like Star Wars EP3. The lion, the witch, and the wardrobe novels were my favorite when I was in elementary school. I remembered after reading all the series of novels, I wondered why there was no one making movies (not mini TV program) for Narnia. Until now, thanks for ILM and WETA's cooperation. At last, the magic comes true! The director Andrew Adamson and all other creative crews visualize the story in novels. Basically, I think the adaption of this movie from the novel is excellent. Such as the white witch, she is just like what was in my mind while I was reading the novel. I think most readers will not be disappointed. I find it is a Disney movie and it is for kids; thus there is no blood and much violence in this movie. (Unlike the lord of the ring trilogy, it is basically for adults and it is quite violent and bloody, but Istill love it, and it is very realistic) I think I can say it is 'the lord of the ring - kid edition'. The movie score composed by Harry Gregson-Williams is great and touching. Special effects and Visual effects are extraordinary. They are quite realistic. Most of the sequences are just like what they were in my mind while I was a child. After seeing it, I was moved. Finally, this classical stories are on the wild screen just like the lord of the ring, Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, and so on. I heard most other people saying that they love this movie when leaving the theater. I do really look forward to the next Narnia movies! Go see it! No matter you have read the novels or not.",Null,1,2,10 December 2005
The Hills Have Eyes," Good Job! Alexandre Aja! A very disturbing Good horror movie!
","After seeing this movie for the first time in the theater, the only thing came to my mine was : WOW! What a horror movie should be! Indeed, this movie is outstanding of its genre. The atmosphere set in this film was brilliant. Fast pace, and bloody which is necessary for this kind of film. Everything is perfect including the scoring. The whole movie is quite disturbing - which is the major reason I would give all my credits to it. Very disturbing. The best scene, personal opinion, is the trailer scene when the burning on the body tied on the tree and the rape is happening in the trailer. Very disturbing and scary as well. I would say the trailer scene can be one of my ten favorite 'scary' or 'disturbing' scenes. Very brilliant. Good job director Alexandre Aja!",Null,1,1,31 January 2007
Independence Day," I D 4 = great Star Wars movie in modern world
","Though some many harsh critics and bad attitude toward this movie, I know that. The story is cheesy, the plot is stupid, and no depth in the whole movie...alright, that can be true. However, undoubtedly, this is still a very good summer popcorn movie and indeed it hit the box office with no surprise. The Visual effects and Special effects during 96~97 were still stunning. Basically, it is quite similar to the classic Star Wars trilogy...aircraft chasing and mother ship attacked. In my personally opinion, the story itself is still interesting. The script writers actually did a good job. They created not single-dimension crisis at the same time, and when people resolved one crisis and then another one just appeared. It made the story intensive and easily grabs audiences' tension. Besides, the reason why there were still so much people feel like it was so realistic during watching in the theater was because the whole story was set in modern world. The Big Apple (where I live) and other important capitals around the world. People are familiar with these places so that people may feel very realistic at that time. Besides, I do love the first person shot and the score. The first person POV shots are really good in the battle scenes. The director Roland Emmerich is really doing a good job - to provide a good and exciting entertained movie during the summer. The score composed by David Arnold is excellent. After seeing this movie in the theater, I just ran to CD store to buy its soundtrack. The music in this movie is definitely can be placed among John Williams' classics. There is no need to take such a exciting sci-fi movie too serious.My rating 10 out of 10.",Null,2,4,2 February 2007
A Beautiful Mind," A Beautiful Mind, A Beautiful movie, A beautiful story, and Beautiful Performance
","A beautiful mind this movie becomes one of my favorite movies in my life after seeing' this movie in the theater in 2001. AS many many people said, this movie is beautiful, touching, and surprising - including its plot which audiences would never guess at the first part of this movie - and Russell Crowe who is excellent in acting. Tom Hanks is one of my loving actors, and now Russell Crowe will be added to my list. His appearance, his movement, his dialog, his walking, and his personality changes during different period in the movie. I find it is really a pity that he did not win the academy awards because of his bad news - he punched someone outside the hotel or something like that. AS for Ed Harris, Jennifer Connelly, and Paul Bettany, they all deserved the best supporting actor/actress. All the characters are very realistic. As for the director Ron Howard, he is good in adapting the story from the original novel to the screen. He deeply describes the main character - John Nash's characters, his emotions, and the relationship with his wife. The surprising in the middle of the story is quite impressive - if the audience haven't read the novel. I do love the touching ending. It made most of the people in the theater cry. At any rate, the production of this movie is brilliant, and it deserves THE BEST MOVIE for academy awards in 2002. If you haven't seen this movie, go see it. The best movie from 2001 to 2002. my rating 10/10",Null,0,1,11 October 2005
Jaws," Steven Spielberg started his legend here !
","I saw this incredible movie at the age of 6. I remembered after seeing this film, I was always wondering if the great shark came to bite me while I was taking the shower. Indeed, this unique movie in 1975 scared all the people away from the beach and screamed in the theater. This movie has good photography, complete story, amazing special effects (at that time), and good directing. Though this movie was a disaster for Spielberg during filming, the box office still reached unbelievable point in film history. Obvious, this movie makes Steven Spielberg this name well known all over the world. the movie is intensive, frightening, and well entertaining. Spielberg is good in creating nervous shot (like shark's point of view for approaching the victim) and excellent atmosphere. In addition, the greatest music composer John Williams used simple three to four phonograms to grab the audience's attention. At any rate, this highly entertaining movie affects film making of this genre for the later thirty years. If you like exciting, and would like to 'study' movies' implication' I strongly recommend to see this film.",Null,3,7,22 September 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," THE BEST MOVIE IN HISTORY ! If you like to see movies, go see this first !
","With so many awards and commends, I think I don't have to say more. In IMDb, it always the top1 or 2 in the list. This movie always is the top 1 in many people. This touching movie is always mentioned on BBS board again and again. Without fancy special effects and visual effects, without good-looking super stars, without amazing filming tricks, this movie (the story) is extraordinary. It is touching, and gives all people hope. It gives me dreams. Especially at the end of this beautiful film, when friendship comes, when dreams come true, and when the light of human's soul is lightened up. This film gives people hope. I think everyone seeing this movie has been moved. The two main actors Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman have excellent acting, and the director Frank Darabont -- he is truly amazing. It is always hard to adapt one short story into a film. However, the director've done such an amazing thing. The film is so attractive and the script is perfect. I like the way he uses narration to tell a story. One thing I felt disappointed is for Academy Award in 1995. I think it is really the most difficult year for all the members to select for the best picture and the best director. I love Forrest Gump and Shawshank Redemption. Both of them are excellent. If they are in different year, Shawshank Redemption undoubtedly deserves 'the best picture' and 'the best director'. I wanna give this film eleven out of ten (I do love this movie!) This film with no doubt that it is the top3 important movie in film history! If you like movies, and you have no chance to see it, go see it!One of the most important films in history.",Null,0,1,31 October 2005
The Sixth Sense," The Sixth Sense - I see dead people......I also see high Box Office!
","I remember in 1999 after the movie was ended, all the audiences were all stunned and remained sitting on their seats... This excellent masterpiece is directed and written by the genius Indian director M. Night Shyamalan. He brings the traditional Indian concepts of human's life and death to the Western country via his movie. Then it becomes a fresh idea for the Westerners. The story is quite scary on the first part of the film. However, it also contains emotion between parent and child. It is really touching. When the BIG surprising ending comes in, all the questions in this movie have been solved, and the whole story becomes very touching (Dr. Malcolm Crowe to his wife) Overall, this story (screenplay) is such a clever one which I haven't seen for years. this movie is not only to scary people, it also makes people believe in their faith. In addition, the soundtrack composed by James Newton Howard is great. it can create the mysterious atmosphere and terror for the film. Even though Bruce Willis is not that good in acting in this movie, the way he acts is still far greater than he did before. Most people may notice the supporting role Haley Joel Osment. He seems to be a natural born actor. I love his performance in the sixth sense (including his later movie A.I.) I think one day he can get what he deserves for academy awards. By and large, a clever story + a good director + good acting = extremely great box office and good reputation = The Sixth Sense",Null,0,1,21 September 2005
Cinderella Man," Cinderella Man, gives people hope
","Apparently,after 'A beautiful mind', another extra ordinary movie is bade by Ron Howard - Cinderella Man. The same production group, the same director, the same leading actor, and the same producer. This great and moving movie basically tells the same boxing movie - just like other boxing movie - put a person into the difficulty and then he eventually gains back what he deserves. However, this touching movie is different, in addition to the realistic boxing sequence, the setting can bring audiences back to the 30's. Russell Crowe once again plays an excellent job in this movie. At first, I assumed that 'Cinderella Man' will be another 'A Beautiful Mind', however, I was wrong after seeing this movie. This time, the director Ron Howard tries to tell a touching story in a normal and slight way. He did not put too much things into this film, but this common story makes people feel more. Anyway, go see this movie - another beautiful movie.",Null,1,2,11 October 2005
The Island," The Island - actually, it is over my expectation!
","At first, I assumed The Island will be another Michael Bay-style popcorn movie. However, I was wrong after going out of the theater. Basically, the original story is amazing. It has typical sci-fi elements, and of course, action elements which are 'must-be' in Michael Bay's movies. I like the story even more than Arnold Schwarzenegger's The Sixth Day. I like the ending especially. It left more for the audiences to think what is actually happened if all the clones escape out. No doubt, this is still a Michael Bay's movie-car chasing and flying sequences which make all the audiences excited. His MTV-like editing and fast-cut style still exist in this movie. By and large, there are eye-candy CGI, exciting chasing sequences, and amazing story. Steve Jablonsky did a good job for composing music for this movie, and Ewan McGregor is excellent in acting. When Lincoln Six Echo and Tom Lincoln see each other, you can easily tell the two different persons. This is one of my favorite sci-fi & action movie in the summer time in 2005. It is much better than Michael's another crap 'Armageddon'.I do love the ending. This story is amazing!My rating: 9/10",Null,0,0,13 November 2005
