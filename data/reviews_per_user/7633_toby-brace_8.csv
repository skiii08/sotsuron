Requiem for a Dream," Brutal
",I feel like I just got hit in the face with a shovel. What a masterpiece. There is no escape from it. A simple tale of spiraling addiction told with absolute devastating honesty. A warning to all human beings. The music reverberates with that Lux Aeterna strings riff that eventually feels like a terrible line of poetry as the story spirals down into a very dark place indeed. Aronofsky is one of the must interesting directors in the world today. He obviously cares only about making pieces of art and this time he has made one so dark and powerful that it should come with a warning label. I was expecting something along the lines of Drugstore cowboy - but this is much much more powerful stuff and much darker. Just wow.,10,1,2,21 May 2012
Juno," Brilliant dialog painfully cute
","Ellen Page is the funniest and cutest heroine ever to find herself up the duff in a clever and brilliantly executed piece of faux-indie product design that leaves me chastened with respect for the artists that made it. It is endlessly entertaining, fresh and insightful, original and witty, and not one piece of exploitation in the whole flick. Maybe some people feel that a feel-good movie about an accidental pregnancy where the girl does not suffer agonizing mental pain, where there is no sad and cruel life lesson, but in fact a logical and satisfying solution which leaves everybody intact, is some kind of sell- out? I don't see it myself. I see only a dazzling display of warmth and creativity that leaves me with a big dumb grin on my face. Oh and the music is super too.",9,0,2,1 January 2013
Predator," perfect
","It is hard to see how this action sci fi treat could possibly be improved. 17 years after it's release, and it has not dated AT ALL. It still stands out as a masterpiece of the genre. Action sci fi today should beware of being compared to this gem. I think it is the best work Arnie has ever done. Yes of course it is a simple role. Not much nuance here. But given this range to play with, he is utterly convincing. Nobody could have replaced him. He was perfect for it. If you had to pit one human being against a deadly super advanced sadistic alien hunter, who better than Arnie as a ruthless world class mercenary? Also, This is a real film, not a cartoon, despite the subject matter. The scenes in the jungle are highly atmospheric, the dialogue perfectly executed, it's all just exactly as it should be. The music, the special effects, and the battle sequences are delightfully crunchy and satisfying. Just a happy coincidence that it all came together this way I reckon. Right people, right time. It would be ruined if they tried to do it today. Oh wait, they did, and they did.",10,0,1,26 August 2014
Beasts of No Nation," Rare event
","It's not often that a film induces a genuine change of heart in me, but this one did. I used to simply hate and despise the raggedy rebel armies of West Africa with their child soldiers, their cruel atrocities and apparent primitive mindless violence towards civilians in general. But this film showed me a side to them that I had never considered. I found myself feeling sorry for them, and the cynical way in which they were used. I realized that they must also have courage, and discipline, and belief in the cause. Like any fighters, they must advance into deadly danger. The lead actor is a child, yet more than holds his own with Idris Elba, a great actor by any measure. By the end I was shaken. I will not forget this film. And I will never think the same way again about the tragic and pointless wars of Africa.",10,52,58,18 December 2015
I Am Legend," Could have been so much better
","This is a sad example of how a great premise and some great production and some great acting can be badly let down by crappy Hollywood conventions that ruin the atmosphere and puncture the viewers suspension of disbelief. I am referring to the awful cheesy old routines that are used over and over again. Stuff that makes A VERY LOUD NOISE for no reason other than to make the viewer jump. Yes well this viewer has seen way to many of those for it to have any effect any more except to be very annoying. Then there is the fact that every 'monster' must make a roaring shrieking hissing sound like a lion crossed with a hissing serpent, even if they only have a human throat and voice box to do it with. Then the fact that every 'nail biter' is always exactly the same. 'JUST AT THE LAST MINUTE' is really a tiresome old chessnut by now. How about a little real world timing for a change? The cars that seem to be doing 300 mph and then turn on a dime, the helicopters that spin so violently they would just disintegrate in real life. The people hanging onto the skids of said helicopter! All of this just ruins any sense of realism which this movie could have exploited so much more. It is really creepy to see a deserted New York rendered so effectively. Will Smith does fine. It just is cursed with this cartoon flavor which totally ruined it for me.",5,2,3,1 January 2013
Kick-Ass," the hard stuff
","I just saw this for the first time. 3 years after release. I ignored it first time round. I thought it was just more violent crap. I actually insulted the creators on public forums. I thought they were douchebags. Wannabes. I was so wrong. In fact they are artists. Lovers of all that is fresh and in your face. They know those moments that we all love, when the movie lifts you up and reminds you that this is just a game and the only thing that matters is to play with style. This is the freshest, funniest, most entertaining thing I've seen in a long time. It made me laugh out loud and shout 'yeah' on several occasions. It kicked my ass. Good job guys.",10,1,1,30 November 2013
Limitless," Nice idea, crappy logic
","I loved the idea. I loved the cool and sexy visuals. I thought I was going to really enjoy it as it got started and we see the effects of this wonder drug. But then the wheels fell off. This guy has discovered that he can write bestseller books in a few days. He finds that he can double his money on the stock market in a matter of hours. So, what does he do? Well of course he gets into debt with the Russian mafia. What? Why the f would he do that? Ever hear of the chessboard and the grains of wheat trick? You put one the first square, then double that on the second , and again on the third. You can't get to the last square, because there isn't that much wheat in the world. Exponential growth soon leads to astronomical numbers. This guy just needs to keep doing what he is doing for a couple of weeks and he will be the richest man on Earth. In his meeting with the bigshot financier, his friend says that he has turned 12 thousand dollars into 1.2 million in ten days. OK Well if he does that for another 20 days he will have 83 trillion dollars. Why is he going cap in hand to some wall st. guy? Lastly - there is no doubt that super intelligence would have many advantages, but being a lethal street fighter would not be one of them. Fighting is about millisecond reflexes and trained reactions that have nothing to do with conscious thought. His wonder drug would not give him such abilities. So. Terrible failure of the writers to really explore an interesting idea. 5/10.",5,0,1,25 July 2012
13 Hours," Blew me away
","Holy crap. Michael Bay made a truly great movie. That alone ought to tell you something. There is no way you can deny the power of this film. Yes there were a little too many pyrotechnics for my liking, but hey, it's Michael Bay. The story is just so powerful. And raises so many emotions. Of course it is political dynamite. But it does not go there, explicitly. There is no overt statement of blame. But.... that makes it all the more powerful. Those in charge, who were certainly aware of what was happening, simply do not appear in the film. They just aren't there. As they just weren't there on that terrible night.Very clever. That's not an accident.The most poignant scene of the film for me, and the most damaging for you-know-who, is a simple still shot, of a squadron of F-16's sitting idle on the runway. Doing nothing.Message received.",9,3,9,26 May 2016
