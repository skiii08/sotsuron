Iron Man 3," Iron man 3 Review
","The movie begins with the second phase of marvel in theaters, post-avengers, tony stark is with small personal trauma, due to its presence in the wormhole during the invasion Chitauri in Manhattan's. the film has parallel stories occurring in a saga called Extremis, the film shows part of such technology, nothing so important, the threat of the film is given initially at MANDARIN, Suspected terrorist leader who is making attacks using military. as guinea pigs, then comes the real problem of the film presented the villain actually is not the mandarin but Aldrich Killian which according to the film became a bad guy after Tony years ago he promised that he would consult his project, after which the climax of the movie is already established, all who know the stories of Iron Man, will be very disappointed by the hoax of mandarin, passes as an actor, to conceal the true villain. knowing that I as a fan of comics say this fact is rather bad, but the film has several very good moments as the action scenes are excellent acting of the characters are great, the plot in a general context is balanced, the special effects are very well done, highlighting the fall scene of stark mansion, where have all the technical potential that instant, not to mention that the 3D becomes something more IMERSIVA, the soundtrack was different, changing tracks most troubled by something more balanced . , The bad points of the film is by the plot itself despite the plot being balanced, we have an excess of jokes during the movie and that the transition from a tense moment is suddenly changed to a moment fanciful graces the jokes would be something like a comic relief that is generally Iron Man 3 is a great movie, are small details that have been changed so that the film becomes more popular and something that everyone can identify even for fans that can be developed something bad, it makes the movie has its own brightness.",5,0,1,30 June 2013
Man of Steel," Man of steel , the real superman movie from 21 century
","The movie puts emphasis on the planet krypton 'Planet Origin of Superman' the origin of how it happened in the destruction of the planet is very well developed. In this film we have the Superman is the superhero who still tries to find his place in the world, ie is the beginning, the film is taken before the threat of General Zod and his soldiers after they banned krypton solids eventually escaping; due the oath to pursue the son of Jor- El, Zod then search during the last decades son of krypton. hitherto Superman is still discovering itself and here comes the threat on earth. what we can say is that the film will please any fan of Superman, the vision that the film shows krypton is a realistic and never seen as alien, the special effects of the film are the best in terms of destruction ever seen, when i watching while the film felt the power range Superman and Zod, the film is gorgeous along with an extremely strong storyline have a great emotional appeal and that helps build the atmosphere, the soundtrack is raised to the top with orchestrated songs that show a Alien climate and excellent sound effects. the story of the film is also strong see many seeds sown in the plot that can be used later on, the very action of henry cavill is convincing, Jor-El (Russell Crowe) has an important role in building character, and Zod is simply well giving the appearance of villain; unfortunately for hardcore fans will not have the phrase iconic villain, a strong point of the film is also as the film is told mixing memories of this character and also giving a more harmful to the events. a single point that I disliked was how Superman movie this is serious, this is the most worthless before the greatness of the film, the 3D film is weak does not have that sense of immersion that we have in other films, which is transmitted images are deeper and nothing more. In order Man of Steel is the film that any fan of Superman always expected, we clearly see the power of it in action, everything builds the film is strong thanks to the plot and story very well developed, is the chance to see an unprecedented krypton before and feel that this movie shows is that it is the most expensive film ever made, but the film is amazing and not only fans of the character will enjoy but everyone who sees this amazing movie!.",8,2,7,30 June 2013
The Wolverine," The Wolverine is A Good Movie!
","The film takes as reference the graphic novel by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller where Wolverine goes to Japan despite the film having caught this plot which is held at HQ I, Wolverine, the film is not 100% the same as the comics have many differences, however the film brings their own qualities. The film follows as a direct continuation of the third film of the Trilogy X-Men 3 The Last Stand, the course of the film it is possible to note how Logan is upset because of what happened to Jean Grey, at various times he has dreams about her and this serves as a settling into the fabric to form a unique personality of the character. Soon the beginning of the film is very exciting, however in the course of the movie experience becomes different, Wolverine loses his healing factor and leaves the film tiring for an extended period and really gives up sleep, it's boring. In the final moments of the film, the experience improves again as the film becomes exciting. During the film is shown a considerable amount and characters each with their personalities, the action is also very good both the Primary and Secondary Characters, Mariko (Tao Okamoto) has a key role in the plot, but on occasion lose direction and is all unbalanced, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) Encorporou the character very well. The fight scenes though few are excellent, nothing too much blood and be headings as many would like to see, but are exciting. there is a good amount of times that portrays the Japanese culture during the entire movie dialogs with locals are entirely in Japanese which demonstrates a tone of originality. the soundtrack is OK, we have some very exciting music, and special effects also OK, we also villains like the Viper and the Silver Samurai, both are compelling. And by the end, be sitting in the chair until the end because we have a post credits scene, it is Incredible! one of the most exciting scenes ever made into a movie, which is directly linked to the next movie Mutants: X-Men Days of Future Past. In order Wolverine: Immortal is a good movie despite some flaws in the film as the wearing parts and even the very fabric of the plot and the film does not fail to be good, and no doubt is a film that represents the character pretty well. although not what many would like to see, the film has its qualities.",7,4,9,1 August 2013
