The Legend of Bagger Vance," A question re: locations
","First, I loved this movie. The themes are rather timeless, really - redemption, mystery, fair play, doing the right thing - it's all there.But there were a few snafus that confuse me. The main one is this: the narrator (Jack Lemmon) collapses, tells his story, then walks into the sunset on the golf course. Except this is in S. GA or S. Carolina. Sun doesn't set in the EAST, I can't think that any of the islands off the coast of GA are that far off the mainland that you can see a sunset over never-ending water, but maybe I'm wrong. So, what WAS that supposed to be? I guess the filmmakers are so used to S. CA that they figured viewers wouldn't notice. It's just a small thing that's bugged me from the get-go.",10,1,3,24 February 2009
