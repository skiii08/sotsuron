Hereditary," Overhyped rubbish
","I went to see this film based on reviews of people who have seen the film and the 'star' rating given by publications like Empire and Total Film.
The first hour nothing much happened. I thought setting things up for the second hour when things will take off. Wrong! The second hour was a boring as the first. The film boils down to a witches coven trying to give life a demon in a human host. It so bad in parts that the audience including me were sniggering. See it done better than this film. 
Toni Collette I thought was good which is the only reason it got two stars. Apart from her the rest of the cast including Gabriel Byrne was completely forgettable.
I can't believe Empire magazine which I place a great deal of reliance to provide a rating which truly reflects how good / bad a film is, got this soooo wrong for this film. Also, how other people scored this film more than three stars at best is beyond me.",2,11,28,21 June 2018
