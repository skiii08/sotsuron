Hereditary," Worst movie of my life
","First of all, I'm not those overreacting guys who gives Shawshank Redemption 10 or Avengers Infinity War 1 out of 10. This is my first review in here. This review is to warn you guys. Don't bother watch this movie and save 2 hours of you're life. This is the worst movie of my life. I only watched it till the end to know the plot and thought it was one of those late action type movies. But like the rest of the movie, it disappointed me also in the end. After the movie, I only kept thinking how could you make such a bad movie. Like even I can do better than that!I'm not gonna go details on why and how bad this movie is. If you don't heed my warning and still start to watch it, stop as soon as it gets boring. Don't wait for things to get better/hot/scary. Cause it never will.",1,1,4,28 August 2018
