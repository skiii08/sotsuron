The Ring," One of the most genuinely scary movies ever made
","I hardly ever have the motivation to come on here and comment on a movie, but this one is worth that effort. I am a massive fan of horror movies and films of intrigue.  I can easily say that The Ring is way up on my top ten list of scary movies.  And I mean scary movies. There are horror films which are just great thrillers, like Seven and the Hannibal trilogy and others like Friday 13th or Scream that are inventive in their death scenes.  Then there are the very few that genuinely jolt and unnerve you, prompting you to cover your eyes with your hands and make your heart leap like on a rollercoaster. Films like The Shining and Fire Walk With Me.   This is definitely one of those.I have not seen the Japanese original so I cannot offer a comparison, but this US version pulled off what in my opinion is one one of the most chilling movies ever made.  The ending itself makes your jaw drop and leaves it dragging on the floor all the way out the theatre.",10,0,0,11 November 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," I'm a fan of the first two but this was
","Awful.  The fight sequence between Smith and Neo at the end is so-so, but nothing compared to what we've seen in Matrix 1 and 2.  The rest of the film consists of yawn-inducing CGI failing miserably to spruce up some seen-it-all-before battle sequences, plus an odd mix of stupid and pseudo-intellectual dialogue,  clich√©s and boring characters. Keanu barely gets a look-in.One of the worst movies of the year.  Unfortunately the filmmakers will still undeservedly congratulate each other on the movie's success - it will do well purely because it's the 3rd part in a trilogy.",4,0,0,9 November 2003
