Ali," this movie disappointed me
","i was expecting to see a great movie ,but this movie is just completely different of what i thought it would be. It seems the movie is made with episodes ,but this episodes have nothing in common (the ones that saw the movie will understand).And besides that ,we don't learn much things about Ali's life . the only great thing is Will Smith. i give it a 6/10",6,0,0,18 March 2002
