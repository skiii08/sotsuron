Minority Report," of burgers and jet-packs (contains spoilers)
","i can understand why this movie got lots of great reviews. it has many wonderful elements. i figured out early on that crow had taken/killed anderton's son. i was *tremendously* relieved, and surprised, that it was a plot twist and not the real story. big-budget hollywood has become so god-awful predictable and stupid that i was gratified when it wasn't entirely so.that said. this movie is full of story problems, bad acting, and inappropriate editing. i cannot believe the same man that made 'schindler's list' also made 'minority report,' 'the goonies,' and 'hook.'spielberg seems to have a talent for getting the worst possible performances out of actors. some of the acting in this movie was so bad or uneven it was stunning. i just looked up lois smith (dr. hineman) b/c she was particularly heinous. of course! she's a veteran soap/tv actor.multiple problems include:* witwer's one-scene complete 180 degree character flip from pompus, unskilled, unethical, careless idiot to expert, insightful detective.* anderton's eyes broadcast his presence until they are out of his head. then they suddenly become untraceable skeleton keys using the security clearance of someone who is no longer a cop. and his unrefrigerated retinas don't seem to ever decompose.* the bizarre and meaningless 'eye-doctor/nurse' soliloquy/monologue. he has no possible reason to help anderton (who has underpaid for the service and should be an object of vengeance) unless it's the implied: he's grateful for being turned on to prison sex. lame!* the completely unforgivable jet-pack burger scene. while anderton escapes by crashing through an apartment building riding a cop and his jet-pack we are treated to a close-up of the jet-pack cooking the burgers on the stove while the tenant screams Shoo like they were bats or something. man!expletives could not convey my disdain. slapstick?  in the middle of a 'serious' film? unconnected to any other part of the film (with the possible exception of the nearly as challenged chase-the-eyeballs-down-the-ramp-scene)?i beg you, do not reward this thing or its creators any more than we already have by buying tickets. do not buy this on video and do not recommend it.",1,16,29,20 August 2002
The Fifth Element," Hudson Hawk II
","I can't really improve over the title of this review. It was disjointed, hyperbolic, slapstick with cartoon sound effects and yet managed to be ridiculous, impossible to care about, and incapable of cooperating in the willing suspension of any kind, shape, or form of disbelief. If you liked 'Hudson Hawk,' you might like this too. It has a slightly stronger odor of plot at least.",1,12,26,25 April 2002
