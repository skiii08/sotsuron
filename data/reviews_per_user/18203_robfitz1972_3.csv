Walk the Line," A Worthy Tribute
","Biopics are notoriously difficult subjects, but this film benefits not only from having such an enigmatic character in Johnny Cash, but his story is nothing short of compelling.The music performances are excellent, especially 'Jackson' which holds a candle to the original. And I love the way that the Luther Perkins character (subtly played by Dan John Miller) creates the riff for 'Folsom Prison Blues' during the audition for Sam Phillips.The acting performances are also exceptional throughout. Joaquin Phoenix captures the troubled spirit of one who lost his elder brother at a tragically young age (maybe drawing on his own experiences at the passing of his brother River). I have always rated Reese Witherspoon as an actress, but her performance as June Carter is a revelation. It's a shame she seems to settle for romantic comic leads, maybe an Oscar win might change that.Highly recommended for anyone, regardless of whether you are a fan (like I am) or not (like my wife). Word of warning though, don't expect strong impressions of supporting characters such as Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis. This is not Stars In Their Eyes.",8,0,0,8 February 2006
Cars," Full throttle and a change of direction for Pixar
","Dedicated to Joe Ranft, collaborator in just about all of the Pixar movies, there is a distinct change of mood here. A PG certificate for an animated feature is unusual, but then Cars is something of a grown up movie, focusing heavily on Lightning McQueen's long road to redemption. At almost 2 hours, it is also long for an animated feature.But as there are a plethora of computer animated films doing the rounds at the moment, usually following the formula of casting a few stars, creating a few quirky characters and an average script, then Pixar have always tried to remain one step of the competition. In Cars, they have succeeded with a sound script, brilliant humanisation of a cast full of vehicles and stunning animation, especially with the racing sequences and the backdrop for Radiator Springs, the remote town where Lightning McQueen is convicted and sentenced to a community service that involves repairing the road he had damaged by his own recklessness.There are moments of fun to be had here, like the flatulent tractors and Mater, the worn down breakdown truck, actually swearing in one scene. But these are few and far between in what is a very serious film. Still, given the circumstances of Ranft's demise, it is perhaps a miracle that the project was even completed. Ultimately, it is unfair to compare Cars with previous Pixar successes as it is so different, even though it is essentially the same team behind this film, with Randy Newman brought in for soundtrack duty and the customary continuation of what happened afterwards during the credits which raises perhaps more laughs than the rest of the film put together.Without giving too much away, this is an excellent film. Perhaps not one for the kids though.",8,0,0,3 August 2006
Munich," Spielberg Back On Track
","After the disappointment of War of The Worlds, let down by some hammy acting and a weak storyline, Munich goes a long way towards restoring Spielberg's reputation. Based on Mossad's response to the siege and killing of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics, this is a near flawless piece.The storyline is excellent, relying heavily on family/nation imagery throughout, from when Avner meets Golda Meir, the Israeli Prime Minister who remembers his father and comments on his wife's pregnancy, to Avner being disenfranchised from Mossad and missing out on the upbringing of his daughter.The acting performances bring together some quality actors, such as Ciaran Hinds, Daniel Craig, the legendary Michel Lonsdale and the ever consistent Geoffrey Rush. Although he does not have the same reputation, Eric Bana's performance as an assassin and family man is excellent. Ruthless in his duty, his softer side comes to the fore when he hears his daughter's first words over the phone, arguably the most heart wrenching scene in the film.But what is most impressive is the attention to detail to what is a period piece. The mixture of original ABC archive footage with reconstruction of the siege is eerily accurate. The scenes of all of the locations is truly a step back to the 70s, even down to the inclusion of the World Trade Centre in New York.At 2 and a half hours, this one long film. But the drama is so unrelenting that the time whizzes by. And for such a violent film, the futility of violence is given considerable emphasis. Spielberg can take pride in this piece of work. He'll now have a hell of a job on his hands to follow this up. But if Munich wins the Best Picture Oscar, will he care?",8,2,3,17 February 2006
