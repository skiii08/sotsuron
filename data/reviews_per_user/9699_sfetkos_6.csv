Blade Runner 2049," Fascinating a the beginning, slow and boring as it continues
","So you are a scifi lover. Then blade Runner comes out, so many critics, reviews such an amazing score on IMDb (8.6), fantastic trailer, great and promising cast. BUT? There is a big 'but' in this whole movie. When the movie starts it is amazing, CGI's are great, fantastic atmosphere of the destructed world of the 2049 keeps you going and everything seems so interesting. There is one problem, even if though the story progresses, there are MANY points which are so slow and dull that destroy the whole movie. The movie should have moved forward faster in some points and have more action instead. Most action scenes are amazing but we needed more. At the end of the movie I had a sore butt because the movie was long and boring. Sorry but this is the truth.",5,29,61,12 October 2017
Us," This movie is so bad, it made me write a review again
","Where can I start? The bad 'cloned' characters acting? The lousy script? The horrendous ending? I really do not know what is worst. If you really want to waste 2 hours of your life and never have them back then you should watch this movie. I cannot believe that this movie was also nominated for something, maybe it should be nominated for Golden Raspberry's. If there was a ZERO score I would select it. The story is boring, slow, predictive and wrapped up with the terrible acting (yes I said that before) it makes a 'horror' movie that tries to scares us with mental cloned people dressed dressed in red suits with scissors and Luniz 'I got five on it' as background music.",1,2,6,5 August 2019
Midnight in Paris," Watch this ONLY if you are fan of Woody Allen movies...
","Do not be tricked from the high score of IMDb. People that have voted that high are probably Woody Allen's movies fans. This movie is horrible, it hardly gets 3 out of 10 points. As you have guessed I hate Woody Allen's movies. I was tricked from the high rating of this movie but after I watched it I found it shallow, boring, with no-taste and without any purpose nor meaning. The main character is a boring-writer that has been castrated by his woman and is living in a boring-dreamworld. I forgot to mention the annoying music that keeps playing in the background and the endless background scenes of Paris. Watch this only if you want to waste your time.",1,8,27,28 November 2011
Ex Machina," Mumbo jumbo non-sense in a low-budget sci-fi
","I am not going to analyze like the other bad reviewers the android, the construction of it and the intelligence. Look you watch a movie. You go with the flow of the movie. As a sci-fi lover I go with the flow of the movie, I do not ask so many questions or analyze the film, I try to relax and enjoy. BUT! This movie never blew my mind. I LOVE SCI-FI movies but this movie, even thought signed by Universal is a low- budget movie with just 4 actors. No action, no special effects for you Sci- Fi lovers. This movie is blunt and based on the pointless scenario and low-class acting. Sorry guys I only got more horny from the Japanese actress than the rest of the movie. To summarize this pointless movie is about a multi-millionaire who builds a robot and selects a programmer to be his tester. Wow this multi-millionaire OWNS a company like go ogle and writes on POST-IT's (which we never got an explanation about that). Also this Android (Ava) has an internet search engine (go ogle) as a mind/database and asks silly questions. Oh yea. I forgot AI got dumb. This movie is very similar to 'The Machine' (2013); same depressing music/atmosphere/concept. Sorry this is a no-no from me. Sci-Fi lovers stay away an save your time to watch something else.",2,4,13,13 June 2015
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," So many fine actors in such a bad movie (supposed to be comedy)
","If IMDb had a negative scoring I would give it to this movie. This movie is so boring and depressing that I find it a completely waste of time. I thought comedies supposed to be funny. Well is definitely not a comedy, more like a sci-fi stupid drama about a loser actor in Broadway that cannot find a proper actors to cooperate with and he is by the way a superhero. Movie is boring (did I say that?) music that plays during the movie is completely annoying (with this stupid drums like its some sophisticated comedy). If you like wanna-be comedies and you are over 80 and have nothing else to do with your life maybe you will like this crap. DO NOT WATCH A COMPLETE WASTE OF YOUR TIME AND MONEY!",1,26,52,8 February 2015
Fast Five," Great Action movie for Fast & Furious fans
","Great action scenes, destroyed cars and mayhem. These words describe the movie best. More or less you know what's gonna happen at the end but there are key facts that this movie is a successor. The direction of the film is great, even in the most unrealistic scenes you can feel the tense in which case you feel certain that you're actually physically there. I think that the fun part begins on the second half of the movie. And of course I must not forget to mention the epic fight between Luke Hobbs 'The Rock' & Vin Diesel 'XXX'. (I wish Luke Hobbs wore less Sun Tanning Lotion & Baby-Oil. A personal remark to Mr Hobbs: 'You look too shiny dude.. relax!! We know you got muscles!'). Besides some minor mistakes and some bad acting I think that this movie is worth watching.",7,0,1,5 December 2011
