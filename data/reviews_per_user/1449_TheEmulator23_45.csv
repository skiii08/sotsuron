The Blair Witch Project," overrated garbage
","This film is and always will be remembered for it's vomited inducing camera work.  Not only is the camera work terrible, but all the hype that was involved in this picture, was pure idiocy.  I really have no idea why anyone thought this film was anything worth seeing.  A film student could have put out a better picture than this in one week of shooting.  To prove my point, have we heard of any of the so-called actors ever since?  I think not. Forgive me the girl did have a part in the Jason Biggs bomb, aptly titled Loser.",2,4,7,25 September 2002
The King's Speech," 3 Oscar acting Nominations for sure.
","This is easily one of the best films of the year. Overall it has been a terrible year for movies besides a few exceptions. Granted I haven't seen some of the favorites such as 'The Fighter,' but overall people & the movie industry wonders why they were down in profits? It wasn't because we didn't have money (we had less last year!) it's because the selection for the most part stunk. I predict this film will get a minimum of 6-8 Oscar nominations this year. Colin Firth is about as close to a shoo-in bet for a nomination I'd bet on it if it was in Vegas. Perhaps he will win, but I'm not sure. Geoffrey Rush will get nominated, but I felt that he was in the movie too much to be stuck in the same category as Helena Bonham-Carter (who will also get a Nom.) for Supporting Actor. I usually don't notice musical scores as most of them are completely...well they're just there. I thought this score was excellent. I think it is a shoo-in for Best Picture & should get a Best Director & hopefully screenplay nod as well.My only suggestion is that most kids under the age of 21 won't appreciate it & find it boring. That's fine but when you're tired of watching Garbage like the 'Step Up' movies or have to watch stuff explode over and over & it is completely devoid of a plot, come back to this. You'll be glad you did, if not for Colin Firths' performance alone.",9,1,2,3 January 2011
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Worse than the highly profitable first.
","This has such a great cast & special effects that you wonder just how this & the first can be so bad! I can't believe that the first made so much money $347 million & this one almost made half a BILLION WORLD-WIDE! I hate to think that has a society we are not only getting lazy in our story-telling, we are all willing to accept it! This film's plot which again seemed like a cool idea like the first did and yet...boring. First off the cast is probably one of the best you could have, but they have nothing to do but act surprised about who knows what, but not the script that is for sure. If you liked the very dumb first I'm sure you'll love this very good idea, yet poorly written, executed, & plain ol' dumb movie. I would hate to think Walt Disney having anything to do with this hack film, yet they continually pump out these mediocre if not well financed flicks. If you want to see a good Nic Cage film, try watching his amazing non-special effects film 'Leaving Las Vegas' where he won his Oscar. Oh I guess we have to have every single film with CGI now. Please skip this very mildly entertaining film. Unless you're 12, then I'm sure you won't care about plot.",4,2,5,28 May 2008
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Weird, disturbing, poor acts, great costumes.
","I like all of the main actors involved in this quite bizarre film. Terrance Stamp, Guy Pearce & Hugo Weaving have all proved themselves as some of the best & most capable actors around, but I could not get into this. I don't know if it's because I don't understand the lifestyle or what, but I could not get my head around this film. Worse than anything is that the actors made some of the ugliest drag queens I've ever seen. I think that was part of the point, I don't know. I realize that is probably an insult, but I don't know what else to call them. I must say I bought the guys as the performers (the correct term?) but the story just wasn't very good or very interesting either. I will say that I can't usually appreciate costume designers very well, although I notice them when they are wrong or out of place, but I was very much impressed with these. Very creative to say the least, just not attractive, but I don't think they're supposed to be. I don't know I am definitely not the target audience and would never go see a performance done by these kind of performers, but I wouldn't go see ballet, or opera either so I don't know. If this is your kind of film then you will probably like it, but if it's not skip it because it is...well not for most of us. I just checked it won the Oscar for costume design & I will say rightfully so. I must say Ebert didn't care much for this film either, though he liked it better than I did.",4,3,14,1 February 2009
The Sound of Music," Except for the music, well it's just good...not great.
","I remember this film of course for the music but especially when you're a kid you overlook story-telling. Just like everyone else this music is some of the best ever put in a movie. It's funny how everyone seems to forget that just how absurd and unbelievable a lot of it is. For example the kids go from hating her to liking her in an extremely short time. Strangely enough, this movie is long & yes even some of the musical numbers drag it out longer than it needs to be. There is a lot of fun to be had especially for children & big fans of musicals. If you are willing to forget some of the weaker story-lines (I get it it's a G movie) but the Nazi's hardly play any significant or actually scary bad guys even compared to other G-Rated films. Still this as really good movie & I wish I would have just stuck to remembering how great it was when I saw it as a kid.",7,2,10,25 August 2008
Underworld," Good looking film.
","First off a film that only cost 30 million, but looks like it cost twice that!  Let me meet the crew!  Really the film was very well done, and a worthy 1st effort.  I don't think this will be the last of the Underworld Saga.  There is so much more to explore, especially in prequel terms!  I would love to see it or even write it!  Good job to all involved!",7,1,2,6 January 2004
Iron Man 2," Not Bad, but not good either, it's just missing something.
","This was extremely mediocre in the biggest way a film can be. The story. It's barely there at all. Everything about the film was top notch, the acting the special effects, the set pieces etc. However it just goes to show that unless you have a good story & a good script, there is something missing. You never get invested in the story even for a second. That was what made the first film what it was, a really fun & engaging storyline. This had absolutely none of that whatsoever. It wasn't that it was bad, it just wasn't good. The word of mouth on this will spread (badly) & I would be shocked if this makes as much as the first film which relied on the excellent word of mouth to make it such a successful & very well reviewed film. It seemed like they really should have made the script the most important part of the film. Mickey Rourke did the best he was given, but he just wasn't an interesting/scary bad guy at all. Especially comparing to Jeff Bridges of the first film. I wish people would stop comparing this so much to the first film & stop rating it so high based on that film. If you hadn't seen the first, it doesn't hold up well as a standalone film. In fact if this was the first 'Iron Man' It would be doubtful we would have seen a second film. On a good note Robert Downey Jr. is good to an extent, but they should have let his own personality shine through even more as he is the reason people love the character. Unless you're a die hard 'Iron Man' fan you will find little to want to watch this more than once.",5,2,5,10 May 2010
Alien: Resurrection," Better as time goes
","I am probably biased, OK not probably... I am, but this film was better when you see the directors cut as part of the Alien Quadrilogy, with half-assed special effects and all. Is it a classic, well no it it is not, but compared to all the crap that came out in 2005, well yeah it could be considered a decent film. I am willing to be that Joss, (Whedon that is who wrote the screenplay I believe) has had many more ideas of what else he could have changed and/or added since he wrote this many years ago. All in all if you are a fan of what Ridley Scott's original 1979 'Alien' was or James Cameron's 'Aliens' and even David Fichners 'Alien 3' you will enjoy this film. I know myself and others would go and watch every single 'Alien' film even if they made 50 of them. Sigourney seemed to kind of phoned this one in as well as Winona, (even though Winona really seemed to try, she was just not suited and or believable in her role.) The main problem to me seemed that there were way too many throw-away characters. Granted in a film like this we know that most of them are not going to make it, but it just seemed like they weren't trying to give any sort of personality at all. I have seen much worse and all in all this is not a bad film, hell the whole mutant 'Ripley' lab thing as been made fun of and teased to death, so obviously people enjoyed parts of this film at the very least! If the ever do make a 5th film, it needs to be focused more on the 'Aliens' and have very little to do with Ripley's character, if at all. If you love the original, at least see the sequels, (especially the sequel 'Aliens') so you know what else is left in this franchise so it can be possibly resurrected. It is looking less and less likely now that it has been almost 10 years since the last film. I just hope that this isn't abandoned because there are so many more stories that we have not explored yet. But when in doubt thank the original director Ridley for welcoming us to a new type of film and has had a bunch of copycats since, but no one can come close to this original.",7,4,5,14 January 2006
The Other Boleyn Girl," Stick to the still superior show 'The Tudors.'
","The acting is pretty good, Natalie Portman stands out as usual. She is a naturally gifted actress and has only gotten better since her debut in 'The Professional.' My main complaint and although this is a movie it takes way too much liberty as far as the falsehood of the stories. 'The Tudors' on Showtime though is guilty of the same, but this just was too far-fetched an actually absurd in places. It just goes to show that time and time again that people love their soap opera stories and find history to be too boring on it's own. I think that is a pity and believe that we don't actually need to have fake stories to make history interesting. If you actually want to learn anything don't bother watching this. I give credit to the actors doing the best they could with this pretty mediocre at best script. Again watch 'The Tudors' for a little bit better history & the same excellent production values.",6,0,0,5 July 2008
The Others," Nichole's best work to date!
","I think this picture is just wonderful. It shows that you don't need special effects to scare the crap out of someone. I must say that without Nicholes and those kids (whoever they are) this film would have just been another 40 mil. grossing pic. Because of Nichole this film was so scary, the only other that has scared me like this was 'The Eye' a terrifying film from over in Asia, directed by (I think the Pang brothers)- and the original 'Candyman' (of course I was 12 then, and did the whole Candyman thing in the mirror more than once) I just know that even after I had seen it a couple times, I still got freaked out even though I knew the result. Maybe it is just me, but I know how very rare it is to get shocked and/or surprised by a PG-13 film, especially these days. Bravo to all involved.",8,0,2,2 June 2005
Insomnia," Too long to set up
","This was a decent thriller, but overall the setup was painstakingly slow. Williams was credited 2nd, well where was he for the 1st hour?  Don't get me wrong christopher nolans memento was brilliant, but this was a tired slow film.",5,0,1,29 May 2002
Juno," Didn't believe the hype, I was very very wrong. (Unusually)
","Well I never did see this because the new thing seems to be the huge promotion on the little independents. I thought 'Little Miss Sunshine' was promoted fantastically for a very mediocre film. I held out longer than anyone because I was sure this was another of the so-called independents that wasn't worth it. However the script is very much like 'South Park' with a lot of it's irreverent although oftentimes both true and sound like I still talk. (Yes I will be saying Dude probably till the day I die) I related to all of the characters, and thought that they were very similar to the way I felt and many of my friends did as well while in High School. I will never doubt Jason Reitman again, although Diablo Cody's script is great, I'm still not convinced w/her. Reitman however did the absolutely excellent (yet very little seen) 'Thank You for Smoking' which everyone should see. That is just my two cents, and please take it from a guy who has seen more movies in his lifetime than everyone I've ever known combined. OK that sounded braggy, but I watch a minimum of 2 a night.",10,3,8,5 May 2008
Final Destination 2," good laugh horror
","This is probably one of the few horror movies that i laughed at, but was grossed out at, at the same time.  I enjoyed the 1st one immensely, but this one just was better in my eyes.  I knew what was going to happen to them, i just didn't know how!  Just knowing that alone made this for a very entertaining film.  It also had the best highway crash sequence i have ever seen.  I sure hope they make a 3rd.  Maybe have AJ cooks character be like Ali larters.",7,0,0,26 July 2003
The Last Legion," A waste of time, but even a bigger waste of the talent.
","This is absolute garbage. There is so much about this that is a tragedy in that 'I feel sorry for the actors involved' kinda way. I don't understand how you get all of these obviously talented (yet not in this) actors to be in this crap. The cast list alone is tremendous. You have Sir Ben Kingsley, Colin Firth, Kevin McKidd (the star of HBO's excellent 2 years only but it was really expensive and the 2nd season wasn't as good as the first show ROME) Peter Mullan, Alexander Siddig (George Clooney's Syriana) and no Aishwarya Rai is pretty but she can't act doesn't add to anything at this point. Terrible run-on sentence I know but back to this so-called movie. I didn't find any of this entertaining and how this even made it past the development stage I cannot understand. The acting is a joke, the script is absolutely laughable, so much of the dialog is so bad you think you're watching 'Power Rangers,' and last but not least the special effects are as bad as a Saturday night Sci-Fi channel movie! If this is the only movie you have seen on the legend of Excalibur, hurry up and forget it because It doesn't do any sort of justice to the legend. It's tag line is 'Before King Arthur, there was Excalibur.' Please do not let that fool you. It is the worst movie any of these actors have probably ever done, and it is even worse than an Oscar winner (Ben Kingsley 1982 Gandhi) now has one more terrible movie to add to his resume. The other one of course is the Uwe Boll (the worst director of all time) movie BloodRayne. If you want to see a good film watch 'Sexy Beast.' Now that is a good Ben Kingsley movie. 2/10",2,2,5,27 January 2008
The Caine Mutiny," A good film, made great by Bogart!
","I have never been a big fan of Humphrey Bogart, but am just now getting some of the depth of his work as I grow older. This film is excellent, and seeing the slow decay of Bogarts character is something to behold. I think w/out his powerhouse performance this would have just been a decent film. It is made excellent just by the layers particularly in the end of just how hard it really must have been being a commander of a Destroyer during WWII. It also shows how hard it must be to have to put your full faith in a man commanding you. It shows that even the strongest of men can sometimes be pushed too far when it comes to war. It is also great to see so many later great actors (Lee Marvin, Fred Macmurray) in small roles in this film learning and acting w/ one of the best.",9,0,1,14 May 2007
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," Very mildly entertaining at the most.
","This is a harmless movie w/no real redeeming value & cardboard cutouts of all the characters. Worse than anything is the fact that the terrific voice cast is completely wasted which is a shame. In fact if Ben Stiller & Chris Rock had lent themselves w/some of their creative talent, this could have been a much better film. Hell an episode of 'Everybody hates Chris' has more heart & laughs than this entire film. I think most kids will enjoy this, but it won't be anything lasting. What reminded me more than anything is the fact that this seemed like a wannabe 'Lion King' but w/out the re-watchability & the fantastic story. Again this is a extremely mediocre film that wasted the great voice talents & a boring pointless plot too.",5,3,9,14 January 2009
Dreamgirls," Totally Overrated and extremely repetitive...oh yeah and Boring!
","I don't know what the fuss is about this film. (I despised 'Chicago') I especially don't understand how Jennifer Hudson won an Oscar for her work. Granted she did make Beyonce look very bad, but c'mon an Oscar for this? She held her own OK, but Oscar worthy, not even close! If it weren't for the pretty decent singing and the excellent songs, and the fact that it is loosely based on 'The Supremes,' this never would have been made. This was pretty much a waste of time, and unless you love musicals and don't care about the poor acting, (Eddie Murphy was pretty good, Jamie Foxx was totally miscast here, Danny Glover's character was totally wasted which was a shame) Do not believe all the hype. I hate it when people will love something just because they loved it in it's previous incarnation. (This based on a Broadway musical.) You have to judge it for what it is now, which was a very poor film. Don't waste your time or just watch Eddie Murphys scenes, and listen to some of the pretty much excellent music. I think a 4/10 is pretty generous of a score too. Out of 4 stars, I would give this 1 1/2 out of 4 it's that poor.",4,1,3,2 May 2007
Quantum of Solace," Rich in Action, Poor in plot.
","This is one of the most brainless Bond films in a series full of Brainlessness movies. Unfortunately that is saying a lot, as Pierce's last film as Bond was pretty absurd, but in a good way. These films w/Craig seem to be taking themselves more seriously so they in turn they need a little more plot & less fluff. Like others said this is a darker film & it shows. Some say Craig's Bond is just bubbling w/anger, but I saw it as a plain ol' thinly written. Now everyone rages about 'Casino Royale' but I never saw it more than a good film & definitely not the best Bond film. This is a decent film & the action sequences are absolutely superb. Unfortunately that doesn't make up for the lack of a story. For those that haven't seen 'Royale' or even seen it recently, it would really help seeing that before this. It would help you enjoy this film a lot more. For the die hard Bond fan's this will please you to a certain extent, & for those that don't know the series very well well you will be pleased w/the action to say the least.",6,0,1,1 April 2009
JFK," Excellent character study w/interesting if not altogether right.
","I will start by saying that I am not sure what exactly the truth is about the assassination of JFK. There are many theories and many conspiracy theories and tons of inaccuracies & probably some cover-ups as well. I will say that I am not a conspiracy nut like all of those that think we didn't land on the moon, (those that believe otherwise well I'm sorry you are just ignorant, try studying history please) that the Holocaust didn't happen, & that 9/11 was somehow caused by something other than terrorists. I do believe that just like this excellent film says there were perhaps other people and things that caused the killing of JFK. I consider myself a very well read historian (especially WWII) and of all of the big events that have happened in history, I am most unsure about the ACTUAL truth about JFK. Just as Oliver Stone says in this overlong film, he has some pretty ridiculous & extremely far-fetched ideas, but he also has some excellent points & just how bad the investigation was & how quickly just 1 man was blamed for the death of the president. It seems very unlikely that Lee Harvey Oswald was solely responsible. It probably isn't true that Cuba had so much involvement into what happened, but it is very interesting that Oswald himself was killed by Jack Ruby before he could speak everything that he might have known. If you are a conspiracy nut and believe everything is a conspiracy well I guess you have to have something to live for & I'm sure you will think that Stone has everything correct in this mostly fictional but very well written and thought out movie. So enjoy this for what it is, but please form your own opinion & actually study the facts. I have a feeling that what had happened had a lot to do w/ JFK's ideas & his dealings with the fiasco that was the bay of pigs & the whole situation with the U.S.S.R & the failed plot to kill Castro & overthrow communism everywhere we felt threatened.",7,1,11,6 July 2008
Hellboy," For a far-fetched Sci-Fi Flick, Surprisingly Deep!
","I don't think it's just me buy this flick was really deep in surprising places. It deals w/ past issues, the problems of how we look are a little explored, the depression of and issues of being picked on for being different, and the surprising violence, that children do on each other, the list goes on and on. It also had such great scenes and dialog, with the child on the roof and when Hellboy says just how he feels about Liz in a sort of clumsy yet romantic way like us mortals would probably do. It's really a great film for everyone, If it weren't for some of the great basic NAZI scenes and the well done action sequences, this could be watched by all. Leave it to G. Del Toro to make a could've been crappy adaptation very memorable and sticking to his guns to get the perfectly cast Ron Perlman (The Studio wanted someone well know and more 'Bankable') to create such a film. Can't wait for the sequel, and loved the fact that 'Pan's Labyrinth' won Academy Awards, and got him even more well know/loved by others. My favorite scene, when he takes his hand and looks into Liz's eyes and says so convincingly 'I wish I could do something about this' meaning his face/look. Watch Watch Watch! It's great.",8,2,2,23 July 2007
Stardust," A good looking film, but wasted in it's bland story.
","This was a gorgeous looking film but there was no payoff. Now I love Robert De Niro, but him acting as a fruit was not only not funny, it was plain embarrassing and totally out of place. I realize he is probably trying new roles, but this was plain terrible. I thought the acting was also very good, but the overall script was the same thing I've seen hundred times, but done better. I think children will like all the fireworks and good special effects, but people that have seen lots of better films will just find this film to be blah. There is absolutely nothing standout about this film. I've missed Michelle Pfieffer and it was good to see her back in films, but I think she was wasted trying to do the best she could with what the script gave her. Which was absent, and would have been that much worse of a film with a lesser actress. Don't waste your time or your money, when you can see the performers in other better films.",5,13,26,13 August 2007
I Am Legend," The most overrated movie of 2007!
","I like Will Smith quite a bit, but as good as he is in this flick, that alone does not make a good film! It seems so many are giving this such high ratings just because of some of the cool sequences, such as overgrown deserted New York, him playing golf off a military jet, and seeing a lion and there prey roam NY. I should remind you people that just because you have good effects that does not make a movie! This is so dragged out and utterly pointless I just kept hoping it would get better; it didn't. There is some good shots and I can't stand shaky cam very much, but even this is done well. Please don't watch this unless you want a pretty mediocre flick. I will give Will the only reason that this has done a decent. Don't watch this. It is utterly and completely overrated. In fact, if this didn't star Will Smith, it would have been totally panned and no one would have seen it.",5,10,17,7 January 2008
Kick-Ass," Fun Parts, but in the top 250 of all time C'mon.
","I enjoyed parts of the film including my favorite sequence shot First Person Shooter style. That was cool filmmaking & wish it would have been done a little longer. Some of the acting was just plain bad too. The lead kid, was really not lead material whatsoever. I realize an 11 year old girl can be trained to be pretty emotionless if she is raised in such a way. ***SPOILER*** However after she loses her dad, her pretty much lack of any sort of sadness is kind of pushing it. After all she's still a kid who only has her father. ***END SPOILER*** As many have already said the star of the movie is the girl Chloe Moretz as 'Hit Girl'. She is a superstar in the making as long as she matures well & picks the right roles ('Let Me In' is a step in the right direction!) & doesn't go the Lindsay Lohan route. We all thought Dakota Fanning would still be something today, but she has landed into more supporting roles & dare I say it, not as good an actress as when she was younger. One of the best things of the movie is that despite the budget only being $30 million it looks like it cost double or triple that. Why can't we have some of those sorts of people that can keep the costs down, working for the gov't, so we can get out of this Trillion dollar debt. That's right Gov't service isn't nearly as fun & doesn't pay as well. It's a good film, but to be rated above 'The Princess Bride' is quite simply insulting. Now I know nothing of the comic I purely judge a film on what makes a good film, a good script, acting, character interactions, directing, so on and so forth. This is not an 8 or even a 7, more like a 6.5.",6,1,4,18 August 2010
Transformers," Looks fantastic on Blu-Ray, Despite story
","This is a complete guilty pleasure for me. No it isn't a great film & Megan Fox is nothing more than eye candy but damn she looks good, although kind of whorish, but that's OK w/me. The sound, special effects & the huge set pieces are what make this a fun film. As good as it was in theaters it looks just as good @ home w/the Blu-Ray. Crank up the sound & wow it sounds cool. I have a Wide Screen 37 inch TV but man I bet my rating would be even higher if I had a 50 plus one. I am looking forward to the sequel as it looks even bigger and better & I'm sure when it hit's Blu-Ray it will be kick-butt! Even if you didn't like the film, this is a perfect film to watch on Blu-Ray that is for sure. Get this Used & watch the great sequences especially the end as it looks and sounds superior especially compared to the now defunct regular DVD. Skip some of the relatively dumb plot & watch the robots kick each others butts because it is very cool. Nothing but praise but I gave it 2 extras stars just because of the excellence of the Blu-Ray experience.",8,0,1,20 May 2009
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Wasted opportunity w/less than mediocre storytelling.
","This was film I was looking forward to, but I found it to be extremely generic & plain boring. Granted there are lots of Holocaust movies just not usually from the point of view of a child. I have been told that the book is a fantastic read. I guess it was all lost in translation. One of my main complaints was how these characters are all cardboard cutouts. I know David Thewlis & Vera Farmiga can act, but they are completely wasted having pretty much nothing to do. The adaptation from the book is done extremely poorly & the direction is really bland as well. Unfortunately this is the same director that did one of the worst movies ever made in 'Blame it on the Bellboy.' I don't know why but although this is barely 90 minutes long it still seemed extremely long. There are a lot better movies about this subject so skip this. Try watching the superbly done 5 part documentary/re-enactments (good re-enactments too) 'Auschwitz: The Nazis and the Final Solution.' You can get a lot more entertainment & learn something at the same time. 'The Boy in the Striped Pajamas' however has nothing new to say.",4,4,10,17 April 2009
Paranormal Activity," Not scary, in fact quite boring.
","I liked the fact that it was so cheaply made, but man it was completely overrated in every respect. The acting was good, but the story was really dumb. How this made so much money is beyond me. It looked cheap & it was the same ol' shite over and over. The trailer showed all the good stuff. If you loved Blair Witch, then you'll probably like this too. I hated Witch. It showed the same crap over and over & was too long even though it was a short runtime. Skip this if you like good movies. This should have belonged on the Scifi channel if anything. The actors should have good careers ahead of them however. It seemed completely amateur too.",4,4,7,31 December 2009
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Wow, terrible and extremely boring!
","This was easily the worst of all the Harry Potter movies. I don't know if I should blame the embarrassingly slow screenplay, or the terrible direction. The only reason it even got a four is because the film looked good and the acting (Daniel Radcliffe excluded, he was terrible)was because just about all the other actors were good. I have never read a Harry Potter book and never will, but this either was adapted poorly or it really is the weakest of the books because it made the worst film by far. Right now this has an 8.1 rating here, and I believe it is because of all the fan-boys that give it a 10 don't really base the film on it's ACTUAL merits. I would not recommend this film to anyone less than 13 years old. I wouldn't even recommend this to people that are fans of the book because it can't be any worse than this. I always feel that movies, yes even sequels should have some sort of conclusion to them. There is absolutely no sort of conclusion to this film at all; it is 2 hours and 18 minutes of setting the viewers up for the inevitable fight between Harry and the Bad guy! That's it and that's all? If you were to take out all of the special effects, there would have been nothing to take out of this film. The director David Yates, I have never heard of and hope that I never do again. It amazes me that they would trust a multi-billion dollar enterprise with a basic unknown. I know it did really well Box office wise, but that is just because of the Harry Potter name alone. If this was the first of the Harry Potter films, we would have never seen another one. If you do see this film, just watch the last 30 minutes and you wouldn't have missed a thing.",4,0,1,16 July 2007
Life Is Beautiful," The most overrated Film of all time!
","I will never understand why this film and the star (Roberto Benigni) were/are so highly praised. This film is mediocre and plain pathetic at what it tried to do. I felt that it was only highly praised because everyone was sooo in love with Benigni and his ridiculous antics! I will never understand how this won any Oscars, or what exactly made this a great film. Now some of my favorite films are those that deal with WWII ('Downfall' for example) and the Holocaust. ('Schindlers List' stomps on this.) I appreciate what was trying to be said about the inhumanity of the Holocaust, and the fathers love for his son in keeping the truth from him. I just felt that it was very repetitive and didn't say or do anything that hasn't been said or done before in film. It is still rated in the Top 100 a decade later so there is obviously those that think this is still an excellent film. I would hope that people would watch it again and see if they still feel that this is really one of the best films of all time. I just can't see how this is rated in the Top 250 when there are so many other better films that are just out of it. Doesn't it make you wonder why we have never heard of this film really since? For that matter have we even heard of Roberto Benigni since? I feel that so many of these ratings are because everyone likes HIM so well, and are therefore biased on their ratings.",4,3,7,30 October 2007
The Red Violin," An Oscar winning Score, to be had by all that can appreciate such.
","I haven't seen this film in a few years, yet I often think of it. I recommend this beautiful film to anyone that likes a truly wonderful story. This is one of the least known movies that the great Samuel L. Jackson has done, and although his part is minor, he binds all the individual stories into one. Who knew a movie about only one constant (the violin) could be so touching/heart wrenching all in the same movie. I don't recommend this to everyone, but to those willing to think about the different cultures and how we all can be united by something as beautiful as music. Now I am not a huge fan of the violin sound particularly, (Yo Yo Ma notwithstanding, he's brilliant!) but I think anyone that has a basic understanding of musical instruments will realize and listen to the beautiful sounds that come out of this truly original piece of string family. Now if you like a lot of what is considered music these days, (Britney Spears for example) don't bother with this film because it will go right over your head. I would say when they get to some of the Oscar Winning original score, (It won in 2000) close your eyes to really listen to music. Now I'm a huge movie buff, and I am the last person to close my eyes during a movie, but when you watch this a 2nd, 3rd, 4th time, give it a try. Prepare for one of most amazing sounds ever to come out of this rarely heard of gem of a film.",8,0,0,29 August 2007
The Matrix Reloaded," Original tough to beat!
","This is a film that really needs a pre-requisite. If you were not a fan of the original 'Matrix' then you will undoubtedly not enjoy this film either. But if you are a fan of the whole 'Matrix' Universe, this film will grow on you after you watch it a couple more times. I know I was one of the people who was not particularly pleased with this film when I saw it opening day, especially with all the crap that the architect had to say. ( I don't consider myself dense, or a genius for that matter, but there was way too much info jammed into a little time period for most of us to grasp.) Granted I like big words as much as the next person who likes to think they are particularly intelligent, but unless you have an I.Q. of 130 plus or have done lots of research in the 'Matrix' world, you just won't get it. Don't get me wrong I love the whole idea of the 'Matrix' world and yes I love these two sequels (not as much as the original of course) But I think for the most part this film as well as 'Reveloutions don't need to be seen by the casual movie-goer. But... if you are a hardcore fan like me, (which means you have seen 'The Animatrix' and looked into it's meaning and background stories) This film as well as Reveloutions will grow on you the more you watch it. Is it just me or does it seem the whole 'Matrix' universe has so much more left in it to explore! I know some might think this is sacrilege, but I think this is the sort of Franchise that could have the legs of 'Star Wars.' I also predict that if the Wachowski brothers don't have too many more hits left in them, (or even if they do, who knows?) they will come back to what made them famous and help us and everyone who loves 'The Matrix' and explore it in a few more films, TV series possibly, and games. I know I look forward to it, and I would be willing to bet my life that we have not seen the last of 'The Matrix!'",8,0,1,14 January 2006
Enemy at the Gates," Epic fight sequences ruined w/pointless love story.
","This could have been a great film and it had a lot of potential...too bad it's ruined w/meddling love story. It's not that the acting is bad or the very absurd hardly true story of the famous Russian sniper. Yes the German's sent one of their best to kill him, but other than that there isn't much known. This could have been a good flick about Stalingrad, but that seems to be secondary to the completely forced love story/jealousy garbage which is a shame. Hopefully another good story about the truth of Stalingrad & the entire WWII battle on the Eastern Front because they don't need to invent anything to make any more interesting. The stories are there, they just need to be found.",6,1,5,10 April 2009
30 Days of Night," Great premise, spoiled with mediocrity.
","This film tried too hard to be too many things without settling with one or two good ones. I didn't love this flick but particularly hate it either. I loved the premise of 30 days of night straight. It was a shame that this film couldn't make up it's mind on what it wanted to be. At times it seemed to take itself very seriously and other times it seemed to cartoony in it's presentation. I thought a lot of the set pieces were excellent, most of the casting was pretty believable, (except for Josh Hartnett, not his fault, just the wrong man for the job) some of the camera work wasn't bad, but at other times it was plain sloppy. I personally am sick of the shaky-cam phase plaguing good (could be even better) movies these days. I understand that some people like the shaky-cam, but whenever I see it I think it's either because they are trying to hide something, or they don't know any other way to shoot the scene. I don't know if it's just me but I blame the overabundance of the shaky-cam epidemic on the overrated garbage 'Blair Witch Project.' I'm sure it was there before, but it seems to be around more and more, and it just won't go away. Now I don't always hate it, I just think it is used way too much. Can we tell them that it is going to be almost a decade since 'Blair Witch' came out. Let's get back to less shakiness and back to some good old fashioned camera shots. I also despised the way '30 days' ended, because for anyone that has seen 'Blade 2,' well you've seen it before, and better. I love Vampire movies, but I felt this great premise of a film was wasted with a terrible script and very little character development. I loved the overall look of the film and would recommend it as far as that is concerned, but for just a decent vampire movie well that is going to be in the eye of the beholder.",5,2,8,24 October 2007
There Will Be Blood," Brilliant if not a little overly long.
","I loved this movie except for a few very minuscule things. First of all Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is probably the most deserved Oscar that has been won by anyone from the past decade. (except maybe for Scorcese winning finally for best director last year for 'The Departed.') My only real complaint was that there were some scenes that were either too long or completely unnecessary. I went and saw this with my 16 year old cousin and he was not only not impressed he was very bored. I don't think I would have liked this having been that age 14 years ago either. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone that likes crappy movies like 'Fools Gold' or the god-awful movies that Martin Lawerence, Eddie Murphy and even the used to be funny Steve Martin movies those men are making now. So if you like movies that don't make you think...at all, or you have to have instant gratification with the movies you see, don't bother because you won't like it. However if you like a movie that has interesting characters, fantastic music, great cinematography, and an almost perfect screenplay then please rush to a theater to see this now! This isn't really one of those movies that you might want to see over and over but it is one of those you should at least see once. Besides the way the last 15-20 minutes plays out, sitting through the first 2 plus hours is worth all the wait.",9,1,5,3 March 2008
Downfall," Brilliant in it's entirety. Amazing film.
","I'm a huge history buff especially WWII & the German History of the Nazi's rise to power. I've read & studied about Hitler, Goebbels, Goering & especially Albert Speer, who was the only one to say he was 'sorry' @ the Nuremberg trials. His books that he wrote 'Inside the Third Reich & The Spandau Diaries' are fantastic questionably true portrayals about his life who was the closest thing to that Hitler had as a friend. This film for whatever reason didn't win the Oscar for best Foreign Language Film, but it should have. I have seen this probably a dozen or so times & know the History extremely well & yet this film still has tremendous power every time I see it. The actors are Superb especially Bruno Ganz in a eerily similar manner & look of Hitler. His performance is brilliant & he captures the manic that was within that truly was shown towards the inevitable end. Even if you aren't a fan of History (which is a shame, 'those that don't learn from history, are doomed to repeat it', great quote can't remember who said it) this is still a great film in of it self. It doesn't matter if you know the story or not because you will be fully engrossed once you start watching this superbly done film. I wouldn't have been able to appreciate this as much when I was younger *cough* teenager, like I can now, but if you miss out on this film It will be a shame. The fact that most of this film %%80-%90 percent of it is probably true too. This was extensively researched by those involved & the commentary by the director is extremely informative and interesting as well. By far one of the best commentaries I ever heard. He rarely stops talking (in a good way) & always has something interesting to say about the making of the film, the characters, & the basic true stories of those he profiles. A great film in every way which everyone should see. I'm a pretty tough critic so feel free to check my other comments to see where I stand. I don't give 10's very often maybe 1/500 films I see is a 10, so that is saying something, but don't take it from me, figure it out for yourself.",10,2,4,29 September 2008
The Reader," The performance of Winslet's career & she's not done yet.
","This is a film that is not for the young or for those looking for popcorn fare. This is for ADULTS & those interested in moral questions & justification to all sorts of unspeakable acts that we all are capable of doing. I can't express how good Kate Winslet is in her portrayal. In all of her Oscar nominations this is the best work. She is absolutely convincing playing this morally questionable character. Although she won the Oscar, the young man playing opposite her is excellent as well & it can't be said enough how good he is opposite Mrs. Mendes which is no small feat in itself. This is probably not for anyone younger than 21 & most definitely not for those looking for bubblegum light-hearted Hannah Montana let's just call it *Stuff* Anyone that is familiar & interested in the European theater of World War II are those who will be most interested. I would also say this is acting at it's absolute finest & nobody does it better than Kate Winslet. I'm betting Meryl Streep's 15 or 16 nominations will someday be overtaken by this beautiful superb woman. I'm hoping that we keep seeing this excellent actress for another 50 years to come because as long as people keep writing good work, she can do it.",10,2,4,12 March 2009
Hancock," Not enough re-shoots in the world could save this.
","They kept re-shooting and re-shooting this because of 'poor audience' reactions. I can tell you that they needed to have redone just about the whole picture. I like Will Smith, Charlize Theron, & the finally getting the roles & recognition he deserves Jason Bateman, but NOBODY could have saved this. I heard that this was one of the best scripts when it first was floating around town so it really makes you wonder what happened? This movie isn't the worst thing ever made, but it is one of the worst of the summer & is Will Smith's worst summer movie (even Men in Black II is better!) he's ever done. I have a strong suspicion that a lot of the problem w/this is because of studio tampering amongst other things. Right off the bat you know something is wrong when a Superhero flick is a scant 92 minutes (only about 1 hour twenty-something minutes when you take out the credits) and the whole 'explanation' is a cop-out. I am willing to bet this is going to be right on par with the 1st 'Hulk' when it tanks 65-70% it's second weekend. This is probably one of the dullest Superhero movies you will ever see & I very much doubt anyone that sees this will ever want to revisit it again either. If Will Smith makes this a hit (which he probably will) he can sell any movie. The acting is good, the special effects are passable, & the cinematography isn't bad, but other than that, skip this unless you thought Will Smith's 'Wild Wild West' was a classic. Peter Berg has yet to show us what he can really do with a big budget ('The Kingdom' doesn't count & 'Friday Night lights' was probably 1/5 this budget) & a good story. In a field crowded with Good Superhero movies, we don't have to swallow anymore of these if we stop going to see them. This movie will be a laughing matter as soon as 'The Dark Knight' comes out anyway.",4,4,10,4 July 2008
Hitch," Another formulaic Rom-Com.
","I must say before anything else that Will Smith is a true movie star. If this was made w/any other actor in his role, it would have done less than 1/10 of the business. This is another film that supposedly comes up w/a new idea yet when all is said and done it's just a rehash of a plain ol' romantic comedy. What this had going for it was all of the leads are good including Smith, Eva Mendes, Kevin James, & the highly underrated it's only a matter of time before she is a star Amber Valetta. This is a quite straightforward film w/no real surprises & nothing to take with you either. This is definition of fluff, nothing deep (not that it's supposed to be) you won't think about it, & will forget it as soon as you see it. I like Rom-Com's if they can offer something new or at least new-ISH. This is not it. I love ya Will, but here's hoping he will do something good again. 'I am Legend' weak, 'The Pursuit of Happiness' terribly overrated & worst of all as of late 'Hancock,' considering the obscene amount of money it made $624 million WORLDWIDE considering it's extremely bizarro 90 minute plot. This is another giant hit he's had over the past half dozen years, but none of them really have any substance. Here's hoping he doesn't play it safe much longer although you got to give him props for trying something different in the incomprehensible '7 Pounds.'",4,1,2,22 February 2009
WALL·E," It's now great & keeps getting better w/time.
","This is a very good movie but 10's across the board, c'mon now. 'Toy Story & Toy Story 2' smoke this. I'm sorry but this is just totally overrated just as 'Star Trek' is being rated right now. They are both good, but great films... no. Pixar has never made a bad film, ever and no other studio can come close to saying that. Granted they have only made 10 films ever but still that is amazing, not to mention they're huge Box office record. Maybe seeing this again someday will spark something in order for me to think it's a perfect film, but I doubt it. I can definitely see why think this is good, it's just not perfect. It shouldn't be in the top 250 that is for sure. Especially since it's above 'Toy Story' on the list and 'Toy Story 2' isn't even there at all. Well we shall see which films hold up better in the long run. It didn't help that they just had to stick an environmental message permeating throughout it too. It would be fine if it was a sub-plot not completely smacking you in the face over and over again. We get it we are becoming fat and becoming less and less personal w/each other, check got it, move on. Here's hoping that the new film 'UP' is better than this & in all likelihood it will be as the ad's alone are fantastically funny. No matter what I think of 'Wall-E,' Pixar is a legendary studio already which is amazing in it's own right considering it's 1st movie came out less than 16 years ago ('Toy Story') & it's Box office will surpass $5 billion worldwide not counting merchandising in only 11 films. *UPDATE* 9/16/09.Watched it again for the 2nd time (love the Streaming Netflix) & it is better the second time around. It is better than the 1st time I saw it. This is one of those movies that I will enjoy watching w/my kids if &/or when I have them. There is almost zero talking until about 25 minutes in, & it manages to tell an excellent story. The Pixar guys would have done just as well in the Silent movie era. It's brilliant complicated yet simple at the same time & it is in moved up in my head as one of the best Animated films ever made. I don't think anything could top 'The Lion King' w/the great script, voice cast, & one of the best most beautiful music ever done specifically for a movie.",9,0,1,23 May 2009
La Vie En Rose," A good movie, with a great performance.
","This is an excellent film. I honestly didn't know much about Edith Piaf at all as I'm not a fan of Opera. To me though the singing was just a mild part of made this a dizzying film. This was very good and would have rated higher in my book if they hadn't completely skipped the all important World War II. I don't know if it was for budgetary reasons, or if it just wasn't thought about or just plain skipped in the script. I don't remember all of the details of this but I still think about it every so often. I loved the performance of Marion Cotillard and I dearly hope she gets Oscar nominated, but I doubt it. If this was an American Film I don't see how she couldn't. Here's hoping. I would recommend this film for those that don't care for Opera (Me) and try expanding your mind to see an interesting life story of one of the worlds (and France's) most endearing singers.",8,2,6,13 January 2008
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Stick to the 1st film only. This is unnecessary & not so good.
","If Cate Blanchett hadn't come back for this film, there would have been no reason to see it. The original 'Elizabeth' is a wonderful film, and this film adds nothing to the mythos. I think Cate is a masterful actress and she is good in this too, but an Oscar nomination? Um no. I believe that just because a performance is outstanding it is much harder to justify it when the film it self isn't very good. Now don't get me wrong there is a lot of worse out there, however there really isn't much to get engaged in. I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone except the die hard fans of the first or of the Queen herself. I found myself to be pretty darn bored through just about everything. The cinematography is excellent, the acting is decent, and the sets are gorgeous. The problem is that the script just doesn't have that Umph you need to seriously get into it. I think 6/10 is generous and that is only because Blanchett is superb. Without her I would knock it down quite a bit.",6,0,0,5 February 2008
Slumdog Millionaire," What film did everyone else see?
","This is the most overrated film of the decade! Worse than that all the Oscars it won, the only one I can understand was best original song. I like Danny Boyle & am sure he has a great career ahead of him. He's already done some really enjoyable films including 'Millions' which is twice as good as this. I don't know how this won so many awards or what film they saw because this can't be it. It's full of clichés, the story is completely transparent with absolutely no surprises, & the script is middle of the road...at best! It will also help that you really like the show 'Who wants to be a Millionaire' because it's a large part of the story. If you don't like I don't, well it's even harder to get in on the story. On a plus note the acting was good especially the male lead Dev Patel & both of the little boys playing the young versions of Salim & Jamal are great. I can't figure out why this is any better than the other films nominated for Oscars, but this did not deserve Best Picture at all. I'm betting in 5-10 years this will be one of those films that people will wonder how this won all these awards. I'll wait for you all to catch up, but in all honesty stop doing/rating what everybody else is doing because it's the 'IN THING' & ignore the fact it won all the awards it won & rate the film on it's own. No bias no awards just how the film rates as it's own separate entity. It really is mediocre, not bad, but it's not good either but it definitely is not worthy of #42 of all time as it is ranked right now on IMDb. That puts it above 'Chinatown, The Departed & Forrest Gump?' (Just to name a few) What planet are you all from? I can understand 'Chinatown' because it's not for casual viewers, but above 'Forrest Gump?' There is absolutely no way & I would hope that people realize that they're giving this a higher rating than the much better 'Gump.'",6,4,6,8 March 2009
Goodfellas," A perfect film.
","This has everything a movie should have. A great story, acting, cinematography, direction, (I will never understand how Scorsese did not win his 1st Oscar!) production values, I can go on and on. There is nothing that isn't done perfectly on this film. If this were to come out in any given year it would be considered a classic. I understand that there are the hardcore devotee's to The 1st two Godfather films, but to me (and many others) this is the quintessential gangster film. I used to watch this film over and over and I usually try and nitpick even some of of the all time great films, but there is nothing I can pick on in this film! I had kind of seen Scorsese films before and really liked most of them, (Taxi Driver, & Raging Bull especially) but ever since 'Goodfellas' I would follow everything he did. I didn't follow the Oscars when I was a kid, but was shocked to learn this didn't win Best Picture however the fact that 'Dances with Wolves' did was one of the few times I wish the Oscar should could have been shared. As much as I loved 'Wolves' 'Goodfellas' has held up as the better picture. If you haven't seen this film and consider your self a serious film afectiando you need to see this before you are laughed at by actual filmphiles.",10,6,12,1 April 2008
The Proposal," Cliché' after Cliché' after, well you get the drift.
","I like the two leads but oh my this is weak. It's not that it's bad, it's just not good. It's one of those films that gave just about every single thing that is even remotely chuckle worthy (not funny because it's not funny) you saw in the trailer. I realize that everything has been done before at least once, but everything done in this has been done at least a HUNDRED TIMES & done better 99% of the times. There is almost Zero originality in this entire 2 extremely long & boring hours. Sandra Bullock & Ryan Reynolds did the absolute best they could w/this terrible script. If you have seen decent romantic comedies, skip this. How this made so much money is both sad & depressing because it means even more of these god-awful cliché ridden films. On the other hand it does make us appreciate good writers even more.",3,7,10,3 November 2009
The Simpsons Movie," 10 years too late, and the wait, not really worth it.
","An absolutely average movie. There isn't really a lot about this to say except it had few chuckles and many gags that just don't belong in a movie. Half of the gimmicks/jokes aren't barley even worth a regular episode on the show, let alone having to pay 10 bucks to see what was done better the first few years of the show. Overall I give it a little better than a 2 stars, but not worth more than that. For the die-hard fans (meaning those that still watch the show now) I'm sure they will love it. For those that stopped watching it 10 years ago, we'll just think it was a decent longer episode of the glory years of the show. For those that don't watch 'The Simpsons' at all, well they will chuckle a little bit, but they won't think much about it. All the good reviews are sort of hard to stomach, because the film really isn't that good on it's on merits. I won't say the film is bad, but c'mon now people it's not really that good either! Right now it's ranked here on IMDb as one of the TOP 250 ever. I am hoping that as people calm down after waiting 19 years to see this (A big reason why it's rating is so high) film, they will go back and see the film isn't really all that terrific. I will say that the marketing of this film is some of the best I have ever seen though.",6,2,6,4 August 2007
Atonement," The most overrated film of 2007, & oh yeah extremely boring too!
","Wow! I cannot understand for the life of me how this received 7 Oscar nominations! I don't know what movie they saw because I did not see the same one that is for sure. This movie was very very flawed in almost every regard. The only redeeming value was the acting was somewhat decent. The plot however was boring, the script jumped all over the place, and I had no emotional attachment to any of the characters. I could have cared less about what happened to anyone in this film. I can usually understand why certain films people like, even if I don't like them. Just as I despised 'American Beauty' because it's sick, but at least I can understand why others might like it. This however was extremely slow moving, the so-called love story was practically non-existent, and the over all feel of it was that of complete laziness. Don't bother to watch this unemotional snooze-fest.",4,1,3,25 March 2008
