Hereditary," SO BORING & AGAINST THE TRADE DESCRIPTIONS ACT. ASK FOR YOUR MONEY BACK!!!
","DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!What is supposed to be happening??? Like the last most scariest horror movie, 'Antichrist' (JOKE!!)It makes Rosemary's Baby look like the original 'IT'!!!Two hours of my life I won't get back!!!BORING!!!Toni Collette is one of my favourite actors ever so kept on watching out of respect for her.I feel she totally let herself down, taking this film on.She is so much better than this load of rubbish.Don't let yourself down next time, Toni.",1,1,5,23 August 2018
