Lucky Number Slevin," My Review
",Thought that this was okay...it goes through highs and lows of being really really engrossing and then into a bit of a lull. I may be slightly biased towards the duller side however I think that Josh Hartnet is an appalling actor and he spoilers every movie that he's in. I'm also not keen on Lucy Lu so this probably isn't the best movie choice for me anyhow.In saying that Bruce Willis manages to get both the crap actors through this movie and it keeps you watching even if it is a tad predictable...I'm not someone who saw the Sixth Sense twist coming but believe me I saw this one in the making after the first 25 mins. Don't get me wrong though this is a decent enough movie and is definitely worth watching at least once.,6,1,5,5 July 2006
