The Lobster," A Love Story
","Before seeing this I heard several descriptions of it, to the effect that it's a movie about a hotel where single people go and if they don't hook up they are turned into animals. That's the first 40 minutes, but it's not what the movie is 'about,' It's a love story. And it's full of strange allegories about relationships that - to me - are really little and larger vignettes about relationship status' and existential angst, and a sort of cynical social commentary about anthropology and societal judgement. In some ways you can enter this movie as though you're about to watch a series of skits about 'coupling' and it will work pretty fine. I thought the ending made a lot of sense along the above lines. What connects two people really isn't the point. The point is that they are - and remain - connected.",8,0,3,21 June 2016
Lucky Number Slevin," plenty of eye candy in this one!
","I liked it. I didn't think it was trying to be overly cool, and the dialog was amusing. I mean, I go to movies just to be entertained so it worked for me.The best part of this film was the characters. I forgot Ben Kingsley was Ben Kingsley, and even Morgan Freeman, who is such an engaging person in himself always exuding integrity, goes beyond that and conveys a kind of weakness or hypocrisy which really made it feel like a different character for him. Bruce Willis was phenomenally elegant, and Josh Harnett - well, he doesn't really need to do much to be very amusing but I liked his delivery even though some called it smug.People are ripping this movie a new one because it emulates other films, but the thing that carried it for me was the acting and the characterizations. I agree with another poster who said the first 20 minutes are amazing. Definitely a very strong rental with fun twists. Very violent though.",7,1,8,8 May 2006
Marie Antoinette," A Very American Movie
","Good soundtrack, good eye candy.This film would have benefited - greatly - from scripted dialog and more editing. It was obvious the director was driving at creating an atmosphere of a naive teenaged European monarchy and its trappings. But it was heavy handed to the point of ponderous in that regard. The casual language and rocky improvisation by the main characters came off more sloppy or 'in your face cool' than anything, in my opinion. I am not surprised it was booed in Cannes, since it's patently American.That said, it was generally fun to watch and marie antoinette's story was credible.",6,1,2,28 October 2006
The Adjustment Bureau," Crappy trailer
","I really liked this movie, but I can't believe how disparate the tone of the trailer is vs the tone of this movie. The people who approved the trailer should be canned, because in my opinion the trailer will lose audiences who might normally like this film. The trailer makes it seem like this is a hyper suspenseful and violent action thriller, which couldn't be further from what it is - an entertaining puzzler. I wouldn't give it a 10, but it was genuinely entertaining with some fresh and interesting faces. Why everything seems to need to be sold like and action thriller these days is confusing to me. I'm sure they test market a lot of these things, but the trailer totally missed the point and I wouldn't have gone to see it had my friend really wanted to go and had I just noticed a decent review.",1,12,25,5 March 2011
Casino Royale," He's a Cop
","I enjoyed watching Daniel Craig as James Bond. He has a simian quality the others haven't, except perhaps Connery a bit. When he sat down at the poker table with the other international high-rollers, in comparison to them he just screamed 'cop.' The short hair, the buff almost military appearance, ape like bearing. This Bond has some privilege but he doesn't have to cover up with the airs of a gentleman. His manners are dictated by common sense more than breeding or a concern for appearances. I also like his almost robotic nature when he's behind the scenes doing his job, crashing the cars, sneaking into the hotel's security office, always 5 steps ahead of us. Sometimes Craig seems a little over-botoxed with the lack of facial expressions, but his fanny did look really cute in those blue linen pants.",8,2,4,3 December 2006
