Sucker Punch," I believe the only movie I ever gave a 10 to...
","By now everyone interested in seeing this movie probably has seen it, or has at least read about it.I will say. I do not know why anyone would read about the movie, understand how it is done, then complain about how it is done. May not be a 10 for everyone. But if you don't like it, then I don't know why you chose to watch it. It isn't as if you were caught by surprise by what the move offers.That would be the equivalent of: Reading how a train can never leave it's tracks. Then complaining that you wish the train could drive through town.Amazing movie.",10,16,30,3 July 2011
The Notebook," A Moving Tell
","I was pretty reluctant to watch this movie, as I had heard so many comments on it. Most of them good. Some of them bad. Other than that though I purposely did not read to much about the movie except for what was listed on the back cover. After finally picking it up, all I can say is do not let other's opinions make the choice for you. Good or bad comments often ruin a movie experience for me.If you are like me at all in that respect, I urge you to just watch the movie. It isn't unpredictable. It isn't tragic, or happy. It seems a bit unreal, and hard to believe in today's world, where promises mean so little. This movie embraces what love is all about. Some macho people may call it it a chicflic, but to me that is just being afraid of the stigma of showing emotion. Where would human kind be without love? It seems movies like Troy, and Lion Heart are OK because men are killing other men, and fighting for love. But a movie that shows another side, of living a normal life and still fighting for love is somehow anathema is ridiculous.Just watch the movie.",9,0,0,2 July 2005
