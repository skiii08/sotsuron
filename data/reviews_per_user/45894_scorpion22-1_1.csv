The Equalizer," Rambo in a DIY
","Huge disappointment. Enter the Cold war II!A single 60-years old guy destroys the most severe Russian gang in a local DIY with screws and hammers. The first 10 minutes were OK, but after that it turned into a cheap action without any logical plot. The final was crushing - Denzel goes to Moscow and kills the bad guy in his bathroom, preliminary liquidating his army of bodyguards. The message - Russians, don't mess with us or we shall send you our deadliest weapon - DIY supervisor. We have a new sheriff in town - killing the bad, protecting the poor Latin minority, punishing the corrupted cops... Hollywood best days were over long time ago. RIP! I haven't watched such ridiculous propaganda since Rambo. 2 hours wasted time and bad taste in the mouth.",1,141,290,3 October 2014
