Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Don't take your guns to town...
","An highly entertaining piece of cinema. Borrowing from every great action movie of note in the past four decades this film delivers from front to back leaving just enough unsaid to truly give the characters enough mystery for some great mythology. Remember how you thought Bobba Fett was the coolest? That's because you didn't really know jack about him...If volume one was about action, volume two is about suspense and muted emotion. Drawing the audience in with gritty exchanges and gruesome action the movie takes a different kind of turn when Bill and the Bride finally come face to face.Great film with an interesting but dangerous nearing flat ending. The plot is running on the rim when it finally screeches to a halt with a satisfying spin out. An oddly delicate if uneven ending that recalls the final piano note from the Beatles 'Day in the life' in that after a crescendo of mayhem your left with an open ended story and moral questions left unanswered.This film will be even better if it is ever cut together and viewed as one entire piece. I felt that cutting this movie in half was a bad (and greedy) Harvey Wienstein idea and really creates something lopsided. However despite the slashing, it is an epic without a doubt and will stand up to the sands of time. It could take it's place in the pantheon of great even near perfect action films. 9.5/10",10,1,2,16 April 2004
Requiem for a Dream," Elegantly Vulgar
","Aronofsky delivers a murky dream world set in a pitiless city (New York) focusing on hopeless situations, missed connections and the trappings of being socially disconnected from loved ones. What hits hardest in this film is the simple point missed by so many people I've talked to about this movie. The film's main message wasn't in my opinion about destructive drug behavior (that seems more like a frame or device) so much as a sad tale about the inability to relate and communicate with loved ones. Turning away from what could provide support into a family-like world of drug friends and drug fiends Leto's character continues his travels in what is alluded to in the movie having already been a long history of drug abuse and problems.
I got the feeling that all of the characters had no idea what they wanted to do with their lives so they passed the time with drugs and schemes of a better life, no matter how low-life the goals seemed. At first everything is going great, ah, but the best laid plans of mice and men shall go astray as they do. this makes the story pop to life. I've known people like this in life, maybe not to this dark degree but it was an interesting allegory about modern malaise and quick fix American life. Straight arrow characters in white suits hardly make for an interesting story so down a crooked path the film travels. The film is hard to take at times and is not for everyone. I do find it troubling the amount of fetishistic worship put into this film. I suppose that in itself is noir commentary on parts of our culture.Stark cinematography, excellent actor performances and pitch black tone this film frames a world of pain and suffering for the characters. The films climax is very brutal and for some it might be hard to watch. Despite what some think about the ending being hopeless, I disagree. I felt that there was a small ray of light shining into Harry's mind that maybe a reconnection with his family was possible, however it was more likely given the history of the character that only more pain was in store. When you speculate about the future of a characters after the conclusion of the film, that's when you know the director has created a great story.Sharp and nihilistic cinema. 9/10",9,0,1,27 April 2004
United 93," Chaos and Disorder
","Well, this movie in my mind accurately captured the chaos of that day all the way to the end of the film.The hijackers were all played with a high level of humanity and I was glad for that. I had always pictured in my mind that these guys were scared out of their minds just like the passengers. I have to believe that nobody is totally cold blooded when they are on a suicide mission. Nobody sane enough to try something requiring so much thought out coordination would have that kind of resolve.At one point you feel like the leader is about to abort the mission until a younger, antsy terrorist forces his hand. I've read people influenced by jihad almost act like they are affected by drugs, addicted to the violence of jihad, that was captured in one of the characters.It overall was a great film and was handled with class. I know it sounds silly but you really felt like you were there, even though we have no way of knowing what happened. And above all, it took me back to that day more than any newscast; article or clip has done since then.",7,0,0,30 September 2006
Friday Night Lights," A mosaic of human flaws and perfection.
","This is a film that strives to be 'perfect'.This is a mosaic of human vignettes and stories woven into a tale of a team in turn shown as a metaphor for life. OK, well actually, this drama was about a West Texas high school football team in the late 80's but something about it rings so true to so many walks of life you can't help but see deeper meaning in it's messages. It's about a striving, pressure, the lonely nature of responsibility, hardships, overcoming challenges in life, greater goals and the power found in life philosophy put to use.Top flight acting is abound with the usual quality Thornton provides playing a subdued Coach Gary Gaines with a quite dignity, but the real standouts come in the form of Lucas Black and Derek Luke in their roles respectively as QB and HB. One with stoic fearful dignity and another with flawed talented swagger, you really start to make connection on many different levels with the characters. This film could be a star making role for either of these young men.Obviously after seeing this movie I would say, the production values are very high with excellent editing, cinematography and writing. You can almost taste the dusty roads and feel the dirty town of Odessa under your fingernails when the film is over. A certain amount of sadness and dignity surrounds the players where pressure above all has drained any kind of enjoyment from the game. The town is the protagonist, drawing the life out of its high school team in a vampiric nature feeding on the Panthers paths to glory. It can be at times depressing. Odessa, is told in the film to be a place to escape or be forever trapped in the browning pages of ancient history, seeking that fall season fix of football dominance. The film keeps a tight storyline by focusing on only a few key players but does have an expansive feel, epic in nature.The film does not capture the depth of the book, the race issues, the academic logistics and the overall mania of MOJO, however that would be impossible without making this into a television series or at least a much deeper storyline. Not without trying though, it does take its swipes and endeavors to stay close with the source material for most of the film. The film definitely however avoids most sports cliché, but it truly is impossible to have a prolific sports film without a bit of cliché' just due to the repetitive nature of sports in general and the vast number of sports films available. It has been noted that a large amount of artistic license was taken with the Billingsly family, score of the final game, relationships, glossing over the racist nature of the town, the Carter negotiations and game and changing the final play to give it more overall cinematic impact. Hey, I'm fine with that, that's why the opening scene says 'BASED on a true story'. You have to get people in the door to tell your story. FNL tells a beautiful one. The movie ends with a grace that is oddly satisfying without being Hollywood, something tough to find in a sports film.This movie succeeds where so many other films like this have failed by giving you a human bond with the characters. While it sounds entirely cliché, this movie had some very deep and inspirational moments not just for football but for life in general, I recommend it to anyone, I would add however you would be better served by the book, but I'm being realistic here! A highly underrated film, this is a piece that could be watched by a family, sports fan but above all anyone that enjoys well crafted film. 10/10",10,2,5,1 November 2004
Monster," Hardboiled with a perverted feminist streak...
","Oh I love when a film champions dirtbags, giving you every reason why you should feel sorry, feel sad for them. To this films credit it was nuanced and had a couple different interesting levels to it. It was like a car wreck of a life that you couldn't help but stare at, even more so when you think that it was a true story and the plotting and dialog was mostly realistic. Christina Ricci does a serviceable job and Theron wins the Oscar but I had a really hard time finding anything else good about this film other than the acting. It was more of a rotten look at the underbelly of white trash America than anything else.I still have a hard time recommending this as entertainment or even as a message film. Hardboiled and shocking with a perverted feminist theme, this film didn't do much for me. Depressing waste of time.",Null,1,6,25 October 2004
The Bourne Identity," Loved the apples & this movie.
","Goodwill Hunting 2: Hunting Season Ever wonder what would have happened to Will Hunting had he taken that job with the CIA? He would have been turned into the ultimate spy weapon! Matt Damon has really made a niche for himself playing talented genius liars. All the suspense of the Talented Mr. Ripley with 20% less of the homosexual overtones.In all seriousness, this was an entertaining film with wit and solid action. I largely ignored this film for a great deal of time and only watched it after a friend's recommendation on DVD. I'm glad I took the time. This film has great European settings, intelligent pacing, tightly filmed solutions to what seems to be an endless amount of escapes that Jason Bourne needs to makes. The character due to his memory loss has an interesting fourth dimension in his personality than your run of the mill Bond knock-off super-spy. Franka Potente is an odd (but beautiful) fit into the role of Marie in character motivations that laugh in the face of logical thinking. She makes it work, nice save Franka. Chris Cooper is a shallow underdeveloped yet oddly hateable movie villain. While this movie is a B+ list actor's blue heaven, extremely confusing to me was the reasoning behind casting Julia Styles...  Can't win them all!Tons of questions were left open at the end of the film, I suppose under the assumption that a sequel would be made. (The Bourne Supremacy) Too much or maybe oddly not enough time was spent developing 1. The motives of the CIA's immediate need to kill him 2. The only real problem I have with this film is the extremely implausible awkward relationship between Bourne and Marie. I'm going to just let the small stuff go and enjoy the film, if you worry too much about why he doesn't at least put a hat on or ditch the red bag, grow up.Yeah, time is short so they just cut right to the chase, literally. Hey, that's fine with me, the film works on many levels, plenty of 'Oh hell no!' moments, it made me want to read the book for the details and it definitely made me interested in the sequel. If it's as good as this film, I'd say a wonderful franchise has been Bourne.",9,0,1,6 May 2004
American Beauty," Fiddle in the Middle (Class)
","The beauty of Lester Burnham's story is that it's so relatable. In fact, so many of the characters in this film are written with realism, that it's easy to slip into this world, a dark mirror of American suburban life.
This is the story of Lester Burnham, he's a mid-western, middle age, middle management, middle class family man with a midlife crisis on his hand. That's the hook, the story could be something to everyone. The story of Lester Burnham is the story most males face in nearly every walk of life to varying degrees. Lester is beat down by life, more specifically in a way, by the women in his life and his lack of being true to his desires. Chasing after the 'American' dream has become more than tiresome to Lester, it's become a prison. He seeks some fantasy world where he can drift around in a male utopia, this it shouldn't be written off as shallow. In this society certain things are expected of men on a daily basis that tend to cause contradictions in character and in life. This film is a sharp examination of men, family, success and your own life's direction. It's also about settling for less than.What could have just as easily been a 'dull talkie' on the subject of bourgeois is transformed by the quality of direction, intelligence of the dialog, the film technique used and again very relatable subject matter. The cast does a very reliable job but there are a few moments and thick pieces of ham that degrade and slow things down. A few of the supporting actors appear to be hogging scenes. As sharp as the critique on the male 'failure' is the savage critique on the female 'success'. Basically this movie comes down to, what do people want from life or more what do people NOT do to get it. There are a vast number of layers and messages in this film. Studied, anyone could find more than a few that relate personally because of the simple fact of how honest the film is. The film revolves around re-evaluation of situation. How no matter how comfortable you are, your life moves one minute at a time and is forever changing.",10,0,1,4 May 2004
Collateral," Flawless and Taught
","Michael Mann (HEAT & THE INSIDER) creates a film with the ultimate LA at night feel, interweaving streets, lights, common everyday mundane activities to build a near perfect suspense thriller with little or no gaps or flaws. Perfectly believable as a crime flick and even better as a character study this film entertains in many different ways. Worth a look or two.Tom Cruise (TOP GUN) is pitch perfect as an over the top assassin but the real spotlight shines on Jamie Foxx (ANY GIVEN Sunday) who not only steals the movie but carves deeper the notch in his acting belt showing his talent as a believable everyday guy. While a lot of the film is emotionally driven and the action in this film is limited but rapid fire and brutal, I really enjoyed the pacing and never once felt a moment when the movie slowed or stalled out. It had perpetual motion until the last moments. Both actors make you care about their respective characters and keep an interesting climax or some would say anti-climax.Directed as beautifully as it is acted this movie is 2004's sleeper and should not be missed. 9/10",10,0,1,6 September 2004
Alien vs. Predator," Try filming a decent movie to go with the marketing...
","This movie is the perfect epitome of Hollywood taking something beloved, running it straight to hell (Predator 2, Alien 4) and then taking it even one step further by completely disjointing the stories and continuity, *ahem* alienating the fans and basically wasting everyone's time while marring the original (Caddyshack 2 anyone??) all in the name of the mighty dollar bill. Seeing this movie only eggs them on people! This is a movie that you immediately wish you could UNWATCH and erase from your memory banks.I would be highly surprised if more time went into the script of this film than the actual marketing. I'm not even going to complain about the PG-13 rating because it is what it is.... just a bad movie.Horrible acting. Pointless plodding sub-plots. Decent action sequences and a precious few cool moments in what should have been a fan-boy's wet dream. The lead in this movie is a demographic friendly woman with barely enough acting ability to make a shampoo ad believable. Any mildly entertaining characters were immediately destroyed in the first twenty minutes of the film with zero payout. Even the marquee monsters end up looking bored as the audience is lead along in a by numbers popcorn sales ploy.",2,182,363,17 August 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Art Theft by the master thief
","A bloody revenge film with great dialog, excellent film technique and perfect pacing. The film never has a chance to bog down and instead accelerates into... fun.Charmingly evil anti-heros do battle. Nothing really original about that but amazingly entertaining. If Pulp Fiction inspired everyone with the ability to write some cheap dime-store dialog to put out a 'film' riffing on unoriginal ideas, then this movie is the ultimate jazz jam of grindhouse technique. Tarantino movies are more or less pitch perfect remixes of genres. And you know what? That's better than ok. It's a tune you can hum along with. Original in principal? no. Entertaining. YES! The tons of unanswered questions are half the fun.If you like fast paced action, skewed plotting, stark images, crafty editing and interesting exchanges between characters this film is for you. Deftly melting down a genre and forging an entertaining masterpiece. A great film that WILL stand the test of time. Pretty good for a film that you've only seen half of. 9/10Oh yeah and don't forget.... 'Self-plagiarism is style.' - Alfred Hitchcock",10,0,1,15 April 2004
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," dark musical comedy about love and hope
","The story of a talented rock-star shunned due to the unfortunate status of gender politics of the age. Hedwig's lover co-ops his music and becomes a huge teen-heartbeat star removing all meaning and quality from the music and makes it socially and mainstream consumable, discarding Hedwig left to meander in the underworld of broken dreams. Think Elvis, if he had heisted his gig from a glam star...An odd mix of theater drama, dark tragedy and sharp political gender comedy, this film easily entertains the open minded and interests even the closed minded. Some parts are a bit over the top but it retains a freewheeling vibe that doesn't allow the sad facts of Hedwig's life to bog it down. Certain scenes of the film seem like unneeded filler and even at times are bordering on agitating but they combine to give more depth to the character as a whole which in turn allows you to care about what happens next in the story and life of Hedwig. It respectfully (and thankfully) avoids gay cliche' and stereotypes with an intelligent story while retaining the wild and very human charisma that makes it engaging. Steven Trask's score is beyond stellar and even if you can't get into the subject matter of movie, the soundtrack would still be recommended as a solid rock opera piece. The story COULD have easily been used as a bridge device to different musical numbers, however it avoids that horrid musical cliché' with good acting, engaging dialog and bright but sparse directing, making this a great dark comedy. I cannot remember the last time I saw a musical that ran the length of emotion that this one did. Dark comedy, sad introspection, longing, lust and most importantly love.Hedwig and the Angry Inch is successful in being a great dark comedy about love and hope as well as being a great musical achievement. 9/10",9,0,1,26 April 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Pictures of You
","'Eternal Sunshine' is a complicated story that demands your full attention; Mr. Gondry unfolds it at a mind-bending pace. This alone makes it a hugely refreshing respite from ordinary multiplex fare.The perceived message in the movie was you can't run from your problems, failures, inadequacies. It was also exploration of memory and it's qualities to shape your personality and reactions to relationships. The movie's dialog keeps things real with sharp exchanges and interesting small details.Contrary to what people say about it being hard to follow, I found the editing on a story that COULD have been truly mind bending, to be pleasantly cohesive. If you paid any amount of attention to the film, you would easily and completely understand it.Similar to Vanilla Sky or Punch Drunk Love, it made me kind of hopefully sad. Also in similarity people left during the middle of the movie when they weren't laughing enough. Mass market movie? Not quite yet.The knowledge that with relationships the very good comes with the very bad and vice versa. However, it was very subtle and deft in conveying the message subliminally. Personally, I can't stand when a movie beats you senseless with it's ill fitting one size fits all 'message'.The movie to me was like a great photograph that let's you find the meaning in relation to your own life. A Rorschach test of sorts. If a person can find a way to identify with the situations and ignore the vast number of gaps in the 'science' of the premise they could find their own meaning in it.Reading other user comments cements in my mind that 90% of reviewers don't have a clue about what they are writing here. Another 5% want to complain about a trivial portion of the movie be it style, a plot hole (in a sci-fi movie no less) or the simple fact that they don't particularly care for an actor. This makes surfing for 5% real fairminded reviews a challenge. A great story rips away any preconceived thoughts the actor outside of the films parameters. It's called suspension of disbelief and a few people should lighten up and learn about it or stop watching anything but documentary films. Regarding the use of style techniques in this film, I think that if you have such a major problem with motion sickness during a film, you should get to the film on time so you don't have to sit in the front row, bring motion sickness medicine or just stay at home and not see movies in a theater. I would prefer you do the later.",10,0,1,15 April 2004
Saw," Wasted potential - Horrible acting
","This movie had such promise, with an interesting trailer (which if you've seen you've pretty much seen the entire film) and an interesting premise they easily squander all of this with poor acting, worse editing and just an overall unpolished film experience. If you're reading this review, you've probably already read the premise so let's move right to the good and bad of this film. Bad - First, the casting of Carry Elwes was the first strike against this movie, his overacting is not only hammy, it's just plain laughable. Need proof? See this film in a theater and check out how many people laugh at parts that are neither funny or meant to be scary. Danny Glover's character is decent but completely out of place. He disjoints the film but does add a bit of excitement into the climax. The pacing of the film felt entirely disjointed, you weren't sure the order of real time events and some of the plot seemed a bit ignorant. This film was not as smart as it thought it was. Comparisons to Se7en really should not have been made because it doesn't really even approach the level of intensity Se7en does. It's truly hard to care for ANY of these characters so I suppose in a way, the killer is the anti-hero of the film.Good - Overall look of the film was gritty and honestly, the climax was predictable and unsatisfying but very tense. This is one of those 'don't ruin the ending' films. But unfortunately they take a decent one shot script and decide to make a franchise out of it. How Hollywood. Overall this film is worth a single watch for horror fans and maybe even some discussion after but not much else. 6/10",Null,0,0,1 November 2004
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Big stupid fun.
","A sincerely funny movie. Lot's of great lines sure to be quoted from now until the end of history. Similar to the cult status Caddyshack has obtained. Sure for better or worse to be absorbed into lowbrow culture. Don't let that discourage you, this movie is quite funny and surprisingly warm hearted. Bobbing along with a happy-go-lucky feel allowing you to relax and laugh at the cast proceeds to unfurl a relentlessly long line of sight gags and one liners.Will Ferrell going big on every joke misses with a few but for the most part the supporting cast picks up all of the slack most notably Steven Carell. I saw this film in Chicago in a preview and went in expecting zilch and even almost left before it started due to the annoying frat-like crowd but I left thinking I had just viewed one of the most funny films in years. Big, loud, stupid and amazingly fun. This one should definitely go on the shelf with the great comedies of our time.",Null,1,1,15 July 2004
300," Worth watching but poor acting and directing foil what could have been a classic war movie
","Clearly, this film is not for everyone. The film looks utterly fantastic, but the reality is, this is a failed attempt at a breakthrough film. The battle scenes are magnificent; in fact I can't remember seeing a more interesting film about ancient war. Now before the fan boys pile on, ask yourself honestly about the poor acting, horrible directing and quite possibility the worst voice over ever heard in a movie and why it really put a damper on the party for some. I know people will disagree and say that it was supposed to be over the top and that is fine, but I think even less dialogue would have improved this film. Everything was drilled home in 50 point block letters and subtlety was completely abandoned. People in the Imax I saw this film with were eating up the endless catchphrases. Well, that's showbiz... I guess.As a comic book movie, this was mission accomplished. Great villains, amazing action sequences that stylistically were like a dance and really, really bloody battles make this an action film for fans of the genre. And these elements reach right in and pull this movie out of the fire. And while I was not bothered by the no-name cast, the direction of these actors was bordering on criminal behavior. The over use of slow motion and not mixing up the technique really marred the overall product that was provided to the viewer. It really started to seem like a music video. Don't get me wrong, there were some amazing movie moments in this film, but the eye rolling at the ham fisted words really detracted from the movie as an overall piece of art it could have been. If Zack Snyder is really going to direct Alan Moore's the Watchmen, he needs to go and look up the words subtle and substance before he utters 'action' even the first time during filming.Much has been said about if Synder was trying to slip a conservative message into the film and a lot of things could be read or misread from this. Believe me, he wasn't that smooth. In my opinion it was a not so subtle way of portraying the hawk-like nature of the Spartan culture is ultimately what was being conveyed and not a slipped jab to eastern Asian culture as some have implied. But take what you will from the 'they ask you to stand and I ask you kneel' remarks of Xerxes. That is the rhetoric of rulers and warriors and it's not always pretty. A lot of items in this film can have modern day parallels drawn. But ultimately it is just a movie. Relax. Followers of Islam should relax, Islam didn't even exist during this time.I guess for me personally, the worst part about this film is how much potential was wasted. This is an amazing legend that could have really been translated into something we would remember for a long time, had some actor directing skill and improved dialogue, this could have been a masterpiece. I love and hate this film at the same time.",7,2,9,16 March 2007
