Frost_Nixon," Slow burn... But...
","I've sat through the 2 hour film, and it took me a while to get into it. I thought at the beginning, with the back story being so detailed in its approach to the character and David's transient life style that it would be a master piece of interviewing against the former president Nixon. But it was obvious that David didn't take the task of this monumental interview seriously, a fact lacking in the overall footnote in the history of the interview. Ron Howard did a sterling job, a lot of familiar faces, even in parts that probably adorned the editing suite floor, but familiar and comforting in its gravitas.Great parts, Michael Sheen doing a fantastic job of the accent throughout, and Sam Rockwell was brilliant as the researcher James Reston Jr, I was even surprised at Matthew Macfadyen's performance (blonde wig aside), as it showed some depth lacking in his previous performances in the UK's TV show Spooks.Overall its a historical view of an interview few will be interested in, but as a fan of David Frost, and those studying the Nixon years will find enjoyable in its slow pace, great direction and one that only historically minded people will relish. Outstanding acting throughout.",8,2,5,11 January 2009
