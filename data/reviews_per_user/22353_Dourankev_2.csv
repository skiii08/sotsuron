Child 44," American film about life in the USSR. Full of stereotypes!
","Imagine: Russian film about life in the United States. Nonsense. Also: American film about life in the USSR. Full of stereotypes (American Made). Very weak film with a mediocre script and predictable action. Cartoons have better scenarios. Imum feeling that the writer did not go to Russia, except during sleep. Game of the actors is not inspiring. Frequent images of Russians with beards - anomaly under Stalin. Stalin himself is presented as a demon who gives instructions for everything and mystify. Political correctness mass consciousness here is at least second to none - everything in Russia was worse. Even more amazing is that the length of the film is stretched and lose more than two hours. It is pointless to spend money to watch this film. 1 out of 10.",1,4,13,26 September 2015
Cloud Atlas," The film was not nominated for an Oscar
","The film is wonderful, one of the best for 2012. The film was not nominated for an Oscar, which is proof of the value of the Oscars. In the minds of viewers, however, the film earned more than 'Argo'! Great script, great direction, fantastic actors play! Synthesis of the best of world cinema! This is a film that will be seen many times, not just once. And not just in the U.S. but in Europe and in the world. Film classics. In a word - masterpiece. It may not be the 100 greatest movies of all time, but one of the 100 films of the XXI century. With one punch he ever sends thousands of other movies, ephemera. The film should not go unnoticed, advocate and analyze its dignity. Rating: 10 out of 10.",10,10,18,17 March 2013
