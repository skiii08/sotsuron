Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A good night at the movies.
","I still don't understand the negative press and comments that go with this film. I'm not a hard-core fan like some. I do have a life away from the computer and TV screen. However I do love movies and I do love Star Wars. They still remain my favourites and it is always good to revisit them from time to time. It's like popping in to see an old friend. They still look the same. Age might have wearied them a little but it's still good to see them.The hype surrounding The Phantom Menace was high and maybe that was off-putting to some. However, I think people were expecting the same feelings they had when Star Wars first came out in 1977.( and yes I will call it Star Wars and not A New Hope because that's what I grew up calling it and always will.)We had twenty two years of imitations and thoughtless eye candy in between the original and Menace. No matter what George Lucas did he was going to be nailed to the wall for it. Personally I thought he did a great job. He always said the tone of the first film would be light considering he was telling the story of a young boy. He said the second would be darker and the third the darkest of all. He stuck to his guns about all three and good on him.I find it amusing that people will analyze the hell out these films. They will nitpick about the smallest details when they should realise that it is just a film. It is fun and it is a good night at the movies. Don't these people have a life. There is more to the world than a TV screen. Get out of your dark rooms and go meet some flesh and blood people. In other words get a life.The Phantom Menace is great. I like it. But then everyone is entitled to their own opinion.",10,0,1,13 May 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Best of the trilogy.
","Let me get one thing out of the way before I start. I will probably be bashed by Tolkien enthusiasts for it but who cares.I have tried to read the Lord of the Rings on several occasions, mainly because everyone says it is so great and I want to believe them, but I find this book so ludicrously boring that I can only get through half of Fellowship before my mind is wandering on to other things like wondering if I put the cat out. It is pretentious and written in that smug stiff-upper lip way that just makes me want to throw the book across the room. It has way too much description and doesn't allow the reader to project their own images about what's going on. It bogs the story down too.Having said that I was still looking forward to seeing the films that Peter Jackson was making. I am on record as saying that they would be the biggest films of all time and would ultimately win the coveted Oscar. There was no basis for this as Jackson didn't exactly have a big budget Oscar-winning background. But he is a Kiwi as I am and knew he could pull it off in the best number-eight wire tradition.The Fellowship of the Ring remains my favourite simply because it concentrates more on the characters than on big budget battle scenes. Don't get me wrong. I loved 2 and 3 as well but Fellowship just edges out. Maybe because it was the first and surprised the hell out of me by having a good story and great film-making tools to tell that story.Everyone says the extended versions are the definitive ones but I still like to go back every now and then and watch the theatrical versions just to remind me of that experience I felt in the cinema. Something I hadn't felt since Star Wars.All in all a great movie going experience. Onya Peter Jackson.",10,1,3,12 May 2005
The Exorcist," Truly scary
",First I'll start by saying that while The Exorcist is the scariest horror movie ever made it is not the best in my opinion. I rank The Omen and A Nightmare on Elm Street higher. Both movies are fun to watch but neither are scary. ( Well maybe The Omen a little. ) The Exorcist is the only movie ever to disturb me. I watch it these days and I find nothing perturbing about it. However I'm a little more cynical these days than in the early eighties when I first saw it. I was only about fifteen or sixteen when my mother brought the video home not knowing what it was about. The tape was turned off immediately when it came to the crucifix scene. I never saw the rest of the film until 1990 London when it was shown in a theatre on Shaftsbury Avenue. I was glad to revisit it in all it's glory. Having become a non-believer in that space of time I could watch the film for what it was. A very good night's entertainment. One thing struck me though a few years later when I bought the 25th anniversary edition. It's not the gore and spectacle that scare you or remain with you when you leave the theatre. It's the little things. When the clock stops at the start of the film. The rustling noise in the attic. The subliminal flash of a white face. Whenever Reagan says something about Captain Howdy. It still sends shivers up my spine. The blood and the gore don't interest me. It leaves nothing to the imagination. The Exorcist works brilliantly as a psychological thriller and I think that's where the scares come from. I love this film and revisit it every now and then just to get those goosebumps rising.A very good shocker and no horror movie has scared me since. A testament to it's genius.,10,0,1,14 May 2005
Cars," One of the best
","Computer animation has had it's ups and downs since Toy Story but I have to say that even though I am thirty seven years old I am still a kid at heart. Even the least of the animation films (Shark Tale) over the last decade have still been of reasonable quality. People who say that movies these days are all about the effects and have no heart need to go out and rent some DVD's.The cream of the crop include the Shrek's (Donkey has to be one of the classic characters in animation history) the Toy Story's, Finding Nemo, Ice Age and The Incredibles. Up to now I thought the Incredibles was an amazing film. Both technically and story wise. However, I think this has been surpassed by Pixar's Cars.I have to admit that I went into this film not expecting much. Reviews were pretty average and the trailers weren't all that spectacular. I definitely got my moneys worth though.The visuals in this film are beyond compare. Even little things like how the cars travel on a new road compared to the newly sealed road. Absolutely brilliant. The opening sequence is an action spectacle to rival any live action blockbuster. It probably even surpasses them. The backgrounds in this film just blew my mind. This is artists at their extreme best.The thing that really makes this film worthwhile though is the characters and story. That's one thing that Pixar and particularly John Lassiter have never compromised over. I think the man is a genius and Walt Disney must be smiling in his cryogenic freezer.John Lassiter is that rarity in film-making. He is an excellent artist who wholeheartedly embraces state of the art technology to put his great storytelling abilities to good use. Filmmakers don't come along like that often. I think he can be compared to Walt Disney on those terms. He has created classic characters and stories while moving film technology along in giant strides.There's not much more I can say about this film but I look forward to every new Pixar film that comes out and they haven,t let me down yet.John Lassiter will go down in history as one of the greats and he truly deserves it. Good stuff.",10,0,0,22 June 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Almost equal to the first.
",I enjoyed The Two Towers almost as much as Fellowship. I liked the Helm's Deep battle and still think it is better than any of the battles in Return of the King. However as with most epic movies I find the little moments are the ones that define it as great. A tree with it's leaves on fire rushing towards an oncoming torrent of water to put it out. The obvious happiness of Smeagol as he finally rids himself of Gollum. Even Frodo's gradual slide into darkness as he spits venom every now and then at Sam. These are what make up a great story and that's what made Fellowship so great. The Two Towers are full of these as is the whole trilogy. The only disappointment in this film is the Warg attack. Very shoddy effects in an otherwise flawless movie. Very well done on all accounts.( Apart from the Warg attack.),10,1,1,12 May 2005
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," What I expected
","Just came back from a midnight showing in New Plymouth, New Zealand. Have to say I loved it. It didn't feel like an Abrams film. It felt like a Star Wars film. I have grown up with Star Wars. I was nine when I went to the original ( I refuse to call it A New Hope ). Empire Strikes Back is my favourite film of all time and I don't care what the basement detractors say, I liked the prequels and they get an undeserved bad rap. They're movies, they're entertaining, get over it. The Force Awakens has everything you want in a Star Wars movie. The acting was good as was the action and special effects. If you're a fan you owe it to yourself to go see it. If you're a hater you probably still will and then spend the rest of your time on the net complaining how George Lucas raped your childhood and JJ is a hack. Don't listen to the haters go see it for yourself. You won't be disappointed. Footnote. Daisy Ridley sometimes looks scarily like Keira Knightly.",10,25,73,16 December 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," An astonishing achievement
","What can you say about the third movie in the trilogy. Bloody marvelous for one. Peter Jackson takes the credit for the trilogy but let's not forget the contributions of Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens. Jackson is good at the blood and guts and the spectacle but Walsh and Boyens are obviously the heart behind the quieter, yet no less emotional scenes. There's Richard Taylor's almost impossible monumental undertaking of every detail behind the scenes. There's Howard Shore, Andrew Lesnie, John Howe and Alan Lee, Grant Major and numerous others. Too many to name here.The flaws I saw with this film were it's final twenty or so minutes that seemed to drag on for too long. That's pretty minor though considering the tripe that usually ends up on movie screens.Although Return is the least of the three movies it still has some of the most emotional. Sam and Frodo's moments at Mount Doom are some of the best in recent cinema. Also when Aragorn tells the four Hobbits that they bow to no one. It still brings a tear to my eye.The trilogy is probably best viewed as one whole movie but will always be seen as three parts due to the fact that it took us two years to view them.The best reason in years to go to the movies.",10,1,3,13 May 2005
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A Classic that rewards with repeated viewings
","I rate Nightmare as my third favourite horror, only behind The Omen and The Exorcist. Freddy Kreuger is one of the all-time great characters in movie history and he is played with the right amount of gusto and unnerving dread by the underrated Robert Englund. He embodies this character so well that there is no way anyone else could play it. Testament to the fact that they got him back for Freddy Vs Jason.Some people knock the sequels and it is true they don't have the horror of the first but they have that one staple ingredient that never leaves. Freddy.I can remember the film coming out in the mid eighties but being young I never had the nerve to rent it. I had had been scared s..tless by a viewing of The Exorcist and didn't plan to go through another few sleepless nights like that. After number three (Dream Warriors) had been out on video for a while, curiosity got the better of me and I rented it. A decision I'll never regret.People who know me know the story of when I was living in London and a friend of my cousin told of a great new film that was out. It was called An Angel at My Table and he said I should go see it. Standing outside the Prince Charles Theatre in Leicester Square I was standing there looking at two posters advertising the films playing. One was Angel the other was Nightmare on Elm Street 5. Needless to say I went to see Freddy. My cousins friend was disgusted. I upheld my decision which was the right one because I went and seen The Piano three years later and that is two hours I can never get back.It is a tribute to Freddy and his creator Wes Craven that I still enjoy the odd scare, although there hasn't been a horror film since Nightmare that has come close to that feeling of exhilaration and fear.Thanks.",10,1,2,3 February 2009
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Best movie ever. No contest.
","People who know me ask me what my favorite film is. They expect me to say Star Wars knowing what a big fan I am. While Star Wars remains the movie that made me love movies in the first place it is Empire that cemented them.I can't think of a more perfect movie for the artistic medium that is film. Empire crams everything in that a die-hard movie fan wants.It has the best villain in the history of film. It has the best special effects action sequence being the snow battle on Hoth. It has the best space sequence. The asteroid chase. And even though everyone loves the Millennium Falcon I still love the Empire's Star Destroyers. Very cool.Even though Irvin Kershner directed you can feel George Lucas's stamp all over it. I've seen Kershner's subsequent films. He is good with actors and dialog but is out of his depth with pacing and special effects. Saying that though, he and Lucas complimented each other nicely on this film. Both needed the other and it works for the film.Also one of the great supporting actors of modern film was introduced here. I'm not talking about Billy Dee Williams or anyone. I'm talking about the sage Yoda. One of the best characters in modern film. And all he is is rubber and wires. A brilliant melding of art and technology.Revenge of the Sith comes out next week and all I can say is that it will have to be very very very good to knock Empire of it's pole position not only as my favorite Star Wars film but my favorite film entirely.",10,0,1,13 May 2005
The Simpsons Movie," Best comedy ever
","I was living in England when the Simpsons first appeared on sky TV there. From the first episode 'Simpsons Roasting On An Open Fire' I have been a devoted fan and am laughed at by some people all these years later for being a thirty eight year old man who loves a silly cartoon. I don't care. The Simpsons is the best show on TV and I don't think the episodes have diminished that much over the years. Homer is still the greatest character in TV and now cinema history.I just went with my nineteen year old nephew to the Simpsons Movie in New Plymouth New Zealand and I have to say I have never laughed so loud or hard in a movie theatre ever. Matt Groening and co. have done such a great job that I can see this film becoming one of the biggest hits of all time.Don't listen to the naysayers. It's everything that the TV series is but it is so much more. This movie has a unique feel to it and I'm still smiling from seeing over two hours ago.I saw no faults with this film. The thing I'm most pleased about was the fact that it concentrated on the family and left the supporting characters as they should be, supporting. Also I feared that Burns and the Power Plant were going to be part of the plot but was pleased to see they were relegated to walk on parts.I was wondering how they were going to improve on an already brilliantly animated show but they stepped up and pushed the envelope even further.Good on you guys. My favourite comedy films used to read 1. Life of Brian 2. Holy Grail 3. Airplane 4. Dumb and Dumber 5. Borat. Now I have to put Homer and family at the top.D'oh!",10,2,8,26 July 2007
