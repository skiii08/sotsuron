Resident Evil: Afterlife," A Huge Disappointment
","Absolutely hated it. I've played every game, followed the stories and I HATED the first three movies. I thought I might actually like this one but I was wrong . . . This movie is regurgitated Resident Evil 5. There are some parts that are literally taken from that game word for word and several sequences identical to the game. I spent almost the entire movie waiting for something exciting to happen and it never came. I suppose someone must've given them an infinite ammo code too. How many times did Alice fire her S&W 500 revolvers (a five shot revolver) without reloading? Maybe I'm being overly critical because I know a thing or two about guns and the people who made this film obviously knew NOTHING . . . I could go on and on about why I say that but I'll spare you. Probably what upset me the most was that they FINALLY put Chris Redfield in a movie and gave him a small sidekick role! Stop making these garbage movies and calling them Resident Evil!",1,12,23,16 September 2010
