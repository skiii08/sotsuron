Walk the Line," a boring deja-vue
","I really don't want to hurt no one. It seems, I'm the only one who didn't enjoy this movie at all. I did enjoy many musician bio-pics, but this one was boring in every aspect: The story is a deja-vue (Bird, Ray ...), the old country music and the movie was just not directed intensely, emotional or interesting. The pace was slooow, the story was sloow, the music was slower and I didn't see any romance (just a guy insisting and a woman giving in after all). This was a major disappointment. Maybe it's not the movie, maybe it's Johnny Cash himself that was so boring? And no, I don't think it's the cultural difference, since I enjoyed so many other similar American movies.",1,12,25,9 January 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Yes: Attack of the cloned movies
","Three thoughts.Isn't it strange that the sequel #4 is copying everything but Star Wars? This movie is partially copying: The lord of the rings, Monsters Inc., Gladiator, Total Recall, Chackie Chan-Movies ... and many more. But you can definitely say it didn't copy any of the Star Wars series.When I saw a movie I ask myself: Did I have fun? Did it make me laugh? Was I excited? Did I cry or feel petty for anyone? Did I like the female actress? Was the male actor ok? How were the supporting roles? Was I impressed by the story, the effects, the music, the locations, the dialogues or at least by the money spent? You're guessing right: No, No, No.......I have seen every Star wars Movie at the Theatre the year they came out - yes, I'm that old. This flick should be a great sample for film students and professors should tell them to make a decent movie just by cutting it and adding new music. OK, the movie would be 45 minutes only, but it can be done, I'm sure.Verdict: Don't even copy this movie, George Lucas already did by making it.",1,1,4,30 May 2002
Any Given Sunday," Boring
","Any Given Sunday is a movie about a man getting older. It takes Oliver Stone an excellent cast, a great cameraman and a giant crew of excellent people to make a senseless, boring film that is definitely one hour to long - and considering the script even two hours to long. A waste of time, talent and money if you're not excited by american football.",Null,0,0,24 May 2002
Hart's War," At the End, you hate the movie
","Good Film, good acting, even the story was interesting. I liked that it had its turn in using clichees and not proving them right all the time. As a european it's strange to see movies nowadays that end like this. The last Castle and Windtalkers just ended the same way - and being born after WWII the last 60 seconds of all these movies remind me of war propaganda - are these commercials for volounteering for Irak?",Null,0,0,7 October 2002
