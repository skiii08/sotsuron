Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Best of class
","Sacha Baron Cohen has maintained a moderately obscure profile on Australian TV but Da Ali G Show ran long enough that a reasonable percentage of people would be familiar with his work. I was never really a 'convert' but it usually managed to not be cringeworthy enough for 10 minutes or so of viewing. Borat was one of the characters that made me warm to the show, as I wasn't familiar with the aspect of UK culture that Ali G was parodying, and the German guy was too over the top. Cohen's interviewees seemed to be in on the joke most of the time but I'm sure this wasn't the case in the early episodes.After a few year's absence, a movie-length feature has been given to Borat, to be unleashed across the Atlantic on an unsuspecting populace. There's something about the Americans and the way they react that makes them such an entertaining target for obnoxious behaviour. When Tom Green (and Jackass) went to Japan I couldn't help but feel they were an undeserving target, given their politeness and large amounts of patience. The American culture is built on assertiveness and unmitigated self-expression, resulting in some fairly eye-opening reactions.From New York to Los Angeles Borat charts a range of U.S. attitudes and behaviour. What comes as a surprise is how in a few instances Borat's behaviour is the least outlandish. Luckily violence is not threatened (that we see) but you could still say Americans seem to be practiced in dealing with trouble makers. Generally any American production I see on TV is undiluted (maybe with a Brit thrown in for good measure) but Borat provides a good yardstick for American behaviour, especially when he gets picked up by a group of students on an alcohol-fueled road trip.As painful as Borat can be at times (a remote control can alleviate this) it's the most purposeful and sophisticated Jackass-style comedy you're ever likely to see.",Null,1,3,5 February 2007
Fight Club," Fight Club or: The Schizophrenic Adventures of Edward Norton
","While watching this I thought I was watching one of the most important films of modern times, a film that was going to deliver a message about the value of fighting, but then a really tacked-on ending threw a cloud over everything I'd seen up until then and I knew this was one that would sadly fade away into obscurity as merely one of the better films of the year.
I was genuinely taken by surprise by The Sixth Senses surprise ending, one that made me think 'that's pretty clever, it all makes sense now', but I was angered at how cheap the surprise ending was in Fight Club, it cheapened what could have been a powerful piece of social commentary. I rate it four out of five stars because most of the film is top-notch, and Fight Club should be seen by any regular moviegoer at least once.",Null,0,1,28 May 2003
Finding Nemo," Part irritating kids film and part spectacular underwater adventure.
","Okay, so Pixar have to release films under the Disney banner guaranteeing that all of their films will have a happy ending, appeal to kids from toddlers up and have the occasional syrupy, manipulative heart-tugging scene thrown in. But Pixar being Pixar, arguably the finest computer animators in the business, know how to use the freedom of the computer animated world to create previously unseen spectacles and go where no motion picture has gone before. We all know we want to see Pixar films, is there really any reason to be reading reviews when the names 'Pixar' and 'Disney' on the cover say it all?",Null,0,0,25 January 2004
Hot Fuzz," Have the right expectations.
",Shaun of the Dead parodied Zombie films (although I had not seen Romero's films) and by all appearances Hot Fuzz was a parody of the cop/action genre. The films starts off this way but I felt like the writers had nowhere near enough jokes to fill a movie so they had to invent a story. The lead character moves to a boring town (for a policeman) which doesn't seem like the most interesting way to start a police/action story. The small country town setting could have come straight out of Heartbeat and only Simon Pegg's presence throughout keeps the film from descending into amateurism.Timothy Dalton in a very enthusiastic performance is revealed to be the town villain but a Scream-like plot is introduced before he can be hauled away. This extends the film another half an hour but it left me wondering what the film was supposed to be about.I think watching Shaun of the Dead may have given me false expectations of this movie and I think if I knew that it was something more akin to The Parole Officer than National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon I could have enjoyed it more.I found Hot Fuzz entertaining but I felt they could have done a lot more with the opportunity and that it's probably best suited to the domestic British audience.,Null,0,0,17 December 2007
Troy," A different subject matter.
","I only became aware after doing some research on the internet that Troy was based on Homer's Illiad (which is on my 'to read' list). My initial impression was that Troy was in the vein of Gladiator, although covering a different subject (which it is).The performances seemed a bit stilted initially, I was worried that Eric Bana might be falling short on the acting skills. I noticed all the other actors including Brad Pitt gave the same delivery which left me conclude that perhaps they'd done too many takes in a row. I got used to that anyway or it wasn't a problem, the events of the film were interesting enough that it fell by the wayside. The casting was good, I always think Brad Pitt does well in non-pretty boy roles, even Orlando Bloom who's still riding the post-Lord of the Rings wave suits his character overall. It's reassuring that Eric Bana had the presence to pull off his role convincingly, and this film will surely look good on his resume.Troy doesn't have much in common with Gladiator except it involves war and is set in ancient times, it covers different themes and is more philosophical, thanks to Homer no doubt.Troy was a pleasant surprise for me, the film was better than I thought it was going to be. I can understand how small things can affect how big a film is in the high pressure environment of the US box office, but with its worldwide presence it'll still be remembered in years to come.",Null,4,7,10 March 2005
The Day After Tomorrow," Did Not Disappoint
","Let me get started by saying that I like Godzilla, I consider it to be a pretty well done film of it's type. I expected a brainless but enjoyable action/monster flick and that was exactly what I got. Seeing that The Day After Tomorrow was by the same guy, I thought 'must be good' as it seemed to have an interesting scenario and decent actors, Quaid and Gyllenhall. I'd heard that it got some bad reviews, and on here there were a fair amount of the same, but given that the feelings toward Godzilla were mixed I felt I could safely discount them.From the opening scenes in Antarctica I knew this was going to be good, I was glad I didn't wait for it to come out on DVD, and even if the science was fairly heavily stretched I wasn't expecting a documentary on climatology. The weather will never change from today's weather to an Ice Age over a week in a single storm, but if that were to happen it'd be pretty spectacular. Overall this is another slick, visually appealing film by Emmerich and anyone who likes this type of film should definately see it in the cinema if they haven't already.",Null,0,1,10 June 2004
Ocean's Twelve," Not a serious effort
","With the original cast present I was expecting Ocean's Twlve to be at a similar level to the Ocean's Eleven remake, although the fact that being a sequel requiring a completely new storyline did make me wonder.The film started out well enough and wasn't bad throughout but it became apparent it was aimed at the makers of the films themselves as soon as the 'pretend to be Julia Roberts' scene started. Why this scene was written, shot and included in the film is perplexing and undermines the entire film, if they shot this sequence and watched it themselves for some laughs I could understand. The rest of the film isn't too bad but it's not at the same level as the first and large paychecks must have gotten all the cast back. I had hoped Ocean's Twelve wouldn't be just another crap sequel but what can you do.",Null,0,0,13 April 2005
Alien," Great Film
","Recently saw the Directors Cut version in the cinema, much, much better on the big-screen than on the horrible 20-year old VHS tape I saw it on the first time last year. It's wierd, I saw Alien the last out of all 4 Alien movies, I used to watch Aliens when it was on TV every year in the late 80's/early 90's, must have seen that half a dozen times.I imagine that watching Alien for the first time back in 1979 before anyone knew of the 'Aliens' must have been incredible, I felt a little closer to those original Alien watchers with my big-screen experience. The movie had much more impact, was more immersive and made me jump slightly several times in the cinema. I'm not sure what scenes were added for this version but it seems surprising that scenes were cut in the first place considering the running time is under 2 hours.Alien is a damn good film, pipped at the post by Aliens for all-around best Alien film. Alien is definately the scariest of the lot and is an expert film in every regard (I'm still not sure about the use of dripping water though). The film had a slightly 'Thing'-ish quality in that there's a lone beast that can stike at any time, and it's not clear who is friend and who is foe, it was good to see all these now well-known actors in younger bodies trying to save their own skin. See this at a cinema get if you get the opportunity, or watch the DVD on a big screen with surround sound in a darkened room.",Null,1,3,11 December 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Good special effects
","This movie reminds me of one those games with really great graphics but not much gameplay. You could pause this film at pretty much any part and frame the resulting image on your bedroom wall, each individual frame looks that good. But after seeing the film and the documentaries on the DVD it's obvious they concentrated a lot more on the looks of the film than the story and characters. The original trilogy was close to perfection because it had great special effects, characters you get to know and love and a really great story spanning three films. It looks like this trilogy will the king of special effects, but with characters you don't really care about and a story that doesn't have any real impact.That said, Episode 2 is hard to beat for popcorn entertainment. The only thing that actually annoys me when watching either episode one or two is it's childishness. I've heard George Lucas say that Star Wars are kids films, and it seems like he wants to leave no doubt that these latest additions are kids films.Episodes 1, 2 and 3 may not be remembered in the same light as 4, 5 and 6 in time, but they do the job (in a very visually appealing way) of showing the world and telling the events that led up to Star Wars: A New Hope.",Null,0,1,13 December 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," Pleasantly average
","I'm glad the Wachowski brothers didn't completely lose their touch after making the first Matrix, thankfully they dispensed with the time-wasting fight scenes and overly long action sequences for this second sequel. The actors seemed a little tired in the delivery in some of their lines (the opposite for Hugo Weaving, he seemed madder than ever) and the Oracle's been replaced by another actor (just found out about Gloria Foster' untimely passing). The effects are as good as ever, important characters get injured or maimed, and the film is a decent enough length to tell the story properly (ends a bit too quickly after the climax though).Spoilers ahead: I thought the man-machine war was resolved a little too easily for my liking, I always thought it would end with one side wiping out the other, instead of the machines basically giving the humans their freedom (who was behind that face? and why did he suddenly 'see the light'?). And what of the after-effects of this freedom? I would have liked to see a little more of the beginnings of this new world order. I'm satisfied with the ending but the Wachowski's could have mapped out a bit more of the post man-machine war timeline.",Null,0,0,18 November 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Terminator 3: Viewer Judgement Day
","Terminator Three could have been way, way worse than it was. Considering the James Cameron had nothing to do with it, it was a reasonable effort. Not brilliant, but reasonable. It would take someone to really get into the mind of James Cameron to have a chance of continuing his efforts in his place, and as this wasn't done the universe of Mostow's film isn't too synchronous with the universe of Cameron's films. Mostow isn't what could be called an all-round director, he's strong on action but weak on everything else especially comedy, although perhaps the writers need to shoulder some of the blame. The new Terminator wasn't too bad, it seemed like an advanced model over the T-1000, if nothing else. The only real question I have to ask is what was Arnie's obsession with sunglasses? (I did have a laugh when he put on the first pair of sunglasses though, about the only joke that didn't make me groan).T3 didn't tarnish the name of Terminator films as much as Alien Resurrection tarnished the Alien films in my opinion. I hope a fourth Terminator isn't being planned as one extra one is enough, anything extra they make will end up being distributed in large numbers as part of future box sets.",Null,0,0,15 March 2004
"I, Robot"," Good for what it is
","Being a fan of Asimov and having read all the Robot novels and short stories I was interested to see how this would turn out when I heard it was being made and was a separate story in the mold of a Robot short story. Having now watched the film I was on the whole pleased, it was overall a good film with no major weaknesses. Will Smith is good in this type of role (Bad Boys, Enemy of the State) and doesn't disappoint, Susan Calvin however was a typical 'Hollywood' casting job, maybe I need to re-read the short stories but I always imagined Susan Calvin as more of a typical female scientist type, something along the lines of a (heterosexual) scientist version of Ellen DeGeneres, but casting hot-looking women as the scientist seems to be the established order...The whole murder plot was really what carried the film and made it interesting, and disposing of robot control made for a good climax. I felt I had seen the 'A.I. imprisoning humans to protect them from any possible harm' thing before, more than once, that was the only real area where the writing let me down. With these sorts of films (eg. Paycheck) I'm willing to sit back and enjoy the ride rather than look out for inconsistencies, as long as they're minor I'm willing to overlook them. I, Robot gets a thumbs up from me and I hope to see more science fiction adaptions of this standard in the future (perhaps a tad higher).",Null,0,0,6 December 2004
Tropic Thunder," An actor's movie
","This film was probably a lot more fun to make than it is to watch (for people not immersed in Hollywood culture anyway). Numerous actors get to ham it up, quite well on most occasions but the film serves as nothing more than an excuse for actors to commit the craziest stuff they can think of (and get away with) to film. Robert Downey Jr. playing a black character right out of the 70's? Ben Stiller playing a range of roles from a 'full' retard to Charlie Sheen in Platoon? Tom Cruise playing an obnoxiously aggressive bald fat guy? It's all here but the question is, is it fun to watch? For me the answer was moderately so, so overall this collection of acting had little substance and made for an unsubstantial viewing experience. I've seen much less enjoyable comedies but from the IMDb rating and the cast, I couldn't help feeling that there should have been more in store. I will give it credit for being watchable, not sinking to any real lows and not running out of ideas 3/4 of the way through which gives it enough points to bring it up to an average comedy. Perhaps for me this is a lesson in having heightened expectations.",Null,0,1,25 December 2008
Men in Black II," Pretty Good
","I must have been in the right frame of mind to watch this (which always helps), I thought it was more polished than the original. Where I felt I was let down toward the end of the first one (seemed to build up to something but never really delivered) this one was straight out solve the current crisis of the day and see what the MIB crowd are up to 5 years later.With the abundant hype of the original absent I had no prior expectations and was able to better appreciate the Sonnenfeld humour and enjoy sequences like the dog singing part of 'I will survive', or people on a train platform not even batting an eyelid when a huge worm whizzes by. It's good to see that MIIB is a proper sequel and not just one commissioned by a studio because the first one made a lot of money. Definately one to rent or buy on DVD.",Null,0,0,25 December 2002
Pi," Something Different
","Probably only interesting for people who have at least some interest in math, Pi is a refreshing departure from the stuff that clutters the rest of the movie shelves. The story is a little bit unbelieveable, but that doesn't detract from the account of an uncommon type of leading character, and some interesting concepts like spirals and Hebrew letters corresponding to numbers.I found that the commentary tracks on the DVD were vital for making more sense of the ending. Recommended for any open-minded movie watcher.",Null,0,1,6 January 2003
Children of Men," Visually appealing dystopian fiction
","I don't normally review a film right after seeing it, but the hodgepodge of reviews and 'helpful' votes seemed to warrant my two cents. Children of Men has a few big-name actors, with the solid Clive Owen, Michael Caine playing a hippie (testament to his acting ability that he is convincing) and Julianne Moore (I guess this had American funding so they couldn't have an all-British cast).The cinematography is good throughout, and British nature and urban environments make for a good backdrop (in my opinion). However a lot of the time I couldn't shake the feeling that I was watching staged set pieces, I wasn't sucked into the the film. The directing in general seemed a bit ham-fisted, like it was someone directing their first feature. The premise is interesting but I'm not sure if much was done with the concept (I guess we can attribute this to the writer of the novel the movie was based on). I'm not sure what the story is supposed to be about really, the plot seemed to be a way to highlight various aspects of this dystopian society. Again, the dramatic sequences lacked that 'real' feeling, like seeing a film set filmed through a home movie camera for behind the scenes featurettes. I think the film has a lot to offer and would be worth a repeat viewing (most films I cannot say the same for). It may be slightly overrated on IMDb, but then again Finding Nemo didn't grab me and that's still in the top 150.",Null,1,6,18 February 2008
Mulholland Drive," A unique way of storytelling
","It seems to me that David Lynch's idea behind this film was one about messing up with the universe, switching people around. Kind of like two parallel universes intersecting through the work of some filth-covered man-type creature who posesses a blue box of unknown powers. It reminds me of a science fiction story with two parallel universes crossing over and playing havoc with the characters.The story is presented entirely on the surface and just presents the facts, not explaining why and how any of it is happening. There are only a few clues and key scenes to give an insight into the background that produces the events happening on screen. I'm not sure if David Lynch had definate ideas about the storyline, but this is what the story seemed to be about to me, and one that links all the clues about the box and key, the switching of identities, the dirty man and the body of Diane Selwyn in the bedroom.Definately one to see just for the unusual viewing experience, or if you liked other David Lynch works.",Null,0,1,22 July 2002
The World's Fastest Indian," Inspired by real events.
","After the comments that were circulating on the internet a year or so ago (inaccuracies etc.) I passed on this title, but after learning that The Bank Job was directed by Roger Donaldson I decided that The World's Fastest Indian was worth checking out.I have to hand it to Donaldson he does know how to put an entertaining film together, and in the case of this film the less you know about it before seeing it the better. I was surprised to learn that it was a low budget film but from the cast, 60's setting and cinematography you wouldn't know it. There was no denouement though which was a mistake in my opinion (Donaldson says this was to avoid sentimentality but it seems more like he had to keep the film under 2 hours), it's the only departure from the otherwise fine storytelling on display throughout.Regarding Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Burt Munro, I saw the 1971 documentary on the DVD and apart from a lack of physical similarity, he portrays Munro as borderline autistic whereas the real Munro came across as a tinkerer, someone with callouses on his hands who spent all of his time doing practical tasks (like a farmer, say).I think what I will take away from the film will be the sequences shot on the Bonneville Salt Flats (the mountainous setting looks great) and Munro's achievement in building an extremely fast machine on a New Zealand pensioner's salary. It is deflating somewhat to learn that Munro was a frequent traveller to the USA (he visited ten times) and only started competing there when a local time trial held on a public road in Christchurch was discontinued.Like I said the less you know about the film beforehand the better and even if it is loosely based on real events it's still a good film starring the dependable Anthony Hopkins.",Null,0,0,27 September 2008
The Matrix Reloaded," The middle of the story
","I had to avoid a lot of trailers and interviews on TV before seeing this so I could go in not knowing what to expect. The first one was such a great viewing experience in the cinema that the second installment was a must-see in the cinema as well. Being two and a quarter hours into the story line, 'The Matrix Reloaded' loses the coolness factor the first one had of exploring the paranoid fantasy (that you yourself may have entertained) of everything we experience just being a computer simulation. The story seemed to be told on a slightly different level than the first, going more into the destiny of neo and the humans vs machines battle rather than telling an on-the-surface account like the first one did. This wrecks the consistency a little bit, but I didn't consider that to be a problem here.The Matrix Reloaded answers some questions (and raises more); We get to see Zion, Neo's increasing powers, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) getting a lot more interesting and dangerous, and the part the matrix itself plays in the destiny of the man-machine confrontation. I thought there was too much time spent on highly choreographed fight scenes (making them look more like an elaborate dance than a spontaneous fight) early on, towards the end of the film there was a considerable quickening of the storytelling pace as if to make up for lost time.It's not perfect, but all in all the Matrix reloaded is another kick-ass viewing experience, and takes it's place in what will be one of the great sci-fi trilogies.",Null,0,0,28 May 2003
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A special effects demo by ILM, who seeks to be the Pixar of the blended live action/computer animation world.
","After the previous two installments of the Star Wars prequel trilogy, discerning viewers know what to expect of Revenge of the Sith. A special effects demo by ILM, who seeks to be the Pixar of the blended live action/computer animation world. We know it's nothing more than a kids film, that the acting is uninspired, and that the absurdities will fly thick and fast.Revenge of the Sith has the benefit of actually having some storyline, making me wonder if the first two needed to be made at all. The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones could be condensed into about 20 minutes worth of key scenes, giving a full background to the events in Revenge of the Sith (which could itself be shortened by 20 minutes with no consequence).Lucas's reprisal of Star Wars film making is over with this installment, which might bring some relief to genuine Star Wars or science fiction fans. With practically every scene having CGI in it, I understood why Lucas didn't have the last two films directed by someone else like he originally intended. Given that most of the film is made in the computer lab, there wouldn't be much point in having someone else oversee the ILM computer animators.The computer effects are impressive, they're getting near the point of looking believably real but that point is still some years off. Impressive visuals are really the only merit of Revenge of the Sith and the entire prequel trilogy. In terms of storytelling, Revenge of the Sith is the only one to have its moments, but they are literally moments in an unbelievable 'history' of the original trilogy. I will take episodes 1,2 and 3's version of events with a pinch of salt and stick to my original notions and beliefs of the original trilogy. I believe 'young Lucas' knew what he was doing and will ignore the prequel trilogy, having satisfied my curiosity.",Null,3,5,22 September 2006
Identity," Good but a bit cheap and gimmicky
","Identity has a good cast, non-stop use of those rainmaking setups and an entertaining story. I could tell they were going to pull a fast one at some point when the red herrings were being dropped and we were kept guessing who the killer really was. The twist was about as farcical as I expected, however most people don't seem to mind given the IMDb rating (currently 7.2), and reviews I've read of another film with an infamous twist, Fight Club. I don't think this is supposed to be a big film, so for what it is (90 minutes of entertainment) it's not bad. The film's greatest asset is it's cast.",Null,2,4,3 January 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," They've done it!
","This is one of those rare cinematic events that only comes along every 5 or 10 years (but usually not on this scale, the last major trilogy with this level of impact was the original Star Wars trilogy over 20 years ago). I am including Fellowship of the Ring and Return of the king in this review.The men are too 'pretty', I had doubts in the back of my mind that other actors could have done a better job than the ones chosen, and there is far too much use of the 'teary-eye'. And in some areas I thought the interpretation could have used a few adjustments. That's the negative out of the way, now for the positives. The locations could not have been better, it's a good thing Peter Jackson is a New Zealander or he might never have known about New Zealand when scouting for possible shooting locations (seems like so long ago when all this was just an exciting LOTR enthusiasts project). The use of models makes the landscapes real in a way Industrial Light and Magic could never manage, when I first saw those stone statues on either side of the river back in Fellowship of the Ring I could not believe how real they looked (until I found out they were not computer generated). The blend between real and special effects is so seamless that it feels like you're really there in middle earth, it all comes together in such a way that a part of your mind says 'these must be real locations'. The computer effects are surprisingly good, considering the Weta computer lab that made them was set up from scratch, Gollum gets the distinction of being the first believable computer generated character used in a live action film.Lets face it, Peter Jackson and crew have very good material to work with, Tolkien has provided them with a story that is considered the best among all fictional books written to date (LOTR regularly topping surveys of people's favourite book). Jackson and crew have matched the spirit that Tolkien displayed, bringing to the screen the story in a way that Tolkien himself sitting in the directors chair probably couldn't have done.People who have read the books have always wondered when a proper effort would be made to make a film of them, and this trilogy is the kind of book-to-movie conversion that everyone hopes for.",Null,0,1,13 February 2004
