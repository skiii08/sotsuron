First Man," A Spectacular Achievement
","Just saw this on the festival circuit. It is personal, scientifically accurate, breathtaking and a deeply affecting film. For those rating without watching or by listening to a certain 'news' outlet's spoilers. It's not at all how they made it sound. The flag is there AND that's not the point. Just see it; it is spectacular on every level.",10,149,356,3 September 2018
