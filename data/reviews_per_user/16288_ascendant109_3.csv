Requiem for a Dream," Not Another Darren Aronofsky Movie!
","Darren Darren Darren. When will you stop making movies!? Seriously, I am really starting to get tired of your 'style.' And you've only made two 'wide release' films (sorry about all the quotes, if I don't put them there people who like the film will debase my review solely on the fact that the words in quotes aren't correct). While I do think that this film is better than his first opus, Pi, it was by no means whatsoever a great movie. Back are Aronofsky's clich√©s; the 'hip-hop' shots (the various fast action sequences used every time the characters do drugs), the snorricam, his penchant for the artistic flair. Requiem also borrows Pi's offbeat soundtrack. While good if not great standing alone, the tunes are poorly matched to the scenes (ergo the beautifully slow title song for all the fast-forward sequences). Aronofsky also steals other director's trademark shots. Victims include David Fincher, a great director, among many others. However, the film is not without it's moments. The acting is all around solid, if not breakthrough in some cases. Ellen Burstyn was fantastic as the deluded mother and Jennifer Connelly was equally magnificent as Harry's beautiful girlfriend. Leto's performance is satisfying, if somewhat forgettable. Most people I talk to have never heard of Leto or can't name a movie he has been in. Wayans' does a terrific job of not hamming his role up. Where he easily could have been funny and over the top he restrains himself and accepts his quiet and intelligent rope. Kudos to you Marlon, and you Darren, for keeping the reigns on him. While I may not buy this movie for my personal collection I would recommend that ANYONE thinking about doing narcotics see this movie beforehand (or just don't even consider narcotics). Even Mr. Aronofsky can't ruin it entirely with his mishmash of artistic detritus.",1,6,12,4 March 2005
Pi," The Story of a Director Obsessed With Himself
","Where can I begin to start hammering at the ungodly mess called Pi? Let me start with Mr. Aronofsky. While this is his directorial debut he has the gall to immediately dub it 'a Darren Aronofsky film'. Right away he has gotten on my nerves, but I was willing to put that aside if the movie fulfilled the hype. So much for hoping. What follows the opening credits is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Aronofsky pumps it so full of bullshit that its only message is the director's, a pathetic 'Look how artistic I am!' He throws in the token surreal moments, flash shots and angles (I'm so damn tired of the pill popping sequence!), annoying face cameras, and the most convoluted and incomprehensible story ever to be allowed on screen. In my opinion it never should have been. Avoid this catastrophe if you can.",3,5,8,4 March 2005
Moon," An excellent piece of contemporary Sci-fi
","Good science-fiction is hard to come by these days, but 2009 blessed us with what I view as two contemporary classics in 'Moon' and 'District 9.' Science-fiction, much like the Western, is past its heyday and usually struggles to find connection in a society with an ever-growing dependence on technology for survival. 'Moon' succeeds by being a modest, almost chamber-drama about the isolating and alienating effect technology can have on our lives. It conjures up a wonderful vision of loneliness and the longing for human contact. Sam Rockwell gives the performance of a lifetime, conjuring up anger, confusion, sadness, and humor in this multifaceted role.I appreciate that the director, Duncan Jones, didn't try to make too big of a movie. He treats this small and delicate picture with the care and nuance necessary to leave an impression, at least on me.Highlights from this film include excellent set design and application of miniatures with CGI being avoided almost entirely. I can't say that I miss it. The craftsmanship and attention to detail remind me of '2001' and '2010' in their dedication to quality. The soundtrack is superb as well with sad piano pieces and more modern industrial-sounding melodies.This movie is not for the science-fiction fan who wants explosions, gunfire, space battles, or any sort of action. It's a slow-burn of a drama, with questions about what the difference between a human and an individual is. Don't pass up a chance to spend a quiet evening with this film.",10,1,6,28 March 2010
