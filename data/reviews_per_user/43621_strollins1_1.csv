Howl's Moving Castle," A woman finds herself on a dangerous adventure to find her old self and makes friends along the way.
","Howl's Moving Castle is a wonderful movie for all ages. It took me a few times of watching it to really understand what the movie was about and what was going on, but it makes a really good point. You really need to not take things for granted and you should live your life. I thought this movie was excellent at its use of imagery and details. It used a lot of creative examples of real-life events and issues that correlate to our world, and that's what I like to see. Yes, live your life how you want to and be who you want to, but don't let others try to control you and how you look or who you are on the inside--or outside. In the end, it's really what you make out of it. Seeing things that I could relate to really helped me as well, so I got think of it that way. At first, I kind of thought it was a little similar to the Wizard of Oz, but it's not really like that at all. You can see what I mean if you have seen both, but that confused me at first. So if you get confused by watching this movie the first time, just try to process it another way, or watch it again. It will really help you out. It is a little harder to understand, but you'll get it. Watching this movie taught me this and I hope that it inspires you to feel the same way.",10,0,1,24 April 2015
