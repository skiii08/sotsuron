The Blair Witch Project," The scariest movie on God's green earth!!
","When I walked in and sat down at the theater, I expected to be scared, but not THIS scared.  Like other horror flicks ths characters did stupid things (go out at night, follow a person with a voice when they obviously weren't able to make sound) but UNLIKE other horror flicks (i.e., scream & stuff) you understood their panic.  The unique way the first person view was used, helped the audience get seriously disturbed.  The audience usually couldn't SEE anything so they had to rely on their hearing sense alone.  It was such a new experience... it seemed so real that it scared me more than any other 'unreal' films could.  No special effects to be comforted with just the unknown, sudden fear inspiring panic that the characters passed on.  I loved this horror flick and warn those weak of heart shouldn't watch this.",10,2,3,21 July 1999
Akira," A True Test for Anime Fanatics
","Like wise, Akira was (and is) considered a great Anime film for one reason, it was one of the first to be brought to American television. That is the only reason. The Animation itself is NOT typical Anime, just a fat Americanized version of the thin slender, big eyed wonders that wander the screens of Japanese houses. The only reason I gave it a 2 is because of the fantastic story line that has stayed almost the basis for all Anime plots brought to America. DROP IT EVERYONE, Akira is NOT A CULT FILM, just the first Anime seen by general public.Accept the fact that it sucks, no one is forcing you to like it. I hope Japanimation lives forever but no through this pale version of a violent, fat, Disney cartoon.If you want to view authentic 'anime' watch Ninja Scroll, Demon City Shinjuko, Appleseed... basically everything else except this.",2,15,36,23 July 1999
