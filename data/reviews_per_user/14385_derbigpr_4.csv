Hereditary," Chilling, sustained, proper horror
","This is one of the very few modern horror movies that does the horror right. There's not a single jump scare in the entire movie, just a constant sensation of horror, at moments extremely intense, enough to send shivers down your spine. The movie industry has brainwashed people into believing that horror movies are about jump scares, and I've been saying that it's the cheapest way to fool people. Jump scares are scary by definition, they just startle people. There's a difference startling someone and really making them scared. The ending could have been better, but this is a proper mystery/horror movie. Acting is excellent, it's properly filmed, the soundtrack is haunting.",9,1,2,14 September 2018
The Irishman," Great, but far from perfect.
","Let me be clear, it's very difficult reviewing this movie without taking into consideration the names in it. There's obviously bias, there has to be. This movie is like an end of an era, and it features all the actors that made that era as amazing as it was. However, it's clear they're all past their prime, and it's clear they're all just a small fraction of what they used to be. Pesci is great, it might actually be his best role ever, unfortunately, he gets relatively little screen time and plays a side-role. Pacino is good, but overacts a lot. De Niro? Oh boy... what did they do to him. I really, really don't like how CGI-heavy this movie looks, and it's pretty obvious when you know how these actors look in person and how old they are, and then compare that to how they look in the movie... BUT DE NIRO, I've seen animated movies in the last few years that seem less CGI than his face. First of all, his eyes are stupidly blue, like...impossibly blue, you've never seen anyone in your life with eyes as blue as his in the movie. Combine that with the fact that almost every scene involving him is a close up (for a reason I'm getting to now), and it's very hard to ignore.Now... De Niro is 76 years old, but in the movie they attempt to make him look young... and it REALLY, REALLY doesn't work. Any scene with him walking or doing anything but sitting is really awkward. He looks and moves like an old man. His hands and fingers are all deformed like an old mans hands, but he has a CGI face of a 40 year old. His assassinations look awkward, the way he holds the guns, the way he shoots, the way he fights..looks exactly like a 76 year old doing it.So CGI is pretty badly masking what it's trying to mask... another bad part is the gore. We all know mobster movies are full of blood, and this was no exception. There are plenty of people shot on camera, with blood splattering around, with bullet holes shown from close by, etc. The issue is, THEY ALL LOOK FAKE. BADLY FAKED, bad CGI, like in a low budget film, not a 160 million one.As far as the story goes, it's good, it's what you expect from a mobster/political movie, it's slow, long, but doesn't feel like it's dragging. The issue is you know how it's gonna end, and that's always a problem with movies based on a true story.To conclude, as an homage to these great names, it's a decent send-off. Don't expect a movie like Goodfellas, this ain't it. This is a much darker movie, focused much more on death, on people aging. There's not as much 'mobster romance' as in other similar movies, it's more a miserable story showing a movie realistic picture of what it's like to be a mobster, rather than focusing on expensive cars, suits, hotels, food, jewellery, etc. It's the most HUMAN of all mobster movies I can think of. Still, it leaves me feeling a tiny bit disappointed, because it's NOT as good as it would have been and could have been had it been filmed 20 years ago. And that's sad. Not only because of the movie, but because of the actors. Watching this makes it hard not to feel like it's a good bye.",8,5,10,3 December 2019
A Quiet Place," One of those rare times when I'm forced to write a bad review...
","...due to the fact that this movie has a 7.8 score as we speak, which is pretty damn high, especially for a horror movie, and I just don't see how. That said, it's possibly the most overrated movie I've seen in a long time, in fact I can't think of another movie that was this heavily overrated. I don't understand how a movie with such mediocre acting, a very basic and superficial story with zero detail or depth behind it, so many brainless moments, so many obvious plot holes and things just that make no sense or things that nobody with a hint of common sense and intelligence would do... can have such a high rating. This is a type of movie that goes to extreme lengths with the stupidity of characters and the stupidity of the choices in the plot just for the sake of creating moments of tension that otherwise wouldn't be there, and I don't like that. I don't even have to mention all the lame jump scares that are there literally for no reason other than to be jump scares, which is a showcase of a bad horror movie in 9 out of 10 cases, since anyone can just create random loud things that happen out of nowhere when you don't expect them, especially in a movie with no talking and only ambient sounds 90% of the time.It feels like a movie made for people who like to shut their brains off while watching, because that's the only way I can imagine watching this movie without being incredibly irritated by the stupidity of it almost constantly. I won't even go into how bad the design of the monsters is, how the things on their bodies happen opposite to the laws of nature (muscles on their heads working the opposite of how they actually do) and how little sense from a biological and evolutionary aspect creates like that make, it's virtually impossible they would evolve anywhere in the universe, that is if they're aliens, which I assume they are. It's just too deep to go into and the deeper you go into it the less sense it makes, which is why this is a movie, as I said, for people who like to keep their brains on stand-by most of the time. Usually IMDB is pretty accurate when it comes to ratings and I very rarely disagree with them, but this one is so incredibly off that it feels like the makers of the movie hired a couple of hundred people to give the movie high scores. This is a 6/10 movie, AT BEST, all things considered, I have to give it a lower rating to balance things out.",4,4,6,6 July 2018
Midsommar," It's one of those 'IQ test' movies
","If you dislike it, you failed the IQ test.All these people giving it 1/10 are just intellectually incapacitated and therefore incapable of enjoying anything out of the ordinary, and incapable of enjoying a movie that doesn't have a well defined beginning and end.Watch it, unless you're one of those people who thinks that horror movies should have jump scares every 30 seconds and that all movies need a happy end.",7,1,6,2 October 2019
