Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," George, what were you thinking?
","Star Wars:  Episode I was a decent movie; but it was just plain awful compared to the other Star Wars movies.  The movie had action, special effects, and even a few memorable lines, but it lacked a lot of heart.  Much of the acting was stale; granted, some of that can be attributed to the fact that the protagonists in this movie are on more of a professional than a personal level as opposed to the informal relationships in the original trilogy, but still, there is no excuse for some of it. 
The inclusion of the midi-chlorians is arguably the worst thing ever created for a Star Wars movie; that's saying a lot considering this is the movie that gave us Jar Jar Binks.  And what's up with Yoda's look in this movie?Still, the movie is not without its moments.  The pod race is exciting, and the brief memorable dialog ('There's always a bigger fish.') is refreshing. I didn't feel it was too bad while watching it in the theater.  It's basically a watchable movie, not a great one.",5,0,1,13 June 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Everything that Harry Potter isn't
","I know, I'll probably make some Harry Potter fans mad, but that's what I think.  Don't get me wrong.  I liked the Harry Potter films.  They were enjoyable.  And that's all they were:  enjoyable.  (So far I've only seen the first two.)  They were essentially copies of the books, and not films on their own.But Lord of the Rings is something else.  It stands on its own as a film. It isn't just a recreation of the book.  I must admit, the first time I saw the film, it was a tad boring.  However, I think that it grew on me, and now I see just how good it is.There are some flaws in the movie.  Some of the sequences feel rushed (even in a nearly 3 hour movie).  Also, while Frodo, Gandalf, Saruman, Strider, and the other hobbits are introduced well, Gimli, Boromir, and Legolas seem thrown in.  We have little idea to the motivations of them entering the fellowship (although with Boromir, that is revealed later).Unlike the Potter films, it doesn't feel like an overlong commercial.  The point seems to be the film itself.  Middle Earth looks fantastic.  WETA does an amazing job with what they have to do.  Acting is superb, especially from McKellan as Gandalf (but then, that probably goes without saying).  Overall, I give it 8 stars out of 10, 9 originally, and minus 1 for boring me when I first watched it.",8,0,1,9 June 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A worthy film, though not the best of the three
","'The Two Towers' is certainly a good film, though, for me, it was not the best of 'The Lord of the Rings' Trilogy.  I preferred 'The Fellowship of the Ring', and 'The Return of the King' blew them both out of the water.  But TTT is still a good film, and I would recommend it to anyone.Being as there are fewer characters introduced, and less exposition for the story, the characters are not bogged down by starting a new story.  My favorite plot line is the one that involves Frodo, Sam, and Gollum.  Gollum is amazingly animated.  He is so realistic, and far outdoes Dobby from 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.  I also enjoy the relationship between Sam and Frodo.  Jackson greatly portrays Frodo's descent as he begins to become consumed by the ring.  The other plotline, involving Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, Theoden, Eowyn, and Eomer is still well done, though at times, I feel that some of it could have been left out.  The flashbacks to Arwen seemed like they were only included to keep her in the memory of the audience.I appreciate Jackson's willingness to make this a good film, even if it means making sacrifices to the book.  Tolkien purists will be even more disappointed with this film than the previous one (though you all probably know that already).A worthy film, one that I would recommend.  7 Stars.",7,0,5,9 June 2004
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," An enjoyable movie, but nothing great.
","This movie was my first introduction to Harry Potter. Seeing it in the theater with a few of my cousins, I didn't know what to expect. What I got was a fairly enjoyable, though overlong, movie that kept me interested until the end. I was pleasantly surprised by the surprise ending; I remember going through the film thinking about the one dimensional plot, and I actually didn't see the ending coming.Daniel Radcliffe does a good job as Harry, but the scene stealer's are Ron and Hermione. Still, I would not consider it a great film. The special effects are impressive (especially the quiddich match), and the adult actors do a good job (especially Alan Rickman as Professor Snape), but in some ways it feels like a commercial, advertising for Harry Potter video games, toys, and the books.Good for a rental, but I wouldn't buy it.",6,8,17,7 June 2004
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Not too bad.
","This is my favorite of the four movies so far. The pace is brisk and keeps the action moving along nicely. Thank God the director realized that we don't need so much unnecessary exposition. Although that stuff might work in the book, for a movie, it just sets it up to be long and boring. It's already assumed that we know who Voldemort is, that they live in a magical place, that the students go to class. There is little time spent on whimsy and the wonders of the magical world. There isn't even a scene with the Dursleys. And that's perfectly fine. You shouldn't be watching this movie if you haven't seen the previous ones. Whatever exposition is given, is for anything we don't know about and the plot itself.Another good point is the acting. All three of the leads are doing a great job. I'm glad that they stuck with Ratcliffe, Watson, and Grint. They really get the characters across nicely. Also, the new professors and students taking place in the Tri-Wizard tournament are perfectly cast (and from what I understand, the actors are from the same areas as the characters they portray). The new Dumbledore is adequate, though not as convincing to me as the original (of course, that can't be helped). And of course, you still get Hagrid, and, perfectly cast, Snape.The plot is engaging and mysterious. However, I couldn't help but get the feeling that if I had not read the book beforehand, I might be a bit lost. Still, the mysterious portions are done very well, and I think would keep anybody guessing and surprised.SPOILER WARNING: I only had two problems with the movie. First, the beginning rushes too much. The characters are supposed to go to the Quidditch World Cup, but there is no footage of it. Yeah, I know, we've seen loads of Quidditch games through the first three movies, but it would have been nice to see the big one, especially since it's the reason everybody went to the stadium in the first place. Unfortunately, it seems the Quidditch World Cup had to be sacrificed to get in more plot.Second, there was not enough character development, especially for the other three witches and wizards in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. I mean, Cedric barely interacts with Harry at all. You'd think that they would give some more characterization for somebody who is killed off. And Krum and Fleur aren't that much better.END SPOILER WARNING All in all, I would say if you liked the first three movies, see this.",8,3,5,24 November 2005
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Didn't enjoy as much as the first
","I think that the main reason that I did not like this movie as much as the first, is that I had read the book first. Between the time I had seen the first movie, and Chamber of Secrets, I had read all 4 Harry Potter books. Sitting in the theater on opening day, I think the main problem was that I already knew what was going on. There were no surprises for me. Everything was pretty much as it happened in the book. I had not read Scorceror's Stone before I saw the movie, so what happened in that movie was more of a surprise.Still, it is an able movie. The actors do a fine job. The special effects aren't bad. The actor portraying Gilderoy Lockhart does a fantastic job, but the one who plays Tom Riddle left something to be desired. The movie also suffers from being way too long. I was sitting in the theater wondering when it was going to end. I would recommend this as a good rental, but I wouldn't suggest somebody buy it.",5,0,2,7 June 2004
Ice Age," Very Funny Movie. A lot better than 'Robots'
","This is an extremely funny movie. Although some of it seems stolen from other movies, it manages to pull off a difficult job: making a believable world that is consistently funny throughout. Undeniably, the best part is Scrat (or is it Scrap). Whenever he's on screen, I can't help to bust out laughing. Too bad he's not part of the main story. The main characters include a mammoth Manny (Ray Romano), Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo), and Diego the saber tooth tiger (Dennis Leary; apparently, they didn't think alliteration was appropriate for this character). All in all, these characters manage to get some good laughs (although they pale in comparison with Scrat). Sid can sometimes get annoying, but overall the three main characters aren't bad.There are plenty of good scenes, including a fight with a group of apocalyptic dodos, an amusing trip in an ice cave, and a final scene with Diego's pack. Some parts of the movie feel stolen from other movies. The pack feels like something from 'The Lion King' and the baby seems like it was lifted out of 'Monsters Inc.' Furthermore, although I'm not complaining about the voice talents, I wish they would do what Pixar does, and mine the creative depths of the staff as opposed to just going to large scale celebrities for voices.Still, this was an excellent animated film. I would recommend this over 'Robots' any day.",8,0,0,19 May 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A very impressive film
","I suppose I'm just adding my voice to the chorus when I say that this was a stupendous film.  Great acting.  Amazing special effects.  Wonderful directing.  One of the best films I've ever seen.It's still not the greatest movie of all time, though.  There are those that are greater:  Schindler's List, The Godfather, Citizen Kane.  But it's up there.  This is one of the few movies I've ever seen more than once in the theater.I was actually glad that Jackson included Shelob's Lair in this version.  It gave more screen time to the Frodo/Sam/Gollum storyline.  Throughout the whole scene, I was on the edge of my seat.  Even though all of the main characters are split up throughout the film, Jackson still manages to keep it as a cohesive whole.  The final climactic scene will keep you bolted to what's happening.There are some flaws in the film.  The fate of Arwen is rather confusing. (Sure, the average person visiting the LotR message board on a daily basis might understand it, but for the average person in the theater, I don't think there was enough background info to completely understand).  Also, the post climactic ending is rather long, although that's more to wrapping up the film than Mr. Jackson's mistake.A fine film.  9 stars.",9,0,1,9 June 2004
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Best Star Wars Movie
","This is the best of all 5 Star Wars movies.  With this came the rare sequal that isn't just a redo of the previous movies, but brings something new and different from the first.  In this, we get a startling revelation (well, at least in 1980 it would have been startling; that thing's been so spoofed, you'd have to live in a hole in the ground to miss it; but anyway, I digress), a question to tickle us for the next sequal, the best battle in all of the Star Wars movies, and a love story between Han and Leia.  This was more of an original story than the other sequals, since the story line revolved more around the individual characters than a great threat to the galaxy or a planet(Ep. 6:  A Death Star, how original; Ep. 1:  Naboo under attack).  The acting was good and the special effects were good even for an '80s movie (especially for an '80s movie).  Overall, best of the 5.",9,0,1,22 August 2004
