Blade Runner 2049," Great visuals but that's it! Not entertaining.
","Dude! You can't make a movie just to be philosophical and deep. I can read Friedrich Nietzsche for that. A movie also has to be entertaining, that's why it's a movie. No wonder this movie tanked at the box office. To make a long story short here's a direct quote from the director Denis Villeneuve himself about Blade Runner 2049: 'When you're working on a film you're in a bubble, and it was only when I came out that I realized we had made a monster. I won't do it again.'
I gave it 3 stars for the visuals.",3,7,12,18 December 2019
Fight Club," This movie makes no sense at all
",I tried to watch this movie before and couldn't finish it. I forgot why I couldn't finish and tried years later and see why again. Everything is over the top to force laughs out of you and it doesn't work on me.,1,1,8,9 April 2020
Thor: Ragnarok," Worse super hero movie!
","What a rip off this movie is? They used the title Thor to make a cheap version of the series. People gave it good reviews because of the basic humour... Really, I love a good comedy but Thor is not where i would try to find it. I would rather watch Dumb and Dumber over and over. Hulk acting like a baby, playing with a bouncing ball... Thor throwing a ball at a window only to have the ball ricochet back and hit him in the face to knock him flat? What is this?
Thor's hammer seems so light and fake. The movie sets look like Sesame Street. Wood panels cheaply painted with a bunch of bright colors. The costumes are ridiculous. The CGI is the worse, the special effects don't even try to seem realistic. Nowadays I can do better with an iPhone. Cate Blanchett is too good an actress for her role. 
The only character that brings back the usual Thor vibe is Idris Elba as Heimdall..
They should have begged Kenneth Branagh or Alan Taylor to direct this one too.
Really if you like Power Rangers or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles this movie is for you. As for me I'll clear my head by watching Black Panther again.",1,6,12,24 February 2018
1917," A masterpiece?
","This movie was shot to make you feel like you're accompanying the main characters. No wonder it got the Oscar for best cinematography.
Great acting, great action, great story. Not your average war movie with just killings. You feel for the characters and relate to them. Need I say more? Oh, did I mention that this is a masterpiece?",10,0,4,1 May 2020
