The Hangover," Wayyyy over-hyped...
","Don't get me wrong, 'The Hangover' entertained me and didn't bore me at all, but to see this movie in the top 250 and to hear all these 'rave' reviews it's been getting doesn't make any sense.It honestly wasn't really that funny. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the majority of the funny moments. I chuckled, but this movie was definitely NOT laugh-out-loud throughout material.I guess what kind of turned me off of the movie was the characters...I was very wishy-washy on who i did and didn't like throughout the film. I also felt that some of Allen's random and bizarre outbursts were unneeded, and he closely reminded me of Steve Carrel's 'Brick' from 'Anchorman'.Beside these gripes, the film was alright. A good summer movie, but I would probably not see it again, and I wouldn't pay more than 8.99 for this movie. But, don't take this review to heart. Go watch this and form your own opinions.",6,2,7,12 June 2009
500 Days of Summer," SO great!
","This movie proves that you should NEVER judge a book by it's cover! When I first saw commercials for this movie, it looked happy and almost like a typical romantic comedy...but the trailer just DID NOT do the movie justice.At times, '(500) Days of Summer' made me both laugh out loud (something I don't remember doing in theaters for a long time) and make me almost want to cry -- this well-acted film made a great impact on me because it seemed so real...this is one of the most original films I have seen in a WHILE! '(500) Days of Summer' also had the perfect chemistry between it's main characters; Jason Gordon-Levitt (as Tom) and Zooey Deschanel really looked like a couple...I think they should date. Haha.I loved this film because it strayed so far away from 'mainstream' and more materialistic romantic-comedies...it's darkness is almost unreal sometimes.Overall, a great film that I wouldn't mind seeing again, and you bet I'll be first in line when it comes out on DVD.8/10.",8,0,2,18 August 2009
Drag Me to Hell," The trailer was misleading...
","Seeing the trailer (which in my opinion, didn't make the film look all that interesting) and hearing some mixed opinions from schoolmates about the film, I wasn't too enthusiastic about this movie.But, after the premier, I noticed it's impressive 95% 'Fresh' rating on Rottentomatoes.com, and this being one of the only horror movies in what, 2 years(?), that has been rated fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, I thought I would give it a shot.And I'm glad I did! Drag Me to Hell had me on the edge of my seat practically the entire time. Also, the black comedy in it made it all the more enjoyable.I was a little skeptical about Justin Long; mind you, he plays his role well, I just couldn't help but think someone a little more...mature looking should have had his part.That small gripe aside, Drag Me to Hell was one of the most enjoyable movie experiences I've had in a while, and I would recommend it to any horror fan out there.",8,0,2,8 June 2009
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A Genuine Classic...one of my favorites
","I just got my hands on A Nightmare on Elm Street at a store a couple days ago, and I decided to watch it by myself. I've seen the movie tons of times, and I've decided to write a review about it while it's fresh on my mind...A Nightmare on Elm Street is about a girl named Nancy who suffers from nightmares all involving a strange man (Freddy Krueger), who brutally picks them off one-by-one (in their dreams), leaving Nancy to stop him once and for all.I must say that ANOES is not only one of my favorite horror movies, but one of my favorite movies in general. I love the atmosphere, (genuine) scares, and tension that Wes Craven brings to the table, and that's what makes it a great scary movie...something modern day horror movies ignore by trading in suspense with jump scenes and pointless gore.One of my only (minor) gripes about the film is that I wish it could have been better acted...some of the lines made me cringe...but hey, so what? I can live with it.A Nightmare on Elm Street will always be a classic, and one of the most influential horror films ever (in my opinion)...and to anyone who hasn't seen it, do yourself a favor and pop this baby in!",7,2,2,3 July 2009
