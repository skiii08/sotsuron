The Equalizer," Good update and revision of an 'oldie, but goodie'
","I enjoyed the old television Equalizer program and I feel that this updated, revision was exceptional. The theme of both the old television program and this movie is of hopefulness. It is a fantasy and it is entertaining. Unfortunately, the violence portrayed is just a representation of what happens to some people in real life, just like the suffering and struggling that is represented. This is the world in which some people live. That there are parts that could be realistic only makes the story suspenseful. I am not into analyzing the plot or character development. I am not looking for realism when watching movies or programs of this type. This is not a documentary. It could be escapism for some from a difficult life. That is what I enjoyed from the television series. The bad guys got their come uppance. I am just glad that sometimes that for the good, decent, ordinary people, there is a hero or superman to save the day! I have been a fan of Mr. Washington's since his early television days. To witness and experience his transformation from television actor to his growth of a superstar is impressive.",9,0,2,11 January 2015
