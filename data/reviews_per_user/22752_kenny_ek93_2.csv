Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Let the critics be nay-sayers. I loved it!
","Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides Yes! This one was was also great! At first you sense that another director is behind the 'wheel', but you'll get into it in no time. This is a bit less grand in scale, but this does not mean that the film is therefore less enjoyable. Similar scale to COTB. My only complaint is that the love relationship between Philip and Syrena could have worked better. Penelope Cruz is a great addition. I prefer her now instead of Keira. Orlando and Keira aren't really missed, but a reference to them would have been nice. Ian McShane as Blackbeard was BADASS!! Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa stole every scene, Gibbs was still as fun to watch. And as expected, Johnny Depp as Jack is back in top shape. Cameos by Judi Dench, Richard Griffiths and Keith Richards also were a welcome addition. The CGI is back perfectly fine(and there's less of it, which is great) and the locations are again stunning.Of course the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is fantastic again as expected. The story is somewhat simplified but no less entertaining. The mermaids surprised me very much, such fierce mermaids like you have never experienced Does Jack make it to the Fountain of Youth? To the movies and find out! I would say do not listen to critics and the race to the movies! If you're a fan of even 1 of the previous films, this one is not to be missed! Forward to part 5 and 6. PS: I went to the 3D and the 3D version worked great! The film was, like Avatar, filmed in 3D, not converted. Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides 9 / 10 Each POTC film has its minor flaws, but they remain my favorite movies, I do not prefer one over the other. COTBP: 9 / 10, DMC: 9 / 10, AWE: 9 / 10",9,0,0,23 May 2011
Iron Man 2," Better than the first, just 2 things bothered me.
","First off let me say i liked this one better than the first Iron Man, just because I felt this one was even more character driven and more cool characters than the first one. Also the build-up to The Avengers is really cool in this part with Samuel L. Jackson have a much bigger role than just a cameo. I especially liked the after-credits scene for Thor where they show people digging up Mjolnir in the middle of a desert.The Characters are much better presented in this one, both the old ones and the new ones. Especially Tony gets a much more emotional background concerning his history with his father and so forth. I absolutely loved Mickey Rourke as Whiplash/Ivan Vank, but the 1st flaw of the movie also concerns him. He is totally UNDERUSED, he's there for the beginning and the end, and in the middle part of the movie: he's barely in it. Gwyneth Paltrow was as charming and beautiful as she was in the first. Also Don Cheadle was a very good recast for Terrence Howard, maybe even better than him. Samuel L. Jackson looked cool and bad-ass at the same time as Nick Fury. The sexy Scarlett Johansson was also good as Natasha Romanoff. She was dangerous and very beautiful at the same time. She's got some pretty cool fighting moves up her sleeve. Sam Rockwell did a very good job portraying Justin Hammer. He was funny, nerdy and yet very evil.The Story is also very good with some pretty complex parts in it, like the part where Tony needs to re-invent the unknown element. That went a bit over my head. But every part of the story just felt right.The CGI is even better than in the first one, especially in the final aerial/ground battle between the Hammeroids and Tony.The Soundtrack was nothing special, just your typical summer-movie music. Nothing special, so nothing to complain. :PSo, the only 2 negative things for me where: 1. The under use of Mickey Rourke. I mean they said he was going to be the main villain in this one. And if he was he had way too little screen time. 2. The action scenes are too short. I would have liked in particular that the fight on the racetrack was longer. Don't get me wrong it was very good, just too short.Iron Man 2, a worthy sequel that surpasses its predecessor -----> 9/10",9,4,6,8 May 2010
