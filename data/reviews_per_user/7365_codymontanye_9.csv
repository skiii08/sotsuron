Casablanca," Very enjoyable
","Being that it is a renowned classic I had a lot of expectations when going in to watch Casablanca. But if I'm being completely honest I believe that it was a bit over sold, not to say that I didn't enjoy the movie; I really did enjoy it. I found the plot of the movie to be very engaging and not too hard to follow and the acting was absolutely amazing. I thought there was so much to take in, which I really enjoyed and there many round characters that had great character development. I really enjoyed the character of Rick and how he progressed throughout the movie. I also very much so loved all of the quick witted humor that filled the movie and you either got it or you didn't, it wasn't highlighted at all. And besides the writing and the performances of the cast I really loved the lighting used throughout the movie and thought that it helped to amplify the story significantly. Overall, I really enjoyed the movie and will most likely watch it again because I believe that there is a lot more that I could take from the movie, if I were to go back and re- watch it.",7,0,2,10 March 2015
Taxi Driver," Uncomfortable
","I was very excited to see this movie because I love the director Martin Scorsese. I have seen many of his films so knowing that he directed this really excited me, that and the fact that Robert De Niro had the starring role. Generally I would not consider this movie to be my type of movie because of its gritty feel and psychopathic nature of the main character. I really enjoyed the film though, but was kind of confused at times by the decisions that De Niro's character made. Honestly the whole film and Robert De Niro's performance kind of made me feel very uncomfortable, especially by the end of the movie. But I think that is a good thing and also a great testament to the acting skills of De niro and the directing skills of Scorsese. Right after I finished watching it I really didn't feel like I'd want to see it again, but after a bit of time I have had a reoccurring urge to go back and watch it because I feel like there is more that I could pick up on with a second viewing.",8,1,3,13 May 2015
Patton," Very long and Very Good
","Just like the summary said Patton was very long and very good. The film follows the story of George S. Patton during his time in World War II. George C. Scott did a great job in playing the role of the historic General, which made the length of the movie not as noticeable. I also believe the action of this film was depicted very well, which made it come across as very real. This was due in part to how the movie was filmed. I also really enjoyed the cinematography of the film. The film was so well put together in every aspect of movie-making; I can only imagine the amount of time that went into putting together a film this well and at this length.",8,1,1,13 May 2015
Annie Hall," Eccentric
","This is the first Woody Allen movie that I have seen and it was definitely an interesting experience. Both of the main characters were very awkward and neurotic. I really enjoyed this movie, but this is mostly likely due to the fact that I am a big fan of romantic comedies. The movie was very different from most movies that I've seen by including scenes that had dialogue at the bottom of the screen and times when Allen would turn and talk to the audience. As I said before I haven't seen any other Woody Allen films, but this film has made me interested in possibly seeing other ones of his to see what kind of filming techniques were used and just to see a film that is out of the ordinary.",7,0,0,13 May 2015
The Graduate," Very Witty
","I'm writing this review after watching The Graduate for a second time. I enjoyed it the first time through, but didn't pay enough attention to really get the most out of it. The second time through I enjoyed the film a so much more and I caught a lot more of the dry fast-paced humor that can be found throughout the film. I really enjoyed all of the performances in the film with Dustin Hoffman's performance really being my favorite because he really pulled off the awkward and intelligent character of Benjamin. Even though I watched it for a second time and I definitely enjoyed it more the second time, I still felt like the movie kind of dragged on towards the end of the movie. I can't quite put my finger on when it starts to feel this way to me, but just like the first time through it felt like it should have ended sooner.",7,0,0,13 May 2015
Singin' in the Rain," Classic Musical
","I had always heard about the film Singin' in the Rain and had always heard about how it is a classic. So finally I sat down to watch it and I really enjoyed the film. I got very drawn in at the beginning of the movie because I thought it was a cool concept having a film about actors, especially during such a time a crisis as the period where silent films were switching to sound. I found the humor of the film to be very enjoyable and constant throughout, along with the very entertaining and catchy song queues with a matching amount of entertaining dances. I wasn't very surprised that I enjoyed the film because I do enjoy the occasional musical from time to time, but this has definitely become one of my favorites. I found the movie to be very good and entertaining from beginning to end. My only problem with the movie, which probably isn't a surprise, is about the one musical and dance number towards the end of the movie that just goes on longer than it should have. It was a cool scene with lots of interesting things going on; I just believe it wasn't very necessary and could have been much shorter. Overall though, I do agree that this movie is a classic and I would recommend it to anyone who's ever enjoyed a musical.",8,0,2,13 May 2015
Pulp Fiction," Great Movie
","Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is an obvious classic and Tarantino's breakout hit. I felt like it was an odd movie with some scenes that were out of the ordinary and rather questionable. I believe that the way the movie was filmed you could tell that it was a Quentin Tarantino film. The shots used were not just straightforward angles, which made it very visually interesting throughout. I also loved the look of many of the sets that were used throughout the film with my favorite being to 50's diner that John Travolta and Uma Thurman were in. Overall, I found this movie to be very great and I would definitely recommend it to film lovers.",8,0,1,13 May 2015
Psycho," Obviously Great
","It's hard to say anything about this movie because it has probably all been said before, but I found Hitchcock's Psycho to be undeniably great. Embarrassingly enough I had just watched this movie recently for the first time ever and of course loved it. The film is filled with so many twists and turns from beginning to end that kept me on my toes, although I already knew of most of them already because I'm clearly the only person who hadn't seen the film. I loved the plot of the movie and how the viewer starts off thinking about the girl and the stolen money, when in fact it isn't about that at all. I also believe that this film is one of the best examples of Hitchcock's mastery of suspense. There are so many scenes that are filmed in such a way that really amps up the viewer's anxiety and I'm not just talking about the shower or stair scene. I think the scene that really showed this was towards the beginning of the film when the cop pulled up behind the woman. I loved how they filmed this scene because they filmed the cop from the point of view of the driver side mirror, which kind of made you anxious because it made you feel like you were being pulled over. I could say so much more about the greatness of this classic, but I'm going to stop before I repeat everything else that has ever been said about this movie.",9,1,2,13 May 2015
Rear Window," My New Favorite Hitchcock Film
","To start out I have to say how much I love Alfred Hitchcock and his films. And this film is just another testament to that fact. I absolutely loved this film from the beginning to the end. I got sucked in right from the beginning and not just because of the plot, but because of how amazing the set was. I thought the set was absolutely marvelous and I was glad that the whole movie took place within it and from the view of James Stewarts' character's apartment. Another aspect of the movie that I was very drawn to was the fact that film had a main storyline, with the husband across the way potentially having murdered his wife, but the film also follows the storyline of the other people in the apartment complex throughout the whole film. I also really enjoyed the soundtrack to the movie and how it was played on the piano by one of the neighbors, whose story was one that was also followed. Besides all of that, the main plot to the movie was great as well and I love that it was done from the view of the main character's apartment the whole time. Not only was this a cool and interesting way to film the movie, but I think it as an excellent way to build up the suspense. A good example would be in the scenes when they view the neighbor sitting in the darkness of his apartment with only the end of his cigar being visible. Overall, I loved this film through and through and I plan to watch it quite a few more times in the future.",9,0,1,13 May 2015
