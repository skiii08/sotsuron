The Devil's Advocate," Amazing. Seducing. Thrilling. Complicated but rewarding as it goes along. Beautifully directed and acted. Provides everything a good movie may demand.
","I heard the title and was like, 'Wow! Sounds amazing!' After all who doesn't enjoy those fascinating court scenes and the battle of wits among the men in black. The addition of a supernatural element of 'Satan' or 'Lucifer' or best known as 'the Devil' only highlights the beauty of this flick. It seduces you, thrills you and deviously makes you beg for more and at just the point you believe its all over, surprises you with the possibility of a new future. It was so amazingly directed with some fabulous work by the cast, offering everything one desires of a film. A highly satisfying film which can get creepy at parts but mostly you'd be amazed at how beautifully the characters are presented and how effectively they did their job. What makes it most satisfying is how it becomes complicated and rewarding as it goes along. It questions the priority between Love and Ambition. The addiction in winning, the seduction in love, the thrill in deviousness and finally the humanity in confession and morality in retreat come together to make a blazing red brew... 'The Devil's Advocate'.",8,2,4,3 January 2014
American Psycho," Story of a psychopathic narcissist. Full of Dark Humor. Awesome acting by Christian Bale. Humorous yet disgusting at the same time, that's the charm.
","You may see it as a simple psychopathic crime-thriller but it provides so much more than that. A crazy journey of a narcissist, misanthropic man who hates competition. It falls in the rare, emerging genre of Thriller/Comedy, and lives up to it. Supported by the magnificent performance by Christian Bale, this movie will make you laugh and scream(with horror) at the same time. You would see the most elegant man with the most unconventional desires and how gracefully he satiates his urges by fulfilling them. It is not a family film and it is best if you do not watch it with your family. True it can get rather gruesome at parts but that is the charm of it. If it can make you sick yet laughing, it has just done its job. A sparkling cocktail of humour and disgust will wash over you and you would be confused as to which to give into... job done.It creeps you out and stills makes you want more of the thrill. Some scenes can make you laugh your guts out. So if you are looking for a movie with Dark Humour, this is the best you can find.",7,0,0,25 December 2013
1408," Spine-chilling horror. Great concept. The ending however could have been more straight-forward.
","This was one spine-chilling horror movie with some beautiful work by the cast. What really makes this a 'thumbs-up' movie is the main concept of an 'Evil room'. For once it wasn't an angry spirit or blood-thirsty Vampires, but about a most normal looking room. The direction was fabulous and the horror punches came with plenty of adrenaline. I watched the movie with a smile on my face and a persistent chill down my spine. Some parts were rather predictable but as a whole package, it was well summed up. The ending however left me with a hint of 'Is it really over, or is there more to come?!' But I would definitely credit it for the acting, direction and concept.",6,0,0,25 December 2013
