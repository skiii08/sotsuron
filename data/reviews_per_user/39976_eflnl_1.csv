Requiem for a Dream," Feels like a nightmare, looks like a dream, a must see.
","Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), is growing old as a mother of a drugaddict son Harry(Jared Leto)in a home for the elderly. Her social life is limited to her housemates, the rare visits of her son and her television. When she gets an invitation for a tv. show, her life gets a new impulse. However, she realises how old and big she's grown. In order to look well on television, she's going on a pilldiet, not realising that she's actually taking speedpills. Her son makes her aware of that, but she's not willing to quit. Quitting, will destroy her dream... Both, Sara and Harry lose perspective by taking more and more drugs, till their lives are at stake...The plot of this movie is as deep as you can feel. The only question is how deep you want to go... Fact is that you're gonna be overwhelmed by the story, the music and the visual performance. Looking and experiencing the picture, you won't feel a moment of peace. But that's not the director's intention. A strong message is given... strongly recommended.",Null,0,0,20 July 2001
