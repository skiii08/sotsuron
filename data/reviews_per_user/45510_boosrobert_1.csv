Blade Runner 2049," By far the most boring movie in years
","Sometimes I'm really wandering how ratings are being set. IMDB rating 8 for this one?!
How could that happen...?
Almost 3 hours and NOTHING happened. Complete useless scenes that lasted for minutes and minutes. Even worse: a lot of those scenes without a single word.
But being rated with an 8 I thought it was me. I just had to be patient cause eventually this movie will get better.
Duh... NOT the case.
What a BAD BAD movie. Complete piece of garbage. Thank God Netflix provides a fast forward button, though unfortunately only 10 secs per click...
Must has used that one a hundred times.",3,6,11,21 July 2019
