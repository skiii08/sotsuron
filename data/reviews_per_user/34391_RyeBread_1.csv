Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," OK, but too anticipated
","I went to see the movie on the seat on my pants. I was really excited. But I realized it was way too anticipated. The movie went too fast, and you didn't really know if you liked the main characters or not. There were too many characters to remember. At the end of the movie, you forget Shmi even existed.The best part: the podrace. That was cool! The worst part: the wars at the end. What's the point in showing four at once? I got way confused.All in all, The Phantom Menace was okay, but the original trilogy is better. I know some huge fans camped out to see it, but I wouldn't have been one of them. This movie shouldn't be anticipated. It's just a movie, and not that good of a one.",Null,0,1,19 August 1999
