The Blair Witch Project," Scary as hell.....
","I was around maybe about 12 or 13 when I saw the Blair Witch project and I didn't hear too much from it. But gosh, this movie was just a knock in the head or something. This movie is really different, it's not your Freddy or Jason or your leather face, it's not your Final Destination films or your Saw films. What made it so freaky was because it was just so different from other movies. You start to wonder during the film, 'What, this isn't real is it???' As you might already know, the film is more of a documentary then it really is a movie. You don't know of the actors in the movie, nor the people and they seem so real. But also if you're planning to see this with your friends, don't. See it alone. Some movies are much more scarier seen alone, the Blair Witch Project it one of them. Not everyone is afraid of movies like these because they simply don't understand this type of horror. If you wanna be afraid of this movie be prepared to have scary things happen one step at a time. It's not all at once that is for sure. This movie will keep you watching. Again, see it alone. Or renting the movie will be a waste in my opinion.",9,1,3,27 December 2006
Silent Hill," God vs. Satan movie
","My mother and I were thinking this was just going to be another ghost movie. We both loved them. To death. And when we read the description we thought it would be great. But it is nothing like the despriction. It is a very, very bad movie. Very disturbing. This is like this years, 'The Exorcist.' It's worst than the Exorcist. This movie was more disturbing than the movie, 'The Omen,' will probably be. It will. I know it. It's more about God and Satan and the Salem Witch trails. People get burned alive and you literally see the skin melting away from their face and you see them on fire. You hear and watch a little child burn and keep on burning. You see the skin literally get ripped off a women and thrown at a door. You see millions of spikes coming and impaling a women and ripping her in half. Many other people too. I have seen a lot of gory movies. This one was the worst. I would rather watch Hostel than this, and that movie looks all gore and torture! This movie seriously made me want to be the best person I could be before I died. Don't see it. Not worth your money.",1,6,13,24 April 2006
The Butterfly Effect," Good movie!
","If you like movies with lots of drama then this is it. It's a very good movie that holds a very good story. If you've heard about somewhat scary sick parts don't worry. A dog gets burned alive in the movie but you do NOT see it happen. A little girl gets a hold of a dynamite and (Obviously) dies but you do NOT see it happen. You see a kid get stabbed but it's not like it's gory. A couple of kids stick a dynamite in a women's mail box while she's opening it and has her baby in her arms and you hear a explosion but you see NOTHING. Just happens like that, one, two, three and then it's done. Also, you see a man taking photographs of his daughter and her friend naked but it'a not sick. You see no private parts and they're just standing there, not doing it, not doing ANY sick things. Nothing bad at all. These scenarios do seem sick but it entertains you at least. It gives you great drama. Worried about Kutcher? He's fine. He doesn't ruin the movie and doesn't act like a dork. He takes the work seriously and does a fine job in the movie. Now the movie itself as I said has one of the best plots. There's never a boring moment, something big is happening every moment and it's not that age old, 'Amy is cheating on Toby!' drama.... Drama as in murder, past family issues being resolves, past kid memories that ended up wrong, etc. But to even give you a better tip, do NOT see the sequel. Now, that was just horrible.....",9,2,5,1 February 2007
Dog Day Afternoon," An American classic!
","To sum up this story is about a bank robbery that goes horribly wrong. For two hours it's all about what happens inside the bank where Al Pacion and his companion are keeping citizens hostage until they can get a way out without getting caught. Believe me, the plot might seem like a bit of a bore but it surely is not. I'm not into drama movies at all. In fact I don't even like them too much but this is an exception. The writing is brilliant and the characters are complex and so real. Mind you, this was based on a true story. And of course you won't find a comment where it DOESN'T talk about how brilliant Al Pacion was in this. :) True, this is probably his best role out there and one of the best in history. He didn't play it too over the top or too under it, making it an ordinary flat out boring performance. So, if you don't see this movie for the plot please...see it for Al Pacion. The man is a genius in his work and I promise you will not regret renting this brilliant movie!",10,6,7,6 December 2006
A Bug's Life," Overall good
","Of course this movie doesn't really fit into the category of a Disney classic, but which Disney films are these days? I'm sorry....PIXAR...film. Still. The plot was well, thought based on others, and the characters are very unique. I only gave it a '8' though, feeling it would somewhat bore people at parts but I found kids that still found it entertaining if they are aware of what's going on. The animation in the film is just brilliant. This movie is a movie to talk about how great 3D animation is. The story is set on the ground in a somewhat vacant part or something, and from their level you can see all the details to the single rocks on the ground. And if I'm going to talk about this movie I would like to bring up the character Hopper. I just watched this movie recently and it just dawned on me this character is a very underrated villain. He is smart, powerful and scary. He is also very serious but what got to me was how clever he was. I think people forget this about him and the actor who plays him (Lord help me, I don't know the actors name) is very well at playing him. He is now one of my favorite Disney villains. And that's all I have to say about that.",8,0,0,6 December 2006
Saw," Sick, twister plot...the best!!!!
","You would expect from a name like, 'Saw,' that this movie would be terrible. But titles are dis leading and so are the previews. This movie was a new refresh great movie unlike the everyday horror movies in theaters now. It was different and had great plots. It was suspenseful and the ending is the best. Everything made it great. The music, the clips from the flashbacks, you will love the ending and a lot of people I knew loved the ending. You would have never guessed and when you see it you want to jump up and down. It's just so great! This movie isn't really to gory at all! I think you have been informed about the foot sawing off scene. Though one of the characters does it in the movie you barley even see it. It makes you twitch back but at the same time keep you watching and every second of the movie is filled with surprises! This really isn't a horror, though. It's more of a mystery suspense thriller. It makes you jump at some parts but you won't live the theater feeling scared. You'll leave it feeling satisfied and loving it!",10,0,2,24 April 2006
Hercules," Your child won't cry!
","I've been looking at the comments that aren't for this movie (Mind you, there aren't many) and found the main reason why people didn't go for it. It seems the people that disliked this movie are the people who are too uptight about Greek mythology and how this film was wrong in that base. They wrote how this was wrong or how this Greek never did this, never did that, but seriously people....THIS IS A MOVIE!!! Movies aren't real! None the less do they have to make sense! Not to mention this is a children's movie! I also read a comment by a parent on how their little girl cried during this movie or something? Well, do you think it's because of the movie or it's just her? Millions of kids saw this and didn't cry, there's just something wrong with THAT kid. Anyways, this movie is one of the best Disney films out there. It's one of my personal favorites of all time and is a true Disney classic. I guarantee you, your child has a very little chance of actually crying during this movie and wanting to turn it off. The songs are good, the plot of wonderful, it's a great ending, and the bad guy kicks much butt. Seriously, out of all the Disney bad guys Hades takes the cake. That is all. :)",10,1,3,19 August 2006
Click," The good and the bad
","I feel the need to give this movie a five just because of the brilliant ending. First, let's start with the beginning. The first hour or more is pretty bad.....poor joke after poor joke. Of course there were some moments but manly you could hear embarrassed chuckles around you throughout the movie. It's somewhat interesting but to me, comedy is the hardest to make. You don't only need to entertain people, you have to also make them laugh and if they don't then not only will not like this movie but they will feel embarrassed for it. Before even seeing Click I had the idea that it was going to flop. And it did. At first. You see, the ending had a much, much more serious tone. While you watch maybe 30 minutes of the ending not only are there emotional scenes but it also really makes you laugh for real at the funny parts. For people who have even experienced anything emotional in their life they seriously might cry. The ending also made you leave with a happy and warm feeling for Adam Sandlers character and, you know, just made you smile. If you watch this movie try watching, just try, watching all of it. The ending is the best part. It's the only reason why I felt the movie wasn't a total and complete flop.",5,1,4,8 July 2006
