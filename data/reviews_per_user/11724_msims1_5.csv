Howl's Moving Castle," Read the book for the story. Watch the movie for animation.
","The visuals are captivating. But I watched the movie thinking it might be a good adaptation of the fantastic, wonderful book by Diana Wynne Jones. It wasn't. It has characters from the book, but they are not as Ms. Jones wrote them. It has some some plot lines, but they are not as wise or loving as the book. Those who admire and rave about the animation are right - it IS beautiful. But I wanted the story I read. And this is not it.",4,0,1,15 November 2019
Captain Phillips," 2009 Event Comes Alive on Big Screen
","My husband wanted to see this film more than I. The actual event in 2009, as all pirate/hostage events in the news, angered and frustrated me. Why would I want to see the Somali pirates capture an American cargo ship, threaten its crew, and psychologically damage them for life? AGAIN! But I went, and I'm glad I did. The movie starts slow, wraps you in warm, fuzzy family moments, and sets up the relationship of captain to his crew & Somalis' motivation for pirating vessels. The action, when it starts & it starts quickly, made my heart race. Overall, it made me think about why people do the things they do when they are put in situations that they choose or are chosen for them. I didn't want to feel anything for the pirates, but I felt some sympathy for them. I felt admiration, respect, and pride in the captain and crew of the cargo ship, and our Navy, which ultimately helped rescue them. I felt great sadness for Captain Phillips and for his ordeal. Had I not known the outcome, I don't think my heart could have handled the stress and anxiety throughout the movie. CAPTAIN PHILLIPS is an excellent film, with fine actors and a tightly written story. It is based on a real event, and feels more like a documentary than a dramatization.",10,4,14,3 October 2013
About Time," Chick Flick for Men
","My husband accompanied me, but warned me that he would not stay if it didn't interest him after 15 minutes. He stayed, and gave me the summary, CHICK FLICK FOR MEN.It's a fantasy because it deals with living in the present and the past at the same time. It's a romance because it's about young love, and love expressed between two people who have been married for a very long time and still feel that spark that brought them together. It's a family film about siblings loving one another so much that one of them might just jeopardize his future to save his sister's life. It's a cautionary tale for those who practice habits that could sicken them or get them killed. It's about life, and truly living one's life even when faced with the prospect of death. The acting is solid, and Rachel McAdams is lovely and inspiring. The rest of the actors are amazing as well, and you want to believe that it is all real. But the story itself can be so unbelievable. Just go with it. It's like a really high calorie dessert that tastes so good you don't care if you gain five pounds. I enjoyed ABOUT TIME immensely, and I could watch it again and again.",10,188,229,9 October 2013
The Bourne Ultimatum," Take Dramamine before watching on the big screen.
","Even though this movie was number one over the weekend (August 3-5, 2007), and you might be tempted to see it after reading all of the glowing reviews on this site, I advise viewers to take DRAMAMINE or another motion sickness medication prior to viewing it. The motion in this blockbuster is not just unsteady, it's jarring & irregular. It's all over the place! Couldn't anyone afford a steady-cam or tripod??? Did no one involved in this movie know about 'discretion is the better part of valor' or restraint of any kind (motion AND violence)?? Yes, this movie is non-stop action, and fans of Jason Bourne and/or the Robert Ludlum novels will flock to see it regardless of what I (or others who agree with me) say. Still, be forewarned. If you do not like roller-coaster movies with some inconceivable plot lines, do not pay to see this movie until it is in the video/DVD store or on cable. And if you do enjoy these types of movies, you might want to bring along the Dramamine!",5,0,5,7 August 2007
Enchanted," ENCHANTED lives up to its name!
","Almost everything about the movie is enchanting from its two locations ('happy ever after' Andalasia vs. 'happy never after' New York City) to its multi-dimensional characters (campy cartoons vs. reality survivors). Pip, the endearing chipmunk, steals the show in both worlds. Amy Adams, as Giselle the intrepid, out of her element Princess, is a perfect foil for Patrick Dempsey's Robert, the staid and logical NYC lawyer who attempts to help her find her way home. Both have true loves, but their providential meeting alters their perceptions not only of love, but of friends, family, and life in general.The stereotyping of characters, and some continuity errors, were a little disconcerting. Yet the metamorphosis of those characters into believable people, and the engaging storyline, eradicated all of these concerns.If you love fairy tales with inevitable happy endings, see this movie. ENCHANTED is a movie in which almost everyone finds his or her true heart's desire, which could be exasperating for cynics, anyone who has no interest in romantic love, and those who abhor show stopping musical numbers.",9,2,4,5 December 2007
