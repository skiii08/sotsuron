The Rock," Welcome to the Rock
","Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage team up for one of the most brilliant and explosive action movies of all- time! you  It was accompanied by a stand out performance by Creep Show alumni Ed Harris. Now many would feel that all action movies have an unmotivated 'bad guy' this film however showed true to life 'villain.' Harris is holding SF and most of the East coast for ransom. Why? Because he feels that America has forgotten the dead war heroes families. Sean Connery was put into the Alcatraz because he was the only one who ever escaped the Rock. An elite team lead by Michael Bien, The Terminator and Tombstone, to save 50 hostages and take out Ed Harris and his henchmen. Cage was put on the task force to dismantle 4 bombs pointed at the East coast. The movie was suspenseful, daring, humorous, and witty. Again a four star performance to Ed Harris in one of the most memorable villains. if that is what you call him, of all time.",10,1,1,12 November 1998
Forrest Gump," Life will truly change when you see Forrest Gump
","In all my years and all the films I have seen in my life Forrest Gump was truly one of the greatest. A simple minded Forrest Gump travels through the 60's. 70's, & 80's and even though the times change Forrest stayed the same. A college football star, a war hero, a ping pong champion, and shrimp tycoon. Tom Hanks pours out one of the finest acting performances in film history and is supported by a tremendous cast, Gary Sinise, Robin Wright Penn and Sally Field. Robert Zemeckis directs a true winner and the special effects were flawless. Life truly will never be the same after you see Forrest Gump. 4 star classic",10,0,2,23 January 1999
The Waterboy," A Waterboy to Dick Butkis?
","Adam Sandler takes on a role of a moderate mannered waterboy to a vicious killing machine. Now I must say that the movie had its laughs, but fell short of any real super comedy. The ending game in the movie was not only predictable to the last play but old and overdone. Henry Winkler and Kathy Bates stole the show, but even Bates's character was overdone and tiresome by the end.",5,1,1,11 November 1998
