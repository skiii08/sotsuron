Gremlins," Just....wow
","Who's genius idea was it to make a Christmas movie with like six mini Krampuses? Savage bro. Just could have gone with a little more jack-in-the-box action, and the iconic snow globe shot at the end, but those are just nitpicks. Krampus RULES!!!",10,0,1,22 December 2018
Aquaman," Impressed...
",THIS MOVIE WAS SO GOOD! Krampus came in at the perfect moment! Right in time for the holidays. Looks like Krampus has a little gift for you Aquaboy.,10,6,11,22 December 2018
Elf," Okay, but...?
",Will Farrell was great in this movie but what happened to the evil jack-in-the-box? Also they made Krampus too jolly for my liking. I prefer the rendition of Krampus that has him eating children. The 2015 movie Krampus expresses the holiday spirit in a much more satirical and poetic way. Highly recommend Krampus (2015).,7,2,5,22 December 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Killer movie, missing a few key components...
","Loved it, great movie. I'm just disappointed they left out such an important point in Freddie's life. His bout with Krampus, when the holiday demon tried to eat his family would have made for an amazing set piece half way through when the film started to drag on. Make a sequel, and make it with lots of Krampus!!!",8,0,4,22 December 2018
The Fast and the Furious," Fast and Curious?
","You may be able to outrace the cops, Vin Diesel, but you can't outrace Krampus.",1,0,3,22 December 2018
The Godfather," Come on guys....keep it original
","I love everything about this movie, the acting, the imagery, the intrigue, the score...the only thing I have a problem with though is the title. Like can you really sleep at night? Like honestly REM sleep, knowing that you single-handedly stole the title of The Godfather from the demon of the north himself, Krampus. Adjacently, The Godfather 2? *Bleh* more like Jack I'm the Box Rises. Come up with something original next time, for God's sake.",10,0,1,22 December 2018
