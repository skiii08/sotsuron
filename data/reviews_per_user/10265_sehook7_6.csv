Moneyball," Worth Every Minute
","I originally didn't think this would be a movie that would hold much interest for me. It just looked slow and uninteresting. All the buzz around this movie and the fact that I see a lot of movies is what got this movie into my DVD player. In the end, I really truly enjoyed Moneyball.I found Moneyball to provide a bit of everything for me. The storyline/content was interesting, and was a bit educational since I didn't know this true story before seeing the film. The movie was also dramatic, heartfelt and even provided a few good laughs. The movie kept my interest throughout. In addition, Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill were phenomenal. It is no wonder their performances created Oscar nominations. Moneyball definitely comes with my recommendation.",8,0,1,31 October 2012
The Hunger Games," Hungry For More
","I was so excited to see The Hunger Games and had high hopes for this movie. I so badly wanted it to be spectacular because the book was so fantastic. The Hunger Games fell a little short for me though.First the good, I found the acting to be quite good. I felt for the most part that the movie represented the book quite well. Of course the book was far more detailed, and some aspects of the book were left out of the movie. I don't feel anything necessary was really left out of the movie. This is a plus. I think the storyline is fantastic. It is certainly intriguing and entertaining.The negative for me was that the movie was a bit slow. It felt like it dragged on at some points, and at the same time some of the book details felt rushed.All-in-all, I would certainly recommend seeing The Hunger Games. It is worth it.",8,1,6,31 October 2012
Midnight in Paris," Sells Paris But Little Else
","I had no idea what to expect when I rented this movie. I actually decided to rent it because I LOVE Rachel McAdams. Unfortunately, her character was not likable in this movie and her role was not all that important in the grand scheme of the movie either.This movie was different to say the least. I found the parts that took place in the past to be the most interesting. Although I understand what this movie was saying, basically 'the grass is always greener on the other side', that is not the aspect that pulled me in. The storyline was interesting, and I was intrigued by the famous people of history brought in.The downside of this movie is that it isn't all that entertaining. I wouldn't watch it again out of any fond love for this flick or for entertainment value. I would absolutely never consider this movie a comedy. I didn't laugh once. If anything it is a romance/drama. I really don't get the huge success of this hardly heard of film either. It just doesn't stand out as a great film to me, although the ones that win awards rarely do.The one lovely aspect of watching this film is that I absolutely want to visit Paris now. If they were trying to sell Paris or vacations to Paris, this flick would do it!",6,0,0,31 October 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Rough But Good
","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is quite excellent. I really had no desire to see this movie, and had little idea to what it was about. Fortunately, this film turned out to be beyond my expectations.Rooney Mara is absolutely fabulous in this flick.The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is intense, intriguing, vulgar, disturbing, dark, a mystery, and entertaining. What more can you ask for in a movie?! I would definitely recommend this movie to others who enjoy the mystery/suspense genre, however because of the vulgar/disturbing aspects of this film, it may not be for everyone (certainly NOT children).This movie is long (2 hrs 37 min), although it didn't feel like it. I was very much wrapped up in the mystery/characters/storyline that the time flew by. I look forward to seeing the other movies in the series!",8,1,4,31 October 2012
Prometheus," Wanted This To Be Good - It Was Not
","I was so excited to see this movie, and even more disappointed with the turnout. I found this movie to be too much like the Alien franchise, and not a very good prequel if that is what they were going for. The Alien franchise itself is far better.Prometheus was slow for me. There wasn't enough action, it was too predictable, and there was far to much existentialism (that mind you never went anywhere.) Charlize Theron's character was pointless and was a poor use of a beautiful talented actress. Noomi Rapace on the other hand did a fantastic job, and was pretty much the only highlight of this flick.Overall (and obviously), I was disappointed with Prometheus. I had high hopes. And the 3D aspect is completely unnecessary as it always seems to be.",4,1,5,31 October 2012
Fast Five," Fast & Enjoyable
","For the fifth installment of the Fast & Furious series this installment wasn't half bad. In fact, I found it to be better than some of its predecessors.Fast Five has a great cast of misfits and they all come together nicely in this flick. This movie is very fast moving and doesn't waste a second jumping into the plot. Fast Five has a great combination of action, light humor, and even a wee-bit of suspense.I did find this movie to be highly predictable though, and unfortunately, this was not 'The Rock's' best work. With that being said, despite its minor misgivings, Fast Five was highly entertaining, the cars/car driving was fabulous, and the chemistry among the actors is fantastic.",7,1,2,31 October 2012
