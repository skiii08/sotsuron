The Blair Witch Project," Where's the terror?
","First I want to give this movie top credit for its promotion.Brilliant!! Great idea, gripping trailers, absorbing web page, etc. Unfortunately the movie just doesn't deliver. It is completely transparent and as a result completely ineffective. It is not scary in the least and at times when its supposed to be is often utterly laughable. If I had heard this story around a campfire I would have been totally creeped out. However, outside of that setting its a lame duck. I went into the movie with very little prior knowledge which didn't seem to make the experience any more enjoyable. Should you see this movie? If you want to know what the hype is all about by all means but if you want entertainment save your money,",3,0,2,3 August 1999
