The Blair Witch Project," Not what I expected, or what I wanted.
","It must be said that I seldom dislike movies (I even enjoyed both Godzilla and Wing Commander, for example), but Blair Witch was a let-down if ever there was one. Yes yes, it's wonderful that the thing was shot in such an original way, but is it too much to expect that the arty types put together a - decent - film,  not just a -unique- one?This movie failed to scare me at all, or even put me slightly off-balance. It just built up and built up... and then stopped. And then the credits rolled. And the audience I was in nearly rioted, with jeers of 'What?' and 'Is that it?'. I'm amazed that people were scared by this film, and shocked that some reviewers are hailing it as 'the scariest film ever made' -- this thing wouldn't even make my short-list for that honor.Don't get me wrong, the premise of the film is super -- your classic urban legend stuff. But this execution was appaling. It -is-  possible to have a scary film where you never see the bad guy, but it seems to me that Witch would've been better off with at least a few flashes of something visually scary -- the dialogue between three characters was too irritating to be suspenseful.All in all, another great idea gone horribly wrong. 4/10.",Null,0,0,10 December 1999
