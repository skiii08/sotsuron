Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Caffeine Free Diet Star Wars
","Let's face it. Star Wars has officially became a children's film. We true Star Wars fans have to suffer because there are a few eight-year-old brats in the audience. Where do I start. Jar Jar Binks, just a scam to get kids under the age of five to watch the movie. He doesn't add really anything to the movie accept stupidity. And Anikan, Lucas had to go and make the future Dark Lord of the Sith a soccer playing brat. And Suebulba, All they had to do is put a white t-shirt and leather jacket on him, slick his hair back, and put a pack of smokes in his shirt sleeve. That would have made it fine. Obi-Wan being the wise old hermit that he is should have more lines than 'yes master'. The other wise old hermit that we new as Yoda is now a bumbling know-it-all. At least Samuel L. Jackson gave a great portrayal of Mace Windu. Darth Maul should have been seen more than a ten minute lightsaber battle (which was amazing). Qui-Gon is a very wise Jedi but takes up too much of Obi-Wan's screen time. Viceroy Gunray and his partner are (very) bad Chinese imitations. Too many bad guys for one movie. I think the total number of them is five. That's just too many. And how obvious is Lucas making it that Senetor Papatine is going to be the Emporor.This movie is okay but Lucas has gone mad with the CGI. I can understand that he loves being able to use it but almost every other character is computer generated. Back in the Original Trilogy Lucas used real people in very convincing costumes, puppets, stop-motion animation, and models that were all hand built. IF was good then than why couldn't it be good now.THis movie is good but lacks the greatness of the Original Trilogy.",5,1,5,7 July 2010
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," I Have a Bad Feeling About This
","This movie does not get the credit that the first two movies get. It kinda lives in the shadow of the first two. I guess so many people expected so much out of this movie. Technology definitely had come some length from the first movie. The movie still heavily relied on human acting and emotinons, yet still maintained comical seriousness. But there is something about this film that just doesn't live up to the first two.I know a lot of people dislike the Ewoks. I do agree that they take away from the seriousness of the situation. Lucas did not direct this one either. The acting and storyline is still phenomenal and great.All the cast does a great job at portraying the characters. Yoda and Obi-Wan still offer guidance throughout. And Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford are at there best.It definitely is a great Star Wars movie and great way to end the trilogy. But it burns me up so much to see that Lucas has went back and 'added' CGI effects to the original trilogy. It ruined the prequels. I guess Lucas was just not satisfied with them. The original three could not get much better. And it makes me so mad to see Hayden Christianson at the end of this film replacing Sebastion Shaw as the ghost of Anikan Skywalker. I hated seeing him in the prequels. Lucas just wants more money I guess.",8,0,1,4 July 2010
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Finally Lucas Has Done Something to Match the Success of the Original Trilogy
","I went and saw this on opening day thinking this was going to be the end to it all. It was going tho complete the saga. It did. But the problem is, Lucas held back so much with the previous two movies so that this one could deliver the goods. This movie is definitely up to par with the Original Trilogy, but it has some flaws. The only bad acting comes from Hayden Christianson, who plays Anikan. The rest of the cast is phenomenal. Another thing is that George Lucas has went a little overboard with the CGI. I have to admit that this movie actually used a lot less CGI than Episode II. Mabey George learned his lesson from the box office blunder of Episode II. But still there is still too much of it. Almost everything was sot in front of a green-screen. But at least the CGI is realistic looking in this film, unlike Attack of the Clones. But this movie has the greatness and originality of the Original Trilogy. I know people give a lot of crap about this film. But it delivered the Star Wars gold standard. At least there was no Jar Jar. If you want to dump your crap on a Star Wars movie, do it to Episode II: Attack of the Clones.",8,3,5,21 May 2010
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," May The Force Be With You. Always
","There really is no way to describe this movie. It changed everything in film after it. It is one of the top grossing films in history. But what made the movie so great? It was the fantasy. It gave people hope when there was little hope left. It recaptured people's imagination. When it came out in May 1977 America was in bad shape. The Vietnam War had just ended which took 58,000 young mens' lives. President Nixion had let the country down. And the hippie movement had swept the country. Then a low-budget movie called Star Wars comes and takes America to a galaxy far, far away.The story is powerful. It tells the story of young farm-boy Luke Skywalker's journey to heroism, but along the runs into quirky characters and mishaps. It truly tells the hero's journey from pion to victorian.The characters all have there place. Mark Hamill truly delivers the role of Luke Skywalker. Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford played their characters of Princess Leigh and Han Solo very well. Princess Leigh broke that princess stereotype that many people knew and Han Solo is the rough-and-tumble space cowboy that you love to hate. And Peter Mayhew defiantly captures the feat of playing Han Solo's wookiee co-pilot Chewbaca. And the best of all is Sir Alec Guiness's portrayal of Jedi Master Obi Wan Kenobi. His elegance and sophistication. And who could forget James Earl Johnes and David Prowse as Darth Vader. And C-3PO and R2-D2 and comical relief to the situation.And John Williams couldn't have done a better score. It adds excitement and enchantment to the story.And the Special Effects is there to compliment the story. It was truly futuristic and amazing for its time.Finally the story reminds us that there is Good and Evil and Evil has to be defeated. And Good shall conquer!",10,1,1,2 July 2010
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Do or Do Not. There is No Try
","This movie took the the first movie and amplified it by ten times. The budget was bigger. The actors where better. The Special Effects were better. And the fan base was established. George Lucas did not direct this one. Maybe that's what made it good. Some one else had delivered his message.The addition of Yoda is phenomenal. Frank Oz delivers his finest as the puppeteer and voice of Yoda. The seriousness and humor is well balanced in him. The way he speaks and the way he does things makes him appear so much more wiser than Obi-Wan. Then Sir Alec Guiness delivers again as Obi-Wan Kenobi. The rest of the cast is also great, especially Billy Dee Williams as Lando Callrisian.This movie is possibly the best of the saga. It definitely is a competitor.",10,0,1,4 July 2010
