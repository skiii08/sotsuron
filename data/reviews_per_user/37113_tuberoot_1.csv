The Perks of Being a Wallflower," I have a new Favorite Movie to add to my List.
","I wasn't sure if I should write a review on this movie, 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' because it hit me so deep. I lived through this movie long before I watched it.This movie brought me so many emotions as I watched Charlie (Logan Lerman) walk with his head down and being / feeling alone, walking through school without a friend, expecting the same every day. But don't get me wrong, this movie was showing people how I felt. As I watched the movie I was reminiscing, as if I was watching myself trudge through school, there were the lights who noticed Charlie, Sam (Emma Watson) and Patric (Ezra Miller), who brought acceptance and fun into Charlie's life and to the movie as well.This movie never leaves a real sort of feel to what life is for Charlie, without making it seem forever depressing, or unrealistically silly. The conversations they have are all likely. The fight in the school cafeteria probable, and I think a person going through so much pain is fighting without fear of harm; the harm is already been done.So watch this movie, if you know a person who is a survivor of child abuse, use your judgment, but it might be a very good thing for them to see this movie, especially if they were friendless in school. There is a really sad part when Charlie hates the intimate relationship he is in, and the breakup is a sudden shocking experience, and all his friends turn away from him. I still think they shouldn't have done that to Charlie, but they didn't understand what he was going through. I saw the scene as acceptable for a movie, but perhaps someone will see the possible damage they had the power to harm a person such as Charlie with, and take that scene as a cautionary tale. Charlie and people like him, are very likely to hate themselves to death in such a predicament.",10,0,2,3 July 2016
