Moneyball," It Doesn't Mean A Thing If You Don't Win the Last Game
","I have been a Dodger fan since I was five years old. And I have the emotional scars to prove it. And because I'm a fan of baseball I've seen a ton of baseball related movies, everything from 'Fear Strikes Out' and 'The Stratton Story' to 'Bull Durham' and 'The Natural'. Moneyball is right there with the very best of them. But Moneyball really isn't about baseball; rather, it is about business. The film uses baseball as a parable, much like Peter Brand, marvelously played by Jonah Hill, uses a video of a player who doesn't know that he has hit a home run to make a point for the Oakland A's general manager, Billy Beane, portrayed, in case you haven't heard, by Brad Pitt. The fThe film skillfully and poignantly demonstrates that, in business, if something doesn't work, you should try something else. And then tweak that something else until you get it right. And don't be afraid to challenge prevailing thought. In fact, this film encourages everyone to challenge the status quo and business as usual concepts on a regular basis. And it does so with an exclamation point. It also makes clear that you have to have a standard by which to judge your success. In Moneyball, Beane states that if the A's don't win the last game of the season, meaning the world series, then anything else they accomplish is meaningless.Moneyball's storyline is simple enough. The Oakland Athletics lose three key players. The team subsequently has a lot of holes in its lineup and little money to fill them. Brand convinces Beane that he can get better players at rock bottom prices by properly analyzing the right statistics. No other team in the sport had ever engaged in such analysis. Beane ends up challenging over a hundred years of 'sound' baseball scouting practices that consist primarily of instincts and gut feelings. All of the performances in the film are extremely believable. Brad Pitt, gives a quietly effective performance. I admit that the first time I saw Jonah Hill in this movie I laughed. I mean you can't help it if you have seen him in 'Knocked Up', 'Super Bad', or the '40 Year Old Virgin'. But I shouldn't have because I saw him in 'Cyrus' and was impressed by his non-comedic performance in it. In Moneyball he does a commendable; but as it turns out, not an Academy Award winning job of playing a computer nerd who, in his first ever job, implements theories he discovered as a undergraduate student at Yale.Phillip Seymour Hoffman, as usual, is excellent as manager Art Howe. Has Hoffman ever not been stellar? Even in a movie like 'Along Comes Pollly' he was effective. You would think that he would no longer accept supporting roles. But, to his credit, he did. And Moneyball is better for it.The A's don't win a world series with Beane as its general manager. But the Boston Red Sox, using the business model Beane developed, do two years later.As a die-hard Dodger fan, I hope the people who make personnel decisions for the Dodgers have spent the money to see Moneyball. But knowing its soon to be ex-owner (I hope), Frank McCourt, I doubt it.",8,0,1,3 March 2012
Pirate Radio," More Like A Ship of Fools
","Pirate Radio refers to a ship at sea that plays banned rock and roll on British airways. The iconic-like DJ's who play the music are presumably the facilitators of the music's social significance and relevance. But I don't see them that way, not as they are presented in the movie. Rather, I see one of them as a rape suspect who induces an 18 year old virgin to have sex via false pretense, another as an irresponsible sex-about who failed to live up to parental responsibilities, and another who thinks having 'just a little pop' with another DJ's wife of 17 hours is as harmless as hitting on a marijuana cigarette. Don't get me wrong. I don't expect rock and roll DJ's to qualify for sainthood. Nor do I want them to. But I don't want them to be the very argument for why rock and roll is evil when, in fact, rock and roll is a legitimate culture and lifestyle.That said, Pirate Radio does have its entertaining moments. It just didn't have enough of them for me to be enamored by the film. I love Bill Nighy's acting talents. Here is an actor that played, with equal effectiveness, a Nazi general in Valkerie, and a drug crazed, over the hill rock and roller in Love, Actually. As a the boss of the crew is equally adroit. Chris O'Dowd, who would later be one of the many highlights of Bridesmaids, does a great job in his role as the victim of the 17 hour marriage. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is actually quite brilliant, as usual, in playing an American celebrity DJ who finds his inner place aboard, above, and below Pirate Radio. My personal fantasy woman, Emma Thompson, has an effective couple of scenes in the film. In fact, the entire cast does a good job of acting.The question, though, is acting as what? A bunch of felons? The movie certainly starts well in defining what I think is the film's central theme. Nighy's character states emphatically, 'Government's loathe people being free.' Juxtapose that quote with the line from Kenneth Branagh's character, a government minister set on destroying the Pirate Radio, 'You see, that's the whole point of being the government. If you don't like something you simply make up a new law that makes it illegal.' So, I thought, we were going to be a witness to a battle between free thought and social will.Instead we got free will run riot.",6,2,3,10 February 2012
Hugo," Martin Scorsese Scores
","When I think of Martin Scorsese I think of violence, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and a ton of profanity. I think of brilliant films about gangsters and one about a psychotic taxi driver. But now I think about Hugo, Martin Scorsese's latest directorial effort. In fact, I think about Hugo a lot. It is a brilliant film. Not perfect, but brilliant.Hugo is brilliant on a multitude of levels: as a fable, as an interpretation of film history, as a venue for stellar acting performances, as a triumph of cinematic photography which involves 3D imagery, and as a vehicle for wondrous entertainment. That Hugo is directed by the same guy who directed films in which two men are savagely beaten by men with baseball bats and then buried still barely alive, a boxing ring's ropes drip the blood of a combatant, a taxi driver becomes a revered mass murderer, and a police captain is thrown off a roof, is testament to the genius that is Martin Scorsese.The story involves an orphaned waif named Hugo Cabret (played tenderly and effectively by Asa Butterfield) who steals to survive and lives among the gears and levers of the enormous clocks in a train station. His life is tormented by the owner of a toy shop ( Ben Kingsley at his best) in the train station and his freedom is in jeopardy due to the efforts of a weirdly pathetic police officer, played by Sasha Baron Cohen (who was the 'hero' of Borat). Hugo dedicates enormous effort to repairing an automaton his father (played briefly by Jude Law) found in disrepair at a museum. During the course of his travails, Hugo meets a young lady named Isabelle (touchingly brought to life by Chloe Grace Moretz) who is the same age as he is. Turns out that Isabelle is cared for by the toy shop owner. And it also turns out that the toy shop owner is Georges Melies, the onetime director and star of some of the first movies ever made. Melies, in case you don't know, is a real person who did in fact transform movies into the medium we now know. The film also accurately references the Lumiere brothers and their camera. The skills with which fantasy is weaved with fact alone compels watching this film.In the film, and in fact, when Melies' success fades, partly out of depression and partly in need of money, he melts his films for the cellulose he can sell. Largely as a result of Hugo's efforts to repair the automaton, Melies stature is dramatically and appropriately resurrected. As I said, the film isn't perfect. The police officer who harasses Hugo is played competently enough by Cohen, but the character just doesn't fit into the film's contextual essence or tone. Picture Gilligan taking the place of Ugarte in Casablanca and you get my point. Visually, Hugo is a miracle; its cinematic imagery, nuanced by 3D technology, merits a thunderous standing ovation. The film's cinematographer, Robert Richardson, has helped fashion a film that has set new standards to be emulated for years to come.I recently read that Martin Scorsese obsesses over every detail, no matter how minute, of every facet of his films. Annoying as that trait may be to those who work with him to make a movie, it has resulted in sustained artistic excellence spanning more than four decades. Any list of the best directors ever inevitably includes Martin Scorsese. Consider just some of his films, Casino, The Departed, Good Fellas, Taxi Driver, The Last Waltz, Raging Bull, Gangs of New York, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, and you understand why.As for all time great films, add Hugo to the list.",8,3,5,2 January 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Why I Am In Love with The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo
","I love the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. I've read all three of the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo novels, seen all three Swedish films twice, and have recently seen the American version of the first film. I understand that the two American sequels are well on their way. I'll see them as well. All of the films are excellent, and I enjoyed them thoroughly.There has already been a ton of discussion about the films' merits, defects, perspectives, intensity, violence, etc. I don't think I could add any meaningful insight to what has already been written. So, I will do what I do best and not even try.With the exception of my second ex-wife, I like women. I enjoy being around them. Despite my two divorces, I prefer long term relationships, although I do fantasize about 20 year sexpots. Those fantasies are laughable considering my three heart attacks, but I have them nonetheless. I say this just so you know where I'm coming from in terms of women.I have always found women who think on their own very attractive. There is no question that the character, Lisbeth Salander, thinks, speaks, and more often doesn't speak, without reservation. Because I would like this essay to be published, I won't repeat the wording of one of her t-shirts in the American version of the film. Suffice it to say it uses the f-word a lot. That's how she is, take it or leave it.As you have probably heard or read by now, Lisbeth suffers a particularly grotesque rape. She is indeed a victim, but she is not victimized. She gets even, simply. My God, does she get even. But her revenge is so straight forward and business-like that she would make Michael Corleone proud. She does not expend much energy feeling sorry for herself, even though she is more than justified to do so, considering what she endured.Indeed, to paraphrase William Faulkner, Lisbeth Salander does not merely endure, she prevails. Her life is ultimately better emotionally and financially after her rape than before it as a direct result of what she elects to do. Her revenge is well designed, well planned, and brilliantly executed. And as you will see in the future movies, Lisbeth is not at all selfish for whom she seeks revenge. And yet Lisbeth doesn't gloat. Or complain. Rather, she is and she does. Period. I wish I could be like that. Take a look at what she does when she is attacked by some street thugs. They sure won't attack her anymore. And, after a fleeting moment of angst because her beloved computer is ruined in the violent assault, she immediately get back on track and does what she has to do to get a new computer.Lisbeth Salander is courageous. Consider what she does in Martin's basement when she rescues Michael (Blomqvist, not Corleone.) I also very much appreciate what she didn't do when Martin crashed his SUV. And she certainly isn't afraid to initiate sex, as evidenced by what she does with Michael and with Miriam Wu.There is no question that Lisbeth is intelligent. In fact, she is a genius. She analyzes as well as processes information instantly. It's one thing to have a photographic memory, which Ms. Salander clearly has. It's quite another to be able to decipher, collate and correlate information precisely, and that is exactly what this young woman can and does do. She is extremely organized in a disheveled sort of way. As anti-social as Lisbeth appears to be (but really isn't, in my opinion), she is loyal to those she loves. Consider her relationship with her original guardian, Palmgren, or her mother, or for that matter, Michael. Incidentally, I've read that the character Lisbeth Salander is based on what the novels' author, Stieg Larrson, thought an adult Pippi Longstocking would be like. For all these reasons I love Lisbeth Salander.Plus she looks great in black.",8,2,6,6 January 2012
The Lives of Others," Heartlessness Can Be So Heartbreaking
","East Germany. Secret Police. Spies. Surveillance. Not the things you would normally associate with love, requited or otherwise. Yet The Lives of Others features all of these things, and more, and does so softly, harshly, suggestively, and profoundly. It is a brilliant film that certainly deserved the Academy Award it won in 2007 for best Foreign Film. Ulrich Muhe plays a humorless, loveless East German secret police operative, Hauptman Wiesler, directed to spy on a noted playwright, Georg Dreyman, played by Sebastian Koch. Dreyman seems to be unwavering in his loyalty to his country and its socialist system of government. Dreyman lives with his talented and revered actress girlfriend, Christa- Maria Sieland, brilliantly inhabited by Martina Gedeck. Ms. Sieland stars in Dreyman's most recent play. The drama is well received by all, including the members of the government hierarchy and bureaucracy. Nevertheless it is decided by the highest levels of the secret police, known as the Stasi, that it would be best if Wiesler overheard everything that is said, done, and most importantly, thought, inside Dreyman's home.Because he has no personal life whatsoever, Wiesler is adept on spying on those that do. Because of his work lovers can't love, purists can be pure, and thoughts are never private. Wiesler exists so that his superiors can exist, indeed prevail. And, as a result, freedoms are lost and lives simply vanish.Muhe's silent, subtle, evocative performance clarifies Wiesler's personal torment and conflict. It is an indelible performance that depicts the disciplined restraint required of a non-life dedicated to infringement and intrusion. But for me, it is Gedeck's haunting performance that crystallizes this film. Her demons are those of her country's; her conflicts are the conflicts of the society in which she lives She is vulnerable in the way a soul searches for its essence in a world that does not seem to have one. All of the performances in this film are strong and convincing. Even minor characters have a significant in the film. There is the young boy who asks Muhe if he really is the bad man that the boy's father says he is. There is the lowly lieutenant whose untimely joke at the expense of the government momentarily causes him to believe that his career is suddenly over. If Koch's performance as Dreyman is the least memorable, it is because his role serves to provide the experiential expanse for the film's other characters to impress their elements. Every character is carefully crafted and expertly delivered.Wiesler ultimately challenges the very authority he embodied, acts upon a love he never had, and gravitates towards freedoms he never possessed. Tragically, Sieland's personal legacy is the exact opposite; she surrenders to an authority she never accepted, flees a love she embraced, and casts aside the freedoms she craved.I will indeed contemplate this outstanding film often. And when I do, I hope my inner most private thoughts stay private.",9,1,1,19 February 2012
Pulp Fiction," What Is Crazy Anyway?
","There isn't a single normal person in Pulp Fiction. Not a one. And that is what makes the film so memorable. There a ton of things going on, including a bizarre couple robbing a diner, a couple of hit men avenging a rip off of a mobster boss, a boxer who is supposed to take a dive but doesn't, and a mobster's wife being entertained by one of the hit men.I admit it. I saw Pulp Fiction for the first time a couple of nights ago. Why it took me 17 years to see this very special movie is known only to God. To think I could have spent all these years seeing this movie countless times, like I do The Godfather, Casino, GoodFellas, and Love Actually is a bit disappointing. But at least I've seen it now, and now I understand what all the fuss has been all these years.John Travolta made his comeback with his performance as one of the loopy hit men, and deservedly so. He is off kilter enough to be interesting but not so extreme as to be insane. He just kills in his worldly sort of way. Samuel L. Jackson, a killer who obsesses about sin and absolution, is his partner. Uma Thurman is the mobster's wife who Travolta's character is supposed to entertain. Take a look at Steve Buscemi as their waiter. Directed brilliantly by Quentin Tarantino, all of the performances are memorable. The list of stars who shine in this movie are as endless as the subplots that they play in; Ms. Thurman, Messers Travolta and Jackson, Bruce Willis, Christopher Walken, Ving Rhames, Eric Stoltz, and Harvey Keitel. Keitel's ability to play twisted in such a straight sort of way is astonishing.The dialog in this film is classic, as I was warned it would be. I was enthralled with the well crafted dialog that comes out of the actors so seemingly effortlessly, and with such entertaining effect.Everyone who sees this film will interpret its meaning differently, especially the ending. As for me, I will never use the bathroom when I am supposed to be knocking off a double crossing boxer.And remember, 'Just because you are a character doesn't mean you have character.'",8,2,5,24 January 2012
