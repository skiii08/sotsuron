"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Budget Barbie Camper
","There aren't a lot of movies that are more fun than this one, and the astonishing thing is that it's (loosely, to be sure) fact-based. No doubt it's destined to become a midnight movie in the not-too-distant future.Yes, it is far superior to 'To Wong Foo...', but keep in mind that Priscilla wasn't made for American tastes (well, not the tastes of most Americans).
Don't Bob and Bernadette make a nice, older couple? BTW, the woman wasn't just Tick's 'partner' (you make it sound like a business arrangement)--they was hitched.",Null,1,3,19 March 2002
10 Things I Hate About You," Just enjoy it.
","One of the best Shakespeare-inspired shows I've seen in a while (the other was also based on The Taming of the Shrew--Atomic Shakespeare on Moonlighting; but I digress).Heck, I'm 37 and I've enjoyed 10 Things...every time I've seen it. From the interplay between the kids to the guidance counselor (Allison Janney from West Wing) trying to write her smutty novel, and--especially--Patrick (Heath Ledger) in the detention room, it's all fun.",Null,0,0,1 April 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Just plain WOW!
",I didn't even know that LOTR was in production until I saw the trailer before 'Harry Potter and the Total Waste of Time.' My chin hit the floor (not a pleasant experience). It was wonderful. I'm pleased to say that I was not disappointed.,Null,0,0,14 March 2002
Army of Darkness," Shop smart, Shop S-Mart!
","This is my favorite Bruce Campbell movie, and probably the best of the Evil Dead series. Beware, though, if you watch this on the so-called SciFi channel. They do some really strange censorship. In the scene that ends 'good, bad, I'm the guy with the gun', when bad Ash says 'you're good Ash, I'm bad Ash,' the word Ash is bleeped out.",Null,1,1,17 March 2002
The Producers," I am hysterical and I'm wet
","(That doesn't sound so good, does it.)You've got to hand it to Mel Brooks--he started at the top and worked his way up from there. Unquestionably his best work.This is not a movie for those whose sensibilities are easily offended, and that's exactly what I love about The Producers. I recently had the opportunity to see it on the big screen, and it was fantastic.As far as casting is concerned, he could not have done better. Dick Shawn was the only possible choice to be LSD, and his Hitler was terrific. (I liebe ya, baby, I liebe ya, now liebe me alone.) Kenneth Mars as Liebkind--great.",Null,0,1,20 March 2002
