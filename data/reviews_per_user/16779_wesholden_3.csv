Sucker Punch," Misunderstood
","While I feel most wrote this movie off as some kind of fantasy romp with a confusing plot i think the point was missed. It's a deep psychological film about coping, defense mechanisms, and alternate realities. It's open to many interpretations I suppose but I think babydoll is just a piece of sweet lea's imagination my hat she uses to help her cope and escape from the asylum. Sweet pea and baby doll are the same person and the fantasy situations they use In order to escape are due to the therapy dr dorksi implements allowing them to 'control their own worlds'. In these worlds they are warriors instead of victims and attain their means to escape. Honestly I thought it was a great movie and bonus points for a sick soundtrack and originality",10,6,8,27 February 2020

Jojo Rabbit," Surprising
","A well written, interesting roller coaster ride of comedy and emotion. One of the more enjoyable movies I have seen but also with characters in depth enough that you care about. A great movie throughout",9,0,0,24 February 2020
