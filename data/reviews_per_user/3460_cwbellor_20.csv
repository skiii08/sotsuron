Gremlins," Christmas turns into Halloween.
","Gremlins has a simple message for American suburbanites. Christmas is cute and cuddly until you get water on it! And if you feed it after midnight, Christmas turns into Halloween. As you sit down to watch this classic film, you immediately know that something bad is going to happen when a big dumb white guy shows up in Chinatown. Peltzer is a putz who sells gizmos, hence when he stumbles onto the furry ball of fun that is a Mogwai, he sees it fit to classify it as another little doohickey that does more harm than good. And therein lies your theme. Gremlins is essentially about man vs. nature and when nature is done destroying technology, it goes after the man and it strikes him right where he lives ...at the bar and the department store. Putzler brings Giz home to his son Billy who immediately gets to breaking all the rules. When Gizmo gets wet, he gives birth to a mischievous group of Mogsters, among them, Stripe. Stripe is a sadistic stalwart who rules over the quartet of Moggies and immediately makes it known to Gizmo that he rejects any familial obligation. Whether Gizmo qualifies as Stripe's father or brother is not quite clear. Billy decides that it's a good idea to give one of Gizmo's siblings to a science teacher so he can poke it, prod it and keep it locked in a cage. Time to break another rule as Billy feeds the Moggles after midnight. After that, Xmas trees attack, a Gremlin goes goo in the microwave and it's a grim grempocalypse for Kingston Falls. The Gremlins multiply and once they get tired of reeking merry mayhem and turning electric chairlifts into catapults, it's off to the cinema to sing along to Snow White. Unfortunately, Billy and girlfriend Kate decide they're gonna poop on the party and ruin the movie (the Snow White movie). Can't give away anymore. Watch it! Love it! Follow the rules!",8,0,1,7 May 2013
Minority Report," No retort for Minority Report!
","Minority Report is evidence that Spielberg kouldn't quite kick the Kubrickian phase after making Artificial Intelligence. But this time, he's traded in the cute little robot for suspense, jet packs and braintwister plot twists. In the future, crime can be predicted, projected and detected thanks to a handful of strong silent types who have arguably the hardest job of anyone in the world. They have to sit in a bathtup all day. These pruney 'precogs' are the reason why Tom Cruise can kick so much ass before that ass even has a chance to kill. It's true you might be scratching your head a little. You might be wondering if these precog pool people have a right to leave their bathtub. You might be wondering why are they in a bathtub. You might also wonder why there are still old fashioned garbage shoots in a future that's so high- tech, we can see the swirly thoughts of precogs on a video screen. But don't worry! The action and suspense in this film are as plentiful as product placements. Let's see... there's Pepsi, Aquafina, Reebok, Nokia, Gap. There may even be a subliminal ad for hemroid cream. Minority Report isn't just a moody, neo-noir thriller either. There's a bit of slapstick to be enjoyed too. Witness a blindfolded Tom eating a moldy sandwich after having an eyeball transplant. The yucks continue as a computer Reports Cruise's eyes as those of a Minority when they are identified as a Japanese man's. Cruise turns in an emotive performance here as we see him break down and crack up more than once or twice. When he's not jumping around or hitching a ride on a jetpacker, he's shedding a tear or two. And man, does Tom know how to finger a computer screen!",9,0,0,26 April 2013
Fight Club," Oh the sweet smell of subversive societal sweat!
","When Fight Club was released ...ahem... bestowed upon a generation so eager to see the lack of meaning in their lives, it felt like a veritable cinematic gift. And who was most eager to receive that gift? Frat boys! Meat heads! Athletic uber-tools! Confused males with no idea what to do with their testosterone or intelects could give a collective and resounding 'I get it!' after declaring that this was their favorite film. And there was nothing wrong with that because this was not a disposable Michael Bay juggernaut of ejaculate. It wasn't even a Tarantino powerhouse of poised pulp! No, this movie was challenging! Unfortunately, as much as society's chode children loved it, they didn't get the message. They didn't get it like the anti-establiSHAM grim and grime enthusiasts got it. You see, there is a truly provocative, truly subversive message to this film that just sweats insight and bleeds truth. That message? Life is not Disneyland, people! Oh no! You thought life was sunny and fun? Get off your Donny Osmond douvee and stop drinking that Yoohoo! Life is a dark, bleak, damp mess and everything that doesn't come from IKEA smells like fecal matter. Fight Club shows us that in this day and age, life is so terminally f***t that finding a support group without a voluptuous obese man is as likely as buying soap that isn't made from human fat. Fat Club ...ahem... Fight Club shows us that in this world, the only truth you'll find is the truth behind a punch to the face ...or the truth between Meat Loaf's mammaries. Never before or since has there been a film that so effectively told us that our lives had no meaning. Except for maybe Twilight! Keep up the good fist, Fight Clubbers!",5,0,1,22 August 2012
World War Z," Zoombies!!!!!!!
","By now, we're all familiar with Zoombies. They're the type of Zombie that runs after you with ferocious fury, as seen in films like 28 Days Later, the Dawn of the Dead remake and most recently, World War Z. Pitt plays a family man and doctor who is handpicked to help save the world from retro rigor morts gone rabid. He joins a team of smart guys on a save-the-world world tour that takes him from the States, to Asia, the Middle East and finally to Europe. The first stop is the East. They arrive in a South Korean airport on a dark stormy night where the only survivors appear to be American. The actors playing the Marines sound like they just played Call of Duty to get a sense of the grunt dialect. Each soldier is endowed with a s***t-happens attitude for good measure. 'God damn it! I'm a Zombie!' Things take a turn for the worse when the genius doctor accompanying Pitt trips, falls and shoots himself with his own gun. Don't laugh! It's not funny! It's tragic! Can you imagine the phone call to that man's wife? 'Ma'am, I'm sorry to say that your husband is dead.' 'Oh no, did he get killed by Zoombies?' 'Umm, no.... he kinda tripped and shot himself.'Then it's a visit to the Holy Land only to find that Zoombies are seriously intolerant of religion. However, the whole undead apocalypse event is convenient for Israelis and Palestinians as they can take a break from killing each other and team up to kill anything that goes zoom in the night. Unfortunately, ethnic harmony makes Zoombies more bloodthirsty than ever. When folks start singing, the harmonious levity attracts the horrible herd and they begin climbing over each other just to make it stop. World War Z is a wonderland of wow-inducing action. You'll find yourself jumping, wincing and possibly even vomiting as limbs are lost and corpses get carnivorous. You may even scratch your head as you watch Matthew Fox provide the most painfully obvious example of a performance lost in editing. Whatever the case, you will love the smell of necronoids in the morning and rejoice in the glorious gore as you enter the Zoombie zone.",8,0,4,30 October 2013
The Terminator," Death metal!
","Kyle Reese is a child of the apocalypse who has been given the chance of a lifetime in a future where the average life expectancy is likely about 30. Reese has been picked by the leader of the sewer soldiers to go back in time to protect the holy mother from an Austrian Android. Unfortunately, it's hard to be emotionally invested in the Reese character because he is so ungrateful. I mean here he is in a time when rat burgers are a thing of the past well, future (Reese's past!)... and all he can do is whine. It's true that having to survive against a mechanical hunk of death metal is a bit of a distraction from the luxury of bottled water, but lighten up Kyle! The cops ask Kyle how he will get back to the future and he gives a sad response of 'I can't.' WTF! Why would you want to go back to a city- sized trash heap crawling with metallic monsters and Hunter Killers? Kyle, go get some sushi, get some plastique, get laid and get to the choppah! Oops, wrong movie!",10,2,3,31 August 2012
Predator," Jumpin' Jocks in a Jungle!!!
","You think your tough, Rambo? Well, loosen that headband because Arnold can do exactly what you can if thrust into the same garish green foliage! And this time, he's going toe to toe with a space-traveling invisilizard. Although he is covered in mud, Arnold shines like an Amazonian diamond in this cinematic masterpiece. He exudes an unparalleled rockin, Reaganormous centeredness as he leads his team of Marine ass-kickers to the choppah. You get the feeling that he could snap a python in half if given the chance. He might have to say, 'snap' as he does it but you get what I'm saying. Predator is the greatest cautionary tale against deforestation by artillery fire you will ever see. Witness the explosion of manimalistic emotion as the marines unleash a ferocious frenzy of bullets against a treacherous treeline. Whether they are doing this to kill a Rastafarian alien or to prepare for a new highway is unclear. But whatever the case, there has never been a more awesome display of ammo ejaculation. The sequence is also revealing of something else. It seems obvious that this Extra-Territorestrial is trying to provoke an inherent jungle insecurity in the egos of the Marines that has been dormant ever since Vietnam. If you listen carefully during the scene where the marines clear cut a patch of the Amazon, you can hear Dillon screaming, 'I got your exit strategy! I got your exit strategy, right here, you Viet Cong cock goblins!' For those who don't know, the three epithets of choice for an American soldier to call a VC were 'dink,' 'gook' and 'cock goblin.'",9,0,1,20 July 2012
Edward Scissorhands," Frankenstein meets The Cure in Tim Burton's masterpiece about the social obstacles in front of orphans with prosthetic limbs.
","<ul><li>SPOILERS - Diane Weiss plays Peg, a woman who one day enters a creepy hilltop mansion yelling 'Avon calling'... umm, more like 'woman intruding!' Diane enters a room in bad need of roof repair. That's when we're introduced to Ed, a creepy looking dark dweller with black hair, white skin and scars on his face. But this guy isn't as Emo as he looks. Well, come to think of it, he actually does look kind of depressed. What I mean is, despite the scars on his face, he doesn't cut himself on purpose. Edward is an orphan who has yet to discover the aphrodisiacal quality of ambrosia salad and Diane with her motherly instincts, decides it's time to introduce Ed to mediocre middle classdom. At first, things seem hopeful. Wynona Ryder appears as a bodacious blonde after living under a black cloud in Beetlejuice and becomes Eddie's snow queen if only for a few beautiful seconds. But suburban life ultimately proves difficult for Scissorstein. Peas are less than easy peasy, lemonade is as sour as Anthony Michael Hall's jealousy and the line between happy hair cut and happy ending becomes blurred. He also wets the bed.</li></ul>Ed bares a slight resemblance to that other black haired, white faced man of mystery, especially if you look at the album cover of Bad. While the similarities to Michael Jackson might seem superficial, they are in fact significant for the fact that he experiences a similar plight to that of Jacko's own fall from grace. Society's reaction to Ed will go from adoration and fascination to fear and paranoia faster than you can say poodle do. After initially accepting Ed and his talents, the white bread burbies become weirded out by him. That's when Ed is faced with the question of moonwalking out of Dodge or staying and being the neighborhood hedge/dog groomer. When you sit down to watch this film and you see that it's set in cookie cutter suburbia, you might think this is a warm and fuzzy fable. Then Johnny Depp emerges from the shadows as a leathery lad with a puckery pale face and Robert Smith's hairdo. Naturally, this makes for a more complex tale. And while it may not be warm and fuzzy, it is definitely warm-hearted. Don't be fooled by the sharp fingers, Edward Scissorhands will touch your heart without cutting it.",10,2,4,6 November 2013
Face_Off," Ain't it cool ...to have your face ripped off?
","Sean Archer is a covert anti-terrorism big shot who doesn't fool around. Caster Troy is a terrorist for hire who doesn't fool around either. Wait! Actually he does fool around. In fact, he's the horniest wild-eyed evil-doer you will see in any story whether it be on page or on screen. All the dude needs to do is cup an ass and he has a mangasm. Imagine the Joker lost his make-up and injected himself with Charlie Sheen's tiger blood. Top it off with a Caesar hairdo and the result is a man who is not quite charming or funny but thinks he's both. When Cage trades the Castor character for Archer with Castor face, the mangasms are replaced by sappy uber-emoting. But Cage's performance is a study in subtlety. There's a few nervous breakdowns and a few emotional outbursts but it's all with a measure of restraint. It's a wonder that the other characters don't drown in man tears but it's still remarkably poised. Goons and gunsmiths shoot and miss each other over and over again. But it's okay because they look soooo cool doing it. And a John Woo film wouldn't be Wooey without Woo birds – aka doves, or are they pigeons? Whatever they are, they're Catholic and feel most at home at a coastal church where guns are going off. Prepare to get a ferocious facial of furious fun. This movie will blow your face off!",8,0,1,29 August 2012
Independence Day," Red, white and blue with a funny old Jew!
","Do you like your sci-fi served red, white and blue with a funny old Jew? Well, look no further than the obscure cult hit Independence Day to satisfy your patriotic yet culturally sensitive desire for alien ass- kicking. What can you say about Independence Day? It's like a birthday cake that explodes in your face. You sit there smiling and licking the frosting off your cheeks saying, 'Mmm... cake!' Then you realize that you're covered in frosting and you want to eat something more substantial and nutritious. But that doesn't mean that exploding cakes aren't awesome! Independence Day is the best exploding cake that will ever give you a frosting facial of fun!Bill Pullman plays the president of the world ...ahem... the USA and when he learns that giant round discs are entering Earth's atmosphere, his eyes narrow a bit out of concern but his presidential poise is not shaken. You see, President Personality is just biding his time until he gets to fly a fighter plane and face off against the telepathic cockroaches himself. But the rest of the world goes batspit crazy and the alien invaders waste no time in letting the human race know that their paranoia is quite valid as they proceed to show that they love to blow s*** up. Jeff Bloomingold is here and his job is to wear glasses and say smart stuff. Will Smith is here too and his job is to offer the viewers the kind of wholesome blackness that's just edgy enough for you to go, 'That's what I'm sayin'!' without getting a look of shock from your grandmother. Robert Loggia even has a job here. It's up to him to give a gravelly voiced delivery of all the dire implications of what's going on. Or is that what's going down? If you're a semi-elderly viewer or just a complete square, this is where you are grateful to Will Smith for providing you with some clue as to what's cool. Or is that what's hot? Anyway, for those who thought show-boating couldn't be charming, you might want to witness Will as he evades and ultimately doops an alien aircraft using nothing but puns, a parachute and an eject button. Will Smith's trash-talking will have you basking in redemptive glory after having lost his best friend mere seconds earlier. It's for this reason that you can forgive the rehashing of all too familiar Star Wars ace pilot jargon that occurs in the same action sequence. A pilot yells, 'There's too many of 'em' while another yells 'I can't shake him! I can't shake him.' Equally forgivable is Smith giving references to two other alien movies within ten minutes of screen time. The only thing that could make this movie more awesome is if Brenden Fraser rode in on a horse and said, 'Let's roll!' Enjoy the cake and savor that frosting!",8,0,0,14 September 2012
The Princess Bride," Buttercumperdink
","Prince Humperdink is intent on marrying his Princess Buttercup. And if you are fortunate enough to be named Prince Humperdink, then you know that there is little in this world that is more exciting than being referred to by the public as Buttercumperdink. But one thing stands in the way of the Prince humping Buttercup's dink ...true love. And little does the Prince know that death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while. And if the farmboy after your bride is wearing a Zorro costume, then you really have no chance of stopping true love. Not even rodents of unusual size can stop true love! Quick sand? Flame spurts? Butt-ugly old crones with a penchant for heckling at public weddings? Think again! And true love has a lot of assistance in the form of a few quirky characters. We've got a French wrestler with marbles in his mouth and a Spaniard with daddy issues who knows how to swash and buckle.",8,1,3,26 July 2012
Black Hawk Down," Who's who?
","In 1993, Somalia was a sandstorm of slaughter and sadness. If you were an American soldier, the worst place you could be was in The Mog! And when the entire impoverished population of Mogashootchyoo is out to get you, you gotta hunker down, watch your six and wait for the guys in charge to green light a rescue convoy. While the bullets fly, see if you can figure out who's who and who's where. You will definitely be catching a bit of don't-I-know-that-guy? Black Hawk Down is a veritable who's who of young Hollywood. You'll notice Obi-Wan Kenobi making coffee right away. But did you know the Incredible Hulk makes an appearance in this as a redneck Delta operative with a taste for wild bacon? Not only that, but elasti-guy from Fantastic 4 has a seizure. Legolas has buzzed his silky hair off and that's him falling out of a helicopter. Even the latest Batman villain Bane has a role as a skinny guy named Twombly. Watch it again and you'll spot the Latin guy from Without a Trace, the British A-hole from The Patriot, Spud from Trainspotting, the crazy Irish drifter from Waterworld and best of all, Tom Seriously Sane Sizemore!",8,0,1,31 August 2012
The Fly," Yummy!
","The Fly is a testament to the power of film ...to induce vomit fits. Are you trying to lose weight? Well, here's what you do, take your favorite guilty pleasure food â€“ cheeseburgers for example, and eat three of them during the last half of this film. If you find that you're still not grossed out by cheeseburgers when the credits roll, just imagine Jeff Goldbum vomiting white goo onto them before you take a bite. NO, no, no... better yet, imagine Geena Davis giving birth to a cheeseburger that wiggles in the doctor's hands. Is it working? You can do it with anything. Try nachos! Brundle Bug is a genius scientist who has been inspired by Scottie to create his own beam-me-up machine. Lucky for Brundy, chicks dig teleporting and it seems like he's got everything a guy could want, a girl, a revolutionary invention and superhuman strength. Unfortunately, that last attribute has some pretty disgusting implications. Did I mention how gross this movie is? Hold on to your fingernails!",7,0,2,31 August 2012
Rocky," Rocky will touch your heart with one punch!
","In the 1970s, a film had to emerge to squash all the Italian American stereotypes perpetuated by The Godfather. Instead of murdering criminals, we get a much more dignified depiction of this ethnic group in the slow-minded, loan shark enforcer who looks like he probably smells. Rocky is a simple, lovable, and soon to be heroic type who only has two talents – ice skating with no ice skates and boxing. When cheerful champ, Apollo Creed seeks to stroke his ego by stroking an amateur boxer across the face, Rocky is the one with the lucky number. Apollo is appropriately named considering that his ego is certainly of God-like proportions.Burgess Meredith plays the gravely-voiced, gnome-like trainer, Mickey. This is a guy who looks like he would shank you sooner than thank you after you toss him a towel. But over all, he's got sort of a fatherly, Gandalfy vibe about him. If he had a magic staff, he would most certainly whack you on the head with it after bestowing some wisdom upon you.Rocky falls for the bespectacled pet shop girl Adrian. Adrian may stand out as the one sane person in this story, simply because she is obviously not happy living in a dank-looking, quasi-dilapidated Philadelphia. The love story between these two is a charming tale of what happens when glum meets goon. In one of the movie's classic scenes, Rocky takes out his frustration on a piece of dead animal. Meat packers beware! Your tenderized cuts will be pulverized if you let this guy into the locker. When he's done sparring with his food, you won't know whose blood has been shed, Balboa's or the bovine's. You will not be underwhelmed by this underdog story. Rocky is and forever will be a classic. It's a reminder of a time when films could be heartfelt without being sappy. The character is obviously a lovable dope, but if you're looking for the truth about the human condition, you will find it in Stallone's puppy dog-eyed performance. The fear and desire in those soon-to-be swollen eyes reveal what is ever present in the hearts and minds of us all, the need to be a champion.",Null,0,0,12 November 2013
Army of Darkness," Klaatu, Barada, Nickleback!
","I know that people love this movie but allow me to speak some truth. The truth is that Ash has about as much appeal as reusable toilet paper. Ash is just an ashhole. Yes, I said it! An epic chin and epic appendage does not a hero make. When a girl makes a blanket for him, he doesn't even say thanks. He's a loud-mouthed braggard with a boomstick and he deserves every bit of beating he gets from his mini-me parasites. And btw, there's nothing funny about Badash singing little goody two shoes. But let's talk about the plot. Things take a turn for the worse for Ash when life sucks him back to the medieval era of primitive screwheads who capture him and throw him into a blood-spewing hole of wicked back flippers and growling ghouls. Luckily he and his chainsaw arm make it out alive and the adventure continues. Dare I say the only part of this movie that is truly unmissable is the final battle between the living and the dead. And holy Harryhausen is it a visual feast! You see, long before Viggo, Lego and Dwarf summoned an army of dead to fight Mordor, there was another morbid mass of muertas who had a bone to pick. Bonepipers lead the way and a skeleewag plays a femur flute as the Deadite army close in on the castle. What follows is a mix bag of mayhem that will make you smile. Sit back and let the necromaniacal witch fu wash over you.",8,3,4,31 August 2012
Con Air," Put the bunny back in the box!
","Between an Oscar-winning portrayal of a Vegas drunk and an Oscar nominated performance as a tortured screenwriter, Nicholas Cage decided to let out his inner redneck. Cage plays Cameron Powe, Alabama Ranger and monotonal meatsicle who lugs around with his muscles bursting out of a wife-beater. You have to remind yourself that you are not witnessing a live-action depiction of some lesser known Street Fighter character. Cage finds himself on a plane ride with the cream of the criminal crop. And make no mistake, America's most notable ethnic groups are represented. Of course we have the white lifers with daddy issues, but we also have a Latino serial rapist with enough charm to fill three baggage compartments; a Big Bad Black convict who is incarcerated for ...not sure... being big, bad and black (???); and a stone-faced Native American whose only crime seems to be communicating in grunts. The Jewish counterfeiter and Chinese cyber criminal must've been flying Delta. Throw in a Cyrus The Virus ...and yes, he is viciously viral... and a Hannibal Lector disciple who is – gasp – the moral voice of wisdom in the film and you've got a wham-slam-alabam adventure that will kick you in the balls. And being kicked in the balls never felt so good.",10,0,0,28 June 2013
The Matrix," Woh!
","Are you ready for Morpheus to give ...no... to bestow some truth upon you? Turns out that we're all just slime covered bio-batteries and the ones fortunate enough to be flushed out of their bondage are greeted by their liberators with a ratty old sweater. Once Keanneo is unplugged, he joins the resistance in the war against skynet ...ahem, I mean, the machines! It would appear that the resistance is only a handful of people with names that sound like obscure Transformer characters like Cypher, Switch, Apoc, and Dozer. Unfortunately, Flick, Thumper and Molt had already been taken by A Bug's Life the year before this film came out. And of course, the coolest of all these cool orphans is the leader and existential drug dealer is Morpheus. Contrary to what his name suggests, Morpheus cannot actually morph into a character that doesn't induce your eyes to roll. If any film can make you contemplate the very nature of your existence, it is a slam-bang cinematic video game that is much ado about kung fu. But The Matrix is more than just a sci-fi movie. It is the greatest testament to the inherently hollow nature of our existence and every single ineffective punch delivered to the face of an androidish agent emphasizes that. You see, The Matrix has one thing to say about life and one thing only. Technology owns you! I know! Let that one sink in a bit before reading further about how groundbreaking this movie is.Ready? Okay. Every one-liner is delivered with straight-faced sophistication and bloated philosophical pretense! But that's cool! In fact, therein lies the quality of this film. The Matrix is a megabyting maelstrom of singular moments all collectively screaming at you, THIS IS COOL!!! And if you don't think it's cool, then you just don't get it! Morpheus enunciates every sylable of wisdom he delivers and slow mo is oh so Neo! Plug in and let the Wowchowski brothers treat your eyes to an ambitious amunitious azzkicker of a film.",1,2,5,14 September 2012
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Jek Porkins
","Many would have you believe that Star Wars is about a little blonde pipsqueak who wants to fulfil his dream of becoming a space samurai. Not true! The true heart of this epic saga is the character of Jek Porkins, the portly, ill-fated, X-wing pilot of Red Squadron. For those who have seen Star Wars but have no idea who I'm talking about, Porkins is Red Six. He is a young, ambitious member of the Rebel Alliance whose dreams of kicking ass and taking names were cut tragically short when his T-65 X-wing starfighter was struck by debris, leaving him with several mechanical and computer malfunctions during the assault on the Empire's planet-sized Death Ball. During his moment of technical weakness, Porkins was sucker blasted by enemy turbolaser fire and killed. There have been many jokes at the expense of Jek Porkins' honorable memory. For example, some have said that Jek's X-wing simply couldn't take the weight of his masculine frame, that it simply wasn't realistic. Well, how realistic is it for a retarded sand savage to leave a wimpy farmboy without a crushed skull when he has ...a skull crusher? How realistic is it for a princess to walk out of a giant garbage disposal with her virginal white dress completely unstained? And don't even get me started about target shafts that are only two meters wide.",5,1,7,15 April 2010
Braveheart," Fight for your right to leave the pants at home!
","Mel fights for the right to wear a skirt without being killed by some intolerant Englishman. He's also fighting for the freedom to free-ball under said skirt. Mel plays William Wallace, a warrior who leads a whole army of free-ballers in this beautiful and bloody historical epic. Wallace's ambition would be all well and good were it not for the fact that all is not well in the state of England. King Edward is a trifle bitter when he realizes that his prince son has a longshank for another dude. This throws a phallic wrench into any plans King Ed may have had for an heir. Things really start to go south for northerner Wallace when King Ed shows that he's not so much the king of England as he is the king of douchebaggery when he decides he's going to teach Latin and invoke the law of prima nochte whereupon an English lord can rape any newly married Scottish woman. But King Shank doesn't foresee the consequences of sexually abusing the women of thousands of angry Scots and when Will's wife is tragically executed for going against policy, he is a highlander who will not take the high road. At the battle of Stringaling, the plaid patriot's army is hopelessly outnumbered and what's worse is the English military machine has horsepower! But when the battle commences, it's the Scots who gain the advantage as they show the charging cavs who's really got the long shanks when they pull out their woods and shank 'em off their steeds. The battle proves a vicious victory for the Scots. But unfortunately, it's not all downhill for the highlanders after that. They will have to defend their title as heavyweight champions at the Battle of Falkor if they want to make history. Not only is Braveheart possibly the last historical epic not to rely on CGI, but it set a precedent for manly screaming in film. Do you really think we would have had a movie like 300 were it not for the emotive whaling in this thrilling opus? Braveheart is also significant for being the first film to display director Mel's healthy obsession with gory executions.",10,1,2,29 October 2013
The Runaways," Don't look for the facts. Look for the truth!
","Does this film tell the whole story of the band The Runaways? No! Of course it doesn't. How can a film tell the whole story in one hour and forty minutes? When it comes to any film based on real events, whether it's Gandhi, Braveheart, Ray, etc, people have some very naive expectations concerning accuracy and truth. But any film based on nonfictional material is not a recreation of events. It's a representation of events. You're not watching a story. You're watching a summary. Many would tell you that this is Cherie Currie's summary and therefore a movie about her and not The Runaways. Because that is the case, doubts are aplenty not only about the accuracy but the integrity of this film. If by some miracle, there were four more movies made, each from the perspective of a different Runaway, the accuracy and credibility of each one would be challenged by passionate fans, moviegoers and those who were actually there.What you get with this film is a thoughtful and captivating look into the era. It was a time when rock n' roll was still dangerous and a girl who wanted to play electric had a lot to prove. With Dakota Fanning's portrayal of Cherie Currie, you get a compelling performance where fragility and innocence mixes with angst and anger. Just like that cherry-shaped firecracker, Dakota can appear sweet and harmless. But if she feels the heat, she could easily be the bomb that blows up in your face. Kristen Stewart's portrayal of Joan Jett is a glimpse of iconic individuality in the face of sexist adversity. And when you think the performance might be veering towards one dimensional monotony, you see her start to crack. When an argument in the studio turns destructive and friendships deteriorate, Kristen's Joan betrays a vulnerability that is damn near heart-breaking. Michael Shannon threatens to steal the whole movie as he gives a larger than life portrayal of larger than life producer Kim Fowley. The character represents everything that is exciting, immoral and ultimately detrimental in the world these girls find themselves in. Any film dealing with the familiar rock n' roll archetypes of sex, drugs and losing it all is bound to be at risk of floundering in clichés. These may be apparent, but only the insufferable cynics will let them get in the way of the truth. And this film does tell the truth. When these girls are on stage, the music, mind, body and soul are in perfect alignment. In those moments they are the most familial, the most powerful and they are so beautifully dangerous that nobody can doubt their strength. It is the purest high that they could ever achieve. The problems arise when the music stops. They walk off stage and they have to deal with family, love, friendships and future. The most obvious way to escape it all is to try and recreate the high. For many a rock star, the answer is never far and for Cherie Currie, the answer was only a pill away. But in the end, the only high that matters is the music because the music is what everyone remembers. If you're looking for the truth in this movie, there it is.",10,1,2,28 September 2014
Jurassic Park," Mayhem, Mathmatics and Megasaurus Egos!
","Jurassic Park taught us many things. It taught us that there is nothing scarier than being hunted by a giant wingless bird. It taught us that the T-Rex is a creature of such stealth that it can sneak into a building unnoticed to save the day. But most important of all, we learned from J-Park that the most formidable species to ever exist in this world was the ever adaptive egosaurus. And I'm not talking about prehistoric creatures, I'm talking about modern humanoids. There are three main subspecies that stand out in Jurassic Park. We have Hammond, the Deiasourus who thinks he's a God. There is Malcolm, aka Dr. Chaos, aka the Prophesaurus, who thinks he's the voice of truth and is so full of $#i+, he could probably benefit from an existential enema. And then there's Grant, the Academisaurus who thinks he's the voice of reason and logic. Unfortunately – SPOILERS - all three of these sores survive the carnage and show up for various sequels as well. I guess we're supposed to get some satisfaction out of watching a blood-sucking lawyer get turned into a dino's dinner while he sits on the crapper. Sam Jackson is here too. But unfortunately, you won't hear him say, 'I've had it with these futha muckin' dinosaurs in this futha muckin' park!' No, the man plays it cool here. The plot is as follows: Hammond can't wait to show his dino pets to the world. He seems so giddy at the prospect that you sense he's gonna wet himself if he has to wait a day longer. But before he can have his grand opening, he must endure a lawyerly island evaluation and the unwanted knee grabs of a leathery mathematician. Hammond is a Scot intent on showing his guests a bloody good time. But for all the expense that he hasn't spared, it turns out that JP has a few glitches. But when things go wrong and Hammond's grandkids are almost eaten by a Tee'd off T-Rex, Hammond is careful not to overreact. 'It's just a delay,' he says. What follows is a tyrannical trip through the dino dome as Samuel L. Jackson chain smokes, the sole Jurassic park ranger mopes around like he was rejected for the role of Crocodile Dundee and Laura Dern slaps the $#!t out of a log. And just when you thought the meals on heals were free and clear, it turns out there's no manual override for computer controlled door locks. Don't adjust your rear view mirrors, that object is as awesome as it appears!",10,1,1,26 June 2013
