The Equalizer," The Equalizer
","We went to see the new Denzel Washington movie The Equalizer. I really think he is such a nice man. He has fame, fortune, and looks, but he didn't let it turn him into a jerk. Instead he tries to be a good influence on kids. He doesn't curse in his movies. In this newest movie he asked some guys who were cursing, 'why do you curse so much?' They didn't know how to respond to that. This movie is about him helping some kids get a better life. I like how only the bad guys curse in his movies and you don't see them very much, but he is setting an example to kids who like his movies cursing makes you look like a bad guy. He also encouraged kids to read in this movie. I like the movies he chooses to do. I also like Déjà Vi and Much Ado About Nothing. I'm sure he has others that have just slipped my mind right now, but these three are really nice.",10,6,17,4 October 2014
RED," perfect combination
","I normally wouldn't put in an action adventure movie when I'm home alone without my husband, but I would definitely put this movie in when I'm home alone. It is so funny. It is like they took a screwball romantic comedy and an action adventure comedy that is somehow also serious and perfectly combined them. I love how the young people think it will be a piece of cake to takeout the older ones. It is so fun to root for the 'underdogs.' The opening part just cracks me up, Bruce Willis' life as a bachelor. How anybody could live that boring and own a gun and not shoot themselves in the head is beyond me. It just cracks me up every time. I hope they make more movies like this.",10,0,2,10 May 2014
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Colin Firth wasted on this
","SPOILER ALERT and WARNING They were lobbing f-bombs at you on par with the quantity in the Die Hard movies. They used the 'bait and switch' method of advertising in their trailer. The trailer would have you believe Colin Firth saved a kid from the streets as in Obi Wan and Luke Skywalker, Agent Kay and Agent Jay, Enders Game, etc. You see that trailer and that is what you are expecting. Then you get in there and a lot more cursing is going on than you expected. Then the last scene in the movie is graphic anal sex. Is this the best you can do after 100 years of cinematography? Crude for the sake of it. The man sitting next to me got up and left shortly before the end of the movie. I thought surely it can't be that much longer, he couldn't wait to go to the rest room. He never came back. I guess he'd been warned about the last scene being so vulgar. I wish I'd read the reviews before I went so I would have left when he did, or not gone at all. I'm so tired of CGI. Newsflash movie makers real people can't fly sideways for 20 feet. I will be finding out who made this movie, and I will be making sure not to try anything else of theirs until it is so old it has been reviewed to within an inch of its life, so I'll know of any vulgarities so I can decide for myself and not have it sprung on me with no warning.",1,27,54,1 March 2015
