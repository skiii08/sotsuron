First Man," American Exceptionalism
","First Man is a compelling, emotional, riveting tale of how America, NASA, and a bunch of what would now be derided as 'privileged white men' created the singular event in human history: a human being on the moon.Neil Armstrong describing to the world, live on television and radio, that his was but one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.I would guess that practically everybody in the world, even now, knows what he said.Most have read of the controversy surrounding the conscious, politically motivated, decision to not show the American flag being planted on the moon by the Canadian (read citizen of the world) Director. But, as we saw this afternoon, there's now a lingering wide view of the LEM resting on the moon's surface with the newly planted American flag clearly in the picture...causing this viewer to wonder if it was newly planted 'post final cut' addition to stem the potential loss of audience the negative reaction that the omission caused?Otherwise, the movie is a rather straight forward, linear telling of how NASA's moon landing came to be: the barely mentioned Mercury program, followed by several two-man, Gemini launches to test the theoretical possibilities of using multiple vehicles requiring in-space rendezvous to make the mission viable with available technology. And, then, the audacious Apollo program which had to invent and test the largest rocket ever constructed to get humans to the moon and safely back...the gigantic, strangely beautiful, instantly recognizable, Saturn.Which had a test launch one night when I was home from college and lit up the Indian Harbour Beach sky like it was a man-made, sun. The rippling, guttural roar of the launch reaching us as the Saturn rose in a new day sky, shaking the windows of my parent's home, and pressing my shirt to my body, twenty miles from the Cape.In its retelling, First Man recounts the drama and tragedy of those years. Incidents now mostly forgotten: A T-38 crash that killed two of the Gemini astronauts during training; the disastrous fire that killed an entire Apollo crew while the capsule was being tested on the launch pad; the first attempt at a space rendezvous causing the Gemini capsule, piloted by Neil Armstrong, to careen out of control, tumbling wildly and dangerously, as the crew fought to stabilize it before they blacked out and the capsule was destroyed. Then, near the end of the movie, the mounting tension and drama played out live on television, as the LEM sought its landing location and not finding it until Neil Armstrong overrode the computers, taking manual control, and landing the LEM with no fuel remaining.Some of this, in First Man, is breathtaking. All of it is riveting.The human story that holds the movie together thankfully doesn't use the normal Hollywood stereotype of a complaining wife and a noble husband attempting to do heroic things. I wish that such unreal, unnatural, uninteresting, and demeaning depictions of women would be forever consigned to the dust heap of Hollywood tripe and a more natural male/female/husband/wife life become common in movies about uncommon people who do great things.Which happily and realistically occurs in First Man.A family tragedy becomes the moving subplot of this powerful recounting of one of the world's most historic events. Yet, even as a subplot, it is not a contrivance, and its emotional impact on the Armstrong's had me verklempt and more accepting of Neil Armstrong's almost off-putting stoicism in the face of all things. And, makes Ryan Gosling's laconic, strong, and silent portrayal convincing. Indeed, at some point in the movie, he becomes Neil Armstrong, something, I would guess, all actors act to achieve.First Man shows the astronauts and their families as human beings. Extraordinary, but recognizable human beings. Men, women and children, all with hopes and fears and frailties. All displaying courage, humanity, skill, and drive. Watching them, I thought of the children and families I grew up around on Army posts around the world. They were like the people in this movie. All of us are. We're Americans.The movie, though directed by a Canadian, and starring a Canadian, despite the kerfuffle about the flag, is a love story about what the meritocracy that is America can do, what humankind is capable of.John Kennedy promised that America would put a man on the moon within the decade.We did it in less than seven years.Fifty years on, it remains a universally shared example of human accomplishment.I watched the second moon landing in a bar in Athens...the Greek crowd cheered, pounded us on our backs in joy, wept and bought us glass after glass of retsina.We drank to America, to Greece, to Mickey Mouse, to John Wayne, to the world.First Man will remind you of those times, and make you hope for more like them.",8,18,42,14 October 2018
Fury," War, and watching 'Fury', is hell.
","It is hard to put into words just how loathsome a movie 'Fury' is. The self hating writer/director must have correctly calculated that any WWII veteran of the European Theater must be in his or her's late eighties by now, thus avoiding the real potential of one of them slapping the living scheisse out of him for this atrocity. It begins with a ridiculous scene, is of the war movie genre that demands German soldiers running upright and without cover toward machine guns so our anti-heroes can mow them down conveniently, and consistently opts for opportunities to shove the new hip narrative that lovingly depicts American soldiers as murderous, war crime committing, raping thugs. See: 'Inglorious Basterds.' Much of it is hard to watch, especially after 'Saving Private Ryan' which set a high bar for any war movie following, the rest is drivel. And, not even good drivel at that. High marks (pardon the pun) though, for the German soldiers surrounding the tank, who stop firing for inexplicable reasons, but which coincide with long discussions on war and friendship by the tank crew.",2,304,498,17 October 2014
Superbad," Not super, not bad, not you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll hurl status.
","I hate to rain on the parade of the 'funniest movie ever' but Superbad wasn't bad, but is not a laugh riot. Some teen age insights amid the top the next one gross sexual joke, but a ridiculous cop buddy Supertroopers laid on American Pie-dom does not a classic make. As a guy I laughed a lot, not the kind of lost it at the movies laughs of a Dumb and Dumber or the building snort by snort belly laughs of The Big Lebowski, and not the continuous tumescence of Animal House. I also wondered what any girl might think of the whole premise of the plot or the grossness of the jokes? There weren't any girls in the audience I sat with, mostly guys in their twenties, some high schoolers, and amid the group there wasn't the universal hysteria the reviews posted seem to suggest. The major paid movie reviewers waxed rhapsodically about this movie but having spent many an afternoon sitting with movie reviewers in various screening rooms, they are blood brothers (and seem the types to giggle over menstrual blood) to Seth, Evan, and Fogel. Seth is given to many adult like rages, Fogel too many moments of unbelievable nerdiness, the cops too many similar scenes of 'just wanting to have fun, for this movie to move the average movie goer or to cause one to get beyond a laugh to a laugh riot. Evan, on the other hand, is allowed to make his character in the movie a real person. More universal, less nerdy or fake aggressive. There was something in his voice, something that we all were in high school that is the best thing in the movie.It must not have been chance but clear thinking that did not include any of the ridiculous cop buddy sub plot in the previews. The cop stuff is like the energizer bunny: it goes on and on and on for increasingly hard to get laughs out of increasingly ludicrous situations.So, six stars out of ten, and not even in the top ten of teenage gross out sex movies or cop buddy movies.",6,7,15,22 August 2007
Juno," We were silent at the end
","I just saw Juno on a cold and dreary day. Theater a third filled, but that third almost all young girls, high school, late middle school, a few early college maybe, no older women, no older men. The movie is about a high school girl who has sex with her dorky boy friend, seduced by a chair she says, and the act is told in flashback as she tries again and again, with the Greek chorus of a convenience store clerk and customer, to make a pregnancy test change from positive to negative through sheer will and repetitive testing.It's one of those movies that touches your heart. With the actors speaking in a vernacular that rings true. Using language hidden from those beyond high school that is so descriptive and so natural that it makes TBHS (those beyond high school) think, for at least a second, beyond inherent cultural and age superiority, that true beings, as true as when they were in high school, actually walk the corridors and unlock lockers and have sex and become jealous and fall in love and make the same dumb mistakes that you made too. Juno the movie and Juno the person have true emotions, and show us real lives rather than the familiar dross of sit com exploitations, MTV reality shows, and adolescent sex comedies which appear with some regularity at our local multiplex.I remember experiencing what mass media said about my generation's life in high school when I was in high school. It wasn't even wrong. It was embarrassing and contemptible. They had no ear, no empathy, nor sympathy for what we thought or felt or were. Stories complete with glossaries of terms and definitions to hip their readership to what was today's teen world. Meretricious, utter crap.High school. Sex and love. Life. Situations requiring emotional understanding beyond one's age group, family, jutting up against adults trying to understand, wondering what is real and if love is real and if love can be forever...such is the stuff of Juno. You can argue, if in a cynical mood, that the language is too hip and too easy to the tongue of the characters, and that Dorothy Parker isn't a knocked up teenager in Minnesota in 2007, that Juno is as fictive as Jupiter's wife, but that would be missing the point of going to the movies.All of these characters are given the opportunity to live on the screen. I watched and wondered, not knowing, how much of this movie was the product of the screenwriter's life and how much of her imagination? It does not really matter, of course, but even asking such a question gives an indication of how good a movie Juno is.In most movies pregnancy and children are props or opportunities for one liners or just in the background. But, this movie isn't like that. In Juno, there are no big messages just the grand and glorious message that life is, that people live it the best they can, and that a good writer and a good director can use that big screen for small moments with big emotions and take the audience with them as Juno and her dad and step mom and best friend and boyfriend and surrogate couple get through nine months of her Junior year and summer.The audience laughed and sighed during the movie and there was a moment of silence as the screen went black as if we all wished Juno would stay around a little longer. Ellen Page, is wonderful, as much of a cynic as Joseph Gordon-Levitt in 'Brick', but like him as in all cynics, a thin protective veneer hiding the open heart of a romantic just below. Like all of us.",8,4,11,31 December 2007
Cloverfield," Life Interrupted
","This may be the first post postmodern film. A MTV inspired style of self-conscious life narrated in real time with a herky-jerky style that becomes a topsy turvy big screen reality. A real time reality not found in traditional movies. Sure, the Blair Witch Project pioneered the style, but Cloverfield, a big movie, a big budget movie, a big story movie, that takes The Real World and makes it an epic movie. Sort of a combination of The Real World's young adult swirling lives, The Amazing Race's group dynamics, and non-professional documentaries found on Youtube. But, in Cloverfield, the ultimate prize isn't money or fame, but survival.With a story that is universal: love and loss. A behind the camera Falstaffian figure telling the story, and the story told entirely in the moment. Despite the shakiness of the camera and the rules of the reality game, a movie with a delicate suppleness showing time suspended through the replay of the discovered disk containing a preexisting real-time love story caught in calmer more innocent times. The camera captures the sensibility of a younger generation in its use of language, raw feelings of young love, and a realism that engages viewers of any age. The shaky camera does become a bit much at times, but a glance or two away from the screen at a static theater chair, or the empty box of popcorn on the theater floor restores the movie viewer's center and eases the stomach.The story is simple enough: a going away party of twenty-something's at a Manhattan apartment have their lives interrupted by an unimagined evil and violence. Told with in a self-indulgent egocentric style of narrative familiar to us all from television. A style that has leapt from the small screen to the big and creates a new effective form of movie making. Off putting at first, the various narratives spoken to the camera keep us up front and close to the action and up to date with their stories, viscerally involved, with the fantastical growing disaster that has torn their comfortable lives and New York to pieces.Interesting movie making, done with incredible art direction, control of crowd scenes, special effects, believable nightmarish monsters, and style. Done in a way that brought all of 9/11 back to me. What it might have been like if a camera had been found in the rubble of the Twin Towers detailing the lives of real people the same age as the characters in Cloverfield with the same hopes and dreams and desire to live long lives as they confront a fate they could not have imagined as they woke up and got ready for the day on that beautiful morning.I am still a bit sea sick and oppressed by what I saw on the screen. I am also incredibly impressed by this post postmodern movie. I remember the story about the long time New York Times movie reviewer panning Bonnie and Clyde. He did not appreciate the new style and stylized violence of the movie. He just didn't get it, and by not getting admitted to the NYT's readers that the times had passed him. He retired shortly after the movie became a hit, his artistic point of view too rigid to admit the brilliance of Arthur Penn's vision.In 2008, after a decade of radically changing media and media content delivery systems, it's idiotic to hold to a rigid view of what constitutes movie art. Digital, high speed downloads, cell phone movies, blogs, iPods, iPhones, electronic books bang bang boom and poof... something new was probably invented whilst I write this. I watch a downloaded mini movie by Martin Scorsese late one night, a take off on Hitchcock for a Spanish champagne, and it is so good I smile in bed like an idiot. I email it to a friend in London and ten minutes later he emails me a video taken with his phone that day of a walk in a park with leaves so golden and red that the video seems hand painted.Cloverfield, a movie as metaphor on many levels: a going away party for a young executive leaving for Japan, the land of Godzilla and Mothra, dependent as metaphor on what your definition of 'going away' is. Cloverfield, first person self conscious narratives with more Oh My Gods than a Catholic mass, a life boat in a stormy sea mounted camera, focus and film quality that would not have been allowed in the Golden Age of Hollywood, and the lives and fates of a group of generation Xers (or is it Yers?) whose lives are suddenly in the grip of a mindless evil, made for this movie lover a new kind of movie, a movie that I would recommend highly.",8,1,4,22 January 2008
Once," The heart has reasons that reason knows nothing about
","I write these for friends and if you love movies you are a friend: I saw a movie last night that was so good that I have spent the last hour looking up information about it on the Internet Movie Data Base and related links. I have included the Fox Searchlight website for the movie at the bottom of this review so you can hear the music. So now I know that is was made in 17 days and at a cost of less than $150K and reflects a Dublin of 10-15 years ago when Dublin was much poorer and more working class.And, I would be much poorer in life and spirit, and my heart, like most of us, covered in scar tissue from life, would not seem so vulnerable and new, if I had not seen this movie. A simple story of a street musician in Ireland, singing covers during the day for Euros, and his own music at night for cents. A verging on middle aged man, still living with his Da, repairing vacuums in a tiny shop and writing songs to his lost love in his tinier bedroom. Approached by girl, an immigrant, who loves his songs, understands the pain that gave them life, and soon they are in a music shop with the girl playing the piano and together they prove that art isn't produced from big budgets or green lit by ten vice presidents and that seventeen days and a pittance can make me get goose bumps just trying to write a review of what I saw in a dark theater with ten other people in a complex dominated by Shrek, Pirates, and Spiderman.I knew a woman once who only read novels about unrequited love. What a wonderful phrase: unrequited love. Archaic, unrequited, love, universally known and unknown, and as a friend said about the movie and its songs: no great art came from happiness. But the movie isn't sad, it's pulsing with life and music and incident and the process of how art is made. I have always been a sucker for movies about how art is made: Shakespeare in Love, Topsy Turvey, as examples, but in both those, art that was known. In Once, on the streets of Dublin, an Irishman and a Czech girl, remind us of how, to my generation, the guitar was king, a guitar, bass, drums and piano a symphony orchestra, and there was no power like the power of rock and roll. In all generations, love sought, found, lost, and sometimes regained is the stuff that brings us to the theater, to the book, to the movie.I'm in the midst of reading a book by an Irishman, a detective novel, the hero a reader, and the author uses the book to list books he likes: from one...'the body moves on, the mind stays and circles the events of the past.' This must be true of the writer/director.You won't forget these people. I can't forget their songs. We should all meet, my movie loving friends, and talk about this movie in a bar in Chicago I know that has great music on the jukebox, cold cold beer, and is dark enough so we would all look good. Neil Young sang: only love can break your heart, Once asks 'how often do you meet the right person', and as fellow movie goers I ask how often can the right movie be made, shown in your local, and break/make you heart at seven of a beautiful summer's eve? It's the best movie of the year. Maybe of the last five years. But, I am not a dispassionate critic, I loved it.",10,561,635,9 June 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," No Brite Smile product placement
","Just back from seeing 'The Bourne Ultimatum.' Which called to mind John Simon's famous quote about Ali McGraw: 'Her emotions ran the gamut from a to b...' If the stars of this movie were paid by facial expressions used during the filming of 'The Bourne Ultimatum,' the producers either paid too much or made the movie for pennies. Matt Damon uses one grimace throughout, in fact all the actors, down to the smallest parts, are only called upon to grimace. When Bourne looks at a picture of his dead girlfriend, a picture in which she is smilinga smile amid the grimly grimaced grimaces, the audience in my theater, after enduring such A to B-dom, spontaneously hugged the persons to their left and right in relief. Rumor has it, that the producers attempted to get a Brite Smile product placement and when they failed, dictated a no smiles policy on screen.The movie seems an homage to '24', with continuous use of technology rather than human interaction, and shouts of 'form a secure perimeter...' between the Run Jason Run plot. Yes, an homage with the same fabled porous perimeters that drive so much of '24' s action. Never in the history of movies have more perimeters been demanded with less effect. It would have been a much more enjoyable movie experience if we all had adopted the 'form a secure perimeter' drinking game of hard core '24'-ers.The story is a succession of chases, done with close ups so close that you wonder more about the actors' pores than their craft. Hmmm, what does Matt Damon use...a mild facial cleanser and an exfoliant? Does he wash his face every night? Dove? Keihl's face cream for men? I sat there and thought: kind of big pores for a movie star and Albert Finney's?..well, it's been a long time since the youthful smoothness of 'Tom Jones.' So we sit and munch our popcorn to the thumping soundtrack, and Jason runs at or away from us for hours, runs away from increasingly ludicrous numbers of CIA operatives sent to kill him and anyone he talks to. Frenetic action with all sorts of film school mannerisms: lots of overhead shots, lots of odd angles through elbows/over shoulders/through distorting glass, grainy film stock, purposeful out of focus shots to put the audience there, in the scene, grim faced and large pored with the actors.And, of course the au courant deep loathing of the Beelzebub CIA, of the United States, the twins of complete immorality, incredibly invasive technology, porous perimeters, legions of mindless minions, tramplers of all human rights, and, always, at the dark heart of it all: conspirators with conspiracies within conspiracies.I don't think I have seen an action movie recently involving anything to do with government that does not have an obligatory water-boarding scene, or hasn't worked 'rendition' into the script. These are now totems to prove the writers/producers/directors bona fides as speaking truth to power and moving the Big Lie along.The ordering of a murder with a small American flag at the murder order-ers elbow is the kind of subtlety used to make sure you know what country lies at the belly of the beast.Not nearly as good a movie as the first two Bournes but, absolutely worth seeing. Go to marvel at the adrenaline rush excitement the Director's skill creates hoping it will form a secure perimeter around plot holes big enough to swallow the Texas School Book Depository and the grassy knoll.Note to fellow action movie lovers: four stars for the number of scenes in which nine millimeters in two handed extended arm sweep rooms, houses, streets, offices. Four stars for honoring the tradition of at least one attractive female lead self dyeing and cutting off her hair with scissors to disguise herself and emerging as a butterfly from a caterpillar with a look that John Edwards pays $400 for.",6,2,5,4 August 2007
21," How to make Las Vegas boring.
","Yes, it does take effort. Listless characters that it would take a saint to care about, turgid plot movements that make watching CSPAN seem an adventure in action movies, and a love interest that rivals the sparks thrown off by Pat and Richard Nixon dancing at a state dinner. I'll sum up how boring the movie makes LV: several scenes in strip clubs with no one naked. Oh, I almost forgot...there was one happening stripper with rose colored star shaped pasties. Pastie bosomed strippers/lap dancers in Las Vegas circa 2008? Not even in Shecky Greene's day.It would be hard to care for these characters even if you were related to the actors. One more howler: card counters from MIT staying under the radar, winning hundreds of thousands from various casinos, but shown in several scenes (I should have counted them) being greeted by name as a high rollers by doormen, casino executives, and dealers. Dull, dumb, and unique in being the worst Vegas movie ever.",3,20,37,30 March 2008
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Ishtar Lives!
","Quite possibly the worst movie of the decade. The only explanation for its production some in the know sick joke on remaking Ishtar and replacing it as number one on anyone's bad movie list. Same major-star buddy plot wandering aimlessly in the desert. Turgid, not funny, not remotely interesting, appealing in a masochistic way in the bad dye jobs worn by aging stars playing young soldiers. Desperation plot devices cobbled into the incoherent script to distract from the awfulness: the always popular among movie critics references to Abu Ghraib, and a lysergic acid subplot that does play as if a bad trip. My audience sat in stunned silence. Not a laugh in the group. What were they thinking?",1,19,41,7 November 2009
Tropic Thunder," A Bull and Cock Story
","I haven't enjoyed a Hollywood within Hollywood movie like this since 'Tristram Shandy, a Cock and Bull Story.' Which I had to see twice just to get all the inside the business jokes. Jokes and asides that flew fast and furious, making it one of the best movies of 2006.'Tropic Thunder' is, without a doubt, one of the best movies of 2008 and might actually be a double double insider Hollywood movie. On the one hand it is just funny and gross and skewers everything and everybody who has ever worked in the 'business.' On the other it's a wonderful homage to Shandy. The humor mined from rival actors/celebrities interactions found in Ben Stiller's Tugg Speedman and Robert Downey Jr.'s Kirk Lazarus mirror that played out in Shandy's Steven Coogan and Rob Brydon as their screen lives and real lives and insecurities made for humor within and without the actual movie movie. Or is that the movie's movie movie? I don't think it was chance that Ben Stiller choose Steven Coogan to play the Director of 'Tropic Thunder.' It was sly genius.Tristram Shandy, A Cock and Bull Story is a about trying to film a movie about an unfilmable book. 'Tropic Thunder' is a movie based on a faked war memoir, unread by the cast, the script unread by the leads, the movie made unfilmable by the actors' rivalries and the Director's incompetence. The Producer is going to pull the plug on the whole shebang until Tristram himself (Coogan) dumps the actors into the jungle to see if they can be all they can be. So the audience and the Director of the Director (Stiller to Coogan) can use for comedic effect the laws of Hollywood celebrity with its cellphones, producers, agents, G5a, and contract riders and the laws of the jungle..Hmm, I hope that this isn't too confusing because the Tristram/Thunder connection makes a great funny movie even funnier.Laughs, belly laughs, imagination, great fun, and up close seats to the Hollywood we think might be the real Hollywood. Cameos, satire, anarchy, totally non linear, totally unexpected situations, not a dull moment, which is the highest praise I can give in a year filled with so many witless boring comedies.Go see it. Go see it twice. I'm betting it's even funnier the second time.By the way, there is a lot of cock talk in the movie...and indeed, one bull.",9,5,11,15 August 2008
The Love Guru," Rabelasian Guru
","Jeeze-louise, the IMDb reviewer cries after reading through the almost universal condemnation of this movie. Did everyone have a bad day the day they saw it? Don't take their ill humor to heart and see this movie. I sat through 'Get Smart' yesterday with a willing grin on my face waiting for a laugh...it wasn't there. What was there is a competent Maxwell Smart saving the world and getting the girl which made its humor earnest not anarchic. The willing grin became a dyspeptic grimace as plot and heroism replaced comedy.That experience made going to 'The Love Guru' potentially an exercise in masochism...here we go again, I thought. A non comedic comedy.And, indeed, a shaky start had me concentrating on counting the number of Peanut M&Ms in the yellow bag I had bought along with a diet coke because I'm counting calories as well. OK, penis jokes, flatulence, a midget, cross eyes...tedious tedium again? Then, twenty minutes in, the sheer exuberance of Mike Myers with rapid fire penis/flatulence/midget/cross eyed jokes, Bollywood dance numbers, love of hockey, love/hate of Canada, use of celebrity to attract celebrities to play roles in this movie overcame all and I went with the comedy.Mike Myers is shameless, who knew? He is over the top, quelle surprise! He is cross cultural and topical in allusion and jokes, what a nightmare!Let him go, accept that it is a Mike Myers film. Let an ashram, sitar, elephant, Oprah, chastity belt, tasteless, adolescent,Deeprak, motorized carpet hockey movie wash over you. Let your inner self be itself, admit that if even every fourth penis joke is actually funny, in a movie with 4.2 million of them that is still a million laughs.",7,7,15,24 June 2008
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Well, it wasn't edited by the 'suits' or greenlit by a committee
","Long, slow, wooden, and dumb, but not unwatchable. Tarantino's creepy fascination with women's naked feet on full display. Makes the viewer wonder if the movie exists to prove the Director's eternal hip-itude as age overtakes, to allow him to play his favorite oldies for the audience, ditto vintage cars, clothes, and hairstyles, rather than any particular story meant to entertain, amuse, or shock. The great reveal is not that revealing, just idiosyncratic and who cares-ish. That said, Brad Pitt continues to be eye candy, is shirtless for ten minutes., DiCaprio starts slow but ends well, and Margot Robbie ethereally beautiful.",4,21,46,27 July 2019
The Mist," Twilight Zone revisited
","I have not read the novella nor have I read a Stephen King book in years. I wondered as I watched this movie whether his serious accident had changed his life view dramatically. Whether the unfairness of his injuries and the random nature of his personal tragedy had changed his view of religion and religious people. Because beyond the mist and its denizens there are monstrous Christians portrayed as murderous fanatics and warped psychopaths used as curious plot devices among the humans trapped and trying to survive.The religious discussions go on and on as if in a reworked 'Lions for Lambs.' We are made to feel as if the irrationality of literal biblical interpretation is somehow more irrational than a plot involving creatures from another dimension with a taste for humans. But, the movie as a movie works as a long familiar Twilight Zone plot...you know: group dynamics in the face of inexplicable events. I kept waiting for the camera to pull back and reveal the entire plot as some evil experiment to determine human breaking points.It isn't really a scary film, more of a tense film. The misty monsters become almost familiar and fill familiar roles right down to living human pupae acting as grotesque hosts of grotesque spidery thingees. But, it is a confusing menagerie of evil insects with no natural order to them...some are like demented wasps, others refugees from prehistoric times, and a few are huge and lurch around making noises and looking like War of the Worlds machines. Some of the acting seemed false to me especially the interaction of father to child and the burgeoning romance between father and the new teacher in town played out while the mother/wife has been lost in the mist.The ending is shocking and is a Frank Darabontian addition rather than King's idea of a proper conclusion. I'll let others determine whether the religious caricatures spring from King's loss of faith during his painful recovery, are a comment on current events, or are as much overkill as the overkill of the ending.Well worth my $6.50 matinée price but I might have felt cheated at premium rates. Seemed totally over the top in its anti religion bias to this agnostic but former altar boy. But, several of Rod Serling's Twilight Zone episodes in reaction to his experiences in combat during WWII were also used to prick the bubble of mindless faith as well. And, we live in times where flesh eating beasts from another dimension can be compared to evangelical Christians to drive box office.",6,1,4,26 November 2007
Crazy Heart," Rent Tender Mercies
","It's hard to criticize any movie with Jeff Bridges in it. Harder still anytime you get a chance to see Robert Duvall on screen, but, it's hard as heck not to walk out of Crazy Heart without thinking: this exact movie has been made before, made better, only starring Robert Duvall. As in Tender Mercies...so good that Duvall won a Best Actor Oscar. I loved Jeff Bridges channeling Waylon Jenning's look and music, but that was about it. Alcoholic country singer, grown child of a former marriage, single woman with a young child, interaction with a young backup band...it's Tender Mercies II, with a bit of Payday thrown in. If you have never heard of Payday, look it up on IMDb, Netflix it and discover one of the great unknown country music movies of all time.",5,19,34,26 December 2009
There Will Be Blood," Paul Thomas Anderson's Inferno
","The Promethean rise of a driven man in a young oil industry gives this movie moments that make it as good any movie seen in a long while. Rise and fall stories are a familiar trope in movies, especially American movies. There Will Be Blood takes a different and strange detour that is not really a fall, but a sudden sidestep into demented isolation.Attached, and ruinous to the movie, is Paul Thomas Anderson's obvious self loathing and loathing for religion in general and Christianity in particular. His pen, used to bludgeon, hammers any joy out of a Chinatown fable about oil, in the service of what seems to be therapy for the Director's personal seventh circle of religious hell. His, a hell hectored to a captive movie audience, who are expected to be entertained by his very personal denial of faith in an otherwise interesting semi-historical story of how little oil became big oil.What begins with a bit of religious weirdness a third of the way into the movie, becomes an ongoing relentless evisceration of all that faith or salvation represents to some people. It is all meat to the Director's abattoir of nihilistic expression of his personal loss of faith. Daniel Day Lewis, worth the price of admission to any movie, dominates every scene despite what many of the improbable scenes in There Will Be Blood require him to do. Filmed in sweating close up to excess, in shadow, or eerily in interrogation room quality bright light, he is alternately sublime and ridiculous. Allowed to be an oilman on the make, he is one of the remarkable movie characters of our time. Pulled this way and that by a tortured script that can't make up its narrative mind, with a father son subplot that makes the word 'excessive' seem inexpressive, he is left, at the end of the movie, as a drunken murderous reversed Torquemada.The bludgeon bludgeons, no rhyme, no reason, against a religious jones that makes a crack cocaine addiction seem a taste for a third chocolate chip cookie in comparison.In a country with declining church attendance, an increasingly secular country with the major sources of mass communication skeptical of all religious thought and practice, one wonders at the Director's angst. Maybe being named after two apostles is a heavier burden that can be imagined.The final scenes of degradation and violence caused me to almost turn my head. Why, what for, what in the movie or in Daniel Day Lewis' character brought us to such an ending? What personal experience brought Paul Thomas Anderson to such a nihilistic world view? This movie lover sat silent at the end wondering at what he had been subjected to and for what purpose? In There Will Be Blood, there is little exposition as to character motivation, and one personality who dominates the movie from beginning to end. I wish it had bee Daniel Day Lewis' Daniel Plainview, not Paul Thomas Anderson's self-loathing.",7,5,13,10 January 2008
Joker," A 'Triumph of the Will' for Nihilists
","'Joker' is a sick, disgusting, dark, evil, violent, total piece of scheisse. It will seriously affect emotionally troubled young people already pulled at by suicide, addictive behaviors, and hopelessness. It's like a 'Triumph of the Will' for nihilists. I would defer from voting for Joaquin Phoenix for best actor until i see video of his normal non-acting self...it may be he wasn't acting in 'Joker' at all and is one majorly screwed up dude. And, what a weird alien body. He's naked from the waist up a lot in 'Joker' and, from the waist up, is, let's say, disquieting. All taut skin stretched tightly over an alien bone structure. The bones stick up and out at odd angles, in odd places, like the exoskeleton of a medical experiment gone wrong. Not a single pleasant moment in the movie. Not a moment of joy, nor beauty, nor happiness. No catharsis from all the misery and violence, just a stomach churning emptiness at the thought that the last fifty years have come down to this, and this is a circle of despair. A movie without hope, without humanity, showing a world that no sane person would live in.",2,29,62,9 October 2019
Jojo Rabbit," A Good German
","A fascinating, moving, funny, multi-layered movie experience. Memorable. Not really a satire or a comedy. Wonderful set decoration and attention to period clothes. Many surprising twists and turns done with style and imagination and, despite the war and Nazis, gentleness. A Wes Anderson-esque examination of the effect of fanaticism and war on a society, a town, on families, on children and on one particular sweet little boy. The end, which could have been saccharine, over the top, or forced...perfect instead. With a perfect soundtrack sending us out of the theater, but making sure that JoJo, and his mom, a good German, will live on in our imaginations.",9,3,12,26 October 2019
Pineapple Express," Don't Bogart that Script My Friend
","It was very pleasant to get stoned in the sixties. The ritual of rolling a joint, the Michelangelo's of joint rolling whose joints did not deserve to be smoked they were so beautiful, the frisson of Narc danger, the towels under dorm room doors, the perfect music. Could Inagadadavida be recorded today? One joint and the Allman Brothers at Fillmore East could get you from Satellite Beach to Santa Monica in one dazed trip with gas at 29 cents a gallon and three deuces and a four speed growling out the state lines in pre ethanol days. Dashikis and Afros, candles and light shows, multiple attendances at any showing of Fantasia.Of course the preceding is mere reportage and inference from what others told me, and some reading on the subject.Indeed, a book I am reading at present, 'My Name is Will', does a good job of bringing the druggy sixties into the similarly druggy mid-eighties. The eighties: ground zero of Nancy Reagan's 'Just Say No' campaign and the criminalization of of anything that would get you higher than a kite can fly. Except, of course, alcohol. An aside: I was once in the company of the main lobbyist of the 7-11 Corporation in Florida, during the late eighties and he, high one night on Miller and Marlboro Lites, told me he was in the drug business: you know, he said, alcohol, nicotine, and sugar. Hmmm, Nancy never said 'no' to those drugs.A long preamble to why I disliked 'Pineapple Express' so much.There is a proud, admittedly liberal in structure, history of extremely funny stoner movies in these United States. Ambling, discordant, self indulgent, silly, and freaking funny...their central plot device: the cool, laid back stoners and the Man. The humor arising from making the Man look silly and in shared common moments of stoner-dom. Like in California eating nine tacos at two in the morning. Or in Chicago, talking the Greek guy through every thin slice from the spit, like a surgeon teaching a gall bladder operation to interns, to make a perfect gyros sandwich in the wee hours. I am told that connoisseurs of the best bud are connoisseurs of the best gyros stands. Eaten, standing at the window, as the hawk makes hungry stoners long for the soft January Siberian night rather than a typical mid-January Chicago: weak sunlight seldom penetrating the clouds of snow hovering two stories above the city. Late night micturation against a greystone an exercise in imaginative ice sculpture. Or, to get back to a more universal gustatory experience brought on by evil weed, the purchase and consumption of an entire package of double chocolate Milanos whilst watching Cops wherever you live.This movie barely honors classic stonerdom but, when it does, it is very funny. But, for most of the movie, Pineapple lobs a grenade into those hazy fond memories of experience or fondly remembered movies. According to this movie, we no longer live in the mellow pot sixties. Forty years of chemical refinement seems to have created Frankenstein pot, stem cell pot, giga byte pot, pot which takes gentle 'screw the Man' plot devices and substitutes automatic weapons, massive fire power, gut wrenching wounds, severed ears, gallons of blood and a body count that 'Saving Private Ryan' would envy to support a ponderous plot that pot can not handle.Turgid New Age psycho babble. No stoned word associations from alpha to omega, Disney to Marx, time travel to space travel, buttons? who invented them...really...what chocolate really tastes like. No, in a 21st Century power pot movie, we get awkward social situations verbalized as cute not anarchic. A god-awful complicated who did what to who murder rampage story line that would ruin anyone's high.The plot: God knows...a murder most foul witnessed, friendship found and tested, a Sino-Corrupt Cop-Stoner conflict, Rosie Perez reminding us that time marches on, continuous doobie doing, an add on, for no reason, scene of selling dope to foul mouthed school kids, two corpulent African Americans with roles that are so demeaning that I hope they skipped the premier, a waste of two funny leads, who must be embarrassed at the power pot plot they had to inhabit.Worse, not even enough of a contact buzz to make me veer into World Market for a Ritter Bar with almonds afterwards.Hey! Even stoner movies need someone, as this script began transmogrifying from stoner to stupid, to say 'don't Bogart that script, my friend, pass it over to someone else to make it funny and funnier.'",3,8,30,12 August 2008
