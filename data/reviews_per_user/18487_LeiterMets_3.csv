Casablanca," one word YuCK
","The best part of this movie was when peter lorre walked in with a gun....and that wasnt even close to the scene in Titanic..with the hottie, Leo.  the chemistry between Humfrey Bogard  and Ingrid Berman is awful...not comparable to the homosexual chemistry between dan aakroyd and Danny Stern in Celtic Pride(i have noted this b4 in a [previous review)  The philepeno burglars made this movie what it was....and face it...who wants to see a movie in black and white...that was the kiler and i give it a bad grade
MY RATING- 1 outta 10   1 star",Null,0,3,24 December 2002
Memento," Blew my mind.
","After hearing some hype and information about this movie, I was inclined to check it out. I figured I would like it, but wasn't positive on what to expect. I had no idea how unbelievably original and incredibly breathtaking Memento was. The entire concept alone was enough to keep my eyes glued to the screen, loving every second of what I was watching. The twists and turns that the film undergoes kept me on the edge of my seat, and the plot and script were simply enthralling. Everything about this film was perfect, and it is now easily my favorite movie ever.",10,0,0,10 April 2001
The Fast and the Furious," Dismal.
","If I wanted to watch cars go really fast, I would turn on ESPN2 at 3 in the morning instead of paying 9 dollars to watch pretty people do it. I am not sure but I do not think there was a plot, but maybe there wasn't supposed to be. I would say this movie is successful though, because it actually pulled off making that much money without plot or acting ability. Looks like times have changed.",1,4,10,8 January 2002
