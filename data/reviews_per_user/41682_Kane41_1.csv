Despicable Me 2," LIGHTBULB! Not so bright. REVIEW with SPOILERS!
","Back in April I posted a reply on the boards indicating a sentiment of anticipation that I could not wait to see Despicable Me 2 having loved the first.I take my words back.It was enjoyable but I could have waited!Not as fresh, not as funny, not as simple or as visually fantastic or as big hearted as the first.Suffers a classic case of 'the sequel needs to be bigger' - which lays the way for busy visuals and too many subplots, in turn over complicating the story and cooling the focus of its heart.Is it fresh? No - what main plot of villainy there is, is boring. Although Gru and Agent Lucy Wilde's relationship is predictable it is handled efficiently enough that you hope boy gets girl and vice versa if only for Agnes' sake.It is funny? It's a mixed bag lacking the warmth of the first film, so the myriad of gags try harder in this (unsuccessfully) through added comedic violence. The main laughs are, for the most part, made up by antics of the Minions - these little yellow guys are no longer the side show to the wit of Gru and the delicious voice delivery of Steve Carell.Is it simple and visually fantastic? I'll say no - that's not to say the CG animation is not fantastic - it is as you would expect dazzling! But is it way too busy and that was the joy of the first.Is it big hearted? I think you can manage an answer from the observations above and your own feelings once you've seen it. I'll put it this way - it does try - but there is nothing in DM2 that comes close to Gru's bed time storytelling.The story arc of 'family' is now complete for Gru and the girls - moving forward I hope Despicable Me 3 is a prequel - of a time when Gru, Dr Nefario and the Minions were still up to no good.6.5/10I didn't mean to call you a meat loaf, Jack !",6,7,15,22 June 2013
