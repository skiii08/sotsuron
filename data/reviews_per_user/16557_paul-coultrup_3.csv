Iron Man 3," ** Spoilers** Stick to the established storyline....disappointing
","Saw the midnight showing of Iron Man 3.....why do they muck around with the already established story lines??!! They really should have kept to the basics of the Mandarin storyline....in a word disappointing! No Mandarin and the ten rings of power, the Mandarin character in this film is a bit of a joke. Extremis was supposed to be given to stark which enhanced his capabilities...not in this film. Aldrich Killian and the Mandarin were never the same person!! Why fuse the two characters together ? Also Iron Mans armor was too easily broken in this film. How can Iron Man survive a one on one with Thor and survive lightning which can reach 30,000c, yet in the film it disintegrates at 3000c.Good points, good humor, action is well done.Its OK to watch but don't expect them to stick to the basics of the Mandarin and Extremis story lines.",6,89,177,25 April 2013
X-Men: Apocalypse," Throughly Enjoyed, critics don't know Jack!
","Saw it last night. With all the negativity surrounding this film, I expected to come out somewhat disappointed. But my view was quite the opposite. Loved the story, Magneto was great, liked his back story in the film. I thought that Apocalypse was one of the better villains, although his power wasn't really shown in the film as it is in the comics. The new younger xmen characters all did the characters justice. Really liked nightcrawler, thought he was one of the better portrayed Xmen.The film was well timed, liked the pace leading up to the final conflict. I would quite happily see it again. Ignore the critics and go see it :-)",9,9,20,20 May 2016
Guardians of the Galaxy," Great Start to Guardians of the Galaxy **Spoiler**
","Saw it at a UK Premier tonight and totally loved it. Great Humour, action, decent villain, good storyline. Saw it at an IMAX, which really added to the film. I really thought the humor was well done in this film, action was well done as well as the Guardians Universe that we got to see.The only negatives that could really pick up on was the story of the group coming together was a bit weak, I couldn't see why that chose to stay together. Also I would liked Ronan to have played more of an action part....but the screen time he had he was still menacing.I was so glad to finally see Thanos in this, looking forward to seeing how the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy storyline will pan out.Definitely will see it again.",9,6,17,24 July 2014
