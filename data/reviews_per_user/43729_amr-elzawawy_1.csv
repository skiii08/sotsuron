10 Cloverfield Lane," 7.5 is a 7 right ?
","This was very much more than i expected,in a good way. From the start of the movie,the music and sound effects took my ears into the movie's world.My attention to the movie kept increasing with it as well not just in the start. It was very harmonic with the movie and was a huge asset to me liking the movie if i am honest. The director,the scenario, and of course the acting was other elements non the less that also amazed me and kept me on the edge of my seat. John Goodman delivers an Oscar worthy performance with such a complex character and so much details in the character and no time to build it up but he did it all and delivered me the complete feeling of the character. Marry, i didn't see her before this in anything but this was so good too very much into the survivor character. The only thing that wasn't good for me was the last 20 minutes 'the aliens part'. I mean it is a good thing for endings to be 'not see that one coming' type but this was so far and i accepted it but there must have been any good build up to lead to it not just throw it to the watchers and hoping they accept it.Though,i liked her decision at the end where she decides to fight that was good. Overall it was a good movie just didn't like the ending that much but yet a new idea and good movie to watch. 7.5/10",8,0,1,6 September 2017
