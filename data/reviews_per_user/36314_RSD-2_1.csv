The Blair Witch Project," A great build up with the crappiest ending i have ever seen in a movie.
","This movie was Unforgivable because of the ending. It presented a fantastic build-up and story, only to throw it all away in the last 20 minutes, which were unforgivable. I won't spoil it, but I felt cheated.",5,0,2,6 July 1999
