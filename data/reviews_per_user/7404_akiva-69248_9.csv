First Man," If you like watching Ryan Gosling stare at something or nothing without talking you'll love this
",Somehow they figured out how to make the first moon landing boring. I must have nodded off three times during this thing. Evidently Neil Armstrong had zero personality and was mostly a mouth breather since he usually just stared at stuff with his mouth open without saying anything. If you are expecting the drama of Apollo 13 you will be disappointed.,5,2,2,12 November 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Excellent...
","Never boring, this film kept me interested the whole time. Great music, good portrayals of the band. What's not to like?",9,3,4,11 December 2018
Watchmen," Couldn't make it to the end
",Storyline is muddled and confused. Took so long to develop that I just gave up on it.,2,2,17,20 April 2019
Captain America: Civil War," Meh
","It was OK, but just OK. Captain America is defending a murderer because he is his old buddy from Brooklyn. Nothing is resolved at the end. The special effects/fights were good but you didn't really know who to root for... just didn't do it for me. Perhaps if there would have been some resolution to the conflict between Captain America and Tony Stark that might have rescued this movie for me. I'm sure they will make the next movie with Captain America swooping in to rescue Stark and or his beloved Pepper in order to bring him back into the Avenger fold. This just seemed like an unfinished piece of work. May this is the Empire Strikes back of the Avenger series. LOL",6,23,44,29 May 2016
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," This is The Hobbit?
","OK this (actually all 3) movie(s) have very little resemblance to the book. If you have not read the book, then you may like these interpretations but if you've read the book, the half the time you will be wondering where THAT came from.
The Rankin and Bass animation actually was more true to the author's vision than these 3 monstrosities of movies are.",3,1,2,15 December 2019

Black Panther," Meh. Just OK
",It was OK. Not really worth the price of a theater ticket. Probably wouldn't watch it again...,5,1,3,20 April 2019
The Proposal," Worth a watch
",Pretty funny and even a bit touching. (It IS a rom-com after all). Betty White is great as usual and the movie doesn't waste time with tedious setup.,8,0,0,17 June 2019
