Hereditary," Severly impressive
","That the director got her start in motion pictures with this title is quite astonishing to consider. Not only is the film an effective slow burn horror film, but it so well made. The lighting is impressive, the editing is brilliant, the dialogue as real as they come and the camerawork is masterful. Also, the film is well researched in intelligently places itself in the tradition of Rosemary's Baby, the Omen and the Exorcist, as well as newer films such as the Ritual and the Conjuring. Not only is the film creepy and atmospheric, but at times brutally raw, both in terms of visuals and emotions.I almost missed out on this one, as the marketing made it sound rather boring, but I am glad I changed my mind and gave it a chance.The actors are worthy of mention for their incredibly emotional and believable performances. At times I felt like I was watching a film by Kubrick, in terms of how far the actors go to convey their characters. And if Toni Collette doesn't deserve an oscar for this one, no one ever does.",10,1,2,20 July 2018
The Conjuring 2," return to greatness, for real
","I've avoided new horror films for a few years now, considering they all seem to cater to young audiences with no ability to concentrate or follow a plot. Recently however I've been baffled by a few new comers, such as the Conjuring and its sequel.Not only is this film scary, it's beautifully shot, and the set dressing is quite simply astonishing. Some of the gags come a bit out of nowhere, but overall the atmosphere is great. The film has an attention to detail you just don't see very often.The con artists whose adventures this series is based on have a long list of other exploits, and I really hope there will be a whole slew of films like this one.",8,0,2,21 July 2016
