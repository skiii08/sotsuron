Captain Phillips," everything's gonna be OK
","This is what we call 'The Movie' excellent job cheers....to Captain Phillips and his crew members, and a big bow to Navy Seals terrific simply terrific. Paul Greengrass has done it again after The Bourne Ultimatum. The Legendary Tom Hanks has done complete justice to his role as the Captain, no one suits well better than him. Mr.Hanks at his best. Great Movie for the Holiday Season. You will be speechless at the end. Don't miss the ship, it will sails you from the top to bottom of your heart mind and emotions. I rank this movie No.1 from the Sony pictures. Go and watch not for just one time. Captain Phillips and Gravity the two Masterpieces we witnessed this year.",10,2,4,1 December 2013
