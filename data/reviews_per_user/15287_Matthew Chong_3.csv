Minority Report," Movie Magic Masterclass
","The movie is a masterclass of how stupid improbable ideas can be designed to look great and realistic (`pre-crime' psychic-palm reader bollix, retina-activated ads wasting ad budgets on a passing guy instead of the crowd around him, updatable newspapers that have to be held up with both hands like old newspapers taking up two seatwidths, doing tiring aerobics/music conducting just to open an Email, telling everyone in the room your password just to utilise voice-activation tech, `skyway-hiways' driving skyscraper residents mad, etc) - give me a break. sexy looking though.  Unlike most sci-fi movies, this one has been hyped for its tapping of the ideas of futurists and product designers, who unfortunately are usually more concerned with how fantastic their own visions in their own fields are than whether these are possible in the greater future reality. Hence, one has to take issue with this aspect for MR more than the out-and-out fantasies that are Star Wars, Superman or Pretty Woman.Unlike the beautiful snooze-fest A.I. (.also my exclamation after enduring to the end of that film), MR is a proper effects masterpiece with the classiness no George Lucas directed show can come close to.  Cruise is a De Niro of action stars, his very presence in a scene oozing charisma, be it as a part of an emsemble, an action sequence or a wordless close up.  SS is der ubermann of Movie Magic.  I'm putting more cash in his offshore accounts when the DVD comes out.",8,0,0,6 September 2002
The Bourne Identity," Professional Hit
","Straightforward auctioneer that's not over-indulgent or fantastic.  Having read Ludlum's commercial pot-boiler as in the early 80s as a kid, I expected possibly a louder B-grade flash-bang version of the dull 1988 TV movie starring Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith.  I'm glad to say that the film is better although there are many changes to turn it into a 'blockbuster' action show.  It delivers a quite consistent level of well shot action/violence (Frankenheimer's excellent Ronin with its European setting comes to mind) and easy-to-understand intrigue.  No Bond gadgets, John Woo bullet ballets or gangsta pansy posing.  People complaining about it lacking the depth of the book can't seem to understand the book-to-film transition, and that this is no classic literary tome in the first place.Despite Damon's natural easy-going boyish charm, his character remains a cold professional throughout, curt in speech and clinical in action, commanding authority even when he decides to bang the chick.  It could have been a Talented Mr Ripley conflict of coldness and vulnerability, but Bourne comes across in the end as lacking any strong characterisation, probably quite apt for a professional killer.  This opens the film to arguments that the characters are never fleshed out properly, which is not important here. The female interest (Franka Potente) grows increasingly irritating as Lola becomes tired of Running.Being released in competition with another actioneer with a European setting, the flashy xXx with Vin Diesel, the Bourne Identity delivers a professional Hollywood job with a Euro feel, despite the indie roots of the director (Doug Liman).  Probably won't win any Oscars but it sure wins a place in my shortlist for DVD buys.  Well made watchable entertainment.",7,0,1,18 September 2002
