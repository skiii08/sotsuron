Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Very funny in parts, bordering on depraved!!!!
","I thought this film was well worth going to the cinema for. As far as comedies go this was highly entertaining yet bordering on depraved. It predudicely portrays images of lots of genres of people but thats what the entire film was about. I wont go into the details of the different sort of people he 'takes the biscuit' out of but i can assure you he racially discriminates, predudicely describes and physically assaults people.The main message this film gets out between all of the above is the sheer ignorance of some people. It also shows the tough American image but mocks them at the same time! I would go as far as to say he mocks Americans more than puts any other type of people down. Look at the film for yourselves, very funny if you like a bit of depravity for a change.",7,2,8,6 November 2006
Coraline," Not for children
","This movie is way too intense and horror like for any child. It's exactly like an adult horror only animated. I have no idea how this film managed to be allowed to be classed as a children's movie. It's end to end chilling with spirits, ghosts and demons jumping out every few minutes. Not to mention the gothic witch demon. The dark spiritual vibe going on throughout will only frighten the life out of your kids. It's way too dark to be a kids movie. I'm shocked. It's borderline abuse letting your kids watch this horror. If your gonna let them watch this you might aswell follow on with The Exorcist, then maybe Nightmare on Elm Street.Maybe this is one of those indoctrination movies designed to fk up kids heads, like MK Ultra or something, haha. Or maybe I should just put back on my tin foil hat ðŸŽ©",2,0,6,25 July 2019
The Love Guru," This film is absolute garbage.
","I pity the people who wasted their money going to the cinema for this film. It represented one of the worst comedies i have ever watched. Actually one of the worst comedy i have ever tried to watch.From the offset it had incredibly ridiculous attempts to make you laugh. It focused wholly on what people have found funny in the past, like farting, belching, small people. These are the three things that kept cropping up again and again and again. They kept forcing these jokes on the viewers with a pause afterwards to give people the chance to muster up a chuckle.Really i think they should give the viewers a bit more respect. And i also think cinemas should start saying NO to allowing such garbage being shown the large screen. They might be directed by big names but it proves here that known names don't necessarily make good films.",1,10,20,1 November 2008
I Am Legend," Worth a watch, special effects could be better
","I think this film is worth a watch, Will Smith was excellent, there's only a few actors who can carry a film on their own for the majority of minutes and he fits the bill perfectly. the idea of the film was good, mainly the same as 28 days later but set in new york. the idea of a film like this i feel is to have a short story line but to put a lot of attention into details, like acting and special effects. the acting was carried off well, as i mentioned earlier, the special effects unfortunately didn't carry off as well. i felt that the enemies were straight out of a computer game, it worked well in I-Robot because they weren't human to begin with but when your talking about zombies they have to be as realistic looking as humans, maybe just missing a couple parts of there body, this could have been mixed with the computer effects to produce life like images.all in all it was quite entertaining.",7,1,3,28 December 2007
Transformers," Good Flick just missing a certain element of class...
","I wish i could rate this 7.5 out of 10. since you cant rate in halves i decided to go down to 7 rather than go up to 8. Reasons because, although this had the makings of an awesome rendition to the original cartoon it was lacking a certain element of class. Its great to see something that you loved as a kid appearing on the big screen as an all action blockbuster. An all action blockbuster is what it was but still left me walking out of the cinema thinking 'so thats that, thats what i waited ages for!' Don't get me wrong i came out happy enough there are some excellent bits in the film, like some of the special effects were good, some acting was good, i liked some of the characters, Optimus Prime still had the same voice as the original, i think. Also had a few laughs throughout. Thats why i wanted to rate it 7.5. It lost 2.5 because of the following reasons: The Director tried to get the viewers to feel for the characters, e.g. the captain of the navy phoning his wife to say every things going to be OK etc etc, all seemed a bit Armageddon like. Also there were possibly too many jokes at times, i know the lead character was funny but i think he had something funny to say during every scene, even when hes being chased and shot at. The story that the exact whereabouts of the cube thing was embedded into the main characters great grandfathers glasses was a bit far fetched, also the whole auction web site thing, massive advertising.Anywho, its worth a watch.",7,1,2,25 July 2007
Pineapple Express," An unexpectedly great movie.
","this was a movie that my girlfriend wanted us to watch. usually when she wants to watch anything its normally a pretty awful movie. so i thought i would give it another go to see if her taste has picked up. anyway the first ten minutes had me slightly giggling, by half an hour through i was laughing, then further through it had me in stitches, have to say ill let her pick another one at some stage throughout the year!!! enjoy the flick guys.OK i have to write more because i have to write a minimum of ten lines, but hey, this was a worthy film to write about. another reason i agreed to watch the film is because i thought Seth Rogan was good in superbad and i think he was in knocked up too, another good film but this i have to say tops the poll.now enjoy the film people!!!",8,0,2,16 November 2008
The Simpsons Movie," As Expected... A Great 1.5 hr Episode of the Simpsons.
","The film was well worth waiting for. I have been an avid fan of the Simpson's since i was a kid. The series has been going on now much longer than i would have ever expected. It has brought my family together every Sunday at the same time every week to watch a new episode of what i would call the best series ever made. As everyone knows the Simpsons has brought upon the era of family entertainment, no other cartoon has ever had so much in common with a family of viewers from every continent in the world. I wont keep dragging on about how good the Simpson's are as a whole as you already know that. Unless your one of the very few who for some reason are insulted by some of the goings on (yes not very many people) but anyway about the film. I wasn't expecting an absolute cracker, i was just expecting a long episode of the Simpson's, and thats what i got and i got some great laughs out of it. Well worth watching as every episode would be.",8,5,9,6 August 2007
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," over the top trousers around the ankles humour...
","If you really like Will Ferrell you should quite enjoy this film. It has some laughs right the way through but the only putting off point to these laughs is that there's a quiet moment for a couple of seconds after to give everyone watching a chance to redeem themselves and cool off from the laughter. To be honest this is unwanted silence because the jokes aren't really that funny.Yes OK as I said there are some humorous points but the main jokes are focused on Will Ferrell screaming, which I don't find that funny. Actually I would put this down as a put off showing the stereotypical character of a drunken American loud mouth. This running around with your trousers around your ankles screaming mercifully for about 10 minutes gets boring and at times ridiculous and when the audience laughs for the 1st 2 minutes the cinema is left quiet until this ludicrous satirical episode ends.Another point to add about Will Ferrell would be to say that he lacks the ability to hold a film and make it his as the leading actor, having said that I think he would be a fantastic accompaniment to a film but too much screaming affects any real judgement on whether he can act. I know it was meant to be a comedy but even Jim Carrey's antics made more sense than some of the ones in this film.Other than that I thought the French character Gerard played by Sasha bohen (Borat) was a generous addition. Even though the French accent was made a little bit more ridiculous than it actually is, maybe the words were a bit drawn out but the film needed this transition as it took away from Will Ferrell's over compromising character.All in all this film was OK but I could have easily not watched it and had as much fun staying at home and watched an old Sopranos or something, but if u like Will Ferrell screaming and doing silly things constantly then this is the one for you.",4,3,5,3 October 2006
