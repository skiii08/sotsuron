Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Uniquely Funny No Doubt but....
","The only question I have is how much of it is spontaneous and how much is staged? That fact notwithstanding,B:CLAMBGNK is definitely a superbly acted, well directed and creative piece of comedy.There were certain scenes from the movie that rocked me out of my chair, almost praying for the comedy to stop lest my stomach turned inside itself.B:CLAMBGNK also presents a very introspective look at the narrow blinder view many Americans have when it comes to 3rd world nations and their people.Borat expounds this naivet√© tendency brilliantly albeit controversially. The scene with the frat boys in the RV was pretty telling that racist undertones are very much present even in the 21st century in modern America, yet subtle. Overall this is a new kind of comic genre, sadly one that can be done only once, and then the gig is up and it becomes rote if repeated.On the other hand if it does get repeated, then it just further establishes how stupid and naive people can be. I actually had a colleague ask me which part of Russia this guy was *really* from, London England with a degree from Cambridge was the answer he expected...N O T!",8,1,7,15 November 2006
Split," Idiotic Storytelling saved by some good acting.
","There are so many flaws in this movie, it just proves that the story wasn't really well thought out. For a terrific MPD movie watch Identity, this however seems like a poor copy. M Knight Shyamalan has been exposed as a one hit wonder, his movies since Sixth Sense basically sucked. Waste of time, but for some terrific acting by McAvoy.",5,2,7,9 July 2017

Super 8," Pathetic waste of time
","Wish there was a 0 rating. The movie was absolutely awful, how many times will directors try to stuff ugly alien with amazing technology down our throat.Very slow narration and build up. Reminded me of Ang Lee trying to put a personality behind The Hulk. So many loopholes in this movie , we are to believe the thing kills its victims, okay it doesn't, what does it use them for? Just too predictable. We see the thing getting out of the train in the first bit and we have to almost wait an eternity to see its ugly head again, and its not worth it. For all the hype that was thrown its way it hasn't delivered, and anyone comparing it to ET, get a grip , a bit of bottle and see the doctor. The movies are poles apart.",1,203,378,11 June 2011
The Last King of Scotland," Great Movie
","LKOS is one of those movies that requires guts to act and freedom to make. Amin was a terrible human being an even worse ruler, close to the likes of say a bloodthirsty Mongol Horde. Kudos to Forest Whitaker who plays Amin exceptionally well,the scare and stupidity factor nicely entwined. I know people who escaped from Uganda swearing this was Amin personified a stupid brute with enormous power yet with the inkling, attitude and mentality of a child. Utterly inept yet his intimidation was one that could weaken knees. The Garrigan character closely resembles another Brit who was in the employ of Amin as a close adviser, Bob Astles. Whitaker should win the Oscar for this splendid portrayal of a terrible monster with such perfection. The East African accent is definitive and masterful. Of course they did add some dramatic license regarding Garrigan's escape but all in all a great movie.",9,3,4,29 January 2007
Casino Royale," Bond Resurrected, Awaiting Verdict Though
","What this movie is not, it is not an overhaul of the franchise, but an attempt to bring back to the fore the real Bond from the books. It took awhile to warm up to Daniel Craig, but by the end he epitomizes Bond very well.There are Bonds and then there are Bonds, this one is a different cut of Bond.If Pierce Brosnan was a natural debonair, Daniel Craig is a ruggedly suave version of the same, while Brosnan's Bond was a poor runner, poor on action and poor on stunts, Craig's Bond makes up for all these and then some. The first chase scene in Madagascar was just too incredulous to be believable, but that is the only major lapse in logic I found throughout the movie which went from strength to strength from then on. After a whirlwind run through the Caribbean and the USA, the movie settles on its main story, the card game in Montenegro, which plays out extremely well, with surprises popping out in every turn. Overall this is a great movie, Daniel Craig, for all the crow he received, comes out blazing,he plays Bond fast, aggressive and hard.The movie shows Bond maturing from one with a heart to an icy cold killer. Since this is the newest incarnation of the secret agent,grand laurels need to wait until after the next few to see if he really bites into the role of Bond with his teeth.",8,1,3,20 November 2006
Alien: Covenant," Very ordinary film with some good sequences
","This was a very ordinary film, the like we've seen dozens of times over and over. But it did do the important task of attempting to stitch together the end of Prometheus and the beginning of Alien.That said there are LOTS of poorly constructed story and answer lines.e.g.*The Engineers do not share their technology, they incubate their clone offspring to amalgamate with their new host planet and that's it. That's what they did for us, yet here we are to believe that Planet 4's people have seen and used the Engineer spaceships before?*David for all that he's become is still a machine, for a machine to transcend machine learning and make cogitative decisions especially those pertaining to right and wrong and pretty unbelievable.*The Engineer Homeworld is clearly a misrepresentation, this planet was just an outpost or colony, you can hardly expect a neo-sentient species to reside on one planet in one city?! * I did enjoy the parts of nature and beauty of this new world. It did look natural and virgin for such a transformation to take place.* Captain T taking the huge mothership down to the planet was utterly ridiculous. Even in stories of old, that would never happen. Also how utterly ridiculous was it that spouses and partners traveled together. Obviously emotional decisions will be made antithetical to logical and rational ones, leading up to poor results.Can't believe they missed all this.All that said, I am somewhat satisfied, at least we know what and where Prometheus led to. It does appear that this is a fan created movie, one which Ridley Scott *had* to direct out of popular appeal rather than artistic need.",6,0,7,24 May 2017
