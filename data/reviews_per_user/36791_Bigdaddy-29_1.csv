The Blair Witch Project," Don't Believe the Hype
","Pin a tag on me, because I'm a victim of the hype machine. I'm so embarrassed. Hey, here's an idea for the BWP producers (and ALL producers, for that matter): If you're going to do a movie called The Blair Witch Project, have a darned WITCH in it! I haven't felt this betrayed at the end of a piece of art since I read Thomas Harris's 'Hannibal.' And I don't believe for one second that the actors were improvising. Okay, maybe the dialogue during some of the more stagnant parts (which were WAY too frequent), but certainly not at the end. I'll be haunted by this movie, that's for sure. But it will be the haunting feeling of high expectations left dashed on the rocks of mediocrity.",Null,0,1,14 August 1999
