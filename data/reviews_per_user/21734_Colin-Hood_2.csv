Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," SHOCKING - Only reason it got 1 is scale went no lower.
","Worst movie I have seen in a long time and I have seen some shockers. The plot was terrible and most of the best bits were seen in the previews. Will not recommend this movie to anyone at all, maybe the producer should make contact with either working dog in Australia or Happy Madison in the USA on how to make a comedy. The grouse factor was there and it made me sick in the stomach. Sasha, you can keep that kind of humor, I should have realized that you would find it hard to make a good movie from a bit sketch from the Ali show. I must be out of touch with the public seeing I rated this movie so low. I am not a stickler, as I enjoy a good laugh, but there is a limit to how much you can grouse out an audience.",1,105,211,27 November 2006
Blood Diamond," Fantastic
","For me to sit still in a movie cinema for 2 hours plus is an amazement, but this movie had me doing this the whole way through. The characters parts were well written and I thought Leonardo played is parter as Mr Archer really well (This hurt me to say - as I have not enjoyed any of his movies since Romeo and Juliet). The story line was fantastic and made me leaving the cinema wondering how many conflict diamonds are out there on the market unbeknown to buyers. I also liked the fact this movie didn't contain the usual American ending where the bad guy who gets a conscious lives to fight another day. We can all think we doing the right this but are we really.If you care about world poverty and Mans greed at no matter what the cost (both economic and human) this is a must see movie for you to see you.",9,0,3,28 January 2007
