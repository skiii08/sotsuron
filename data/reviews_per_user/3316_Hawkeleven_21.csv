Requiem for a Dream," This movie will swallow you, chew you and throw you away
","Film that plunges us into a completely immersive suffocation is more than a movie, it is an experience that does not happen often in cinema. Best Jared Leto character of his career? Probably.",9,5,5,12 October 2019
Memento," Nolan always surprising
","It's brilliant how this movie was put together, a story that had everything to be banal, has turned into a monstrous movie about amnesia and what it feel's like to be in the role of the main character.",9,0,2,12 October 2019
12 Angry Men," Prejudice, justice and presumption of innocence
",Proof that a movie can be incredibly simple and spectacular at the same time. There's a quote from spinoza that sums up this movie well; 'What Paul says about Peter tells us more about Paul than about Peter'.,10,0,0,12 October 2019
The Hateful Eight," The best tarantino movie!
","Is it just me that I think this is the best Tarantino movie overall? Photography, soundtrack, the cast, the lines, the story, the twist ... How does so much quality fit in a single movie?",9,2,6,12 October 2019
Crash," Movie with good intentions, and a bad execution
","This movie has so many parallel stories and flaws that makes emotional connection with the characters impossible. It's too boring to watch, too much racial scenes that hardly happen in real life, nothing seems to be real in this movie, everything is too forced, too many pointless parts, like a feiled shot to a child in his father's lap, where his father then turns around his back and simply goes home doing nothing, sexual harassment by a police officer to a woman in front of her husband and her husband not being affected either during either after that scene, a man has a car robber trying to steal his car In the right seat of the car, while he's chased by the police and ordered to stop and starts arguing with the cops instead of reporting the car robber, a movie with an interesting story, but awful directed.",5,0,1,13 October 2019
Shutter Island," Scorsese Masterpiece
",The kind of movie that make you question every single thing since the beginning. Terrific movie. Great plot here!,9,1,2,12 October 2019
Interstellar," A movie to question our existence
","A film that gives us proposals about our purpose as humans, about the concept of time and space, and about the most intimate places inside the human being, is like going outside inside. Nolan did it again...",9,0,1,12 October 2019
Forrest Gump," A Life Instruction Manual
","If you want to understand what let it go and be in the flow of life it's important, Forest Gump will teach you the lesson in the best way possible. A film that will continue to be important to cinema history even 100 years from now, a true classic.",10,1,1,12 October 2019
The Butterfly Effect," The 'What If...' Movie
",Have you ever wondered what would happen if you made a different decision than the one you made at some point in your life? This movie is about that. Personally my favorite storyline of all time.,10,2,2,12 October 2019
City of God," There are few words to describe this movie
","Raw, sincere, carefree, without false pretense, order in the midst of chaos, a movie we should all see at least once in a lifetime.",9,3,4,12 October 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Worst Tarantino Movie
","I'm a big fan of Tarantino movies, but I have to admit that this is his worst movie, a waste of a brilliant cast, for a movie without purpose. The typical Tarantino ending was meaningless in this movie, it looks like we're watching two different styles, one that happens throughout the whole movie, and one in the final scene. Very boring movie. The usual phenomenon of 'high scoring film just because the director is reputable', I realize that it should make people feel intellectual by always giving good marks to well-known filmmakers, but it really misleads those who are guided by IMDB scores. If this movie were from a lesser known director the IMDB score would probably be 5/6.",6,4,5,11 December 2019
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," A movie that stirs the soul's gut...
","Dramatic, poetic, raw, tragic, passionate, a return to the innocence of childhood in a contrasting and heavy environment. A must see in the world war II movie category, great cast here!",10,0,1,12 October 2019
The Dark Knight," Christopher Nolan what else?
","I would say the best superhero movie of all time, but it's not the usual cliche blockbuster, and the main thing isn't superheroes actually, it's more like a psycho/mind/dark philosophy thriller. It's detailed, intense and engaiging, and of course, the last and best performance of Heath Ledger, it's too deep.",10,1,3,12 October 2019
2001: A Space Odyssey," Deep meaning, boring movie
","This movie was made in 1968, and for the time it have a great concept and a clever looking into how human race looks at it's own existence. But it's really boring most of the time nothing happens, you will watch two and a half hours of movie, but only 40 minutes or less of it really matters, it's too much time watching planets, stars and ships. In my opinion it had the potential to be a great movie, the idea it's really great, but it's not the masterpiece movie everyone says it is.",6,4,12,17 October 2019
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A deconstruction of love
","If you don't like romantic movies because they spoil the concept of love, this movie is for you. Out of the box movie!",9,0,0,12 October 2019
Saw," Not my kind of movie but...
","This film revolutionized the genre, few film has the quality of history and the crudity of this intense thriller. Simply brilliant!",9,0,3,12 October 2019
A Beautiful Mind," I doubt you won't love this movie
","Russell crowe's breathtaking performance in an engaging superb movie. If you're interested in learn about extremely developed minds, this is the best movie to watch.",10,0,0,12 October 2019
The Departed," Best Remake Ever
","Great plot, great actors, great acting, a movie that has no obvious ending. Scorsese did magic again.",9,0,2,12 October 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," Maybe The Best Movie Ever Made
","If you are looking for an inspiring jorney to feel the magic of life, you should stop searching and watch this title.",10,3,4,12 October 2019
Parasite," Movie of the year
","This film is completely out of the box, a social critic that doesn't choose sides. An absolutely brilliant masterpiece that takes us to a roller coaster of emotions with some kind of new cinematographic genre, that shudder and leave us groundless in a state of deep reflection about the model of society in which we live in. For those looking for an innovative film, with an unusual style, and with a necessary and relevant reflexion, Parasite is the right and the better choice. Impressive work by the director.",9,11,16,4 February 2020
Gladiator," Great Movie
","This movie is a masterpiece in all aspects, i watch it in theatre and it was terrific.",10,1,2,19 September 2019
