The Avengers," Very very good but not without its flaws and has room for improvement
","Let me just state something from the beginning, I had extremely high expectations for this movie and that deeply affected how I viewed this movie. I have not seen Iron Man 2 or all of the Incredible Hulk before seeing this movie so that may have effected my view as well.Alright now to the movie. This movie in general has some great parts and some terrible parts. The first half of the movie was very slow but understandable because of the need to introduce the characters. Toward the beginning/middle of the movie, in all honesty, I hated it. I just felt that it was terrible. I didn't understand it at all, but the movie went on and things were okay after that.The character's dialog was very funny at times which had the whole theater laughing (Tony Stark: to Bruce Banner You really have got a lid on it, haven't you? What's your secret? Mellow jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed? for example.) Samuel L. Jackson did a decent job as Nick Fury, but was not as good as I would have expected from him. Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Jeremy Renner, and Scarlet Johansson all gave very good performances. Chris Hemsworth was good but not great as Thor but I don't feel he was given enough screen time. Tom Hiddleston was OK as Loki but not great. The CGI however was very good and the 3D was not very distracting even though at times it did bother me.I think the absolute best parts of this film was the action sequences as they were very good but could be better. The large action sequence near the end when the alien army attacks is very good but simply could have been much better. If it had been extended and more intense explosions were included that would have solved the problems.The story itself seemed a little thin at times but then again I don't know how it could have been done much differently. This movie I see as the superhero equal of The Expendables which I felt had great action but a thin story and a cast of superstar actors. The entire movie seem a little off to me but that was just me. There was no deeper connection like I have with many great films.In the end, I only listed many of the negatives about the movie but there are many good things in the film as well. But all and all this is the best Marvel movie to date and I can't say I'm excited about Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe but we'll just have to wait and see. But like all Marvel movies, the more you think about them the less you tend to like them.",9,1,4,4 May 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Batman at War
","Going into the theater, I had extremely high expectations for this movie for 3 reasons. The first reason was that Batman Begins and The Dark Knight were both amazing, the second reason being Batman is my favorite super hero, and third because of Christopher Nolan directing! Nolan is my favorite director, and all of his work has been superb, my favorite being Inception, so I was praying he would not disappoint and oh he did not. I walked out of the theater after almost 3 hours, blown away and wishing it never ended. This movie is visually spectacular, but the story itself is great. I don't want to give much away but there is a twist that even as a Batman fan, I didn't even see it coming. The entire cast gives great performances, especially Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Anne Hathaway (who surprised me with her great performance), Tom Hardy, Joesph Gordon-Levitt and Morgan Freeman. This film is different from The Dark Knight as it is more of a war film (as stated by one of the cast members, i don't remember which however). This film has themes about the current political turmoil our country is in right now, something no other Batman film really has ventured into. Now for the ending of the film. The ending brought a huge smile to my face, and I truly loved it. But the ending is bittersweet as Nolan won't do another Batman film, meaning another now will be a disappointment. This movie receives my vote for movie of the decade!",10,3,7,21 July 2012
