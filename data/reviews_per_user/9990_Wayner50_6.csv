Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Why didn't this win best picture Oscar?
","'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is just an incredibly credible film! This should have easily won the Oscar for best picture, but of course, it wasn't a serious or 'important' picture. But, long after whatever did win is forgotten, WFRR will be watched and enjoyed. The performances are terrific, especially Bob Hoskins as hard boiled Eddie Valiant. Christopher Lloyd is both funny and frightening as the villainous Judge Doom, Joanna Cassidy manages to be the sane and secure anchor in the chaotic half Toon, half natural world. The great cartoons, Bugs, Mickey, Daffy, Donald, Porky, Dumbo and the rest actually look as if they are as real as the humans around them. Roger Rabbit and his knockout wife, Jessica, are terrific creations, and I hope we see more of them. The humor is both timeless and topical. The movie follows the traditional tough P I film formula seen in, among others, 'The Maltese Falcon' and 'Chinatown'. Other reviews have detailed the plot, so I won't belabor it here, just check out not only the feature, but also the extras on the DVD. Simply a great movie and a great accomplishment to meld the world of Toons and humans. 10!!!",10,3,3,14 November 2006
Meet the Parents," Unoriginal waste of talent
","Gaylord Focker. There, now you've seen (or read) just about the only original joke in the whole movie. It looks like a compilation of old 'Brady Bunch', 'Three's Company' or maybe 'Who's the Boss?' rejected scripts. Marsha's going to the Prom so Greg, Peter, or Bobby breaks her nose with a football, cleverly changed to a wedding and volleyball in this, Greg's fianc√©e's old boyfriend, Owen Wilson, in a thankless role, (Actually all of the roles are thankless or maybe worthless) builds a beautiful hand made wood gazebo, gee, you don't think Greg's stupid careless smoking will burn it to the ground, do you? Flushing the basement commode will flood the yard with sewage and ruin the wedding. Gosh, that'll never happen! The shame of this film is the total waste of talent and time, the best that can be said for it is, it's better than the sequel, which wastes Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand too.",3,1,3,24 April 2006
Troy," Entertaining epic, even if it doesn't exactly follow the legend
","'Troy' is a big time epic such as used to turned out regularly in the 50's and early 60's. Of course, the old epics were made without the advantage, or curse, of CGI. A top flight international cast really get into the ancient characters and armor. Brad Pitt might be a little to pretty for Achilles, but he's better than I expected. Orlando Bloom is very good as Paris, the cause of it all. Eric Bana is a heroic Hector and Peter O'Toole is perfect as the tragic and noble King Priam. Helen Kruger is super-desirable as Helen, 'the face that launched a thousand ships'. Brian Cox is the aggressive and arrogant Agamemnon, Brendan Gleeson is great as his blustering brother, Menelaus, Helen's cuckolded husband. Possibly the best performance is by Sean Bean as the crafty Odysseus, who finally comes up with the idea for the Trojan Horse that finally ends the siege. 'Beware of Greeks bearing gifts, or in this case, gifts bearing Greeks'. The battle scenes are exciting and well staged, they're based on historical data and are accurately executed. The only quibble is that the film doesn't follow 'The Illiad' completely, several major characters are killed before their time.All in all a very lavish, exciting and well done spectacle.",8,4,9,4 April 2006
A Bridge Too Far," Under-appreciated Movie
","'A Bridge Too Far' is a very fine film record of a spectacular Allied gamble and failure which was calculated to end World War II much earlier than it did end. Sadly, it failed, and the Soviets were the first into Berlin, setting the stage for the Cold War. As a film, it has a fine international cast, too numerous to mention. One thing that stands out is how much better the British stars (Michael Caine, Sean Connery, James Fox especially) are than the Americans (Elliott Gould and Ryan O'Neal especially). The movie sets the stage for the tragedy to come by intercutting the British, American, German military planning and deployments with scenes of Belgian civilians, both passive and resistance. The air and ground assaults are masterfully presented, as are the desperate battles in and around Arnhem to hold on in the Allied case, or to dislodge and capture the paratroopers on the German side. A good film in the tradition of 'The Longest Day'.",8,2,4,12 September 2006
Glory," Great Unit Tribute film
","'Glory' is a fantastic movie, featuring devotion to a cause, your fellow man, one's self and ideals. Duty is foremost to men who will fight for not only their own freedom, but others. The cast is first rate, Matthew Broderick perfectly portrays the idealistic Colonel Shaw, Cary Elwes is excellent as Col. Shaw's friend and second in command, who knows when to rein in his friend, Morgan Freeman is, as usual, excellent as Sgt Major Rawlins and Denzel Washington brings fire to Tripp, a performance that won him a well deserved Oscar. Jhimy Kenedy is very good as sharp-shooting Pvt Shartes, and the excellent Andre Braugher is, of course, excellent as Shaw's friend, Thomas Searles, who grows as the film progresses. The action starts with the battle of Antietam, the bloodiest day of American history. Shaw is slightly wounded and stunned. After the battle, he meets John Rawlins who is a gravedigger. Shaw goes back to Massachusetts where he is offered the command of the 54th Mass regiment, a 'Colored' unit. Overcoming his and Forbes's doubts they begin to form their command. They bring in Sgt Major Mulcahy (John Finn in a fine performance) to whip the recruits into a fighting unit. He also literally whips Tripp, after he's arrested for desertion. The troops learn that they won't get full pay and tear up their pay slips rather than accept the lower pay. They receive their rifles and uniforms and are assigned to a sadistic and crooked General in South Carolina, but they don't really fight, just terrorize defenseless civilians, while the general and his colonel double deal and loot the surrounding area. Shaw and Forbes confront the crooks and get the 54th transferred to a combat command. They go into the line and are bloodied but hold their ground, turning back two Confederate attacks. Their next assignment is to attack Fort Wagner, a coastal fort. The 54th charges across the beach, but are halted before the defenses and wait under fire for darkness to continue their assault. The fort is well set up for repelling attacks and they get to a moat, where they're again stopped. Shaw gets up and starts up the embankment only to be shot, Tripp picks up the flag and follows, but he's also killed. The rest of the 54th surges forward and gains ground, but comes upon Confederate cannon that blasts them into eternity. The epilogue tells us that all the attackers suffered huge losses, and the fort was never taken. 'Glory' is a unit tribute, like 'Go For Broke', 'The Fighting 69th' or 'Battleground'. Except for Shaw, the major characters are fictional. There's the wise old sarge, eager beaver klutz, tough guy who comes around, young sharp shooter who's never killed a man and the tough drill sergeant. Themen pull together into a unit, putting aside their differences for the greater good. In all aspects, this is a great movie, with great acting, cinematography and a score that's often heard on commercials and sometimes to advertise other films. If you're a Civil War buff, you've probably already seen it, if not, what are you waiting for?",9,1,2,25 April 2006
The Godfather," Great Gangsters
","The original 'Godfather' is the granddaddy (or maybe 'goddaddy') of them all. Followed up by two good sequels, the 1972 first film was the best. If we could have understood Marlon's mumblings it might have been even better! Al Pacino is terrific as young Michael Corleone, youngest son of Don Vito, played by Brando, who, all kidding about his dialogue delivery aside, gives an astonishing portrayal of a crime kingpin, a loving family man, a shrewd businessman and a loyal friend but a murderous enemy. My favorite performance, though, is James Caan as the fiery, hot tempered big brother, Sonny, Who is riddled by Tommy guns at a toll plaza ambush by rival gangsters. John Cazale is Fredo, the middle brother, who's not nearly as sharp or ruthless as the rest of the family. Talia Shire does very well in a pivotal role as the Don's only daughter, Connie. Robert Duvall is outstanding as the family consigliere, Tom Hagen, the Don's adopted son and legal adviser. Diane Keaton is very good as Kay, who will enter the family as Michael's wife, and discover the less appealing aspects of her husband and his family business. Richard S. Castellano and Abe Vigoda are both exceptional as the godfather's lieutenants. The plot is well documented in other posts, so I won't recap it here. The thing to remember is that all the people depicted are either criminals or beneficiaries of criminal activities, while they often show virtues, they are corrupted by money and power. This is a complex and moving film, filled with great lines, unforgettable characters and action. A worthy choice for #1 in this list, or any other.",10,0,2,17 June 2006
