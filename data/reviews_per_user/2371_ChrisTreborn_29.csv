The Rock," Stupid American Movie
","I hate Michael Bay's movies, it has no sensitivity, no reality, often questions viewer's IQ. This movie adds to that section. After 9/11 this movie definitely sucked, because of lack of depth in the story. Only plus point is its great cinematography, back ground scores and Ed Harris. Nicolas Cage tried to give his best even though he sucked in some on-screen chemistry with Connery. I don't know why Sean Connery agreed to do this project.I wish Jerry Bruckheimer should have spent that money to charity works. Go and watch this movie if you are psychic enough to take Michael Bay's crafted garbage.I gave this movie 0.The Rock = The Sock!",1,11,31,5 April 2005
Star Trek," Best Film of 2009
","I have been waiting for this moment, the end of 2009 to write the review which film should be crowned as the Best of this year. And after waiting for Avatar to release, I must say J.J Abrams' STAR TREK deserve the title to be The Best Film Of 2009.Based on a 1960s TV series, which got great fan-base and cult following, director J.J Abrams tells an original fresh tale with a different take. As the previous sequels failed in the box office the production company Paramount pictures originally intended for a Reboot, many talented well known directors decline to take over the project. But things really changed when Paramount decided to give the baby to the new blood of Hollywood.Writers Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci (who showed their reputation in dealing with preexisting materials, as in the movies Mission Impossible 3 and Transformers, which all got preexisting settings and their universe) created an important decision not to make a Reboot to the beloved 40 year old franchise. Their take was to make a sequel which really reinvents the beginning of Star Trek Franchise. And reuniting with director J.J Abrams we got both Visually as well as Story wise a great Cinematic experience.Star Trek (2009) (*****)Movie starts with a time traveled captain Nero(Eric Bana) who is looking for Ambassador Spock/Spock Prime(Leonard Nimoy), leading to the destruction of an entire star-ship. His quest for finding Spock was not only to hurt him, but to take revenge on all people who were responsible for the death of his beloved wife and their unborn child.Things went wrong when a young outcast cadet James T. Kirk(Chris Pine) comes against Nero.Based on the original characters created by Gene Roddenberry, director J.J Abrams with writers Roberto Orci,Alex Kurtzman tells the Eleventh chapter of STAR TREK saga. Frankly I am not a big TREKKIE fan, but I must say, I like this film for what it stands for. This film got lot of potential, even in story narration as well as in technical side.I didn't get the chance to see it on theaters, (because of my studies) but while watching it on DVD it got the Big spirit to shake my eyes away. As a VFX student I must give credits to all CGI artist for bringing this Giant out. Especially J.J Abrams for his signature Jerky Hand Held Camera works, which was new to a Sci-Fi movie, really gave an impression of Reality. And his visual sense for using Lens Flare in almost for all major scenes made exploitation of reality into a whole new another level.Also the editing done by Mary Jo Markey and Maryann Brandon for the camera works of Daniel Mindel made this captivating story into an action packed bonanza. And the cast assembled for this movie was so brilliant, that it fueled the proper tone for a canonical story. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto nailed their parts, but it was Eric Bana who really shined in the picture. (I hated all his previous films starting with Hulk!) I think it was his performance as the revenging antagonist that really made the whole story worked. Also Zoe Saldana's best performance this year apart from Sucking Avatar! Anything bad in this movie was it's music done by J.J's usual collaborator Michael Giacchino. He done an average job in doing space craft action scores, but failed miserably dealing with emotional parts. Especially Spock loosing his mother, his whole planet, there was no affective moods to enrich the scene. Even the trailer music('Two Steps From Hell' done by composers Nick Phoenix and Thomas J. Bergersen)was well known for it's dramatic tone. Abrams really should work with a good composer like John Powell or Brian Tyler.Anyway I really enjoyed this movie, it can capture both fan and no-fan audience alike. It's the Best Film of this year, I give this movie 10 out of 10 ! and I am waiting for the sequel in the Future.Star Trek = Best film of 2009",9,2,10,31 December 2009
Shaun of the Dead," 'This is how a Romantic Comedy Should be.'
","This film killed me, I couldn't breathe because of the non-stop laugh. This one is better than Exorcist.Shaun Of The Dead (Spoilers******)Story begins as Shaun (Simon Pegg) an average unattractive guy who lives with his buddy Ed (Nick Frost) and a non-buddy Pete (Peter Serafinowicz), gets troubles on the relation with beautiful Liz (Kate Ashfield). To make the matter worst, it all happens when the whole town goes on a strange biological change.That night to cure the broken heart, Shaun and Ed went on a bar to get drunk badly and parties at their apartment. Next morning Shaun wakes up with a new twist in his life. He finds that his town changed completely, and the people around him is now Zombies!What will he do next, will he go back to his (ex) girlfriend or he better fight for his own survival?Directed by Edgar Wright from the creation of Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright themselves, tells a romantic tale set up on the backdrops of Zombies. They did a great work by smartly blending romance and horror in the story with a touch of humor. The big thing I liked most in this movie was its editing. Wow what a pace cutting experience, all the credits goes to Chris Dickens for his masterful editing. Also soul for this Zombie movie was stunningly created by Daniel Mudford and Pete Woodhead under Nick Angel. I liked that heavy cues on attacks. Furthermore strangely, I found the man who did the sound version of my greatest Star Wars Villains Darth Maul, Mr. Peter Serafinowicz. He looked terrific in the role of Pete, even better on that Zombie version. Only thing I didn't like in this movie was, I think it lacked location recordings, and was dubbed by its respected actors. Even though, we get an interesting cinematic tones. It's a Great nice British movie.I give this movie 8 out of 10.Shaun Of The Dead = Fun of the Joy.",8,0,1,1 March 2005
Spider-Man 2," ' Trailer Rocked, Movie Sucked. '
","Sorry for this comment, But I got nothing else to say. I was a huge fan of Sam Raimi's first Spiderman. When he came up with second chapter by watching those trailers, Behind the scenes footage, premier notes, I expected a better sequel. But what I got.. a disgusting insulted trash.I was completely exhausted; it neither comes under a love story or an action movie. I was the most dumbest person to expect such greater stories from Colombia pictures. I got a stupid chubby love story. It was Crap; It's simply a Movie for the Sissies.Spiderman 2 (Spoilers******) I don't know who scripted this screwing story, being Spiderman the script didn't give Parker a dual personality. After the first original movie he must have something developed in his character but the script shows Parker like 'he was a looser, he is a looser and he always be a looser.' Tobey is still best in portraying Girly Peter Parker. Only God knows whether he has an expression called 'Anger'. Despite his body image I accept him as the confused Peter Parker in first movie which was well played by him. But this time, a role which was well established now in the second run, were fans willing to see his mature dark side, Tobey unnaturally shows his sissy side. Weak in dialogue presentation, no thick sound, no extreme expression he looked like a Bisexual chicken in Spidy/Parker costume. Also Kirsten Dunst was the worst part of the movie. MJ supposed to be a gorgeous character was more like a whore in Kirsten's hand. I hate J.K. Simmons from the first movie. He changed the enraged J. Jonah Jameson into an angry buffoon. Alfred Molina also sucked up his negative part, he has no mannerism in portraying the arch enemy which was done perfectly by the talented Willem Dafoe in the first movie. After Dafoe's surprise cameo, the only thing excited me in this movie was the performance of James Franco as a tortured soul thirsty for revenge. I am sure he will make a great villain like Dafoe in the coming chapter.The great villain in this movie was Sam Raimi. When the first movie released I always imagined Raimi's versatile take on - MJ discovering the truth 'Parker is Spiderman'. But I never expected he would do this much destruction to this franchise. Seems that entire people and their children plus their pets, discovered that Peter Parker is Spider-Man. Why he did such freaking turn-overs on Peter's secret identity. Raimi raped Spiderman and all his fans by doing this idiotic mastery.Also Danny Elfman failed miserably for giving a thrilling score comparing with the smashing music on the trailers. The only best thing from this movie is its trailer as well as the trailer music, which misguided me and lots of others for seeing this crap.All in all, the weak screenplay with ridicules story lines makes this lame chapter a big disappointment for the True fans. I wish Sony should have avoided this sequel; it should have taken a more time gap from the original movie without this lame plot. Making Maguire a more matured aged late 20's male with some strong sound and built. This movie is only meant for the sissy females and girl men, the true fans and the angry males like me hate these types of junks. 'I gave this movie 0 out of 100!'Spiderman 2 = Movies for the Sissies.Go and watch if you are that much sissy.",1,7,19,28 May 2005
Constantine," 'Better than Van Helsing'
","First of all there is no person in movie history who has devoted more time to defending civilization from evil and obliteration than Keanu Reeves. This man suites such perceptual roles, he lives in those spiritual roles and I think the only reason he was born, was to play Neo! He does not do movie for a living, he is not bothered about those stupid stardoms and more than that he is a great person in real life; I like those attitudes from an actor. Whenever he accepts a role, I am waiting to see the entities that made him to attract that movie.Constantine (Spoilers******)Directed by Francis Lawrence, brings the Silver screen adaptation of DC/Vertigo comic book 'Hellblazer' created by Jamie Delano and Garth Ennis. Francis Lawrence, make his best in creating a new style for presenting Constantine that makes us to forget it's a comic book movie.John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) a visionary man who believes that Heaven and Hell exists, he believes that when he die he would go to hell. From his childhood days he has seen such things that are far beyond from normal human interpretation. He/Movie takes beliefs of The Bible which says, presence of Demons makes humans evil and to prevent such things even tough he is not a priest he conducts exorcisms on effected victims. Tired out of 'Good and Evil' materials where Demon and Angles presences must exist to make a balance in the real world, Constantine is now thinking for a retirement. But things get changed when 'Mammon' the son of Devil tries to cross over the real world. Catch in the middle of the battle between God and Satan, the only hope for the mankind becomes Constantine.Scripted by Kevin Brodbin and Frank A. Cappello for the story of Kevin Brodbin himself; tells the unnatural story of a world which stands between Hell and Heaven. It's a nice plot, an outstanding treatment from these guys. But I think it could be more enjoyable if they write it in a less serious tone. The screenplay seemed to be so serious; some times it looked like an art movie. Also the soul of Constantine given by Brian Tyler, Klaus Badelt and Billy Howerdel was brilliant. The theme score was the best thing happened in this new age Movie History, it truly suited for the movie atmosphere.Also in the bright side we have director Francis Lawrence who did a tremendous work. Basing from the comic he created a world which was so real, appealing and interesting. The lead casting was good, Keanu as the disturbed Constantine and Rachel Weisz as the confused Angela Dodson/Isabel Dodson. Except them all others were worthless in the movie. Major mismatch was the Satan, the way the script as well as actor treated him was the worst thing in the movie.But hey the movie have some good things also; great photographic angles, visual EFX, gorgeous female cop, a great 'unspeakable relation' and a good seed for a Sequel.Constantine = Cause to tie.",10,0,3,21 March 2005
X-Men," Only because of Jackman's Logan.
","First of all I don't read X-Men comics, but knew some other favorite characters like Spiderman, Hulk from it's company Marvel. When I heard something about this movie that, based on some fire popping sunglass man, and some other superheroes team like G.I.Joe, I thought to miss that Hollywood Chink. But years later when I saw this movie I was Blown away.X-Men (Spoilers******) Directed by Bryan Singer tells the first silver screen adaptation of Marvel comics flick X-Men. After millions and millions of years, evolution has gone up so far that it created a new race called Mutants, a type of species superior than ours Homo Sapiens. Humans hates and fears such paranormal super powered individuals, making a new discrimination among peoples. While the U.S government going on a thick discussion on this matter, a powerful mutant called Magneto decides to end the discrimination among the people by following his dream project. His idea is to transform all humans into mutants by a machine he invented with the help of an energy absorbing power source.For that he has to go through his former friend Professor Xavier, a super-psychic mutant who believes that humans and mutants can live together in a peaceful world. He formed a mutant group called X-Men who helps for the goodwill of the world. For a good future of the both races X-Men finds Magneto and his evil mutants as their enemies. But things went wrong when a strange man named Logan and a girl called Rouge came between them.Scripted by David Hayter for the story of Tom DeSanto and Bryan Singer himself tells the cinematic version of Stan Lee's creation. They really work hard to bring up the sci-fi universe with the backdrop of present world. I like the way they take on Wolverine's storyline blended with the main story and actor Hugh Jackman is so perfect for the part. He really looked as the Human version of Sean Chen's comics sketched Wolverine.Also the soul created for X-Men was from legendary music genius Michael Kamen making the immerse of real world in futuristic tones. The other people who steal the show were Rebecca Romijn as shape shifting Mystique, Bruce Davison as Senator Kelly, and Darth Maul-Ray Park as Toad. All other were just OK or not perfect for the part, including old man Ian McKellen, teenage girl Anna Paquin. The Biggest loss occurred was Sabertooth, the movie reduced him to an angry monster even though Tyler Mane was perfect in the role, but the comic book version portrayed the character as a smart villain with animal instinct or someone like the WWE wrestler Triple H persona.I will give this movie 8 out of 10.A great movie that makes a non-fan to read X-Men comics.",8,0,1,5 April 2005
Final Destination 2," A Sequel that went beyond the Original
","I first heard this movie on a news channel. When I saw this movie later, I knew why it was shown in so much important in the news channel. It is an Awesome movie in all means. This mind bulging twisted film rocked me to see the original but Believe me, the first one was just a teenage popcorn movie. This sequel was the greatest and scariest piece which showed true attitudes to the intended universe.Final Destination 2 (Spoilers******) Sequel to the 2000 original movie, director David R. Ellis tells the biggest story which has little to do with the first one. Daddy's girl Kimberly (A.J. Cook) was on her road trip with her friends. On the way she had a vision about an accident going to occur which involves her friends and herself and a six other travelers. Frightened Kimberly stops her car and other vehicles for saving their life. But things went wrong from the next movement. Soon she realize that she made a big mistake by saving them, because they are all now hunted by the Unseen Death! Scripted by J. Mackye Gruber and Erisc Bress for the story of Jeffrey Reddick and themselves tells the phenomenal narration of the greatest hunter Death. It was a kind of wicked work from them for creating a pulsing sequel from the original dull material. A.J. Cook is fabulous, so do Ali Larter. Also the soul created by Shirley Walker was brilliant, it adds tensions when it comes to serious and unexpected situations.All in all it's a great movie in every means. It has outstanding camera works, brilliant editing/FXs and importantly a great story.I gave this movie 10 out of 10Final Destination 2 = Too HOT with IDEAS.",10,1,2,5 April 2005
Predator," 'The Unspeakable Thriller'
","When I first saw this movie I was frightened, I couldn't speak after that. A true Hollywood thriller with a dark sci-fi action dimension.Predator (Spoilers******) Scripted by Jim Thomas and John Thomas tells the thrilling story of a rescue group who were set for tracing down a chopper which was shot down by the Guerrillas in the Central American jungles. During the mission they met with some strange happenings in the jungle. Finally all the members discovers that beyond their targeted enemies there is someone else behind all that strange incidents. What happens when that UNKNOWN starts to HUNT them all, brutally.Originally titled as 'The Hunter', director John McTiernan marks his first big budget movie venture in 'Predator'. A dark horror adventure thriller with the tone of science fiction. McTiernan did his best as a newcomer in Hollywood, by molding a new chapter in cult movies. He made a great balance for telling the struggle of a human against an alien. Arnold did a tremendous work for portraying the helpless mission leader. I like him especially on the last half, huh, seemed like he actually struggling for a help and this convincing aspect of the actor's performance helped maintain the film's awesome cult status.Predator's soul was created masterfully by Alan Silvestri. His score really add tensions to the storytelling. Also the great effort for giving life to Predator came from the late Kevin Peter Hall. Huh his expressions, those swift turns, that body language, that force full movements,I must say, He really lived in that character.Lastly how can any one forget that face of the Predator, the credits goes to one and only Stan Winston. I never see or even imagine such a face in my life, he did a masterpiece work by creating that animatronic ART. Those flickering teeth, sharp eyes, tied hairs, green blood WOW what a creation.All in all it's a great action-adventure thriller, a must see for young males like me. Yeah, if IT BLEEDS We can KILL IT ! I give this movie 8 out of 10. Predator = Exhilarator",8,1,2,25 March 2005
Man of Steel," Total Let Down Movie - Supe In Disaster Porn
","Too much destruction, Too much CGI,Poor dialog,Uninteresting story and characters. Maybe the director & studio wanted to outdone the standard put by Micheal Bay's TRANSFORMERS Films. Even the new Superman theme sucked, Hans Zimmer provided a lame score compared to his iconic theme for BATMAN.Anything good was from Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent. And also the FIRST HALF with stunning VFX scenery. This is totally 70's Superman with steroids. Not a Reboot, just VFX mockery.Yeah I'm done with Superman. Batman got the best reboot in cinematic history, I don't think anything can compare.I give this movie 1 out of 10.",1,16,32,14 June 2013
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Nothing to do with Cameron's Terminator..This is simply A Spin off!
","I don't consider it as a sequel to James Cameron's Terminator. For me the Futuristic-Present sci-fi drama was told completely by the creator in Terminator 2: J D. This movie has not thing to do with the Terminator Franchise.The producers simply make this movie for milking the Stupid Hardcore Terminator Fans. But True Fans like us treat this Spin-off as a funny Forgettable Crape.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (Spoilers******)'T3' is the highly anticipated installment in one of Hollywood's most innovative and celebrated franchises, originated by writer-director James Cameron with the 1984 cult hit The Terminator. With the blockbuster 1991 sequel, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Cameron redefined the science fiction/action film hybrid. This movie was from the minds of John Brancato, Micheal Ferris and Tedi Sarafian. From their story, director Jonathan Mostow raped Cameron's baby, by rechanging the last epic.A decade has passed since John Connor(Nick Stahl) helped prevent Judgment Day - the day Skynet's highly developed network of machines was fated to become self-aware and destroy mankind. But August 29, 1997 came and went without incident, despite Skynet's twice failed attempts to kill Connor and wage war on humanity. Now 22, Connor lives 'off the grid' - no home, no credit cards, no phone and no job. No record of his existence. No way he can be traced by Skynet. Until..Skynet's most sophisticated cyborg killing machine T-X(Kristanna Loken) sent back through time to complete the job left unfinished by her predecessor, the T-1000. And she is exponentially more powerful, dangerous, destructive and beautiful than every Terminator that has come before her. But this time, Connor isn't the only target on Skynet's hit list - unsuspecting veterinarian Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) will see her distant past and promising present collide with an unimaginable future. When Connor and Kate realize that Judgment Day is rocketing toward them - with only three hours between them and the end of the world - their only hope for survival is a replica of the cyborg Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) Connor's mysterious - and now obsolete - former assassin. Together, they must forestall the looming threat of Judgment Day or face the fall of civilization as we know it.!By watching this piece of disaster I thought, for what reason this happened? Did Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna get more Greedy this time? Or Arnold wanted a Cinematic boost before his political debut?First of all absence of James Cameron in every sense. His characters were treated badly, the Terminator punch lines were now reduced for comic relief, his visionary world turned upside down. The soul of the movie was seen as a big round hole when it comes to music. The absence of Brad Fiedel, in which the classic 'Clank' sound gives the signature of Terminator, is thrown out in this version. The new replacement for Fiedel (Marco Beltrami) was the worst part after Mostow.Without Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong, or even William Wisher Jr. (Cameron's co-writer) director Jonathan Mostow managed to bring a Science Fiction tale in a greater level and fails miserably. The early draft storyline was John Connor as a successful computer programmer, who ends up being instrumental in the activation of Skynet. Nick Stahl tried his best to bring up the matured John Connor who transformed as savior of the world but was not convincing. The Strength of all Terminator movies was that they had a strong villain but this one break that rule. The neither TX character nor Kristanna Loken has the charisma of the Dark Force which was portrayed powerfully by Robert Patrick & Arnold in the Original movies.The only strength to the movie was Arnold himself even though he agreed to do this lame chapter. Please don't do another Terminator movie!I give this movie 0 out of 10.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines = Terminator For WHAT ?",1,1,3,26 December 2004
Van Helsing," Another Hollywood Crap
","You want to get Worst of the Worst from a Movie. Watch Stephen Somers directed Val Helsing. Worst plot, worst story telling, worst side kick, worst villain, worst female lead, worst chemistry, worst costumes, worst CGI, Worst Dracula and above all the worst Spin-off ever happened in the movie history.Van Helsing (Spoilers******)Set in 19th Century London, Rome, Paris and Transylvaniawhere mankind is in constant danger from evil in different forms only one man fights for the human race. He is the Vampire hunter Van Helsing(Hugh Jackman).After an encounter with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde he went for a mission in Transylvania with his side kick Carl (David Wenham) who makes him James Bond style weapons, of course made with that period technology. In Transylvania he has to protect the last member of the Valerious family Anna, played by beautiful Kate Beckinsale. But for that he must stand against Dracula.Oh and also..He must fight against The Werewolf, The Frankenstein monster, Dracula's bloodthirsty Bridesand finally get the girl from the villain. That's it, that's the story - The Ultimate Spin-off of the century.The only simplest thing that went wrong in this movie was the director, who failed to give any importance for the Story. Also the CGI which played an important part in this movie, looked OVERDONE. The iconic characters showcased as Cartoon like figures as we already seen in Mummy Returns (Rock as the Scorpion King), Matrix Reloaded (Neo fights with multiple Agents).Background score is so weak that we will not remember the theme after an hour.And the most disgraced thing in this movie was The Dracula, such a legendary role was ruined by actor Richard Roxburgh. His version of lethally Un-seductive, Russian slang Count Dracula was the worst Dracula ever seen in the Hollywood history. Even my young brother couldn't understand that he was playing Dracula.Only strength in the movie is Logan ! Yes, Hugh Jackman in this movie is just standing out there, without any Good inputs. We see him as Van Helsing only because he had the tough guy image of Wolverine. Failing miserably, for presenting any attitudes to Van Helsing.When I look back the whole movie, it was like an uncontrolled Roller Coaster. All actions, all the mess, all underplayed humors, all the screams.O.K notable features of this movie.1) Transformation of Wolfman that was really eye popping movement.2) Shuler Hensley as Frankenstein's Monster He gave a realistic emotional part to this legendary character.3) By knowing that it is a bad script Stephen Somers's guts to direct the movie.Hey this movie is not that much bad as The Hulk. See this if you want to waste some good time of your life.I give this movie 1 out of 10.Van Helsing = Walk Out",1,0,3,17 July 2004
Face_Off," ' The Modern Classic '
","Like I said, it's a classic, a modern classic. A great action movie that combines the Asian themes in American style. I doubt when would we see another action movie as excellent as Face/Off. A film that brilliantly blends action and plot in an equalized harmony.Face/Off (Spoilers******)Directed by acclaimed Honk Kong director John Woo who famous for his artistic violent and action sequences brings this complicated story about Human identity. This revolutionary action/sci-fi story was written by Mike Werb and Michael Colleary. It was originally set in the future and marked to be the first action vehicle for the two BOX OFFICE HEAVY WEIGHTS ARNOLD and STALLONE to star together. But it was later altered, the sci-fi element was changed into the present time and the casting was redone after Woo approached the film.Six years ago the terrorist Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) attempted to kill Sean Archer (John Travolta), a vengeful FBI agent and it resulted in the brutal murder of Archer's young son. Since then the hunt for Troy has not only been a part of Archer's job, it's also been personal. Now, finally and after the loss of many men, Archer takes Troy in custody by knocking him into a coma. Archer's quest then ended but with a new turn, he learns of a biochemical bomb that Troy has planted somewhere in downtown L.A. How can Archer possibly locate the bomb and prevent it from taking out an entire city street?With Troy in a coma and his cohorts unwilling to talk, Archer is convinced by his colleagues that there's only one way to uncover Troy's plan--Archer must become Troy.Through supreme, state of the art surgery, Archer can assume the actual face of the now comatose Castor Troy, go undercover in prison where Troy's brother (Allesandro Nivola) is being held, and gain information from him. Archer disagrees with this plan, especially wearing the face of the man who killed his son. But someone has to take that step, someone who knows everything about Troy and the only man who knows him better was Archer and thus he agrees to the assignment, and transformed into Castor Troy himself and went for the mission. Unfortunately in the police lab, the real Castor Troy awakes from his coma, shocked to find that what they have done with his face. That makes him to take the face of Archer, destroying the police lab, killing the authorities and all evidence that proves who Archer really is. Thus in this side the terrorist is now the FBI man, and decides to mess up everything in a new form!The rest of the story was just amazing-mind blowing. When we see each transformed character on the screen we just immerse in the swapped character portrayal of each, rather than the two different actors who play them. Travolta and Cage did a tremendous work by copying off each others acting style and mannerisms which all makes it a more interesting and thrilling chapter. They just heavenly live on each body, as villain and as hero, forcing the audience to constantly pay attention not only to the face they see on screen, but the personality underneath it.And all the credit goes to brilliance of John Woo. An emotionally complicated story of two different persons as each character struggles with their own identities when the boundaries between 'the good guy' and 'the bad guy' become blurred. It was his idea to cast John Travolta and Nicolas Cage for those challenging role which was originally intended for Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone in a futuristic world sci-fi thriller.John Woo covered that sci-fi story sides with a more human touch. That makes the movie a better intriguing psychological thriller, than a usual action flick. He combined the original plot with his talented story telling styles in an American way. His trademarks the slow-motion, firing guns, flying doves, business suite with sun glass all match up with the story. My favorite scene is (Cage) Troy praying in the church before the final shootout.A great touching movie beyond that of a usual action flick.I give this movie 10 out of 10!Face/Off = FACE DOWN.",10,3,5,14 February 2005
Quantum of Solace," Makes 'Casino Royale' Good
","I became a fan of the new rebooted franchise of Bond after watching the original Casino Royale in 2006(I even watched it in the first-day first-show). I think that movie really made Bond character a more human, compared to all that previous visual gimmicks garbage eggs. I liked the actor Daniel Craig's interpretation of 'Strong and Silent' brutal Bond which the original author Ian Fleming envisioned. When I heard EON production planning for a sequel I was greatly excited.Fast forward, present day NOV-7-2008, all that excitement I gained after watching, surfing, downloading the news, trailers, articles of BOND 22 from preproduction to its early release, ended when I witness the sequel in the theatre.Quantum of Solace. (***SPOLIERS***) After the murder of Vesper, Bond became more aggressive to trace out the true killers responsible for her death. This time he happens to know that it is Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric), and to get him Bond has to go threw a wide cycle of events with the help of a girl named Camille (Olga Kurylenko).Picking up almost an hour after the ending events of Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace is the first true Bond sequel happened in the James Bond franchise. Based on an original idea by producer Michael G. Wilson, director Marc Forster tells the continuing story of the world's greatest secret agent.But the problem for this rebooted sequel is, first of all it doesn't feel like a thrilling movie or even a sequel because of the lame storyline and lagging plot expansion. The art film director Marc Forster doesn't even come close to the average Martin Campbell with his lame narration techniques. Originally intended to show Bond as realistic as possible, this director portrayed the action scene with unrealistic camera movements for CGI fight doubles and even copied the outstanding free-running sequence from Casino Royale. Or was it because of the bad script written by screenwriters Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Paul Haggis. Anyway it all sucked. No wonder why major directors like Roger Michell, Tony Scott, Alex Proyas, Jonathan Mostow declined to shoot this sequel with that draft. Even the opening credits looked pathetic.Daniel Craig did his best as Bond even with a bad script; he showed he can hold on. His interpretation of Bond as a antihero more than a hero was prefect in this movie. Even without a good plot or great dialogues or a threatening villain, Daniel Craig proved he can play Bond as bold as ever. On the other hand antagonist Mathieu Amalric downplayed the character and appeared less alarming to Bond.Second heroine Gemma Arterton was wasted all way long, so was Jeffrey white. Anything good was from Olga Kurylenko who captured the true essence of the Bond Girl. I became a fan after watching her outing with AGENT 47 in Hit-man, in this movie pairing with AGENT OO7 showed a new side of this talented actress. Plus, the stunt coordinator Gary Powell of Casino Royale and Dan Bradley the second unit director of Bourne film series, really deserves credits for bringing Bond realistic as possible. They showed their talents in creating the breath taking action sequences, especially the first car chasing and the rooftop fighting.And also the soul given by David Arnold finally made an impact in this movie. I hated all his previous scores in bond films including Casino Royale, but this score heard in the movie really gave a true identity to the new serious Bond. Truly this is the Best Bond Score ever! All in all this is a movie which should have made better, but completely went wrong by hiring terrible director. EON producers better give importance to the preproduction, and please give Daniel a new long haircut in the coming sequel. I'm giving this movie 3 out of 10!

","I wanted to see an epic clash of two Horror icons, but what I got was a 3 hour National Geographic documentary.Alien Vs Predator (Spoilers******) The most awaited movie of the life time which features the famous characters created by Dan O'Bannon, Ronald Shusett and Jim Thomas, John Thomas. Alien and Predator both characters were well established and have a huge fans following, but a film that features both of them in one frame failed to satisfies the True Fans. Lack of Action, Thrills, Suspense, SFX make this lame chapter a CRAP. Director plus writer Paul W.S. Anderson didn't know how treat this EPIC EVENT into a memorable one. Using unknown actors and sucking back drops makes this movie reduced into a cheap documentary one.Predator in the movie sucked a lot because of the way the movie crafted the Alien. Producers tried to blend the ideas from Video Games, Comics and previous movies making the viewers a brainless Rat. It's also because of that sucking Paul Anderson, what ever he does SUCKS at the next second. He wrote Blade 3 it sucked, he wrote this movie it sucked, and he is writing the new Batman its going to be SUCKED. At least he should have seen Freddy Vs Jason! Go and watch if you want to loose money and time.Alien Vs Predator = Aligned Weak Portions.",2,1,2,5 April 2005
Batman Begins," I expected the Crape, But not that much !!!!!
","First of all am of age 23, outside from the Hi-Tech Western world. I usually comment on movies which I liked or hated the most. But for this particular movie I had to wait around two months, not for judging its moral/creative content, but for forgiving myself for not using any harsh words.I have seen all Batman adaptations up to 90's Batman Beyond cartoon series. I liked Tim Burton's Batman movie but don't fully agree with it, I liked it only because it paved the way to 'Batman Animated Series' the only artistic work that revised Bob Kane's original concept. I rather consider it as the only Bible for Bob Kane's great character Batman. But for commenting this movie, I am stepping out from the die-hard fan point of view and speaking from a normal viewer's mind.Batman Begins (Spoilers******) After 'Batman and Robin' Warner Bros. was in a confused state whether to continue the vitiate franchise further or not. With new executives they tried to negotiate with the franchise with edged spin-offs, nothing went production wise. So they choose another path, restarting the whole franchise and now the problem is, the director. Warner Bros. early approached Clint Eastwood, Wolfgang Petersen, Darren Aronofsky and then to my favorite David Fincher. They even approached Wachowski Brothers, the hot Warner products at that time but nothing happened.Finally after every noted Hollywood directors walked away from the picture Warner Bros. were forced to give the franchise to a foreign hand. It was the British art film director Christopher Nolan; who done his debut Hollywood movie few years back. The moment he touched the project, every thing went up side down. To make things even worse, writer David S. Goyer who worked as generator operator on Nolan's 'Insomnia' teamed up with him to make a new milestone.The movie begins with a young Bruce Wayne who discovers the fear of Bats for the first time. This fear made him to loose his beloved parents; and the guilty in him leads the adult Bruce (Christian Bale) to leave the country. In the path to salvation Bruce travels across the world as an ordinary man until he was jailed by the Himalayan guards. It was then he meets Ducard (Liam Neeson) who make him to be a member of 'League of Shadows', a secret dark organization owned by Ra's al Ghul (Ken Watanabe). But things went wrong when Bruce violated the rules of the Shadows and was forced to end his quest, making a decision to go back to his home town Gotham.Only one problem arise; Will the new Bruce finally identify with the Gotham city he once left off, or can the Gotham city recognize the new Bruce Wayne.Written by David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan tells the reinventing story of Batman as well as the young Bruce Wayne. I can't believe it was written from the sucking David Goyer who done the Wesley Snipes' Blade franchise. But dialogue wise it sucks because of corny, misused, one sided character placement lines. The treatment was set to be well paced but the director's interpretation made it a dreadful one.Nolan is the director, so I don't want to speak about the visualization of this movie, it's an art film, sucking camera works of Wally Pfister and inimical editing of Lee Smith was really from Nolan's idea. Nolan changed everything; Batman's appearance were changed, his Batmobile beefs up, Gotham city got elevated trains and above all, the new Batman is Bisexual. Who cast Christian Bale as Batman; He looked like a born Gay person, with his thin blade lips, vulgar smiles, all made Bruce Wayne, as well as Batman to a chicken level man. He remembered me of the first sucking Batman Adam West. He didn't succeed even in representing the two separate aspects of the same person, at least in the vocals (which was done brilliantly by the voice-over actor Kevin Conroy in Animated Series).The rest of the cast sucked, anything good was from Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon; also Mark Boone Junior done a great performance as the frustrated officer Flass, when considering with original characters. Ken Watanabe failed to create a good impression because of his little screen time and ridicules makeup appearance which doesn't resembles to Ra's Al Ghul in the original titles.O.K if these all things went wrong, there was one probability that would have saved this movie and that was its soul, the music. I was spellbound when I heard Hans Zimmer was going to score for the new franchise and also teaming for the first time, with versatile composer James Newton Howard. I really wanted to see how his version going to clash with classical Elfman's theme. All my expectation shattered when I heard the musical score from the movie, it really sucked, a terribly frustrating failure. Till now I can't figure it out, what was Batman's new theme score? Nolan would have stick with his usual collaborator David Julyan, at least for bringing a taint look in Wayne's duality.All in all it's truly a dreadful experience to watch the entire movie. We can clearly see the failed attempt from an art film maker to bring an action film, with his own twisted visions. With the shades of Chinese Ninja movies blundered with classical James Bond movies, Nolan failed to deliver what the non/true-fans really waited for; Warner Bros would have given this movie at least to some kid from MTV for directing the most anticipated franchise.

The Transporter," ' Truly The Millennium's Action movie, and NEXT LEVEL ACTION STAR '
","When I first decided to watch this movie I thought it's going to be a usual Hollywood/Hong Kong action crap with some Rated nude scenes. But what I got was a GEM!!!!! After the end of 90's and the decline of ARNOLD-STALLONE presence, Hollywood was really going for ACTOR oriented movies than ACTION oriented HEAVY WEIGHTS (which is Good by the Way). In an arena now starving for ACTION STARS, this movie really redefines the Golden-age Action Films and makes the answer for the NEXT LEVEL ACTION HEROES.Directed by Louis Leterrier and Corey Yuen, tells the story of a man who makes a living with the delivery of illegal things.The Transporter (Spoilers******) After ending the military carrier Frank Martine (Jason Statham) is now in the field of smuggling. A disciplined, solo professional who transports criminal materials in his BMW for the outlaw customers. He has strict rules for his service which makes the Transporter a noted name in the crime world.But things went wrong when he got a new assignment, to transport a package which happened to be a lovely Asian girl(Qui Shu).Scripted by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen tells the Hard Hitting Fast Paced story of The Transporter - Frank Martine. A great structured screenplay for an action movie, which also blended with another dimension of Underworld and Romance. Tremendous camera works, enriched with in the fast cutting editing which really demanded in the movie. Credit goes to camera team of Pierre Morel and the visionary editor Nicolas Trembasiewicz.Both the vehicle and the physical stunts were done brilliantly. Fight was well choreographed by Film Director Corey Yuen and the Stunt performers rocked in each frame. The man who steal the show Jason Statham, his portrayal of Strong and Silent - Good Bad Man was the best thing in the movie. I wish he would appear as 'Agent 47' if Edidos game company brings their Hit-man titles as movies, he will LIVE in that character. Plus lovely lady Qui Shu was really treat for eyes in every frames.All and all it's a great movie which stands in the Top of high rated Action titles. A true action movie of the 2000's.I give this movie 10 out of 10 !The Transporter = Action movie with a defined dimension.",10,0,1,21 March 2005
Hellboy," ' Beyound What I Expected '
","I was totally unknown to this comic book character. When I saw this movie I was swept away by it's tone. It remembered those 90's when I first saw Batman.Hellboy (Spoilers******) Based on the comic book series by Mike Mignola, legendary director Guillermo del Toro brings the tale of an usual demon named Hellboy. Del Toro who was famous for his movies like Mimic, Blade 2 takes a new turn in his carrier by following the supernatural adventures of Hellboy (Ron Perlman), a cigar-chomping, horn-filing demonic hero who enlisted to fight evil under the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense. It's an undercover government organization where freaks with special powers are raised to fight for good causes.One such freakish character is Hellboy, a mammoth with horns who was bred by Nazis to unleash evil upon the planet. But under the care of the father-like leader Trevor Bruttenholm, Hellboy is resists attempts to lure him back to the dark side and fights on the behalf of an oblivious society.But the question is how long? A great movie from the Revolution studios. Scripted by Guillermo del Toro for the story of Peter Briggs and himself, makes the most successful transformation from pulp page to big screen since Tim Burton's Batman in 1989. The story was well written and the way it was treated in the cinematic means was excellent. All credits goes to Guillermo del Toro. It is the best movie from him.Emotions, narrations, actions, the creativity all are in the perfect balance. Ron Perlman as Hellboy might be the best casting ever of a superhero...he's cooler than the movie. I recall when I found that he was playing Hellboy I thought, what the hell an aged Grandpa doing a superhero action role..it SUCKS! But my thoughts were blown away by his Performance. Wow a great work.He was born to play Hellboy. He makes me to say he is the Mega, excellent actor than a superstar. His grittiness, rough humor, attitudes, sadness make that character unique. Also I was moved by the mannerisms of Doug Jones as Abe Sapien, also his voiced actor Mr. David Hyde Pierce. It was a stunning visual when Abe was under water.Both the principal photography and post production teams done a great work in this movie. The creatures, explosions, sceneries were so real in both fast cutting and in close up shots. They build the perfect tone for this movie.Also the soul of the movie was created masterfully by Marco Beltrami. He injects the mood with his largely orchestral and choral cues that builds up the substantial base. No questions with out that score Hellboy could be a lame chapter. Guillermo del Toro makes the right decision by reuniting with Marco Beltrami. It was his greatest score compared to his early works.All in all it is a great movie with some touching scenes. My favorite scenes are Hellboy's last look on his father's funeral in the rain, were it's difficult to see whether it was his tears or the rain drops from his eyes. Also the marvelous ending scene with the narration and the eye popping opening credit ('Mr.Karin Fong I loved that opening title, you are the best in title designing').I give this movie 10 out of 10!Hellboy=OH, BOY!",10,1,2,22 February 2005
Mission: Impossible II," ' Original's Damaged Version '
","I was almost blown away by watching Brian Da Palma's first Mission Impossible in 1996 only by it's story telling. When I knew there was a second story coming and this time from acclaimed director John Woo, I went Upside Down. But when I saw this anticipated sequel, all that expectations 'self destructed' in no seconds.First of all Cruise is a damaged Hollywood actor, bounded in his 'super stardom'. For keeping his melting stardom he produced this sequel by disfiguring the creativity of Mr.Woo, making him to do things Beyond the LINES.Mission Impossible 2 (Spoilers******) Sequel to the 1996 movie, this time IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has been sent on a mission to retrieve and destroy the supply of a genetically created virus called 'Chimera'. For this he must trace down Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) by his ex-girl friend Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton). Things went wrong when an affair started to happen between Nyah and Hunt.Scripted by veteran Hollywood screenwriter Robert Towne for the story of Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga, this movie moves with Romance, Tensions, and Actions. The STORY got nothing to contribute to the movie 'cause much of the script was incorporated around action scenes that director John Woo envisioned.But his version was corrupted by TOM CRUISE's involvement, yes, Tom Cruise is the producer, so that means he must be portrayed as larger than God like character. Don't know What the hell Tom wanted from this movie. Cruise kept encouraging additional invention, wanting Woo to make things higher, wider, and faster. So we must see MI2 as an ACTION vehicle designed for Cruise, to his own specifications. Even after such draw backs John Woo managed to gave his best for this movie. His stylized camera works, slow motions, plus fast cutting chasing action scenes. Especially the pigeon flying over Ethan when he appears from the fire flames, dialogues like 'Just stay alive, I am not going to loose you', and that watery slow motion jumps. No one can capture that poetic movements except Woo.Also the soul of the movie was created by Hans Zimmer. Not over than Danny Elfman's previous score, but it suits with the fast cutting tones. Hans Zimmer did a good job for providing a respected score with authentic flamenco styles with heavy metal action cues for this messy film.All in all it's a great movie if we can forget the previous one. Cruise sucked in every crucial points in the movie, in interviews he even claimed that he did all his stunts. Then what was stunt guys Keith Campbell and Ron Kauk doing in the mountains, why Jimmy N. Roberts and Matt Mingay credited for motor cycles stunt doubles? Mr. Super G*Y want to fool us.Only thing happened good in the movie was its production conflicts and delays. Because of that, Dougray Scott had to give up his upcoming movie X-Men. And that role went to Mr. Hugh Jackman. O my GOD! What would have happened if the movie finished at the correct schedule in Australia? Huh, a great loss for the Australians and rest of the world (Jackman was from Australia and I can't assume any one in the place of Logan, he is the perfect Wolverine for the X-Men movie) I give this movie 1 out of 10!M I :2 = A Good Wrong Movie.",1,1,2,11 March 2005
Avatar," James Cameron's Mockery of WALT Disney Movies !
","First of all I am a great fan of James Cameron, and I went to see this movie with great expectation. But very sorry to say that, what I got was a total pathetic version of mediocre VFX-LOVE-DRAMA-STRUGGLE movie.When I am writing this comment, all those great memories coming into my mind, that first Script Treatment for Avatar I read from the Internet years ago. All those images and there happenings in the script envisioned, went totally upside down when it was finally filmed.Set in the future 2154 the story starts with a man named Jake Sully a paraplegic former marine, who lost his twin brother and arrives on planet/moon Pandora to replace his brother's assignment in the Avatar program. What is an Avatar? Basically the term taken from Hindu Religion which means incarnation of one of the Hindu Gods taking a flesh form. But in the movie it stands for injecting a human's intelligence into another remotely located biological body. IE, On Pandora the superior life forms (much like humans) are called Na'vis very tall, lean, blue skinned, big eyed creatures with tails. Since humans cannot breathe Pandora's atmosphere, scientists have created human-na'vi hybrid bodies called Avatars. So they may easily interact with the na'vi and na'vi address them as Dream-walkers.Things went wrong when Jake took his Avatar form in a much more emotional level.As a VFX student/artist myself, yes Cameron done a great work. It's the first time the Notorious 'Uncanny Valley' effect (A viewer intelligence to find unrealistic human characteristics in a CGI Object)failed in the big Screen. The VFX characters never looked so realistic or more precisely looked 'PEOPLE in BLUE RUBBER MASK'. Total achievement in Visual Effects standard point, the Sound editing, Animation, perfect in all sense. Even tough, personally I think the main character design of Na'vi's looked pathetic, especially that blue color, but hey it's Cameron's favorite color tone.But the problem in the Avatar is the whole story, JC worked so much in this project for years, but he lost in polishing it, mainly because he concentrated his energy on the VFX side and it can be seen in the whole picture. The major movements in the movie made me Deja Vu, especially that romantic pairs Forest scenes directly taken from Major Walt Disney Animated movies like TARZAN, SPIRIT STALLION OF THE CIMARRON and exactly from FERNGULLY THE LAST RAINFOREST.And let face it, Cameron is not good at Sissy girly melodrama stuffs so we find mediocre weak dialog, awkward love scenes through out the movie, and I can understand that he's a SCIFI LEGEND not a Woody Allen! ( In Terminator he got help from his uncredited co-writer William Wisher for Sarah Conner's dialog.) If he had left off the romantic angle the movie could have been much better, or may be he just added to make it more DRAMATIC. But the whole story suffered a 'WALT Disney Taste' because of that.Also the music by James Horner was annoying especially in the humor scenes, it sounded stupid and lame. Cameron should choose some one with more integrity and soul like Hans Zimmmer or James Howard Newton. The war cue and the main theme is so forgettable, he should have given his dream project to his usual collaborator Brad Fiedel.And the cast assembled for this movie was so bad especially the main lead actor Sam Worthington with his dumb voice accent and screen presence I wish to crush my 3D glass. Cameron should give chances to black actors. Anything came good was from Giovanni Ribisi as the aggressive corporate administrator with less screen time. And also Zoe Saldana was interesting with the 'ACTOR DRIVEN PERFORMANCE', also must give credits to the animators and VFX crew. But the most threatening shot I found in this VFX Glowed movie was Sam Worthington realistic poliomyelitis legs done in CGI/Prosthetic practical FX. The Less FX is Much enough, Cameron should know that Rule and should never go to the roots of George Lucas. And I must say the whole Three D experience was not good as I expected, I should have went for the normal theater, this one hurt my eyes and enjoyment.All in all this is not the Avatar I anticipated, I imagined a far more a intriguing vision from the Terminator Director. What I got was a James Cameron's Mockery of Walt Disney movies. You will enjoy it if you are new to Hollywood Epics, but as an experienced movie watcher I give this movie 3 out of 10. Only because 1) James Cameron directed THE ABYSS! 2) James Cameron directed TERMINATOR!! 3) James Cameron directed TITANIC!!!Avatar = Walt Disney Movies on Steroids.",3,4,13,29 December 2009
From Hell," Expectations Failed
","After watching a documentary based on Jack the Ripper in the History Channel made me to check this movie. But what I got was pathetic art film it was just a mediocre adaptation of a comic book.From Hell (Spoilers******) 20th Century Fox brings the cinematic version of the graphic novel written by Alan Moore. England during 1888 a mysterious killer starts to murder poor prostitutes, for searching him Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp) was brought to the case. Even after his strict surveillance the killer continues to hunt down more prostitutes. Things went more darker when a young prostitute named Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) enters Abberline's life. Soon Abberline found that each victim was connected and the killer was some one from the Royal Family.Directed by the Hughes brothers (Allen and Albert) tells the unseen story of the notorious killer Jack the Ripper. I don't know why they treat such hard core theme to a sucking art film. It has no tension, no forcefulness, and no suspense. Or is that because of they feared Alan Moore's creativity, or a NC-17 rating, they cheated all the die hard fans by creating such lame movies based on a Great materials.I give this movie 1 out of 10.From Hell = Dull Hell.",1,2,5,5 April 2005

Thank God I watched it in the Pirated CD. This movie was supposed to be an action adventure puzzling thriller, but the weak screenplay made that venture to something else. It has weak motives, large loop holes, lame tensions and over all it questions viewer's IQ!

War of the Worlds," Sucking Spielberg Aping Devlin/Roland Emmerich
","First of all am not from America and I am of age 23. As a child I loved amazing movies from Hollywood and now, I simply hate them! This movie reinvented my hatred towards sucking Hollywood NO-BRAINERS Sci-fi movies, only because over-exploited director Spielberg and his new disgusting partner Tom Cruise.War of the Worlds (Spoilers******) Based on the great classic visionary writer H.G. Wells' novel 'The War of the Worlds' which is best known for the historic 1938 Orson Welles radio broadcast in which Welles deviously convinced much of the nation that our planet was actually under attack, for such an high brilliant subject the new age Hollywood adaptation turned to be a sucking disaster when the movie rights was took up by the producer Tom Cruise and his new team partner Steven Spielberg.Re-changing the original work upside down the screen-story begins with a middle wage industrial worker Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) who was taken the custody of his two children Robbie (Justin Chatwin) and Rachel (Dakota Fanning) from his ex-wife for a few days. Children seemed upset under their biological father's custody only because he is not wealthy as their mother's new boyfriend. But things went wrong when the weather goes bad and they really had to go through more disgusting moments with their dad, more than they expected.Scripted by David Koepp tells the counterfeit version of H.G. Wells's novel in a destitute manner, only to incorporate Tom Cruise execrable acting talents. And Spielberg made that thing even bigger by giving more importance to this gay/bisexual 'Cruise' man than the story itself. He forgot it was written by H.G. Wells and must be made as a great masterpiece. He blew out his chance and we see a poor aped version of ' Roland Emmerich/ Dean Devlin ' from Spielberg, through out the movie.Also the soul of the movie from legendary John Williams failed to create a meaningful score for a sci-fi masterpiece novel. May be because he might have known that the movie itself has no meaning, when it was created entirely different from Wells's version.All in all it's a dreadful experience to watch the entire movie, I recommend better skip the portions when Tom Cruise comes to screen with his overrated acting skills, better watch it in a pirated CD. I don't know why they make such films after 9/11 without any point. Spielberg must change his carrier to a second unit director. 'I would give this movie 1 out of 10'!

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Hollywood 'Mahaabaaratham' finally came to an End
","First of all I am not from America and thank God, am not a Star Wars Super Freak. This is my first comment to a Star War movie. Even though I don't like the original Star Wars movies, and hates its new prequels, I wanted to watch the 'last epic event' in theaters. This was my first Star War movie (and probably the last one) I ever watched on a theater, because I was not born on the original trilogy times and was un-attracted to the new prequels.I was thrilled to watch the last chapter, the birth of Dark Vader (even though I don't consider him as a 'great villain of all times') and also wanted to be a part on the historical event, I went to theaters on the opening weekend. But what I got was a totally lamed nuisance.Star Wars Episode 3 - Revenge of the Sith (Spoilers******) Directed by George Lucas tells the last tale of his acclaimed Saga. This time the anticipation increases as never before because all the previous restarted movies (Episode 1 and 2), where done for this last dark chapter. It is the story of a boy called Anakin became the evil man called Darth Vader and the final transformation comes in this Episode.Written by George Lucas himself, the story was well placed but the director in him makes it as a dreadful one. First of all the extreme violent use of his company-ILM's special effects. It was a sucking nuisance for both eyes and ears, but if he wanted to make his own Hindu Mythological 'Mahaabaaratham' who wants to stop him.Secondly the lack of drama, emotions. The story lacks passionate, memorable scenes a last epic must definitely have. It has no intense dialogue delivery as I expected and the available ones resembles to some British theatrical dramas.Thirdly and mostly, the lack of good action scenes. This closing chapter has no dramatic fighting scenes; all the battles presented were spoiled or reduced due to miss use of SFX team. Shame for the stunt choreographers for not bringing something great, good new sharp ideas, where as in 'Phantom Menace' the final fight between Ray Park/Darth Maul and the two Jedi was extreme and well filmed.And last but not the least, the soul created by John Williams was maimed due to the story telling, even Anakin's final transform to Vader happened before the first half than the last five minutes, it could have been a great experience. But Lucas again accomplished his twisted vision by reducing the birth of Dark Vader in nearly the closing of movie, thereby reducing thematic diversion of the story, huh a major mistake.Even so, we can hear acclaimed James Earl Jones's breathing sound in the final moments as the new born Darth Vader. Also Hayden Christensen rocked in the last moments as the new David Prowse/Darth Vader! even though he messed most of his part as Anakin Skywalker. The most sucking performance was from Samuel L. Jackson, what he thought of himself, he sucks the most in the whole Star War Franchise after Harrison Ford. I mean who cast him as a Jedi, he looks like a black pimp in that costume, I can't imagine a black person as a Jedi even though 'am not a racist.Anything good in this movie was from Ewan McGregor, he finally gave his best performance for the trilogy. He reminded me Mark Hamill's portrayal of helpless Luke Skywalker. Also Ian McDiarmid did a great job as Emperor Palpatine as well as Darth Sidious even though his transformation to the Dark side didn't contemplate much as I envisioned.All in all it's a good movie all hankered for but ends up like a sucking nuisance, harmful to both eyes and ears, better watch it in a pirated CD.

Back to the Future Part II," Hmmm..OOoo.. Why, Why they made it
","Can't..I..can't.. I can't really comment on this movie, because I am a huge fan the First movie. The Original was a masterpiece but the sequel which revisits the first didn't have that potential of its predecessor; I am assuming it never happened.Back to the Future 2 (Spoilers******) After the sensational movie 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' director Robert Zemeckis was thinking for another hit. But he doesn't know what next, until he thinks of his own ONE AND ONLY best block buster 'Back to the Future'. After the original creator Bob Gale given a nice story which was set up in the 1960's, Zemeckis decided to make it in another way messing all of them around, insulting the first movie and he finally succeeds. And that was 'Back to the Future'- Part II and III.Marty was forced to go to the future, in which he discovers that he can be a millionaire if he takes a sports magazine to his original time slot. But later his idea was taken by old Biff who steals the time traveling car and went to 1955. Will Marty this time smart enough to take up the challenge. If so how? Scripted by Bob Gale for the story of Robert Zemeckis and himself, revisits the original film from different angles with the two Martys in 1955. The movie is far from the original but Michael J. Fox makes it to be in touch. He has done a brilliant performance. Especially in those 1955 scenes with the Biff and early Marty. Even though the script was bad, the actors tried to cover the story's defects with their talents. Christopher Lloyd, Mary Steenburgen and Thomas F. Wilson did their nice work, they really saved the movie.I missed Crispin Glover as George McFly the most, but Jeffrey Weissman did his best to become Crispin Glover as well as George McFly! It was Crispin's departure that made the writers to change the movie this way, but Zemeckis had a chance to make it well, but he blew it anyway.. bending into another stupid sequel.All in all its a great miss and a great won for the previous movie fans, but in deeply, truly a Big disaster for a Great fan like me.'I gave this movie 0 out of 100!'",1,4,28,26 May 2005
Signs," A Good Movie Experience with a Difference
","I first saw this movie in a pirated CD and later on TV channels. I have to warn you, on each viewing this film will make everyone to 'FALL in LOVE' with the Story!Signs(Spoilers******) Indian born director M. Night Shyamalan takes his next boogie venture this time his story revolves round the strange circles appears on the corn fields. Ex-Rev. Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is now interested on agriculture after his wife died on a car accident. Giving up his belief on God, Graham is living a new life with his two children and his brother (Joaquin Phoenix). One day he finds some strange circles on his crop fields, soon realizing that it's some kind of Alien signs. Why such signs appear on his field, does it have any thing to do with his past days? Scripted by M. Night Shyamalan himself tells the thrilling story of Aliens intrusion with a backdrop of strange crop signs. As always Shyamalan movies have something to say, it also gives messages like all Things Happens For Good, Believe in God. Mel Gibson was tremendous in portraying the torched family man. Gladiator-Joaquin Phoenix did an outstanding performance as Gibson's younger brother, whenever he was on screen the viewers get some relief, he was best in creating a pleasant atmosphere in an art movie. Plus the other person who steal the show was little girl Abigail Breslin, she was a an angel in the movie, but the boy Rory Culkin sucked his part by portraying a Too serious 10 year old.The camera works were good also the masterful editing. Credit goes to works of Tak Fujimoto and Barbara Tuliver. Last but not least the soul for Signs created by James Newton Howard makes this movie a cult classical one. Such a thrilling hunting Disturbing score that pushes Suspense and Pace in a well balanced way is totally unique.Watch this movie for a peaceful time of Horror. It's not disturbing, it's just feels good if you have enough sense to think.' I give this movie 8 out of 10 'Signs = Simply An Intelligent Movie",8,0,2,5 April 2005
Speed," The only ' Over the EDGE ' movie Ever Happened
","Those mid 90's, that were the time I became a Hollywood action movie fan. I saw this film in my video recorder first, but it blew me out even in that small screen. I wondered what could have I experienced if I seen it on the silver screen. At that time I have seen lot of action movies that fascinated me, excited me but this movie stands alone from them for its unique transversal versatility.Speed (Spoilers******) After the box-office disaster of Arnold's 'Last Action Hero' major studios were thinking Hollywood Action Movie Era has ended, making Paramount pictures to switch off from the 'Bomb Squad Action Thriller'. But 20th Century Fox takes their own risk to change that equation by hiring a foreign film director.Director Jan de Bont brings the new defined version of thriller action with a different tone. He got tight script, good studio, great crew and fine actors for his cinematic experience. Story of a young officer Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) who got twisted with his new arch enemy Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper), an ex-bomb squad officer whose plane was once demolished by Traven. In his second chance Howard tantalize Traven by telling the next attack was targeted on a bus, and the bomb will set when it speeds greater than 50 mph. What will he do next, will he track down the mad bomber or does he save the civilians? Written by Graham Yost, enhanced by Joss Whedon, tells the exciting paced venture thriller. The screenplay was well written, strong and fixed, the director just gave the perfect visualization for story.All credits goes to the production team, from the principal photography team under Andrzej Bartkowiak to the editing works of John Wright, everything was perfect for this movie experience. Plus the soul of the movie, the music created by Mark Mancina and John Van Tongeren was masterful for this chapter. Without Mancina's theme I don't think the movie could have been that successful, it was so punching, pulse pounding. And the actors, Keanu Reeves-the real life 'Neo', he showed his first matured manly portrayal in this movie, and Sandra Bullock relay smooths this intense film with her presence. And also Joe Morton, how can I miss him, it was one of his greatest roles after T2: Judgment day's 'Miles Dyson'. The major miss was from Dennis Hopper and Jeff Daniels, one was misused and other was wasted respectively.All in all it's a wonderful extreme movie that an action loving male like me must not miss.Speed = The Deep.",8,0,1,16 June 2005
X2: X-Men United," '2 is good, but 1 WAS better, a lot better'
","I watched this movie, first time it was excellent, for the second time it was good, for the third it was O.K and for the rest it went awful! It miss something from the original, sorry I don't know why.X2: X-Men United (Spoilers******) Sequel to the 2000 original movie,'X2' is the highly anticipated installment from Bryan Singer who forges ahead with his work, this time creating more complexities on the franchise. Based on the popular Marvel comic book series this second exposure was from the minds of Zak Penn, David Hayter and Singer himself.After Magneto was closed in the plastic prison Professor Charles Xavier was quiet busy in teaching his gifted students. The problems against mutant still existing, gets even worse when the President was attacked by a vaporizing mutant (Nightcrawler). The President now take firm look at the mutant issue, this time from the assistance of former U.S. military leader turned anti-mutant radical William Stryker. After seeing the aerial photograph of an unidentified aircraft (X-Jet) from Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, President gives permission to Stryker for trace down the whole area minus any blood shed. For that he meets Magneto, under some nostrum he was forced to give information about Xavier's mansion resulting a secret military operation at the mutant school for catching mutant students. Some are taken prisoner and others become fugitives, along with members of the school's elite team, the X-Men.What will they do next, will that be the beginning of War against Mutants, What will Xavier do to save mutant race from human and in return? Scripted by Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris and David Hayter tells the continuing story of favorite mutants in a large canvas. They tried to give their best in this 2nd chance by adding few favorite mutants to the plot like Nightcrawler, Deathstrike, Colossus and the very little unrecognized 'Beast' aka Dr. Hank McCoy. But the major problem in the movie was its plot, it got no strength, no intention, no drift it's Only got a great STORYBOARD. Producers plan was : Filling Weak plot adding essential cast from the original chapter, also by mixing new ones with the cut down of some previous mutants, then summing them with the trendy special FX. Mission accomplished, X2 was born.I don't know what the hell was respected Helly Barry thinking while reading this script. She was wasted completely, she got nothing to do with this movie, I can't remember a single scene of Storm from it, may be she liked to wear her new wig! Same thing happened to Scott Summers aka James Marsden, he was blown out of the map in this story, but hey he has some memorable scene which he performed nicely.Also some of the previous characters were removed from this version making a great miss at Ray Park's Todd, not like the original comic book smart character but still my favorite Tyler Mane's Sabertooth. The great miss was the removal of the musical genius Michael Kamen, resulting a non-thematically score in X2 from the unskillful replacement John Ottman. The original X-men soul was created enormously by the hands of veteran Michael Kamen giving a defined signature depth to the X-Men universe, but Singer's buddy John Ottman did noting to go beyond that level. His score was pliable when it comes to romantic themes as well as in action scenes where he failed miserable on Jean Grey's romantic triangle and Logan's uncovered past.An only thing stand along in the movie was Logan's storyline, plus the character developments in Jean Grey. Famke Janssen did a clear work in portraying the confused lover, where Jackman add few pounds to his acting styles. In the first movie I was unhappy to see Jackman's Logan minus muscles, X2 break that law, he is now so similar to Marvel comics Sean Chen's Wolverine. But his casual outfits sucked, he seemed scrawny like a chicken kid in the opening Canadian outdoors and hair looked dead. Kelly Hu as Logan's new killing enemy Yuriko Oyama was the only one so Accurate to the comic book character, besides Patrick's Xavier. Also Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler Rocked, decreasing Rebecca Romijn-Stamos's Mystique screen value.All in all it's a movie we can bear with if it is not seen twice or more. This lame chapter features the drastic debut of Nightcrawler and the farthest final of Jean Grey so, Just See it for once.X2: X-Men United = Weak Plot: meant to United.",1,3,10,16 March 2005
Aladdin," Golden Days of Disney
","I was in 7th grade when this movie came out. I loved it but when I look back now, it is sad to know that this movie was the last flame of Classic Disney Era, which was contaminated by NEW AGE PIXAR CGI movies.Aladdin (Spoilers******) Directed by Ron Clements and John Musker tells a new cinematic experience of animation based on the old Arabian folk tale Aladdin and the Magic Lamp. They did a tremendous work with brilliant animators in binging Aladdin to Disney.As like all other Disney movies it has a good story, good script and a great music. Scott Weinger did a tremendous vocal works for giving life to Aladdin. He himself lived in that character. Also Linda Larkin was marvelous as the voice of Jasmine. I liked Gilbert Gottfried's comic villain Iago.But the man who steals the show is ROBIN WILLIAMS, I can't believe he was the man who did that dominant voice-over for Genie, a true genius! And music, the soul of Aladdin was created by Alan Menken with the help of Dennis McCarthy. It was the music that gave Aladdin the magical life. With the memorable lyrics of Howard Ashman and Tim Rice summing with those catching tunes how can any one forget the title song, 'A Whole New World' and 'Prince Ali' with the top-notch vocal talents of Brad Kane, Lea Salonga, Regina Belle, Peabo Bryson. But it was Robin Williams whose creativity in this project makes those works extraordinary. His comedy timing and musical talents really shined in every second. It was sad to know that he was paid low in return for his hardships.For me it's a GREAT Movie in every means. A TRUE Cinematic Experience for a true Classic Disney fan like me! ' I give this movie 10 stars out of 10 thumbs up ! '",10,1,2,5 April 2005
Back to the Future," 'The CLASSIC MODERNpiece'
","When I saw this movie I was thrown out by its theme. An excellent sci-fi, adventure epic, I LOVE that 80s. IT'S SIMPLY THE GREATEST TIME TRAVEL MOVIE EVER HAPPENED IN THE HISTORY OF WORLD CINEMA.I firstly heard about this movie on Discovery channel, I didn't know much about it's importance, even it's title, then one day I happened to read television listings and was struck by a title named 'Back to the Future'..? Man what was that? Months later unexpectedly watch that on AXN channel. WOW, I was thrilled by its idea. Huh,.. I almost lost in that future..Back to the future (Spoilers******) Directed by Robert Zemeckis the movie begins with Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) a teenager who has a really messed up family. His ultimate goal was to become a rock star which was heartened by his girl friend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells). But things went wrong when scientist Dr. Emmett Brown/Doc (Christopher Lloyd) wanted Marty's assistance for his new invention.At that night Marty went to assist Doc's invention the Time traveling Car 'DeLorean'. Marty was told to record Doc's first time travel to the future. At that instant they were attacked by some Libyan terrorists who were cheated by Doc for Plutonium.After killing Doc they turn towards to Marty and without any intention Marty enters the Time Traveling car. But it was previously set by Doc and when activated Marty gets transfer to 1955 from 1985.What will he do next, will he can come back to the future, or will he stuck back in the past for his rest of the life. More than that will his time travel make serious effects on the future? Dealing with time travel and time paradox Steven Spielberg presents this amazing journey of Marty set up in the time of 80's and 50's. Scripted by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale for the story of Bob Gale himself, tells a science fiction adventure in a family oriented tone.They really work hard to sculpt that sci-fi thread into a thrilling, culture clashed family movie. A good story with a great script. Also the soul of the movie was given by the legend Alan Silvestri. His composition was all memorable especially in the chasing and emotional scenes. Over the top the theme music, it was the most dazzling and recognizable themes in the movie history.More than that the casting was simply brilliant, each and every actor is born to play their respected roles in this movie. Michael J. Fox was the only actor who can play the role of energetic Marty McFly, which was considered for numerous actors. Also Thomas F. Wilson was brilliant in his performance as the Bad boy Biff Tannen. Lea Thompson did a great work in portraying Lorraine Baines's two different life times, as a teenage girl and a matured mother. Well the extra talented Christopher Lloyd had almost 'chewed every scenes' in the movie. Mr. Lloyd's versatile performance as the madman and genius scientist Dr. Emmett Brown is one of the great memorable roles in his carrier.Last but not the least, it was Crispin Glover who steal the show as the nerdy teenager/father as George McFly. It was an interesting portrayal as a boy who was transformed to a man. Crispin Glover lived in that part. I don't know whether the movie would be a masterpiece without his unique performance. Above all I want to remember this as a romantic movie and it couldn't be made without the songs 'The Power of Love,' and 'Earth Angel'.All in all it is the GREATEST SCI-FI, ROAMANTIC MOVIE OF THE ALL TIMES. It is the part of the great Movie History, which consider itself as ' A MODERN/CLASSIC MASTERPIECE! '' I gave this movie 10 thumps up out of 10 stars.'",10,4,5,4 March 2005
