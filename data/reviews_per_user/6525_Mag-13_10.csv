The New World," Stunning, but play closed captions to understand the soft voice-over narrative
","Just like Thin Red Line, there is a soft, gorgeous, poetic voice-over narrative that tells the story. This helps the movie because an important part of the movie involves the misunderstanding between English and Indian languages.It's a wonderful love story. It answers the question all young girls have when they first hear that story from their 3rd grade teacher: 'Why did Pocahontas save John Smith's life, and why did she marry someone else instead of him?' The major parts were played very well. The voice-over narrative was a little too similar to Thin Red Line's...'Who are you. Who am I?' That kind of stuff. But if you suspend your disbelief, it adds to the artistry of it.",9,0,2,26 July 2006
The Sound of Music," Catholic girls love it.
","The nuns took us fifth graders on a long bus ride into downtown D.C. to see this film when it first came out.  The movie was so popular it stayed at that theater (The Ontario) for at least a year, so they took us again as sixth graders. While other posters on this site have complained about a lack of conflict until the Nazis show up, we Catholic girls completely understood the conflict in wanting to be a nun, but not passing muster. So the first minutes of the film, where we discover as she almost forgets to pick up her veil from the mountaintop that she is a nun and is late for chapel, we Catholic girls were entranced.  I think I paid to see this movie 30 times before it came out on videotape and I immediately bought it.  My kids were raised on it, watched it a dozen times, and we used the songs as lullabies. I'm pretty sated on it now, and a few things I find irritating, like the obviously pasted on wig the baroness wore and the silhouetted kissing scene between the captain and Maria that makes their mouths look like trumpets. And some of the incredibly bad acting by the children who appropriately ended up as real estate agents and small business owners. 
Nonetheless, it's an experience all people should have.  It is a fine musical.  I'd watch it again any day over the Rocky Horror Picture Show.",Null,0,5,9 April 2001
Knocked Up," Not Fair -- a Rip Off
","Is this the latest strategy for movie makers to squeeze money out of their vulnerable viewers: write a screenplay that is so funny that as you're laughing, you miss the next joke, forcing you to see the movie twice? Do the makers of this movie realize that movie admission is now beyond $9? That means, in order to catch all the jokes, I have to see Knocked Up a second time. And what happens if I again laugh at the A jokes, missing the B jokes? I could end up spending not $18, but $27 to enjoy just one film. Maybe I should bring a damp towel to the theater and press it tightly against my mouth so I don't make that horsey sound that I call a laugh. Will theater owners allow me to bring in 'outside' towels? What a conundrum this movie has left me...in.",10,3,10,13 June 2007
Burn After Reading," Writing and Editing were Brilliant
","Well, I thought it was funnier than Lebowski. The plot kept you on the edge of your seat the entire time.As far as the cast, Tilda Swinton is frigging scary in this movie. Her character made my stomach turn. I haven't seen Mexican, so this was the first time I saw Brad Pitt show his silly side and I liked it. Same with Frances Mcdormand's character's cluelessness. They both were so out of their usual characters.Clooney was his usual brilliant self. Does he need a reliable housekeeper that will pamper him like he deserves? But it was the WRITING and the EDITING that were the real stars. I've seen a few Coen movies and this one is now my second favorite, after Hudsucker Proxy which was brilliance and class all wrapped up together.",10,2,5,24 December 2008
Cast Away," The ratings speak for themselves. Go see this one while it's in the theaters.
","Cinematography is beautiful. Special effects are stunning. Tom Hanks' acting is on par with Forrest Gump. Plot is fascinating. Under 12 may find parts of it boring, but it is a perfect 'what if' scenario for those of us who have ever wished we were alone on a deserted island.This is a MUST SEE.Mag",8,0,0,26 December 2000
Pearl Harbor," Special effects well worth matinee admission price.
","The special effects made the movie well worth the matinee admission price of $6.00.   But PLEASE make sure you're seeing it in a theater with a VERY good sound system.  The sound effects and the planes flying into the corners of the screen are the only good things about the movie.  OK, Josh Hartnet's incredibly chiseled face, too.But, believe all the other commenters here:  the script STINKS.  You're embarrassed for the actors that they have to deliver the lines.Mag",Null,0,0,26 May 2001
Pretty Woman," Painfully bad script
","I love this movie, so I've seen it a hundred times and thus I know the lines before they're served. But unlike other films that I know by heart, A Room With a View or Dances with Wolves, for instance, the lines from Pretty Woman are embarrassingly bad. I just looked up its writer, who created several titles I've never heard of. Pretty Woman is a testament to Julia Roberts and Richard Gere's on screen chemistry, as well as to Rodeo Drive fashion. 'Cop a squat?' Gimme a break.I will say that her unsuccessful shopping foray on Rodeo Drive was an absolute pleasure, especially when she is finally being 'sucked up' to.Nice sight gags, too, like the father and son in the Rolls Royce both talking on cell phones. A child with a cell phone? Preposterous!",Null,3,6,5 December 2007
Wedding Crashers," vince vaughn worth seeing twice
","cool dry place, clay pigeons, wedding crashers...those are top of the line vaughn shows. especially clay pigeons and wedding crashers, although he's one hottie in cool dry place.The script is what gives vince his vehicle. I can't believe a screenwriter would dare write something as quick as this in these mindless days.this is a powerful role...powerfully wicked and funny. the plot is simple, but the characters are so bad, you never notice. i loved seeing the various ethnic weddings. Luke Wilson is a little thin compared to vince vaughn, but isla fisher and that pioneer doctor lady were good. actually, isla fisher was funny as hell. i love vaughn's acting, but i wouldn't want to actually know him. scary dude.m",8,1,2,1 August 2005
The Good Shepherd," am i the only one?
","Fantastic story. When it was over, I asked my son, who also loved it, what time it was. He said, 'That was a 3 hour movie.' Neither of us had any idea it had been that long. It felt like 20 minutes. Fantastic. Am I the only one, however, that realized that Wilson's son is not his child, that Margaret seduced him at the party to hide her pregnancy? She never tells him it is not his child because she wants to protect her son.Also, I love not knowing at the end who threw the girl out of the plane: Wilson? the CIA? the KGB? OK, the odds are that Wilson had it done, but who knows? If he had already known it was going to happen, wouldn't he have shown up on time to his son's wedding? OK, to those folks who said they hated it. Well, sorry it wasn't Casino Royale. Fact is, the CIA is even more boring than this. It wasn't meant to be an action film. It is more like a horror film that moves slowly through its acts. Think of it as Syriana for bookkeepers. It is full of suspense, but we learn an awful lot about how these spies work. There's a new spy movie out, about Robert Hansen, the FBI agent with 6 kids who sold secrets to the Russians and who put nude pix of his wife up on the internet without her knowledge. It takes a kind of kooky person to thrive in that covert environment.",8,7,11,27 December 2006
The Thin Red Line," For the birds
","10 points out of 10Birds tie this story together. The caged bird singing beautifully in Witt's dying mother's bedroom. The bird cage, now broken and empty, that the destroyed Japanese battalion had kept, showing that they, too, loved life. The owl that watches the Japanese soldiers appear magically from the woods to kill Witt. The toucans that stand and watch, the vultures that wait for soldiers to die, the seagulls that Malick shows whenever the beautiful palm trees sway. The bats, ironically, similar to birds but symbolic of death, that wrap themselves in their leathery wings, like body bags, just before Witt knowingly gets himself killed. The love birds at the end who survive. And, last, but not least, Sargeant Welsh's reference to the dying bird as he speaks of Witt's love for life.Symbolically, metaphorically, it is on par with Citizen Kane. Spiritually, it is the best movie out there. The message is clear. 'You can keep your innocence, and, although your innocence won't spare you from suffering, it will make the world heavenly when you're not suffering.' The Japanese face in the ground and Welsh's bird soliloquy say it all.This movie has changed my life. But it is a new age, conscientious version of the book. Last night I watched the movie 3 times. Today I checked the book out of the library.There are no references yet to birds! I'm on page 40 something, and the only characters that clearly made it into the movie are Captain Staros (Stein), Welsh (Welsh), and Fife (Bell) and Doll (Doll). Well, the book has 430 pages, and I did notice that Witt shows up later. But there is no incidence of going AWOL at the beginning.I think I'm going to suggest I compare/contrast the book with the movie as my final project for my cinema class. I need to know when Malick first read the book, if ever, and why the whole thing is so changed.Mag",9,1,2,7 July 1999
