Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Have you ever seen better effects?
","Some people think that this movie was tasteless because of Jar Jarbinks' character.  I don't think he was meant to reflect a slave or some other type of raccist sugestion.  Considering he was played by Ahmed Best, which some people don't realise, he wasn't totally animated! This movie was excellent, I own it and have seen it in the theater 2 times. Ewan McGregor was EXCELLENT! Natalie Portman played a commanding queen and surpassed her age in her character. I recommend this movie to all!",9,11,15,5 June 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," If you haven't seen this movie, you haven't lived!
","I was skeptical the first time I saw this film, it takes at least the age of 10 to fully appreciate how awesome this movie really was.  Considering it was made in 1977 this movie has better special effects than that of some movies made in the 90's. In my opinion this was the most original movie ever made!",10,0,0,5 June 2000
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," In my opinion the worst of the trilogies
","This movie was one of the best I have seen but in my opinion the worst of all the Star Wars movies.  The 'Luke I am your father' is pretty much spoiled for everyone under the age of 20.. We all know! It was dark and the battle on Hoth was shot very nicely.  You should see this movie, but if you have to choose between the 3.. Return of The Jedi is the best!",8,2,5,5 June 2000
