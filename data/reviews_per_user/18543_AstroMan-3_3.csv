The Blair Witch Project," Innovative, intelligent, and deeply disturbing.
","This movie is one of the few that I have seen which left me feeling unnerved.  Many of the scenes and ideas in the movie will creep up on you as you are about to drift off to sleep in bed and jerk you into an alert frenzy to find a nightlight.  This movie managed to keep things moving and slowly turn a hike in the woods into a life and death struggle with the unknown. You can be sure that after seeing it will generate a great deal of thought and discussion with your friends.  One of my friends that I saw this movie with had to sit there until the 'All events in this movie are fictitious and any resemblance to real stuff is completely coincidental' message appeared on the screen.  She said eve though she new it wasn't real before she saw it, she had to make sure after seeing it because she couldn't go to sleep if it was real.  I think that captures my feelings entirely.  In conclusion... SEE THIS MOVIE!",10,1,2,2 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Visually stunning, but perhaps they could have had computer enhanced acting too?!
","Well, If you liked the original movies, then this is a lot like them. Same directing from the 70's and the same stiff acting by the Skywalkers. Luke developed well in the latter movies, hopefully they will go with and older Anakin who will have to be played by a decent actor.  Also... Jar-Jar = Bantha poodoo.  His entire race was much worse than the Ewoks.  I never want to see them again. Of course on the good side, AMAZING EFFECTS, and all the fighting scenes, especially the sword play.  There were many things set up which could play out well in the next movies.  It seems that this is really meant to be only one third of a story.  This was the character introduction and general setting up of things.  Nothing more, nothing less.  We shall see if the best is yet to come :)",6,0,1,21 May 1999
X-Men," Could have been great, but instead was OK.
","As the movie began, I thought 'oh good, they're keeping the more serious tone of the X-men instead of sinking to the just say a cool one-liner and then blow something up action flick.'  However, the intelligent villains and emotional depth of the characters quickly gave way to 'Hasta la vista, Baby'.  The plot quickly started to rely on intelligent characters suddenly acting stupid.  Imagine something on par with Mystery Men, only this wasn't a comedy.  The action sequences had some brilliant moments (Wolverine vs. Mystique), but the bulk of them just didn't convey the pace and intensity of super-heros battling super-villains.  The majority of the combat sequences were just how many times can someone get sent flying (obviously on a digitally removed wire) through a wall.  You get hit by lightning... fly through a wall, you get blasted by cyclops' eye beams... fly through a wall. Maybe I've just seen too many good combat sequences in Kung-Fu movies, but I was left less than impressed by the directing during most of the fight sequences.  On top of the statue of Liberty there's about 1-2 seconds in a fight sequence where Wolverine and Sabertooth are both obscured by Lady Liberty's crown!  I left the theater feeling like this movie came so close, but fell short so many times.  If you're going to theater, see something else and wait for this to come out on video.",6,0,0,15 July 2000
