Deja Vu," great movie
","I watched the movie and I felt desire to see it again . I started it again straight away and strangely, but I had no Deja Vu feeling. Despite I should know what will happen, this was not so important because I was looking for other things from another point of view and I still found new details filling the general picture. Denzel Washington acting is great. Regardless that his role is quite serious he still uses those flashes where he can demonstrate his glamour. The actions are developing really fast. Director smartly does not stress the attention over the great tragedy in the beginning, with turgid screens and visual effects exaggeration. Simply there is no need to do that, the story board is quite exciting.This is a movie for the presence of mind and the power of the spirit.Those of you who like Crash and Lucky number slevin will adore Deja Vu for sure.A classy one and I regularly vote with 9.",9,0,1,9 February 2007
