Moneyball," Shockingly, Even Better than the Non-Fiction Book of the Same Name
","I read the book Moneyball when it came out, and was long familiar with sabrmetrics, and after seeing the Bad News Bears-style previews had low expectations of a Hollywood movie of the same name.Instead of the Bad News Bears Turn Adult, or Rocky-on-the-Diamond, or Major League IV: The GM's Revenge -- all things it could have been -- this movie turns out to be an incredibly thoughtful homily on doing the right thing because the facts tell you to do it, because you have no choice but to listen to the voice inside yourself. It's both a parable for (hang on to your hats) the impasse of the political system in the age of the Freakout and the Talking Head, and a reminder that individual conscience ultimately controls your own fate.Some disclaimers. First off, the book only loosely uses the book 'Moneyball' for its text, sort of the way a good Sunday sermon starts out with a passage from the bible and then pulls in all sorts of more topical and contemporary information to make a new interpretation. Those of you looking for, say, the long sequence in the book about the celebrated 'Moneyball' amateur draft will find it missing. It necessarily takes an ensemble of real-world characters and reduces it to some amalgams (the Jonah Hill character). And it ignores a lot of the baseball nuance that the numbers open up -- from the contributions of Mulder, Hudson, and Zito to the true meaning of plate discipline. It has to, because otherwise the story and the theme would get lost in the details. For that reason, the book still stands on its own and is recommended, while the movie is going to stand on its own for those who haven't read it.But this is the kind of remarkable thing: I knew how everything was going to turn out. I knew about the A's winning streak and how the improbable record was set. I knew how the season ended (I was at several of the games) and how and why Billy Beane ended up staying in Oakland, neither fired nor hired away, and why he's still there. And yet I was still riveted by this movie and the way the story unfolded.There is one sort of semi-sports-cliché montage towards the end of the movie, but it ends very much against expectation. Similarly, the filmmakers pay with the cliché of the 'big locker room pep talk' scene, so hackneyed in almost every other sports movie. And they sort of tease by limiting the on-field action to just the bare minimum; just as Billy Beane didn't like to watch the games in person, the on-field story of the A's is not depicted as the central subject matter.I have no idea how this movie is going to do. For those looking for a traditional baseball/sports movie, it's completely unique -- more like Downhill Racer than Rocky. For those looking for the business-cum-statshead movie, it's not there - such a thing is unfilmable. For those looking for the riotous comedy the previews promise -- well, there's plenty of humor, but it's far dryer and more subtle than the trailers suggest, and a comedy, it is not. For those looking for a treacly he-did-it-all-for-his-daughter money-isn't-everything heartstrings movie, well, the theme is there but it's pretty understated and intelligent - there's no violins.The visuals for this movie are going to probably not get mentioned a lot, but I think they're the key to understanding the breadth of the ambition of the movie. We get a lot of 'real' baseball scenes -- but they're in the mode of the empty concrete hallways of the Oakland Coliseum, the emptiness of the park after hours, the crappy locker rooms. Even the scene at Fenway Park -- really shot there, and looking more like the 'real' Fenway than any other movie I've seen that uses it as a backdrop - is done with the park empty and covered with a cold rain that suggests austerity. In the meantime, we get glimpses of the 'real' Oakland - working class, full of empty landscapes and ship loading equipment and power lines (without those visuals taking any focus away from the character-driven story) that seem to ably reflect the feeling of being in America in 2011 (not the 2002 in which the story takes place).I suspect many reviews will focus on this as the 'story of Billy Beane' and it's entirely true that as a character, he seizes the story front and center, and Brad Pitt's (definitely Oscar-worthy) performance deserves a lot of attention. Certainly the use of flashbacks (also not done in a terribly hackneyed way, kudos) to underscore Billy's motivations -- which are complex, but may simply boil down to wishing to be a success in a way true to his nature, instead of the conventional wisdom crowd's desire to merely avoid being a failure -- is nicely done.In the end, it's a brilliant film because it works on at least three levels. It's a reasonable exposition of how an idea changed the game of baseball, not about the people who came up with the idea so much as how the idea wormed its way in. It's not quite a documentary, but it's close in that sense, and should be illuminating for people who don't know that story (and perhaps will send them back to Moneyball, the book, and hopefully the original source material.) On another level, it's a compelling story about one person, not exactly a put-upon working class schmo, in the persona of Billy Beane. And on the larger level, it's certainly a hint about how people have to find their way in a larger system of economics, personality, and politics that is frequently soul-deadening and perplexing and offers few cut-and-dried solutions to the nuanced and complex problems of the world.",9,2,4,25 September 2011
Amistad," I don't like Spielberg, but this was decent
","It's also somewhat historically inaccurate (what Spielberg based on a true story isn't?) but the story of the Amistad rebellion is so powerful that it survives the usual Spielbergisms. As usual, there's a scene with a bunch of white guys in court, and they actually concatenated a long series of legal maneuvers in real life into the single dramatic courtroom sequence, a truly trod to death device. I also thought the story on film missed one of the major points one might take from the historical incident -- that while the US system in the 19th century held the seeds of the civil war within, it also simultaneously held a concept of justice that transcended the primitive concepts of race and human equality of the time.The bottom line is that in real life the captives of the Amistad took their own destiny into their own hands, and that shines through in the flick, so well worth watching both as entertainment and edification on a sorely-neglected incident in US history.",6,1,3,6 July 2002
Forrest Gump," Overrated, awful hodgepodge of sentiment
","One of Oscar's low moments had to be in awarding this picturebest film, best director, and best lead actor. The movie's nothingbut a pastiche of sentimentalism and forced nostalgia, strungtogether with soundbytes and pasted-in beautiful visuals, like aHallmark card glued onto celluloid.The whole schtick of having Forrest appear at 'key moments' inthe 60s and 70s is just a sort of emotional rorshach blot on film,designed to allow the viewer to see whatever she or he wants.Even the soundtrack is a formulaic greatest hits soundtrack.Vietnam? Creedence! Drug scene in the early 70s? The Doors!Want to relive the running craze of the 70s? Jackson Browne's'Running on Empty!'  Yes, the movie is that achingly literal.I'm also stunned Hanks got best actor for this film. Hollywoodreally does love actors playing 'special' people, doesn't it? (DustinHoffman in Rainman, Billy Bob Thornton in Sling Blade, etc. )Hanks is a professional, to be sure, but given the plotless text andthe range of emotions in the character (the whole gamut fromscared and stupid to confused and stupid), it wasn't a whole lot towork with.In an allegedly enlightened era, too, there's a lot of humour in thismovie which is basically, 'look at how stupid this retarded guy is!he doesn't know his mother's whoring! he doesn't know a shrimpboat isn't a tiny little craft! he doesn't get ironic humour like we do!ha ha ha ha ha!' Pair him up with another such person in theVietnam sequences, ha ha, it's so funny the two dummies don'tknow the other one is a dummy! So to compliment the trite,non-dramatic sentimentalism, we have sophomoric comedy at theexpense of the mentally retarded.The one curiousity is an early performance by Haley Joel Osmentas, of course, a preturnaturally loquacious but cute mop-toppedurchin (spoiler coming) named Forrest Gump Junior.",2,19,44,29 June 2002
Burn After Reading," Criminal waste of talent due to script holes
","So about 2/3 of 'Burn After Reading' is terrific, classic Coen brothers, with stellar actors making the most out of their somewhat cartoonish characters. (Clooney and Pitt ham it up, quite agreeably, while Malkovich and McDormand tease out a little depth from their characters, but Richard Jenkins and Tilda Swinton are mostly wasted with throwaway parts). There's not a ton of suspense, which indicates maybe the brothers were a bit off their game, but there's plenty of tragic-comic premise to go around here in a tale of middle-aged burnout and false aspirations to change one's game while it's in progress.But, without giving any spoilers here, the problem is the script really falls apart in the last third of the movie. Perhaps it was studio edits, but the scenes with JK Simmons as a senior CIA official in which he and an underling recap the plot and then, unforgivably, do the kind of wrap-up that is usually shown on screen about each of the characters, suggests they ran out of shoot time and just had to tack those bits in in order to give any sense of closure about the plot and characters' fates. (The one such scene in the middle reminds me oddly of the Santa Rosa policemen in 'Mad Mad Mad Mad World', who connect the threads of the various characters' journeys by explicating a little with a map for the audience, although unlike 'Burn After Reading' that was rather deftly done.) In the end, if you don't go 'what, that's it?' like I did, I would in turn be surprised.I'd love to find out the story (there must be one) about where this production went off the skids. But my rec is: don't waste your time.",4,0,1,28 February 2019
Saving Private Ryan," Confuses Verisimilitude, Authenticity, Documentation, and Realism
","Much has been made of the 'realism' of this movie because thecombat scenes are graphic, intense, and more accurate in therange of detail than much of what came before it. But as much wasmade of the 'authenticity' of this movie because of the attention todetail made in its preparation. For instance, Spielberg bought upthe last stock of original legging and strap material to make part ofthe uniforms, real M-1 rifles, searched exhaustively for the beachappropriate for shooting that was absolutely closest to theappearance of Normandy in 1944, and so forth.But let's think about that. What's the point of having an 'authentic'cartridge belt, except that the audience knows about this from thereviews, planted press stories, etc.? A replica can be made to lookmore like the authentic thing than the authentic thing itself, giventhe aging of the intervening years. But this was a sort of formalisticpost-modern exercise engaged by the filmmakers to convincehimself and the audience, before even seeing the movie, thatwhat they were seeing represented the 'truth'.<potential spoiler follows>The opening scene of the aged Ryan, walking the graveyards ofNormandy, reflecting on the sacrifice of so many of his comradesjust so he could walk there with his adoring grandkids, is a classicexample of Spielberg heavy-handedness. He has to inject atone-deaf repetition of the 'why we fight' message into thebeginning, end, and middle of this movie to show that it was 'allworth it'. Spielberg, being a literalist, has every character in thesquad pontificate on the subject along the way to locate PrivateRyan.Why? Why do eight guys get themselves killed just to save one?Well, the needs of the one sometimes outweigh the needs of themany. Frankly, Star Trek III made the point somewhat more subtly. Or is it the words put into Tom Hanks' character's mouth, 'I'm justfighting for the right to go home to my wife'? There's no elucidationof this point here, just a ham-fisted morphing flashback andflashforward to hammer home the point 'hey, this is connected tothe present' leaving the viewer to connect up the soundbyte dots.I won't go into the many war movie cliches this film engages in.Because Spielberg put together the celebrated first 20 minutes ofthis movie, some of the most stunning combat sequences put onfilm, does not excuse him the rest of the movie's repeated use ofB-movie props and stereotypes. Even the use of 'documentary'film techniques in the combat sequences is a bit too precious: it'sreferential to real film of real combat, but hardly 'documentary'.Documentary evidence shows things that happened: this filmuses the technique to try to convince the viewer that a fictive,simplistic interpretation of war, the whys and the whats, is 'reality'.The verisimilitude of the visuals of the combat sequences doesnot make it 'real'. Using authentic materials from World War IIdoes not make it 'real'.  At the bottom of this movie is one versionof a fairy tale about war.For that reason I think 'Private Ryan' is a dangerous film, becauseit's become the primary historical education for most people aboutD-Day, World War II, and American participation in the mostcataclysmic event in history to date, and it's about as 'true' to thatcomplex history as John Wayne was to the history of the West. Anexciting, hard-hitting action combat sequence that gets theapproval of veterans sixty-years removed from the events as being'like what it was' isn't history. It's constructing a virtual reality thatthreatens to overtake, engulf, swallow, and become history, like apod person in Invasion of the Body Snatchers.I am left mostly wondering what Sam Fuller could've done withSpielberg's budgets.",3,6,13,10 July 2002
The Red Violin," Great little flick, but...what was it about again?
","I really enjoyed this movie. I don't think it's the deep, profound epic some seem to suggest, but I liked the idea of the violin as the McGuffin, and as an axis for the film, it held things together very nicely. I won't provide any spoilers here, but I was a little perplexed as to what to make of the ending except as a very simple little parable about the continuity of civilization; it seemed a little out of character, nevertheless.I write today, however, to praise Samuel L. Jackson. Even though he's got a relatively small role in this film, it really shows what he can do when given some space to stretch out. It reminded me very much of the way Gene Hackman almost always 'blends in' to his role, making you forget he's Gene Hackman, which is the hallmark of good film acting. Sometimes Sam can get a role where you say to yourself, 'man, I love Samuel Jackson' (Shaft, Jackie Brown, etc.), which is fun in itself but often detracts from the film around him. This time around, though, his chops are great AND he becomes the role; it makes me want to see him in more roles like this, and fewer Pulp Fiction riffs.",7,1,1,6 May 2003
Enemy at the Gates," Epic Storytelling through a Suspenseful Tale of Individuals at War
","I've now watched this movie four or five times, and it continues to impress me with each viewing. Criticisms that it does not accurately depict the battle of Stalingrad are missing the point. The movie doesn't purport to tell the whole story of the epic battle of the greatest land war ever known (and we hope humanity will ever endure) in terms of a historical recapitulation of this happened, then that happened, and so forth. It rather instead attempts to take this epic, incredibly difficult story and reduce it to the battle between two men, two individuals, two snipers - the ultimate individualists and cold-blooded killers. That the movie has both interesting personalities, a gripping action arc, and still manages to encapsulate the great sense of apocalyptic struggle that was the combat of World War II makes it all the more remarkable. It manages to be epic through a simple love triangle and a simple contrast between the simple but indomitably optimistic Zaitsev and the sophisticated but world-weary Koenig.There is not any particular sympathy for either the (Communist) Russians or the (Nazi) Germans generated in the film.The movie opens up with Russians massacring their own troops who have the temerity for retreating from an attack cut to pieces by the Germans, where only a fraction of their force are even armed. The character of Koulikov, an expert sniper sent to provide cover for Zaitsev in his duel with Koenig, through the simple story of how his Communist masters quickly turned on him ably sums up the arbitrary terrors of the Stalin years. The Nazis in turn are shown sending a prisoner to his death at the hands of his Russian comrades and engaging in other personal atrocities that demonstrate their ruthless inhumanity without resorting to the typical film stereotypes. (The most effective of these comes at the film's climax, epitomizing the strange humanism of German culture as corrupted by the Nazi sense of utility which was ultimately so amoral.) There's an economy here in the storytelling which others would do well to imitate.For the most part, the ordinary German and Russian soldiers are shown for what they were -- suffering cannon fodder, the two clashing (and discreditable) ideologies that cause their suffering distant in the background. Yet we manage to get a sense of why each man fights -- the sense of duty that devolves (or evolves) into a sense of loyalty to one's comrades and ultimately just to the man (or woman) right next to them. Koenig becomes more and more isolated -- the lone eagle, or wolf, as it turns out in the film's opening metaphor -- even as Zaitsev develops a complicated set of supporting relationships. The heroism of Zaitsev develops in an interesting contrast to the propaganda version of Zaitsev created by his friend, the educated political commissar Danilov. Danilov's genuine willingness to lay his own life on the line, his desire to make his own contribution in what he clearly sees holistically as a grand, epic battle on which the whole fate of the country is clear from the first scene where he and Zaitsev meet in a no-man's land filled with the corpses of their comrades. Yet Danilov degrades, gradually, his personal loyalty being subsumed by his ambition and the success, and Zaitsev becomes more a tool for him than the friend who saved his life. The ends of politics become a justification to Danilov for personal betrayal.Caught between Zaitsev and Danilov is Chernova, who has the education and skills to be an intelligence officer or political commissar -- and seemingly the perfect match in background for Danilov -- but the heart and desire to emulate Zaitsev and become a sniper. She moves from Danilov's world back into Zaitsev's in a way that is almost a barometer of how the spirit of the Russian soldiers ended up winning the day in spite of, not because of, the brutal ideologies of their government.The duel is unpredictable, yet also predictable in a way, and without giving out a spoiler let's just say that even if you can guess the outcome, it's still worth watching for the suspense of exactly how it's played out. What I really admire about this film when all is said and done that despite the pseudo- intellectual critical analysis I've described above, it's just a taut story that moves you along without having to really see the whole big epic sweep of themes. One incidental note: complaints in other reviews about the 'lack of accents' by the various British and American actors is really missing the point about doing a film in English about Russians and Germans made by a French director. Not resorting to the fakery of movie conventions of trying to do fake accents for the bad guys (and usually American accents for the good guys) simply allows the actors to act, and without any context for the typical viewer as to what an educated or peasant accent might be for a German or Russian, their own voices come across somehow more authentically.",8,1,3,7 July 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," Overrated.
","Perfectly fine yarn, but those who are ranking it among the all-time greatest movies need to see some more flicks. The cliches are pretty heavy at times, and the moral of the story seems to be freedom _isn't_ a mental state, after all.",6,2,5,16 November 2001
