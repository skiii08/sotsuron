Captain Phillips," I hung onto every second of this tense thriller. Hanks was remarkable in this role.
","I went to see this movie as an exclusive Cineworld Unlimited IMAX preview screening, which was very exciting as I had been looking forward to viewing this movie after seeing the trailers earlier in the month. The movie had me gripped from start to finish; the atmosphere was crafted very well, making the viewer experience the tension and strain on a person during the ordeal both Captain Phillips and his crew endured.Captain Phillips is based on the book 'A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALS, and Dangerous Days at Sea' written by Captain Phillips himself. The movie accounts the hijacking by Somali pirates, of the Maersk Alabama ship back in 2009. The movie highlights the relationship between Captain Phillips (Tom Hanks) and the pirate leader Muse (Barkhad Abdi) during the hostile takeover of the ship, up to its thrilling conclusion.I thought this was a wonderfully paced movie, firstly setting the stage for the movie, from both Captain Phillips's perspective, as well as that of the Somali pirates. While most clearly won't agree with them or want to sympathise, the movie does show you the reality of these countries. Whereas the individual may not want to commit these actions, they feel they have no other option in life and are doing what they have been demanded to do by higher powers. The only niggle I would say, is to give it a more realistic feel, some of the filming was hand held, which when watching it at an IMAX cinema, can make you feel a little queasy, but I get why they chose to film this way, it all adds to the feeling your with the characters every step of the way, feeling almost everything they do.If anything, this movie is worth seeing for Hanks performance, which I'm sure will earn him another Oscar nomination, for his performance towards the end of the movie. The scenes following his rescue from the lifeboat were very intense; I did feel overcome with the emotion of Captain Phillips, during the medical checkups at the end. I couldn't help but feel so sorry & could not begin to comprehend what he was thinking at that time, completely taken over by the shock of what had happened. This as well as some of the clever things Captain Phillips did to try & save his crew and ship, from the small communications via radio to give the crew a heads up, to the info he gave to the rescue team to help them try to save him.This is one of those movies that you want to say is such a great film, but you have to stay grounded, as this was based on a true story, one that was a horrible event & nobody should ever have to experience that kind of trauma in their life. It's a very gritty, tense thriller, one of the better ones I've seen in a while.",9,2,5,15 October 2013
This Is the End," Awesomely Funny! If you love the likes of 'Superbad', 'Pineapple Express' & 'Eastbound & Down', this is the movie you have been waiting for!
","I had been looking forward to this movie as soon as I heard it was being made, as I'm a huge fan of the majority of the actors in this movie. I got pretty much what I expected and also more.The story is pretty simple, Seth Rogen & Jay Baruchel head out to a party at James Franco's house, filled with plenty celebrities, when the apocalypse comes upon them. the movie pretty much follows how the survivors deal with this bleak situation. To be honest, I do feel the story was probably not the first thing they thought of, its more a case of lets get together with our friends & take the mickey out of each other & play up to our perceived selves, which works out very well!The effects for this movie were much better than I had expected, as well as much gorier, but it was more for comedic effect than ultra realistic horror territory. Add to the mix so far of a fantastic cast, good effects & an OK story a great soundtrack, although quite mainstream, it was very fitting from the likes of 'The Next Episode', MIA's 'Paper Planes' to 'Gangnam Style'. again, nothing felt out of place, or put in for the sake of it.You can tell that this movie was fun to make for all of the guys involved, so many laughs & absolutely ripping it out of each other, from the geeky James Franco to Michael Sera's over the top loudmouth & obnoxious character, as well as topping it off with Danny McBride being the bad ass you would expect! I cant wait for a home release to see the out-takes, you can imagine there would be plenty!You put all that together & you have a hilarious movie, which is a little gory & maybe doesn't have the best story in the world, but your there to see the guys all make you laugh. If you love the likes of 'Superbad', 'Pineapple Express' & 'Eastbound & Down', this is the movie you have been waiting for!",9,2,6,11 July 2013
Rush," Awesome! Gripping, cool, authentic & dramatic, this movie has it all.
","This was the movie I have been looking forward to watching all year, if not longer, from when I first heard it was being produced a year or so ago during Formula 1 coverage. When I first heard about it, I didn't have the greatest of hopes, worrying that Ron Howard wouldn't portray the sport correctly, or do it a disservice, but after seeing various interviews & him popping up at various events throughout the Formula 1 calendar, I was starting to go along with the hype & was in no way disappointed. This is the best movie I've seen this year. I was gripped from start to finish. It really had it all, from the authentic racing perspective, to the drama on track & the off track lives of both Hunt & Lauda, being portrayed excellently. This is the first film I've seen in a while where I can see myself watching this over & over again in the years to come.The movie is based on the unbelievably true story of James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) & Niki Lauda's (Daniel Brühl) rivalry during the 1970's in Formula 1. The story follows their starkly contrasting lifestyles both on the track, as well as in their personal lives off the track. James Hunt is your charming English playboy, living every day like its his last in both his driving and his party going lifestyle, whereas in contrast Niki Lauda is the consummate professional, having that extraordinary ability to know exactly what's required to get the utmost performance out of his car. They both push each other to strive for the world championship, to outdo each other, from their Formula 3 days in the early 1970's to the dramatic 1976 Formula 1 season.I don't believe there are enough superlatives to describe this movie, from the fantastic cinematography & the staging of the racing scenes. Yes there is a bit of use of CGI, but strip that back, there were real stunt drivers driving the real cars, with cameras mounted in ideal positions to get great shots. Even both Hemsworth & Brühl both entered into driver training to prepare for their roles, which added to the authenticity. I think Ron Howard nailed this, from the look of the cars, to capturing the spirit of 1970's Grand Prix. I was especially impressed with the detail in the sounds of the cars. You can tell it was crafted to hear the sound from the drivers perspective during shots focused on the drivers. You top off all this with an incredible story, which is even more impressive that its based on a true story.I really felt gripped throughout the movie, from the highs of the racing and the rivalry, through to the excruciating pain Lauda went through on his recovery, I really felt like I felt every emotion, good or bad throughout the movie. This is an incredible movie and I'm sure even if your not a Formula 1 fan, or even a sports fan, you will find something in the drama of the legendary rivalry between Hunt & Lauda, that is Rush!",10,4,6,20 September 2013
Man of Steel," Surprisingly good movie with a grand & epic feel you would hope for
","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie; I watched it having no expectations, having not been a massive fan of Superman compared to say X-Men & Wolverine. The Movie had an epic feel about it, which was necessary for Superman. With all the fights over huge distances, the sound & feel of the impacts during the fights, it just felt right for the movie & was pulled off very well with some excellent special effects.The story hasn't changed much from the comic books or previous versions of Superman movies, where a young boy comes to terms with the powers he was born with compared to other people. The movie follows his journey to discover where he came from and the purpose of his powers. When Earth is invaded by his race, he has to come of age & step up to become the symbol of hope for all of earth.There is a great cast for this movie, with Henry Cavill being superbly cast, as he is an almost perfect fit to step into Superman's costume. He has the look, as well as conveyed the struggle at times to comprehend what he was sent to Earth for. The rest of the supporting cast were very good, with mentions going out to Kevin Costner, Russell Crowe for their great fatherly roles, but in very different contexts, as well as Michael Shannon & Antje Traue as the ruthless Kryptonians. I felt that one of the movie's strong points was the grand battle scenes. They all were superbly done & very fitting for the man of steel. The most impressive scenes were of Faora-Ul & her lightning fast reflexes & combat ability. I was very impressed with the scale of the battles, which felt they were almost over whole cities, as well as into space. You really felt the impact of every hit. Also impressive was the advanced race of the Krypton's, again they were very well portrayed as an advanced race with their technology & knowledge.I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie, going in without any expectations & no huge desire to watch the movie, as I'm usually a big fan of Marvel & their movies. But after the likes of the Dark Knight trilogy, I shall certainly take notice of any more future DC movies, if they follow on from the standard of the Man of Steel.",8,1,7,18 July 2013
We're the Millers," One of the funniest comedies of the year, all the inappropriate things you could possibly think of for a made up family!
","I had seen the trailers for this movie the last few times I went to the cinema and I kind of had this written off as one of those movies that once you have seen the trailer, you have seen the best bits & the rest of the movie would be average. How wrong could I have been, this was a very entertaining movie & gave what the trailer promised and so much more. There were more laughs, plenty of one liners, and a decent story that didn't dry up as quickly as it could have. There is more to this movie than going along to watch Jennifer Aniston as a stripper!The story begins with a brief introduction of David (Jason Sudeikis), a drug dealer who seems to be cruising with his life, although something does seem missing for a 30 something guy, like a family of his own. After being cleared out of all his drugs & cash by a gang, his boss forces him to take a trip to Mexico to collect some marijuana. After a chance meeting in the street with a touring family, he comes up with a plan to get across the border without raising suspicion, by assembling a 'family', consisting of himself, his stripper neighbour Rose (Jennifer Aniston), Young neighbour Kenny (Will Poulter) & runaway girl Casey (Emma Roberts) who then go on a family holiday, with hilarious consequences.The movie has a decent, possibly under the radar cast, with Jennifer Aniston being the big draw to watch the movie, but the talent shines through. I'd even go as far as to say that Jason Sudeikis should have the top billing, being the main character & for all the perfectly delivered lines throughout the entirety of the movie, he kept me laughing the whole time, as well as fellow cinema goers who were watching along with me. I enjoyed Jennifer Aniston's character, she & Jason's characters really did fit & mesh well between the funny & serious scenes, although I did feel she came across a little awkward in the scenes in the strip club, although I do believe this was more down to the character she was playing & not wanting to be there, more than how the actress performed. The supporting cast were all great too, all playing up to typical stereotypes, from the sleazy strip club owner Todd (Ken Marino), to drug lord Brad Gurdlinger (Ed Helms) all adding to the hilarity. Add to this already great mix of talented & seriously funny actors & a good, evolving storyline, a good & fitting soundtrack, you got yourself one of the best comedies of the summer, if not the year!",9,0,2,5 September 2013
