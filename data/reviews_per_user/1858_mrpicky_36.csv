Ford v Ferrari," lets get real
","Movie is super primitive, cliche driven and as unoriginal as it gets. it totally holds on actors performances! script is brain dead. they did succeed with tear jerking goal, but boy everything else feels so artificial. re-watch it and you will come to the same understanding. cheesy dialog , poor camera, poor script.",5,1,4,6 January 2020
First Man," shaky cam strikes again
","I would give this biopic 6 if not for pointless shaky cam for all of two hours!!! WTF!
Its an avarage movie that shows darker side of test pilots life. Struggles and tragedies of their families. Movie started like it would be a good art piece but ends in pointless chaos and a Whimper. 'great'",5,3,5,16 December 2018
A Star Is Born," another overhyped mediocrity
","Cheesy, banal suckage. If you have any taste for good movie or music -dont waste your time. All movie rotates around pop mediocrity's showing some TV level acting on same level script. There are so many real talent in Soul or even Pop, why, God, WHY?! Glad didnt have to watch all of it.",4,5,10,15 January 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Thats better
","Gareth Edwards made a good side-story for the old Star Wars, explaining where did Leia get blueprints from. Don't get me wrong, it is still a rip off old movies, just not as blatant as The Force Awakens. We have Death Star again(third time!!!), yongling from desert planet, father-daughter conflict, new droid... facepalm. If Force Awakens was a soulless fake. Roge One was made with some love, you can feel it. It's not really dark, just more gloomy take on resistance struggle. There was no new stories, no interesting plot twist, but everything is just organic and in a natural flow. Good action sequences, some good jokes from droid, no brainless happy end. Now prepare your heads to be blown: there are no sword fights! Wow! What?! How did they make a rip-off from the Star Wars without sword fights, it's a mystery. Movie does not have the smallest smell of old Star Wars spirit, but it's OK. Lucas himself lost it long time ago. As people change! And masterpieces are more like giant coincidences from millions of inspirations, events, people on project and cultural scene of the period in general. So the best we can hope is new ideas or new take on old(and very simple) story. For now it's just a side-story. Guys please get some new ideas! You can't repeat the same thing over and over!",6,2,9,15 December 2016
Us," silly fixer-upper of a movie
","Unlike Get out- which was a solid and smart thriller, this is more of a comedy with almost no story and overall low budget feel. if we gave him a couple more years to work on script maybe we would get something decent. but this is a waste of time and they dragged it for 2 hours!",3,0,0,4 June 2019
Knives Out," hats off
",Unique and brilliant take on who done it genre. and not because of many twists but because its layered ironic and brilliant work of art. movie that is extremely well written and at the same time has fun with genre itself. My one beef is casting Ana de Armas. she is not very good.,9,0,4,9 February 2020
Aquaman," barf of a movie
","I wonder how many millions they have spent on fake reviews for this suckage ?
I doubt even children will be entertained by it. Pathetic characters , warned out plot, boring fight scenes. You will forget it the moment its over. big shame they wasted so much on this....",4,22,42,5 March 2019
Deadpool 2," better but still trash
","First movie had huge identity problems. It was intended to be an adult movie but it actually is more then any other marvel movie aimed on teenagers. Here we have some human values and overall more mature tone.but It is still aimed at teenage bully demographic. We have better characters, better story, better and more jokes, but is it still a pile of trash. Raynolds still ia a bad actor and barely a human. All supporting characters have more personality then Deadpool.",5,3,12,21 May 2018
The Hateful Eight," OK mister Tarantino, you may sit at the table
","I hate Q. Tarantino films, they represent teenage level of maturity and are openly stupid.To be honest some thing he had going for him: his films are entertaining, they have good soundtracks and very good casting. On the other hand: they are embodiment of poor taste and are a product of an evil and sick mind. Well the mind did not get any healthier but the rest got much better. Strong plot, good characters, strong dialog, very engaging, nice camera. First 2|3 of this film are so good, they could have been made by the best in business, I could not tell. Last 1|3 is classic Tarantino: hardly believable trigger happy brains all over the walls trash. This is the first Tarantino that I would actually recommend someone. 10 more years and maybe he would actually grow into a mature director worthy of an Oscar or something.",6,0,2,6 March 2016
"I, Tonya"," Rednecks VS Figure Skating
","First impression was: Wow, Margot Robbie can act? That was a shoking and a pleasent surprise. And then it got only better and better. Steven Rogers and Craig Gillespie broght to screen crazy real life story of rise and fall of Tonya Harding. Sensation and a splinter in the history figure skating. Fantastic wrighting , rythm and acting puts this movie top 5 this year. Maybe even at number 1. This is a 'Must watch' movie! I liked it much more then Lady Bird! It is almost 'Big short' level masterpiece.",8,3,7,27 December 2017
BlacKkKlansman," Biography, Crime, Drama ?)) Really?
","Great dark comedy. you will be under the table on many occasions. somewhat rough writing but one fun trip. and it was tone deaf to change tone right at the end. Strong casting, nice overall rhythm. IDN was casting of some secondary characters off race intentional or not. but fun to wonder. Poor camera, pretty much no soundtrack. Overall little bit sad to see Lee going crazy again. At some points he would show same cliche driven racist tone that he trying to condemn in this movie. WTF?",6,5,7,21 January 2020
Suicide Squad," They made drag queen out of Joker
","To sum it up in a few words: Will Smith would be better off in Independence Day. You can be skeptical about any movie if there is too many big characters in it, usually trying to compensate for poor story. And if movie was not pre-released to critics, also raises suspicion. Well, Suicide Squad is as poor as Batman vs Superman. Lack of imagination, poor characters, poor story, very poor action scenes. Without adult/director supervision Will goes towards a man-child which he is in real life. So we have a poorly finished cartoon character instead of main one. Margot Robbie finding role of her life, but then suddenly braking out of characters(pre-madness and after)in one scene. Cara Delevingne acting is just one big Facepalm. The one character that is remotely interesting is the Boomerang fellow. He looked like he was trying to get out of that ridiculous movie, when couldn't - just stood there drinking beer. But worst of all: They made drag queen out of Joker, also Joker is sad most of the movie.",4,3,16,4 August 2016
Doctor Strange," Marvel at its finest
","I had low expectations for this movie after the trailer and boy that was a pleasant surprise. Doctor Strange is one of the best Marvel movies and definitely FX masterpiece. Strong story line, strong characters and stunning visuals. Mavie has it all covered with tons of humor on top of it. We are introduced to a new superhero and a new mystical universe. Its a classical character journey of main character from the gutter to saving the world, but there is so much more to it. We have some power, ego and responsibility dilemmas, teacher-student relationships and I cant stress enough how much work went into visuals. But Doctor Strange has its downsides also. Jon Spaihts and Scott Derrickson lack of talent in dramaturgy is very obvious. Many important scenes were done carelessly and lack dramatism they needed. Also many poor cuts made into the final edit. This movie could be so much more.",7,10,11,14 February 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," they are stealing from Robot Chicken)
",I had my doubts but now i see/ the whole new trilogy is based on things stolen from Robot Chicken skits :) rewatch them) so you would understand. even Lucas saw SW as a western in space for children. disney does not know what to do with it and has zero new ideas. Any director views it as cash grab and a movie for children. Its fun for them screwing it all up. bragging right and ego boost. at best they just try to fake what audience connected to. JJ put old characters in it so ppl would be triggered with trailers and gave him the money. and they did) success for them),5,5,9,31 December 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," WTF?
","Have you ever wondered what if the Yes-man was in charge of making movies? spider pig on big screen? Yes! no vision , no ideas, no new plot, just crazy expensive but still a poor fan fiction; Yes... corporate masterminds thought 'we will make spider man black and that alone will sell it' they were right , and you all giving it above 4 stars are all wrong. It was a pathetic rip-off with zero soul",4,12,27,22 February 2019
Avengers: Endgame," it's OK
","Of course it couldnt be as good as Infinity War. And to be fair it could be terrible, wich it isnt. But it is still not great in any way. 1 good joke and just a bunch of revisiting past episodes, thats it. Thats End Game. They sure leaned on tear jerking hard, and it did get me a little with Nebula reaching out. but overall it just shows that going into time travel paradoxes can be funny or stupid. And here it is second one i am afraid. Not a waste of time, but far from Infinity war. They would get so ,much respect if they actually ended it with IW))",5,19,35,26 April 2019
The Favourite," amazing art piece
","Again the film of the year didnt actually got the the Oscar. Political self pleasuring prevailed, just like last year, when Phantom thread was the clear winner. If I would be asked to describe this movie in one word it would be 'brutal'. We are told the tale of aristocracy fighting for power and awe, while been completely powerless and pathetic. It's extremely real in all its grotesque. Touching and repulsive at the same time. Great cast, great script, strong camera.
For thous who didnt understand the ending: queen lost her mind with grief, feeling of loneliness and betrayal. Abigail was shown that she is just a furniture.",9,6,9,1 March 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," WTF is wrong with you, Marvel?
","It is a good movie and they maneged to pack a lot of realy good stuff in there, But. Why such a rush suddenly? they milked most mediocre plots and villains for 10 years and almost 20 movies and then chew thru half of them in minutes. WTF? Did we realy need 3 irom man movies , ant-man, spiderman, black panther, all bbelow average movie so then just throw realy cool characters into a wood chipper?",7,2,14,26 April 2018
Room," Oscars for everyone!
","This is one of the most impressive movies I have ever seen. And it is not easy to impress me. The genre is psychological drama but really it is Not like anything you have ever seen. You know that you have something special when everyone is telling you that your movie is good and unique. The only movie i would relate it to as analogy- may be The Road. This picture is all about a struggle that mother and her child have VS cruel and constantly changing world. It is not actually about the abduction, it is more about growing up and adjusting to new world. For both mother and child. Despite the extreme circumstances of this story, it leaves you asking yourself are you really ever ready for pressure of raising a child? Dramaturgy here is maybe the best I have ever seen. Astonishing work on psychology and writing it into a simple but impressive form. Also incredible actors performance. You will shed a fair amount of tears but it will leave you with a good feeling.",9,0,3,6 March 2016
A Quiet Place," for the weak minded
",If you have an IQ of like 70 and just love trash thrillers maybe you will give this movie something above 4/10. For the others it's a waist of time. B-list actors with no real heart slowly moving along idiotic half a page screenplay. OMFG! whats considered a good movie now.,4,1,4,27 June 2018
Coco," Making the perfect weapon
","Despite the obvious following of the tear jerking formula, Pixar, makes you care every time. You can clearly see how they abuse same archetypes: family , children, dogs, death. Same plot twists of good guy turns out to be bad etc. You still totally lost in it and somehow care every time. Now they adopted 'disney singing'. you can see how they perfecting template of a weaponized tear jerking in a cartoon form. It is not nearly close to Wall-e or Up but as far away from Cars.",6,20,61,7 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," well, it's something. the start of new story line
","I am much more interasted now with public reactions to new SW, then movies themselfs. First reviewers were unhappy with milking of old story,and now with sudden twists. So there is no way to make them happy. As they couldn't shoot exectly same story forth time, they had to let it go and trust someone with new plot direction. The rules were:1. stratch the soap opera as far as u can 2. disney PG12 3.general SW theme of good vs evil and so on.
And so Johnson did. Bold plot twists, some action, some mystery. On top of that he tried to add some depth to the characters,sadly that did not go well with fans. I wish people would let go their nostalgia and hopes to relive their youth and embrace changes. On the other hand 2.5 hours dint get us anywere. Same problem with all franshises - nothing or no one in this movie makes you care. And after watching it, still hard to explain what exectly the story was here. I realy dont like when they make big movies with soap opera standarts of cliffhanger instead of the finished story.
Basicly rebels just running whole movie and dont get anywhere. Leia still playes no real role and kind of a place holder of a character. Even Snokes death looked more like an exident and definitly lacked dramatism. Also movie for no reson changes rythm and tone several times. Could have better fights, better dialog, better everything.
All in all movie is not bad and a step from the dead point. Hard to tell where, but a step.",5,1,2,20 December 2017
War Machine," Good satire. But
",It's a slow and a little bit underdeveloped satire on how everything is a nail for a hammer. it's a bit underdeveloped but i had fun watching it. my main beef with it is that they should have used more of the source or hired more writers. they aimed for new kind of blend- atmospheric satire. but they didnt show life on the ground enough for a real atmosphere or understanding why US forces are so wrong. also it lacks in satire department.,6,0,0,12 April 2020
Avatar," infomercial of a movie
",Do you like dragons? do you love alien movies? do you like Sigourney Weaver? Do you fall for classic gutter to hero story arc? well we got 3 hours of the most processed and basic trash you can wish for! Avatar. A movie made for the average gullible viewer. Movie you will forget the moment you will stop watching it. Yawn fest for anyone with an active brain. Or 8 stars for a dumb ass like it was aimed at. Script so primitive a 20 min episode of Rick and Morty is more complex then this 3 hour movie,3,1,4,30 October 2019
Joker," another fake rating pretentious marketing driven product
","The idea was not bad, but there is a long walk from good idea to something special. Well it is far away from it. Very artificial, totally cliche driven and blend. I am glad that i didnt have my hopes anywhere. If it wasnt so pretentious i maybe would give it 6/10. There are much better movies on both social order and outcast topic. Watch High-rise, watch Westworld, Psycho-pass, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, fight club... anything....",5,6,24,17 December 2019
Arrival," Good but lazy
","I strongly recommend reading the book first, you will loose nothing, just the opposite. It would help you understand what is going on. Movie touches the subject of 'First contact' and how it would change everything. It strongly points that with no common physcical or cultural background we would have a very tough time establishing any communication. It is some of the best hardcore science fiction in years but I can't get rid off the feeling that creators of this movie got lazy or out off budget at some point. 'Story of Your Life' by Ted Chiang was a short story in itself, but they managed to butcher it down even more! For what? It is still slow and almost meditative movie, what did they achieve by making it much more primitive story? They knew they were making slow science fiction movie and yet they cut all the interesting science and conversations from the book. The character of Jeremy Renner is more like a furniture in this version etc. Also I don't understand the deviation from the original story. They did not make it any stronger or action packed, they just made no sens. Movie is slow paced and focused on attentive audience, great soundtrack and very strong emotional story of main character going through some major revelations and transformations of her personality. Pepsi generation will say it's boring and makes no sens. I would say they are dumb.",8,0,4,1 February 2017
Parasite," 9? rly?
","Yes its a good movie but not nearly as good as Snowpiercer. That has lower rating for some unknown reason. Script is predictable and does not display any direct critique on the class conflict. so it could be easely missenterprited! The poor actually look unworthy in this supposed masterpiece. if thats not major flaw i dont know what is. acting is extrimply poor. camera -not bad but nothing special. overall ark is childish , no suspense or dramatic high points.",6,1,6,20 February 2020
Wonder Woman," it is like Trumps America
","how? Wonder Woman 2017 is 'all bragging and zero substance'. just like Trump! you know the feeling you get when you a watch a remake that was over-hyped but it's just an empty shell in fact. well that is what we got. Plot feels forced. Young God coming into a new world trying to save everyone and in the process disappoints in people. Sounds Familiar? That was full-on offensive trying to market this movie like something ground-braking in woman rights or first strong female character! No, guys... Really? Really??!! Facepalm. Poor story, poor characters, boring and uninventive. Nothing more to say.",4,15,38,2 June 2017
Marriage Story," fantastically balanced and pure of heart
","At the start i didnt like casting. who would ever believe in Driver -Johansson couple? Laughable. But the story, characters and performances made it all work. You would think that whole movie would be just a scam and a tear jerker. It's not. Goal was to make a point more then anything. How nobody is prepared for family to fall apart or dealing with lawyers. Really, with this topic been so overused in movies and TV it was surprising to come with something original and just so good. but it is even more. Tons of subtle jokes and observations. Super solid story, acting and even a whole musical number on top of it:) Bravo",9,5,8,10 January 2020
Black Panther," IMDB ratings are dead!
","Overhyped is not even the right word. fake reviews and fake ratings on essentialy very mediocre movie. there is absolutly nothing special about this movie. Two-dimentional charecters,no stand out action, but main problem is lazy wrighting! Why would you make it if you have almost nothing to say, and not even contrabuting anything to Infinity Stones story.
We would be much better off with Fury solo movie.",4,42,92,21 February 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Just a sequel
","I really liked Man of steel. It was almost like cinematic poetry. It had a story, well developed characters, good rhythm, impressive cinematography. BvS has none of that. Characters get no introduction, and one that was introduced is Ben... So you hardly care for any of them. Strange casting for all the roles and a very poor job on the script gives us Batman v Superman. Hardly believable behavior and dialog, totally ridiculous change of heart for batman in the middle of the fight v Superman. I demand my money back! Indignation is what you are left with. All this movie will show you is Wham! Slam! Kazam! That's pretty much it. PS I am pretty sure batman killed a lot of man in this movie, which is total blasphemyю",5,2,4,1 April 2016
Jojo Rabbit," imitating Wes Anderson
","Silly predictable movie. Does not capture imagination. And far from Wes Anderson talent. But I Liked it. whats more interesting is Scarletts career. Have you wondered how far a pretty face can get a girl? Pretty far. Damn Scarlett is a bad actor. you can easily see her looking with her soulless indifferent face at real corpses. If a 10 YO boy is a better actor then you. Oh, boy. You are bad.",6,1,3,4 February 2020
Moonrise Kingdom," I am not sure anyone is still capable of recognizing a masterpiece
","Even you with 7s and 8s. What exact beef or underperformance issue you see there? It is perfect in ever possible way! So many layers of meaning and jokes come together in one impossible blend. Best possible cast, perfect screenplay, perfect camera, perfect soundtrack. It is as close to real world magic as it gets! Movie is clearly for adults capable for self-reflection and irony. Not many of thous obviously left",10,0,0,29 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Meh
","Money rule the world. And once again they win over the basic artistic decency. Despite my very average expectations, movie was even more dull. Force awakens is not even a new movie. They just reworked parts of the original trilogy and put new title over it. We have New Darth Vader, New Death Star(bigger and deathier), New Droid , new father-son conflict and that is it. For fans pleasure the even got Ford and Fisher taken out of mothballs, but all for nothing. They just look old and lost, and add nothing to the movie. Movie shows almost all the old characters but since there was no story for any of them, half of them have practically no lines!!! WTF? Can you be more lazy? The Force Awakens must have been created with single purpose, sell old story once again. Shame on you!",5,153,291,17 December 2015
Deadpool," Superhero for thugs?
","If you just hate classic superheroes with their moral principles and good intentions, well I guess Deadpool was made for you. Obviously Marvel decided to cover teenage bully demographic and give them character that they can relate to. This intended to be an adult movie but it actually is more then any other marvel movie aimed on teenagers. There is no other audience that will be able to get anything from watching it. Very poor story, dumb characters, absolutely zero ideas, poor dialog and a bunch of toilet jokes that's it. They tried to make it funny but failed at that also. All the jokes are stupid and worst of all- not funny. This is first Marvel movie that I would not recommend seeing.",3,13,31,1 April 2016
Annihilation," usual hollywood blender of random stolen sci-fi
","They 'borrowed' from a lot of good sci-fi with no idea, thoght or sens ... just like alien life did in this movie. it is not horror its a poor art-hous on sci-fi topic. form over substance. random blender of stolen stuff . don't waste your time.
read stanislav lem's 'voice of god' or 'solaris' some sourses of theft))
i would recomend reading almost all of Lem",4,1,2,13 March 2018
