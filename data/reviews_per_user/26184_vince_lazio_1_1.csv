Sucker Punch," Surprised thriller A+!!!
","One heck of a thriller this movie is. After the first scene I was glued to my seat and wanted to know why,where,when will happen next. The music plays perfectly into the storyline and action scenes, which makes the film enjoyable. All in all a great film perfect cast and great acting,a for sure buy on DVD and will be watching this again and again! The action scenes are amazingly done and looks so real, also the ending to the film was a shock to me and I didn't like at all, but not in a bad way in a darn they should have all lived and had normal lives. All five girls play their roles good and nothing bad to say about any of the acting in this film as they all did a fantastic job. This movie is probably one of the best I have seen this year as movies these days are getting to be dull and it's great to have watched this film! Thank You!",10,7,13,26 June 2011
