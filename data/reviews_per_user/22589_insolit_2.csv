Deja Vu," Characters are made dumb, just like in horror movies and bad soap operas...
","I consider time-travelling movies particularly interesting most of the time. I like the idea of a bridge between past and present, that turns communication possible, as well as timeline branching. I can remember 'Frequency', that i found an amazing movie and recommend to those enjoying this subject. About this movie, there are a few things i particularly dislike. It's particularly annoying when characters are made stupid so that screenwriter get the story the way he wanted. Why was that paper sent to a place where Denzel would be just in that instant? After that 'forced failure', why didn't they try to send the paper once again to a place he could certainly see it... his home for example... didn't he ever go to sleep? Then to solve all the problems... it was made possible sending him to the past... well i can't comment on that, i'll just assume it as a possibility in movie's reality, though it would be kind of impossible to imagine it after so much trouble sending the mass of little sheet of paper. But even when he was sent to the past, after the girl's rescue, the screenwriter created suspense by making characters once again stupid and complicating everything. Why didn't Denzel try to contact ATF and just warn to abort that ferry travel so that they could safely dismantle the bomb, without risking all that people's life... Well i'll answer that, because screenwriter wanted to break people's heart after his death, just when love between he and 'Claire' (Paula Patton) had been set. And of course even more important was to make him appear once again, so that all people get happy again... I can't like movies that get their suspense or any other type of emotions, by turning characters dumb, this is usually done in bad horror movies. These and many other reasons don't make this movie a good reason to go to cinema. This is a Sunday's afternoon movie to watch with the family while pictionary is played, so that we don't take the movie too seriously.",2,95,170,28 January 2007
The Village," Poor story!
","It's really hard for me to find out, what's so special about this movie. There's nothing new about the plot... even in Big Fish we can find something allusive to the idea of people isolated from the rest of the society, expecting to get the perfect life.. The love story is not intense... there isn't any reason to get scared... But worst of all... really predictable... On opposite to the 3 other movies from this director, we can easily and very soon predict, what's supposed to be the great mystery of the story. By the way, i think these director's movies are decreasing in quality. Sixth sense was great, one of the best movies i've ever seen, with a huge impact. Unbreakable was also good... but not the same thing... These last two, Signs and now Village... but mainly village... are bad movies in my point of view. Well that's all i have to say... Bye all!",1,2,5,15 December 2004
