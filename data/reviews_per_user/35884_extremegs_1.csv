The Legend of Bagger Vance," Incredible, unique details made this a unique film
","This movie was very interesting. The only element that I felt should have been included was a greater assurance of the reunion of Junuh (Matt Damon) and Adele (Charlize Theron) at the end of the movie. The tragedy of their lost separation is felt quite vividly but the completion of their reunion was incomplete. It was slightly out of balance. The cinematography was very enjoyable though. With all this said, it was a worthwhile movie to invest my time in...enjoyed it thoroughly! The witty dialog deliverance of Will Smith combined with the young sweet character of the southern boy, Hardy Greaves (J. Michael Moncrief) is delightful. A must see!!",8,1,3,1 May 2006
