The Blair Witch Project," See it twice...
","Critics seem to love it, and the public seems to love it or hate it.It's the scariest movie I've ever seen.Watching these three students fall apart, and ultimately hearing Heather's animal-like screams as the camera slowly floats down to hell left me chilled to the bone.I'm glad someone made this movie and did it right, leaving in only scenes of good (and funny) acting and giving the right number of (very creepy) warning signs without giving too much away.Too bad this movie doesn't work for some people.  I wouldn't change a thing. It scared me senseless.",10,1,2,17 August 1999
