The Equalizer," Love Denzel in this!
","Love Denzel in just about everything & this did not disappoint! The movie may start out a bit slow, but stay with it! You will not regret it. This is one of the greatest action flicks I've seen in a while. Denzel is fighting for something and when he's playing a character that does that, I think it just makes him sexier, showing throughout that he does care for the few people in his life. He's very mysterious throughout the movie and the audience is left trying to figure out what exactly is in his past. This was certainly a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat, wondering what is coming next! I hope they made a sequel to this, I'll be in line!",10,0,3,10 January 2015
