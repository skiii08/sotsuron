The New World," The New World - Good or Bad ?
","Yo yo yo, I have watched films for years and know a lot about the meaning, making and general message that film makers try to convey. I have studied film studies in depth and understand every aspect of film-making, camera work, cinematography and editing and everything else. But 'The New World' just doesn't do it for me, it is too slowly paced and doesn't contain enough action.I must admit that this film conveys fantastic editing and camera work which works fantastically without the use of action and words, but the direction of the film lacks serious location. Sometimes, the film lost me in terms with understanding, but after seeing it, i had knew what it was about. My favourite actor is Colin Farrell and i wanted to see this film because of his role. But after watching this film, i was really disappointed in his role and the film as a whole. Maybe i expected this film to contain more action, fighting, and talking, but its main theme of silent imagery didn't do it for me. I don't think the quiet romantic role suited Colin Farrell, in comparison with his bad boy image and other roles in S.W.A.T, The Recruit, Phonebooth and his newer film Miami Vice which looks fantastic. This for me, decreased my overall enjoyment.The director did a wonderful job in terms of what he wanted to do, but lacked elements of description, explanation, action and amount of character conversation, which had a massive impact on my overall view. The film doesn't tell the audience how Smith ended up there, or anything about his life before. If you enjoy films with silent meaning, and like the element of love contained within, i would recommend this film, but to the average movie - goer, this film's a no-go. this is definitely a silent movie!Thanks for your time, regards, Chris wheeler x",3,0,4,25 June 2006
