Lucky Number Slevin," Save your money. Don't see Slevin!
","this movie was crap. almost entertainingly bad... how do a cast of star actors give such a lame performance? bad writing. I cant remember the last time I was so disappointed by dialog. Predictable plot twists, this film gives its audience NO credit. what should go without saying is over explained during the last 30 minutes. amateur cinematography. lame characters. no originality. BAD jokes. flat acting. ridiculous musical score. Hartnett's wardrobe consists of a towel for the first 40 minutes. speaking from a female perspective, flaunting buffed polished man meat around in soft focus doesn't excite me, I just find it tacky. and they lose my respect. this formula cult classic wannabe disappoints from all angles.",2,5,15,15 April 2006
