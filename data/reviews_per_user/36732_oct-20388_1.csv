Airlift," Gr8 movie
","Airlift is Akshay kumar's one of the best movie. Airlift is a movie about about how 1 lakh, 70 thousand Indians were safely moved out of war torn Kuwait in Year 1990.I don't like all songs. The film is based on the real-life conflict. Akshay Kumar is the most talented superstar of Bollywood.One of the finest films to come out of the Hindi film industry. Just do not miss this one.I suggest everyone should once go and watch this movie. This movie is based on a real life hero who came out to help his countrymen to escape when kuwait was invaded. He is the one who came out as a leader.",9,1,4,24 January 2016
