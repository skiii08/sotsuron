First Man," One Small Step for (a) Man, One Giant Leap for Mankind
","Absolutely wonderful masterpiece! A true triumph of ambition and human achievement delicately crafted around Neil Armstrong and his desire to master the unthinkable and unimaginable for this era of human history.If you have not seen this you need to watch! Like Now!Okay, let us start with some of the negative comments. First and foremost, Ryan Gosling plays a wonderful Neil Armstrong with his lack of emotion, Neil Armstrong separated himself from most people he loved dear and his fellow companions, this was wonderfully mastered. There was one objective on his mind the Moon. Second, the space odyssey drama was not as exciting as most think, most astronauts knew each other and NASA was in its infancy with space exploration. There were accidents on Earth and in Space, but the astronauts who survived added their input on how to fix problems as they arose. Space and going to the moon was not as easy as most make it appear, it was tough, very, very tough. Astronauts had various reasons for continuing and accomplishing their goal Neil's was his buddies and his daughter! I never cry for movies and one tear fell when everything culminates at the end and you finally understand the impact of accomplishing the unimaginable goal, the moon!Do not read the negative comments go experience this for yourself!",10,1,4,15 October 2018
