The Devil's Advocate," Al Pacino is terrific
","What a good movie, a script that makes you think of life and doubt your beliefs, performances by Al Pacino and Charlize theron that make you laugh , cry ,  get scared, and be amazed. On the other hand I don't know who chose Keanu for that part, next to Al Pacino all the weaknesses of an actor will appear.That role needed a really good actor, for e.g Daniel Day Lewis. After all I think it's a must see movie,I recommend it to everyone.",Null,0,1,16 February 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Let's face it , it was kind of disappointing
","Leaving the theatre from this movie I can see the disappointment in everone's faces , the only thing that kept us going through the movie was to watch the ending , and here it comes we're suddenly watching two people having a conversation like the ones we've seen in pulp fiction and reservoir dogs, no one wanted to see that especially in the ending scene of a revenge movie called kill bill.Both movies would have made one hell of a great movie , I still think the first one was a masterpiece, the second one really didn't live up to the expectations. And QT is one of these geniuses who should stay behind the scenes , he has no charisma to go out on interviews , he's just a silly geek who makes great movies.",Null,2,3,23 April 2004
Scarface," Al pacino at the top of his game
","If you like movies and you haven't seen Scarface yet,do it right now.Everything about this movie is the definition of greatness,especially Pacino's performance and Oliver stone's script.The best bad guy performance in the history of film making.It's a movie you got to have ,I've been looking for a copy for six months.",Null,0,1,16 February 2003
Memento," Genius
","This movie is definitely a new classic.A completely new idea( which is hard to find in movies these days).You can only know and see whatever the lead character knows or sees, and what makes more interesting is what the lead character knows.you have to see this movie to understand.One of the smartest movies ever.",Null,0,2,19 February 2003
The Pianist," the pianist
","a very good performance but the fact that this guy adrien brody won an Oscar for his performance while daniel day lewis , jack nicholson, and nicolas cage watching is a living proof that this business is controlled by Jews, no offense and i got no problem with that in fact i think they deserve it.",Null,0,1,30 March 2003
The Insider," I would've rather watched a documentary about this story
",Not every true story is suitable for a film.there's nothing in this story to fill a whole movie thats why it's that slow and boring.Good performances wasted on such a movie.I wish Pacino and Crowe will meet again in a better movie.,Null,0,1,19 February 2003
Gangs of New York," Scorcese insists on making his movies too long and too slow
","This movie had all the right pieces to be a new classic, it had the right setting,the right actors,and the right director.The only thing is that it's too slow,it's like you're watching a movie from the 70's,why do they still make movies this way?.But i think it's worth watching specially for the performance by Daniel day lewis,what a performance, he brings a completely new character to life, it's a classic performance that definitely should win an oscar, and should be compared to all the other classic performances like Marlon Brando's in the Godfather or Al pacino's in Scent of a woman , it's one of these performances.",Null,0,0,16 February 2003
