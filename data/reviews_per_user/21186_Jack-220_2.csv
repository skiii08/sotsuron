Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Character development and plot
","Before I saw the film I heard it was slow.   It was not. There is enough food for thought to go around and around the dinner table after the movie.I loved the plot (character) twist, and I spotted the 'bad man' half-way throughout the movie even though I'm not 'die-hard' Star Wars fan.I even have the plot in my mind (yeah, right), for Episodes II and III.  >",Null,0,0,5 June 1999
The Usual Suspects," Who said it was planned?
","The only thing I have to say about this movie is:Most people who are into it have had to see it at least 15000000 times.'Do you remember the cigarette lighter dropped at the beginning, and the one at the end?'?A hundred more.......I at least have seen it five or six times and come out with the characters having different roles.I love the ending that Spacy gives, about the devil.John",10,0,1,5 October 1998
