Scarface," One of a kind...
","Think back to the early 80's and the types of movies that were coming out at that time. Mainly you had typical heroes that triumphed over evil throughout the course of the film. That pretty much sums up hollywood film in the 80's. Yet SCARFACE takes that traditional role and turns it upside-down. It also set the precedent for the majority of 90's films.There's no need to describe Al Pacino's flawless acting in this film, you really have to see it to believe it. As for Oliver Stone's story, I am honestly surprised that he wasn't given more attention for it. Brian DePalma must have studied Kubrick's work closely, because that is what sealed it for me. DePalma's direction was so good, through numerous scenes of combining dreary music with long, drawn-out shots were unbelievable.You really can't help but love Tony Montana, his passion & lust for the American Dream along with his criminal roots that he can't shake. In the end, he pays the ultimate price, but does it in a way that any Cowboy or Soldier would. SCARFACE is not a nice movie, it is a movie that can be both beautiful & gruesome at the same time. Sort of like the United States don't you think? I will always think of this movie as being just what it is, one of a kind.",Null,0,0,31 August 1999
Memento," One of the most imaginatively unique films I've seen in a while...
","Imagine waking up in the morning and not being able to remember the things you've done or the people you've met. You can make new memories but you know that they will only last for the duration of that day. Such is the problem for Leonard, a man on a mission to solve a mystery that is consistently complicated by his own unique illness. Thats all I'm willing to disclose, the rest needs to be seen and make sure you pay close attention. Newcomer filmmaker Christopher Nolan has given us one the most imaginatively unique films I've seen in a while. Those of you who prefer straightforward Hollywood mainstream films might find a little trouble keeping up. But for those who enjoy mind-boggling, open-ended and totally unpredictable cinema, you definitely might want to check it out. And if you really enjoy it, as did I, then I also suggest taking a first, or second look at TWELVE MONKEYS, FIGHT CLUB, EXISTENZ, RETROACTIVE, DARK CITY, RUN LOLA RUN, and PULP FICTION. By the way, don't answer the phone.",Null,0,1,23 May 2001
He Got Game," By far Spike Lee's best film to date...
","I'd first like to start out by saying that I am not a big Spike Lee fan, but HE GOT GAME is by far Spike Lee's best film to date. Words cannot express the visual brilliance that the film possessed. It was like watching an urban street drama done by Stanley Kubrick, it was excellent! The acting was also great, with real & heartfelt performances by Denzel Washington and the rest of the cast as well. The story is at times decisive & intense but then switches to philisophical & ponderous. Also unlike his previous films: MALCOM X, CLOCKERS, etc., there is no racial or political agenda being force-fed on the viewer. Rather it gives a gritty, emotional story about a father & son in the backdrop of college basketball recruiting. Its a must see in my opinion!",Null,0,2,30 March 1999
The Shining," A horror masterpiece...
","What can really be said about the greatest horror film of all time? There is no doubt in my mind that this film, although made close to twenty years ago, still is the scariest movie I've ever seen. A lot of people would say that THE EXORCIST is, but I gotta stick with THE SHINING, no contest.But like THE EXORCIST, it creates the perfect atmosphere for a horror film. Fans of Stephen King have serious problems with this film, but they need to get over themselves. THE SHINING is Kubrick's movie and I don't think there is a single director who could've made it better. I've seen King's version on television and laughed through the whole thing, that's how inferior it was.A lot of people also had a problem with the slow pace & Mr. Nicholson's acting. Stanley Kubrick's technique of slow, drawn-out pace is absolutely necessary in a film like this as it was in BARRY LYNDON. It's used to absorb the viewer totally into the film and it's story. As for Mr. Nicholson's acting, how do you expect a man being confined in a large haunted hotel to behave? I think he did a great job, but the real praise I think belongs to little Danny.THE SHINING is a horror masterpiece, which is why I think, Kubrick didn't make any others; how would you top this? The story centers around a family struggling as caretakers of a huge haunted hotel. Although some people believe that THE SHINING is about the haunted hotel, I honestly focused more on the extreme cabin fever. I thought that the haunting was only secondary to the psychological deterioration of Jack Torrence. I seriously hope they decide to bring it back to theaters someday.****LONG LIVE THE SHINING****KUBRICK IS GOD****",Null,0,0,5 May 1999
Aliens," ..one of the most forgotten and under-rated sequels of all time
","This film happens to be one of the most forgotten and under-rated sequels of all time. For one simple reason: it totally diverges from the original. ALIEN was a sci-fi/horror film and ALIENS is a sci-fi/action film. In the first outing, you have a serial-killer type of alien that plucks off the crew members one by one and it is up to the feminist heroine Ripley to save herself and a stupid cat. Very predictable. In ALIENS, you have a whole mess of these aliens and they are thirsty for human blood, but who are their victims? Not some pathetic spaceship crew, the marines! They are here for one reason, to kick ass and take names. Their philosophy is simple: we may die, but if we do we are gonna take out as many of these creatures as we can. Where the original succeeded in its basic horror elements, the second one succeeds through taking these elements and adding to them nonstop battle and action sequences. What would you rather use to battle an alien? Your wits or a flame thrower duck taped to a machine gun/grenade launcher? Hmm, tough choice. Also I might add that throughout the film I had no idea who was going to die and who would survive till the end. In the future, Ridley Scott should stick to hardcore drama pieces like WHITE SQUALL and GI JANE. His sci-fi technique is just too slow and drawn out. With that, I think James Cameron should definitely make more films like this one and THE ABYSS, THE TERMINATOR 2, etc. He happens to be the only director that is responsible for two of the greatest sequels of all time! But of course let's not forget, we should give some credit to THE GODFATHER PT2 and THE ROAD WARRIOR.",Null,0,1,1 March 2000
The Fast and the Furious," If you are a guy who likes fast cars, look no further...
","I think a film like this is fairly unique especially today, because it doesn't beat around the bush, it gives you exactly what you want. And if you are a guy who likes fast cars, look no further. Sure the dialogue is cliched and the plot is amateurish, but who cares! A film like this allows you to forget its flaws as you are so wrapped up in the cars, the women, and the chases. Vin Diesel is great as always, Paul Walker was kind of stiff but then again most cops are. Now I loved Michelle Rodriguez in GIRLFIGHT, but here she was mainly used as eye candy. The chase sequences are some of the best I've ever seen, easily putting films like GONE IN 60 SECONDS and even THE FRENCH CONNECTION to shame. It offers little for women, old people, and those who follow all the traffic laws. But be warned: this film may cause you to drive a little faster and more reckless. Nitrous boosters rock!!!",Null,1,1,2 July 2001
Tigerland," ...could be a sequel to FULL METAL JACKET
","I had anticipated seeing this movie since I first heard about it last year, but it wasn't playing at any theaters near me. So I had to patiently wait for it to grace the local video store. I am honestly surprised that a film this good didn't get a wider theatrical release. Director Joel Schumacher has given us a gripping, raw war movie about a group of army soldiers and their experiences on their last stop before being shipped over to Vietnam.     These soldiers, some draftees and some volunteers, are the exact kind of youths that shouldn't even be there. But one of them, a non-conformist in every sense of the word, takes it upon himself to help those who need him. The film really could be a sequel to FULL METAL JACKET, but with a more character driven story, much like COOL HAND LUKE. The truth is you really don't see too many films like this any more. The kind of film that slaps you in the face with its raw intensity. I don't know how realistic this film is because I obviously wasn't there, but there are some damn talented actors here and the writing is top-notch.     Some War film buffs may be turned off by its anti-war undertones, but for those who enjoy the challenge and endurance of the human spirit, it's definitley one to check out.",Null,0,0,25 April 2001
The Transporter," Jason Staham finally makes his mark...
","Looking like a Brit version of Bruce Willis, Jason Statham made his debut back in Guy Ritchie's classic crime caper/comedy 'Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.'  Since then he has been given a few side roles here and there in 'Snatch' (or Lock, Stock 2 as I like to call it), John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars', and then he teamed up with Delroy Lindo to track two Jet Li's in 'The One.'  But who would've guessed that he finally got his own film, and a kick ass action film at that.  Ever since Corey Yuen and Luc Besson collaborated on 'Kiss of the Dragon,' I knew that any film they did together from then on would be golden. And 'The Transporter' definitely lives up to that standard. Sure there's nothing new here: how many times is a bad guy gonna get a change of conscience over a hot chick, right? And unlike the others, there is actually some good chemistry going on between our hero and his damsel in distress.  Basically, the film combines some great European atmosphere (The beautiful southern coast of France) with some incredible fight and action sequences. Corey Yuen could pretty much create a fight scenario out of virtually any environment. Now I know you could easily replace Staham with Jet Li, but you know what? He really proves that he can hang with the big boys in this film. I mean, he did ALL HIS OWN STUNTS. How awesome is that? Not even our great American action actors like Sylvestor and Arnold can say that. My only criticsim of the film is that I think they should of beefed it up a little bit and went for the R rating. Other than that I think it's a great little action/martial arts movie with a European flavor. It will definitely make you reminisce over the days when Van Damme and Seagal used to make great Action fliks. I can't wait to see what Turkish has in store for us next. Ladies and Gentlemen, a new action star has been born.",Null,0,0,25 April 2003
JFK," Conspiracy theories aren't that far-fetched after all...
","Director Oliver Stone tackles the biggest conspiracy theory of all time in this all-star cast, big budget production. It is not that easy to defend a theory like this, but Stone packs in a great deal of believable evidence to back his claim. The idea that there was more than one individual involved in the assassination of President Kennedy doesn't seem that far off the mark after viewing Stone's three hour plus masterpiece. Kevin Costner brilliantly plays District Attorney Jim Garrison, the only man in history to bring someone to trial for the murder of President Kennedy. The rest of the cast is great, I especially loved Joe Pesci and John Candy - two very different roles than what they were used to. What you may not read on the trivia section for JFK is that Martin Sheen did the voiceover narration for the film, he played President Kennedy in the TV series 'Kennedy' and in THE DEAD ZONE he plays a politician that faces an assassination attempt. JFK took two Academy Awards for best cinematography and best editing. These two awards were well deserved as Stone is now notorious for editing black & white sequences with color sequences which blend together beautifully. This film will always be a milestone, in my opinion, in risk-taking cinema. Whether you believe it or not, you have to give the man credit for going against the common ideology and making a bold statement that we don't have to believe everything we hear and we don't have to swallow everything whole, that it is good to question things no matter how tragic they are.

From Dusk Till Dawn," A superb horror flic..
","FROM DUSK TILL DAWN was to me a superb horror flic. Unlike many other horror films of its vampire genre, this movie actually had a good & believable story to it. To be perfectly honest with you, the movie was excellent way before the vampires even appeared. It seemed to be split into two movies really; First, a Tarantino-style outlaws on the lam movie, and then a Kurtzman vampire horror flic. All in all, the dialogue was fast-paced, the acting was good, and the special-effects were superb. Although I'm not a big Clooney-fan, I have to say he was perfect as Seth Gecko, the short-tempered convict. 'Psychos? Psychos do not explode when sunlight hits them, I don't care how crazy they are!!!",Null,0,0,11 April 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," A masterpiece.
","I am going to be very brief with my review. 2001 is a masterpiece. Plain and simple. Basically if you took a crazy dream of outer space, with Mozart & Plato, add that to a healthy portion of the Twilight Zone, you would have 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. You really have to watch it like looking at a painting by Dali or Picasso. A film to observe, ponder, and definitely appreciate. We still have yet to see an outer space film that even comes close to 2001. A film from one of the greatest visionaries & film-makers of all time. An under-rated director that will always be remembered & immortalized through his art.",Null,0,2,1 April 1999
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Giving your first love a second chance...
","The latest film from the mind of Charlie Kaufman is filled with experimental techniques and delivers a universal message about first love. Now I loved Being John Malkovich because it was so different and endlessly interesting, yet I hated Adaptation because it practically put me in a coma. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, the title taken from an Alexander Pope line and recited by a stoned Kirsten Dunst in the film. Michel Gondry has directed such a surreal and dreamlike journey through the mind and memories. I'm not even going to bother summarizing the plot because it is quite complicated and you just have to see it for yourself. What I will say is that Jim Carrey has once again amazed us with his acting abilities and has shown us a quieter, lonelier side to him. Kate Winslet was the perfect actress for this part, the two of them have created one of the most realistic relationships I've seen on film in a long time. The film demonstrates how as much as we want to forget a troubled relationship, the good memories, no matter how few and far between, are what really shines above the rest. In the end the film poses the question, 'What if we were given the chance to start all over again with our first love, knowing how it ended and why it ended, would we do it?' And instead of leaving the answer up to us, Kaufman brilliantly comes right out and says, 'Yes we would!' He says we would because a chance to relive all those good memories is worth it. This film hit pretty close to home with me because I experienced a first love somewhat similar to theirs and I'm sure that I am not alone on that. It's a wonderful film that reminds us just how special our first love really is.",10,0,1,11 February 2005
Casino," A brilliant masterpiece by far....
","There's not much one can say about perfection and greatness which definitely go hand in hand with CASINO. Marty Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi have struck gold once again in this tale of power, lust, and greed in the adolescent Las Vegas of the 70's. The rise and fall of the mafia's strong-hold in Las Vegas is told brilliantly as if its the Holy Roman Empire. Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci together again, what more do you need? Now I loved the voiceovers in GOODFELLAS because it kept a good pace going in the film. Same goes for CASINO, along with excellent cinematography and lighting. Some scenes may be a little too gory for some viewers, but I loved them, it really made the atmosphere more intense and raw. I've heard different responses to Sharon Stone's character, I thought she did a really good job, it's hard to get engrossed in a shallow, heartless role like Ginger. This definitely goes down as one of my all time favorites, a brilliant masterpiece by far. '....And one by one the dominoes began to tumble....'",Null,1,1,2 March 1999
True Romance," A hard-hitting movie with a John Woo ending even Shakespeare would love...
","Ah, True Romance, what a truly excellent film, I don't even know where to begin. The dialogue alone is worthy of an Oscar in my opinion, from Elvis to Sonny Chiba, Sicilians and Charles Bronson, this movie has it all. Although it's not for all tastes, the main characters are a loser and an ex-call girl who somehow find each other under crazy circumstances, the story will definitely keep you watching. The ensemble is chock full of actors in roles you would never guess, Brad Pitt as a pothead, Gary Oldman as a pimp, as well as terrific performances from all. To me this movie combined some of Tony Scott's best direction and Tarantino's best writing.  To sum it up: It's a hard-hitting movie with a John Woo ending even Shakespeare would love; IT KICKED ASS.",Null,1,3,28 February 1999
Goodfellas," The penultimate mafia flick
","First let me just say that GOODFELLAS is not only the best of its genre, but also my favorite movie overall. I've seen it about over a dozen times and can never get enough of it. Martin Scorsese is a master at telling Nicholas Pileggi's true-story novel about Henry Hill, a man who grew up in a Mafia family only to sell them out in the end.Secondly, the acting in this movie is equal to the story and direction, its superb! Robert DeNiro is excellent in a secondary role as the ruthless Irishman Jimmy, who's character I might add is up for parole in about 15 years. Ray Liotta is also very impressive as Henry, and I can't forget Joe Pesci who pretty much stole the spot as the insane/psycho Tommy.Lastly, I just wanna speak a little on the film overall. It in no way tries to whitewash the mafia scene like the GODFATHER movies, rather it gives you a look inside, at its rawest. The scenes of violence in this movie will blow you away and they give the movie a strong sense of realism. By far Martin Scorsese's best film to date, combining great actors, a story that will definitely keep you watching > loved the voiceovers, and probably one of the best depiction of real-events I've ever seen on film. CASINO is also highly recommened!",Null,0,0,26 March 1999
