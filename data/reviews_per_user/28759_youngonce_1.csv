Lucky Number Slevin," constant violence, profanity & graphic sex
","I am not normally a prude nor have a weak stomach. But, this movie was advertised as a 'thriller comedy'. I was expecting something like the delightful 'Inside Man'. Instead, from the moment the credits opened brains and blood were spattering close range and continued throughout the movie. The two sex scenes were close up and graphic. The language throughout was filled with unnecessary obscenities.I will concede that the story line was excellent. The idea of mistaken identity was carried through with sufficient suspense to keep you guessing. I loved the way it all tied together at the conclusion but the presentation was just too gross for my tastes. Sorry folks.",1,7,32,23 April 2006
