Casablanca," What is everyone's fascination with this movie?
","This is quite possibly the slowest, and least interesting movie I've ever seen. I compare it to a long episode of some fifties soap opera. It has very little interesting twists in plot, and the characters are not in the least bit intriguing. Its a movie that house wives are interested in. Before u get to mad at me, i am a huge fan of classic movies, in fact, one of my favorite movies is 'Touch of Evil'. But that movie is 100 times better than Casablanca. I just wish that Orson Welles would get more credit than Bogart ever did. At least Welles directed his masterpieces. I'm sure that this post will anger some people, but I'm intitled to my opinion. But if you like Casablanca, and you've never seen 'Citizen Kane' or 'Touch of Evil' you have no idea what you've been missing",Null,2,7,16 September 2004
To Kill a Mockingbird," One of, if not the greatest statements on race
","If any movie deserves a 10, this one is the most deserving. Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch was the most moving and brilliant performances of his career. And the statement made in this movie is one that should not be taken lightly. It shows the ignorance of people and the pain it inflicts on the innocent. I personally feel that this movie should be the #1 movie on the top 250, but thats just me. And for it to come out when it did amongst segregation in the south was a statement for change in the country. So, if u read my post and agree with me, give this movie a 10, if u haven't seen it, do, and judge for yourself. I've seen most of the movies on the top 250, but give me suggestions.",10,0,3,16 September 2004
