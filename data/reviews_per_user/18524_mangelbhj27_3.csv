Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Genius!
","After seeing this movie and practically falling in love with it, I hate to hear that an entire country is suing Sacha Baron Cohen. Clearly it is a film that is fictitious in plot. Although the country of Kazachstan exists, I find it ridiculous that anyone could absolutely BELIEVE that the people of Kazachstan are anything like that. The people are depicted that way in order to favor Borat's character. Movies are made about America all the time with fictitious presidents and people. I don't see any Americans suing a filmmaker because they were insulted by a stereotype. This film is very poignant and it reveals more disturbing things about America than it does about Kazachstan. I'll be honest. I actually had to ask a friend if Kazachstan was real because I didn't know how real Borat was going to be in the movie. Knowing that it is a real country just makes it funnier. I wish they did not feel so insulted by this film. If anything, now more people are aware of its existence. I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. ESPECIALLY PARTISANS! I was more insulted by things said by Americans in the film. I was only humorer by anything relating to Kazachstan. There's such a thing as suspension of disbelief. People should walk into EVERY movie with that suspension. I hope everyone, if they don't love it, at least understands what this movie is about. As humorous as it is, it is really very deep. It doesn't leave room to dwell on petty things such as, 'the people of Kazachstan could really use an education,' because it's not about that and it never makes it a subject. Watch it when it premieres. You'll see what I'm talking about.",10,6,29,13 October 2006
Terminator Salvation," How could you not appreciate this film?!
","I'm sorry I just read one of the critiques on this page panning this movie from the acting to the CGI. This movie far exceeded my expectations. I'm not going to say it's THE summer blockbuster of 2009 but it definitely makes the list of top 5 coming out this year. T4 was able to pick up from T3 without bringing in any of the suckage that was T3. We finally get a chance to meet a few characters that have been the foundation of the Terminator series despite their limited screen time. All around I felt that a great choice was made in casting Kyle Reese and that Christian Bale perfectly embodied the John Connor we first met in T2. Definitely not the sissy that John Connor from T3 was. The incorporation of Marcus as a hybrid between machine and human helps to carry the story and answers several questions that viewers have been asking for over 2 decades. Definitely go out and see this film and form your own opinion. But I can guarantee that this movie is worth seeing and a wonderful addition to the Terminator films. In fact, if you just pretended T3 never happened and went on to see T4 the entire movie would still make perfect sense and would only bring with it his love interest from the 3rd film. Go see it and enjoy. They bring in some great lines, and really interesting moments. Possibly the only thing that doesn't make sense is that Skynet seems to have selective hearing. But who can't appreciate a little suspension of disbelief every now and again? Make sure you post what you thought. I can't imagine that everyone will hate this movie as much as some people.",8,3,7,25 May 2009
Up," I was a mess throughout the whole film
","I don't think I've EVER watched an animated film that made me sob while at the same time making me feel a whole rush of emotions that I've never felt all at once.It's a story of unfulfilled life, of love, of second chances. I'm a girl and even I feel like a darned chick for loving this film so much.I definitely wouldn't call this the type of film that children will fully appreciate. I should know because I watched it in a theater filled with them and theirs were the driest eyes in the house.It's not to say that there is adult content but simply themes and concepts that kids won't fully understand. They'll love the 3D, and the gags with Kevin and Russell and Dug but it's more over a film that adults of all ages will come to relish.I loved this film and I dare you to hate it. Disney has a way of pulling at my heart strings. I hope you can enjoy the same experience.",10,2,4,30 May 2009
