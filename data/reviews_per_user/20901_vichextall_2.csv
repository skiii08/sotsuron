It," Not bad
","A good attempt at a remake. Not creepy enough really, too many jump scares attempted and the clown 'wobbling' up to the camera wasn't great; it felt a bit cheesy. I think the clown showed too much of himself too early on.A lot of good stuff though, worth watching.",7,1,1,1 November 2017
Wonder Woman," Pretty good!
","Gal Gadot, gorgeous. Wonder Woman, gorgeous too ;-)Didn't like some of the CGI on WW's face in the scenes with the whip on the soldiers, was noticeably fake. Very cheesy dancing and then starting snowing. Even cheesier sun rising near the end of the film. Come on Hollywood, sort that sh*t out.Overall though, entertaining and amusing romp.Dianna Prince, gorgeous three... ;-)",8,2,7,1 November 2017
