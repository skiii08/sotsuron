Resident Evil: Afterlife," Resident Evil lumbers toward a 5th film much like one of it's brain dead zombies
","I am a fan of simple and streamlined story telling; so I enjoyed the first movie in the Resident Evil franchise which came out in 2002. The story was easy to follow and enjoy - killer day at the office when all of the employees of the evil multi-national Umbrella Corporation are killed and turned into zombies by a super virus. Survivors and rescuers must fight their way out. I was totally there. I was not such a fan of the second movie and pretty much ignored the third except for a glimpse here and there on cable.My desire to check out 'Resident Evil: Afterlife' was driven by being a sometimes but enthusiastic Milla Jovovich fan ever since first seeing her in the dazzling, hyper-kinetic, Jean- Paul Gautier drenched movie 'The Fifth Element'. For her fans I have some good news and bad news. You will see a lot of her in 'Resident Evil: Afterlife', including, I counted, 11 clones in the opening scenes, but not much of her acting skill. My first big complaint is that she is nothing more than post-apocalyptic eye candy to fill the space between supposedly impressive 3D effects. I was hoping this movie would have the pre-requisite amount of zombie action sprinkled with dark humor and basically repeat the first movie because repetition is not always a bad thing. Nope. Instead there are 97 minutes of what feels like nothing except set up for a fifth movie. Sure there is a story (loosely) where Alice encounters a group of survivors but some of them are so expendable and clich√©d they are a waste of time. It all moves too fast and there is never a connection.I don't know what to say about the 3D, really. There was some stop action moments which if you took the time examine them were visually trippy and interesting but they were overshadowed by the multitude of slow motion fight sequences which were over wrought and boring. So much slow motion in fact that I began to wonder if someone had slipped a Valium into my blueberry slushy(?). Not to mention that this over used effect turned the big bad villain into a tired Agent Smith impersonation. In the end Alice and her cohorts are on a giant ship full of survivors who look like they work for an Apple store in 2020. An army of black clad Umbrella agents are on the way promising an overblown and empty showdown for the next movie. A funny note. Even though I am sure most of the audience, like myself, were heading to the restrooms, we all turned back to the screen like cattle for a super special bonus scene at the end. That's the last slight of the movie because I did not even know who the female villain reveal was until I got home and Googled it. Shame on them. Don't do that people who have to pee.",4,2,5,19 September 2010
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," At least I got to see trailers for Tron and The Last Airbender
","First off, thanks to Staceybon from Twitter for helping me come up with a one word description for 'Prince of Persia'. You see, I thought I would be clever and asked for suggestions about what to call a movie where you ultimately enjoy the trailers more than the movie. She cut right to the chase with a concise and easy to remember answer - 'crap!' Does 'Prince of Persia' deserve to be called crap? I think to do so will at least nod toward the fact that some of these big blockbuster type movies are trending toward being unforgettable and unsatisfying. Don't worry 'Iron Man II' I'm not talking about you but yes 'Clash of the Titans' I am talking about you. I guess now I need to justify such a lukewarm response to Prince of Persia...I was never any good at video games although I did have a good run at Frogger one time. My characters are klutzes who bump into things and die in embarrassing and shameful ways. Based on all of the jumping, leaping and wall climbing involved in 'Prince of Persia', I am sure I would have sucked at the video game the movie is based on. This story is set in the sprawling empire of Persia and is about Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) who was adopted by the King and rescued from the life of a street urchin. This happens because like most movie orphans Dastan practically glows with spunk and virtue that the King may see missing in his own over privileged family. The downside of this situation is that eventually somebody is going to try to discredit and/or kill you. When the King is killed, Dastan is framed and finds himself on the run with the most beautiful princess in all of Persia (Gemma Arterton as Tamina). She is no ordinary bare belly Persian princess though because she is the sacred protector of a dagger that contains the 'sands of time' which can turn back time. While on the run we get all of the expected video game like action, effects like Dastan using the dagger and snarky flirting between Dastan and Tamina. It's the type of flirting that really begs 'get a room' or in this case a tent but never rises to the level of passion implied later in the movie.The plot really fails when there is exposition about what to do with the dagger. There is a source for the sand but putting the dagger there will lead to very, very bad things, It can be returned to the stone from which it was made or ( and this is where I checked out) there is a secret fortress where it can always be kept safe. OK, why not keep it at the fortress to begin with? Also we only see one other person besides Dastan use the dagger and why not? Couldn't said brave princess use the dagger's power to keep it from being capture to begin with? Oh well, we end up with a huge finale full of sand, fire and death that leads to......wait for it.... a big fat reset button that renders all we have seen moot. Good points? The scenes of vast deserts and Persian palaces are done well. Alfred Molina and Ben Kingsley can go to the head of the class because they play their one note characters well. Molina is used for quite a few laughs and Kingsley arches his eyebrows in just the right deceptively evil way throughout the movie. I've read that Jake Gyllenhaal's nicely buffed up body might be a reason to pay up and see this movie. I prefer leaner Brokeback Jake, and I don't think the abs factor even makes this movie worth the price of admission.",4,3,6,16 June 2010
Pirate Radio," In this case, feel free to rock the boat
","I don't know if the movie, 'Pirate Radio' is on people's radar but I would recommend checking it out. The DVD release date is not until mid April but you can find it airing right now via Comcast On-Demand. As a self describe anglophile, I cannot resist movies filled with quirky British characters and was pleasantly surprised at the chance to see it earlier than expected.It is a coming age fable of sorts about young Carl ( his nickname throughout the movie) who after being kicked out of boarding school is sent by his mother to spend time with his godfather ( the always incredible Bill Nighy as Quentin) in the mid 1960's. The twist is that Quentin runs a pirate radio station off the coast of England and Carl finds himself at the very center of the sex, drugs and rock'n roll generation. As Carl navigates his way through becoming an adult we are also given glimpses of Sir Allister Dormandy, a British government official, who is obsessed with shutting down any and all pirate radio stations ( if you see this movie, do you think it is a coincidence that our villain bears a striking resemblance some sort of pasty faced British version of Hitler?). He is given some of the more over the top lines too. Describing the country's rock'n roll fans as, 'drug takers, law breakers and bottom bashing fornicators'. I'm still trying to figure that last one out.This is all pretty standard fare for a movie about youthful rebellion through music. For the most part this movies has great laughs only faltering during some 'American Pie' type silliness about Carl loosing his virginity. It's at it's best though when the music does the talking. We are treated to various whimsical scenes of Brits from all walks of life dancing to some of the great rock classics. I called this a fable and I'll leave it to viewers to sort of historical accuracy, but just don't buy into the movie's conceit that it is about real events. It's more about capturing the mood of a time and place.",8,0,2,14 March 2010
Shutter Island," Crazy is catching
","## This does contain information that could be considered 'spoiler'ish##The set up: Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo are federal marshals sent in 1954 to the dark and foreboding Shutter Island to investigate the near impossible disappearance of a patient from the island's asylum for the criminally insane. It soon becomes clear the staff is as suspect as the patients and that DiCaprio may actually be right when he jokingly says insanity is contagious.The good? So much has here has been done right. The mystery quickly grows with so many possible explanations to pick from. Is it supernatural? Could the ghost Dicaprio's dead wife literally be helping him solve the mystery? A government conspiracy? Continuation of Nazi experiments? There are some beautifully shot dream/hallucination scenes infused with drama and emotion by superb acting on the part of DiCaprio and Michelle Williams who plays his dead wife. The script is smart, clever with comments on the horrors of war and how the view of humanity was altered by assembly line like mass murder of the Holocaust. DiCaprio is the center of this drama in ways you will only realize at the end but the rest of the cast is equally adept. ##Spoiler## The bad? I guess I should give the obligatory spoiler alert here...Half way through the movie I began to suspect where it was going to end and said a little prayer to the movie gods that it not be true. In the post Sixth Sense era, moviegoers have been, in my opinion, deluged with movies that abuse the 'twist' ending. Often it is just lazy storytelling rather then a clever trick. It was not until later that I found out Shutter Island is based on a book; so my one big criticism does not really add up to too much. Rather than a conscious decision by Scorsese, the ending is consistent with the book. What is the twist? Don't worry I won't tell but let's just say that doctors on Shutter Island have some pretty progressive treatment methods.One last note, when Brittany Murphy died, I saw someone online post, 'who is going to play the crazy girls now?' I nominate Michelle Williams because in Shutter Island she plays crazy in ways that are scary good.",9,5,12,23 February 2010
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Twilight: New Moon - a tale of shirtless boys and mopey girls
","Early in 'New Moon', Edward, having decided to leave Forks with the Cullen clan in tow, tells Bella 'Don't do anything reckless'. I wondered if he remembered who he was talking to. This is Bella Swan, Forks' resident lady of infinite sorrows who exudes teen angst from her pores. Of course she goes off the deep end. After a reasonable period of music video like moping, she realizes that she can have visions of Edward if she is in danger. Don't worry, this is based on a Twilight book, so the self destructive behavior stays in reasonably safe teen territory - motorcycle riding and cliff diving. The visions themselves are a bit awkward. Done in an Obi- Wan sort of way, Edward delivers wooden lines that might as well be 'Fasten your seat belt' or 'Don't play with matches'. Relief is on the way though. Bella develops a deep bond with friend Jacob Black ( Taylor Lautner). This relationship is soon on the rocks too when it appears that Jacob has dropped Bella to join a homo-erotic, Native American, Abercrombie & Fitch gang ( now that is a mouthful). It turns out his secret is a bit more mundane, at least for Forks. He is from a long line of werewolves who protect humans from vampires. Events conspire to bring Edward and Bella back together and we are all set up for her having to choose between the two.This has been written with tongue firmly in cheek mainly because I recognize that I am not exactly the target audience for these movies. I can appreciate them in some ways but ultimately find the Lifetime movie teen melodrama a bit heavy. I have not read the books, so I may be wishing in vain but I do have a list of things I would like to see more of in the future movies:(1) Let the adults come out and play more often. The scenes set in Italy featuring the 'vampire council' were really good. I can never get enough Michael Sheen ('The Queen', 'Frost/Nixon', 'Underworld', 'Alice in Wonderland') who literally chews up the scenery as Aro.(2) More vampires and more vampire action! Dakota Fanning as bloodthirsty psychopath = good thing (Yes that's her all evil and red-eyed in the above trailer). Victoria becoming an actual threat would be nice. Oh, and the tourist 'buffet' was a great touch.(3) Let Kristen Stewart have some range. Reviews of 'Twilight' often take shots at Kristen Stewarts acting. I don't know how much of that is based on her mumbling, deep sighs acting style in Twilight but she has done much better. I would suggest checking out 'Speak' (2004), 'The Cake Eaters' ( 2007) and 'Adventureland' ( 2009). OK I might be fooling myself because there is a Bella Swan in all of her roles.(4) Get rid of Bella's almost invisible friends from school or use them more. They appear to be starring in 'Degrassi Jr. High' while Bella is in a big teen blockbuster. Hello, producers you have an Oscar nominee in the cast now - Anna Kendrick. Certainly she can be used a bit more than a couple of scenes where her main role is to roll her eyes and look at Bella like, 'how did I end up with this freak as my friend'.'Twilight: Eclipse' is out later this summer; so let's see if this story can mature a bit along with the characters.",6,5,9,23 March 2010
Clash of the Titans," Epic Failure
","With a title like this I had better have some reasons for really not liking 'Clash of the Titans'; so here is my best attempt to list my disappointment:-I wanted more Greek gods. The opportunities thrown away by not using even Hera are mind boggling ( to me).-A messy miss mash of throw away characters. I never connected with Perseus whose angst should be driving the story. Andromeda is boring although I did enjoy her drunk father and drag queen like mother. Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't 'the end is near' prophet in Argos remind you of someone who was headed to Bannaroo and took a wrong turn?-Clunky special effects. I am not an expert on this. When effects are done well, I know it and enjoy. When they're not I recognize that too. Large scale CGI like the Kraken looked good but smaller effects like Medusa didn't blend well. Worse yet, on the ferry ride to the underworld, Charon ( hope I have that right, anyway the guy guiding the ferry) looked practically animatronic.-Too much action at the expense of story. I hardly felt we were in the theater for 118 minutes because one fast action sequence moved quickly to another with very little downtime. I need the downtime if not to connect to the characters, then to at least feel that I am watching real people act and not just a CGI fest.OK, there it is. I'm pinning my hopes on next week's 'Kick-Ass' for a good movie experience.",6,2,6,2 April 2010
Alice in Wonderland," Alice gets her groove back
","I am going to start off with a bit about my movie experience before moving on to 'Alice In Wonderland'. I knew I was seeing a PG movie but was dismayed by the number of Cartoon Network commercials I was seeing in the 20 minute land of the lost before the movie starts. The low point was a Pinocchio rip-off called Veggie Tales : Pistachio (ugh!). I reminded myself that this was a Tim Burton movie; so that had to count for something.The Set Up : I am not as familiar with the original Alice stories as I may have once been but it appears Tim Burton has went with a mix of elements from the original Alice, Through the Looking Glass and Carroll's wonderfully senseless poem Jaberwocky (all sprinkled lightly with some Chronicles of Narnia action). We first see Alice as a young girl asking her father if she is bonkers because she has been dreaming about falling down a rabbit hole and talking animals. He reassures her with a famous line about all the best people being bonkers. We find Alice next as a 19 year old girl with a dour mother ( Dad has died), and she is being dragged to a afternoon party where there is a trap of sorts. She will be proposed too by a pretentious dorky sort from the upper-class who cautions Alice 'when in doubt, be quiet'. This is all of the classic recipe for the female empowerment story that will take place when Alice runs away and falls down the rabbit hole ( is it just me or can you not read that phrase without thinking about drugs?).The Good: Once in Wonderland we are met with all of the characters that have become part of our cultural landscape. When first seeing trailers, I was worried the movie was too much about Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter but it isn't so. Everybody in Wonderland gets there screen time and uses it well. Tweedledee and Tweedledum are at times laugh out loud funny, the Blue Caterpillar is wise ( and yes he smokes a hookah but we're not told what's in it??), and the Cheshire cat is clever in spades. I have read that the Helen Bonham Carter steals the show as the Red Queen and I agree. She is a storm of what we might term passive aggressive behavior with plenty of 'off with their heads' I'm glad Depp has a more scaled back performance that may have been expected. My opinion is that this was on purpose because there were a lot of people left with a queasy feeling over the wild eyed androgynous Willy Wonka . It is through Depp though that Burton most delivers his dark take on Alice. The Mad Hatter's madness is one rooted in sadness and a manic desperation due to his beautiful world being warped by the Red Queen.The Bad: I don't know if the blame belongs with Tim Burton or Disney but outside of Wonderland the story does seem trite. The ending especially seems rushed and too typical. Alice quickly deals with all of her non Wonderland problems and even finds prospects of future independence in a career and this is all in the last 5 minutes ( it seemed). Tim Burton has made his mark on the world by letting people who might see the world a bit askew that it's OK and to compromise any of that would not be a good thing.",9,10,19,7 March 2010
Up," The animated movie continues its evolution
","I found some things to poke fun at in 'Up' ,but I'll start out though with a little gushing praise. Pixar has produced a complex story that blends heartfelt sincerity with the illogic and humor available in animation. I won't bore you with a plot description because I imagine everyone is familiar with the story of Carl Frederickson and his improbable journey to Paradise Falls. In a sequence completely absent of dialogue (think Wall-E) we are shown the complete life of a marriage that includes a miscarriage and the eventual death of Carl's wife, Ellie. This portion alone could have been an amazing short film. Once Carl has teamed up with the ever helpful Wilderness Scout, Russell, we are treated to a more conventional Pixar with the happy ending right around the corner.Here is my, 'What I learned from Up' list:-Due process does not exist in a Disney/Pixar world. Carl accidentally commits what would be a minor crime one day and the next he is kicked out of his home and somehow forced to move to the friendly neighborhood old folks home.-When going on an adventure, always go armed, but if a Disney movie make it something non lethal like pepper spray. You never know when you might run into a childhood hero turned madman.-When a talking dog says, ' I was sleeping under your porch because I love you' it's funny. If a person says that to you, call 911.-Russell, as cute as he is, appears to be at risk for juvenile diabetes.-It's ugly when really really old guys try to fight each other.",9,0,1,10 March 2010
Crazy Heart," Misery and music.
","'Crazy Heart' had a lot of hype to live up to with all of the praise during the awards season and Jeff Bridges best actor Oscar win. Bridges plays the aptly named Bad Blake who despite a promising country music career is close to hitting rock bottom when the movie opens. He plays gigs in bowling alleys, drinks non stop and probably wakes up most mornings next to an aging groupie he does not even remember. Bridges flawlessly abandons vanity and lets his body show every indignity this type of lifestyle would bring to someone his age. The movie charts his doomed relationship with Jean, a journalist played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, and an eventual rise back to professional success and sobriety. I am a huge fan of Maggie Gyllenhaal but in this role I wonder what direction she was given or personal choices she was making, Her character is so vague that at the end of the movie, I could not have really have explained why she became involved with Bad so quickly or why she doesn't give him a second chance. My most pointed criticism is for a last minute ploy that is supposed to drive home that Bad does not have many chances left. This comes in the form of him loosing Jean's young son in a public place. It's done in a clumsy and not very realistic way that smacks of 'after school special' and is totally unneeded. We got the 'he's an alcoholic' point the first three times he threw up in a trash can or toilet. My verdict is that Jeff Bridges was incredible at what he did but the movie itself was flawed by formula plotting.",7,2,3,19 April 2010
The Blind Side," Big issues in a little movie
",I don't have too much to say about ' The Blind Side' . Sandra Bullock looses herself in the role of Leigh Ann Touhy who practically adopts a young African American teenager and takes him off the path to becoming a sad statistic and puts him on one to success. She does this through a shock and awe campaign of southern charm and sassy attitude ( having a boatload of money doesn't hurt). Her character looms so large in the movie as to eclipse everyone else even Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) who you would have thought would be the center of the story. I like many others was taken in by Bullock's performance but for all of the attention 'The Blind Side' received it was a pretty lightweight movie.,7,0,0,28 April 2010
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Third time is not the charm.. but only 1 more to go at least..
","After seeing 'Twilight: Eclipse' I had to watch a whole block of 'Tru Blood' episodes just to remind myself that vampires are sexy, dark and bloody. I am going to leave you with just a couple of thoughts about why I am saddened by the decision to see this one in the theater, a mistake I assure I will not make for the fourth. Robert Pattinson would rightly be said to carry the burden of male vampire sex appeal in this series. With that in mind, perhaps someone should have pointed out that a scrunched up 'I small something nasty' face is not sexy especially for two hours. I recently saw him in 'Remember Me' which exceeded expectations and I must say he played the dark, brooding but always earnest bad boy very well. While were on this subject we might as well go ahead and say that Taylor Lautner's shirtless, 'well defined' (bad pun, sorry) acting style in 'Eclipse' tipped over into cheesiness of the worst sort. In a moment of self referencing humor, Edward even quips, 'Does he own a shirt?'. 'Eclipse' does offer up more action but undercuts itself with some not so special effects not to mention the fact that Twilight vampires when killed look like nothing more than empty mannequins. Maybe this is in line with the books, I don't know, but it was bloodless (even for PG13) and cold. The villain we have been waiting on in the form of Victoria once again has scant screen time and (spoiler!!) dies one of the cold, bloodless deaths. Can someone also explain Bryce Dallas Howard's bad choice of wigs? I did say just a couple of thoughts so I will leave you with my last complaint. Bella's fragile nature is played up to the point of absurdity. She really needs to be made into a vampire before she dies in some horrible toe stubbing accident.",5,5,7,14 July 2010
Up in the Air," George Clooney can even make getting fired sexy
","Sometimes I just know from the first trailer that I am going to love a movie and this was the case with 'Up in the Air'. George Clooney in the guise of Ryan Bingham plays my favorite type of movie character - he is jaded, disconnected and likes it that way. He travels constantly and has it down to a science; so much so that I would say he is a airport screener's wet dream. His job is to travel around the country and fire people for upper and middle management types who can only be described as spineless. Sound depressing? It's not for him. He dreads spending time at home and has become a legend at the art of firing people. He gives his victims a short speech about how life has handed them an opportunity to follow their dreams, pats them on the head and sends them on the way. We are given a brilliant montage of reaction shots with the actors looking directly in the camera. My favorite is who I will call the 'fuck you' lady who deserves some sort of Oscar. In his defense thought, you do feel that Ryan is not just spouting Oprah pop psychology and really believes the 'follow your dreams' speech.Since we meet him at the height of his game, we know he is in for a fall. This comes in the form of two women who in my opinion steal the movie. The first is Natalie (Anna Kendrick who is totally wasted in Twilight by the way) who threatens to ground Clooney by having possibly the worst idea in corporate history - cut down on travel costs and fire people via I- Chat. The second is Alex ( Vera Farmiga) a woman Ryan meets in a hotel lounge. In one of my favorite scenes the two flirt in the language of two people who spend too much time on the road. In some very witty dialogue they turn frequent flyer mile perks into near sexual fetish and share war stories about joining the mile high club. Alex tells Ryan very early on to think of her as 'him but with a vagina' and by the end of the movie, trust me, you will believe her. I guess I gave my opinion away to early but I did really enjoy this movie from beginning to end.One warning though, be very afraid if you are ever called into an office at work and sit down in front of a computer to see a smiling, oh so sincere, 'Clooney'esque face looking back.",9,0,2,13 March 2010
