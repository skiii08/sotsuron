The Lobster," A totally fresh and original film
","Tired of seeing the same old boring drivel over and over again? Want to watch something new and original? Check out The Lobster. You will not be disappointed. This film feels totally fresh. It takes place in a world that looks similar to our own but which we soon discover is vastly different than anything any of us may have experienced. It's more like a strange dream or a nightmare, and every minute of it is full of fun.The story—which deals with a divorced man who is staying at a hotel where single people hope to meet a significant other or else be turned into an animal of their choosing—is totally unpredictable and leaves us on the edge of our seat in nervous anticipation. Then, halfway through, just when we think we know what's going to happen next, it takes a huge turn and we're off on the next leg of our adventure. Then it takes another turn and then another. It builds in excitement and intensity—and insanity—right up until the end, and before we know it the two hours have gone by in what feels like half the time. And the ending is amazing. I didn't even see it coming until thirty seconds beforehand and I couldn't help but smile as it unfolded.The characters and the story are bizarre and unreal, nothing like real life, but that's what is so good about it. Even their speech patterns are strange, which makes the voice-over narration all the more enjoyable and ridiculous. At first it feels like bad acting but then we get used to it and then we start to love it. But it's not by any means dumb comedy. On the contrary, it's very smart and deliberate in what it does. And this film has a spectacular sense of humor that is all its own and which stems from these bizarre and unique characters.At one point, the character played by John C. Reilly in perhaps his finest role, stares in bewilderment at man who asks him if he's ever danced before. After several awkward seconds, Reilly replies, quite matter-of-factly and with a lisp, 'Yes,' only to then be asked what kind of dancing he did. Frustrated and still confused, Reilly sighs and responds: 'It depends on the music.' It's hilarious because it's exactly what the character should say but not what we would ever expect him to say. And the film is full of wonderful moments such as this, all dry and all hilarious.The writing and acting are exceptional and unlike anything I've ever seen before. It's been said that there are only seven or eight stories, each being told over and over again in different ways. But The Lobster seems to defy that statement. I can't think of any other movie or story to compare this to. This is truly a one-of-a-kind film and I feel it will develop a huge lasting legacy.",8,0,2,12 January 2017
Come and See," It might ruin other movies for you
","Before watching Come and See, I read somewhere that it was the greatest war film ever made. I thought that this bold claim of greatness surely had to be an exaggeration. It was not. Technically, I supposed I haven't seen every war film, so I can't say that for sure, but it is without a doubt the best war film this boy has ever had the pleasure of watching.This movie is so good because it feels very real. It's gritty and raw, and for those reasons it's a really great experience. There is none of the sappy sentimentality or symbolism that seem to be found in so many other films, even in other war films. As a matter of fact, after watching Come and See, I was forced to reevaluate many of my other favorite films that I had always thought did a good job of portraying realism on the screen. It was only upon seeing this film that I realized that, in comparison, none of the others had gotten it right. Come and See shows the chaos and misery of war in a straightforward, unadulterated manner, leaving its viewers to take from it what they will. Still, the images on the screen are so haunting and powerful that there is likely only one conclusion anyone can draw.From the very first scene, everything feels very real. The actors used weren't professionals. They're not beautiful people; they're ugly and they're dirty and they're real, with crooked eyes and bald spots and missing teeth. They might be real farmers and soldiers and partisans, for all we can tell.In one memorable scene, the lead character and his albino girlfriend make their way through a muddy bog. They sink deeper and deeper, get mud in their hair, and struggle to keep their heads above the surface. At one point I felt sure they were not going to make it. It's a very tense scene. I held my breath and waited for the camera to pan away or cut to a different angle. It did not. It stayed on them for what felt like several minutes. It was agonizing for the viewer, just as it was for the characters and must have been for the actors as well. But the agony was a good thing, because the pure intensity of it all made the experience so much better. It wasn't fake, the way we know it is in most other movies. It was so real that I could almost smell it. It couldn't have been safe for the actors, but that made the viewing experience so much more genuine.Similarly, in the battle scenes, we can tell that the conditions were unsafe and the actors were surely at risk. Real explosions send entire tree trunks flying right past the actors' heads. The characters flee the chaos, and the ground where they'd been standing seconds earlier explodes. Real bullets fly over their heads. We see real fear in their eyes.There's an effect used in the film in which several nearby explosions mess with the main character's hearing. The background sounds are muted and all we hear is an annoying, high-pitched ringing sound. This is similar to the effect used famously in Saving Private Ryan—which I believe borrowed it from this film—and countless others since then. Unlike in Saving Private Ryan, however, the ringing here is actually extremely disconcerting and agonizing. We want it to stop, just like the character must want it to stop. It's disorienting. It feels real. It's not polished and toned down to make for a better cinematic experience. It's loud and obnoxious, just as it should be, and that's what makes for a better experience.The movie started out so strong and powerful that I kept waiting for it to fall on its face and get worse. I felt it couldn't sustain the momentum, but I was proved wrong when it just kept getting better and more intriguing, scene after scene, right up until the climax.The story, while straightforward, feels a bit confusing at first, because it's not what we're used to. It does away with the symbolism and metaphors that are so prevalent in many films. That's not to say that there's not a clear message here; there is. And yes, certain things may be symbols—the way things are naturally in real life—but there is no symbolism forced upon us. The main character's transformation may come to represent the transformation of his people or the rain-drenched stork my represent whatever and blah blah blah, but not because the filmmakers chose to squeeze that into the story, but because that's what happened in the natural course of things, in the story just as easily as it may have in real life.When the film was being made, the filmmakers predicted it would be a difficult film for people to watch. They knew there was a chance that no one would want to see it. It wasn't meant to be enjoyable. But it was extremely enjoyable, at least for me. The story isn't wrapped up neatly and doesn't give the characters any poetic justice; by attempting to tell a real story, the filmmakers opened up so many more possibilities and made a film that is completely honest and unpredictable. The main character goes from one chaotic battlefield to the next, never knowing what will happen. Likewise, the viewers never know what's coming and that makes the movie extremely fun and exciting to watch.Come and See is not a perfect film, however. The acting is bad in spots, especially toward the beginning, and some of the makeup is shoddy. The final scene is a bit unconvincing and does perhaps try too hard to drive the film's message home. Despite these flaws, however, Come and See still does a much better job than almost every other film. It's a unique and wonderful experience and I wish there were more like it.",10,5,6,29 August 2016
The Waterboy," Forrest Gump meets Gilbert Grape
","The Waterboy is a dumb comedy that plays like a cross between Forrest Gump and What's Eating Gilbert Grape, seasoned with Adam Sandler's inimitable silliness. Like Forrest Gump, it's about a 'slow' southern man whose athletic potential is one day noticed by a college football coach who goes on to recruit him for the team. Like Gilbert Grape, it's about a young man who is trapped in his family home taking care of his overweight mother, played here by the lovely and iconic Kathy Bates.The plot for The Waterboy is decidedly silly, and that's by design. But it's no sillier than a typical Hollywood film; the only difference here is that the filmmakers were aware of the absurdity, and that's what is good about it. Everybody's in on the joke. It's about a young man, played by Adam Sandler, who is a dedicated waterboy, serving the players of a college football team for years and without any thanks. He endures much torment from the team members and coach, who constantly ridicule him, and one day he is fired. The coach for the opposing team—played by Henry Winkler in his finest and most hilarious role—recruits him first as a waterboy and then as a linebacker, despite his mother's wishes.He has an extraordinary ability to tackle opponents, due to the anger that has built up within him from years of verbal abuse. But he can only tackle them if he is mad at them, so he imagines the faces of his tormentors on the players of the opposing team. At first he imagines the evil head coach of the team who fired him, then later the players who bullied him, and eventually his own overbearing mother.Like most of Sandler's comedies, the story is of course stitched together with tons of jokes, which are sometimes corny, sometimes hilarious, always ridiculous, and very often extremely quotable. This is perhaps the most quotable of Adam Sandler's films, and for that reason it is one of the most memorable. I watched it once or twice the year it came out and never saw it again until eighteen and a half years later, but I still remembered so many of the lines.My favorite is when the waterboy's coach tells him, right before a play, 'Water sucks. Gatorade is better.' He tells him to use the anger that he feels in hearing that statement on the field to tackle opponents. It's a simple line, and seems like a corny joke at first, but it's actually on of cinema's most hilarious lines for so many reasons.It's hilarious because up until then, the waterboy had been using his deep-seated anger to bring out his rage on the field. But then we see him do just as well based on an insult that his own kindhearted coach mutters to him moments before he steps onto the field, despite the fact that the waterboy himself must know he doesn't really mean it, and in an instant comically trivializing all of the waterboy's abuse that had been built up until that point. It's hilarious that someone would be so personally offended by such a claim about water. And it's hilarious because we all know that water doesn't suck, as it's necessary for survival. The levels of humor are so subtle that one could easily miss them, but they're there. It almost makes me wonder if perhaps ever the writers didn't pick up on them.",6,1,1,5 May 2017
