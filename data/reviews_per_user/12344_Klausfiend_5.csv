Kill Bill: Vol. 2," What, are you high?
","Maudlin. Derivative. A bunch of really bad continuity errors (watch Uma's sword in the scene where she meets her daughter - it's there, it's not, it's back, it's gone - PUHLEEZE - I paid $15 to see rookie editing mistakes? WTF?!).Tarantino could have saved us all an hour and a half and just left the important parts in Vol. 1. The only redeeming segment was the Cruel Tutelage of Pai Mai - and only as an encomium to all the great kung fu films of days gone by. The rest of the movie is a bad soap opera with guns.Comparing it to the legendary Seven Samurai is bordering on sacrilege; it's nothing special, and people really need to realize that the esteemed director has not had an original idea since Pulp Fiction - the sooner, the better.Disappointing.",Null,0,1,16 April 2004
Minority Report," Had me up to the cliche ending ...
","Can some brave director somewhere PLEASE make a film where the hero doesn't get the girl and everyone lives happily ever after? Things like this do not happen in the dystopian future worlds conjured up by a film like Minority Report.Had Spielberg dropped the lame, tacky, redundant, happy, sappy, Hollywood ending, I would have given this film a 9. With the final 20 minutes, my approval gradually ebbed, and on the whole I'd have to give the film a 5 or a 6 - which is a shame. The effects are spectacular, the story is well-told and tightly written, the acting is excellent (even if I hate Tom Cruise for being everybody's favourite all-American) ... it's just the LAME LAME LAME LAME ending that puts the fix in on this film.A good sci-fi film (like Blade Runner) should leave the viewer pondering what happens next - you don't need to be drawn directly to the happy ending - because it's just one of the possibilities. Spielberg gets caught up trying to keep the audience happy instead of keeping them intrigued - a more seasoned sci-fi hand like Ridley Scott would have handled the ending of Minority Report with more savvy.Not bad, but the ending made an excellent film into something merely average.",Null,0,0,25 June 2002
Spider-Man," Hey fanboy, get a room!
","... and make sure all your friends are there. This movie rocks!All my hard work as a kid faithfully watching the Spider-man cartoon on Saturday mornings is finally rewarded.Willem Dafoe is a really creepy (although he was in Wild at Heart, so I think he's had a lot of practice) Norman Osborne.It's the kind of movie every movie based on a comic book should aspire to be. Evil villains, honest heroes who resemble real people, and the well-drawn lines that make comic books the refuge of a bookish youth with a vivid imagination.Some of the effects are a little spotty, but nobody's perfect. ... now if only someone would make a decent live action Batman movie, I'd be happy.",8,0,0,7 May 2002
Batman Begins," Pretty decent. Worth waiting for.
","Dark dark dark! Christopher Nolan understands there's a reason he's called 'the Dark Knight'! Most of the other reviews have said pretty much all that needs saying, although from the negative ones I read through it seems to me they didn't really 'get' the character. Batman is like Mephisto from Faust, out of the shadows, come from Hell, to avenge the innocent, and settle accounts with the guilty ... that is what makes him so scary, and that is why this movie succeeds - he is a frightening thing, and until now, he's only ever been portrayed like a carnival attraction, with no real menace to him. Nolan depicts it beautifully ... but what the hell was that 9/11 review about, though? I will say the fight sequences could have been more interesting, visually, but I think we can let that one slide ... the suit weighs a ton, the scenes were dark, and you can only learn so much hand-to-hand combat in six months. The Batman that fans know has a lot more practice.Good to see a live action Batman that was worth watching!",9,6,9,15 June 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Good, but not great.
","Unlike the last Tolkien film Jackson made, on this one, he doesn't adhere to the 'show, don't tell' principle, and there are numerous (and rather annoying) ad-libs and editions to the plot. Without attempting to sound too much like a Tolkien fanatic, I have to take issue with a few parts (which, while not disturbing the main plot threads, nevertheless change the tone of the overall story) ... so, if you haven't seen it, stop reading this now:Okay, people who haven't yet seen it looking away? Hey, a few of you are cheating - so look away already ...<ul><li>The trip to Helm's Deep, after the evacuation of Rohan - there was no battle. It seemed less like an interesting plot addition and more of a ham-fisted attempt to make the show more exciting (which is, quite honestly, unnecessary - the story is already pretty damned interesting).</li></ul><ul><li>The changes in characterization of Sam and Frodo were also rather unnecessary. Sam and Frodo both understand Gollum's true nature, and while tolerating him - neither trusts him - and the film fails to reflect their accurate understanding of the broken and unredeemed character that Gollum is, in pursuit of some mealy 'everyone can be redeemed' moralizing. Get over it. Some are evil by design, some by accident, Gollum happens to be one destroyed by his own moral weakness - and the film fails to accurately convey that. Frodo is also not so much seduced by the power of the ring, but more driven to despair - he is pure in spirit, but the nature of the ring begins to corrupt and destroy the hope that he brings with him - the very hope that will see him through the bitter end. His apparent willingness to surrender the ring to the Nazgul at Osgilliath (who thought that one up, anyway?) is completely bogus, and does not properly reflect Frodo's true nature - the humble servant, charged with an almost impossible task, but willingly accepting of his duty, and willing to see it done, despite what it may cost him.</li></ul><ul><li>As for Faramir - again, the screenplay fails to accurately convey that he is quite different from his brother; his brother was ambitious and proud. Faramir is humble and honourable - he knows what must be done, and is not arrogant like his brother, who assumed that the power of the ring could be turned against its master - a mistake which cost him his life. Tolkien generally does not allow his characters a morally ambiguous fate, and by portraying Faramir as cut of the same cloth as his brother, it opens the possibility for him to be similarly corrupted by the same thing, and eventually to suffer the same fate. This is quite simply not true, and to do so would ruin one of the finest of Tolkien's characters, and distort the story.</li></ul><ul><li>The Ents, too, are never unsure of what must be done; they understand their fate, should they fail to act, and they recognize that they, too, must struggle against evil, even to a bitter end. The cheesy pseudo-green moralizing is an irritating distraction.</li></ul><ul><li>The sappy love triangle between Eowyn and Aragon is pointless, and smacks of the kind of phony romanticism that has made Hollywood famous.</li></ul>However, I will say that those complaints notwithstanding, the film still manages to come together quite spectacularly - especially the battle of Helm's Deep (the appearance of the Elves aside). Jackson manages to portray very well the almost insurmountable odds the people of Rohan face, and their courage and indomitability even in the face of certain death.So ... on the whole, a decent job - but not as good a depiction as the first installment. I sincerely hope that the screenwriters don't take further liberties, and create an ambiguous mish-mash of cloying sentimentality and cheap aphorisms for the sake of a bigger audience. I think it rather presumptuous for screenwriters to assume that they can tell a better story than one of the best.",Null,0,0,14 January 2003
