The Perks of Being a Wallflower," 3 reasons
","Emotional, well thought, and revolutionary are three words that describe the film based off the acclaimed novel by Stephen Chewbosky. The movie The Perks of Being A Wallflower is the most true based, realistic movie of this generation. Not only will this movie bring you to the edge of your seat, but it will also make you feel a personal connection to the characters. Specifically, I think the perks of being a wallflower is worth the time and money to see is because of my own personal connection to Charlie (played by Logan Lerman). Throughout the story, Charlie deals with many hardships with his family, and newly found friends. For example, Charlies aunt was killed in a car accident on the way to buy his birthday present when he was a young boy. Throughout my own life, I have already dealt with situations that are unforgettable, such as my aunt getting cancer. Also, in the 8th grade, Charlie's good friend committed suicide. This affected Charlies personality deeply, and the way he acted around his peers.In the 7th grade, my friend was killed by bone marrow cancer, and the impact it had on me affected me as it did Charlie. The character of Sam (Emma Watson) also connected to my own life. Sam was on of the two seniors, the other being Patrick, who befriend Charlie when they meet at the homecoming football game? As soon as Charlie sees Sam, he falls in love with her. Sam believed that love never truly worked out for anyone, as did I. After breaking up with her boyfriend, Sam presents Charlie with a truly puzzling question. 'Why does I, and everyone, love the people who treat us like we're nothing?' And Charlie answers 'we accept the love we think we deserve.' If we think low of ourselves, we are going to accept people who use us and don't love is for who we really are, but if we love ourselves, we can love others and treat them with higher regard. In addition, the realism throughout the film is what contributes to the beauty of the storyline. The way that Charlie deals with everything he sees is very realistic. Some people, When they see things occurring, they don't know what to do, so they just stand by and observe. That's what Charlie had been doing for some while since his friend died. Then, when he found people who let him in, he began to open up. At a party Patrick gives a toast to Charlie. In it he states, 'He's a wallflower. You see things. You keep quiet about them. And you understand.' It is in this moment that Charlie feels noticed, and completely happy for having friends. This movie also shows the real importance it is to have friends. Before Patrick and Sam, Charlies door was closed, and he refuses to let anyone in. Then, when he gained them as friends, he began to open up to the world, and he enjoyed it. Additionally, this film shows the realisticness of how people judge each other. Charlie's group of friends is judged for being freaks because they are not popular. Charlie is also labeled as a freak because he does not participate in activities. Nevertheless, people may oppose to see this movie. It is rated Pg-13, and many parents feel that they do not want their child to be exposed to the subjects the film discusses. I think that the film is appropriate for kids over 13, as it was rated. The film discusses things like death, personal relationships, teenagers being gay, and even rape. Although this film includes these topics, I think the film is worth seeing for teens. If parents try to hide their son or daughter from these things that occur everyday, they won't be prepared for real life on their own. Moreover, this story is recognized for its great script. The literature Charlie's uses as he writes portrays exactly how he feels as he writes. As Charlie was discussing his earlier trip to go sleeping he writes 'And I thought that all those little kids are going to grow up someday. And all of those little kids are going to do the things that we do. And they will all kiss someone someday. But for now, sledding is enough. I think it would be great if sledding were always enough, but it isn't.' This excerpt shows the literature and choice of writing the author uses. The film is also portrayed almost exact from the novel. I think that is part of the reason why this film did very well. The film was directed by Stephen Chewbosky, who also wrote the novel. Not only will this movie change the way you view life, but it will change the way you treat your own friends and family. Also, the people around you. You never know anyone story until they tell you, and you can't judge them until you walk a mile in their shoes. We could all use our own thoughts as an excuse to not participate, but we should choose not to. 'Because things change. Friends leave. And life doesn't stop for anybody.' We should be happy, and appreciate what we have and live for the moments that make us feel alive. As Charlie states in his own moment of pure happiness ' in that moment, I swear we were infinite.'",10,4,8,9 November 2012
