Iron Man 3," How is this movie not listed as a comedy?
","We start the movie with 'blue' song which maybe done to give us a clue as where this movie stands however, the subject gets too serious too quickly, with the bombings, the people vaporizing... It gets really hard to find a joke in it. then as we learn how these bombings happen, we don't believe it, it can not happen in the real world. The odd thing is the movie realizes this in the second half of the movie and mocks it self. it turns into a full on comedy mode. it is really hard to find any seriousness any darkness in the story line. I appreciate that Shane Black mocks the formula every other movie uses(which is dark knight formula) what I don't appreciate that he does this through iron man franchise. If you are hard core fan of Robert D. Jr. you should go and see this movie. Otherwise I suggest you wait for the DVD, or just watch it for the laughs.",5,3,6,3 May 2013
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," disappointing
","after watching this movie, you can easily say that, the story about logan's past better stayed untold. through out the movie you can feel that both the screen play writers and the director struggle to handle the story. characters are one dimensional, the relationship between the characters are unclear and non motivated which made some actions done by the cast seems unnecessary or unrealistic. all the other things a side, i was still waiting for an action filled ending which i thought can't go wrong however even though some scenes were impressive and brother bonding was fun to watch, the last scene was so weak that makes you want to forget it right away. i have to say that, Stryker, risking his life to erase logan's memory was one of the weakest ending to an any comic adaptation.i think they will make a sequel for wolverine and i hope they try to keep it more simple, if they had just focused on wolverine and sabertooth's rivalry it would be more intense, memorable and realistic. that doesn't mean i don't want to see the other characters too, but in a movie about wolverine they don't need the x-men style of story telling..",2,20,46,22 April 2009
21," howard professor
","first i must say that, if i was a Howard professor, who is been told this story, i'ld definitely be impressed. It's not so often that you hear a story this original and interesting. However as a movie it is way far off from being interesting, one dimensional characters, not so good acting from the actors(even not from spacey whom i worship), music filled 'romantic' moments, and the 'surprise' ending was so obvious that it was boring to wait for it to happen. so in my opinion, this movie is made to cash in obviously, no passion put into this as far as i can see. We can easily say that this movie is a conventional remake of a different high school themed movie.(and it is hearth breaking to know how much better it could be..)",4,0,1,7 February 2009
Jack Reacher," Batman in casual wear
","the movie starts as high budget law and order episode(which I actually liked), than turns into an action movie(which I also liked). however, because we don't get the villains motivations, other than they want to build a bridge so they have to have a guy with two fingers, one eye and a German accent, we are actually certain that reacher will prevail, because the villains don't have any kind of plan or purpose other than waiting for reacher to kill them. it is as obvious as what happens in the last scene of the movie which makes me think in a way that 'if you don't show what happens next on the last scene because we can clearly guess what happens, why show if jack reacher will prevail against werner herzog's character?'all this said, I enjoyed the movie, it's not great but fun to watch if you don't expect much from it..",5,1,4,3 May 2013
The Great Gatsby," We've seen greater Gatsby's
","First of all I think Luhrman did a good job until the end of the movie. However I do agree that this story is worn out. We've seen greater Gatsby's, we've seen greater love stories, I don't think the book it's relevance that it had back when its written. So to expect more from a production is, if I've to quote the movie, 'asking too much'. My only criticisms are the ending and CGI's of the movie. CGI'S are too obvious that they are not real, we don't believe them to be real for a second. As far as the ending, Luhrman should've think a better way to end the movie, it seemed like he just gave up. That maybe the biggest reason that this movie gets this many negative feedback.",6,0,2,17 May 2013
