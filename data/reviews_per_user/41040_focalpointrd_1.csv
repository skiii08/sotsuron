10 Cloverfield Lane," This movie is complete garbage
","May contain spoilers so read at your own risk.Pretty much the WORST potential sequel to an unpredictable monster/destruction/action movie ever. Firstly, this lacks nearly all of those characteristics. Second, when did we find out that this was an alien attack in the first movie? It's almost expected of us to know this as we're waist deep into the second movie before we even discuss what could be outside the bunker. Oh, yeah... right... the bunker, the one we're forced to see from nearly every angle possible because 95% of the movie takes place in it. I feel like I know more about the bunker than I do about the surrounding area, location, and what is happening outside. Completely horrible. I expected MAYBE half of the movie to take place in the bunker, but no... 1hr 20mins into a 90~ min movie, and we're still in there, without having seen one monster aside from John Goodman's angrier side when he realizes Winstead's not going to play the role of his lover/daughter, or whatever. This is literally a movie about a crazed man who has the perfect excuse to kidnap this girl who he 'bumps' into on the road during the unfolding events of what I assume is the first movie, but we'd never know because we're never told that! Do yourself a favor, and wait for this to hit red box for a dollar rental... or just skip it entirely and watch re-runs of Real World/Road Rules challenge. The scripted drama is far better in those shows than in this. Winstead should have done another Scott Pilgrim film instead of doing this, and the budget they probably spent on making this movie was likely minimal.",1,91,180,25 March 2016
