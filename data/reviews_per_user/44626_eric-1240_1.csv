Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What happened?
","Growing up Star Wars was my life. Empire Strikes back was also very good in the day, though overrated by its cult following. Then came return of the Jedi, a bad movie, but at least it brought closure to the saga. A generation later we got the prequels, and the little kid in me got excited. Lucas was coming back to Star Wars. Man I wish he hadn't, as these new installments just didn't have it. Lucas has directed, produced and/or created some great films: Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Empire Strikes Back, but he has also produced some real lemons: Howard the Duck, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Unfortunately, The Phantom Menace fits comfortably in this later category. Further it opened the door for all kinds of ridicules alterations in the original Star Wars and its sequels. What a shame to watch a man of Lucas's talent lose it.",1,4,8,15 November 2006
