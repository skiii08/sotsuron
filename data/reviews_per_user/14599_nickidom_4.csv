The New World," History Reveiw
",Im watching this movie because it was required. and its a pretty good movie. the plot is just explaining (inaccurately) what happened with john smith and Pocahontas. this movie is also explaining how we got to america and how European organized civilization. and how Pocahontas got back to Europe. Pocahontas was actually 10 in when she met john smith. in the movie she was around 14 or 15. and it kinda showed that john smith and her had a relationship. Pocahontas from Disney has a connection. they are about the same type thing. just explained differently. John smith was way cooler than john rolph. i liked when they traded the princess for a kettle. the part where the naturals were like moneys was pretty cool too. i didnt like john rolph. the movie was pretty good. id watch it again. it was interesting for sure. the director was really good at setting up this movie. and i like the movie batman so i guess thats a automatic yes.,6,0,0,30 August 2018
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Reeeeeeeeeeview
","We watched this movie for our history through film class. this movie was about 2 bandits that were being hunted by the strong arm of the law. so they moved to bolivia and ended up robbing more banks there. when they realuzed their be hunted there they tried to go straight but that didnt work so they died fighting. it was good filming. they say they didnt find butches body in real life. so id imagine that in the movie that body looks like swiss cheese on the ground. bandits like in the book off life. i liked when the guy made the girl take off her clothes with a gun, when the sundance kid shot things was cool too. and last but most certainly not least i liked when they died. i didnt like that they died. love hate relationship with death. it was a cool movie and id watch it again if i was forced to like that girl was with the clothes.",10,2,3,23 October 2018
The Alamo," Review
",This movie is about how the US got Texas as its 28th state. and it tells the story of the Alamo. we are watching this movie for school. this is a newer movie and it looked really good. all the costumes where more old timey and the hair and hats were spot on. nobody really knows how crocket died so i mean thats technically not acurate. i liked the movie in all and i didnt like the mean guy that killed crocket. this movie was great.,8,0,2,5 October 2018
Cinderella Man," review
","This movie was really good, i would watch it again. it is about a guy trying to support his family and the only way to do that is to fight. i liked the part where his homie kept him standing up and the competitor got really confused and i also liked the part when he fought the last guy. i didnt like it when max was being a douche to him in the ring. it was agood movie.",10,1,1,4 December 2018
