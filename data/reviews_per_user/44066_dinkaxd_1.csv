Catch Me If You Can," A wonderful storyline & the cast
","Catch me if you can is the best example of how a great film should be made. The famous director, Steven Spielberg worked hard to do this film unpredictable and to create very interesting plot twists. The film centres on a big lie. We can see a 19 years old boy, Frank Abagnale, his father, the other Frank Abagnale and the FBI agent Carl Hanratty. The story centres on the counterfeiting checks by Frank Abagnale Jr. and on the persecution of Frank with the FBI, and especially Carl Hanratty.The film begins as Frank parents get divorced. From his father, Frank gets his first 25$ in his checking account. He starts to fake checks because his main goal is to get his parents back together and return his father's money. The film reaches a turning point when police starts to chase him. As the story progresses he begins to change the way he fakes money and becomes a doctor to hide from the FBI agent Carl Hanratty. But the police find his number and Carl phones him. Between them there is an interesting conversation and soon after that Frank was caught by the FBI.For many people this film became one of the favorites and I know why. The plot is amazing and completely unpredictable. The actors are famous and they were selected professionally. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks perfectly played their characters. The film definitely succeeded, we can see that because this film has now become a classic. I can't see any bad things about this film. Maybe there were a few special effects, but I think drama and crime films don't need that many special effects.Whatever you like or dislike crime films, you will enjoy this one because of it's storyline. I would recommend this film to anyone who like strong films where there are many great moments where you feel suspense. And I would recommend this film to girls who like Leonardo DiCaprio (he is so young and beautiful in this film).",9,0,1,3 February 2018
