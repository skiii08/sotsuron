Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Force is Strong With This One!
","I have to argue with the critics on this and say that this film was absolutely amazing. I honestly couldn't have expected more from a Star Wars movie.The first thing that hits you about this movie are the special effects. The droids and especially the Gungan army look amazing, you really can't tell there fully computer generated.The characters are all well written, well acted and likeable, even Jar Jar. The only Character that annoyed me was the commentator at the podrace. I thought he was about a hundred times more annoying than Jar Jar ever was. I think Darth Maul's presence on screen was kept to a good time, You don't really him to over shadow the presence of Darth Vader on the first trilogy. I felt Annakin was a little to young for the part, but you get used to it.The music, as always, was great. From the main title theme to the Duel of the Fates, you couldn't help but get a feel for the atmosphere in the star wars universe.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and can't wait for the next ones.",6,0,1,7 August 2000
Mission: Impossible II," Dissapointing!!!!!
","I went in to this movie expecting something great but left feeling kinda empty. For a John Woo movie there was a definite lack of action sequnces and the action sequences that were used were nothing spectacular. The acting was poor, the characters were so 1 dimensional it was unbelievable and the story was nothing original. I liked the first M:I film, it wasn't great but compared to this it was a masterpiece. This is if nothing else straight to video material, even John Woo's Blackjack was a better movie by far and it DID go straight to video!!! Overall this was a BAD film. I still can't belive I actually wasted my time seeing this, I couldv'e done something more interesting with my time like watching paint dry or the grass growing.",1,1,2,24 September 2000
