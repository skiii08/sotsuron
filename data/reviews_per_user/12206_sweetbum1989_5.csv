The Hangover," I've never laughed so much in my life!
","I went to go see this film about a week ago not long after it released here in the UK and I have to admit I was expecting the usual comedy where the best parts are in the trailer! That was not the case:The Hangover has got to be one of the funniest, well written and comically genius movies of all time!! It will have you laughing from beginning to end and if you don't go see this you are definitely missing out!! Everything that you want in a comedy you will get with this movie and then some! I'm a big fan of eighties comedy when everything was new and unseen so i rarely find todays comedies as funny but this film has made it to the top of the list in my eyes and i will be very surprised if anyone doesn't love this movie as much as i do! it will definitely be making it into my DVD collection and i may do something i hardly do...i might go see it again at the cinemas!Amazing! Brilliant! Just when you think you've seen it all in comedy 'The Hangover' blows everything out of the water!",10,5,8,21 June 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," The one of middle ground
","Jack Sparrows back and looking as mad as ever but for some reason i still think that Johnny Depp looks yummy...Will Turner is also back and looks better than ever...yum to that too. The story pretty much picks up where it left off...Will and Miss Swann (Knightly) are still loved up and are about to get hitched when the new Idiot in a wig sabotages the entire affair by arresting them...their only hope lies with captain Jack Sparrow who, not surprisingly, has got got into a spot of bother himself...Will Turner's father makes a little comeback, neither is he dead or alive, to tell Jack that its time for wriggly beard man Davy Jones to collect what he's owed: Jacks soul. Will Turner races across the oceans trying to find Jack so he can free Miss Swann...Jack then tricks young Will into becoming captive by Davy Jones, where Will meets his Father;such a touching moment...as this is happening our own Lizzy (swann) has gotten free and caught up with Jack and the black pearl with the help of a certain dress and very stupid crew members...Jack manages to trick her also into helping him whilst it seems that miss Swann has become attracted to him...(was hating her at this point!!) With various different story lines going on and the fact that the characters hardly stay together for long...the second edition to the pirate trilogy sets us up for what I'm sure will be a fantastic 3rd finale movie. This movie is definitely the middle rest point of the trilogy as it seems to fill in gaps from the first movie whilst making new gaps to be filled by the 3rd. The movie is not short of action...romance...comedy and big monstrous creature things. All in all not a bad sequel...it has just made me more anxious for the next one. Note to reader: please make sure that members of your party who are going to watch this movie have already seen the first otherwise they will just be confused.",8,1,3,13 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," pay attention or you'll lose yourself
","All those that go and see this film will not be disappointed; the storyline is full of twists and turns that would make a roller-coaster dizzy, the characters are well thought out and played to a tee and the special effects are exciting enough to stop a girl going to the ladies (well i didn't want to miss anything did i?!). However when watching the movie keep your wits about you as it is not an easy ride, with so many different plots and sub-plots it is easy to lose your head. Some said that the storyline would be predictable; it is far from it, they said it wouldn't be as good as the previous ones; they were wrong. if anything this movie only highlights why the previous films were such big successes. Finally there are only two more points i would like to make: 1. those who are hardcore romantics, try not to be too disappointed in the end 2. and those who like me wished that Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp would wear less clothes in the movie then I'm afraid more disappointment is in order....lolEnjoy people.....",9,1,3,31 May 2007
She's the Man," what a laugh! a great movie to watch and cheer u up after a hard day!
","Shes the man is great. its funny, original and made me laugh so much i nearly wet my seat. the day i went to go see it at the movies i wasn't in the best of moods (man trouble)but leaving the movie i had a grin plastered on my face. The story is a bit out there with the whole no-one noticing that she looks way too much like a girl but hey who am i to say whats believable, the jokes are great and some of the one liners in this 2006 hit could go down in history. Amanda B. did a great job as the main role and Channing Tatum looks too good to be true as her opposite as the gorgeous Duke. So girls go see this because its a great laugh and there's a hot guy in it and boys u go see it because you might just learn something about girls! All in all a brilliant,fantastic and fun movie which i will be buying on DVD when it comes out.",9,3,4,21 April 2006
Stardust," shining bright in my eyes
","If your in need of some comedy, adventure, romance, fantasy or anything else you can find in a film then you should go see Stardust. This Star-studded fantasy adventure will have you smiling from start to finish. the start is a tad slow and nowt really happens until about 20 mins in but once it gets going the action is aplenty. By far the best character is Robert De Niro's Captain Shakespeare. He is soo funny that i was branded a geek and a loser for laughing so much! hehe. Id recommend this to anyone for a good nights entertainment. it has laughs and romance aplenty and although not the best movie in the world it provides the entertainment throughout.",8,6,8,25 October 2007
