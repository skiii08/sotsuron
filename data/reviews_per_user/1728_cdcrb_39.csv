First Man," man walks on moon.
","As a baby boomer this film probably affected me more than some. the title tells the story, but I was just reminded of the sacrifices and guts it took. for what purpose I don't know, but it's quite a story. ryan is great, as per usual.",8,0,1,16 October 2018
The Finest Hours," better than you'd expect
","based on the trailer, I wasn't expecting anything different from other similar films. the very slow start hangs on a mushy romance and I'm thinking what about the boat broken in half. but hang on. we do get to it. the surprise is that there are two stories, both exciting and heroic. the scenes and action on the disabled ship are very real and seem quite dangerous. while the chris pine piloted boat goes on an adventure of its own. Affleck is very good in his role as an anti hero and pine does what he can. handsome young men have to get into their 40's before talent rears it's head. I did not choose 3d. I don't care for the glasses-I don't think I missed much. I have seen a lot worse movies. really, give it a chance.",7,6,13,30 January 2016
Deepwater Horizon," good job
","what might seem like a throw back to the big disaster movies from the 70's, is instead a thought provoking serious study about what happens when the almighty bottom line comes before everything else. and unlike those 70's movies, there are no back stories here, just the meat and potatoes of what went wrong on the bp rig in the gulf of Mexico and the tragedy that follows. because the job is falling behind schedule and bp is losing money every day, corners are cut and when the tests of the integrity of the drilling fail all hell breaks loose. why many more people weren't killed is a miracle. as usual mark whalburg is very good and kurt Russell is fine, also. this is a very sturdy effort by peter berg. he's very good with technical details and respectful of the men and women who risk their lives to provide us with the oil we so desperately seem to need. I am not being political, here. we are just very dependent on it.",8,0,1,1 October 2016
It," very familiar territory
","this movie is for you if you have never seen a horror movie or read a Stephen king novel. it's actually Stephen king's 'stand by me', only with an evil clown. but, get this. the evil clown isn't only a clown. it can turn into anything at any time. so basically you have a group of misfit boys and a young girl thrown together to fight evil, in whatever shape it takes. at one point, one of the kids says that the town has a missing child rate six times the national average. what ever that is. with that in mind, one wonders why the police don't seem to be the least concerned with this statistic. because no one seems alarmed as the disappearances occur. anyway, the weekend breakdown is 65% over the age of 25. so they have definitely seen all this before. whatever. peace.",5,13,24,9 September 2017
Hereditary," save your money
",I couldn't figure out why toni collete and Gabriel byrne were in this turkey until I saw the executive director credits. trust me. this is an august movie. dump month.,1,11,29,11 June 2018
Rocketman," no blast off
","Taron Egerton is Dwight/Elton. no problem with that. the thing is we all know the story. it's all been reported in the press over the last 50 years. a lot. there are no surprises, and it's not really a performance film. the songs are telling the story. so they don't stand out. it's not a terrible movie. it's just by the numbers moviemaking.",6,3,5,3 July 2019
Wind River," murder mystery on the reservation
","Jeremy renner, graham greene, gil Birmingham, the weinsteins. what else do you need? I wish I knew. an august release! everyone knows august is dump month. anyway, we have a murder mystery on an Indian reservation in Wyoming. taylor Sheridan, the writer/director is assuming you already know about the plight of the American Indian in the u. s. so a lot goes unsaid. and unseen. the episode you are dreading is not anywhere nearly as bad to sit through as you are expecting. the movie is well acted by the main characters and the cinematography is beautiful. justice is served, but probably not to everyone's liking.",8,2,6,7 August 2017
Passengers," lost in space
","5 thousand passengers set sail for a 120 year tour. computer failure results in chris pratt coming out of hibernation way early. he gets lonely and decides Jennifer Lawrence would make good company. they fall in love and have sex. I couldn't help but think that this is a mans' fantasy kind of movie. our hero is lonely. so he wakes up the prettiest girl in the pool. how about one of the guys for one on one basketball or fantasy football. too homoerotic for a 120 million dollar production. probably. so go with sexy man and pretty girl. fail safe. add to this a very boring story and you've got your self one bomb. Jennifer Lawrence is the star so she'll get the blame. chris better get back to those dinosaurs-quick. it looks expensive, though. a big disappointment. with Christmas falling on a Sunday and a low per screen average, I don't see $250 million to cover costs. i'd hope to be wrong. it's odd they would release this so soon after 'arrival.' p.s. the movie was a hit after all, especially overseas. I still stick by my review. the film got a 31 on rotten tomatoes and 41 from metacritic.",5,6,15,27 December 2016
Us," not much here
","Spoilers. In all the reviews I've looked at, no one mentions the violence. there's lots of it. and blood. this is basically a movie about home invasion and the aftermath. when the twist comes, you really knew it all along. and it still doesn't work. as Pauline kael said about the exorcist, 'it would be pure insanity to take children'.",1,6,9,28 March 2019
Knives Out," by the numbers.
","The trailer is a lot more fun than the movie. it's like 'murder on the orient express'. if you liked that, you'll like this. chris evans might have a career after super hero life. he's pretty good here.",6,8,14,4 December 2019
Aquaman," water, water everywhere..........................
","I can't say it's a great movie, but Jason momoa looks the part and he's quite funny as well. there's a little something here for everyone and it's certainly different from most other films. for once I would recommend imax. and if mr. momoa thinks he can go off his diet, he's mistaken. there's definitely
A2 on the horizon.",7,1,3,30 December 2018
Deadpool 2," ryan can you hear me?
","I know sequels are just more of the same, but this is one lame flick. after you say the 'f' word a million times, it loses its sting. and they seem to do everything twice, just in case you didn't get it.",5,4,10,21 May 2018
Doctor Strange," ho hum
","trust me when I tell you this. you have seen all this before, many, many times. a lot of star wars sword fighting, for one. it's all computer generated nonsense, and the star, benedict Cumberbatch is very uncomfortable mouthing his lines. he better run back to television and Sherlock holmes. the other stars, ejiofor, Swinton and mc adams are simply wasted. the story is about a brilliant surgeon who loses the use of his hands and in search of a cure, finds nirvana. but in finding this inner peace, evil,in the form of mads mickkelsen, lurks to destroy the world. I lost count of how many times mads and benedict meet and fight, but it was a lot. this is a movie, where virtually anything can happen at any minute. that's not movie making to me. and yes, I know, i'm in the minority here. but I am not alone.",5,2,4,1 December 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," bitterness and hate rolled into one
","it's unfortunate to use the word comedy, dark or otherwise, with regard to this film. unpleasant would be a better adjective. if you've seen the trailer you know what the billboards are about. if not, you'll know when you see the movie. revenge and guilt are being served up cold. deep down, apparently, every one has a heart of gold. racists, wife beaters. whatever. I did not buy it. others have.",4,139,273,10 November 2017
The Lost City of Z," a trip to nowhere
","it's the early 1900's. Charlie hunnam stars as major Fawcett. his family comes from the wrong side of the tracks, apparently. he is offered a chance to go to Bolivia and determine the disputed boundary between bolivia and brazil. as the director of the London geographical society points out, if fawcett succeeds he will regain his family's good name. this results in Fawcett making several trips to boliva. his final trip is to find the lost city of Z. it's all sort of meaningless, really. i'm sure there is something mystical going on, but I missed it.",6,3,7,18 April 2017
Justice League," good vx. evil. yet again.
","all in all, it's not bad. it's just that you've seen this before. a lot. anyway, superman is dead and so new action figures must be brought into the fold to fight evil. the film looks great, ie. expensive and things move right along. when batman tells Alfred he is getting to old to fight crime, he's right.",Null,0,0,28 November 2017
Split," no sixth sense
","I saw 'split' on sat. morning in nyc. clearly the crowd was there to see the movie, not kill time until later. the place was packed. buzz has been keen. if you saw the trailer, you know the set up. if you didn't, I won't spoil it. anyway james mc avoy is suffering from split personalities: men, women and children. perhaps, more. some of them are in therapy. one of them kidnaps three nublle girls and we wait for bad things to happen. I am such a fan of 'sixth sense', that it's been down hill since then for m. night shyamalan, although I did like 'unbreakable'. I can't say 'split' is all that good, even though reviews have been kind. the movie, as expected goes down several different paths, but really doesn't make sense. I must tell you that the audience applauded at the end. and no one checked their electronic device. not once.",6,1,8,21 January 2017
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," cyborgs
","I saw this movie today. 8/26/17. in 3D. what surprised me most was how up to date it was . even with all the cgi we see in today's films , this really holds up just fine. I was also surprised with linda Hamilton's bad ass character. a huge role for a woman in 1991. also, Edward furlong's first big gig. Arnold, is Arnold. he looked great. you know the story, i'm sure. but if you don't, it's about saving mankind.peace.",Null,1,2,26 August 2017
Dunkirk," ordinary stuff
","did you see the trailer? then you've seen the film. there are no surprises of any kind. trapped soldiers in France are rescued by British ships. there is no acting to speak of. not a lot of gore, either. most of the movie is tom hardy gliding around in a plane, which has run out of fuel. when the soldiers are rescued, the film still has another 20 minutes to go. it's all by the numbers. the reviews have been glowing. I guess I saw a different Dunkirk.",5,16,29,22 July 2017
Yesterday," let it be
","As an actual baby boomer, the beatles were very important to me and I was looking forward to seeing this movie. alas, it's just a movie about a guy who gets famous singing the songs as if they were his own. just like the trailer. it's also a romcom. the 'jokes' fall flat and it's predictable. it just didn't work for me.",5,0,1,2 July 2019
A Quiet Place," stoopid.
","Glowing reviews aside, here's the rub. it's a movie where everyone has to be silent and make no noise or else the demons will 'take you out.' and I don't mean on a date. so to keep the plot moving along people have to make noise. and get this. no one wears shoes. so walking barefoot is bound to result in some kind of mishap. like stepping on a nail, a sharp stone, a piece of glass. you get the picture. the children in the family seem to have a very hard time understanding what not to do. it's an audience pleaser, that's for sure. 100 million+ so far, after 11 days.",1,18,39,17 April 2018
1917," getting to the front
","George mackay deserves some kind of prize, just for surviving this movie. it's 1917, george and a buddy have to deliver a message, before it's too late. lots of 'you are there' action. sam mendes does a great directing job. even if you hate war movies, this one's for you.",8,0,1,10 January 2020
The King," shakespeare, very light.
","Chalamet gets most of the nagative reviews, but the whole cast stinks. edgerton is no shakespeare. henry V and falstaff at agincourt. it's a silly movie, really. and the battle, which critics seem to like, is a muddle. literally.",5,39,79,16 October 2019
Don't Breathe," horror fun
","this is not my usual fare, but I heard good things about it, so I went on a Saturday afternoon and a good time was had by all. basic premise-three morons break into houses to steal stuff and sell same to a fence for peanuts. the fence tells 'money' about a big score for cash and off we go. the hitch is that the house money, rocky and alex break into is owned by a blind man, who turns the tables on them by turning off the lights. he also has a gun. I know, I know. but it worked for me. Stephen lang as the blind man is very intense, and the young woman playing rocky is more of a man than either of her robbing partners. I don't remember a horror movie where the woman is a strong character, at the expense of the men. kudos. go. you'll have a good time.",7,0,3,3 September 2016
The Shape of Water," love conquers all
","creature from the black lagoon meets mute woman. unfortunately, I must join the 10% who did not like this film. I am a big del toro fan, but this left a very unpleasant taste in my mouth. especially in the present climate of sexual harassment, racism and general hate. the acting is wonderful and in this fantasy world there is more than a touch of reality. it may be fine for critics looking to bestow awards, but as a rabid movie goer I don't always need real.",1,65,140,1 December 2017
American Made," boring
","remember Reagan, Iran contra, Madonna. then this flick is for you. based on lies/truth? tom is a flyer who deals in smuggling, cigars, drugs, whatever. he gets in more scrapes that you can shake a stick at and unbelievably smells like a rose. cliché after cliché go on for what seems like a long time. 2 hours. the reviews keep pointing out how charming tom is in this role. if you say so.",4,15,29,29 September 2017
"Hail, Caesar!"," not as bad as you've heard.
","I am sorry to say this, but if you were born after 1964 this movie will not resonate at all. it's full of jokes and innuendos from the 40's and 50's which will fall on deaf ears, unless you are a movie buff. the trailer pretty much sums up everything. george as a gladiator, josh as a movie mogul, scarlett as a vamp. this might be a spoiler, but channing tatum shows up in a show stopping scene. and is very good and a surprise. I'm sure the user reviews will be brutal, but it isn't a terrible film. we are just used to more substantial fare from the the coen bros. there is a serious undertone, but it gets lost here. my advice is to relax and have fun.",6,2,5,12 February 2016
Kong: Skull Island," giant ape and not bad.
","at the end of the movie when kong is pounding his chest (no empire state building here) I thought to myself 'i just saw this ending not that long ago.' I was mistaken. it was not a gorilla, but a dinosaur roaring. pretty much the same though. look for the sequel at your local theatre in the not too distant future. anyway, in this version of king kong, he's the good guy and man is the baddie. Samuel l. Jackson (not as intense as usual, but he is troubled) leads a group of scientists into uncharted territory to look for i'm not sure what. when they start blowing up the island, kong appears, to put a stop to the proceedings, and it's pretty much down hill from there. there is literally nothing here you haven't seen before. many times. it's not terrible, just familiar. no acting to speak of (except for john c. reilly) and major characters get eaten or blown up. whatever. several folks in the crowd checked their electronic devices. often. never a good sign. your call.",6,3,7,11 March 2017
Arrival," not yet.
",Are we alone. who knows? well reviewed. I guess you can pull the wool over reviewers eyes. interesting that amy wasn't nominated for best actress. paramount kept the movie in theaters until it hit the 100mm mark. so it was considered a hit. oh yes. one thing. it's boring.,5,0,3,3 May 2018
Parasite," blood bath
",Spoilers. don't be fooled. this is not a brilliant satire about the 'real' south korea. it's really a horror movie dressed as quality. violence and cruelty abound.,1,44,146,23 October 2019
The Greatest Showman," not the greatest showman
","I really wanted to like this film. all the participants wanted that, too. they really worked very hard at it. the thing is this movie is boring. the two big numbers are generic and the songs are ho hum. the acting is all right, but nothing to write home about. hugh is ok, but he can do lots better. zac, can't dance, don't ask him. michelle, as wonderful an actress as she is, can't do much with a non part. it is not a bad movie. and you might enjoy it. just don't expect electricity on the screen.",6,3,7,31 December 2017
Jojo Rabbit," war games
","Not sure what the film maker was going for. satire. laughs. irony. your guess is as good as mine. nothing really works. a young boy has hitler as an imaginary friend. he discovers jews are human beings, like himself. bad things happen. etc.",5,7,44,30 October 2019
The Sixth Sense," wow.
","I see dead people. that's what the boy says in the trailer. apparently I didn't hear what he said, because I didn't get it. the critics were brutal to this early august entry into the end of summer movie universe. they said the direction was weak, you could drive trucks through the holes in the story, everything was obvious and they ignored bruce willis. entlrely. the golden globes ignored it, too, as did all the critics list's of the best of 1999. so how do we explain that the film turned out to be the second biggest grossing movie of the year, after star wars. the movie paying public loved it. the academy noticed this phenom and came up with six nominations, including best film and director. bruce was ignored, again. he makes the movie work, but whatever. haley joel osment became a star. toni collette was also nominated. even after seeing it twice, it still works, because it's done so well. gimmicy, sure. unbelievable, yup. enjoyable, absolutely. m. night shyamalan couldn't repeat this stunt, although 'unbreakable' was pretty good. sixth sense is a great movie.",10,1,2,13 September 2016
Life," familiar territory
","this film lacks originality, tension, wit, suspense. whatever. you know from the trailer that something bad happens. so there is no surprise there, either. people do dumb things all through the movie. a pet peeve of mine. the screen writers wrote Deadpool, from last year, so they must have had easy access to ryan Reynolds. there is sequence about 3/4 through where I had no idea what was going on. stick with alien from '79.",5,0,4,13 April 2017
John Wick: Chapter 2," action galore
","I reckon you saw the first john wick, so you know what to expect this time. I didn't, so I didn't. apparently mr. wick has retired, but unfortunately for him and his dog with no name, he has an iou outstanding, which must be paid back. mr. wick refuses to honor his commitment, and as is usual with these things, there are consequences. and so, mr. wick takes on his assignment. with gusto. I lost count of how many heads were blown off, but it was a lot. the audience applauded at the end. so there. in all honesty, the action sequences are spectacular, the scenery is beautiful and the whole thing looks expensive. Laurence fishburne has a nice cameo as a pigeon fancier. john leguizamo fans will be disappointed. I must give mr. reeves a lot of credit for getting from beginning to end.",7,0,12,11 February 2017
Annihilation," foolishness, wrapped in trash
",This is astonishing bad. nothing makes any sense and every character acts as if they had no brain. this must have been written for five guys and then one of the 'suits' in Hollywood thought let's put gals in these parts. this is not a film about five strong women. trust me. save your money.,1,97,217,25 February 2018
The Nice Guys," didn't work for me
","I should have been on high alert when the studio changed the trailer. the second one was better. the story is two guys looking for a missing girl. Russell is a tough guy and Ryan is a detective. I know what the screen writer was going for-laughs-unfortunately these two aren't comedians and can't deliver funny lines. they have absolutely no chemistry together. Ryan has a young daughter who is thrown into the mix, and in many instances the atmosphere is inappropriate for her age group. I guess that is supposed to be funny. I enjoy these guys very much as actors, so I was disappointed. I realize movies are subjective and I notice the 8+ rating. I also noticed that if this is a success there will be a sequel.",5,52,100,20 May 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," exciting ride
","although I am not the target audience for this film, I recently saw the chrome version. in 2015, the movie was nominated for best picture/director, among other noms, and since I missed it then I thought I would catch it now. I agree with reviewer tannerbrown. this is one hell of a ride and the action never stops. it's exhausting, really. I don't know how the director and actors managed to make it to the end. whatever the story, it doesn't matter. trust me. just have fun and enjoy the experience. there doesn't seem to be a lot of cgi stuff and if there is, it's hard to tell. in most movies cgi sticks out like a sore thumb. not here. glad I saw it.",8,0,4,8 November 2016
Alien: Covenant," so familiar
","the audience sat with rapt attention while the movie kept repeating itself. nothing has changed since 1979, except sigourney weaver is not here. and I might say, sorely missed. I am not sure what ridley scott is trying to do. I can't fault the movie technically, it's very dark, almost mesmerizing in a way. the acting is blah, but not much is required. except when the aliens start to emerge from your body. lots of screaming. the dialogue is embarrassing. i'm sure it didn't come cheap, either. also, if you love Michael fassbender you are in for a treat. of sorts. only a 73% on rotten tomatoes, which pretty much matches the 6.9 by IMDb reviews.",Null,1,5,21 May 2017
