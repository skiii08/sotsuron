Iron Man 3," Divided response
","I can't work out whether I like this film and for some reason every newspaper review I've read can't seem to give it enough praise, which personally I found very confusing. So I'm glad to see from these other reviews that people are pointing out similar issues with the film that ruined the experience for me. The main thing that stands out is that this doesn't feel like an Iron Man movie at all. If I were to review it as a film isolated from the Marvel franchise, I would probably say it was fun, witty and had a good amount of action. However it is an Iron man movie and this is where my problem lies.One of my greatest pleasures about watching these films is seeing Tony create and step into the Iron Man suit. More than anything Iron Man is cool and the previous films really capture this. This film just doesn't do the Iron man suit justice. I didn't like the new design of the suit. The suit seemed incredibly vulnerable in comparison to past movies and contradicts the powers of the suit. But my main problem was that there wasn't much Iron Man. Every Iron Man film should always fulfill one thing, and that's Tony Stark being Iron Man and there just wasn't enough of this, even the longest sequence Iron Man sequence (plane scene) you find out Tony is remotely controlling it, so he isn't even in it.Don't get me wrong, I love Robert Downey Junior as Tony Stark and he gave a good performance in this film. But I'm paying to see what Tony Stark can do as Ironman, not what Tony Stark can do without Ironman and ultimately this left me leaving the cinema feeling unsatisfied.If your not particularly a big fan of the Iron man franchise you'll probably enjoy this film. But if like me you're an Iron man fan and you still haven't seen the film, don't hold your expectations too high, as there will be various things that will annoy you that I haven't touched upon.",5,1,4,2 May 2013
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Best individual character film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe yet!
","The Marvel Cinematic universe is obviously smashing the box office at the moment and I can only guess they are going to carry on doing so. This film is the best film in the series aside from the Avengers and I had a great time watching it.Despite the Marvel series of films obviously being huge successes at the box office and well received amongst audiences I feel a few of their titles outside the Avengers have left me feeling a little bit disappointed, I think both Thor films are mediocre but worth a watch, the first Captain America was okay and I didn't particularly enjoy Ironman 3 (but I am a fan of the first 2). But what they have achieved with this film is a standard which is on the same level as the Avengers. Good Story, brilliant fight sequences showcasing each of the characters individual styles, solid cast and all the characters are likable too.POTENTIAL SPOILER: The only thing I would criticise is that Hawkeye isn't in the film at all and considering this is pretty much a film about SHIELD it seems weird he doesn't pop up at some point.But all in all go see this film, I think you will have a good time!",10,2,5,29 March 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," A really good Spider-Man film
","I really enjoyed this film. The first film came under some criticism especially by lovers of Raimi's trilogy, but I felt it took the necessary steps to redefine the character and it gives the sequel a solid platform to build on.The casting and performances of both Andrew Garfield as Spider-man and Dane Dahaan as Harry Osbourne are particular triumphs of this instalment. I also think Emma Stone does a good job. The Action sequences are exciting and are visually spectacular where they particularly succeed in showcasing Spiderman's powers.I've read some reviews complaining how this film is too much of a romantic flick, but ultimately the relationship between Peter and Gwen is key to the story and adds a much needed dimension to the standard Superhero movie. In fact these interactions between the two characters stand out as some of the best acting performances throughout film.So overall this is a good watch and I'd definitely recommend anyone to go check it out, my only real problem with it was some of the creative choices surrounding Jamie Foxx's character, especially in his characters normal form.But other than that go see it!",7,7,18,22 April 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Good sequel, solid instalment in the MCU, enjoyed it but didn't love it!
","First and foremost I'd like to say this is a good watch. Good action, decent villain and of course witty interactions between characters (which you now expect from a Josh Whedon Marvel Movie). I'm sure Fanboys and the average movie goer a like will be entertained by this flick. My main critique or question I would pose is that is there such thing as having one too many instalments in a film franchise? I've been anticipating this film for a long time and when you finally see it, it leaves you feeling slightly deflated in the fact that you're just thinking 'that ones done, whens the next one'. With this constant continuation I'm not getting any sense of resolve. This film really felt like look here's another Avengers flick to watch in the meantime while we build up to the real showdown with Thanos in another 6 films time. It's just starting to feel a little bit bloated.",8,0,3,29 April 2015
