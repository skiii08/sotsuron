Hereditary," Worst Horror movie ever
","I really don't know from where all of those good reviews came from, this movie was incredibly boring, like really really boring! I went to see this movie with my girlfriend to scare her at some moments but I didn't had the chance at all because this movie was not a horror movie, real horror movies such as Halloween, The Conjuring or Insidious, those movies are real horror movies with a good plot, a good history and THE MOST IMPORTANT: A GOOD ENDING. That movie was really trash.",1,6,14,19 June 2018
