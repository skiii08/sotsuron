First Man," respectfully, not for me
","There is good in this movie...but for me it wasnt enough.
What i liked is that this could have been a propaganda movie...with all the heroic music that comes with it. But i am grateful this wasnt the case. If propaganda music had been added to this movie i would have probably left during the seating. Instead, I fell asleep.
Sorry if i don't comment more it would be adding more of my precious time to some art that I didnt particularly enjoy because of its boredom.",1,0,3,5 November 2018
3:10 to Yuma," E pic. period.
","In the midst of movies that don't have a moving story, 310 to Yuma stands out. All the main bloody characters are memorable, good or bad. You might even find yourself rooting for some characters that are supposed to be bad.
Enough said, this movie is unique and not just as an epic western.",10,1,2,25 February 2018
Source Code," Has potential for a remake or sequel
","The concept of this movie is strong enough for a sequel or a remake.
A few adjustment here and there and it could have been much better.
Nevertheless it is worth more then one viewing: there is suspense, and twist turns that are interesting.",8,1,1,27 March 2018
As Good as It Gets," Quality movie
","This movie, is funny, it has romance and drama, it has quality acting....
And more.
It is an exploration of an interesting set of characters.
You will be drawn into their world.
Worth multiple watch. Well written. Engaging.",10,2,2,27 March 2018
Citizen Kane," Overrated. Waste of time.
","This movie was seen under my pledge to finish any movie I had started.
Otherwise I would not have finished it.
Back in 1941 when it was first released, perhaps people had not much else to watch...and so they were surprised by a mysterious film.
But we are now in 2018, and I can assure you, there is nothing entertaining in thei 2 hour movie.
Nevertheless, I am glad I saw it, so that I can judge the people who claim it is a masterpiece as people of little taste.....in my opinion. 
You have been warned.",1,6,11,31 March 2018
Memento," Bold. To say the least
","It is very tempting, and it is also fair, to compare Memento with Nolan's Prestige. Both require multiple viewing to fully grasp and enjoy the scenes.18 years later, Memento still puzzles. And when you finally think that you've understood it, the truth makes you shiver. Yes, this movie will make you discuss and argue its meaning.While I believe it could have been better in terms of sequencing, when I look at the progress that Mr. Nolan has made following this film, I can only applaud at his bold approach to Memento as stepping stone.
Bravo.",8,3,4,13 February 2018
The Prestige," Perfect
","Very few movies are worth seeing again and again.
This movie is dope.
The first time I saw this film i didn't quite understand it.
And once you understand it, it becomes a chilling story.
Because it is believable.
Worth it.",10,2,3,7 February 2018
The Hateful Eight," great movie
","Quenting Tarantino managed to keep me interested.
It was a very unique story with unique setting and development.
The cast was great.
Must see.",10,0,1,1 September 2018
The Bodyguard," Inspiring because unique
","Many things make this film unique, even as I am watching it in 2018, more then 25 years after it was released.
It was easy to be absorbed in the story and to follow along...
Not perfect, a little long perhaps but the suspense is very real and the romance very believable.
Overall a great film to watch with a date or just to be inspired if you think of playing the role of a bodyguard in a woman's life.",7,0,1,25 November 2018
Bird Box," when hype is well deserved
",This movie is good. has suspense. has a story. is unique. keeps you untill the end. it is worth it.,8,4,9,2 January 2019
The Village," Engaging thriller, unique
","This movie keeps you guessing, even when you know what is going on, you are not entirely sure what will happen. That is the recipe of any good suspense movie, right?
Yet this one is unique, definitely worth watching. I was surprise at the caliber of the different actors that featured in it. Great performances by all.",8,0,0,3 December 2018
Non-Stop," Worth multiple watch
","Without revealing too much, I will say that this film was interesting because it was not easy to predict the outcomes...
Indeed nothing is more boring than a story to which you can predict what will happen. Beside a good story we have here superior acting performances...even by supporting roles.
Fasten your seat-belt and enjoy more then average entertainment.",8,1,1,9 April 2018
Get Out," Worth several watch
","Watched it 3 times and still counting. This movie goes down in history. The acting is superb. In commenting this film, less is more., and let's not spoil it.
Go watch it !",10,24,49,7 March 2018
Schindler's List," epic proportion cinematography
","This movie is no small feat.
Well directed. Great actors, great story.
The pace of the movie is good; it takes a moment to get into it, but once you do it becomes quite easy to follow.
Not perfect but does the job",7,0,2,13 December 2018
A Quiet Place," Quality film
","Because little advertising, you might not have heard about this film. It may surprise you, in a good way.
It is original. 
Somehow the writers get you into the story and carry you on the edge of your seat until the very end.
This film comes to save the entertainment industry at a time where it needs quality film.",9,2,3,15 April 2018
Dog Day Afternoon," Don't delay watching it
","Do not be confused by the year of release, this is a good, modern movie.
The dialogue written and plot is very well made . It is even better if you do not know the real story prior to watching this.
Overall you are captivated until the very end. You also may find yourself rooting for the so call 'bad' guys.
It is probably not easy to infuse humor into an action/drama movie but this is an example where it works very well.
Bravo.",7,1,2,6 June 2018
The Artist," Definitely worth the watch
","I was skeptical at first. These were my exact thoughts: I will be bored to death by this silent black and white movie. Boy was I wrong. From the start to the finish, I liked it. This is the first full length silent movie I ever saw and it was worth it.",10,2,5,14 June 2018
The Hurricane," Different.
","The noise AROUND the film and the real events can make it hard to just enjoy the film for what it is. It can put a lot of pressure on viewers who just want to enjoy a film.
Once you put aside the noise, you will notice that the film makers tried to show the climate of an era that had a lot of tension between races. You might be tempted to take sides. Personally, I felt unsatisfied by the theme of the movie. I only watched it because someone said Hurricane was a hero and I wanted to make my own opinion.
After watching this film, I realize I may never find the truth.
If that is the case, I can judge this as a fiction story, and to me it was a poor one.",5,0,1,7 March 2018
Sicario," pointless
","There is a way to tell a story...
and this movie may have a decent story...
but it is presented in a way that makes little sense.
the scenes are for dramatic effect mostly,
i just feel like the point of the story was complicated for no reason.",3,0,2,26 June 2020
Ray," 'Ray' is an interesting glance into a celebrity's life
","First, let's say that the acting performances were well dont by all .We are brought into the world of a blind man. But he is more then a blind man. He has a gift. Is that gift powerful enough to help him overcome his curse ?In a way this movie is very interesting because it is real. I liked the story of the man, period. Usually I like more action and twists and turns in a movie...but I promised myself to finish this movie and it was worth it.What i feel could be better is if we had been showed other character's point of view. At times, we were introduced to characters and we could've branched out and learned more about ttheir side of the story....but I understand this was about Ray.Overall it was good.",7,0,2,27 March 2018
Fifty Shades of Grey," Depressing. Boring (in no particular order)
","The first 15 minutes of the movie is the best part: it is the part when you anticipate something great. But that something never happens...unless all you wanted was to look at a couple naked.
I finished watching this film while multitasking...i finished it only because i'm trying to understand why women gladly support the financial survival of this piece of art.
If you feel like risking time go ahead, but don't say I didn't warn you.
There was no tension, nothing to keep the viewers interested.",1,1,3,10 March 2018
Heat," Well done
","The writers of this story have courage: without spoiling the movie I will say that they managed to bring us unexpected turns of events.
Therefore the main actors deserve much respect for accepting their roles for a film that is somewhat unconventional.
Unconventional in a good way: the backstories add a sort of mystique to a movie that has already a dark theme.
The movie-watcher will be uncomfortable not knowing for whom to cheer. The whole experience can grow under your skin because it has suspense.
For all of these reasons, Heat deserve multiple watching if you have the time.
It is well worth it.",9,2,3,2 February 2018
Braveheart," Mixed impression
","There is good and there is bad a bout this film.
The good part is that the characters command attention. They are people that you feel close to...so, great acting by most actors.
The overall story is simple and interesting enough. I t has mixed types of concerns that the heroes are involved in.
But is movie is over 2 hours long and I wish it had been much much shorter.",5,1,4,22 April 2018
Her," The idea is great
","The idea for this movie is great. the actors all do a phenomenal job. Ans it is interesting to watch.
I felt however that the film lost some power 3/4 of the way through...maybe 2/3.
With a powerful finish this movie could be a masterpiece.
Still worth the watch.",5,0,0,17 June 2018
The Martian," very good
","This is a unique story. And although it is fiction, it is believable, set in the near future.
The casting for this movie is exceptional. Exceptional. The supporting actors show a lot of flexibility.
Definitely worth the second watch.",10,0,2,24 July 2018
