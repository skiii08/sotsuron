Mission: Impossible III," Mission Impossible back on form.
","I loved the first movie and enjoyed the second. The third has perfectly bridged the gap between the plot driven first and its action oriented sequel. The action, as expected was first class, with some incredible stunt-work and set-pieces. The opening scene shows some of Cruise's best acting in my memory and is one of the highlights of a fine film. Philip Seymour Hoffman is a fantastic villain for the piece, probably the best performance in the film. One criticism I have is the lack of development of some of the supporting cast, particularly Cruise's IMF team, who with the exception of the returning Ving Rhames we no next to nothing about the team. This is only a small concern and the heavy action makes up for some of these niggles. I felt the end was poorly conceived compared to the rest of the movie and was a disappointment. Overall I thought this was a cracking film and despite the flaws it is, in my opinion, the best film of the 3. Definitely worth a watch, I will be getting the DVD when it comes out.",9,0,1,10 May 2006
Blade," Great Vampire movie
","This is one of those rare comic-book movies that really works. In many, the fairly one dimensional characters just seem poorly written, but in Blade, with the heavy duty action and thumping techno soundtrack, it just seems to work.Blade is one of the great underrated characters in Marvel comics, and Wesley Snipes brings him to life and plays the role with such gusto that he really makes the part his own, to the extent that I really cannot imagine anybody else in that role. Blade is one of those great anti-heroes that makes you feel that maybe you shouldn't be rooting for him, but you cannot help doing so anyway. Without giving anything away, I think that the opening scene is one of the greatest character introductions ever.Unusually for a comic-book movie, the characters and plot manage to hold together until the end and I for one, after seeing it for the first time on TV, immediately bought the DVD.Blade is a fast action thriller that never lets up. I loved this movie and I would argue that it's better than either of its sequels.",8,0,2,6 October 2005
Blade II," great but I preferred the original.
","This is a great movie, and I really enjoyed it. To pick between this and the original is a tough decision, but I would have to side with the original. This is because despite the action sequences being fantastic the film lets itself down on 2 fronts for me.1 - Despite being a good character, Nomak is not in the same league as Deacon Frost in the original. The fact that Blade is given only a weak reason to fight Nomak means that there is none of the chemistry or intensity to the battles that the original had.2 - The introduction of the Blood Pack draws attention away from Blade. This is not good, we paid the admission fee so we could see Blade kicking some suckhead ass, not a bunch of vampires.Despite this, the film is fantastic and only slightly worse than the original. it is still an essential purchase for any action fan.",7,0,1,6 October 2005
