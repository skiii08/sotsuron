The Blair Witch Project," Left to the imagination
","The Blair Witch Project is a definitive masterpiece of cinema.  It is refreshing to note that money, special effects and big names are no substitute for a good story, good acting and fantastic direction.  The suspense gradually builds and eventually seems to exude from the screen and grab you somewhere in the chest until the shear horror of the characters situation hits you.  The picture and sound quality are poor due to the financial restrictions of the project but they just serve to enhance the feeling of realism generated by some superb acting.  This may be a low budget effort but having seen it, I know for a fact that no amount of special effects or big name actors would have enhanced this movie.  I saw this film three weeks ago and I still cant get the ending out of my head, what a clever film this is and you must do it justice by viewing it in a dark room and on your own and leave the rest to your imagination.",9,1,2,30 April 2000
