Ford v Ferrari," Good but Less Than The Sum of it's Parts
","This is very well directed movie, filled with top notch acting, and some real gripping car races that I enjoyed and really wanted to love, but kept having this nagging feeling like they were checking off boxes.It has this old fashioned feel to it, which I actually enjoyed but may put off others that may believe it drags (specially at the start). Someone actually starting snoring in the theater.But honestly this is a good enough movie, that at the end of the day, could have been better; the relationships between the masterfully performed characters deserved to have been carve out a little more.Also almost everyone seemed, so it was hard to root for anyone; but I guess that is why the performances were partly so good, we were shown real people. Again just wished more of a deep dive into what made everyone tick.7/10",Null,1,4,18 November 2019
Captain Marvel," A Chore: Feels Like They Were Checking Off Boxes Under the Heading: MCU FORMULA
","This reminded to those MCU's Phase 1 films from over 10 years ago. From the story telling and character development, it all reminds me of those early MCU movies. Therefore, yes it is a fine movie, true; but I expect more after Guardians, Ragnarok, Black Panther, and Infinity War.I am sure plenty of people will enjoy this, since it follows the MCU formula. But if feels like they had a list that needed to be checked off. And when you tackle what should be a creative project as a list, it ends up feeling more like a chore than art.To be more specific, too much is happening (an at a break neck speed) at the start and at the end of the film, but in between, unfortunately not much is happening. Finally, characters are not fully fleshed out or their relationships feel forced, same for the jokes, specially the ones by Captain Marvel. Even the always charismatic Nick Fury, could not be saved by Samuel L. Jackson.7/10 - Well polished, checks off all the boxes, and it's nostalgia shinny, BUT ultimately hollowed inside.",7,1,3,14 April 2019

","I have read reviews that compared this to phase 1 Marvel movies, and they are not that far off.

Us," The Revolution Will Not Be Spoon-fed
","Do not go to see US expecting another Get Out this is more like The Purge. But do go expecting Jordan Peele's attention to detail, artistry, and chilling atmosphere.This is an intricate, thought provoking, work of art that tries to not spoon-feed you it's layers of meaning.10/10",10,8,20,1 April 2019
Avengers: Endgame," The MCU's Crowning Jewel
","The waiting turns out to be worth it. Endgame is a satisfying, thrilling, dazzling, entertaining finale to MCU's story arch.The movie is long and the beginning is more about picking up the pieces and dealing with lost, thus it's purposely paced much slower than the rest. But that is the reason exactly why the movie is so emotionally impactful. After the final battle and all the sacrifices that were made, the silence was palpable in the theater.I can't find any scene, character, or dialogue that did not serve a purpose here.This is a wondeful action movie, a brilliance of special effects, and a masterpiece of a superhero movie. The MCU's crowning jewel.10/10",10,1,4,28 April 2019
Toy Story 4," It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it is good enough.
","Toy Story 4 is a fun time for entire family.It actually feels more like Toy Story 3.5, more of the same. And that is not necessarily a bad thing. It had some teachable moments there too, but it sort of contradicted itself somewhat for the sake of the plot.Regardless 8/10",8,1,3,22 June 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino is a gift to cinema, but he needs a film editor pronto.
","Tarantino's films are long, sometimes TOO LONG, like this review lol but usually I don't mind this, because the scene setting and dialogue is phenomenal, and makes it all worth the 5 minutes you just saw someone ride around with one foot out the car window or smoke a cigarette as if it is the last one on earth.But in this case, the dialogue was not up to my expectations and I could not relate with with the privilege Hollywood of old, has-been, nostalgia that was mostly the theme of the movie.I will say this though, it is a reimagining of real life events, so knowing more about them may help, I sadly did not know this until after. Always avoiding spoilers did not work out this time around.I must admit anytime Leonardo DiCaprio or Brad Pitt were on the screen the movie shined, but Tarantino overindulged too much on others, and those scenes were not fun or helped develop much.Now that I know what it was based on, I now understand why the characters were there, but regardless the movie dragged at times.I give it a 6.5/10!.... because there was a good üê∂ dogo.Watch it at home. And fast forward any time Brad or Leonardo take too long to appear again.",6,2,5,11 August 2019
Midsommar," Could Have Been a Great Short Film
","Midsommar is a creepy, well crafted, chilling feature.You can see it is made with attention to detail, and I always appreciate that, but the pacing is slower than needed. To the point that It feels se are getting more of the same in between far in between tense moments.As the wife correctly put it: 'that would have been a great short film.'7/10",7,1,2,7 July 2019
Joker," A Thought Provoking Masterpiece
","I am going straight to the point: this movie is a masterpiece.I have no idea what some critics are smoking.If you go looking for a superhero movie, you will be disappointed. But you will witness a thought provoking deep dive into many topics that trouble society; from mental illness and the total disregard of others, all the while embroiled in our usual sanctimonious contempt.Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar. Not many movies' attention to detail help catch me off guard, but this did; and plenty of times.It was exquisitely crafted. You know this was created thoughtfully and with careful orchestration when I was able to connect with what I felt was the message, but quickly noticed that almost anyone could connect and find their own message.The movie does not have a moral compass and does not spoon feed you a predictable heroic take or tragedy. It gives you art, and let's you make up your own mind. It may leave people conflicted, and some may not like that. Some need good vs evil, Darth Vader vs Luke Skywalker, Tony vs Thanos. Well life does not work like that, not does the Joker movie.And what a movie, a movie for the ages. Almost anyone can relate it to their life, hopes, and struggles... for example, I can easily imagine liberals will watch it and feel it was about *the resistance* BUT, at the same time, a staunch MAGA hat wearing viewer can watch it and believe it was about *draining the swamp*, etc.Joker 10/10",10,3,7,19 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Did you like... It (2017) and you found Pennywise creepy AF, well throw that out the door.
","This movie is full of special effects, gross monsters, jump scares, and even jokes sprinkled everywhere.It is like when Thor made a left turn to Ragnarok and started throwing one liners, but with a lot of unecessary scenes.This movie was too long, it dragged at times, and I missed the serious creepy version of it.The audience clapped at the end, I guess jump scares, and crazy grossed monsters is enough for most. Also the love triangle made no sense to me, but I am not a hopeless romantic, so to each its own.Great casting job and acting though, top notch.Watch it at home and fast forward until you see pennywise or Bill Harder (if you want the jokes).7/10",7,0,0,11 September 2019
Black Panther," The Most Polished and Mature entry to the MCU yet.
","The critical acclaim is well deserved. It may not be a perfection or the best Marvel movie ever, but it is arguably the most well rounded and mature Marvel movie yet. Definitely top 5 when it comes to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, arguably top 3.",9,2,6,14 April 2019
Annihilation," A Beautiful Concept Bugged Down by a Flawed Story
","This is a film to be seen at the theater, not because it is great, but because is cinematography and suspense begs for it.With that said, the pacing of the story and decisions made by characters left me puzzle. But glad I saw it at a theater with a big screen and encompassing sound, but this a movie I'll not be revisiting.",7,0,1,14 April 2019
