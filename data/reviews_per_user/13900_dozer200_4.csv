Who Framed Roger Rabbit," A Classic!
","This movie beats any other cartoon meets human movie ever made. I would have to say it also tops any carton movie ever made. The plot is good, the story line is great, it includes almost all cartoon characters. You cant go wrong with this film. This is a top ten movie of mine. I have always loved this movie and i always will love this movie. Years of talk about a sequel made my head turn. Although there probably will never be a sequel, the movie is enough fun to last a lifetime.",10,0,1,2 July 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," One of the most original ideas ever
","This film is my favorite film of all time. There will never be another film like it. Ive heard both good and bad things about the movie but the first time i saw this movie i couldnt believe they could even create such magic on the big screen. The plot, the characters, sound effects, special effects, the music...you name it. This movie had it all and i personally, along with millions of other fans, cannot wait for the sequels to come.",10,0,0,2 July 2000
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The ultimate adventure
","This movie is an instant recommendation to anyone of all ages. Even though i love the whole trilogy i would have to choose this one as the best and many people i know agree with me. The beginning and the ending to the whole trilogy is the best but the ending to this one had the most creative and well thought out plan. Excellent action in this movie too, it doesnt stop for harrison ford. This movie has everything you would want any adventure movie to have in it...you name it. This is within my top ten movies of all time.",10,1,2,2 July 2000
Back to the Future," Well thought out plan
",This movie is a classic. One of my top ten movies of all time. The whole trilogy is great. I could never figure out why they never made a trilogy box for this series. This is definetly one of the greatest movies of all time in my opinion and in other opinions. Who wouldve thought a Deolorian could take you so far. The whole trilogy is well thought out and the effects are excellent even for today. There is no doubt in my mind that this is one of the best.,10,1,2,2 July 2000
