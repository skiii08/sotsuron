Scarface," Powerful, classic '80s gangster flick
","A very powerful, extravagantly violent update of the old gangster-film genre that just radiates all the excess and egotism of the 1980s. Pacino is in top form as a Cuban refugee in this dark, socially-challenging take on the old 'rags-to-riches' stories that epitomize American capitalism. Using the 1980 Mariel Boatlift as a launching point, two potent filmmakers (writer Stone and director DePalma) challenge '80s myths of wretched excess and narcisscism, and it could not have been done without Pacino's brilliance at portraying the self-obsessed, arrogant yet insecure hero Tony Montana. A good film to compare and contrast with 'The Godfather,' (daring immigrants, American dream, underworld morals, etc.) but this time the film's focus is on a single determined man rather than a large organization.",Null,1,2,5 July 2001
