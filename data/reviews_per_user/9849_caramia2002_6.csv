The Devil's Advocate," The True 'Bonfire of the Vanities'
","I just watched this film for the probably 12th time. I bought it right after I first saw it on HBO, I think, and have enjoyed it ever since. It is everything the Bonfire of the Vanities wasn't, all the more shame due to the cast and source novel, not to mention, the marketing budget. They don't make them like this anymore; the script is so smart, the editing and pacing are perfect, and, although the reveal at the end is a great reveal on the first viewing, the journey then becomes the main thing. Even so-called 'good' or award winning films of today usually pale in comparison, esp when everything is added together (and the southern accents are usually much worse than these).This is the best I've seen Keanu Reeves act. Granted, they keep his lines short and sparse, as is usually done for him, but the script has been tailored to his acting style and it works. He does much more than grunt or cast looks, as he is limited to in films such as Wick or even The Matrix. What he does have is a marvelous physical presence (and I don't mean looks, although he is young and pretty here), which is used to its full extent in this film. I don't really spend much time wondering what a real actor would have added to this movie. Likewise, this part and the lines are just up the alley of Al Pacino. He was into his irritating and cliched 'acting like Pacino acting' by this time, but he is less about being Pacino than being in character here, so easily his best performance of these years. I imagine some of his excellent speeches are lifted from the novel, but the adaptation works so so well, and he benefits from such a smart script. His small stature is used, as his lifts are noticed by Reeves early on ('they never see me coming') and the camera never tries to hide his diminutive size. But Pacino knows how to be a presence, as he does so well here.This was Charlize Theron's breakout film. She does a very credible job and you can see the actress who went on to play a role like Monster. She never falls into the horror actress trap of overacting and is perfect for the part of a naive, small town girl thrown into the deep end of NYC. This is Connie Neilsen's first film, and she is spectacular, although she mostly plays the sexy redhead, but the charisma that fueled Gladiator comes through here. I love Tamara Tunie (Tony winner), who has the meatiest role among the 'wives'. This film is jam packed with acting talent and all are used well. The only issues are the southern accents of Reeves and Theron, but they aren't horrid and better than what you see today. Easily forgiven.My old DVD has the original sculpture with the people (later turned into waves after a lawsuit), but my Blu-Ray doesn't and I think it takes quite a bit away from the impact of Pacino's office. The original sculpture returns near the end, so the intent is kept, if not delayed. My copy doesn't have the WTC Twin Towers, which were removed for TV, shortly after 9/11, even though it is the theatrical release. The power and the glory of the NYC skyline, as used in this film, sorely needs them. It's all about iconic power.I am not into horror films, per se, but this is not really a horror film, nor really a thriller, nor just a drama. It is rich with sub-plots, but never gets lost in them, nor are any dead ends. It is supernatural, but otherwise is genre defying. It suggests horror and violence more than it shows it (restraint!). I think the filmmakers wanted the audience to be more uncomfortable than shocked. If you love film, this is a must for your library. Not iconic, over the top great, but enjoyable, very watchable, excellent filmmaking. Glad the reviews are trending up; none were too kind on its release. One of the most underrated films ever.",9,0,1,19 October 2019
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," The Ultimate in 'Group Think' Cinema Myth
","I saw this when it came out, at the theater, as a high school kid. Even then it was boring. Nothing like The Sting. I was happy to be on a date and just glad to be out with my boyfriend, so I have good memories of that night, but the movie was the least of them.This movie did fit the zeitgeist of the time perfectly (anti-heroes = counterculture). After all, this was the year of Easy Rider, Midnight Cowboy, The Wild Bunch, and many others in this style, but BC&SK was by far the worst of them. It was the first Western which incorporated pop culture and music. It was the 'thing' to see it on a date. It hit pop culture like a canon. I remember people dressing up like the characters of Redford, Newman, and Ross and getting photographs in sepia enlargements for proud display. Lines from the movie were oft repeated, esp perhaps the movie first, 'Oh...sh....it!'. Several TV shows were spawned (all cheesy, too). Fashion was influenced. Every teenage girl wanted to be Katerine Ross (I did and I don't see why, now). 'Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head', was a huge pop hit, and stands up well today.And so this movie was all about the music. I don't think popular music had ever been used in a Western before, which explained much of its appeal. The music video, to the vocal pop song, 'Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head', introduced the relationship between Cassidy, the Kid, and Elle, and was gorgeously filmed. But unlike Easy Rider, this soundtrack then moved from the good to total cheese, with a 60s 'doobie doobie dooo...' vocal interlude, during a *chase* scene, of all things! While they were forgivable in commercials and Alfa Romeo gorgeous girl scarf trailing Italian movie scenes, they were not here. I feel a lot of nostalgia when I hear 60s 'doobie doobie dooo...'s, but they are still just cheesy remnants of that time. The rest of the Bacharach/David score was good, but nothing memorable. I'll take majestic Western movie music over this Western soundtrack, anytime, which better describes the sweeping majesty of Western locations. The music rarely induced any kind of excitement or suspense, either. Doobie doobie doooooooo...The script was terrible, with Newman and Redford taking up the slack with their so-called chemistry and renowned sex appeal. I can't believe William Goldman, a notable novelist and screenwriter (The Princess Bride, Marathon Man, All the President's Men, and many more) penned this AND won an Oscar for it (over Midnight Cowboy, etc????). It was an innovative script only in that the outlaws escaped and had more adventures after, which gave the movie an excuse to last another hour. It lost my interest after the music video, however, and went seriously begging for plot through to the end. Bad direction and editing was to blame here. There was too much 'filler', like still photos panned over too long, instead of the real scenes, which looked like they would have been far more interesting. Likewise, the extended chase scenes quickly lost their charm, as they were not designed well and had none of the elements that we expect from chase scenes. Of course, only so much you can do with a horse chase. Other than that, the well filmed (although too many strange telephoto shots) western country at least gave us something of value to watch and won an Oscar (they weren't THAT great, if you compare any John Ford Western, or the love song to NYC that Midnight Cowboy's cinematography was, or even Easy Rider's America).In the end, this is a movie which relies on music, the pairing of Redford and Newman, in their prime, cute banter, and MTV slickness, but lacks in any substance whatsoever. To call it 'great cinema' is a real disservice to truly great cinema. After the music video bike scene, it is all downhill and if this movie was released today, it would be a complete flop. Virtually nothing happens in the last 3/4 and no one would now put up with that.I hate to offend so many people, but I think the high ratings are from those who accept pop culture's myths without thinking for themselves, or who haven't seen the movie since its release and since they grew up, now without the zillions of $$ of promotion, which made the myth before the myth was even seen. The ultimate in 'group think'. You just cannot watch this NOW and write a favorable review, unless you specify the first third. If you were alive when it came out, watch it again to see the truth. If you weren't, don't bother, you will never get the time back. Funny, I almost didn't watch it today, as I always thought of it as rather boring, and wondered what didn't I get that everyone else seemed to. I did and it was.",1,4,14,12 July 2018
Yesterday," Across the Universe
","Rated so highly for the music only. Along with Bohemian Rhapsody, Rocketman, et all, Yesterday is another attempt to revitalize old catalogues and make money (The Beatles' Apple Corps is involved, natch). But beyond that, it paints the music of The Beatles on a new canvas and, as in the film, creates a different universe for iconic songs some of us heave heard for most of our lives (I was 11 when The Beatles came to the US). So it was great to hear these mostly stripped down arrangements presented in a world which didn't know The Beatles (due to the intersection of a parallel universe or something). They are simple arrangements, but allow the songs to shine and the genius behind them to become even more apparent. In one sense, they are in the pantheon of the millions of Beatles' covers, but then again, they are very fresh, spare, and modern, performed convincingly.Other than the music, this is a very mediocre film. 'Saved by the music' has rarely been more true. It's watchable and never boring, but if not for the music, I probably would have stopped watching at the 10th joke I didn't laugh at (did get a chuckle out of the Googling, though). It's totally formulaic romcom. There are so many better places the film could have gone, questions tackled. Like would the songs have been iconic hits without Beatlemania (kind of implicitly answered)? Or even a realistic idea of where popular music went without them (apparently a world without Oasis but with the vapid and unoriginal Ed Sheeran (who gets WAY too much screen time). Yet The Beatles completely rewrote the music business, radio, recording, the album concept, group singer-songwriters, and rock music itself so it's likely neither Oasis nor Ed Sheeran would exist in that world. That Sheeran and Oasis are used as the conduits to the Beatles for modern youth is beyond shameful.I lost it when Jack meets the alternative John Lennon, age 78. It is a very touching scene and punctuates the tragedy of his death so young. I hope Yoko doesn't see this movie, and I guess that makes this (unnecessary) scene tasteless at worst, maudlin at best. This scene was not integral to the movie in any way, so seemed sad opportunism.If you are too young to remember, start with the revolutionary Rubber Soul, or fire up a blunt with Sgt. Pepper. After Abbey Road, go back to the beginning. Rinse, repeat for your whole life.",8,0,0,13 September 2019
Crazy Heart," Hype Can't Cover a Very Uncomfortable Moment
","I did not know that Jeff Bridges won an Oscar for this until I was a quarter into it. I was shocked. The first thing I thought was that it must have been a very weak field, indeed. I love Jeff Bridges but you can see every bone in his body acting as he tries but fails to find the character or a great performance. Too obvious, insincere Kristofferson gravely voice. He has done better and for which he deserved an Oscar. Shame he got one for this, and I imagine he is more than a little sheepish, esp if he is the genuine actor I think he is and can still see through his ego.This movie has been made many times, and much, much better. Tender Mercies, Payday, A Star is Born, Rock Star (even the Kristofferson version is much, much better than this movie, and you get the real guy). Not to mention more recent fare, like Walk the Line and the James Brown biopic (I dare you to compare Juaquin Phoenix's Johnny Cash to Bridges here!). That is a list of movies to see and unlike this one, they are memorable in a way that makes you rewatch them. True Oscar worthy performances in many. There is not a creative bone anywhere in this movie. The writing and direction are phoned in. Character motivation is zip, esp for Maggie Gyllenhaal, which makes the relationship between them gross. No convincing motivation for anyone. Colin Farrell is the class of the cast in his small role as Bridges' old student now famous. In a *good* movie, Farrell wouldn't have stood out as much, as the bar would have been so much higher and Farrell's performance expected.Robert Duvall has a couple scenes (fitting, since this tries to be Tender Mercies II) and in one he manages to completely negate and dehumanize a Mexican immigrant. The truly sad thing and why I bring this up is that this scene is completely redundant and unnecessary. Duvall speaks Spanish to a guy he calls 'Jesus', who is pushing a mop pail across the floor. Duvall abruptly says, irritated, 'Someday I am going to teach you English!'. When Juan or Bridges (I forget and am NOT watching it again) points out that his name is really Juan, Duvall says, 'Juan, Jesus, whatever your name is, who cares?' Juan is immediately turned into 'one of those'. The man is not important enough to be correctly named. Just 'one of THEM', even though he is the only one left who is helping keep the bar open and has perhaps known Duvall a while. No, there was no appearance of Duvall being a spacey old coot, just mean-spirited and as if Juan was generic and replaceable, as many see immigrants. Duvall is powerful enough that he doesn't have to speak lines like that, but he did. I am just wondering how desperate Richard Gallegos was to do the role of Juan. They could have written any character into that role. Duvall's character's crusty old wife, a crusty old friend, his son, his best friend, and on and on. To be fair, the doctor who attends Bridges', earlier, seems to be Hispanic (they ARE in New Mexico and Arizona, after all) and that was a very good call. But that good diversity moment was negated with this unforgivable, stereotypical and insulting scene. But the director must take all responsibility for this nonsense, in the end. So he has written a terrible script (not just because of this, which seemed ad libbed, anyway) and directed a terrible movie, shot like a commercial, only slower. We never get a good look at some of the beautiful scenery the movie is shot in. I have lived in the southern New Mexico wasteland and was looking forward to that odd beauty, as well as driving into the gorgeous mountains as you go north, but the cinematographer doesn't allow us to settle our gaze upon the scenery.",1,0,6,14 June 2018
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Watched it Unaware
","That it was all in such long takes with so little editing. Thus I forgive the tiny foibles. What an achievement. I first watched this after it came out on home video and I guess I must have put it on right before bed or something, because I couldn't really remember it and thought it had a boring Hollywood fake plot device (silly comic action) when Riggan gets locked out. That might have improved the 1star reviews, sadly. I was entranced the entire time, and was sad when it ended. Bravura performances by many and why I love Inarritu as a director.I am so glad that Michael Keaton got to show off his considerable acting talents in such a manner. I have loved him since the beginning and have never quite forgiven him for taking on the Batman movies, although he was astonishingly good in what little I saw of Batman. All of the cast was amazing; this is far and away the best I've seen Ed Norton perform. Lindsey Duncan made a lasting impression and she was only in a couple scenes. I didn't care too much for whomever played Laura, the girlfriend. She never seemed to connect with the screenplay or direction, which is a bit forgivable as this film wasn't made in the usual and customary manner.The original soundtrack was brilliant and so crazy that it wasn't allowed into the Oscars. Sounds like politics to me. But it really put the icing on the film. Glad it won the Grammy, though.I was reminded of All That Jazz quite a bit during this film. A lot of similarities: Broadway plays, magical/deluded thinking, death wishes, ego and legacy, ex-wife, girlfriend, daughter. But this was a completely different movie, although not a better one in many ways (ATJ is one of my all time favs, but Birdman may become one).It left me conflicted that a major Hollywood studio backed this, as the satire is about the silliness and load of you know that Hollywood often contains. And many of the actors have been in comic book movies. So that kind of watered this film down for me a bit. I wished that the actors bought into the premise wholly, from the outside, and maybe some do (Keaton?). But to wish all that is to wish that Hollywood was not Hollywood and that the Marvel Universe has not taken over Hollywood so completely. Hollywood is lost, probably forever. In fact, this is one of the only worthy Best Picture films of most of this century, as it's just not profitable to make these kinds of movies and no one cares. I've pretty much decided that unless an actor really, really needs the money, that they are all the narcissists they are rumored to be, but I refused to believe (all that 'nice guy/gal stuff'). Why would you need to do more than one? Are their living expenses really THAT high or is the lure of blockbuster love so tempting and even necessary? It's a crazy world and I don't appreciate Keaton for adding to this trend, back when it wasn't one.I am dismayed at all the bad reviews, which I think is reflective of what people expect now. Most of those review I read got major plot points or script lines wrong, so I have to wonder if they watched it carefully or not at all. I think the advance press didn't do this movie any favors as most of the bile went to the 'artsy fartsy' direction. I don't watch TV, thus I had no idea beforehand. But if I had, I would have been even more impressed. But then I love films which try to challenge the norm (and after all, a play is nothing but 3 or 4 long scenes!). However, this is NOT an art film. That these reviewers have no idea what an art film is shows not to take those reviews seriously. And why did this film elicit so much anger? A bad Marvel sequel only gets, 'Well, I was expecting more...' and 6-7stars, but this gets all the anger of their movie going lives. I guess that about says it all...",10,1,1,30 September 2019
Munich," Whose boat *is* this, anyway?
","This kind of storytelling is what John le Carre is to spy books and why I fell in love with his work. I don't know who came up with the wonderful complexity, excellent storytelling, and suspense: Spielberg, the screen-writers or the writer of the original book; but it is movie-making and probably collaboration at its best. Even if Spielberg 'just' directed, which I can't imagine, he brought the story/script to life, gloriously. While giving much for discussion and thought.Best line - 'Whose boat is this, anyway?' (There *is* humor in this movie, black, but humor, nonetheless, which screams Spielberg (I have not seen any special features so this as well as my other comments may be addressed in those.) For the first time, I am happy NOT to see the special features.And there is one shot, just one, no people, no dialogue, nothing but a shot, but it says a million words and gives another million to think about and I'll let the viewer have the fun of finding it. And then the work of dealing with the emotions and implications of it and what goes on in this world.",10,2,4,7 July 2006
