Saturday Night Fever," Should have been on the top 250 list!
","It is a wonderful movie, telling the story of a troubled blue collar paint store helper, who at night is the king of disco. It is a representative of a place in time, and almost everyone knows about it. From the US to UK to Germany to India! It has inspired a generation, and that's why it should definitely be on the top 250, in the top 20 in fact.Sure it has a lot of vulgar scenes but now there is a PG version to it. It's Saturday Night catch the Fever. Tony Manero rock on! (And the Bee Gees too.) The most famous scene is Tony (John) strutting down the Brooklyn side walk with a paint can, and 'Stayin' ALive' playing in the background. Another favorite is when he dances solo in 2001 Odyssey (Studio 54?) with 'You should be Dancin'' playing in the back.",9,0,2,12 March 2005
