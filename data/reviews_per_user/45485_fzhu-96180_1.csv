Blade Runner 2049," Beautifully realized vision of an alternate future
","This movie will be the reason I buy a 4K TV; what an absolutely stunning film. It was quite the experience watching this movie in the cinema, along with breathtaking visuals the audience is treated to a kickass soundtrack. The acting is top notch; Ryan Gosling imbues Det. K with so much vulnerability that he is 'more human than human' - he definitely feels more alive than Wallace (Leto playing a cold, ruthless corporate master of the world) and/or Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright playing Det K's badass LAPD boss). Ana de Armas is brilliant as Joi and Harrison Ford briefly reprises his role as Deckard for the last act of the movie.I was quite pleasantly surprised watching this, was expecting it to be an action-packed reboot/sequel but it turned out to be more introspective, dystopian and heartfelt than the final cut of the original. The only reason I am not giving this film a 10/10 is because I would have liked the pace to have picked up once Deckard showed up and maybe have him do more as the film's promotion implied. Also, would definitely recommend watching the original before, there is a lot that happens in the movie that is related. A particularly standout scene is the one with Joi, Mariette and K - the interaction between these three is melancholy, mesmerizing and so heartfelt - you really start to hope that Joi and K will make it. BRAVO!!!",9,2,11,6 October 2017
