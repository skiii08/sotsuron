The Lobster," This is the worst movie I've ever seen. It's so bad, it can't even be so bad as to be funny.
","SERIOUSLY, HOW DOES THIS HAVE A 7.2 ON HERE AND EVERY REVIEW WITH WORDS IS A 1 EXCEPT FOR TWO OR THREE REVIEWS THAT ARE HIGH THAT MUST BE FROM SOMEONE INVESTED IN THIS GARBAGE. This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Not in a good way. I like bad movies. Bad movies that are so bad that you have to laugh at them. This isn't one of those movies. I made it all the way to the end. Don't make the same mistake that I did. Just don't. I can't somebody took the time to actually write this down, much less try to pitch it to somebody. On top of that, find a studio that was receptive to it, and actually make it to filming. What was Colin firth thinking? Is he broke and need the money? Did he not read the script? I wonder how many facepalms he did if he actually watched this. I'd rather pour salt and gasoline in my eyes and ears than to watch this again.",1,2,6,16 November 2019
