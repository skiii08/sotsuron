Requiem for a Dream," Boot to the head
","Well, one of my friends hightly recommended that I watch this movie, but I don't know if I would do the same.  It's a bitter look at addiction and consequences that I found downright disturbing.  I think it's best put like this, 'if reality is a boot, then this movie is kicking you upside the head.'  I made that up today at work.  It may not make much sense, but it's fun to say.",10,0,0,27 July 2002
