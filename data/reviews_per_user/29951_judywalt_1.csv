The Legend of Bagger Vance," excellent story
","People seem to forget that movies or films are fantasy not documentaries. This is a good story of a guy (Damon) that was traumatized by events in WWI and just doesn't give a damn about anything anymore but still has a tingle for Adele (Theron), now comes Bagger (Smith), an angel, evident at the end of the film when Hardy (Lemon) passes away on the golf course. Great narration by Jack Lemon as I think this was his last film and the story was excellent as most golfers would probably agree. Did that golf tournament actually take place?? Hell, I don't know nor do I care, it was nice to imagine Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen and Junnah golfing together, to take a trip to Savannah and think it did and that Junnah got his swing,courage,faith,honesty and Adele back. While Hardy (Lemon)is called by Angel Bagger(Smith)to join him. Some have complained that the story moved too slow, well it takes place in the 1930's, a much slower time and Golf is a slow game. As a golfer I liked it. My thanks to Robert Redford.",10,1,3,24 April 2005
