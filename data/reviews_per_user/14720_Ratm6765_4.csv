Requiem for a Dream," Breathtaking and Amazing
","First off, I need to get something off my chest before I comment on this movie. Those of you who compare this movie to Trainspotting and thus label it as an 'anti-drug' movie is a fool. Darren Aronofsky said himself that this movie is not really about drugs, but 'about love. More importantly, what happens when love goes wrong.' You can plainly see that the characters truly love one another; it's pretty much all they have. Their various addictions - mostly substance addictions - are chronicled not merely as a sign of weakness, but a comparison to their hopes and dreams. And I'm quite certain that's the way Hubert Selby, Jr., intended it to be when he wrote the book nearly 24 years ago.Sara dreams about being on television; her addiction to diet pills and obsession over the red dress emphasizes that.Harry, Marion, and Tyrone all dream about being successful; their addiction to cocaine, herion, etc, all reflect on that, and how they let their dreams overtake their conscience.The film itself is excellent. Definately one of the most amazing movies I've seen in quite some time. The cinematography is also great, and the performances by Burstyn, Leto, Connelly, and Wayans are all first-rate. But, my favorite part of the movie is its score. The soundtrack during the film is almost haunting.All-in-all, this movie is definately worth watching. If it leaves you speechless by the end of it...then Aronofsky has done his job. And if it leaves you with questions unanswered, here's one simple answer:'Because we choose to live the dream instead of living the life.'****/****(four out of four stars)",10,0,1,15 May 2002
Apocalypse Now," Haunting, yet powerful
","I usually watch movies purely for the entertainment factor. However, after watching Apocalypse Now Redux, I will no longer do that. Movies usually don't have an effect on me, but, this film certainly did. In particular, I find that Marlon Brando's performance was nothing short of amazing. I can't get his image out of my head. And even the soundtrack adds to the already-haunting surroundings of the Cambodian 'exploration.'However, I made the mistake of watching the Redux version first. It's not completely a flop: in fact, I think most of the new footage makes the film even better. But, I think that the USO and Medivac scenes could have been left on the cutting room floor. The French plantation scene, though, was absolutely great. And that scene where Colonel Kurtz reads an article from Time Magazine to Lieutennant Willard is just as good.Personally, I give this film four out of four stars. However, if you are new to this movie, do yourself a favor: watch the original 1979 version first, then proceed to Redux. Don't make the same mistake I did.",10,0,0,26 February 2002
Mulholland Drive," Not Lynch's best, but still a good film
","Fans of David Lynch's seem to be divided as to which of his films are his best. Most will say 'Blue Velvet'; others, 'The Straight Story' or 'The Elephant Man'. Does 'Mulholland Drive', Lynch's latest effort, deserve to have that title? No. Does it deserve to be watched, analyzed, and talked over as being one of the most fascinating films in recent years? Sure, why not?To the average moviegoer (you know, the ones that made 'Spider-Man' and 'Scooby-Doo' last year's big success stories) 'Mulholland Drive' is an incomprehensible film that no one in their right mind would be able to figure out. But to the people who paid attention, it's much, much more than that. David Lynch is practically challenging us, making us think for ourselves, instead of giving us every little detail. That's what makes this film so fun - we want to solve the mystery for ourselves because we want to know what's going on.It wouldn't be right for me to explain in detail just what the movie is entirely about for two reasons. Number one: every other reviewer, on the User Comments page and on the message board, has done that. Number two: even I'm not completely sure what Lynch's message is. Only he knows that. But, there is one easy way to understanding 'Mulholland Drive', and that's using the ten clues Lynch has provided us. It'll definitely take more than one viewing of the film to do that, but it's way more fun than just going to the message board and reading other people's explanations. Sometimes, however, a trip to the message board really helps.Possible spoilers ahead.I didn't really use the ten clues to help me when I saw the film for the first time, because I didn't know what I was in for. I knew that there was going to big a big twist two-thirds into the movie, but I was not prepared for what I saw. Lynch pulled a fast one on me. All of a sudden, we find out that the sweet, naive Betty Elms is actually Diane Selwyn, a Hollywood native who's dreams of making it big were crushed somewhere along the way. And the helpless Rita? She's actually Camilla Rhodes, a famous starlet who's been having an affair with Diane. Everything up until the point where Rita opens the blue box may or may not be part of Diane's dream. Nice job, Lynch - you gave us a film about two women on a Nancy Drew-like search for someone's true identity, and then turned that movie upside down to give us one about secret lesbian lovers, a dirty homeless guy behind a fast-food dumpster, a nightclub where everything is 'a recording', and some really tiny old people who'd scare the living bejesus out of anyone.End spoilers.But, even after all that, the film still remains logical. David Lynch might not tell his stories in the most linear fashion, but they're anything but incoherent. He's putting us to the test. He wants us to get past his trademark Lynchian elements and to construct a conclusion from what little help he provides. Only a director who respects his audience would ever dream of doing something like that. People who hate this movie because they 'don't get it' are just too lazy to put some effort into their moviegoing experience.Again, this might not be Lynch's best ('The Straight Story', IMO, holds that title), but it's worth two hours and twenty-seven minutes of your time to sit back and watch an entertaining film that makes the New York Times crossword puzzle look like 'Where's Waldo'.***/**** (three out of four stars)",Null,0,1,14 January 2003
Donnie Darko," Take that, David Lynch!
","Wow. It's been over a month since I first saw 'Donnie Darko,' and I still haven't forgotten about it. That's how good this film is. It grabs hold of you and doesn't let go.'Donnie Darko,' much like 'Memento' and 'Mulholland Drive,' is one of those rare films that has different interpretations from different viewpoints - everybody has their own idea as to what this film is all about. Whether it be love, hate life, death, religion, etc. - it doesn't really matter. Apparently, director Richard Kelly took all of the aforementioned elements, mixed them together, and the end result was one of the best films of the past five years.The main storyline of the film is simple. Donnie Darko, a high-school student from your average suburb in October 1988, has reoccuring visions of a six-foot-tall rabbit named Frank, who warns Donnie that the world will end on Halloween. That's the easy part. Now, you have to decipher what's really happening. Don't worry if you can't do that - Kelly unleashes lots of symbolism throughout the duration of the film that can be interpreted in many different ways (although most of the time, it's just downright silly).'Donnie Darko' is also amazing to watch. Kelly pulls out the numerous tricks up his sleeve. Fast-and-slow-motion, sideways camera views, and other special effects make this film even better. Plus, the eighties-themed soundtrack is awesome. As for the acting itself, the performances are better than average (especially from Mary McDonnell, the Gyllenhaal siblings, and even Patrick Swayze).It's worth every minute.****/**** (Four out of four stars)",Null,0,0,26 November 2002
