The New World," Truly awful
","Whilst i can appreciate that a lot of people somehow enjoyed this film, i feel that the reviews don't really give enough of a warning to people looking for a good movie to watch.I picked up this film with little knowledge of the director or the film itself. Had i known beforehand that the director was also responsible for The Thin Red Line, i would have put it back on the shelf straight away.Needless to say, this film had no entertainment value in it whatsoever, indeed there is little in the way of dialogue, just lots of shots of scenery that i'm sure some people found breathtaking, but if you want to see scenery, what on earth are you doing indoors watching a DVD...? I had hoped to maybe learn a little about Pocohontas in this film. I haven't watched the cartoon version, but you will learn more about the history of America from reading the back of the DVD than from actually watching the film.Avoid unless you are stuck in the centre of London with no decent scenery to look at...",1,3,8,29 May 2006
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Man, and I thought The Hateful Eight was bad....!!
","I'm sure there must have been a reason why 2+ hours of tedious nothing was filmed, followed by a few minutes of action. This is just an awful film, with no direction, plot or any sort of interesting storyline to it. If anybody else had come up with this script it would have gone straight in the bin of every movie studio going. I hope Tarantino stops now, I certainly won't be watching anything else he does....",3,5,11,22 November 2019
