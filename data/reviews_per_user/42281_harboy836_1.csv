10 Cloverfield Lane," John Goodman, good man
","John Goodman jumps into acid so the female doesn't feel bad her master trap failed, the other guy gets shot. The ending is a bit bad however not as bad as the devil inside as that is really a bad ending. To improve this film I would stop John Goodman from falling into the acid and keeping the ending from getting bad. The hob (nob monster) did have a good foreshadowing moment as Goodman had a master plan about them as mentioned by female, obviously not the other guy as I believe he was dead. To make this ten lines I would mention how good John Goodman is go watch.kind regards h. lee",8,4,7,1 April 2016
