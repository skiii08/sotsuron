Sucker Punch," Basically, The Great Escape on LSD!
","In Zack Snyder's stylistic breakout movie, a group of mentally unstable woman are placed in a mental ward, and to breakout, they imagine it as a prison.This was an okay movie, it's not award worthy, but if you're looking for a good party movie, here's your go to film.I rather like breakout films, and I felt that this film rather brought the bar up for me! The effects are stunning, and it's well casted!Out of 10 tickets, I give it a 7.5 ticket stub!I didn't enjoy every last second, as special effects aren't really my ballpark, but I could look past it and enjoy it as a good breakout flick!",7,2,4,19 February 2013
Shaun of the Dead," Shaun Of The Dead: Buy it On Blu-Ray
","Edgar Wright's smash hit self proclaimed 'rom-zom-com,' is set in England during the midst of the zombie outbreak. During which, fumbling Shaun and company decide to wait the horrors out at a local pub, and decide to let things sort themselves out over a nice cool pint.Surprisingly, the film actually has a solid sense of motivation. Shaun is really just the wrong guy, at the wrong place, at the wrong time. While he is still horrified, he decides it is just what he needs to prove his worth to ex, Liz. As a huge horror fan myself, I was laughing like crazy in the film. Everyone is fleshed out as dimensional characters, who you're actually kind of sad to see die, and trust me when I say, that people die hard in this movie.As they come, Shaun Of The Dead is an amazing horror comedy. It's editing is fast and swift, the direction is a complement to the very foundation of film. It's hard not to say; You should totally Buy It On Blu-Ray",10,5,11,27 August 2013
28 Weeks Later," 28 Days Later
","In this genre explosion horror film, England is set in the midst of a zombie break out, following a group of activist's try to free specimen monkeys from lab experimentation, the Rage Virus is released. Transferable through saliva and blood, it turns it's victims in ravenous, hungry, feral beast. Now, 28 Days after the virus takes full scale effect, Jim, a bicycle delivery man, thrown into a coma after an accident, has missed the evac party, and is now stuck in the remains of England.I had been wanting to see this all weekend, and I now regret watching the film oso early in the morning. A film I was so eager to see did little to my expectations. Personally, I'm more of a Shaun of the Dead guy, but for the film's endurance, I managed to enjoy it. If you have friends in town, or you're at a party, this is a class act choice. But, I'm not a huge party goer, so it brings it down in some ways. I found it actually dull in scenes it needed power, and powerful when a scene needed to be slow. But, it being an amateur film, I give it a pass. Another thing that didn't drive me too crazy about the film, was that it was all shot in digital, being a bit more a film fan myself, it brought it down in some ways.But overall, it's a pretty decent film. But, not something I'll be watching again, too soon. If I do come around over it again, I'll at least watch Shaun of the Dead first, or after the film, because of this, I give 28 Days Later:A 6.5 Ticket Stub out of 10 tickets.",6,0,2,24 June 2013
Disturbia," Disturbia, a film worth a 10
","Disturbia is what I call a rip-make, you're not sure if it a remake or rip-off, none the less this movie was amazing!Disturbia is about Kale, a teenager who is placed under house-arrest after getting in a fight with his teacher. When the judge 'let's him off with a brake' he sentenced to house arrest, his mom cuts his X-Box live account and his ITunes account, then she cuts the TV cord, so he can think of something more creative.After a few days of boredom, he starts people watching on his neighbors, especially his next door neighbor Mr. Turner, who he suspects to be a serial killer.The whole movie is roller-coaster ride from there. It is funny and scary as hell!I give it a 10/10, best of all you're gonna love sober! Or if like watching horror movies drunk, who the hell cares!",10,0,1,8 August 2012
Kick-Ass," A Kick ass movie!
","Need I say what I said in the summary? Kick ass was funny and graphic as hell, the story main focused on a comic book fan Dave Lizewski who is tired of being bullied around and tired of thinking why people are not super hero's in real life. So he orders a suit online with some wooden batons (it is never revealed where he got them from) and goes out into the night to Kick some Ass!, and it ends up horribly! While on a run he meets 'Hit Girl' and 'Big Daddy' they team up only to face a dreaded fate against New York gang owner Frank D'Amico. This movie has the ending that you have to see for self! All in all the movie was really good the story was awesome and follow-able and the characters you can really care for! I recommend you leave the kids behind on this one, and if you love a good laugh what are you waiting for buy or rent Kick Ass today!",8,3,4,17 February 2012
Pulp Fiction," I can't describe the awesomeness!
","In Quentin Tarantino's all hit, nonlinear, cult classic, Pulp Fiction concerns three stories.Vincent Vega & Mia Wallace, The Golden Watch, and The Bonnie SituationFor those not aware, nonlinear means out of order, not in chronological order, out of place, and if anyone's got to do it, leave it to Tarantino and Roger Avary!This is the funniest, most well directed, well acted I have ever seen in my entire life! And I'm 13! For me, it's up there with Fight Club!My favorite story, all of them, as I'm a big nonlinear fan, I was able to piece it together!The script, no debate, next time I go to a fast food joint, I'm getting a Royale with Cheese!Out of 10 movie tickets, 10 tickets! NO DEBATE!",10,0,2,19 February 2013
Les Mis√©rables," Just wow....
","This movie had real potential, I mean it's Tom Hooper, the director of King's Speech! I always thought that the book was something for the screens, not the Bright Light Way, but this movie was as bad as the play!In an overall synopsis of the story, Jean Valjean has just skipped his bail, and is now covering his tracks as the manager of a sewing company. Employee Fantine is fired, and is forced into prostitution, to keep herself and new daughter alive. But after her death, Jean takes her daughter under his wing, at the same time, being pursued by officer Javert.Not one bit of talking! It is all song, dance, and no talking. The movie was enjoyable, but I somehow didn't appeal to it. I found it very slow at some points, and at others, too fast when it had to be slow. Now, I must rate the film, I sadly give the film a 6.5 ticket stub out of ten.",6,3,5,2 March 2013
The Wolf of Wall Street," The Wolf on Wall Street
","Based in the 1980's, The Wolf on Wall Street follows Jordan Belfort, a starting up stock broker in New York. When the firm he is working at crashes on Black Friday, he is thrown to the curb with almost nothing to survive on. When he applies for another job, he discovers the excellence made off of penny-stocks and from there, it is a roller coaster ride of adrenalin rushed cocaine fun.Now, understandably, there is controversy surrounding the film. Citing that is making awe-too good out of a horrible situation, that is emphasizing drug-usage and prostitution, and other sorts of illegal activity. Now, I must say in someway I agree with the controversy. Back when Django Unchained came out, I defended the film, in a post Sandy Hook environment, the filmmakers had absolutely no percussing knowledge of the tragedy, so I stood behind the film. But this is a film that I can say that they know of the situation, and they are glorifying it.So this is where things get touchy; are the emphasizing it to notify it, or to have fun with a bad situation. Now, you are more than welcome to see either which way. Personally, I'm kind of torn on which way the cookie crumbles. But, from the environment and tone that the film presented in it's nearly 3 hour run-time, I'd say both.I did in fact see this film as a parody of it and I mean a classic parody. Like Mel Brooks parody. What they did was they took a devastating situation and shined a different light on it.Now, with the cast involved, people would have come out of the theaters commenting they didn't seize the opportunity they had at hand, if it was looked upon from another, more serious view point. So, either which way, people are going to come out peeved off.The film is narrated and stars Leonardo Dicaprio, in one of the best roles he has to date. What the filmmakers do is a Ferris Bueller type of narration, in which he would notify the camera and actually talk to it.The film also has an amazing supporting cast, with Johnah Hill as Donnie Azoff, Jordan's right hand man through out most of the film, Kyle Chandler as an FBI agent on Jordan's tale through out the second and third act of the film, Rob Reiner in one the best comedic roles to this date, and a cameo of sorts from Matthew McConaughey. All of whom knock it straight of the park.The slightest nit pick I have is the way they took the narration though. In some scenes he's notifying the camera and in others, he was just doing it in his head. Another thing I would like to bring up is how self invested it got the drugs and sexual innuendo. Soon enough, it developed to the point that I was used to it, so that's something to say.But either which way, just focusing on it from a film viewers perspective, it's a 10/10.",10,3,10,2 January 2014
Scream," It's a Screamer!
","Wes Craven's cult classic horror film follows in the aftermath of two students grizzly murders. As the town mourns over their deaths, a group of high school seniors mourn in their own way, by relating them to the grandfather horror films of the past. Soon they become targets of the killer, and they must somehow survive the town if they wish to see a high school diploma, with no blood on it.This is the calling card to all film-buffs, all Easter eggs scattered through out the film are homages to it's origins, while at the same time maintaining it's own special place, for all film fan's hearts.Out of 10 movie tickets, it's a 9.5. The motive was so simple, and so well understood.",10,3,3,23 March 2013
Halloween," Halloween
","This has to be the best horror movie that I've ever had the pleasure of seeing!It is Halloween night 1963 Haddonfield, Illinois we first see the Myers house nighttime, we go to the window of the family room and a boy and girl are making out they then decide to go upstairs. The camera then enters the kitchen a boy in a clown costume grabs a butcher knife, and a clown mask left by the other boy. He goes into his sisters room and stabs her to death (not graphic, but blood is shown). The boy exits the house and his parents see him they boy Michael Myers. 15 years later Michael (Will Sadin as a child, Nick Castle as an adult) manages to break out of the mental hospital and return to Haddonfield and finish his long time goal, to kill his sister Laurie Stroode (Jamie Lee Curtis) as his doctor Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) chases him through the town. A top notch film in my opinion please rent it, I give Halloween and 8/10.",8,0,1,29 March 2012
Final Destination," Warning: if you had a near-death experience in the past few days, it's best mind of you, not to watch this!
","In this John Hughes movie gone to hell, a French Class en route for Paris for an end of the year trip is ill-fated by the unpreventable plane crash, which will kill all aboard. But few are sparred from the flight, after teenager Alex Browning has a premonition of the deadly flight. They rejoice in their luck, but soon, Death soon sets out to collect the souls who evaded their ending, now they must figure out how to evade his gruesome agenda. Inspired by an actual case, in which a Mother called her daughter, the day before her flight, saying that she had suffered a dream depicting the crash. Concerned for her mother, the daughter rescheduled her flight,and as fate would have it, the plane crashed shortly after takeoff. I like to think of this movie like The Twilight Zone movie, just a hell of a lot more bloody! The Hitchcockian feel to it adds more pleasure to the film's experience. I will admit, I rarely watch horror films, mainly because over time, they've become an overdone, generic work after another, when I do watch something that meets the term horror, it's usually psychological or a murder mystery, take for instance 'And Then There Were None'. But, sometimes I will build up the bravery to sit through them, and most of the time, I am pleased with what I see. Luckily, this was one of the films that I enjoyed! The best part of the film's franchise is the Rube Goldberg-esque death scenes, as the series progresses, these become more creatively done, in this feature, the most creative death was the one that took place at a restaurant. But this being the first film, I give it a pass! But, like most franchises,the greatness dies off. I've heard through recent reviews that the 5th installment was actually the best, all ignorance to the 4th chapter, which was said to be the dullest out of the series, agreeably amongst all fans and critics. But, I have yet to see 4 and 5, as I have only seen 1 -3, as I am not too much of a horror fan! Out of all the films, I have to say that this has the best acting, directing, and writing. I give the film an 8.5/10 ticket stub. The perfect Halloween film, just make sure for the love of God that there are no children in the room, and fare warning, if you had some near death experience in the past few days, this may not be of fare mind to you!",8,1,1,28 February 2013
Sin City," To have a city, you gotta have a little Sin!
","I am going to review this movie by segment:The Customer is Always Right (Part I) :The Businessman walks out onto the balcony of what appears to be a hotel, where a party is being held. He then meets The Customer, as they talk, he offers her a cigarette, as they continue to talk, she says that she's tired of running, they kiss, and as they do, he shoots her in the back.

He takes her with him to Kevin's farm, where he successfully manages to trap, and kill him. He then visits Roark, and after showing him Kevin's head, and soon kills the Cardinal.This one was interesting, as I am an avid vengeance fan, I will say I enjoyed it.The Big Fat KillThis one I absolutely hated! I am only giving the log-line. Dwight, the boyfriend of Shellie, agrees for some God knows what reason, to help hide the remains of a cop that was killed in the Red-light-district of Sin City, Old Town.This was the weakest one of all, I absolutely hated it as I never came across a proper motive for Dwight.The Yellow Bastard (Part II) After 8 years in the state prison after being framed, Haritgan makes his way out, believing that Nancy is in trouble. He tracks her down to a bar, where she has become an exotic dancer. As he begins to walk off, she follows him out, and they are pursued by a yellow man, who is later revealed to be Junior.

I give it 8 tickets out of 10!",8,0,1,17 February 2013
The Cabin in the Woods," Cabin In the Woods (2011)
","In this soon to be cult classic, a group of five college stereotypes head off to a deserted cabin located in the woods for a long weekend of relaxation. But, soon after arriving, they learn that they are there for a higher power.This movie was fantastic, when I first heard of it, it sounded very generic. But, looking back, all of my friends who recommended it to me were in the right place, as spoiling the film would tarnish the experience. What mainly interested me in the film, was the Joss Wheadon-isms to it, his trademark writing is what makes the film so much better for what is, and what it should be, a great horror film for future generations.The ending is best not spoiled, but once you learn it, your respect for horror will be completely rebirthed.I give the film a 10.5 ticket stub, happily I might add!",10,1,4,20 March 2013
The Island," A great sci-fy film and a really good script!

It was creative and well written, I have to be honest, Skyline completely killed my faith in the sci-fy world, but when I ever I look this over, I am happy with the genre again!Michael Bay is a director who hasn't been recognized the way he should be, this movie saddens me because of that fact!I give the film an 8.5 ticket stub, it's a great film for the perfect party!",8,0,0,19 February 2013
