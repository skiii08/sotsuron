10 Cloverfield Lane," Brilliant as the first
","I loved this. As I loved Cloverfield. Both films take a very convention film idea, and twist it around so it's done in an all new and brilliant way. It's hard writing a review about a film like this, without giving too much away. It's the sort of film you should go into, and know almost nothing about. To get the full effect. I will say John Goodman is in it. And he is as amazing as ever. I will say that if you've seen Cloverfield, and you're expecting a similar film. Then you will be surprised. My recommendation is to cosy up with some nibbles. Switch the lights off. And watch this. Don't sit reading anything more about it. Just get into it, and enjoy the ride.",8,1,2,20 August 2016
Rise of the Guardians," kids really enjoyed it. but would we watch it again?
","I heard when this one bombed it nearly took dream works with it. It's not that bad. It's quite enjoyable. I assume it was just bad timing when it was released. It was up against the likes Brave and Wreck It Ralph that year. Which are all time classics in my house. Give it a go. My kids 6 and 9 were hooked all the way through. It's not a classic. But it's more fun than The Good Dinosaur. Even though the film features Santa, it's not specifically a Christmas movie. At times it kind of feels like you're watching cut scenes from a kids computer game. But another good solid kids film from the company. I've seen people saying it's the best film ever. That seems a bit extreme. I suppose it all depends on your taste.",6,2,4,16 August 2016
X-Men: First Class," Wow
","I avoided this for years s. Thinking it was going to be naff. But no. It's great fun!! It's got a cool 60s bond vibe. Fassbender is going all out bond in this. Jennifer Lawrence is adorable! Emma Frost is like a later day Farrah Fawcett It's measured. It's well paced. It's cool. It's sexy It's almost as good as the first X Men film. It just lacks good old Wolverine. But the performances here are great. If like me, you had your doubts, forget them. Sit back and enjoy this. We need more 60s themed super hero movies lol.I'm looking forward to watching the sequel already. It's reaffirmed my love of X-Men films. After the Wolverine movies ruined them a bit.",8,2,2,29 August 2016
