The Incredible Hulk," Wow!!! the film the first wished it was!!! brilliant
","I have just got back from watching Incredible Hulk and just had to write about it. After finding out that Louis Leterrier was directing the film I new that this film would be a lot better than the first. He produces some amazing action sequences such as Transporter and Unleashed. He also has a brilliant eye for where the camera should and gets some brilliant shots in the film.I was also very impressed with the acting. Edward Norton, Tim Roth and Liv Tyler give brilliant performances as the leading cast members. I had doubts over Edward Norton but he really does give a brilliant performance and proves that he was the right man to play the Hulk. I thought the way Tim Roth played his character was very good.People were saying the Hulk CGI was rubbish but when they watch this on the big screen thy will see how good it really looks. The Hulk in the first one was good but this one was a lot better. It just looked more realistic, showing stretch marks of the skins and all the veins popping out of him. Abomination was also very well made from CGI. It looked brilliant with all the bones sticking out his back. Made him look more menacing.The action sequences of the film were amazing. Although there was only three, they lasted a long time and produced brilliant action. The part where they trap Hulk at the university was really good. Just how Hulk should be smashing things all over the place and causing havoc. But the end action sequence was amazing. At first i thought people were over exaggerating that it was 20 minutes long but they really weren't. It did last that long. It's how the last film should of ended with cars being thrown all the over the place and building get destroyed. Abomination and Hulk really do cause havoc.Overall this is far better than the first one and should not put you off this one. It is loads better. You will love the action sequences and the action from the main cast members. This is defiantly one of the best comic book film made and the most enjoyable. You will love this film even if aren't to keen the the comics. Go see it. you won't be disappointed.",10,5,11,12 June 2008
Hot Fuzz," British comedy at it's best
","OMG this movie is so good. I haven't laughed out loud in a cinema in ages and i was doing it all the time. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are such a great partnership. As like Shaun Of The Dead it produces some hilarious scenes. That film really made me want to go and see Hot Fuzz and I definitely wasn't disappointed at all. I have looked at some of the voting and i really can't believe that some people have marked it 1, 2 , 3 and 4 out of 10. There is no way in a millions years it is worth that. It also has some great British actors in there as well like Timothy Dalton, Steve Coogan, Bill Nighly, Paddy Considine and many more. This film really is as good as it's sounds so trust me go and see it.",10,1,3,17 February 2007
Aliens," Easily the best of all the aliens
","When I first watched Alien i was really impressed and had to get Aliens. I wasn't sure if this could be as good because most sequels hardly ever surpass the first. But I thought this was a lot better. Don't get me wrong the first was brilliant but this was amazing. Everything was right. They had a brilliant cast, brilliant story, brilliant effects and brilliant acting.The thing i was most impressed about was the design of it all. It looked amazing. They Made things look realistic and the aliens looked really good as well. The aliens home was put together brilliantly. For a 1986 film they made the effects look really good and the set. The king alien looked very good and the set of it's home was very good as well. Yet again Sigourney Weaver puts on a brilliant performance as like she did in the first one and Jennette Goldstien as Pvt Vaquez gave a great performance and is one of the best movie heroes ever.With the first film it had a lot of parts that made you jump and had you on the edge of your seat. It was exactly the same with this one. There were lots of parts that made you jump and nearly the whole film had you on the edge of your seat wanting to know what was going to happened next and they had a lot more gore in this than the first which was good to see because i thought in the first it would be fairly gory but it weren't that much.If you thought the first was good you must watch this. You will be blown away by the effects and design and the great action sequences they have with the aliens. It is one of the best films made and it will keep you entertained from start to finish.",10,27,45,24 February 2008
Alien vs. Predator," Humans vs Aleins and Pedators
","This film is nothing like the game. I mean they call is Alien vs Predator but it's not. There is only one proper fight between aliens and predators. I mean don't get me wrong it is a wicked fight but it is a shame that they didn't do more than one. In the Game it is none stop fighting. In the end it is just killing the humans. I suppose we new that would happen but the whole idea of the film is to see the Alien and Predators kill each other.I thought it was stupid when Alexa befriends one of the predators. The only positive things i can really give about this film is that the CGI is really good, the fighting sequences are good and the story is OK. If you love the game and are expecting to be non stop fighting between the aliens and predators then you will be disappointed but if you haven't played the game and don't know what to expect you will probably like it.",5,0,0,7 February 2008
Batman Begins," Easily the best comic book to film movie
","This is defiantly better than the old batman films. They were good but just lacked the action and acting. The new batman brings a new look to batman. I think Christian Bale plays batman really well and he is a lot better than previous batman such as George Clooney, Val Kilmer. Micheal Keaton was the best one from the previous batman. The action sequences from batman were very entertaining, especially the car chase in the new bat mo-Bil and thought they did a good job the car. The story was brilliant because it showed us a new villain those that didn't read the comics or watch the cartoon. Cillian Murphy played the scarecrow very well and i'm sure scared a few people with his performance. This movie is very entertaining and i'm sure everyone will be glad to see batman back at it's best and good too see they have found the right actor for the role of batman.I am defiantly looking forward to the Dark Night hitting the cinema June 2008.",10,1,2,11 May 2007
Ghost Rider," The only thing worth watching is the visual effects
","This wasn't a film i really, really wanted to see, i just wanted to see it because my friend told me it is really good. But i really wish i hadn't of listened to him. I thought it was awful. The only thing that was good about it was the visual effects which is brilliant, but apart from that it was crap. The action sequences were really short and weren't that brilliant anyway. The film was just going know where. For me it was just about ghost rider trying to stop Blackheart from possessing one thousand evil souls on to the earth and thats it. If i was you i wouldn't waste your money on this at all. Even if you were a fan of ghost rider fan i think you will be very disappointed. If you are looking for film to make go 'wow thats was brilliant' look some where else because this is no where near that mark.",3,1,3,24 February 2008
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Not great but better than the first
",The first fantastic four was OK but this 1 was a lot better. Although it were great it was better than the first. You saw more action than you did in the last one and you got to see the fantastic four use their powers more. The CGI was brilliant and made the end fight scene look brilliant. I think for this one they wanted to focus more on the action rather than story telling because in the it was mainly all about that and not much action to see which was fairly disappointing but this one made up for it with the action. I didn't think Jessica Abla was very good playing her role as the invisible women just like the first one. Also in the film it was quite funny at times just like the first one. I thought the script wasn't to good and they could of done better with that.I thought this film was enjoyable to watch. my expectations weren't really running high but it was very enjoyable. If you like the first one and are a fan of fantastic four there i'm sure you will enjoy this. But if you didn't like the first you will probably not like this.,7,1,2,24 February 2008
Avatar," Another movie spectacular by James Cameron
","When I first heard about this film I was looking forward to it a lot but I must admit when I saw the trailer it didn't really do it for me. It wasn't what I thought it would look like. But as I like every other James Cameron film I thought I would check it out and I must say it is spectacular. I didn't think I would like but it is one of the best films I have ever seen.The visual effects are just amazing. There is no other word to describe it. Pandora actually felt like it was real. It was that good. The attention to detail was brilliant. It just looked so realistic, visually stunning. The scene where Jake learns how to fly looked amazing. The dragon like creatures looked very real and were very well designed. I loved it when Jake and Neytiri were racing down the side of the mountain. The camera angle they got on that was brilliant.The last 30 minutes of the film was just breathtaking. I mean it was all systems go. It was non stop action the whole way. James done a great job of putting that together. It was just so well done. They had some great moments when it went slow motion. That was brilliant. It was just so mad with all helicopters and the navi in the air taking each other out.Colonel Miles who was played by Stephen Lang was the best character for me. He played him so well that he really made you hate him because he was just so brutal. He just didn't really care about anyone. He just pretty much wanted everyone dead. The look of his character was spot on, making him big and mean and having those scars across his face.Also the navi looked really good. I mean loads of people were saying they looked rubbish in the trailer but on the big screen they looked amazing. It was just amazing how they got the facial expression looking so good. I mean when Jake jumped in the lake when he was being chased it looked so real when the water was dripping from his face.James Cameron can definitely be happy with this film. He just never disappoints. Some of his camera angles were brilliant. They were just so clever. I mean the end battle must have taken him ages to film, let alone edit. This film is definitely one was best films I have ever seen and gets me really excited to see what the film industry could be like in a few years to come with technology like this. It is so entertaining and will have you glued to the screen throughout the whole film and wanting to see what Cameron can come up with next. I can't wait to see what the sequel will be like.",10,40,66,17 December 2009
Casino Royale," James bond is still at it's best
","I don't know why everyone was saying Daniel Craig won't be good because everyone that has said that are so badly gonna be proved wrong when they see this. It is 1 of the best James bonds. The action sequences in it are really entertaining especially at the beginning. The part in the casino is good to watch as well but really the whole film is great to watch. For all you people saying it's rubbish and Daniel Craig is crap what are u on, did you actually watch the movie? Daniel Craigs acting in it is really good to which a lot of people were saying it would be bad. I am very sure that the next James Bond is going to be just as good.",10,2,4,19 November 2006
Live Free or Die Hard," Now this is what i call a proper action film
","Having loved all the die hard films I wasn't sure if this was going to be anygood. It had to be amazing to be like the others......and it was brilliant. From start to finish it was non-stop action. The stunts and action sequences were brilliant and some of them left me on the edge of my seat. In most action films you will have most action sequences wrecked by CGI e.g The Marine. Nearly all action Sequences, they used CGI which just spoiled it. I am glad Die Hard 4 didn't do that. I mean the part where the police car flies into the helicopter was unreal. Most people thought that was CGI but no they actually did that. The part at the end with the jet destroying the bridge was brilliant. Timothy Olyphant play a great villain and i am looking forward to seeing him in his new film Hit-man. Justin long plays his character really well as does the rest of the cast. Over all this is a fun filled action packed fananza which will keep you hooked till the end.",10,1,5,22 July 2007
