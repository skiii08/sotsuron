Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Above Average, but disappoints
","After being such a big Star Wars fan, and I know I am. So just because I didn't like this movie as much as the original 3. Doesn't mean that I am not a real star wars fan. I just think it could of been done a lot better. I think the problem with this movie is that it is too 'kiddish' and there isn't a lot of depth in the characters as the original 3. Ok I'll split this review up into Highs and Lows.Highs 1. Clearly the lightsaber duels, these were fantastic, best out of all the star wars movies by far. Made the movie a bit better.2. Well the special effects were great. Very realistic.3.Liam Neeson, I thought did a great job acting. I also thought Ian McDiarmid did a great job as well.4. Pod race was well done, entertaining to watch.5. Watto, I liked him..interesting character and fun to watch.6. Duel Of The Fates and Anakin's Theme were great bits of music. Lows1. Darth Maul, he looks great, fights great but NO depth in his character at all. Was hardly in the movie and I thought that was a real downfall.2. Jar Jar Binks, what a silly character and could anyone actually understand what he was saying? George Lucas what were u thinking?3. I think having Anakin Skywalker as a 9 year old was a mistake. It really made it feel like a 8 year old movie. Jake Lloyd was annoying at times. But he is only a kid and I think it's hard for a kid to be a good actor.Natalie Portman I didn't think did a good job, showed no emotion at all really.4. Lets face it the storyline wasn't that good. Pretty boring at times.5. Obi-Wan - not having a go at Ewan, but where was the character depth there? Very bad script writing.6. The ending sucked, with Anakin blowing up the trade Federation ship, by the way where did all the federation ships go anyway? The Celebration at then end, seen it all before sorry. Should of ended the movie when Yoda and Mace Windu were wondering about the sith.7. Some of the lines were terrible. Like When Anakin's mum said 'He was meant to help you' and when they were heading back for Naboo and jar jar goes 'we are going home'..one of the few times I understood him.I'm not saying this movie is a  disaster, it's still a good movie, but it is the worst out of the 4. To be fair it is the first episode and it is meant to be an introduction to the characters and so forth, but in a few ways you cant help and feel a little disappointed. Another thing that didn't help it, was the huge hype. No film could live up to the hype TPM got. If you haven't seen it, have a look at it and enjoy it. But it ain't in the Class of TESB or Star Wars. 3 out of 5 stars.",7,0,1,20 November 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Very Good, but not great
","When I was about 10, I use to think that ROTJ was the best movie of all time, why was that? Cos I thought the last 40 minutes or so was so cool. But 9 year later my option is a lot different. 40 minutes does not make a movie. I still am not 100% sure why I do not like ROTJ as much as the other 2 (not including TPM). There is just something missing. Maybe it's the Ewoks that were just in it for merchandising and I think that did let the film down a bit. Like you go from Empire which is really dark to teddy bears running around killing stormtroopers. Sorry, but it's too unbelievable. Another thing I haven't understood is the Space Battle. When The Rebels come out of Hyperspace I reckon there's probably about 15 capital ships at most. Ok yeah they blew the death star up again (something new would of been good) but Surely the Empires fleet could wipe out the small rebel fleet after the death star was destroyed. Then as the falcon has blown up the death star u see about 30 rebel capital ships flying away from it...sorry if u think I am being picky but there are a lot of flaws here. I can understand if people get bored of the movie for awhile. It starts of slow and after killing jabba too the last 40 minutes it's quite slow. Oh the last one is finding out Luke and Leia are brother and sister. And straight away you think of them sharing a kiss in Empire. Plus there was a more passionate kiss cut out as well (thankgod). The acting wasn't the best, I think Mark Hamill tried too hard, and Harrison Ford seemed really uncomfortable at times and was nowhere near as good as in Empire (maybe it was being around the ewoks) On the positive sides though, there are some extremely good battle scenes. I thing some scenes were well written where Luke told Leia he was her brother and then straight after that with Vader talking to Luke. I guess it's a little bit of a let down from the other 2. You just expect a better ending and justifying. Although the special edition ending was a lot better then the original. With a lot better music to end it then that silly ewok song. In the end I'd give it 3 1/2 stars out of 5.",9,1,2,19 November 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Excellent movie
","Star Wars is and excellent movie without a doubt. I think it's the 2nd best out of the 4 Star Wars movies. Although the plot maybe kind of old by now. It changed the way we saw movies over 20 years ago, I still wonder sometimes that people might only think it's great because of the special effects. Maybe not us interesting as TESB, but without a doubt a great movie. It has an excellent soundtrack. Listen too the bit where Luke looks at the Sunset on Tatooine. Although I am disappointed that the Biggs Darklighter scenes were cut. After viewing them on the behind the magic cd. I think it would of added a bit more of a human touch too it. I think the Special edition scenes were ok. But the scene where Greedo shoots at Han is just silly. How can a bounty hunter miss from a metre away. It might seem like I am being very negative with this movie, but there just little things I think would of made the movie just that little bit better. Star Wars shows us new worlds, different aliens, technology and it's really interesting too watch. If anybody has not seen Star Wars, I strongly recommend it. 5/5 Stars but not as good as Empire.",10,0,0,19 November 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," My favourite movie
","I used to think that Return Of The Jedi was the best out of the original 3, and The Empire Strikes Back was the worst, but that was when I was a kid. Since then, I have grown up a bit more now and watched the 3 all over again. I now believe that Empire is clearly the best of the 3. Why is that? Because of the following things. 1. Best Plot out of the three and it shows you that it doesn't all come down to special effects. 2. The movie is very dark, revealing and more importantly it's realistic that the bad guys actually win.Like how many movies out there do u see the bad guys win? The trouble with other movies is they are so predictable in that you know what will happen. In Empire you don't. 3. Best acting by the cast out of the three. 4. The soundtrack, the best music score I have ever heard. It adds a lot to the movie. 5. Irvin Kershner did a fantastic job of directing, I wish George Lucas brought him back for episodes 2 and 3. The scenes with Luke in the cave was Brilliant. The Battle Of Hoth was great, but I really enjoyed the scenes on Dagobah with Yoda and Luke. Yoda telling us about the force and the brilliant ending. This movies is 5/5 stars and my favourite movie off all time In conclusion I wish George Lucas would watch TESB again and realise the prequels should be done the way empire was done. The Phantom Menace was above average but it is nowhere near as good as Empire and the WORST out of the 4.",10,0,0,22 November 1999
