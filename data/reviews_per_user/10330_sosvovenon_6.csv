Resident Evil: Afterlife," Should I have known? Probably...
","Sixty million dollars. This is more money than 99.99% of the world's population will ever see in their lives, probably. And the producers don't even take the time to look at the episode in the 'saga' that came before... Apparently this film is supposed to be a sequel to the last Resident Evil movie, and some things appear to build on that story... But if you look at 'Resident Evil: Extinction' (much to the horror of the producers, some people may actually REMEMBER that one) especially the beginning of that movie, you will see that the people who made this boring and unoriginal sequel hold nothing but contempt for their audience.I see it now... How this all came into being...PRODUCER: We should open with... (takes drag from suspicious cigarette) a scene where Alice is flipping and flopping and taking out guards in swat gear. All in slow motion! And you should see pillars... Yeah; pillars at the end, all shot to pieces. Wow, I hope this place isn't bugged, because all this is so original someone might steal it.DIRECTOR: I think that scene is from Matrix.PRODUCER: And the bullets she shoots should make like, uhm... Cool traces in the air. In slow motion.DIRECTOR: That may also be from Matrix. Look, why don't we take a couple of thousand and hire a script writer? PRODUCER: What are you talking about? I'm having a stroke of genius right now! There should also be a mall, no a prison, or something, that is all surrounded by zombies... And the zombies are trying to get in.DIRECTOR: That may be from Dawn of the Dead.PRODUCER: What are you talking about you curmudgeon? This is all original thought right here! We don't need any script. Just take all this I'm saying and wing it... David Lynch never needs a script... Like, we should have this scene on a roof. And there are lots of zombies. And Milla, she catches a machine gun that is thrown to her. In slow motion.DIRECTOR: Why!? PRODUCER: Because can you think of anything cooler than Milla Jovovich catching a machine gun in slow motion? DIRECTOR: (Sighs deeply) Maybe a huge zombie with a giant axe? PRODUCER: You know I just thought of something.DIRECTOR: What? PRODUCER: You know I'm just free-wheeling right now. Shooting from the hip. Swimming with the flow. I'm just thinking, stop me if I'm out on a limb right now. I see a zombie. It MAY be really huge. Perhaps, just perhaps its within the realm of possibility... If it doesn't hurt the suspension of disbelief... that it has a giant axe. You have to put that in the film. That's it. A huge zombie with a giant axe. I think we've nailed it.DIRECTOR: Also we could perhaps make it like a in-house joke that Milla has ammo clips that never run out? PRODUCER: Nah. I don't like cynical references like that. Maybe we can just assume that the bullets in the clips are really, really small so a lot of them fit in there. Only you don't see that. Because the clips themselves are sort of opaque, so you CAN'T see through the metal.",3,2,5,8 November 2010
Underworld Awakening," Seven out of ten?!
","My left eye almost popped out of its socket when I saw this film got seven stars out of ten on IMDb. Then my right eye almost popped out when I read how much money they spent on making this movie. You can certainly tell they spent a lot of money... But you can't polish a turd with dollar bills. The main problems are the poor script and the lame, tired visual ideas. It makes you wonder if the good actors in this film actually read the script before accepting the part. Either the didn't, which is a bit strange... Or they did - and that is mind boggling. Why agree to star in a film with such an obviously inept script? Oh and some of the ideas/visuals... 'We have a lethal vampire loose in our secret lab! At once turn on the confusing, strobing lights that trigger epilepsy! What? Why we should do this!? I don't know - I've seen in movies they have those in their secret superlabs so I thought we should install our own... Kinda cool, huh?' Amazingly, the film-makers seem unable to shake their obsession with strobing, flickering lights - they appear for no apparent reason in several scenes. The werewolves look stupid a cliché - like a really poor horror slasher film. Which this is, sort of. The facepalm moments... Like when vampire girl wakes up in secret lab (the one with the STROBING LIGHTS remember) and finds her latex suit and all her gear in a nice cupboard with a glass door right next to the bed... Wait... Its almost like the writer couldn't come up with something better... Or the script is written by a nine year old... One would have though it safer to keep the evil super vampire's belongings locked up in a safe place far away from where she might wake up any moment... A true facepalm moment. Of which there are many in this snore-fest of a film. I struggle to actually remember the story. Several times I felt a horrible urge to fast forward or walk out. The only things I clearly remember about this film are the cringeworthy story solutions and how forgettable it is. For the latter I should perhaps grateful.",2,6,10,17 February 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," A Poor Film
","First of all, let me give you a short anecdote of what happened to me while I was watching this movie in the theater.At first, after putting on my 3D glasses, the opening credits looked as though I was staring cross-eyed at some sickening troll picture on the internet. I really started feeling a little bit uneasy, and frankly -- sick to the stomach. Next, I started to adjust a tiny bit to the 3D. The audio was just on the verge of being ear-splitting at times, adding to my discomfort. Then, the frame rate hit in. A few parts of the scenes in the first 45 or so minutes looked like a ridiculous silent movie from the 1920's. To me, the action scenes consisted of up to 80% of inexplicable confused ghost closeups of something that I suppose was dwarfs being double projected onto my retinas. This also filled my body up with an emotion that can only be described as mild to moderate angst. In one scene a loud snoring sound appeared, panned far to the right. This was when I was just aching for the movie to end. My hind quarters were hurting pretty bad. I thought that a member of the audience had actually fallen asleep, which wouldn't have surprised me in the least by that point. But it turned out to be just one of the goblins snoring! Great unintentional humor there! I would like to address Mr. Jackson directly now. I want to tell you that watching this movie was a rather excruciating experience. I got quite physically nauseated by the horridness of the 3D effects that I experienced, and the sometimes inexplicable effects of the high frame rate. I don't go to the movies to feel physically and mentally anguished. I would very much like it if you payed me an amount of money that represents what it cost my mother to actually take me to your movie just to cement our family relations during the important 'mellandagarna' Holiday in Sweden, plus a sum that represents a decent wage for three hours of work in your country. The money for the ticket will be used to reimburse my mother for her expense. The rest of the money will go to me personally to compensate for my loss of time while watching your film. Bear in mind Mr. Jackson -- the above is not (except for a couple of somewhat bitter comments) my opinion of your film, or a review of it. Its what actually happened to me while the film was being shown in the theater. If you would like to the decent and humane thing, please PM me on IMDb!Now we come to that difficult and sad part when I have to review this movie. It is tempting to make this the 'best of' compilation of the already excellent dumps several people have taken on this film, at this site. But I must rake my brain and make a (somewhat) original submit. (After all we all had to sit through the same film). Regrettably, it has to begin with the characters. Radagast: An embarrassing role that has bird manure caked in his beard. I cringed inside every time I was exposed to this poor representation of the brown wizard, which was actually a welcome relief from the nausea from the 3D. Galadriel: What can I say. Cate Blanchett is a good actress, but in this rendition of her previous part she provokes in me a slight feeling of wanting to get up from your movie seat and leave. Maybe its the way she turns so dreamily... Gandalf: Just bland. The Dwarfs: oh my Goodness... That (those) was (were)(some)(an) embarrassing performance(s)! Someone wrote that they reminded them of Jar-Jar Binks from the first Star Wars prequel. That is so spot on! Elrond: One of the few redeeming interpretations, but the part when they circle around the dwarfs with the horses sent messages to my legs to just get up and walk out of the theater. Bilbo: yeah... Real interesting. The rest of the characters: I hardly remember them because of the lingering nausea. (On a side-note: the reason this film gets a 3 from me and not a 1 is the fact that the beginning description of the Lonely Mountain and Thorin's acceptance of Bilbo actually provoked something slightly resembling true pangs of emotion in me). The Script: Obviously created by the same Peter Jackson Splinter Mind that wrote the 'Deadmen Nuke' part of 'Return of the King'. Really liked the snot humor, and so on! Nearly wet my pants spilling my drink on my pants to get out of the theater there, with a valid excuse for leaving (I wet my pants). I'm not even going to describe the rest of my feelings for this film. All I'm going to say is this: In 2014 get ready for 'Attack of the Clone Wars: The Quickening, part 2: Bilbo goes through a forest to a mountain, and that will take 6 hours!!!!'",3,4,15,28 December 2012
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Disturbing in the wrong way.
","I think we'll have to invent a new word for this movie. Holocaustsploitation, perhaps. The problem with this film is that it takes one of the most awful sets of events in human history and turns them into some kind of daytime movie for children and stay at home moms who like a good cry now and then. There's nothing wrong with being a kid or a housewife. But the holocaust really happened, you see.I can just imagine Ellen or Oprah promoting this film in their mildly sociopath style, becoming just perfectly tear-filled in a perfectly calculated way and then everyone in the audience gets a copy of this film on DVD.This movie has a strangely inauthentic feel to it and according to all documentary sources I have witnessed, it also IS very inauthentic. I think you cross a line when you set a film in and near an 'Auschwitz-y kind of concentration camp' and then decide to make some things really authentic (like Zyklon-B crystals being blue, for instance) and some things, like the camp perimeter, sort of what you need them to be to make a fictitious story work. In fact some revisionist would probably love this picture, because it turns concentration camps into a fairytale.I also found this film strangely unmoving. I don't know if its the music, the acting or the camera work, but it didn't really touch me in the slightest way. I found it mildly pleasant and entertaining to watch, which is completely wrong, when you think about it.If you want to see a truly great movie about the Holocaust, you should watch 'The Grey Zone'. This is a deeply disturbing and chilling piece that portrays the stark and utter horror of Auschwitz like it should be portrayed. Its not a good cry. It doesn't provide any answers. Instead it rips something out. It leaves you feeling cold, numb and terrified. Sure, The Grey Zone has its flaws, like some strange casting and inconsistent acting, but its not a borderline debacle like this one.",3,7,13,29 November 2010
How to Train Your Dragon," As a Swede I am mildly offended.
","If you were a Native American, wouldn't you get annoyed by a movie, in which the supposed 'Indians' looked like Maori and spoke with a German accent? The 'vikings' in this film are a disaster. Vikings DID NOT have horned helmets. If they spoke with an accent, it was NOT Scottish. The vikings in the film wear clothes and armor that is completely unlike anything a real viking would wear. I know this is a child movie-- but why not put at least a fragment of effort into making the 'vikings' appear at least a little viking-y? This all becomes extra irritating when the supposed vikings make references to actual Norse gods like Odin and use the ancient Norse alphabet. (Ancient rune-stones with such writing can be found not far from where I live.) As the 'vikings' in the film look and act like... well, nothing at all (except they have Scot accents), to be frank, why put these references to actual Norse culture in at all? This just makes it even more irritating. The people who made this film could have checked out 'Hrafninn flýgur' for instance to get a little bit into the viking feel... But apparently even checking vikings out on Wikipedia is too much of an effort... I wouldn't let my kids watch this movie, because I wouldn't want them to get the impression that our forebears looked and acted like dwarfs from World of Warcraft. Yeah, its a fantasy movie. But vikings actually existed... Another detail that annoyed me was the fact that the adults spoke with a Scot accent, and the kids spoke like Americans. The story is also stereotyped, a predictable 'from zero to hero' story that even a young child could predict with unerring accuracy. The makers of this film have seriously underestimated children, I think. This movie is not a complete disaster-- it has its moments. But awesome animation and a charming character (yes, the black dragon) doesn't make for a movie anymore.",4,19,64,24 October 2010
Cloud Atlas," Dune 2, or Battlefield: Earth 2?
","While watching this, for some reason I began thinking about the time I watched the film 'Dune' together with my father. For some reason, this movie has a 'cult following'. In the scene when Paul Atriedes rides on a sand worm, we almost fell out of our seats laughing, because it just looked so silly and stupid. But I should have cried. Dune is one of the best sci-fi novels I've ever read, but the movie is very poor. I imagine it was very expensive to make - just like Cloud Atlas. '$100 000 000 (estimated)' Yes - one hundred million dollars. Money that could have been used for cancer research, or something similar. Instead, they elected to invest this mind boggling sum in a horrible film. Natalie Portman gave the book to someone. She should have kept it for herself. In the opening scene we see Tom Hanks in old makeup. One of the cardinal sins of movie making - OLD MAKEUP. After sitting through this garbage, I got to see 'old' Halle Berry saying something like 'warm them old bones' in a faux old woman voice. Wow... Just - wow.",3,1,5,21 February 2013
