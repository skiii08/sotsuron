Walk the Line," A dreary, disappointing movie
","I had read the reviews, from friends as well as the papers and the Oscar hype and was looking forward to seeing this. Good performances go a very long way to determining my enjoyment of a movie and Joaquin Phoenix and especially Reese Witherspoon did good jobs. But the movie failed to engage me, or the 3 others I went with. Perhaps you need to be a Johnny Cash fan, the tedious songs that we had to endure throughout didn't help. He came across as a miserable character whose life wasn't really all that interesting in the end, or at least the script didn't make it so. Annoying inconsistencies were the casting of young Johnny with a perfectly normal face but Joaquin Phoenix of course has a cleft palate scar. His parents didn't seem to age at all over the 20 or so years the movie spanned. All in all I thought it highly overrated.",4,3,8,22 February 2006
Pride & Prejudice," Not a patch on the miniseries
","The characters in this adaptation seemed watered down versions of those in the miniseries. Both Matthew Mcfayden and Keira Knightly lacked the passion that Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle shared in the 1995 version. Jennifer Ehle had a sparkle in her eye and quiet passion that I missed in Keira Knightly's performance and where Colin Firth had a simmering, sexy reserve, Matthew Mcfayden just looked plain miserable. That there was not even a kiss between them made the whole affair a bit of an anticlimax too.Another disappointment was Mr Collins, who acted very well but lacked the ingratiating flourishes and sheer repulsiveness of David Bamber's Collins. The general feeling of the film was dull and miserable as opposed to lively and exciting, the relationship between Kitty and Wickham also hurried and confused. Judi Dench was very good as Lady Catherine but the plot failed to allow Elizabeth to win her grudging respect in the end as she does in the miniseries.",4,5,11,12 March 2006
