United 93," They Were Heroes.
","when i saw this movie,it touched me in so many ways.We all should learn something about the braveness of those people.This movie is one of the Best in movie history,Paul Greengrass's Direction is like straight from heaven and the cast is full with grate promise and they all are likely to succeed.I gave this movie 10/10 because i have never ever felt anything like the feeling that i felt when i watched this.I just hope this movie will be in at least two categories at the Oscars.BEST MOVIE. BEST DIRECTION.This is truly the best movie this year,maybe the best movie of all time.",10,2,4,25 December 2006
Hotel Rwanda," A movie that will change the world
",I watched this movie two days ago and its still stuck on my mind...Its a perfect story from the troubles of Africa. Not all grate movies have grate actors..unlike the hotel Rwanda it has charismatic actors and its really close the truth of the massacres of Rwanda...Don Cheadle makes His character a true hero and he should have won the Oscar. Hes performance Brings sympathy to the role of the brave hotel leader! My opinion from the movie is VERY positive and i hope that it will make a change to this dark world and bring a bright light and make people notice that Africa is really a poor and unstable land. So GO SEE THIS ONE! (i promise that you wont be disappointed),10,0,0,5 March 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," That little miss Breslin!
","I really loved this movie, because of the funny, witty but also serious performance of Abigail Breslin. Also I have to give credit to mister Alan Arkin and Toni Collette who are grate too! Its amazing script makes it even better, i cannot describe it! It's absolutely the best film of 2006 with United 93.It actually is all the things you really need from a comedy, its Funny,Heartwarming,Anti-Chlishe and also with a little depth in it..I absolutely recommend it to everyone, everywhere,all over the world!!! Oh! and finally i want to give credit to Steve Carrel, his just amazing in this also, bringing humor to his suicide attempt and finding self-respect to his character.",10,0,1,18 April 2007
