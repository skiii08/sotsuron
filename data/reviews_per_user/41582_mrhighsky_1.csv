Iron Man 3," Worst Marvel movie ever.
","I never thought that I would say this for a marvel movie, but I cant find any other words except to say that it was 'worst' marvel movie ever. From the first trailer I had big expectations for the movie but I was left very disappointed after watching it. This movie doesn't look like an Iron Man or a Marvel movie. It's a 'scary movie' type of thing with just Iron Man on focus. Previously I thought that 'Alien 3' is the worst sequel to any franchise but now my opinion is changed. 'Iron Man 3' is the worst ever. At the end I would say just one thing, 'Don't believe in the trailer. You will have a totally different experience in the movie'",3,0,4,8 September 2013
