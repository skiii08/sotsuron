The Blair Witch Project," I don't get it.
","I really don't get it.  I took my wife to see this film and she wanted to go home after the first half hour, I had to fight with her to stay and watch it.  I could see how the idea of being lost in the woods without being able to get out would be bad.  But I hated everyone in the movie so bad that I could not wait for them all to get snuffed.  The only thing I could think of is that this movie is for younger people who could relate to these people. I have never thought of good movies only being for young or older people, but I really don't get this one.  If anyone could explain why some people love this movie I would really like to know.",1,2,4,5 April 2000
Changeling," Interesting period piece
","Watching this film is like taking a look back in time. Everything is picture perfect, the beautiful automobiles, the red electric street cars, the telephones, the switchboard station with roller-skating supervisors, the house appliances, and the outstanding clothing, from dresses to hats to police uniforms, everything is meticulously detailed. The story, which we are told is true, is complex and multifaceted. Angelina Jolie, who plays Christine Collins, gives an outstanding performance as a single mother who returns home from work to find that her son is missing. This puts into motion a series of events that exposes the reality of what Los Angeles society was really like in the late 1920's. Corrupt Police, uncaring and self absorbed mental health professionals and the basic premise that people left to their own ambitions will do anything to secure their own prosperity. Although this paints a bleak picture of the human condition, the film show that the actions of a few good men can make a world of difference, John Malkovich as Reverend Gustav Briegleb, is determined to expose the corrupt Police in his radio talk show, Michael Kelly as detective Lester Ybarra, although hampered by his superiors, uncovers what really happened to the boy and the unlikely hero, a powerful attorney who takes her case pro-bono comes to her rescue. If indeed this is a true story, then to see these people stand up to the powers that be is a ray of hope to all of us that there were people who were strong and principled. We can only hope that there are still people like that out there today.",9,194,237,2 November 2008
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat makes it to the big screen
","Very funny movie, but if you have been watching Da Ali-G show, this is something you already know. I really think that if you have never seen Borat before, you will like the movie even more than the rest of us who are big fans. Just the shock of meeting Borat for the first time should keep you laughing thru the whole film.The things I liked about the film were, seeing his home village and the reaction of the different people he meets during his travels. He almost got hit by some of the people in New York, while the people at his dinner party seemed to give him the benefit of a doubt, up to the point where he brings in a prostitute. Of course some of the people are just down right morons, like the old guy at the rodeo and the three college stooges in the RV. Now I know why the raised the drinking age to 21 in this country. So if you have never seen Borat before, strap yourself in for a bumpy ride and enjoy, for the rest of us, we get to see Borat for a full hour and a half on the big screen.",9,3,10,5 November 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good special effects
","Lets be honest.  This movie had really good special effects and the actors were not bad.  However, it can not hold a candle to Star Wars and I really expected something better.  I can only hope that with what they have in the way of actors and special effects they will give us more of a movie next time.  I hated all the furry little creatures in the last movie, but even that one was more of a movie then this one.  Help me Obewan Canobe your my only hope.",8,0,1,10 April 2000
3:10 to Yuma," Very well made film
","This was unquestionably one of the best movies of the year so far. It was a well made remake with great acting from everyone including; Christian Bale, Russell Crowe, Ben Foster and surprisingly Peter Fonda. The movie had the perfect feel and texture of Arizona in the late 1800's and was totally entertaining from the opening credits to the last scene. It must take a lot of work by a lot of people to have such attention to detail in a film, but I have to give most of the credit to the director, James Mangold, for getting the actors, props, animals, and music to all come together and work so well. One thing I did want to comment on was, there have been some people on this site that have said that Russell Crowe's character did not stay true to form or that they could not believe the changes. Well I have to disagree with that. It is true that he was a ruthless killer but there are three scenes that were foreshadowing for his actions. One was when he said that even bad guys love their mothers, another was when he said that she left him reading the bible for three days and never came back for him, and the last was when he said that he would not last long as leader of the gang if he wasn't totally bad. When he saw the relationship between Christian Bale, whom he admired, and his family, I think he knew that this was the real true value in life, and in that moment of 'weakness' he knew what he had to do.",9,3,6,10 September 2007
The Hangover," Very funny adult movie
","I was not in a really good mood when I went to see this movie and I thought that I needed some mindless humor to cheer me up a bit. To my surprise, this movie turned out to be really funny and endearing at the same time. I found myself actually liking everyone acting in this film. The humor was more intelligent then I had expected and I found myself completely engrossed in the situations on the screen. Don't get me wrong, it was still raunchy guy stuff, but the writing and chemistry of this film are way beyond normal mass produced material. But the main reason that I am writing this review is because I don't understand the people that give this movie a rating of one or two. It is OK if you don't care for this type of humor, but it is something else to say the movie was real bad, even when the rest of the movie theater is laughing out loud throughout the whole film. Do you think the rest of the people in the theater are mindless freaks, or are you so self absorbed that you don't realize the rest of the people are really enjoying the film? Anyway, it is a bachelor movie about four guys that go to Vegas, that should give you some insight into what kind of movie it is going to be, and as such, it is really, really funny.",9,2,4,15 June 2009
Spartacus," Another Stanley Kubrick masterpiece
","Having just seen Gladiator this week, a very good film, I went back to see Spartacus again.  Although it lacks the special effects of the new film, it has great acting and more soul as a movie.  I would not change a thing. Once again Kubrick is at his best making us feel everything on a human level while giving us a visual masterpiece.  For these reasons I think it is the best of all Roman epics and would recommend that everyone see this film.",10,0,1,8 May 2000
Casablanca," Just Great
","What is really strange to me is that I was talking to a few people at work and most of the younger people said to me that 'I don't do black and white'. As if this was a strange and odd way to see a movie.  All I can say is maybe they don't know anything about American culture.  Does 'I don't do black and white' mean that 'I am an idiot'.  I don't know.  But what I do know is that this movie is a true American work of art.  One of the best indications of what we as Americans have given to the rest of the world. When non-Americans say that we as a nation have nothing in the way of culture, let them see this movie and tell me that Americans don't have culture. What I am trying to say is that Casablanca is not only great entertainment but it shows that Americans can express the true human condition through film as well as anyone can through the written word.",10,1,1,22 March 2000
Erin Brockovich," Women Power
",I liked it in spite of myself.  Took my wife to see the film and found myself enjoying it.  It is based on a true story and to see what can happen in a small town in California makes you wonder what is really going on in the rest of the world.  I only hope that the strength and resolve portrayed by this lady is alive and well in others around the world.  It made me feel a little inadequate that I as an aerospace engineer don't have as much resolve as this women who never even went to college. If this story is true then it is a great testament to the human condition.,8,0,0,10 April 2000
Meet the Parents," Very funny
","This was a very funny film.  If not one that had many drop dead funny jokes, it was a film that kept a smile on my face from the opening song to the very last shot. Most of the gags took time to develop and you could see them coming from a mile away but it didn't matter, it was still funny.  The two main actors made this whole movie.  I do not think I would have liked this movie at all if it were not for them. They were great.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone of any age.",10,0,0,9 October 2000
Star Trek," Trek back to the future opens a whole new universe.
","This new star trek film is an amazing achievement. On its own merits, it is a well made science fiction movie with great acting made easy by a good story and very well done special effects. It blends the real world of today with the possibilities of the future with seamless effectiveness. It is almost like reading a good Asimov sci-fi novel, but only come to life on the big screen. From the opening scene, it is clear that human emotion and interaction are central to the story, something missing from many of the sci-fi pictures being made. As to the fact that it is a star trek movie, the entire new cast is, in my opinion, just as good and true to the original crew. I have to say that Zachary Quinto, as Spock, was my favorite, it was truly a really good performance. But Karl Urban, as Bones, was the greatest surprise; I did not believe anyone could ever pull off playing Dr. McCoy, but he did with all the emotion, insight and fun. Most of the credit has to go to J.J. Abrams, he has put together a very smart, fast passedand cohesive film, the fact that he has also rejuvenated the best loved sci-fi entity in the universe is further testament to his achievement.",10,5,15,10 May 2009
Memento," Simply one of the best
","This is one of the best movies of all time.  If you did not like this film, please don't say a word because it only shows how little you know about film as art.  Go see Scooby-Doo and have a good time.  Although film is entertainment, once and awhile a film is made that proves that America does have some culture.  Some people are still making films that can make people think. Go see this film and let me know who you think gets to keep all the money.",10,1,2,13 July 2002
Captain Marvel," Not bad at all
","Wow all the hate!! This movie was a lot of fun. It had Stan Lee on a train, it had great acting Agents looking like they were young, it had good fight action and it had a great cat. All this and a decent story that clears up a lot about Marvel stuff and the origin of Captain Marvel the X USAF fighter pilot.",8,1,3,10 March 2019
Superbad," Funny Movie
","In one scene Evan, (Michael Cera) finally gets alone with the girl of his dreams. She is drunk and he is a little tipsy also. She does a drunken dance for him and then proceeds to undress both of them. He is finally in the position that he has been waiting for his whole life. But he is not that drunk and he tells her that this is not the way he had pictured it: Both of them drunk and her begging him to do her. She continues to try and get him to do her, and he tells her, that maybe they should slow down. Then she tells him, to stop being a little b--ch about it. He just looks at her and he says, 'Did you just call me a b--ch? Wow, talk about losing your innocence. All at once, he was getting to go all the way, and he also finds out that people are not what you dreamed they would be. It is stuff like that that keeps this movie a step ahead of all the other high school movies. That, and the fact that it is really, really funny.",9,5,12,18 August 2007
Juno," Very good movie
","I had put off going to see this movie, how many teen high school movies can you see in one lifetime. But since it was up for best picture, we decided to go see it before the awards tomorrow and I am glad we did. For me, it was the best picture I have seen this year. It is by far the best written movie of the year and all the actors were just brilliant. It just goes to prove that if you give actors a great scrip and good direction; they will do a good job. After all this time, I even liked Jenifer Garner. Unlike other teen movies, the adults were a major part of the story and were portrayed with depth and real human characteristics. I highly recommend this movie for all teens and even for all adults who may think they have already seen too many high school films.",10,2,7,23 February 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Good Summer Entertainment
","It was very hot here in Phoenix so I took the family out to see a movie. For more then three hours we were totally entertained by the third Pirates of the Caribbean film. Yes it has complicated plot twists, it is more or less a rehash of the first two films as far as characters and special effects, and the acting was not inspirational, but boy was it fun to watch. As a movie, I guess it all depends on what your expectations are; we wanted to see Keith Richards, he was great and deserved to have more screen time, we wanted to see what happens with William Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), we wanted to see pirates fighting on the high seas, and we wanted to see if Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) would be brought back to the realm of the living. Not high expectations, but all were met and the three hours seemed to go by quickly as we were transported into a world of swashbuckling, magic, and deeds of heroism and treachery.",8,1,3,28 May 2007
X-Men," Great Summer Fun
","Most of the movies I have seen this summer have been a disappointment, this one was not.  Having been a marvel comic book reader when I was young, I thought it would be real hard to get the look and feel of the X-Men on film. This film got it right.  Not since the first Batman film has anyone made a really good comic book movie. They make everything look good, even the Storm.  It may not be the best Hollywood movie but for a summer blockbuster it is very entertaining.",10,0,0,15 July 2000
Spider-Man 3," Great movie but why the SAPPY ending?
","This was a really good film. The story line was so good that it had me completely engrossed for the whole time, up to the last 10 minutes when it turned a little too sappy for me. This was more of a thinking man's film then the other two and you really had to follow the story to feel what was going on inside all of the main characters. Also, once again JK Simmons's JJ Jameson was the truest to the comics but everyone was great. Eddie Brock was the perfect anti-Parker Venom, Thomas Haden Church was brilliant as the Sandman. These two are real good actors and they brought a life to their characters that was missing in the last two films. Kirsten Dunst and Bryce Howard played off each other very well and made it believable and Tobey Maguire had so much fun playing the dark side that I think they should bring back Black Spidey for the next movie. It had everything you could ask for, the best action by far, the most Spidey humor which is more like the comics, great acting and an over-packed story line that I loved. They could have easily made two or three movies, sort of like a 'LOR'. I have to agree with 'LennyRenquist' another writer here and it is worth repeating when he said; 'the sequence in which Peter turns into the 'lamest bad-boy in historyand the looks on the faces of the 'laydeez' as he struts along the street like a nerdy, emo-midget Travolta are absolutely priceless'. All of this made the movie the most entertaining of the three by far, so it is a wonder to me why Mr. Raimi felt the need to make the ending so SAPPY. This was not Gone with the Wind, the audience was looking for a great Spiderman ending so they could all jump up and cheer. What they got made them sit in silence looking at the credits. Maybe he can re-tool the ending to make this the great movie it should have been.",9,1,2,5 May 2007
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," One of the best movies ever made
","This is without a doubt one of the greatest movies ever made. Stanley Kubrick has an insight into human behavior that no other person can match. Peter Sellers is beyond genius and George C. Scott and Slim Pickens fit right in with the rest of the cast to help produce the greatest satire ever made. This is the key to the greatness of the movie, it is not a just a comedy, it is a SATIRE, that is also very funny. If you understand the use of symbolism, irony, and ridicule to expose the folly of human behavior, you will get how wonderful and smart a film Mr. Kubrick has given us to enjoy. Anyway, I saw it again today and I have to say it is still one of my favorite movies and just great fun to watch. However, I do feel sorry for some of the people who are posting here that do not like the film. One person wrote; 'What the hell is this? Is it a comedy? It's not funny (at all). I did not even smile once, was I supposed to?' Another wrote; 'real comedy to me is White Chicks and Nutty Professor.' I can only say that the movie is not intended to be a true comedy, it is a satire, in which human or individual vices, follies, abuses, or shortcomings are held up to censure by means of ridicule, derision, irony, or other methods, ideally with the intent to bring about improvement. Although satire is usually meant to be funny, the purpose of satire is not primarily humor in itself so much as an attack on something of which the author strongly disapproves, using the weapon of wit. Maybe, before you see this movie you should read something about the time it was made, about the cold war and the real fear people had about nuclear destruction. Or you can read the review posted here by tieman64 from United Kingdom' called 'Ethnic cleansing, 26 July 2008'. It is a brilliant insight into what Mr. Kubrick was trying to achieve.",10,4,8,21 August 2008
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Great effects, but.
","Got to see the film today and I have to say that it is much better then the last one.  The special effects are great, the flying car is a hoot and the last 40 min. is great.  Having said that, I was still left with the feeling, where has the real Star Wars gone?  I really never connected with any of the people in this movie.  There is no-one that can compare with Hans's great wit, Luke's passion, or the unending banter of the princess.  It all seemed like just information not human interaction.  I am old enough to remember how I felt after seeing the first film in 1977, it was an emotional experience.  I loved the movie because I loved all the characters, good and bad.  In this film I was left with waiting for the next great special effect.  Even when people were talking, I found myself looking at the great effects going on around them.  I don't know maybe its just me, but the thing that has made star trek last throughout the years for me is not the special effects, but the interesting characters and the human situations they find themselves in, developed by a great script.  But thats just my take, you should still go see it for yourself.",8,0,1,16 May 2002
Burn After Reading," Very funny adult comedy
","The point here is that this movie is for adults, with adult themes and adult situations. As with all Coen brother movies, there are going to be people who love it and people that hate it. There doesn't seem to be much middle ground. I loved this movie. It was entertaining, dark and very funny. I really liked 'No Country for Old Men' but I have to say, 'Burn After Reading' was a more enjoyable film for me. Some of the reviews here have said that the film rambles around pointlessly, without any clear direction; well I have to disagree, if you are paying attention and you are an adult, you should have no problem understanding what is going on. The best part of the movie is watching this great cast perform brilliantly with the odd-ball material they are given. They are all straight men for the Coen brother's antics. There is violence, bad language, and everyone is sleeping with everyone else, especially George Clooney. But the movie is very funny and while the rest of Hollywood seems to have lost there way, the Coen brothers continue to put out intelligent, entertaining and thought provoking material.",9,289,472,14 September 2008
The Bourne Identity," Very Good Stuff
","Got to see this film today and I have to say that I liked it very much.  It is not the best spy film ever made and the material seemed like I had seen something like it before.  But having said that, the thing I really liked about it was that I cared for the characters and how often can you say that these days (Attack of the Clones,case in point). Matt Damon and Franka Potente were great.  I never liked Matt Damon before, maybe because he is a Red Sox fan and I am from NY, but in this movie he was very good. Even all the supporting players were good, but very under used, like Julia Stiles and Clive Owen. (Clive Owen is great, why this guy can't get some good roles is beyond me.) But the thing that topped it all off for me was the great action shots all over Europe.  That was great.  The movie had the feel of 'The Professional' but shot in Europe.  If you like that kind of stuff you will have a good time.",9,2,2,14 June 2002
"I, Robot"," I liked this movie very much
","I really enjoyed this movie very much. I thought the movie was true to the premise of the book and I cannot understand why any true sci-fi fan did not like it. Please don't listen to what other people said about the movie, because you will miss out on what is really a fun film.The acting was very good and the robots are done well, best of all was Sonny, who brings to life the conflict of what it means to be a sentient being. I, Robot may not be Blade Runner, but it does stand out as a thought provoking sci-fi film. One thing I liked about the movie is that it does not paint a picture of the future that is very much different from today, they still have cars and alarm clocks, but it is a future that may be very possible with the addition of advanced robotics.",10,1,2,23 July 2004
American Beauty," I guess you either love it or hate it. I loved it.
","It seems that this film has sent people running to one side or the other more then President Clinton.  I went to see it when it first came out and had no expectations one way or the other.  What I found was that the acting in this film was so good that it didn't matter that I could not find anyone who I liked as a person.  Maybe that is true to life in America today.  I think what they are trying to say is that although everyone has major problems in their lives, there is still so much beauty in this universe all around us.  Like a good war movie shows the horror that humans can do to each other in some of the most beautiful countries on earth. Why can't people act and be as beautiful as the Nature all around them? 
Anyway these are some of the things that I thought about while viewing the movie.  So to say that the movie was not thought provoking is just not true in my case and I really thought the acting, and that includes the whole cast, was the best I have seen all year.",9,0,0,1 April 2000
Spider-Man," True to form
","Good movie.  This has a little for everyone. For anyone who does not know who spider-man is this movie will let them know every thing they need to know.  It crosses the line and lets all us spider freaks get our kicks and gives a good story to everyone else. The thing about this movie is that they made a really good movie, not a great spider-man comic, but a really good movie.  Great acting, great character development and a good love story. Don't listen to any of the nit pickers, As far as good entertainment goes, this movie is the best so far this year, hands down.  As far as the real spider-man, the only time we see him is at the end of the last fight scene when spider-man is giving it to the green goblin and you can finally see spider-man in the face of Mr.Maguire.  For Mr. Maguire to really work as spider-man he has to keep developing from that scene.  It was a good all around movie and can stand alone as one of the best movies made.  But if you really want to keep this going you will have to make Mr. Maguire develop into a real spider-man, no longer the wimp teenager full of questions, but a real super-hero.  The question is, is Mr. Maguire up to being the real spider-man?",10,0,0,7 May 2002
Pearl Harbor," OK but too Long
","I guess if you take out the first hour of the movie you could say it was a good war flick.  However, that first hour is hard to sit through. The attack parts are done real well, I really liked when they show the prospective of an aircraft flying through the harbor during the attack, it is almost like a really good video game. But, for the price and the wait on line, it was a four hour experience that I wish I waited for the video.",7,0,0,29 May 2001
Tropic Thunder," Tropic Thunder is funny
","I found this movie to be very funny. More than a few times I had to laugh out loud being unable to contain myself. I know there are people who feel offended by this movie and are calling for it to be banned and yada yada yada. But the last time I checked we still had freedom of speech, so if I find this movie, which is a comedy, funny, then in a free society, I should be able to enjoy it without all this political correctness being shoved down my throat by the comedy Gestapo. Ben Stiller has made a smart, entertaining film that showcases the comic prowess of a multitude of today's Hollywood stars. Robert Downey Jr. as an Australian actor playing a black character, Jack Black, as a comedian with a heroin addiction, Brandon T Jackson as a rapper turned actor, and Tom Cruise as the film's producer, are all insanely funny while lampooning the true nature of the people that make up the movie industry today. There are references to Hollywood scandals, and actors playing handicapped roles, there is very bad language throughout and Matthew McConaughey's dilemma of letting a client die for a G-5 aircraft. If these things are offensive to you, then please stay home, you know what this film is going to contain from all these reviews, let the rest of us have an enjoyable summer evening at the movies.",9,3,8,15 August 2008
Quantum of Solace," Solid Bond movie with not so solid action sequences
","After reading many of the posts here about the movie, I did not know what to expect today when I went to see the film. Well I liked it very much and found it very entertaining. Daniel Craig is indeed a very good Bond; he brings a raw power to the role that I feel had been lost since Sean Connery. Without Q and all his gadgets, without the Bond music and without a powerful adversary that wants to take over the world, it is left to a good story, great worldwide scenery and Daniel Craig to carry the day. And on all counts, this film delivers the goods. The story was a good one and all the supporting actors did a great job of making the film seem real and exciting. It was really good to see Giancarlo Giannini, I like everything he has done.Having said all that, what is the deal with all the Bourne rip-off action sequences? They were very aggravating and could have ruined the whole film for me, but like others have said, I just waited for them to end because there is no way of seeing what is going on anyway. What could have been a really great movie has been sabotaged by shaky cameras and choppy editing. It shows very poor judgment and we can only hope that whoever was to blame, will not have anything to do with future Bond movies.",8,2,4,15 November 2008
No Country for Old Men," Good film, no more, no less.
","It is good to read the passion in the reviews on IMD when it comes to a Coen brother's film. People either really love it and can't wait to explain what a great piece of quality cinema it was, or people really hate it and can't understand how anyone could like this violent distortion of life. Unfortunately, I can not be that passionate about this film. The movie was entertaining and the Coen brothers know how to get the best out of their actors. The best performances were turned out by Tommy Lee Jones as a laid back Texas sheriff, a part he has down pat by now. Josh Brolin as a south Texas ex-Vietnam Vet whose actions put this whole story in play. Kelly Macdonald who is surprisingly good as his emotion filled, but somewhat naive wife. And the incredible performance of Javier Bardem as the very scary psychopathic hit man. Unlike Fargo, this Southwest Texas case study was not wholly believable. Maybe the brothers needed to spend some more time there. I don't know, but it seemed to me like law enforcement was a little like the keystone cops, Mexicans road around in trucks with automatic weapons always at the right place at the right time and people were getting killed everywhere and no one did anything. Well I have been there and that is just not the case. Maybe the Coen brothers were using all this as symbolism, but it was just a little too much for me to say this was a great film.",8,0,2,24 November 2007
Batman Begins," Batman Begins Again
","This is a new Batman, not the Batman of TV and past films, and not really the Batman of DC comics. This Batman is really good. He almost makes me fell like I could be Batman, if I had all the money and all the smarts. The movie is a step above all the other theatrical pieces of Batman and uses good acting, good writing and good directing, over political correctness and Hollywood standards. But it also has great stuff, the Batmobile, the new Batsuit, realistic fight scenes, and a cast that is like an old studio stable. This is a really good movie. But I can't help feeling that all of these people can give us an even better film next time.",9,2,3,18 June 2005
Saving Private Ryan," Best war movie ever made
","I saw this movie the first day it was out.  I went in got myself a large popcorn and when the movie started I could not eat or move for the first half hour.  This movie was so powerful that it makes all other war movies seem unrealistic.  It is hard to put into words the feelings I went through while viewing this movie.  I will never look at older people the same way after seeing this film.  What we owe them is everything we have.  Our lives, our freedom, and our way of life.  I understand that this was an American film and I only wish that they could have shown a little more of the sacrifices our allies had to go through.  I can only say, in the movies defense, that most of the younger English and other Europeans already understand the hell their nations went through during WWII, where as this was a learning experience for most Americans.  We tend to take our freedom for granted, like it is a gift from God, but it is movies like this that show us that our way of life is something that the generations before us had to fight and die for.",10,0,1,3 April 2000
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Film as an art form
","I have not seen all of Wes Anderson films, but what I have seen I like. I have not seen every picture in the museums of Europe and New York, but of the ones I have seen I know which ones I like. I liked this film very much; I like it better than any film I have seen this year. It is visually pleasing, the actors are familiar and magnificent and the story was timeless and incredibly human. It is an original work of art that uses humor to convey the realities of human behavior, including greed, lust, love, brutality and the idea that life, in the end, can be what we make it. Ralph Fiennes, Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson and others will keep you entertained while Anderson spins this historical fairy tale. This film might not be for everyone but as Anderson says, you can tell he gets it.",10,5,9,11 July 2014

"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Great fairy tale
","This movie is one of the greatest fairy tales of all time. If there is one thing I did not like about the movie it was the sub-titles.  This is a very visual movie and us Americans miss a lot of it trying to read what is going on. It was like Star Wars in a reality far far away, different from our culture but spell-binding non the less. Great acting and great story telling.  A sci-fi movie down to earth.  I really liked this movie and would recommend you go see it with the idea that it is a fantasy for the soul.  I believe that in the end she jumps because she puts her life in God's hands. And that if God thinks she is worthy, she will get what she hopes for.  I might be wrong but that is what I get from the ending.",9,0,0,3 March 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," This is more like it.
","Being a big fan of the books, I have to say I was a little disappointed with the first movie. For me it played more like a video game then a film. It was OK, but I found the Two Towers to be a much better stand alone movie. It was three hours of pure movie entertainment. Great action, great background (both computer generated and real life), great acting, and gullum was just unreal. Even the part with the live trees was OK, I never thought they would be able to pull that off. All in all it was just great fun. This is not a movie for real young children. There were a few sitting close by us and they were really scared, keep the kiddies at home.",10,0,0,21 December 2002
The Illusionist," Great period piece
","This film may not be for everyone, it is very low keyed and some may say predictable, but it worked just great for me. The cinematography is great, the re-creation of the period in Vienna, the castles, city streets, the theaters, and the people all added to my enjoyment of the film. But it was the acting that really made this movie work for me. Ed Norton, Paul Giamatti, Rufus Sewell and Jessica Biel all made this a wonderful turn of the century piece. The characters were all well developed and each one was convincingly believable. All in all it was one of the better films I have seen this year, it was imaginative and thought provoking, a good film for mature audiences.",9,0,0,4 September 2006
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Good Summer fun
","This movie was a lot of fun; it develops each of the characters nicely and keeps you entertained with its humor and human interaction. Although that is not always a great thing for a comic book movie, it plays true to the FF comics in that they were always a little different from the rest, more story line and less pure bash and bang. The Silver Surfer was great and could have had a larger part, but I will take what I can get. The part of Galactus wasn't great but even in the comics I always though he was a little campy for a destroyer of worlds. We do get to see the human torch mature a little and we also get to see the FF having to fight like a team in order to save the day. However, the real reason I am writing this is because I cannot believe all the Stan Lee bashing on this site. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but Mr. Stan Lee has more class, intelligence and creativity in his little finger then all of you coarse hermaphrodite, pseudo-comic-book-experts put together. To berate the man who has given us all these great charters and has fascinated generations of readers, is just plain dumb.",9,6,13,19 June 2007
Mission: Impossible II," Good action movie
","About all I can say is that this was a very good visual film.  Thanks to Mr. Woo, the action was first rate and the movie had the look and feel of a Bond film.  However, I would have liked a little more in the way of a real thinking mission impossible. But all we get is, hope he kills the germs before the yellow dots get to the red dots, or something to that effect. Nothing new and nothing much to think about, just good looking people in good action shots.  This makes for a fun night out but left me feeling like the spy left out in the cold looking for more substance.",6,0,0,27 May 2000
The Dark Knight," Dark Night Delivers
","Went to see the film in IMAX and it was truly an amazing experience. The sights, sounds and action this film exhibits are outstanding. Christian Bale is at his best playing the Batman, a role that all his previous films have groomed him to play. Aaron Eckhart was surprisingly good as Harvey two face and the scenes with Bale and himself work effortlessly. Gary Oldman has a larger role in this film and he delivers the goods as usual. The rest of the supporting cast is great; Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Maggie Gyllenhaal turn in professional performances, as does Eric Roberts as an Italian crime boss. But make no mistake about it, this picture belongs to Heath Ledger, his performance is the one thing that puts all the pieces together. It is a tortured freighting psychotic performance. He is the one that devises ingenious situations that force everyone else to make impossible ethical decisions. With his smudged make up, lanky hair, darting tongue and faint lisp, he is a nightmare come alive that puts the whole city and audience in a state of hysteria. In all, this was one very good movie, if I had to find a negative, it would be that the movie is too long. The theater was full, and with about 30 minuets left to go, young children were moving all around, leaving and coming back, maybe people should not bring their youngsters to this movie, but it is after all Batman.",9,4,10,19 July 2008
The Last Samurai," Great film, until the end
","Went to see the film last night and really liked most of it. For someone who likes historical or cultural period films this is a must see. There are so many good visual pleasures that the two and half-hours seem to go by very quickly. Even the acting, by everyone, was very good. Then comes the ending. I don't know what it is about the people in Hollywood today, but their need to make their own distorted political statement has not only destroyed true historical events but it has rendered them incapable of making a really good classic film. Because of this self serving Hollywood ending they have delegated this film to be just another of their soon forgotten could-have-been movies. For a film that deals with honor and integrity, they have dishonored the Samurai with their false ending.",9,0,0,11 December 2003
A Clockwork Orange," A Masterpiece
","Film can be good as pure entertainment, but some films can be a work of art that expresses thought and feelings of a generation. This unsurpassed film by a true artist is one of those rare works of art. To anyone who thinks they 'get it' but feel this film is anything less then brilliant, I can only say the true reality is, you don't have a clue. No other film maker could have developed a look into the future with such great intellectual content. It just does not happen. This film is something special on so many different levels, it deals with things that are as relevant today as when it was made. The fact that people today don't take responsibility for their actions, the ultra-violence of youth, the exploitation of politicians for their own profit, the alienation of the poor with no hope for bettering themselves, and the fact that 'its a stinking world because it lets the young get on to the old, there's no respect for law and order no more'. Added to all this, there is also the technical behavior modification that uses classical music as a tool for making one sick. If you don't like this movie then you really don't get it. If you are young and want to experience a true masterpiece then go see this movie and take it all in, but know this, without a doubt, this is one great film.",10,0,0,12 July 2000
The Da Vinci Code," Good book, mediocre movie
","I don't care one way or another if the story is pure fiction, true, or a combination of both. If people are so uninformed about history or religion that they have to learn the truth from a Hollywood movie, then they have greater issues in their lives. However, I do care about spending my money on a movie that is not entertaining. I thought the book was very good, it was thought provoking, and moved along at a fast pace. I cannot say the same for the movie. Maybe because I knew what was coming, but the movie just seemed to move along at a snail's pace and I found none of the conversations between any of the actors enjoyable. It was like everyone was going by the numbers just to get the movie made. Tom Hanks is a very good actor but I found none of the qualities that made him such a good actor in this performance. The one word that comes to mind is bland. The whole movie for me was just too bland. Paul Bettany was good, Sir Ian McKellan was OK and Audrey Tautou was adorable, but where was the fire, the passion, the levity, the chemistry? I would not have cared if they came right out and said that God is a woman, if they could have made a more entertaining movie.",5,0,2,27 May 2006
The Departed," Best American movie in a long time
","Martin Scorsese was already a great America artist but what he has done here transcends mere movie-making and restores my faith in the ability of people today to make a masterpiece. Every week I go to the theater hoping to see a film that will blow me away, and it was getting to the point where I was really thinking that will never happen again. Thank you Mr. Scorsese for a truly great American film. Everything is almost perfect, great story telling, great acting, and great musical score. It's very telling when a crime drama, lased with violence and corruption, still manages to have more humor then most of the comedies produced today. The characters are so well developed and intense, that every scene, every piece of dialogue is mesmerizing. All set to some of the best backdrops ever seen on film. Oh, and one last thing, anyone who thinks that Jack's portrayal is over the top, doesn't have a clue. I have been around people like that and the one thing that comes to mind is that truth is stranger then fiction. All of the characters were spot on and if they offend your sensibility, maybe you should stick to TV.",10,3,6,9 October 2006
Wedding Crashers," Finally, an adult comedy that is really funny
","These days it's very hard to make a funny adult comedy without some group being 'offended'. Already, here in Arizona, some people are giving Senator John McCain a hard time because he had a cameo in this R rated movie. How up tight is that? Well I for one loved this R rated movie and found it to be one of the most intelligent and well-written movies of the year. The catalyst that makes all this work is Vince Vaughn, I was laughing so hard at some of the predicaments he got himself into that I could not hear all of the fast-talking breakneck lines he was spewing out. And although he kept trying to get himself out of them, one of the Wedding Crashing rules, handed down from one generation to the next, 'Never leave a fellow crasher behind', kept him coming back for more. Owen Wilson is also very good as the straight man and he has great chemistry with Vaughn. Even though there are a lot of 'Homo' jokes in this film, these two are so secure in themselves that they can tell each other that they love each other, and you believe them. The supporting cast is also very funny, Christopher Walken (The Continental) is great, Rachel McAdams is a breath of fresh air, and Jane Seymour really pulls off the Mrs. Robertson part. This is a laugh out loud side-splitting film, and although there might be a few slow spots, it is destined to become a comedy classic. So go see it now and have some fun.",9,1,6,16 July 2005
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Madness, Madness.
","Truly one of the best acted movies of all time.  Do yourself a favor and see this film.  Although this movie was made before I was born, I became completely enchanted with it the first time I saw it. It made me a fan of William Holden, which opened me up to many other great Holden movies.",10,0,1,24 March 2000
American Gangster," Good Movie, Great acting.
","My wife and I have been looking forward to seeing this movie for a long time. She loves Denzel and I like Russel Crowe in everything he has made. Also, Ridley Scott has been my favorite director since the death of Mr. Kubrick; Blade Runner, Gladiator, Master and Commander, are all examples of his brilliance. I mention all this because although I thought American Gangster was a good film, and Mr. Washington and Mr. Crowe were both excellent in their roles, I am a little disappointed with Ridley Scott's directing. The character development was good, the feel of the sixties and seventies was right on and the music was great, but the movie was just not the tour de force I was hoping for. I don't know exactly what it was, some other people have said; the length of the movie was too long, or the movie didn't flow as well as it should, and they may be right. But these are not things you come to expect from a Ridley Scott movie. If anything, most of his movies leave me feeling like there should have been more. Anyway, this was a good film and although it might have lagged a little in the middle, I still recommend this movie for the great performances of the actors.",8,1,7,3 November 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Gerat CGI but not much else.
","The opening sequence is an indicator of just how good a movie this is. Although it is a very good CGI of ships in combat there is no real hart to this film. We are bombarded with the CGI capabilities of ILM, but for me there is no solid story telling, no great acting, no comic relief, and absolutely no chemistry between characters in this movie. All the elements that made the first three films more then just good movies, but something really great are missing. I would say that Yoda and R2-D2 are the best characters in this film. And R2-D2 has no lines at all. Lucas seems to be a very bad screenwriter. The inter-action between human actors in this film is just flat out boring. Really good battle scenes save the movie and the last 45 minuets are good enough to make it better then the last Star Wars movie, but there are no Oscar performances here, only the explanation of why there are three great movies to come. But what is really sad is that the three great movies were already made over 20 years ago. Ewan McGregor delivers a good portrayal of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Ian McDiarmid and Samuel L. Jackson deliver good performances as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and Mace Windu. However, all of them fall victim to the sub-par screen writing. I have to agree with others here that Lucas has delivered another movie with modern day style, but for me, this movie has a real lack of substance. This film is more a good video game then it is a good movie.",7,1,1,30 May 2005
Wonder Woman," Wonderful movie
","Don't usually write reviews any more but I had to because of some of the really bad things people are saying about this movie. This happens to be a very good flick regardless of it being a DC. Comic book movie. Hard to understand why a movie with humor, good acting, good charter development, good original story and good action sequences can get some people so upset. I think it is not the movie but the people themselves. This movie is very good entertainment for all ages and anyone who disagrees, really doesn't know what they are talking about. But like they say opinions are like butt holes, everyone has one.",9,11,22,5 June 2017
Vanilla Sky," Boy what a ride
","Open your eyes, this was one good movie.  I went to see this film with my wife and we had two completely different takes on it.  I loved it and my wife hated it.  I thought the acting was great, the images were breath taking and the sound track first class.  It was a Indi sci-fi classic, with Tom Cruse in the lead and really good music.  My wife thought it was too long, confusing, and and a waste of time.It must be said that while I love a good Indi film, like say the 'Opposite of Sex' my wife usually thinks they are too over the top. This film had me going the whole way, first I thought it was a love story, then a murder mystery, then a Psychological thriller, then a sci-fi twister. But the thing I liked most about it was that I could not stop thinking about the film all night.  The images were burnt into my head.  When I first saw the pictures of the girl and her mother and father I wondered why the parents had blond hair. Later in the film when things changed I said OK that explains that.  But then in the end I did not know what was real and what was a dream, even the ending. I asked my wife what she thought and she said 'Who cares'.  I felt like telling her 'Open you eyes'.",9,0,0,17 December 2001
Blade Runner," One of the greatest movies of all time
","It grieves me a little to read some of the other comments about this movie. That it is dated and that other movies like the Matrix blow it away. It is true that the Matrix is a great movie, but the things that set Blade Runner apart from other science fiction movies is the writing, it's sophistication and complexity, the film-nor style and cinematography which are more than brilliant, the acting which is superb, and the musical score which is mesmerizing. All of these things make Blade Runner not only the best science fiction movie ever, but one of the best movies ever made. The interaction between humans and androids leaves us contemplating what it means to be human. The development of everyone in this movie is way beyond any other character development in any science fiction movie ever made. Deckard's shallow, lonely existence, an android that believes she is human and can fall in love. Pleasure androids that show more loyalty and humanity than any human, robotic engineers that can show love for their creations, and warrior androids that care so much about life that they would risk everything for longevity, and in the end let their hated hunter live just for the sake of life itself, 'More Human Than Human'. This movie is a work of American art, to look at it in terms of just special effects does it a great injustice and leads me to believe that those who find it not so good, don't really know anything at all about science fiction or what makes a great film. But then again all of this is just 'tears in the rain'.",10,0,0,31 March 2000
Casino Royale," Good movie that stands on it's own.
","I saw Dr. No with my father when it first came out and have been a Bond fan ever since. I did not know what to expect going in to see this film as I have never seen Daniel Craig in a movie before. The thing that struck me about Casino Royale was that I enjoyed the movie on its own merit; it did not feel like I was watching a 'Bond' film. I don't know how to explain it, but until the end of the movie, I did not think of Mr. Craig as Bond. I don't know if that was what they were trying to do, but he didn't look like Bond and he didn't act like Bond. However, the character did grow on me and in the end I completely enjoyed the movie. Craig had managed to make his own character, that his name was James Bond, was something that I had to get used too. The story was intriguing, the action was intense and realistic without being over the top, and the acting was spot on from everyone, I really liked Giancarlo Giannini, Eva Green, and Judi Dench. All in all, I would recommend this film to everyone, the cinematography in all the locations was great, typical of a Bond film.",8,7,15,18 November 2006
Beowulf," A must see, but only in 3D
","Went to see this movie in a regular theater without 3D and it was really bad, so I went to the customer service center and asked them if my wife and I could pay the extra and go to the 3D IMAX. We paid the extra $4.00 each and got the glasses and sat down just as the movie was starting. WOW what a difference. It was like we were watching a completely different movie. It was really great. The story was the same but the visual experience was completely different. This was by far the best 3D movie we have ever seen. My wife kept grabbing my arm as spears and blood and guts kept flying at us. If you are going to pay money to see this movie in a theater, then you have to see it in 3D. Otherwise don't waste your money. They should have never let this movie be released without 3D. Without 3D this film is just like a bad Saturday morning cartoon. But with the 3D the movie comes alive; it has new depth and excitement that made it very entertaining.",9,2,5,28 November 2007
X2: X-Men United," Great Stuff
","This is America and everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but please, if you don't like this movie stick with reviews of the Ya Ya Sisterhood stuff and leave the rest of us alone. This is a kick butt movie for all of us that have ever read a comic book.  I may be old enough to remember the first Spiderman story, but I never thought I would see a movie capture the real feeling of reading a great comic book, at the movies.  I loved Batman, I loved Spiderman, but the action and atmosphere of this movie is so far the best.  People talk about gender gaps, but if they keep on putting out movies like this, I believe, American pop culture can transcend the generations. If you don't believe all that, then just go see it for fun.",10,0,0,2 May 2003
The Sixth Sense," Very entertaining movie
","I find that a lot of good movies are a disappointment for movie buffs because of all of the press they have to read before they see a movie.  This is one of those movies.  It is a very good movie, the first time I saw it was when it first came out and I liked it very much.  I kind of knew something was up with the dinner on their anniversary and when he could not open the door to the basement.  But I liked this movie on a personal level, it made me think a lot. To me that makes for a good movie.  So if you have not seen the film, don't go in thinking it is going to be the best movie you have ever seen and pay attention to what is going on.  You will enjoy it more.",9,0,0,10 April 2000
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Much better than anything after Episode VI
","This was a very good movie and lots of fun. It's kind of funny listening to people say that this movie did not have the feel of Star Wars. As if they know what it felt like sitting in the audience in 1977 watching Star Wars. I was there at the University of Illinois at Champaign. It was great fun; the audience would sneer and hiss every time Darth Vader came on camera. Sheer entertainment. So if you think that this is some kind of remake or that it did not live up to your expectations of what Star Wars is all about. That's fine, but I can tell you this, for me The Force Awakens does feel and play like a Star Wars movie and it is the first one to do so in over thirty years.",9,2,19,21 December 2015

If someone said they didn't like it, then take away their movie pass and let them watch the Ya, Ya, Sister Club on DVD.

Hart's War," Very good acting
","This movie was not what I expected. I thought it was going to be a Die Hard WWII film. It was not, but what it was was a very well acted study of what people go through in war. Collin Farrell's performance was one of the best I have seen so far this year. This was a very good acted and directed movie.One of the things that I like about it was how it made everything that happened in 1944 seem so contemporary. What I mean is that, the P-51's looked like the most High-tech aircraft, the music they played sounded like new, and the Tanks and equipment were all first class. It was the first movie I have seen that made me feel that 1944 was modern times. Also the idea that everyone in the film had to deal with things they were not to proud of made everyone more human and made the movie something different then what Hollywood is putting out these days. So if you are looking for a Die Hard film you might not like this one. But if you are looking for a well acted realistic move, I think you will be pleasantly surprised, as I was.",9,3,5,26 February 2002

","Went to see this movie today and I cannot understand why all the negativity on this web site. Great movies like Spiderman may have spoiled people or people may have forgotten what makes for a good movie. Good acting, good character development, a likable cast and a story with comic relief. What more can you ask of summer entertainment. Like Batman Begins the story takes time to get to the action, but that is because we are learning about each character, who they are and what is important to them. If you are an old school comic book fan I highly recommend you go see this movie for yourself and have some summer fun. Oh yeah, did I mention Jessica Alba is in this film.",8,3,7,10 July 2005
Gangs of New York," Great historic film
","DiCaprio and Diaz bring a part of our history alive. Daniel Day-Lewis was great and fits like a glove in his character's villainy and brutality and Mr. Scorsese has made another masterpiece. This is a historical film as well as an entertaining one. Mr. Scorsese has reconstruct the details of life in New York in the 19th century and made a narrative of historical change that explains how New Yorkers got from where they were to were they are today.This is truly a rare American film. There is very little in the history of American cinema to prepare you for this version of what really happened. It is not the usual feel good story of moral progress and enlightenment, but rather a blood-soaked tale of revenger that culminates in the New York street riots of 1863. Every American should see this film just for it's historical value. Most young people today have no concept of anything that happened before their life started, and if nothing else, this film will show them a life they could never dream of, but one that truly tells where our society came from.",10,0,0,20 December 2002

Although this movie does not have the soul of Blade Runner or the suspense of Alien, it is a visual masterpiece. For over two hours I was transported into the ancient world. What makes this movie great is the acting and the world according to Scott. The acting of the film veterans is just great and it holds this whole movie together. Then you have Russell Crowe who is again a presence that grabs you every time you see him. I would have followed him into battle and died for him. Bottom line is, really really great entertainment.",10,0,0,5 May 2000

What is really funny is that reading the comments you find two or three people that say this movie was junk.  To say it is not the best of all time is one thing, I like Casablanca and Lawrence of Arabia better myself, but to say that this was a bad movie is unthinkable.
