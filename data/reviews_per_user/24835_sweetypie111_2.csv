E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," et is so cute
",I own the movie and had never watched it until last night.  When i was little my older sisters were too scared to watch it so i never saw it.  I wish i had watched it before. It is such a cute movie.  By the end my friends and i were all crying.  ET is so adorable especially when he is dressed as a ghost at halloween. That was very cute.,10,1,2,31 March 2002
Signs," Wonderful except for the microphones
","POSSIBLE SPOILERSI liked signs.  It was creepy, suspenseful and expertly crafted.  My only problem is that at least 4 times in the film you could see the microphone bobbing up and down above the actors.  Shyamalan must of been in a rush or something not to notice this.  Hopefully they will fix it for the DVD.I've been reading some of the comments here and I'm surprised so many people are complaining about the film.  Some have said that they didnt show enough of the aliens. I think they did show just enough because when you start seeing armies of obvious CGI it makes the film less believable. If you were expecting some epic alien vs earth battle then of course you would be disappointed with the film. The film isnt even about aliens. The title Signs is not even a reference to the crop circles it goes along with the theme of the movie that everything happens for a reason and there are no coincidences.  Someone also mentioned the children weren't realistic. I thought the kids were excellent. When the son kills the dog he isn't sobbing because he is in a state of shock. And for all the people complaining about the plot holes with the aliens you can't really call them plot holes because you don't know everything about this alien race so just let it go.  It's called willing suspension of disbelief. You can't enjoy a movie without it. I also liked the little funny moments during the movie.  It kept the movie from becoming unbearably intense.Overall Signs is worth your time.",9,0,1,12 August 2002
