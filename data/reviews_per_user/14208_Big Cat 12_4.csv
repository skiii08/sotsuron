Casablanca," May well be the best movie ever
",They are numerous positive  comments on this movie-I also think this movie may well be the best ever!I have thought long and hard on why this movie is remember as one of the best.  I have listed the reason why I think this movie is great:1)  This movie was filmed during World War 2 when  our (Allied) victory over the evil Nazis was not a done deal yet. 2)  This movie has a guy (Bogart) finding redemption in two ways: a)  Losing and then winning back his true love (though he rightfully gave her up at the end to her husband). b)  Bogart (as Victor pointed out) got back into the fight for freedom against the Nazis.3)  The dialogue between the main and supporting characters was very sharp and interesting.,Null,0,0,3 August 2002
The Best Years of Our Lives," An all time great
","This movie is only THE best post World War 2 movie ever.  The acting was superb.  I have seen this movie numerous times and still like it. It has stood the test of time, and like a fine wine, just gets better with age.",Null,1,2,15 March 2002
Kelly's Heroes," Good movie that in its own way was an anit-Vietnam war movie
","Kelly's heroes was, in its own way, an anti-Vietnam  war movie.  It takes place in World War 2 where Kelly (Clint Eastwood) leads a bunch of other soldiers behind enemy lines to try to steal  gold (this is not a spoiler, as you will know this fact in the first part of the movie).The reason it was an anti-Vietnam movie was (keep in mind it was filmed in 1970-71-height of the war) that every officer (representing the establishment) is seen either as an idiot or a gung ho lunatic. It even had a hippie (Donald Sutherland) in the movie (I didn't know there was hippies in World War 2).I thought it was an entertaining movie and rate it quite high.",Null,2,3,23 March 2002
The Great Escape," one of the all time greats
","I first saw this movie when it came out and I really like it ,and still do (I even bought the DVD).  It is,of course,based on a actual event though they were some changes (no one jumped a fence on a motorcycle, or flew a German plane). James Garner was super.  Definitely one of my favorite movies.  An 10 out of 10.",Null,2,4,22 March 2002
