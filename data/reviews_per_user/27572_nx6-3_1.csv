Requiem for a Dream," Boring. No story and we've seen the camera tricks before
","This is another movie about drugs with lots of camera tricks that we've seen in many other movies (fast to slow motions, repeating short cuts, shot of actor separate from background movements). Only this movie is without a plot and it is oh so boring.",1,9,19,17 December 2000
