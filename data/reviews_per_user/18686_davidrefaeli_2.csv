Blade Runner 2049," How not to make a sequel: 101
","The original Blade-Runner was a masterpiece. Based on a cult science fiction novel ('Do androids dream of electrical sheep' - by Philip K. Dick), it explored the theme of what does it mean to be human? It had an amazing film-noir like plot, rich with subtle details that don't cry for attention, elegantly crafted scenes, and possibly the best soundtrack in film history (originally composed by Vangelis) - a soundtrack so good you were not completely sure if it's a good movie with some background music, or good music with some background plot. As you were not completely sure about anything in that movie - who were the good guys and who were the bad guys? Who was more human - humans or replicants? Were Blade-Runners replicants or not? ('You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours? Did you ever take that test yourself?') It was an implicit film, rich with symbolism, that always made you doubt and question.Its sequel might try to pick up the same story-line and 'universe', but it completely fails to give any substance of its own. It doesn't make you wonder for a second. There are no doubts as to who are the good guys, and who are bad. The good are obviously good (despite the opening scene), and the bad are ridiculously bad. It is clear. There is no subtlety. It is painfully explicit. As one character put it (in an oh so Donald- Trump like way): 'I am the best' - A line unnecessarily shouting the obvious (yet quite unconvincing) relations between her and the main character. While the original film plot was tightly driven by obvious clear necessity (replicants need to survive), I don't think there's even one scene in the sequel that could not be replaced by another - a mark of an aimless story-line, that is anything but elegant. The original Blade-Runner wasn't fast paced, it took it time, letting the story sink - but the sequel is just painfully and unnecessarily slow. The original movie had soul. It had a distinct and compelling atmosphere. It was crafted by artists with vision who fought to materialize that vision.Its sequel, despite being more shiny, is less than a replicant.",1,21,45,17 October 2017
La La Land," In the Realm of Kitsch
","This movie puzzles. I watched it two days ago and I'm still a bit confused. There is no doubt it is well done. It touches you. The last scene is amazing and brings a tear to the eye. It also full of interesting commentary on life, like when Gossling's band-mate asks him 'How can you be a revolutionist if you're such a traditionalist?' There's amazing freshness that the director brings to the screen - for example, the long car horn flashback, and it's subsequent use throughout the film. But there's no denying the film has issues that - depending on what you're expecting - will affect the way you see it. 1) Is it too long, or too slow? It could be. The first-kiss scene for example, seems to be an endless impossible build up. But the question is - is the kiss really important? If you don't care about rushing to anywhere, maybe you can just enjoy the long dance and talk and fantasy that precedes it. And that's true for the whole film. 2) Is it full of clichés? Yes. It is. You will enter the Realm of Kitsch. But hey - it's a musical for heaven's sake! And it's even called 'La La Land'. So why should you expect anything else? There is no effort to avoid clichés or kitsch - on the contrary, they are sought after and elevated. This movie is an ode to innocence. To the old naive cinema. The characters are not complicated - they have simple drives. The narrative isn't complicated (an important evening, the other promises to be there, but he/she forgot that they have other engagement, etc. - a pure and cliché expression of the conflict between love and life). It sells you the big dreams of 'being an artist' and not 'selling out', of romantic love that transcend time. But so what? These are universal themes, that we all should be reminded of sometimes, even if they are far-far-far from our realist and complicated life. 3) There's also the tiny con that the actors didn't always hit the note too well. But it's not too bad or noticeable. I think if you will take all this into consideration, you will enjoy this movie tremendously. But even if you don't - it's still a good fun movie that is definitely worth seeing.",9,2,7,22 January 2017
