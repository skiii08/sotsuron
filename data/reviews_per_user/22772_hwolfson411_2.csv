The New World," boring
","Although I love U.S. history and the stories of the colonies settling the Americas, one would figure with a few A-list actors that this movie would be worth watching (in its entirety). Fellow movie-goers were leaving throughout the movie. It was very boring, long and could have been told in 20 minutes! Difficult to sit through, better bring a Game Boy.I would not recommend this to people who are have no patience. I wanted to go to the cinema office and ask for my money back, but its too late for that now.HW",2,1,5,29 January 2006
Casino Royale," Best Bond movie in over 20 years
","I loved this movie. Clever, funny, lots of action and Sean Connery may be voted out as best Bond movie actor one day. This movie had less gadgets, no 'Q' but the whole audience including myself was in a trance. The plot was very quick paced and the writer's had ideas that were never used before. I have seen every Bond feature film, and this one is already in my top three.Daniel Craig was brilliant. Any fan of the series who says otherwise is an idiot.It's Indiana Jones meets Ethan Hunt(M.I.) Can't wait for the next Bond 22 to come out!Cheers,H.Wolfson",10,0,1,25 November 2006
