Whip It," Much enjoyed
","I was expecting to enjoy Whip It, but not as much as I did. My appreciation for it is close to that of Juno (8/10). It's always nice to see my expectations exceeded. It's a charming blend of humor and drama without grabbing for too much of either. I like the personality of the film and how it unfolds.Ellen Page is quite appealing to me as an actress and a personality. She's the best thing to come out of Canada in, I dare say, decades. Juliette Lewis is very much in her element. It's good to see Zoe Bell of Tarantino fame. I even like Jimmy Fallon who normally does nothing for me. Pash (Shawkat) is a tad annoying.I'm pleased with every aspect of Drew Barrymore's direction. I'd love for her to direct again if some decent material comes her way. Whip It is a feel good film. When it was over, I felt better about life in general, and not because it was over.",8,1,5,15 January 2011
Scarface," My favorite crime film
","They improved on greatness for this remake of Howard Hawks' 1932 film of the same name. To my mind, this is more than a crime doesn't pay morality tale, just as Al Pacino's Tony Montana is an anti-villain rather than an anti-hero. This is deep filmmaking not to be dismissed in so superficial and parochial a manner.Plot spoilers hereunder: Tony Montana suffered under the boot of Castro in communist Cuba until joining the exodus to America thanks to President Carter's gracious, yet naive open-arms policy. When his friend Manny (Bauer) asks what's coming to him, he says: 'The world, chico, and everything in it.' Ambitious to the hilt, he refuses to eke out an honest existence amidst such wealth and opportunity. Meaning well, he endeavors to relieve his sister (Gina, Mastrantonio) and mother (Colon) of such meagerness to their corruption and indignation, respectively. Hotheaded and highly prone to excess, he wants to take care of mama and sis on the side, while braving his way to the top of Miami's cocaine empire.Other characters include Omar Suarez (Abraham), a lowlife thorn in Tony's side that is not long for the film; Frank (Loggia), a contentedly low-key operator seen as 'soft' by Tony; Mel Bernstein (Yulin), a rat bastard cop who Frank pins on Tony after their falling out; Elvira (Pfeiffer), Frank's girlfriend turned wife of Tony; and Sosa (Shenar), a Bolivian kingpin who starts up serious business with Tony after making it clear that betrayal is not something he finds humorous. Apart from Pacino's of course, I would single out Paul Shenar's performance. Exceptional work all around, but replace Shenar and we have a problem.Tony ends up facing a few years for tax evasion, which gives Sosa leverage over him. To avoid prison on account of Sosa's government connections, he has to help take out a respectable Bolivian journalist. Not a walk in the park, but better than prison, he figures. By this time, Elvira, notwithstanding her own problems, summoned the strength to leave their toxic relationship and look for greener pastures.Paranoid and addled by a cocaine addiction, Tony remains principled, and opts to shoot dead the black-hearted sack of human garbage (Alberto, played very well by Mark Margolis) holding the detonator instead of going ahead with an assassination unexpectedly involving a wife and kids. The journalist makes a damning speech to the United Nations, and Sosa is livid with rage at the betrayal.Tony, not at all in a serene frame of mind, finds Manny living with Gina, and gut-shoots him to death like a mongrel, recalling to mind the wonderfully powerful counterpart scene in Hawks' original. Having warned womanizing Manny against such conduct, Tony was outraged by a sense of betrayal, and did not realize that their relationship (marriage) was not necessarily indecent after all. Consequently, Gina lost her mind before being machine-gunned down by one of Sosa's guys as scores of them commenced their assault. Fuelled by coke and rage, Tony returned fire with a characteristic gusto appropriate under the circumstances. He dies a bullet-riddled dramatic death in front of 'The World is Yours' statue.Torn between a principled, yet conditional respect for life and avaricious criminality, Tony tried to compartmentalize life in a manageable way without success, least of all as it pertained to Sosa, who is not so hung up on moral quandaries. Gina and his mother would have been better off had he remained a dishwasher, but I doubt very much that he would think so of himself.We have Sidney Lumet to credit for the Cuban angle including the Mariel Boatlift. Oliver Stone obviously has a thing or two figured out to have written this masterpiece. Brian De Palma directs brilliantly. We see his Hitchcockian influence in the New York City car scene. I absolutely love synth master Giorgio Moroder's very '80s original score. All the music hits the mark. John A. Alonzo's cinematography and Bruce Weintraub's set decoration are tops. Spanish is used less than would be realistic, but this artistic license works cinematically. There is Spanish in the film, so it is not as though it went out the window.It's in my top 10.",10,2,6,17 September 2011
Ghost," I have grown to love Ghost
","Ghost is the latest of a dozen or so films that I have come to appreciate much more over time. I had seen it a few times in the '90s and liked it, but not on the level of yesterday's viewing. Every film is a world unto itself, and generally speaking, the more interesting the world, the better the film. I like the world of Ghost. I like the treatment of the supernatural. The denial thereof and other character annoyances can be rationalized away quite satisfactorily. I would, however, prefer a more restrained Whoopi Goldberg, who is a little out of control for the sake of humor. It is something of a comedy after all.The special effects hold up very well. Maurice Jarre's score hits the mark (no surprise there). Jerry Zucker directs very competently. Bruce Joel Rubin won the Oscar for his marvelous original screenplay. Demi Moore is a must for Molly. Likewise for Patrick Swayze as Sam. His regrettable and untimely death adds to the mystique. Only a 6.9 on this site, but nothing talks like money with over a half-billion dollars worldwide. If you last saw Ghost many years ago and thought it good, not great, I suggest you rewatch it. It quite touched me, and may do you as well.",9,1,2,26 July 2011
Creed," Good grief!
","Rocky is practically my favorite film, so I felt obliged to buy a ticket soon after Creed's release. The nicest thing I can say about it is that Rocky is still Rocky, and it was nice seeing him again. The fight choreography is also worthy of the series. Additionally, Tessa Thompson adds a little depth as Bianca, and new to the role of Mrs. Creed, Phylicia Rashad of The Cosby Show fame, is a welcomed presence. That pretty well does it for my positive remarks.Although I personally consider it to be even more overrated than Rocky V is underrated (having always appreciated the latter for many reasons), it would be foolish to dissuade anyone in general from seeing Creed given its sweeping popularity. A popularity that I fail to comprehend. Reading several glowing reviews has done little to illuminate it. The general idea seems to be that Michael B. Jordan's Adonis Johnson is a great character who fascinates and inspires people. I see a conflicted pugilist with none of the pizazz and gift of gab crossed with gravitas that characterized Carl Weathers' Apollo Creed as a Goliath to Rocky Balboa's David. Neither Michael B. Jordan nor Adonis Johnson are the stuff of movie magic.As I watched Creed, bewildered by its critical acclaim, I could not help but agree with Rocky that he is a dejected remnant of a bygone time. Perfectly understandable, as I derived much more from his stroll through the zoo with Talia Shire's Adrian in Rocky II than from over two hours of this comparatively soulless offering. The original film absorbed me completely with character after character superlatively realized and a palpably gritty atmosphere, whereas Creed did not draw me in much. The Philadelphia location work explains what little atmosphere there is to speak of. Bianca is a fairly interesting character, whose music is integral to her development, so I will leave it at that. Had Rocky been front and center more often, I would likely think more of the film.Insofar as the ring remains a metaphor for the world at large, the indomitable Sylvester Stallone is still punching as a force in the industry. Although I am quite honestly dumbfounded by the degree of praise Creed has received, I am solaced to know that people remain invested in the Rocky Balboa character and that this adds to the staying power of his creator.",6,4,9,2 December 2015
Crash," Manipulative storytelling
","Crash is not an intelligent treatment of race in modern day America. From the first, the film is a relentless didactic spoon-feeding in the vein of Gran Torino (6/10). It shamelessly interweaves highly unlikely interactions with coincidences galore. As someone who is more than averagely interested in reality, I feel Paul Haggis drops the ball so hard on that score he deflates it. He not only fumbles on the main theme, but also in regards to how the police operate and how foreigners use their native languages. The characters are mostly annoying as well.In my opinion, the film leaves its subject in the dark while casting a light on its audience who, for the most part, find it believable. To each his or her own.",4,4,7,6 January 2011
American Sniper," Bravo!
","Clint Eastwood was in top form for American Sniper, his 34th feature film as director. An Oscar nomination for Best Director would have made very good sense to me. At 84 years old, the man should be an inspiration to geriatrics the world over and the rest of us who hope to live that long. And who better to take a page out of Quentin Tarantino's book by using a great old Ennio Morricone tune? Neither the perilous hell of battle nor the depths of human wickedness have been more powerfully and realistically depicted in my cinematic experience. Furthermore, they dutifully honor Chris Kyle's perspective without it being a pro-Iraq War propaganda piece. It is a skillful balancing act for what is not a political film per se. To say that the film needed an anti-war agenda is tantamount to saying that it would have been better if only they had disrespected the man's memory. Though I myself do not approve of the Iraq War, it is not in black and white terms. I much prefer a challenging, thought-provoking film to an anti-war spoon-feeding.Bradley Cooper seems to take nothing for granted by giving his all to one good role after another. The part of Chris Kyle is his most demanding and transformative. I have liked him in many roles and have long understood him to be a real go-getter and capable actor, but this one stands out as a remarkable achievement. It is one of the better performances that I have ever seen. He insisted on achieving believability and succeeded beyond doubt.There is so much I like about the film that I almost feel like I am pawing in the dark to criticize it. However, another early scene developing the relationship between Kyle and his wife Taya would have been appreciated. Well, that and a preposterous fake baby that I hesitate to mention since I was fooled by it in the theater. But I figure almost everyone who reads this review will have already seen the film.Snipers have a way of captivating the mind and are therefore good film subjects. It is the precise art of marksmanship, the idea of playing God, their strategic importance in warfare, and as the makers of this film understand in spades by having included a sharpshooting adversary named Mustafa, the idea of the hunter being hunted.Chris Kyle risked his life over four tours and roughly 1,000 days in order to protect his fellow soldiers. This was courageous and he is an American hero, no ifs, ands, or buts about it. He is a hero to all people who support an aggressive stance against the enemies of civilization. He had a real and important job to do and did it exceptionally well. This much should be agreeable to anyone in their right mind, however ill-conceived they consider the war. Nevertheless, I have observed a moron explosion in response to the film and fueled by the marvelous success of it. I regret to see such one-note, mouth-breathing opposition to the war in lieu of measured arguments. Snipers also have a way of stirring up emotions.",9,38,78,21 January 2015
Forrest Gump," I couldn't be more pleased with this film
","Forrest Gump achieves a Rockwellian canvas without being head in the clouds about America. Beyond the great pleasure of following Forrest through his storied life, a protagonist neither long on intellect nor burdened by it, the depth of the all around character development has me completely absorbed from beginning to end. It is really something special for a protagonist to have four relationships so well cultivated. I also consider it the best cinematic treatment of the Vietnam War. The nobility and absurdity of it is evinced.Well deserving of its many accolades in one of cinema's best years, the film blends humor and pathos perfectly. It creates a world for itself whereby the few poetic licenses do not detract from the experience. I find no fault in it. It doesn't even have a notable production mistake. Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. restaurants are nice, too! Simply put, Forrest is pure innocence, free of pretense and calculation. A great character unlike any other I have known. I was recently delighted to screen the film for someone who had not seen it, so it is to such people, however few they are, that I address this review.",10,1,2,20 February 2012
Before Sunset," Actual intoxicating perfection
","Rarely do I watch Before Sunrise and not Before Sunset immediately afterward. The former insists on the latter. A divine three hours indeed. The original writing team of Richard Linklater and Kim Krizan get the story credit, while Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke join Linklater for the screenplay credit. Way cool to have actors writing their own sublime dialogue. Funding difficulties forced a minimalism congruous with the naturalism. Done in real time with long continuous shots, there is not a hint of contrivance. I really cannot imagine an improvement of any significance on this superlative film.Before Sunrise ended with Ethan Hawke's Jesse and Julie Delpy's Celine looking forward to their reunion six months later in Vienna. Jesse borrowed $2,000 from his dad to be there, while Celine had to attend her dearly beloved grandmother's funeral that same day. Talk about bad timing, but this was the very grandmother whom Celine visited that summer of '94 and, therefore, without whom they would never have met. Then again, we could say the same for Jesse's ex-girlfriend in Madrid. The absurd interplay of fate and chance intrigues and frustrates. They could have been in different cars on that train from Budapest.The film and trilogy being quintessentially character-driven, Linklater's directorial touch is just right. He begins Before Sunset with a reverse-order montage that beautifully calls to mind that of the first film's ending. Jesse, by this time unhappily married with a 4-year-old son, is in a Parisian bookstore wrapping up a tour for his novel This Time, based on their brief encounter nine years previous. Never connecting with someone so deeply theretofore nor in the intervening nine years, the struggle to remain alive to his experience of their time together compelled him to immortalize that night by sharing with the world the significance of really meeting someone. More than that, he knew it was his best shot at seeing Celine again. Celine, who is working for an environmental organization called Green Cross and in a relationship with an often-away war photojournalist, smiles at a wonder-struck Jesse as he is finishing his talk. So much to say and so little time (just over an hour) before Jesse is to leave for the airport.The years have naturally rendered them more worldly-wise this time around, as is reflected throughout their humorous, incisive dialogue, but having to revert back to a shared sense of hope and meaning is something of a paradox. There is truth to be found in the perceived naiveté of youth. Jesse, emotionally ravaged by their years apart, is torn between an undying love for Celine and the inertia of a loveless marriage, wherefrom his son Hank is the only saving grace. Celine by comparison is more of a closed book: harboring the guilt of missing their rendezvous, she had contentedly resigned herself to a life less delightful, but reading his novel awakened her to how hopelessly starved for meaning and excitement she has since been. Jadedly guarded, she keeps an emotional distance despite the undeniable sparks they again get one on one. How is married Jesse to help her after all? There is a very touching moment on the tourist boat where Celine is at her loquacious best--real salt of the earth stuff--and Jesse, having relived their night together over and over to write his book, is simply compelled to address their preposterous misconnection as the clock ticks away. This leads into ever more personal territory as they exchange sorrowful revelations in a cathartic purge of pent-up grief. Bantering again, Celine hugs him strongly--their first embrace since going their separate ways nine years before--and though playing it cool, she seems to know her waltz (Julie Delpy's wonderful 'A Waltz for a Night') is about to do the trick. The clock be damned, Jesse selects Nina Simone's 'Just in Time' to which Celine respectfully impersonates the iconic singer.Before Sunrise ended on a particularly sad note, so the uplifting nature of this subtly executed ending is all the more satisfying.",10,2,3,22 June 2013
Crazy Heart," An Oscar worthy performance backed by good music
","This film draws comparisons with The Wrestler. I give both an 8/10. As both a fan of country music and pro wrestling, I feel Bridges takes to the music better than Rourke to the wrestling. He is completely convincing as Bad Blake. Robert Duvall is perfectly cast. I was a bit alarmed to see Colin Farrell, who did a fine job, I must admit. As did Maggie Gyllenhaal.Little Buddy's disappearing act could have worked on most any sensible guardian, whatever the establishment. I'm not sold on the negligence. It was a little irritating to see Gyllenhaal's Jean giving it to Bad over this. But that's a minor complaint. Jeff Bridges hits it right out of the park. I want to see more from director/writer Scott Cooper.",8,1,2,14 December 2010
Before Sunrise," An enthralling romance
","I discovered this film soon after its video release on a movie channel one early morning in my mid-teens. More of an action or comedy or action comedy type movie fan at that time, Before Sunrise planted the seeds of my incurable romanticism. My every viewing reaffirms a naturalistic charm that has not and will not wane. I do not go for naturalism invariably. For instance, John Cassavetes' A Woman Under the Influence. No thank you. Not my scene. But my what refreshing naturalism in this trilogy, even when to the point of awkwardness. A very big thanks to Richard Linklater for fleshing out this absolute gem of a film. Very wise of him too to co-write it with a woman, Kim Krizan. Though uncredited, it is worth noting that Delpy and Hawke each had a hand in rewriting this film with Linklater.Knowing from my own experience how easy it is to meet people on trains, I marvel at the thought of how many real life variations there have been and will be of this story. By a most auspicious concatenation of circumstances, Ethan Hawke's Jesse and Julie Delpy's Celine find themselves sitting across from one another on a train from Budapest. They get to talking and detrain in Vienna after some clever convincing from gumptious Jesse. He is to fly back to the US in the morning, while she can spare the time before continuing on home to Paris.They roam about the city together feeling as if in a mutual 'dream world' removed from the ordinary flow of life, all the while engaged in a stream of consciousness dialogue that could lead one to construe them both as self-indulgent; however, that would be a fruitless interpretation. Voluble they may be, but they are sincerely striving for enlightenment individually and mutually. We are social creatures, and though they need not necessarily be romantic relationships, we only really know ourselves in relation to others. Before Sunrise is all about the exhilaration of really meeting and connecting with someone, an experience certainly heightened here by the sexual element. The listening booth scene strikes a deep chord with me in this regard: innocently stealing glances while playing Kath Bloom's 'Come Here' (an excellent song choice), it is their first instance of sexual tension, and moreover, the body language is to be appreciated, as it will be throughout the trilogy.As for the other characters, the part-time actors (played by Karl Bruckschwaiger and Tex Rubinowitz) amuse as they describe their play translated as 'Bring Me the Horns of Wilmington's Cow.' Fortunately given a miss. I like the inclusion of the palm reader (played by Erni Mangold) who imparts her own intrapersonal/interpersonal advice. I especially like the street poet (played by Dominik Castell) whose poem ('Delusion Angel' written by David Jewell) likewise concerns a world out of one's control and the value of a real connection with someone. Both interactions present a sardonic Jesse complemented by a more trustful Celine.In the poignant final montage we look at now familiar locations minus the protagonists, and I for one get the sense of a strikingly indifferent universe. We have seen the 'see you in six months' thing in Love Affair of 1939 and its 1957 remake An Affair to Remember (good films to my mind), but this trilogy makes a World Series winning grand slam home run of it. Too inexperienced to really grasp the rarity of their connection, they opt not to exchange contact information so as to avoid a fizzling out of the relationship. It begs for a sequel if ever a film did.For all the convoluted brilliance of Before Sunset and Before Midnight, those films ultimately capture the spirit of this one. Celine summed up the essence of Before Sunrise and the trilogy with these lines bettered by nothing in cinema: 'You know, I believe if there's any kind of God, it wouldn't be in any of us, not you or me, but just this little space in between. If there's any kind of magic in this world, it must be in the attempt of understanding someone sharing something. I know, it's almost impossible to succeed but who cares really? The answer must be in the attempt.'",10,2,2,22 June 2013
Spectre," Not good by James Bond standards
","After a lively opening in Mexico City with adroit camera work, we are treated to a splendid main title sequence. Thinking back to Adele's titular 'Skyfall' and how it psyched me up, I found Sam Smith's 'Writing's on the Wall' a letdown that foreshadowed further disappointment. (To my surprise—now three weeks later—I enjoyed 'Writing's on the Wall' as performed by Jeremy Kushnier and the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra; so, though not a favorite, I have come to appreciate it.) Two problems are apparent early on: Firstly, we are used to seeing Daniel Craig's 007 bruised and bleeding after dynamic fight scenes, not looking like he had just wrapped up an Omega watch commercial (why undersell the danger?); secondly, 007's sexual dalliances are at first obligatorily forced and ultimately in the realm of self-parody. This worked for Sean Connery and Roger Moore, but is out of place in the Craig era.It takes more than a gathering of talented people and an astronomical budget to make a great James Bond film. By comparison with the sophistication of Casino Royale and Skyfall, Spectre's screenplay is shallow, to put it charitably. The cast, supported by Christoph Waltz, Dave Bautista, Léa Seydoux, and Monica Bellucci, is indeed a plus, but Waltz is underused. This is a multilingual production, and it implies that Waltz's Oberhauser speaks German and Italian, but we get only English from him. If there was ever a time after Inglourious Basterds to capitalize on his linguistic abilities, this was it. Whether to avoid what may have been construed as a rehashing of Quentin Tarantino's work or an unwillingness to rewrite a character not originally intended for Waltz, it is a failure beyond description. As for Oberhauser, he is a Blofeldesque character complete with a white Persian cat. But to later proclaim that he is Blofeld is a meaningless wink and nod to the earlier films, because he appears to go by Oberhauser to all intents and purposes. Waltz himself did not get it. Near the end, Bond finds himself in a compromising position at the hands of Oberhauser, who subjects him to a particular method of torture as described before he is to kill 007 outright. But lo and behold, we are asked to accept that 007's devotion to Seydoux's Madeleine Swann runs so deep that his evil genius arch-nemesis, the 'author' of all his pain, does not really have his methods of torture nailed down after all. I think not. The filmmakers could have deviated from the formula without insulting anyone's intelligence. The watch Q provided should have gone off before Oberhauser's little experiment. Here again—and more to the point—why undersell the danger faced by our dashing hero? Furthermore, 007 and Swann arrive at Oberhauser's place in the desert as guests, not covertly, as would be the norm. This plan of theirs not surprisingly had its drawbacks.With a budget estimated as high as $350 million, I would have appreciated location photography in Tokyo since they based a scene there, even if just an aerial shot and some Japanese influence on the proceedings. I realize that the scene only involved peripheral characters and was meant to move the plot forward, but nevertheless, it was too generic. Having lived there, Tokyo is in many ways my favorite city, so I found myself wanting some sense of the place.Though better than Quantum of Solace, in my opinion, this the 24th official James Bond film is on the whole a disappointment. This is so for specific reasons stated and more generally the ludicrously far-fetched plot, whereby 007 had vanquished many megalomaniacal villains without realizing his adoptive and presumed dead brother was lurking in the shadows. What is more, the final act hinges too much on the supposed depth of emotion between 007 and Swann, a relationship rather ham-handedly developed for all the mileage they try to get out of it. In despite of this being a predominantly negative review, the action sequences are solid, especially the fight on the train with Bautista's Hinx (arguably the best in the series), there are many beautiful location shots, and I was not at all bored during the 148 minute runtime.Spectre is likely to be Daniel Craig's final turn as James Bond. They all have to move on eventually. He sure is a tough act to follow. I, however, remain more optimistic than apprehensive about the future of this franchise.",7,5,10,29 November 2015
The Social Network," Good, not great
","The Social Network is a well-crafted film detailing the trials and tribulations of Facebook's founding. It was interesting to get a sense of the coding process and whatnot by which such a website comes to be. Everyone concerned does a fine job. However, once one has acquainted oneself with the pertinent facts in the story, it oughtn't be that difficult to offer up a proper accounting thereof in the form of a motion picture. For me, The Social Network is interesting with no rewatch value to speak of. It seems too self-aggrandizing to laud the film for its relevance to our time.The advent of websites like Facebook and YouTube seems rather obvious given the attending circumstances. I say so knowing I'll still be saying so in years to come as other people profit astronomically in a likewise fashion.",7,1,1,31 January 2011
