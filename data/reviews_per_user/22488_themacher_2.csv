Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Very Unworthy Beginning, *contains spoilers*
","If you've read many of the latest reviews of this movie, you get the idea that it is pretty horrid.  As one of the MANY long time SW fans, I do have to agree with the populous.  At first, I tried to like this movie, but after multiple viewings I just couldn't put it in the same class as the trilogy. Not even close.  On the first viewing, right after I heard the Trade Federation aliens speak, I suddenly thought that maybe I was seeing a SW spoof.  It was just so ridiculous.  Then reality set in and I was terrified by what I was seeing. Then when they met Jar Jar and he dived into the lake to show the Jedi the way to the underwater city, I was extremely embarrassed.  I could go on and on, but there is no point.  Good thing about the movie was the battle between the two Jedi and Darth Maul.  But the way Maul died was pretty disheartening.  He would just stand there in amazement and let Obi Wan slice him in two, yea right!I'm looking forward to the next installment, Episode II.  Although, I would be lying to all of you if I was to say that I wasn't a little worried that it's going to turn out like Episode I.  The most scary thing to me is knowing that Jar Jar is in Episode II, and that reason alone is enough to make even the loyalist fans sick!  But, on the whole I think it will be better. >",4,1,2,13 March 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Critics can kiss my a$$
","Pure and simple:  I'm as big a Star Wars fan as there is without being a fanatic.  Episode I made me puke and made me leery to see Episode II.  I can honestly say that Star Wars is BACK!!!  Roger Ebert, go eat another dozen doughnuts. Great movie  9/10",9,0,0,17 May 2002
