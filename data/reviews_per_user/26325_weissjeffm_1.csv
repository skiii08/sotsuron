Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Funniest film of the year
","In terms of viewers of this film, there are two groups of people - those who get the joke, and those who are the butt of the joke.Sascha Baron Cohen doesn't actually believe that Kahakhstan is so backwards, nor that Jews are evil money grubbing killers (he's Jewish himself after all). He's making fun of Americans who do. Borat fits right into their stereotypes of how backward faraway nations are (and conversely how America's way is the only way). The Americans featured in the film were all too easily convinced that he's real.I think the central message of this film is that Americans are isolated and ignorant of what the rest of the world is like. It's spot-on and it's presented in the most hilarious possible way.",9,4,12,5 November 2006
