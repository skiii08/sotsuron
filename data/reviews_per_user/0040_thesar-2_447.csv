The Rock," Between a Rock and a Soft Cage
","I was teeter-totting back and forth between 3½ and 4 stars through this recent viewing of 1996's The Rock, a movie: A> I haven't seen in a long time, B> Always loved and in fact, C> I originally gave it 4½/5 stars.Well, time's a changin'. Or maybe I have. Or maybe Bruckheimer/Cage's enormously inferior follow-up Con Air kinda drove the following point to light.It would be a huge surprise (disappointment) if this film got an endorsement from the large gay community in the very area its set in. And they thought Basic Instinct was bad.I only point out the few, but extreme, scenes of homophobia because, well, it's just not right. (They elaborate in ridiculing homosexuals in Con Air, but that's another story/review.) It's not right, because it teaches the core audience, teen boys to mid 30s, that making fun of gays (or blacks, or any creed) is not only an acceptable practice, but funny! It's not and I digress The other problem I had was Cage. Over! Under! Acting seems to be his moto. Too bad 'Good' isn't part of his forte. Man, he was distracting! Thankfully, not only did Connery act circles around him, but went beyond Cage's performance to balance out the film.Get past the two negatives, and Action and Movie fans rejoice! There is, in fact, a way to combine plot with leave-your-brain-at-the-door action. But, I hate to say, they might have overshot it a bit. There was just too much.Suffice to say, it's a Hannibal Lecter (Actually, Mason, played by Connery) story in which Goodspeed (unoriginal and inconvincibly played by Cage) takes on the aid of 'The Prisoner with No Name' to break into 'The Rock' when he was the only one to break out due to some treasonous/mercenaries who are threatening San Francisco with toxic green balls. And not from The Hulk.Oh, there's a lot more: a distraught daughter, a confused and stupid and pregnant girlfriend, a dead wife, dimwitted military bozos who should be dead or discharged, soldiers on this side, that side, all with ulterior motives and much, much more. Sure, it's my quest to get intelligent action (SEE: The Bourne Trilogy, or The Dark Knight) but enough's enough.That said, it's a fun movie. Connery makes it really worth wild even though he doesn't show up until the movie got going. But, unfortunately for him, the director, writer or idiot, kept him running around in circles, literally, in the final act. I don't blame Connery for that; I think he was just given poor direction. Sure, his character was supposed to be the iffy hero, but they had him trotting around like a buffoon until he did what we all knew he would.Spoiler alert, the ending? Could it be any more Shawshank? If you can get past the homophobia (please do,) the enormously bad acting from Cage and oh, lest I forget, the far-too-many (director Bay's favorite) slo-mo scenes, the extensive action alongside Connery was good enough for a recommendation. It's always refreshing to re-visit pre-CGI movies. Don't call me old-fashioned. I like movies that took more time out of the computer room and into realism. With heart. Sorry, Avatar fans, we're still not there yet, so make action look real.",6,1,2,19 July 2010
The Blair Witch Project," The Real Witchbusters
","The coolest thing about seeing The Blair Witch Project back in 1999, probably two weeks following its release, was that people still believed one of the biggest movie hoaxes and most cleverest marketing ideas in cinema history. (This was marketed as a documentary on 'true life' footage found when three young adults died from an apparent witch attack.) I even remember seeing the TV (later to be confirmed as a Mockumentary) special recapping what 'actually' happened during the incidents of three film students that went into the witch'fested woods and never returned.Now, I don't believe in ghosts, 'real' witches, spooks, etc, so I never bought it. And my disbelief runs so deep, that the movie never once frightened me, despite my appreciation for what the film was. (AT THE TIME, that isand I'll get into that later.)I do want to clarify, and I'm getting ahead of myself, something from that last paragraph: while I was not spooked, there was a moment, not 10 seconds from the end credits that was very creepy and thought was the most effective shot in the movie. Again – not scary, but absolutely eerie.Much like what Star Wars (Episode IV: A New Hope) was to that time period, was The Blair Witch Project to the late nineties. It was the found footage newborn. Sure, there were many, manyhorrifyingly too many rip-offs and more found footage films to come, and yeah, there were just a minute number before this, but this was the nice, original and refreshing in 1999. Again, I did not believe this was a true story, but they sure as hell made you at very least believe it was. And they did all that with almost absolutely nothing. I truly admire this movie.The story was jokingly simple and that's not a bad thing when it comes to horror; think about: the masterpiece Halloween's thin script. As an amateur documentary project, two film student friends and a third newly recruited film student venture off into the woods where supposedly (to them) a witch killed many, including a lot of children decades past. Beforehand, in a fairly brilliant scene, they interview the just-outside-the-woods townsfolk for their take on the legend of the infamous Blair Witch.Once inside the woods they're armed with their camping gear, expensive, yet 'borrowed' cameras, a device known to us to be the pre-GPS: 'a map,' and tons of batteries to 'run a small third world county.' That last one, I loved for, they actually explain why they can continuous film miles from an electrical socket and yet, for the countless – and unnecessary found footage films to follow, they seemed to have forgotten that simple plot explanation and make us believe their devices will basically run for weeks without a recharge. My phone dies in probably 4 hours without a charge.But, I digress. Basically, the two males of the triangle of terrors are lead by the bitch (yeah, she was) Heather who claims to 'know where they're going' deep inside the woods. As this does NOT turn out to be the case, tensions rise, and the typical motions of getting lost and feeling hopeless emerge. Oh, and lest we forget, there might be a witch out there hunting the witch hunters?While I had admitted I wasn't frightened in this movie, this type of movie or pretty much any ghost stories, such as the weak 'found footage series of the next generation' Paranormal Activity franchise, I found the built up tension, comradery between the cast of three, the comedy, cinematography, music and dialogue real enough. They actually convinced me – and this is a rarity, for me – that if I had believed in ghosts, etc, I would absolutely have fallen for the ruse the marketing team came up with. And perhaps, it would've been even more fun to watch it. But, then again, I'm really too smart for that.Sadly, since, again, there has been countless, and mostly insipid found footage films since, if one were to watch this today, for the first time, they might be jaded and dislike it. I can dig that; but for those who pretty much started here, I'm sure there are more people that enjoyed this. For, I did love this movie and still today do.Side Note: It helps I had/have a major crush on the actor and character 'Mike.' Now, I wouldn't have rated the movie higher just because of my attraction, but it sure as hell helped while watching this. Further, and again not a star up or down in my rating, I would've preferred in a movie that basically only featured THREE actors, that Mike would have been shown more. It seems like the percentage of on screen time: (the bitch) Heather: 40%, Josh: 35% and Mike: 25%. Oh, well; that's why they made pause.",8,3,5,3 April 2013
The King's Speech," I'll Be Expecting a King's Speech Come Oscar Night
","In what I considered one of the worst years on movie record, 2010, comes the (ONLY) second five-star feature: The King's Speechand I'm not even into period-piece dramas.Beyond the luscious landscapes, sets and overall cinematography, was the originality and comradeship of the two leads: King George VI (the ever-brilliant Colin Firth) and Lionel Logue (the even-better Geoffrey Rush.) Not only did they drive the movie, but I couldn't get enough of (the) Rush.Maybe I see myself in secondary actorsin real life. Though everyone's focusing on Natalie Portman in Black Swan, I was drawn, almost exclusively to Mila Kunis – who I strongly feel she should win for best supporting actress, regardless of Portman winning. Same here: people are all up in ARMS for the King (Firth) while I absolutely loved every minute of screen time for Rush.I hope I'm not short-selling this movie. It's a beautiful, nearly masterpiece of filmmaking, tale of a stuttering soon-to-be King who must align the UK when Hitler's setting the stage for his eventual downfall.Regrettably, it took me awhile to see this. Again, I'm not into costume-dramas and I initially thought this was too simple of a story of a man who has trouble speaking, but must overcome the handicap in order to be the, well, voice of his country.My bad. This movie lifted me. It made the 1930s as real as if Doc Brown had me ride shotgun there. Full circle: thanks to the unorthodox methods of Lionel the speechmaker.His methods obviously works, as in, getting speech-impediments curbed, but his 'let's keep it on the same playing field' was what perked my interest. For an example, just listen and love the name he uses for the king.The movie is very simple, as the plot's already stated in my review. But it's character-driven, which I love, it's moving and definitely sparked more interest in me about the ins/outs of the kingdom in England than another movie I cherished: The Queen.I feel I'm really simplifying this film, and even then, I strongly suggest you watch this. It won't move mountains, but it might uplift you. Rekindle the hope in powerful movies (and performances.) And it might give you (yet another, but very nicely) point of WWII-view you might not have considered, like the direct combat Saving Private Ryan or Atonement did.It's rated Ronly for languagethink of it as therapy. And it's funny, thanks again to Rush. He had me rolling in parts. Maybe I see myself in himyeah, I have no tolerance for 'political' or 'authoritative' figures or heads of states. We're all humans and if we must respect each other and coexist, we must stand one by one, I believe. Thankfully Lionel teaches/preaches that. He's my English Idol.",10,0,1,30 January 2011
Despicable Me 2," Me 2 Likey
","Part one took me awhile to watch and I was blown away on how great it was. I was sad that I missed it in the theatre. Unfortunately, it also took me a long time to finally see part two, for I just watched it now exactly, to the day, 4 months following its release.Despicable Me 2 was an enormously fun ride and I found myself laughing and enjoying the ride for the most part. While it was prime entertainment for a very disappointing movie summer season, it truly felt like a sequel and ended up below the magic of the first film.Retired from the bad-man game, Gru's recruited to catch a live-criminal who wants toTAKE OVER THE WORLD. Meanwhile, he's dealing with his girls, more girls and his wonderful minions who never cease to wonderfully though never overbearingly steal each scene they're in.This summer produced several sequels (or in one case, a prequel) to big-named animated features. This one tops the Monsters University prequel but I cannot comment on the Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs sequel since I have seen neither the original nor the follow-up.Despicable Me 2 does drag in spots and tries too hard to place too many and unnecessary subplots, but for the grand majority of it, it's hilarious, inventive and just plain fun.* * * Final thoughts: Okay, fine, I'm sold on the Minions Movieif only it's not overkill. Ha, yeah, right.",8,0,0,3 November 2013
The Mask," Smokin', Everyone Was
","Quick! (Just like the Mask) Let me tell you my story.Honestly, I don't remember if I saw this in theatres. I probably did, because what I do remember in early 1996, is buying the VHS copy of this movie and I watched it a grand total of 5-6 times in under a week. I recall watching The Mask over and over and never getting sick of it. Sure, I had plenty of other movies to watch, but this onewas so much fun.And it still is today. Recently, I bought this movie on BluRay, because I remember loving it, but haven't seen it in over 10 years. I seriously had just as much fun today as I did with those multiple viewings when I first bought the VHS. This movie really holds up from the many years since its release. It really is timeless.Goody-Man Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) is transformed into the daredevil Mask figure when he finds, and dons an ancient wooden mask, and his inner desires come out tenfold. He goes for the girl, inadvertently pisses off the mob and takes care of business as 'The Mask' superhero/cartoon character that mild-mannered Stanley couldn't.The story isn't exactly new, even for 1994, but it's take on the age-old underdog/superhero is fresh, exciting and most of all HILARIOUS.As a matter of fact, when prepping and watching the movie to write this review, I was puzzled on which genre this movie fit in: Action/Adventure + SuperHero? Or Comedy + the rest mentioned? And as I found myself laughing and laughing, even after my 5+ original viewings, I settled on: This MUST be a comedywith a close second of Action/adventure + SuperHero.I think this is a very underrated film. It was a very old concept that was a ton of fun, thanks to Jim Carrey at his peak and newcomer, Cameron Diaz who (almost) stole every scene she was in. She was gorgeous and talented and it was hard to believe that this was her first outing. Honestly, as much as I do like her, but not so much every movie she's been in – though I do enjoy a lot of her films, she was fantastic in this. And I understand that dog was like a prop, I still LOVED little Milo. You have to suspend your disbelief a lot during this movie, so you might as well believe all the dog accomplished.This movie is so straight forward to typical movie viewers and still, it's a lot of fun. And it contains one of my all-time favorite scenes/songs in any movie: The Cuban Pete dance segment. Pricelessas was this movie. See it! It still holds up today and despite all the smoking, especially if you're against that, it's a helluva lot of fun.",9,1,1,13 April 2013
The Avengers," Avengers United
","Take that, Transformers! THAT'S how you show a city under attack with heart, action, pacing, special effects, fun, excitement, characters to root for, humans to empathize with and most of all, legitimate comprehensiveness.Cross-over films are rare, but I'm a fan of them. Freddy Vs. Jason did a great job of bringing two of my childhood favorites together in 2003. Nine years later, The Avengers didn't really bring together my favorites, but it sure as hell put very good characters in a fantastic action/adventure superhero film.Aside from some second-act pacing problems and an insipid villain with extremely questionable and blurry motives, the movie worked extremely well with huge, unique and deafening explosions, some of the best 3-D I've seen – and I'm hugely critical of that format, large action sets, fairly good score and cinematography, deep characters and a whole lot of humor. Further everyone with the exception of Hulk, had equal sharing time on screen. (Sadly, Hulk had only two scenes, albeit THEY WERE WORTH IT. They blew whatever the previous two entire movies based on his character out of the water.)Very nicely, you wouldn't have had to see the previous six or so Marvel/Avenger movies – they were extremely crafty re-introducing them and their individual backdrops with swiftness. But, if you had see the other films, like I have, they included everyone you loved from before, including a cameo from someone I prayed would be in this. Hint: Initials PP.During a secret-agency S.H.I.E.L.D experiment with a mysterious blue box of the gods, evil and jealous brother of god Thor, Loki strolls into our realm and is hell-bent on ruling Earth. I guess it's time to assemble Earth's Mightiest Heroes for the Avenger initiative.Of course, like creator Stan Lee's brilliance displayed over the decades, these aren't your normal super-heroes; they have depth and typically are individuals not playing well with others. Hence, a good portion of this film is a boxing match. Naturally, there are reasons behind this as well furthering the overall depth of the epic.Will the Avengers avenge Earth? I don't want to spoil it, but you'd really have to be blind not to know. I can definitely say they each uniquely KICK ASS in their respect roles.Probably thanks to, or in conjunction with good direction, these actors KNEW their roles and had them down pat. With the exception of new-(to the series)-Mark Ruffalo as Dr. Bruce Banner, each one of them, again with 80% equal sharing time, were pitch-perfect.I always love Robert Downey Jr and especially in his Iron Man role, and if you did, too, you'll be laughing and marveling at his performance all over again. Same with Chris Evans who was GREAT as Captain America and really had his character pegged. Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury were good and even though Jackson had to tone down to the PG-13, he was still badass. Scarlett Johansson was awesome and still gorgeous and Jeremy Renner was a lot of fun to watch again. (Recently he was wonderful in Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol and hopefully he'll continue the trend in the fourth Bourne film later this summer.)Finally, Mark Ruffalo has always been an actor I've admired and I think he did fine here and oodles better than Edward Norton, the last Dr. Bruce Banner actor. But, I still think, movie-wise, that is, Eric Bana has been my favorite Bruce. (Note: I said Bruce, because Bill Bixby will always be the best Dr. Banner ever.)Excluding Loki's horned and silly god-outfit, I actually bought their costumes. And this is saying a lot for a movie that I previously scuffed at the sight of the funny blue Captain America uniform and when he donned them in the film, I feel right into it. I believe that's thanks to Evans who was so great that it never occurred to me for him to have anything else on.I believe the overall movie elevated itself higher than what could've happened with a premise of assembling multiple superheroes and story lines. That said, the special effects were about 90% fantastic with the remaining percentage devoted to the awful out-of-world and in space aliens surrounding the ho-hum and dull villain. They had the same problem with the original Thor movie and (on the DC-side) Green Lantern.I wanted to rank and rate this movie higher, especially since I had an absolute blast laughing my ass off and was captivated with the action fun, but in addition to what I previously wrote: second act pacing problems, laughable aliens and bad villain, it also had the clichéd go-to 'idiotic idea' in the very climax, I downgraded it a bit. Still, I awarded it 4/5 stars and cannot wait to see it again. Preferably on IMAX again.SEE IT – even if you're not a fan of the superhero franchises.Now BRING ON WHAT I REALLY WANT TO SEE: the Justice League movie!!",8,1,6,3 March 2013
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Dora the Explorer called and she has some suggestions for #3
","It's been a very long time since I saw the below average original, and I have been craving a good and fun adventure. Obviously, I was thinking they stepped up the game to the surprise hit, first movie, but, alas, 'National Treasure: Book of Secrets' was a lot worse. Every time I wanted to like this silly, SILLY movie, my mouth kept dropping and it simply got more preposterous. And I'm not just referring to the plot. They made a dumbed-down kid version of 'Indiana Jones' and yes, even younger than 'Young Indiana Jones,' so you really have to be prepared for the simplest versions of espionage, dialogue okay for a preschool play and a storyline even Dora the Explorer would turn her nose at. Sadly, it's not a standalone movie; they expected you to remember every character and relationship from the first one as they give almost zero background. This was a problem for me since it's been years since I saw #1. That said, apparently Benny (played by Cage – who now ranks as one of the worst actors of all time, his one shinning grace was 'Leaving Las Vegas' and I think he should have left Hollywood as well) is upset because his great-great-whatever relative might have been involved in the assassination of President Lincoln and Benny will stop at nothing to clear his name! Including kidnapping the President! A very forgiving President, of course. 'Oh, well, if you're trying to clear a dead man's name, I can see why it's justified in committing a felony.' I'm really looking in too deep into this globetrotting and predictable 'adventure,' but I was disappointed in that you don't have to G-rate down all the gags, acting, dialogue and sooo-secret twists to have a great movie (see: Indy 1 & 3.)",2,4,5,5 September 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," See, I told you we had unfinished business
","Honestly, I wasn't anticipating Kill Bill Vol. 2 to be better than Vol. 1. In fact, I thought I would be bored since I already knew Tarantino generally cuts back on the action and ups the dialogue in the second half of his story lines.Of course, I had to see the finale of the seriesso far. (Again, I'm not looking forward to a Vol. 3 – spoiler alert, I don't want to see 'The Bride' die, like the future setup movie it's sounds like it might be.) I was NOT disappointed. In fact, Vol. 2 is actually better.While Thurman still does an excellent job – her best performance (EVER) was in Vol. 1-2, everyone else stepped up their game. Madsen, as always, was great and Hannah was perfect. Even (new to the series, character) Esteban (Parks) was wonderful. But the scene-stealer award goes to the late Carradine, God rest his soul. Honestly, as many things that were masterful about this movie, he was worth the entire admission price.Plot line: 'The Bride' continues down her revenge path and continues to get knocked down in the process. Way down, like 6-feet-under, literally in one scene.More background is revealed, as well as more subplots. And the obvious final confrontation with Bill and her daughter – no spoiler, since that was foretold in Vol. 1.While the action is cut down in Vol. 2, the plot, dialogue, suspense and plot moves forward in fast-motion. Tarantino again delivers, but this time, 2-fold. And with the finale speech from Carradine, it ends on a perfect note. (It helps I'm a huge Superman fan.) Not to be redundant from my Vol. 1 review, again, everything works in this movie: Music, score, style, acting, originality, suspense, action, cinematography and dialogue. Everyone should see both Vol. 1 and 2. I loved all the actors in this movie, especially the extended roles of Carradine and Parks.",9,0,1,26 November 2009
Black Swan," All About Ms. Swan
","Yep, everyone's talking all about Natalie Portman as Nina Sayers in 2010's Black Swan. For that, I will put three of my two cents in: 1. She was, in fact, very good and will be nominated for a Best Actress Oscar. 2. But, as good as she was, one of my votes goes to Kunis as Lily. 3. And my other vote goes to Annette Bening for The Kids Are All Right. Sorry, little miss Princess Padmé.But, what about the movie? Did you like the Bette Davis classic All About Eve?Okay, it's not exactly like that, or I might be spoiling too much, but it fits the same lines. In this case, we have ballerinas who prove it's NOT easy being black. (Uh, that's a reference to the Swanin case you were thinking of calling me a racist.)We have two aging dancers, the disturbed mom, Erica (Hershey), of Nina and the recipient of the Drama Queen award: Beth (Ryder). And we have two dueling and somewhat 'friendly' up'n'comers Lily and Nina. Fine, Lily's not so up'n'coming, but she's certainly coming at times. Bad. Sorry. This is a SERIOUS review of a SERIOUS movie.I digress. Nina wants the role-of-the-present, the Swan Queen, playing dual roles of the good white swan and her evil twin, the darkie. Oops. Sorry. Anyways, she has to fight tooth and nail – mostly teeth, which has bite – to get it. Is she really ready? Will director Thomas (Cassel) let her have it or will he prepare her to be perfect?Nina has multiple issues on her own, SEE: not just disturbed but delusional mommy, but when Meg (Kunis) from Family Guy shows upall hell breaks down for Nina. No wonder no one likes Meg.The question arises if Nina will make it to the final act and will her bloody aliments (or peers) stand in her way.Overall, I did like the look and feel of the movie. The score's pretty good and the acting is near perfect. And it's gruesome at times – yeah, I had to look away, even though it wasn't the grossest scenes I've witnessed. But there are really only two reasons to see this: the magnificent performance by Kunis and the very good job from Portman, especially in the last third – that was Portman at her best.Oh, okay, if you're a horny dude, you'll add a third reason: the sex scene between both those ladies. Blah, blah, did nothing for me, but if you into that sorta lesbo scene – it's really hot and heavy.for less than a minute.",8,0,4,24 December 2010
Men in Black 3," Don't Ask, Just Smile
","The Man in Men in Black 3 should've gone back in time to erase Part II, instead.For this third MIB film, this absolute make-up movie, à la Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, was the sequel the second one should've been. Mercifully, it did make-believe the second chapter didn't exist and only spoke of events in the original.Was this movie really necessary? Actually, I'm not the one asking that – I've heard that question multiple of times leading up to the release, but I will be the one answering. 90% yes and 10% probably. No is not the answer.While not perfect as it certainly had script and direction problems and though most of the jokes worked, there were a half of dozen scenes of un-fun silliness and overkill that made it tad cloudy. That said, it was a lot more fun than not and again, if this is the final one, it was a nice closureway more than that joke of a movie the middle segment was.And besides all that, I had a good time. The finale was enjoyable – although it really channeled (2006) Casino Royale's opening and the action was present and from the one cast member I wanted it the most from: Tommy Lee Jones. Obviously, it's not really him and that's apparent in most the movie considering it was Young K (Josh Brolin.) Oh, and by the way, he was not just spot-on, I never, ever thought that was anyone but a young Jones.The movie's opening 10 or so minutes were apparently more successful than all of previously released Lockout, and this leads a bad alien to go back in time to kill Men in Black agent K and in turn, agent/partner J back, as well, to save him. And, the world, of course.That's the best and easiest synopsis I can give, and of course, there's more to the story, but its best you just sit back and let the men entertain you.I don't want to give this my highest praise – it's doubtful this will land anywhere near my 2012 top ten list, but it's fun companion the first one. Nowhere as close to freshness or quality, but, again, like Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, it's a fun ride that should be seen following part one.(Notice how I didn't include part two in that statement. Neither should anyone else.)",8,6,10,3 March 2013
Scarface," Wake up to see his little friend
","I probably shouldn't have waited so long to see one of the most popular mobster and Al Pacino movies of all time, 'Scarface' (1983) for the first time last night. Enormously dated, 'Scarface' probably would've been more enjoyable during the 'Cuba' scare, tail end of the disco era and 'excess of the 80s' period. What 'Casino' and 'Goodfellas' had going for them, was they were both already period piece movies (and much more enjoyable than 'Scarface.') I realize 'Scarface' was a remake, and Oliver Stone and Brian De Palma seemed to want to take a new, 'updated' present day take on the older 'Al Capone' story line, but they didn't seem to make it timeless. Such as, for someone who's never seen 'Casino' or 'Goodfellas' and finally decide to view them, it would be as if they saw it for the first time in the 1990s. 'Scarface' pretty much had to be seen in/around 1983 to be completely enjoyed. Also, it might have been more shocking with all the F-bombs, violence and unpredictability of the rise/fall of a madman mobster. This is not to say it was a bad movie and Pacino did pretty good, though at times hard to understand and like most of his movies, he looks half-asleep throughout. It's three hours and even though any movie buff knows where it's going and what scenes to look for (amateur, rise, excess, fall, etc), it still was interesting to see what a lot of guys call a 'classic.' Recommended, but not over 'Casino' and 'Goodfellas.' Side note: I've already heard the line 'Say hello to my little friend,' 600x before, I couldn't help but wait the entire movie to see the scene that made Pacino's line so famous. Luckily, it was one of the times he appeared awake.",5,2,5,1 March 2009
Frost_Nixon," Frosty the Nixman
","As powerful of a performance from Frank Langella (I can see him accepting an Oscar, though I still hope it goes to Sean Penn for 'Milk') as Richard M. Nixon in 'Frost/Nixon,' one must not forget Michael Sheen's almost equally commanding portrayal of David Frost. It was suspenseful at times (admittedly, I have little background knowledge on the whole Watergate scandal, as I had little to go on with Ron Howard's other films: 'Apollo 13' and 'A Beautiful Mind'), had some punch in the dialogue, and a great score. I've heard the interviews were switched around for dramatic effect, and though disappointing, I understand how film (usually) has to have climaxes. That being said, already self-stated ignorance of the controversy, and as in the case with 'Apollo 13,' it was fairly predictable towards the end. But the good completely outweighs the bad, and the movie as good as it was, should be, at very least, viewed for Langella and Sheen's mesmerizing performances.",9,1,3,27 December 2008
Alien 3," The 25 Reasons to Avoid Alien³
","1. In 1992, no one heard you screamin the theatre.2. They didn't learn from Alien³ with Terminator 3, which ruined the notion of 'No fate but what we make' set forth in Terminator 2. Alien³ follows suit in just the first 10 minutes by tossing out all you cared about Aliens.3. Incredibly, I originally gave this movie 5 out of 5 stars. I was 18 then and 18 years later, I've grown up, opened my eyes and tried to remember what kinds of drugs I was inhaling back then.4. Mostly, I'll recommend the 'Uncut/Unrated/Unclothed' Special Editions of movies. In Alien³, you must skip it at all costs. An additional 31 USELESS minutes were added and in this 'special' edition, they mercilessly deleted the only thing the ending had going for it: the chest-burst.5. Speaking of useless minutes, in the so-called Special Edition there's a successful trap set for the alien. In one of the brainless ideas caught on screenplay paper, it's released. Thank God for editors for theatrical releases.6. While I thoroughly praised Aliens, I feel I was enormously harsh on the original Alien. After #3, I deserve to be shot for saying anything against the original.7. Ripley (Weaver) went from housewife to warrior with her G.I. Jane 'do...untilshe bellied over in what appears to be PMS cramps for the other 90% of the movie. Yeah. That's both tough and appealing.8. Who cares if your previous installment makes $131 million worldwide – which, by the way, was good for 1986the suits will always try and tear down the budget for a part III by turning the realistic alien creatures intocartoons?9. Alien³ had flat out hilarious alien scenes (when they're chomping away or in the distance.) Today we would call it CGI, in 1992, it was called animated. And poorly.10. Weaver only saw green ($$) for Alien³. She obviously decided she was in it for the money. Joke's on her: this was the lowest grossing of the first three. Hell, it barely reached $55 million, which, by the way, was still bad in 1992.11. The original premise of Alien³ was for it to be set on earth, and unbelievably, they released even teasers for that idea. Too bad they scrapped that better script for the 'lovely' locale of a prison planet with zero-chemistry, zero-brains and zero-depth inmates. Talk about expendable characters (SEE: plot of #1 and #2.)12. And WTF was with the series first (and completely irrelevant) sex scene? You cannot tell me prisoners make Ripley hot.13. Charles Dutton's character 'Dillon' was some kind of swearing, mean-spirited and rambling holy man. Sounds like someone had a Buddy Christ doll on his dashboard, hmmm?14. The poster reveals '3 times the suspense. 3 times the danger. 3 times the terror.' Affirmativeif you're multiplying 3 by zero.15. Spoiler: while the character of Ripley was very good in Alien and excellent in Aliens, she certainly took a backseat to Charles Dance's 'Clemens' who was the only redeeming character that had depth, one you rooted for, andwhat did they do? Kill him off abruptly and without thought.16. Admittedly, it did have good sets (for what it was) and it contained one of the best scenes in any movie: the alien all but attempting to kiss Ripley. It would be too much of a spoiler to report why, but suffice to say that was the only great 10 seconds of 8700 seconds of footage.17. 'The Company' is trying to get their paws on what they think are the last two aliens of the species. They need to Netflix part one again to remind them: there's a shitload of eggs still hanging out in a UFO on the original planet.18. Think what you will of Alien: Resurrection. That was the Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade of apologies for Alien³.19. When a character professes to be human, and that character stated he created androids in his image, they shouldn't label him in the credits as 'Bishop II' or any 'II' when he's supposedly the original.20. Spoiler: It still boggles my mind that they deleted the Ripley line 'For the last time' from the final product, and even the bloated special edition. Obviously, they wanted to leave this open for yet another sequel, but in reality, for fans of the series, we all know, it was, in fact, Ripley's last time.21. Thank God, this was only Director Fincher's first outing. Someone must've forgave him for Alien³ to allow him to make the superior films: Se7en, The Game, The Social Network and Fight Club.22. I'm aware Great Britain pretty much had its run of the world at one time, but how they conquered other worlds, such as this boring prison planet, is beyond me. (Okay, not getting my point across? Just try and understand half the words the brits in the movie are saying.)23. Ripley's character is afraid people will think she's crazy if she tells them there might be an alien stalking them in the shadows. Seriously? People, you can breathe on other planets. Is it really that much of a stretch that other organisms can, as well?24. This movie should be viewed by only the curious of what happened after Part II. The series should've ended with Part II as Part III didn't add hardly anything fresh, interesting, topical or suspenseful.25. Allow me to amend that: Don't be curious. Just don't watch this movie. Would you be curious to see what it feels to get your hand snapped in a rat-trap, or your ankle in a bear-trap? It's just common sense to stay away from something that will cause such agony. Alien³ is that kind of pain. Just avoid it.",2,1,4,20 January 2011
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Shadow Well Played
","I need to get something off my chest really fast and then we can get to the good stuff, or my positive critique: I hated the forest battle scene in Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows. I loathe slo-mo scenes in movies without explanation, as much as I hate CGI that takes center stage in films (i.e. Transformers.) And for 90% of this particular sequel, they craftily explained slo-mo, like the original Matrix did, so I was cool until Director Guy Ritchie took an unexpected, unexplained and unoriginal turn with showing a slowed down bombs-away scene amongst trees.WhewI'm glad I got that out of the way, because for the rest of the experience, I had a blast. A LOT more than Robert Downey Jr.'s first turn as the famous genius detective in 2009 remake: Sherlock Holmes.Holmes (Downey, Jr.) and newlywed Dr. Watson (Jude Law) work together to solve the alleged crimes of famed Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris) as bombs, murders and nations against nations take place in good ole 1891. Much like Dr. House and Dr. Wilson – which took from Sherlock's M.O., there's the typical reluctance, yet joy in their relationship.That's all incidental to an extremely fun adventure, great and believable cinematography, a smart and often hilarious script and another fantastic performance from Robert Downey, Jr. I love seeing him in 'the smartest person in the world' roles, although I was corrected today saying Sherlock's brother, Mycroft Holmes (Stephen Fry) is actually smarter. And, in addition to that person who knew more Sherlock's history that I did, another individual gave me the background today of a lot that happened in the books (and real-life history) that also appeared in this movie.Admittedly, I'm not a huge Holmes fan. I am a Robert Downey, Jr. fan and he led me to these two (and, hopefully more) films. He did create an enormously believable, fun, funny and adventurous already-established character brand new for me. And, though I appreciate them sticking to legend in this tale, I'm just happy with what I saw on screen and not have to watch countless hours of celluloid or read numerous books just to appreciate the two hours of film here.Honestly, there is not much more I can say about this project – without spoilers, that is, but that I had a roaring good time (outside the forest, that is) and that it's a tremendously enjoyable time with how brilliant both the character Sherlock was written and how great it was to see Downey, Jr. play him perfectly. I hope for a Part III, and pray they look past the so-so American box-office to justify it.",8,0,0,3 March 2013
Gremlins," Bright Light Blub Above
","Back when I was a little tyke, I was never allowed to see Gremlins because the little critters were deemed 'satanic' and it wasn't until I was in my 20s, or a decade or more past the movie's release, I finally saw it the first time.This re-viewing is only my second time and I have to say, I wasn't/am not the biggest fan, but I sure did like and admire the attention to detail, creativity, humor and the fact it's an roundabout remake (or, homage?) to one of my favorite monster movies, The Blob.The odd thing about this flick was that it started off as a comedy with tons of sight gags, cute and imaginative scenes and nods to multiple of movies, including producer Steven Spielberg's own movies. Butthen it turned dark, disturbing, actually gruesome and I'm shocked it only got slapped with a PG-Rating. Granted, in 1984, the PG-13 was just coming about, and though Rated-R would've been harsh and a box-office kill, PG was really generous.A little Mogwai creature is brought home by a comically horrible inventor father and given to his way-older-looking-than-he-was son (the actor was 20, but looked 30,) but with three simple rules: it cannot touch water, it doesn't like bright lights or the deathly sunlight and don't feed it after midnight. Naturally, the (supposedly) teen son breaks all of these rules and after the water multiples the Mogwai, or the better and cuter name for him: Gizmo and they're all fed after midnight, with the exception of Gizmo, they metamorphose into what my mother referred to as little Satan demons, and attack the town. It's up to man-boy, his equally older-looking teen girlfriend and Gizmo to stop the madness.Oh, those rules. While simple and a fun addition to this well-written script, the restrictions/instructions made no sense, with the exception of the bright light. Water is everywhere and in almost every – if not every, food and liquid. So what would you ever feed it? If they elaborated, like: Don't get water on or in it, but you can feed him dehydrated foods And about this midnight ruleWhich midnight? (They actually bring this flaw up in the sequel, but for this movie's sake...) Is this a curse and is only good for the time zone the Mogwai's in? And it's never, ever, brought up 'UNTIL WHEN.' Again, elaborate: Don't feed it after midnight, to say, six in the morning.I might be looking in too deep in a movie that was supposed to be half light/half horror, all entertainment, but I seriously couldn't get past those open-ended and vague rules.Okay, fine, I could get past them – eventually, and I did have a good time in this totally 80s movie. Overall, it's not a bad flick, and the invention of both Gizmo and the eventual Satan's little evil fiends, was worth the watch. Especially, cute little Gizmo. Recommended if you haven't seen it, or if you want to experience 80s nostalgia. (That is, if you were alive thenOh, I'll shut up now.)* * * Final thoughts: Many years following, and equally since, my only other viewing of this movie, I was with someone in a dark room and he flicked on the lights. Since my eyes needed and didn't get split second adjustment, without thought and only on instinct, I shouted out, but with a tiny voice: 'Bright lights! Bright lights!' He couldn't stop laughing and though he remembered it, I couldn't even recall where I got that line. Now, I appreciate it more after seeing it a second time.",7,0,1,10 October 2013
The Incredible Hulk," The Incredible Hunger
","Here's another movie I'll add to my 'I wanted to like more and, yet, continuously watch it' film list.By leaps and bounds, The Incredible Hulk (2008) is better than the Ang Lee's Hulk movie five years prior. But, it's still not great.The biggest problem I found was that the cast was in reverse. I loved the entire cast of the first movie, but thought the movie was so-so. Here, I disliked each choice for the well-known to the Hulk universe characters and wished they were swapped. At least, they got brave and smart enough to replace Bruce Banner, yet again, with Mark Ruffalo in The Avengers.I used to appreciate Edward Norton. I loved him in Fight Club, Rounders and American History X. But, the last two adaptations he took over, The Incredible Hulk and Red Dragon, he stunk. And bad.Oh, well. I try and get past him and Liv Tyler's lips, the ho-hum Tim Roth and misplaced (and normally great, himself) William Hurt. When I do move on from those bad choices, along with the wide-open plot holes, I can enjoy the movie.As I grew up on the Bill Bixby TV series and not the comics, I enjoy the obvious and welcomed TV series tie-ins. Such as: the theme song used, the reporter (note: his name) filming the outdoor University fight, Bixby on the tele, the exciting opening credit scene, the signature lines – albeit humoritized and of course, Lou Ferrigno's (second movie-Hulk) cameo. I enjoyed the HULK-OUT scenes a lot and most importantly, I loved the video-game ending. This is coming from someone who plays very few video games, but did play to completion: The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction on Xbox. The finale to this movie was almost verbatim the game and that was so much fun to watch on the big screen.After a rebooted look on how Dr. Bruce David Banner became the Hulk – so, FORGET the original 2003 movie, Banner's on the run and eventually, though questionably and unrealistically, comes 'home' to the USA in order to try and find a cure to his green alter-ego. Meanwhile, a military man wants to be the next super soldier and a great match to meet up with Hulk for theULTIMATE DESTRUCTION in NYC.This movie is NOT terrible by any means. It's pretty cool on how it ties in with the eventual Avengers mythos, years later and its special effects trump the previous movie. In addition, it's refreshing he doesn't grow to 6-stories in this installment.And even though they got the Hulk right even more in The Avengers, to date, 2013, they had very good special effects for the Hulk.Now, my gripes: I want to see less drama and more Hulk-outs. I want to see the Hulk change more. I want to see less dark scenes with the Hulk than trying to cover him up.Yes, I know they (probably mostly from Norton, from what I've read) wanted a more realistic and dramatic approach. Damnit, please just treat a superhero film like a superhero film and leave the art house crap for independent films.That all said, it's still enjoyable, when Hulk is on screen, especially the mid-daylight scene and the fantastic finale. (Though, what was with Betty stopping the killing? Finish him! Okay, okay, that was one of the plot holes)",5,0,1,4 May 2013
Mission: Impossible III," The III stands for: see it. SEE IT! SEE IT!!
","Sorry, I try and come up with a better headline for my reviews, but since Mission: Impossible III had the extreme unfortunate timing of being released almost immediately following Mr. Tom Cruise's rants, raving and couch jumping, practically no one saw not only the best of the franchise, but one of the best action movies I've seen.Though I did not grow up on the original Jim Phelps series, despite my father's futile attempts, I thoroughly understand the concept: Spy + Action. The first Mission: Impossible dealt ONLY with the spy part. The second movie, ONLY action. Finallythey got it right with Part III: they successfully blended both spy and action and(SPOILER don't read the final part of this paragraph if you haven't seen Parts I or III yet) the team lives, like they're supposed to! Unlike Part I, where 90% of the team diesIN THE FIRST 20 MINUTES and they improperly make the leaderJim Phelps, himselfa bad guy.At any rate, public opinion really should've been thrown out the window on this one. Seriously, I have no opinion on the Oprah couch rants or Tommy's battle with one-time-famous Brooke Shields (The Blue Lagoon) and it should NOT have any bearing on the quality of this nearly excellent film. It's like my fruitless protest of Chick-fil-A since its run by Mormons who like to close the doors on Sundays. I mean, they have great chicken sandwiches, no?A lot of the success of Part III has to be contributed to the soon-to-be-labeled-MASTER J.J. Abrams (Star Trek (2009).) They had faith in him to rejuvenate the series, and he would'veby a mile with the quality used in this film, if not for the judgmental public. Shame on you! You're missing out on (again) one of the best action movies ever.I'm all for people giving their educated opinions on topics, but when you dismiss one thing because of another, you're not giving it a chance. I'm not completely innocent myself, but I find more and more, I am opening my mind prior to watching a movie despite past bad performances or public outcries. For example, Sean Penn is not my favorite actors and he's a huge advocate, but that won't stop me from watching his movies to see if I'll ever be impressed. And, unbelievably, I have at times.I need to step off the pedal stool, and talk about the greatness here. We start at the end with an obvious object of (sorta ex-) spy Ethan Hunt's (Cruise) affection being tortured while Ethan can't do anything to stop it. Going back in (time in) the story we see how Ethan's adjusted well with his personal life after semi-retiring from spying. Unfortunately that (very quickly) goes south when he's called back to duty to rescue an old student of his, Lindsey (Keri Russell.)She was working on something called the 'Rabbit's Foot' that eeevil Owen (Hoffman) wants to obtain and sell. Ethan must scale the globe to solve the case of the missing rabbit's foot, appease his mean boss (Fishburne) and save his girlfriend.The movie's not in line with the Bourne franchise, but it's fairly close. Its fun, has great dialogue, a wonderful villain in (the ALWAYS impressive) Hoffman, has exciting action sequences, marvelous cinematography and the best score of the (first) three movies. Oh, and it's funny, thanks the always hilarious Simon Pegg.I understand the movie (unjustifiably) bombed, thanks, America, but I am glad Hollywood still have faith by bringing it back with a fourth installment in 2011especially now starring one of my favorites: Jeremy Renner.Put aside your feeling of Tom as a human – who are we to judge? – and just enjoy this hugely fun roller-coaster of adventure.",8,0,1,23 January 2011
Lucky Number Slevin," Hartnett Hammers a Big One
","Lucky Number Slevin was one of the only movies I've ever pressed stop when the movie's end-credits rolled and started over from the beginning and watched the entire feature in its entirety all over again. I was that impressed when I first watched it.Fast-forward four years andwell, not so much. Yeah, I still liked it (hence the 8/10 stars; I think my original opinion was 5/5.) It was still clever, had good acting, but it didn't have that sting that caused my original double-watching. I don't know what did it for me this timemaybe it was trying too hard to be smarter than it was, or that Ben Kingsley has lost a lot of respect from me over the years – A Sound of Thunder, anyone? And even though I hadn't seen Thunderbirds – I really can't bring myself to do so.Sure, Benny, sorry, SIR Benny, has been in a handful of excellent to good movies – Schindler's List, Shutter Island, to name a pair – but here, he just plain sucked. Lucy Lui – I always like her ('Hubba, Hubba, Hubba' – Payback) but here, she seemed to just play the part. Willis and Tucci – ditto.The only duo that stood out was Freeman and (oddly) Hartnett. I say oddly, because, after his premier in the way above average Halloween: H20, he's been as reliable as Keanu Reeves in film; you always know he is going to be terrible.The real winner here was the script. It's witty, fast paced, fun, original and a lot of the times, you will, in fact, do what I did: rewind and play again to see what you might have missed. I didn't see this in theatres, but I did for Fight Club, and I might have done just that for that movie.Aside from the movie's intro that jumps all over the place – though it's a great scene with Mr. Goodkat (Willis) in a wheelchair – we begin with Slevin (Hartnett, and incidentally I LOVE that name: Slevin) who's sporting a broken nose, a missing friend who he was supposed to stay with while visiting in NYC and a nosey neighbor, Lindsey (Liu) who does see more than he wanted her too.Not too long after Slevin's arrival, he's kidnapped via being mistaken for the friend he was supposed to meet. In nothing but a towel, he's taken downtown to meet a crime-lord, 'The Boss' (Freeman,) who explains he owes him money, but a hit on his nemesis, 'The Rabbi''s (Kingsley) son will do just fine.No matter how much Slevin tries to talk his way out, truthfully explaining he is not his friend – mistaken identity, etc – he gets further thrust into the battle between the two mobsters and the police all the while judging Lindsey and her 'investigation' of trying to help this complete stranger to her.It's a very well made movie with great dialogue, twists/turns and successfully takes itself from the realm of dark-comedy and quick wits to a more serious movie of revenge and retaliation. Despite my opening remarks, I highly recommend this little seen movie – especially if you like superhuman characters (Slevin) as much as I do. In fact, I think his only Kryptonite, though it was integral to the story, was the wildcard Lindsey. SEE IT!",8,1,2,4 September 2010
Requiem for a Dream," Requiem for a Nightmare
","I was in the mood for a real, honest 'feel-good' movie and was not disappointed in 'Requiem for a Dream.' There's heartwarming drama, true family ties, love, comedy and all around wholesome to be found in this uplifting tale.Of course, I'm just kidding. Despite one character taking uppers, this serves up the downers, in truckloads.Four characters in various degrees of drug usage and stages of narcotics spiral out of control, and yet, I felt the movie serves up the extreme consequences only a few go through. Granted, I am not a drug user, nor do I associate people that live this kind of existence, so what do I know? It just seemed to me, in a very short time, less than a year, these people went from (sort-of) real world to near death or worse.The movie begins with a son scaring his mother by removing her TV. My first reaction was he was trying to help her from her television addiction. On the contrary, it was to sell it for the x amount of times in order to score drugs with his friend. They, with the addition of the son's girlfriend come up with a 'surefire' way to make it big and out of the life-path they've set themselves on. Hmmm, without giving anything away, I wonder if their slam-dunk plan will work. Meanwhile, Mom gets her dream come true: guest starring on the one and only show on TV (really? There was never anything else on?) To prepare, she inadvertently gets hooked on uppers her careless doctor prescribes. Even her son tells her 'Say no to drugs.'Overall, I liked the movie that doesn't just also tell the audience to avoid drugs, but shows why in very original and unique ways. Great performances, especially Burstyn (Mom.)Unfortunately, the reason I didn't give it a higher rating was though the story was predictable, the results seemed somehow sped up. Also, the music, which was sometimes good, most times was so overbearing/such a distraction to what was going on or the dialogue spoken. And finally, as unrealistic (again, I'm not a druggie, so I'm mostly assuming) as their lives seemed to turn out, they made the rest of the world crazy, too. Blind doctors, electric shock treatments to cure prescription woos and a station that runs a 'game show/self-help' program 24 hours a day, 7 days a week marathon on 3 simple principles of 'being a winner.' I know those exist, but mercifully, they're only usually in 30 minute 3AM time slots.",6,1,2,12 September 2009
Captain Phillips," Had My Phil
","Sorry, I know it's not real, but I'd rather watch the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie again than the 'true' pirates movie, Captain Phillips.Now, this is nothing against the real people who went through this or any others that have gone through a similar experience, but frankly, I was all-but bored. And perplexed.A ship containing millions, or more, worth of merchandise and is 'guarded' by men with barely a hand gun, a few hoses and a walkie-talkie is just plain bad management. Probably things have changed with more and more pirate attacks, but I'm either too lazy or too uninterested to research that. All I know is what they showed me in thisincredibly dull take over film.And why call the movie 'Captain Phillips?' Is he supposed to be such an unbelievably deep and/or heroic person? Let's see what he did in this movie (this synopsis does contain some spoilers):Captain Rich puts his crew on a drill. They get attacked. Cap manages to get them out of trouble. They're attacked, more successfully this time. Cap hides his men, gets kidnapped and needs some rescuin'.Granted, some of that is pretty good. Amazing? No. I've seen more heroics from other 'based on a true stories' and even some of those are just dramatic football films.But, the scenery is good, the acting isn't great, but acceptable and it was a well-shot film. It just barely held my interest and always puzzled me throughout on why the film was called his name.* * * Final thoughts: Sure, the lead pirate, Barkhad Abdi, received an Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Role. Did he earn it? Hell no. He was so just mediocre in this, I think the Academy just didn't watch more than five movies this year so they had limited options. Oh, and incidentally, if he didn't shut that mouth, mine was going to open, but only to vomit. Damn, no one wants to see all your teeth and entire jaw!",4,1,3,19 January 2014
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Jar, Annie & 'I' Still 2-D After All
","A Necessary EvilLooks like I agree with myself from 2 years ago. I reviewed Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace when it was released in 2012 in 3-D (see my original review following.) They were supposed to convert the original six in 3-D and re-release each 1-year apart in theatres, so I figured this would be the best way to finally tackle my reviews of them. That idea fizzled, as did this re-release. No wonder, the movie is mostly awful and even when there are bright spots, such as a great performance from Liam Neeson and some beyond-1999 great FX, Georgie Lucas loves to remind us this is HIS movie and he'll ruin any which way he can.This movie is, indeed, a necessary evil. My plan this time around was to watch all 6, on BluRay and from my roommate's projection equipment and on his 150' screen. I cringed all the way through this and all it did was make me yearn to get through the first three to get to the real movies.What I wrote below has not changed. What has changed is my vow to never see this movie again, even if I have a STAR WARS marathon in mind. I will just stick with originally worked: IV-VI.(From February 12, 2012)You know that anti-bullying ad: 'It Gets Better'? Well, they should've hired that creator to run the advertisements for Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace. (3/10 Stars)Because after this installment, it does. Little by little. Inch by inch. Okay, make that a galaxy-wide time-frame, but if you can stick it through the first couple of episodes and wait for the additional cast that will send this franchise into hyper-drive, then you'll be content.I digress; we're talking here about Star Wars Episode I: The Pod Race. Will Lil Annie, soon to be Anakin, soon to be Darth Vader and finally the chosen one, bring balance to the Force with lines such as 'Yippie!' and 'I'm a person!' and 'Are you an angel – they live on moons of lego?' and 'Mom, you said that the biggest problem in the universe is no one helps each other' and 'Don't count on it, slimeball!'I don't blame him; I blame the horrid director/writer who should've applied to be Stan Winston's successor instead of thinking of dialogue worse than the source material he based this Space Soap Opera on. Yes, I'm bashing Georgie. I think with the money he has that makes Bill Gates jealous, he can take it.Oh, and I haven't even gotten to Georgie's other bad decision: Jar Jar Binks. And I assure you, I won't waste too much time on one of the worst characters in film history. That's already an established fact. So, in lieu of beating a dead Gungan, I'll tell a brief story:A Long Time Ago in a City Not Too Far Away, I originally saw Episode I and a couple of weeks later, my dad had time for his first viewing so I took him. Maybe twenty minutes in, Jar Jar makes his screen debut and my dad leans over to me, to ask: 'Who is that annoying character? I don't like him!' To which, I spat back: 'Get used to him. He's in practically every single scene until the end.' My dad did not look pleased.At any rate, it doesn't get much better, within this film, that is. Beyond Lil Annie's annoyance – and believe me, he would be the number one Star Wuss if not for Jar Jar, there's further bad dialogue, acting and the pacing is atrocious. If the 45-minute Pod Race – that's ONE SCENE – isn't bad enough, the movie moves as slow as the famous words at the beginning. Its clear Georgie Boy had a 30 minute story to tell and stretched it past two hours. And you'll feel every Midi-Chlorian until the surprisingly decent finale.In fact, that's my highest praise of the movie, aside from some very good special effects. If you can wade through Naboo and Queen Amidala's cut lip and laughable voice, you'll be greeted with the fantastic, duel lightsabering Darth Maul – the one stand out character that you'll cheer for, even if he's on the Dark Side. His fighting two Jed-Is along with a mildly entertaining space battle is worth waiting for. That is, if you can ignore the other things happening at that time, such as Lil Annie's constant need to FORCE a headache on the movie-goer or the battle of the Gungans – because, YES, any time they're on screen, spitting or not, they're absolutely maddening.Lest I forget, it's in Barely 3-D now in theatres. Don't waste your time. The 3-D adds ZERO to this experience. But, don't worry. Episode II is a huge improvement as is III over II. And so onIt will get better.",3,5,11,12 February 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," The Top Twenty-Eight Things I Learned From Twilight 4a: Part 1
","1. And God said: 'Since AIDS didn't teach you, I bestow 'Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part 1' upon you.' 2. The cast's acting ability is equivalent to a possum under attack. 3. Shouting out 'You did THIS!' to a man who recently impregnated his wife isn't just insultingit's obvious. 4. While playing chess, it is appropriate to gleefully proclaim: 'I win!' like a five-year-old verses the oh-so-ancient 'checkmate.' 5. According to the morals of somewhat-writer Stephanie Meyer, it is acceptable to kill humans as long as you're in the healthy position of playing both judge and executioner. Long-live mormons. 6. If it was previously okay for someone over 100 to woo someone under 18-years-old, then I guess the same could be done for a teen to an 18-minute-old infant. 7. 'Twilight' contains as many vampires as the Republican Party contains Christians. 8. Within 3-seconds of the start time, Jacob rips off his shirt. Release the horny and lonely 50-year-old moms! 9. Werewolves tend to get sick at the sight of blood, apparently. 10. You know you have script problems when George Lucas, himself, has dialogue suggestions. 11. The original subtitle of 'Breaking Wind' was questionably rejected. 12. Soap Operas, left and right, are being cancelled and yet this has a theatrical release? My apologies, World. 13. Mercifully, to cut some costs on lighting, the moon is full in every night shot, despite the continuity of scenes. 14. If this is the Anti-Abortion-Advertisement it screams, I will pull the hanger myself. 15. More got accomplished in the 16 Republican debates than in two draining hours here. 16. I've heard the same bed that breaks in the movie during Edward and Bella's sex scene happens in the book. Big deal; I used to call that: Tuesday Night. 17. Worried your unborn child might become a demonic offspring? Turn to Yahoo on an Apple laptop for all your answers. 18. Who knew a pack of talking dogs could be this funny, outside of Pixar's 'Up'? 19. The Mayans calendar has been recalculated to narrow the end of days to 2/11/12. In a completely unrelated story, 'Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part 1' is being released on video that same day. 20. Wincing as hard as you can and uttering the line: 'Why can't you see how perfectly happy I am?' isn't the most believable pose to convince someone they're good in bed. 21. Finally, a movie I can agree actors deserved a $30 million paycheck. Isn't that the going rate for a soul? 22. I believe in Guilty Pleasures.

The Perks of Being a Wallflower," The Perks of Watching This
","are countless.The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a powerful and wonderful film. The performances are top notch, the score great, the songs awesome and themes were heartbreakingly real and deep.John Hughes cornered the high school market in the 1980s. Were they necessarily real visions of pre-real world youths? Sometimes, but for the most part, they were comical views. Perks physically transported me back years to my days there. Hell, it enhanced my eyes of the surroundings back then.Introverted freshman Charlie is desperate for friendship in his new High School surroundings. Sure, he gets some from a remarkable teacher, but he's looking for someone his own age.He does get that, sorta: 3 years older in the form of a great duo of Patrick and Sam. Anyone, including myself, would yearn for such great friends. Patrick's way more outgoing than I was, and that would've attracted me to him tremendously and Sam's so cool without even knowing it.But, there are deeper messages here, clues to unravel on why Charlie's so quiet and distant. It's heartbreaking learning more about both his past and present.It took me all year and within 9 days of the next year to find my first five star 2012 film. I loved this movie, from the absolute first shot to the last. I cried, I laughed, I enjoyed life while not even participating in the events in the film. I felt there, I was Charlie.This movie is near perfection. The acting of all around was excellent with the notable performances of Logan Lerman who owned Charlie, Ezra Miller as flamboyant, funny and fantastic Patrick and Emma Watson who was so good as Sam, it made me completely forget she was ever in the Harry Potter films. (And that's a major positive to me.)When you can see yourself in these eyes, when you can clinch your fist and want to fight like these characters, you know you have the highest quality of acting. In one scene, one character needs to get out there and defend his friend against punk kids. I would be dead inside, if I didn't put myself in his shoes and want to pound such evil.Lerman's Charlie was so real, so incredible, it would be a crime not to just hand the Best Actor Oscar over to him.Aside from the acting, the cinematography, editing and direction were supreme. And the soundtrack was one of the best I've ever heard and I will be buying it shortly. As I will the BluRay of the film once available.I can't provide enough praise to give this film justice. Rarely will a movie impact me like this, and if no other 2012 films I have yet to see don't come close to this, I will sleep comfortably. This is a gem to appreciate and absorb.",10,2,4,23 December 2012
10 Cloverfield Lane," Room 2: Out-Break
","As much as I liked the 'first' Cloverfield – one of only two or three found-footage films that actually worked, this one topples that. What an incredible twist to that Monsters Attack film. I am aware this didn't start off as a sorta spin-off, and for that, I was weary up front. It did start off interesting, got better, slowed a bit with the typical 'fun' captive scenes and thencontained one of the most heart- pounding, thrilling and satisfying endings I have seen in a very long time.I'm jumping ahead. Basically, Dan Conner may or may not have been a paranoid kidnapper, but he's still keeping Ramona Flowers against her will in an underground bunker with neighbor and 'survivor' Not-Ryan Reynolds. Story has it, the above ground has been under attack, first with deadly gases and followed by a ground invasion. Is it true? Should the damsel in distress leave the bunker and safety for the unknown? Does she have a choice?Already loved Mary Elizabeth Winstead (the aforementioned female) and she did NOT disappoint here. But, the winner goes to John Goodman's fantastic performance as the captor. I would love him to be nominated for this role. Well shot and the intensity grows and grows and keep multiplying until the great conclusion I mentioned. Do you need to see 2008's Cloverfield to get this? Not really. I mean, I would still recommend it on its own and it couldn't hurt to even put you more on edge here, but not 100% necessary. Loved this movie and not since last year's similarly toned and plotted Ex Machina have I felt this way while watching a film. In fact, these two films would be an absolute perfect double feature.***Final thoughts: In the recommendation of a double feature of Ex Machina and 10 Cloverfield Lane, it probably would be best to leave out the original Cloverfield in that scenario's movie night. Again, I would recommend the 2008 Giant Monster movie, it just wouldn't mesh with these two movies. If you take anything from the above review, I would highly consider this duo for a great sci-fi night of suburb thrillers.",9,1,5,8 May 2016
The Finest Hours," The Imperfect Storm
","More like: A Boring Storm.I kinda feel bad for saying that, as this is supposedly 'a true story' and the actors and crew really did all they could to keep us educated and entertained. But, dang it, this movie is probably 30 minutes too long. So much could've been cut and make it thoroughly more interesting and heartfelt.I'm actually surprised this came out in the Dead-Movie Month of January. This had Oscar-bait written all over it. So many bland characters, so many cliché scenes and so incredibly predictable – even if you didn't know the 'true' storybut if you like this sort of search and rescue with the backdrop of a 50s romance, by all means. Unfortunately, due to its enormous padding and unoriginality, it's thoroughly not recommended. Too bad.",3,5,10,27 November 2016
The Sound of Music," The Sound of Greatness
","The Sound of Music was my choice this year to replace the boring super bowl game.Every year I pick one movie (or sometimes a couple) to watch while everyone else on planet Earth watches the super bowl. I thought, after previously buying this on BluRay and having it for some time without having watched it on BluRay, I thought it just perfect for that Sunday, February 2nd. (Oh, and in case you were wondering, my other yearly tradition was fulfilled earlier in the day when I watched Groundhog Day on BluRay.)Despite my intentions, i.e. replacing the 'manly man' sports programme with a musical, this movie was an absolute JOY to watch. Every second, every frame, every scene, every songfrom beginning to end had be on the edge of my seat. (And yeah, I did sing out loud the songs.) Now, this is only my second time ever seeing this and I'll get into my first time many, many years ago later. So, it was almost like me seeing it for the first time, again.It did help that the BluRay transfer was nothing short of a miracle. It made it look pristine, brand new and possibly even better than its initial release nearly 50 years ago. (I say possibly since I wasn't around for its first run.) Every inch of the screen (and mind you, I don't even have a TV that can give me the best BluRay offers – 720dpi) was immaculate.But, then again, so was the movie. I am not one to look for flaws in this movie, but an hour in, I had to pause myself and think: this movie has no flaws. Everything worked. To put it in 2014 terms: Everything *was* awesome.That said, I will say this, despite me granting this 5/5 stars (or 10/10 on IMDb's scale) and calling it nothing short of a masterpiece, I guess there was one tiny bit where it slowed down, towards the end, when it got serious. It had to, so it's not necessarily a flaw, per se, but it also didn't necessarily mesh with the previous nearly 3 hours.Honestly, it pains me to say one word against this fine piece of art. It was so magical, so wonderful, even the thoughts going through my head as I write this are filled with joy. I loved this movie. The music, the acting, the surprises and the humor – and amazingly, there was a lot more than you would expect, especially jokes that hold up today.If you haven't heard the story by now, it was a story of a nun that didn't belong until she was assigned the status of governess of seven children of a widowed father pre-WWII in Austria. There, she warms their hearts, unfreezes the father's and discovers herself. We're just blessed to go along with her journey.I hope you've seen this movie before. If you have, see it again. If you haven't, you must see it. Above all else, to either group of individuals, go out and buy a BluRay player (assuming you haven't already) and then buy this movie. Even cold. Buy it on BluRay and relish in the beauty and wonder of The Sound of Music.* * * Final thoughts: I was born 9 years after this movie's release. Hard for me to believe that as I now think about it. I grew up, or at least into mid-teens, listening or hearing the songs from the soundtrack which I loved. I didn't necessarily associate the songs from the movie, untilI cannot remember when, but our local movie theatre chain here in Phoenix, AZ, Harkins, played this movie for twenty-five cents as some kind of anniversary of the movie theatre chain. (Prices from when both the movie and chain opened.) I thought: well, I've never seen it, it's considered a masterpiece and why not view it on the big screen for the first time?Almost immediately in the movie, during the opening credits, they play an instrumental medley of multiple of the movie's songs. I sat up instantly thinking 'Oh! I know that song! I didn't know it was in this!' and repeated that thought a couple more times. It was then I was thoroughly excited to see the rest of the movie.While the movie, songs, etc, didn't disappoint, the print did. It was an original print filled with scratches, a pink tint – many discolored scenes and cuts. There was an unintentionally laugh out loud scene for me when Julie Andrews was on one side of the room and suddenly the movie jumped to her on the other side. I remember thinking: 'I didn't know they could teleport way back then!'I gave the movie the strong benefit of the doubt (of the original print in the projection booth.) I really did like it a lot.Fast-forward maaaybeee two decades to two months ago today. I watched it for the second time. I don't want to say it was the perfect quality of the BluRay disc, but I fell in deep love with this movie more than I can express in these words above.The gorgeous disc did help, that is. And not every BluRay comes out half as good as this one did.So, please, if you're even remotely interested in this, or want to reclaim that initial feeling you got from your childhood seeing this, BUY THIS ON BLURAY. You will not regret it.",10,2,8,2 April 2014
The Expendables 2," They're all BackAnd Better
","Anyone who still subscribes to the flawed theory: Sequels are NEVER better than the originals, better leave the room now.Much like other retro movies like Freddy Vs. Jason, The Expendables 2 has to be refreshing to all those who grew up in the 1980s with these muscle men. This should've very well been the first movie in the series, but since that's neither here, nor there, allow me to exclaim: I fraking loved this movie, and I wasn't even the biggest fan of these guys back then.This is the Piranha 3D of 2012: the movie never lied about what it was all about and gave us all everything we wanted. Such as a straight-line plot, hilarious lines, great action and quick-to-the-point scenarios. This movie absolutely started with a bang, never let up and got progressively better until the outright 1980s/1990s fantastic climax. I cannot express how much I had a blast during this.And this is coming from someone who loves originality and unpredictable films, of which this was neither. Again, this movie provided everything to satisfy a decades old combo-pack of action stars. As stated, this reminded me a lot of Piranha 3D: Everything that was foreseen for people who grew up loving those types of movies was granted.I wanted to see the stars Jason Statham, Sylvester Stallone and Randy Couture show their awesome moves (namely, my favorite action star of the entire cast, Statham – he was awesome) and co-stars, like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis and Jet Li all kick ass, and they did. Further, I've never been a Jean-Claude Van Damme fan, but was welcoming his signature kick. And this, I proclaim, is my very first Chuck Norris film I've seen. Despite him not front-running the show, it's still my first (and enjoyable) experience of his on screen presence.When the only thing that disappointed me was the extreme lack of Jet Li and no Jackie Chan invited to the party – I mean, c'mon guys! – then, I know the positives surely outweighed the measly negatives.The plot – ha, this is a purposely retread of all of those involved's past movies – is fairly simple: to settle a debt, the D-Team must retrieve an object, lose it and seek revenge and redemption and become heroes.I probably would've hated such a clichéd movietwenty-thirty years ago. And I usually did. But, when you make it such a tongue-in-cheek and fun ride such as this, you can't help but smile and enjoy the trip.Recap: The Expendables (2010): 2/5 Stars. The Expendables 2 (2012): 4/5 Stars. Hmm, not all sequels are inferior.And even with the inevitable The Expendables 3, and there's nothing I can do to stop that, I hope they take the lessons learned here: Continue to have fun making it, take nothing serious and remember Jackie Chan's still alive!",8,1,2,21 January 2013
Source Code," Inception Part II: The Better Source
","Yeah..I know. I know. I'll get heat for this one, but Source Code is so much better than and the movie I thoroughly expected from Inception.Was it the hype for Inception I heard for the two months it took me to see that after it was released? Eh, I can get past that. And Inception wasn't a bad movie, but it didn't impress me than this admittedly smaller, but more entertaining sci-fi thriller.Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) awakes on a train headed towards Chicago and he's unsure how he got there. (I can relate, but mine's usually an unfamiliar beduh) And within eight minutes, the whole thing explodes! And that's just within the first eight minutes of the movie!Next, Colter awakes in a pod with Colleen Goodwin (played the always fantastic Vera Farmiga) asking him questions on a screen while telling him his 'frivolous' inquires on where he is/why he's there are irrelevant and he's wasting time. Well, if you didn't know how you got on a train one minute and in a pod the next and you thought you were supposed to be serving your country in Afghanistan – oh, I left that part out: he's a soldier – then you might be a bit puzzled yourself.And repeat. He's constantly sent back to the train scene where his 'mission' is to find out who's the mad bomber within eight minutes so Colleen and her military gang can prevent another attack – one that's actually in downtown Chicago. Only, we've sent a human to do a computer's job, à la: the Robocop syndrome. He falls for Christina Warren (played by – again – the always fantastic Michelle Monaghan – I wish we could see more of her), a woman Colter keeps seeing once he's 'magically' transported back onto the train while he's inhibiting a body of a victim who's fate will be sealed (yet again) in eight minutes.There's a lot more, and it would be hard to write a synopsis without blatant spoilers. Suffice to say, expect a lot of twists and on the edge of your seat suspense, EVEN when they supposedly solved the 'problem.' Literally, even though the movie could've ended 15 minutes before the finale, I was still on edge because humans always seem to mess things up, even when they 'won.' And lo, I was thoroughly surprised and pleased with the conclusions.Much like Moon, Director Duncan Jones made such a 'small' film seem so large. I can absolutely see this making only a third of what Inception made, and that's okay. Avatar made TRILLIONS (not really, but anything over $100 million was unjustified) and that doesn't make that anywhere near the top of hardly anyone's best movies lists. I can absolutely see this movie making my own top ten of 2011 (at least.) And it's so short that, it's an easy movie to watch repeatedly.Strictly for entertainment purposes only, Source Code, a more serious and more relevant (for today's time) Groundhog Day experiment, is a must-see. The performances of the two leading ladies were very good and Jake – eh – was still good, but the idea, originality, twists, fun and absolute suspense make this a train ride everyone should be all-aboard. (Dang, that was cheesy. Hope that doesn't make the poster and deter viewers)",9,3,4,10 April 2011
Skyfall," Fallen, Indeed
","And the Bond reboot trilogy comes to a close. Although, I believe they might have left it open to another sequelI really don't know what to think, immediately, at any rate, of Bond's latest, Skyfall. Well, of course, I'm happy to see him (and Daniel Craig, my favorite Bond) back on the big screen – IMAX, no less – after such a long and unnecessary absence.The reason for my hesitation was because I was disappointed in the poor script, plot holes, and terrible villain – although I should be proud of what I think they were portraying him to be. In addition, there were so many references to the older Bond flicks that I just re-watched or watched for the very first time recently that I just didn't care about. Injunction with the seven or eight attempts at homage, all they talked about was the same boring cliché Lethal Weapon kept reminding us of: 'We're getting too old for this sh|t.'Enough! I am a James Bond fan, for the most part, and I put him in the same category as a super-hero. I don't want to see him fall from the sky, get shot, complain about cramps, want to move into a retirement home or act human. Sure, it makes it more realistic, but Jason Bourne was pretty banged up for most of his trilogy and he didn't make us listen to all his wines or grunts. Ironically, Judi Dench's M was tough as ever and she's twice Bond's age.Regardless, take out the meager writing – including the most obvious twists, the crying and one-too-many homage's – even the so-so title song was one, it was a very decent action film that started off with a fantastic chase scene, had a great silhouette shot and included one of the best cinematographers in the series. I also enjoyed the Bond Girls, albeit they were fairly absence throughout. The lesser of the two girls in relation to screen time, Sévérine (Bérénice Marlohe) has to be one of the best looking Bond Girls of all time.Bond's chasing a man with a drive, hard drive, that is, containing the secret identities to all MI6's agents and inadvertently gets 'dead' for several months. When the sh|t hits the fan, Bond pulls himself out of semi-dead mode to aid M find the computer hacker while she's dealing with, ah-hem, politics to continue funding the spy organization.Things get personal and hit home for our heroes and once again, our Bond villains always stop short of either killing Bond or escaping and giving Bond more than adequate time to basically reload or recover.That last part is a Bond film signature, and as much as they tried to make this the most realistic, I found myself pointing to the screen to the most obvious exits or actions the villains should be doing while waiting for Bond to catch up. They might as well be tripping over some bushes at Camp Crystal Lake while Jason Voorhees slowly walks to them.I'm really not trying to dog the film that much, and it was a slight improvement over Quantum of Solace, but it was a letdown from what I expected. I still love Craig (and his Dumbo ears) as Bond, and Judi Dench as M, and I will be excited for the next chapter, but I hope they get away from all those Bond references and just start making individual Bond movies again.Forthis movie truly made the exceedingly superior Casino Royale look like just the first part of a reboot trilogy. With all that came to pass, all the way to the finale of Skyfall, it finally looks like the series came in full circle. So much so, that the movie basically felt like it immediately preceded Dr. No.In regards to that, I praise them and I yearn for an energized and original Bond to come next.Side Note: The movie touched on one topic close to my heart and opened the door wide for people like me. I'm being very general here, because I don't want to spoil anythingbut, I was shocked and pleased with Bond's reaction and statement while tied to a chair and being interrogated, sort of, by the villain. Way to go. I'm glad this Bond film has an open mind. I just don't want to hear the backlash from the general public.",5,8,18,10 November 2012
50 First Dates," His First Dates with Drew
","True, I'm not an Adam Sandler fan, but 50 First Dates was recommended to me by a friend, so I obliged. Mercifully, Drew & and the Great 50th State of Hawaii saved this movie.She was fresh, wonderful, funny, beautiful and carried this repetitive idea of a short-term memory girl and her relived days, every day through to the end. Granted, there's been better movies with the same idea, such as Groundhog Day, but this was a touching love story of a player (Sandler) who woos the girl who can never remember him when she awakes. It's a barely recommendation.",5,3,5,1 December 2012
The Hangover," One of the Most Realistic Vegas Movies Ever
","No offense to Seth Rogen, Johan Hill, Paul Rudd, Will Farrell, et al, but what a refreshing sight it was to see a buddy/bromance movie without them starring in it. The guys, especially Galifianakis, in The Hangover all could hold their own and crack me up. Each had their own depth, each was interesting, though somewhat clichéd, and each I rooted for, despite their downfalls. What could've been the same ole, same ole bachelor party in Vegas movie turned out surprisingly original, funny, and at times, a suspenseful mystery. Three guy friends (and a future brother-in-law) head off to Vegas for the said bachelor romp two days prior to the groom, Doug's wedding. After a night they did forget, and loosing Doug, they must put the pieces together to find him and return him to LA and his bride. Along the way, they, of course, encounter the kooky characters you would expect from this type of comedy, as well as, a rooster, a tiger and Tyson, oh my. Being over-hyped prior to its release had me worried, as did the Tyson cameo, but both the movie and the former boxer delivered, tenfold. Even the movie, itself, was well shot. Vegas is shown as it really is: consistent construction – though they were as updated as they could be, still some unfinished projects in the film, such as Westgate at Planet Hollywood, have already been completed. Still, it was the most realistic footage of Vegas I've seen. Sure, it had some stock shots, but mostly it was real. All the men were hilarious, and it was nice they were given depth. But the bearded third wheel, Alan, really stood out with trueness and sympathy. Instantly one of my all-time favorite Vegas movies and I could see this becoming a future cult classic.",8,1,2,1 December 2012
Ghost," The Ghost Whisperer
","Admittedly, I had a grudge against this movie. But, not until the following year (1991) when the Oscar Nominations were read. This got nominated for Best Picture and not Pretty Woman? And not just that, very few eyes were on, what I considered (and still do) a masterpiece, Pretty Woman and more on Ghost? It would be years until I saw this again.I was sorry when I finally revisited this in the mid-1990s because, I had to concur: this was a well made film. Great in a lot of areas, even. And I've loved it since.Not so much a spoiler, thanks to the name of the movie, but Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze, RIP, in yet another masterful performance) dies fairly quickly into the movie and becomesthe title character. He's not transported either up high or down below and must learn the ways of the ghost. Mercifully, with the help of (the fantastic character, and Oscar winning Whoopi Goldberg as) con-artist (?) Oda Mae Brown, Sam can both reconnect with his widowed lover and catch the bad person who put him in this purgatory.The movie does work in mysterious ways. It's highly hilarious and touching. It's suspenseful and deep. It contains a triple pleasure: a great soundtrack, score and cinematography. And with it's 'on the surface' clichéd characters, the actors bring much more to the table. Even though everyone, including the 'Subway Ghost,' acted their best and made their roles their own, Academy Award winning Whoopi Goldberg shined the brightest in here, despite her blatant racism. I still laughed and loved her throughout her (sadly) short time on screen. I have always been a Whoopi fan, but here, I believe she brought her best out.This very positive review comes from someone who doesn't even like ghost stories. This one felt many more times different than the others I've seen and I will watch this many more times than the typical modern day and boringly predictable paranormal films.Side Note: While I did not downgrade the movie because of the following: I have to say, this movie made me thoroughly dislike Tony Goldwyn. Granted, he played his slimy role as he was told or felt his character needed to be seen. But, he's literally like a magnet to my magnet when I see him on screen. He's the one thing I cannot look at when watching this movie and I haven't liked him since. Just a personal preference.",9,1,2,28 April 2013
Iron Man 3," Three Stars
","Damn. I hope this doesn't happen to Man of Steel. I hope they don't frontload it with comedy and dedicate only 20% of the movie to action/adventureespecially in a SUPERHERO movie.Some movies, particularly comic book adaptations, don't put the title in the beginning of the movie, and when you finish with Iron Man 3, you'll know why. Okay, I'll just tell you: the original title had to be TONY STARK, because the film's trailer showed you Iron Man more than the film itself.That's kind of unfair, albeit only slightly exaggerated. But, for the love of Marvel, it would have been nice to see an action-packed Iron Man movie. Hell, I would've settled for an adventure with Iron Man flying around.To the movie's credit, it was pretty dang funny. I laughed out loud and enjoyed Robert Downey Jr. once again as Tony Stark – when he wasn't a baby, that is. And when the few moments of action did appear, it was pretty exciting, though nothing spectacular.Further, to the film's recognition, were the excellent special effects. It's always fun to see Tony's virtual reality toys.Sleep deprived and sometimes stupid Tony challenges a terrorist to a fight when his best bud gets hurt in an 'attack.' For the majority of the rest of the movie, Tony plays detective to track the most obvious of villains and connections since his first movie in 2008.The screenplay lacked an additional couple of necessary re-writes as the plot holes were everywhere. In addition, and as mentioned, the film holds no surprises whatsoever; whenever a scene appears – and you know exactly when that will happen – and we're supposed to be shocked, it comes out as more of an eye roll. And furthermore, the motivations were questionable, the doors opened by the script were barely closed and if they were, the answers were too easy and the cast, with the exception of Downey Jr (of course) and an incidental child, had almost zero chemistry or charisma.And while the humor was incredible at points, and had some good old fashioned references for people my age, it got a little overzealous with the slapstick. Namely from one character, whom I cannot reveal as that's way too much a spoiler. But, then again, you will see almost every twist coming, so you'll know soon enough who was just funny enough for a 5-year-old.Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate the movie, but I came to see an IRON MAN movie and got something that spent far too much time with one-liners, a mostly suitless Stark and was just barely elevated from the disappointing Iron Man 2. And the first installment was fairly cliché and predictable as well, but it was Robert Downey Jr. fresh and the best he's been in any of the films, including The Avengers.Overall, it's a funny, sometimes downright hilarious, film, but sometimes I would actually rather watch a superhero movie with, I don't know, the title character spending more time on the screen than his alter ego wisecracking and acting weak. If I wanted to watch a video with a whiny character with flawed traits, I'll just go to YouTube. It's cheaper, anyways.IRON MAN 3 (3/5 Stars)",5,2,5,4 May 2013
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Doc Ock Vs. Doc Indy
","Not only is Raiders of the Lost Ark my favorite adventure of all time – almost 20 years later, nothing has come remotely close, it is a masterpiece in film-making. That is NOT a word I use regularly, and for those who know me, know how critical I am with films. Suffice to say, I mean it when I say MASTERPIECE.Everything worked in this movie. Sound, score, acting, believability – for its subject matter, humor, suspense, cinematography, twists. Simply stated: this is a must see for all ages, all creeds, all humans.Did they even know what they had when they made the first Indiana Jones adventure? Did audiences know what once in a lifetime experience they were watching back in 1981 or take this for granted? I know I probably would have – if I had seen it in theatres at that time. (Side Note: I can't say for certain that I did or did not see this in first run theatres, I was only seven and my family barely went to one or two movies a year – if we were lucky.) The movie starts off with a bang – Dr. Indiana Jones is attempting to obtain an ancient artifact for a museum, but must first pass a series of tests, including who to trust, in 1936 South America. It's a famous opening segment accompany the famous Indy Vs. the Boulder scene and it sets the tone quickly on the adventure you're about to partake on.Only thing is, unlike many, many imitations to follow in the next couple of decades, Writer George Lucas and Director Steven Spielberg decided action and the set-pieces weren't enough. In addition to the great action/adventure and thrill rides that will take you through the climax, they focused mainly on character depth and story. Both flourished. Namely with, of course, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford.) Though Ford didn't start his career in 1977's Star Wars, he certainly began stretching his legs and made himself into an icon. An movie star people cared about. Then came 1980's The Empire Strikes Back where he flourished and added the much needed depth to his Han Solo character in the sequel. There's no question: Indiana Jones is Harrison Ford. Or is it vice versa? Ford didn't just make the cardboard adventurer based on the old movie serials one note, he breathed life into the role, beyond just having the audience care for him. They wanted to be him. I would want to be him. And as super-human as he is, Ford made sure he was still just plain human, flaws and all. Of course, he always has to come out on top, despite the odds.Beyond him, no one else, from Allen's love interest Marion to the monkey, was just one note. Sure they didn't steal the spotlight as Indy/Ford dominated, but each was just as believable and needed in their roles.After the great opening that is sure to hook even the skeptical viewer, the mystery begins involving the race to find the 'lost ark,' the ark that supposedly contains the original Ten Commandments that Moses stored, before those pesky Nazis get their hands on it. Classic good vs. evil.Along the way you'll be in store with romance, comedy, more adventure and action sequences and one of the greatest scores orchestrated by the great John Williams. Just as he previously breathed life into Superman in Superman: The Movie with his fantastic music, he gives the well-written Indiana Jones a soul.I understand I'm not giving this movie the proper justice with all that I could say about it, but suffice to say, this absolute classic is worth a viewing for all, including those who've already seen it. It was refreshing to see 'real' movie making again for my, I don't know, 24th time, with NO CGI. Aside from the (today's) comical face melting in the finale, everything else not only works, but makes you apart of the rideof a lifetime. See it!",10,2,4,4 June 2010
Deepwater Horizon," Biggest Event Horizon
","Ahhh, this movie reminds me of when I was on an oil rig disaster and we were trapped with little oxygen left. Suddenly a mana man literally on fireshowed up out of nowhere and led us to the Coast Guard's helicopter. But, we wouldn't have made it out alive if he hadn't single-handedly held up the metal tower that would've surely crashed down on the transportand us. He stayed behind so we could escape. What a super-man he wasOh, shoot. That was Man of Steel. This was real life.My biggest regret in this movie was that I did not see it on the big screen. Well, okay, that and me making a poor joke reference up-front on an incident that claimed eleven lives and destroyed a tremendous amount more in the 3-month spill following. The first half is setup leading to an inevitable disaster. Backing up, sadly, I didn't know any hardcore details of this incident. I knew of giant man-made oil spills and a BP-caused catastrophe(s,) I just didn't connect the dots here. It was just obvious from the get-go: this won't end well.At any rate, normally when I watch a disaster-film, I am generally impatient and want to get to the goods. As soon as possible. Not this time, though. I found the first 50 or so minutes fascinating. A day in the life of these drillers and the technicalities of the oil drill rig was quite interesting and both believably and beautifully shot. And then. Then the mud hit the fan and the movie gets enormously and horrifically brutal. And the movie never lets up. I already felt this was well-shot, albeit a grown-up Michael Bay film. And it continued to have great cinematography through explosions, massive damage and heroism. Again, it sounds like a Michael Bay movie, but again, it was far more mature filmmaking than that man-child will ever achieve.Yes, I wish I saw this on the big screen and I wish more had. This movie was incredible with its grand-scale spectacle of the rig going haywire around these workers. But the movie is not without its flaws.Yes, there are big-bad businessmen out there who make colossal-sized mistakesI know of a few in the many jobs I've had (though, not to cost lives, mercifully) and these were a tad over-the-top. And on the flipside, while I wasn't there, the heroism touched on the Man of Steel reference I made above. I truly hope this is what happened – the men going after other survivors to save lives and the 'Captain' more concerned about his crew than his potentially life-threatening injuries. I got past my own negative thoughts and even couldn't help but tear up at the end. Thankfully, the movie knew when to quit and not make this an unnecessary and padded three-hour, overblown (no pun) drama. It had just enough screen time to introduce and fascinate us, take us through bad- decisions/bad-outcomes and give us the on-screen facts I was looking forward to thorough. Especially since I was completely ignorant on these events.Highly recommend this action/true-life film. More so for people with a HUGE entertainment center at home since it was sorely missed on the big screen. ***Final thoughts: When I first heard the premise and especially since it was a true story of an oil rig tragedy, unfortunately, I dismissed it as 'not my kind of movie.' EVEN with my knowledge of the film starring John Malkovich, Kurt Russell and Marky Mark. This all when it was in theatres. Trust meI'm gonna rethink my life. This movie already impressed me wholeheartedly at home. It would've blown me away on the silver screen. (Again, no pun.)",8,0,1,4 January 2017
Stop-Loss," National Lampoon's Sexy-N-Loose
","My mistake for thinking this was a serious war-is-hell movie prior to seeing it. That all ended seconds into the film when the 'MTV' logo appeared. It might as well been called 'National Lampoon's Sexy-N-Loose.' And it did play to the 'MTV' crowd; the movie that followed those comical first few seconds played like the music videos they used to play 40+ years ago. At least Disney was smart enough to ship its Rated R stuff over to Touchtone and allowed us to take it seriously. Okay, I'm being harsh; it wasn't that bad of a film. However, it definitely has its share of overacting and the film is extremely biased/one-sided. Admittedly, I'm not a war movie buff. I can't watch 'Platoon,' 'Full Metal Jacket' or 'Saving Private Ryan' more than once. Sure they were good movies, but they're not my forte and they all seem to blend in after awhile to where I wouldn't be able to distinguish one from the next. Following a tour in Iraq, Phillippe plans life after the war but is drawn back in due to a clause in his contract. Or, at least, that's the military's plan until he goes AWOL and the characters speed cross-country on a few bucks amazingly never caught. No, I haven't been in any war, nor to Iraq, nor do I agree with it. I also don't have all the knowledge when it comes to recruitment or signing their contracts. I can say this: though I am sorry they're drawn back into this conflict, I can't feel too much for someone so dumb not to read the fine print. It's like someone on their deathbed leaning over to finally read the Surgeon General's warning on their box of cigarettes and say, 'Oh, they're what? Deadly? I'll sue them!'",4,3,3,22 June 2009
Deja Vu," Source Code: the Prequel
","Coming off the action high, Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, I yearned to watch another action-packed new-to-me adventure. Upon a great recommendation, I watched Déjà Vu.I am a Denzel fanbut only when he's not screaming for an Oscar (such as American Gangster) and when he actually earns it (such as Training Day.) Of course, my favorite of his are the smart action pics like Man on Fire or Crimson Tide. I'm certainly adding this one to that list.With a unique twist on the time machine/look back in a place in time genre, Déjà Vu does, in fact, make one of my 2011 favorites, Source Code, a Déjà Vu. ATF agent Doug Carlin (Washington) is investigating a blown up boat that killed 100s of innocents, including children, women and service men. He's introduced to a program where one can look back exactly 4½ days to aid in any investigation. Handy, eh?Well, it can do a lot more than that. It can go within any structure and recreate every bit of privacy people have. Tell me how people would react today if this were true?In either case, that's incidental to this plot after a few lessons, Doug's got it down and races against time for a gal he actually falls for prior to the explosion and might contain valuable information to prevent the act of terrorism.It's an exciting, albeit popcorn-fare, movie and if you're a Denzel fan, you'd probably really enjoy it. Even if you're not a (Director) Tony Scott fan, like I am not.",8,2,4,18 December 2011
It," It Follows a Nightmare on King's Sandlot
","And they say remakes are never better than the original. This one highly surpassed the two before it!Yes, two. Not just the 1990 original TV disaster, but Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street in 1984 – two years prior to the novel being published. As I watched this movie, I kept feeling the wonder and fright of the original Freddy Krueger movie. And I was laughing to myself when Freddy, himself, all-but made a cameo in this film.This film seems to be following the latest trend of 80s nostalgia, so much so, it stars the same child actor from the best 80s recreation in modern history: Netflix's Stranger Things. I'm certainly not complaining, when done right, as in this movie, it's wonderful to transport back to that era when I grew up. This is probably another reason why I also got the Freddy-vibe since around this film's time frame happened, I discovered and fell in love with The Springwood Slasher.To say 2017's It was better than the 1990 miniseries is like loving pizza more than cancer. There IS NO comparison. I recently watched the messy TV movie and cringed at all the poor dialogue, unintentionally bad acting and terrible decisions of the flashbacks. This timethey got it right.Summer 1989 – my favorite summer (and year) of movies and shown wonderfully here with Batman, Lethal Weapon 2 and A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child playing at their local theatre – many kids go missing and so does police procedures. It's almost as if the police, and town, for that matter, are working with whatever's taking the children. (Supposedly, adults are taken, but that's only briefly mentioned and never shown or brought up again.)A trio of best buds (playfully?) nicknamed The Losers, double their size when chance coincidences occur and that's a good thing. They'll need each other to face a hallucinating devil clown after them who uses their fears against them.I have said this so many times, in fact, just in my last review, but Damn! I wish I saw this as a kid, the same age as these boys. While I was already hooked by this point on horror, if I hadn't been, this would've been a wonderful introduction, a gateway if you will, to scary movies. But, be that as it may, I really dug this film.Wonderfully shot, great acting from absolute kids that totally stole the movie from any adult actor and genuine frights. This had a merciful and well needed R-rating that the 1990 version sadly lacked.While it was a tad long at times and scenes certainly could've been cut to smooth out the pacing – the cleaning up blood, rock 'n roll montage really felt out of place here, despite the 80s vibe. I wouldn't have gone as far as to squeeze Stephen King's brilliant 1,138-page novel into one movie, but it certainly didn't need to be over 2 hours. Any fan of horror, the book It, Stephen King in general or new to exploring horror, this is a must-watch. It was refreshing to go back to what horror felt like to me in the late 80s.***Final thoughts: October Day 1: 2017's It. We're off to a great start! Well, until day 2's Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II. But, in my defense, I'm only watching that for the first time as it coincides with the date and I've always loved the name and poster. Oh, and huh, *that* movie was released mere months before this film's opening took place. Go figure.",8,2,3,1 October 2017
Hereditary," Going in Cold
","Do as I did: If you haven't seen this, stop now, rent/buy this movie and watch it as cold as possible. Can't ask for a much better movie-going experience.Well, and then, come back and enjoy my review. :-)Yep, one of my favorite ways to go into a movie is: COMPLETELY COLD. Not hearing anything, not who stars in the movie, the basic plot, hell, not even the subgenre, if it's divided. Someone recommended this to me months ago and now that it's available for home viewing, I finally got to see it.These past few months haven't been easy to live in the dark surrounding the movie because...people like to talk. What they don't see as a spoiler is darn well a spoiler for someone like me that doesn't ever want to see trailers because, again, I like to go in stone cold and just on a recommendation from someone.Whew! I severely digress. Back to the movie. Since I already gave the disclaimer up front, I can freely talk about the movie. Though, with as little revealed as possible.As the title suggests, things are passed on in this overly melancholy family. In the beginning, the grandmother dies and leaves the Mom/Dad, Daughter/Son family the main focus, and actually two more than others. But, bam! Just when you thought it was safe to go down the path of normal horror, the tides shift and more misery emerges.Honestly, I wasn't a fan of this movie for the majority of it. I thought the performances were too over the top, the family was obscenely creepy and the drama was thick enough to cut with a knife. And then...Things began to open my eyes and more and more revealed to drop my jaw. And sadly, it's only then that you realize that they've given you so many clues in this supposedly slow-burn mystery that you almost feel stupid for not picking up on everything. And then we have the climax.I loved it and it tied in everything so joyfully, this is definitely one of my favorite horror movies in a while and probably for 2018 for sure. It demands repeat viewings and I sure as HELL can't wait to see it again. IF you took my warning up front seriously and managed to avoid the hype, the spoilers, the reviews including this one, and watched and enjoyed it, bravo. I hope you had such an incredible experience as I did and wish they made more horror movies like this and not the cookie-cutter-conjuring ghost stories of late. THIS IS ORIGINALITY and I crave it more than any sh]t-storm Hollywood spits out just to make a buck.***Final thoughts: I was actually going to rewatch the entire movie a second time (and will do so, anyways) before writing my review. But, I watched enough 'Ending/Movie explained' and 'Movie Review' YouTube videos that I pretty much saw the movie a second time anyways. If you missed anything in the movie or felt this isn't as great as I'm portraying it to be, feel free to watch said YouTube videos. They'll probably convince you: You're Wrong, This Movie is GREAT!",9,17,32,3 September 2018
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," No Lie: This Sucked
","I have been told it's not proper and even below this industry to call a movie 'stupid' in one's review. But, damn, I will unapologetically call most of the scenes in Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter just plain stupid.Granted, I am NOT a fan of CGI, or overused Matrix tricks without explanation. (I mean, reallywasn't the original Matrix almost 14 years ago?) In this mesh of realities, which I gave kudos to for being original in idea only, some of the axe-wielding scenes, especially involving horses, were so insanely comical and cartoonish, it was hard to even like this a little bit. It also didn't help having an incredibly bland Benjamin Walker play Mr. Lincoln. (Oh, and before you speak, I hadn't seen Daniel Day-Lewis's portrayal of the 16th President up to this point yet. So, I hadn't a recent version of Lincoln to compare this performance to.)Walker was so bad, so boring, that when scenes weren't dripping with terrible dime store fake blood, he made the rest of the movie almost completely unbearable. Mercifully, when on screen, which wasn't that much, Dominic Cooper's Henry Sturges character, friend and mentor of Dishonest Abe, made up for some of the life that was sucked out by Walker.(I'm going to love this one) When a vampire movie mimics the Twilight series, it's already headed towards trouble. Here, like that kiddie series that happily concluded last year, vampires can walk in sunshine. Apparently, they just taught themselves that talent. Abe's mommy is killed by one vamp and as in 100s of movie plots, he wanders with rage until directed to fight back by pal Henry. This includes, but isn't limited to, cutting down an entire tree with one stroke because one can imagine it as an enemy. Hmmm.Eventually, Abe's conflicted with hunting vampires, killing the one who destroyed his mom, true love and I guess incidentally, being the President of the United States.Obviously, the movie's not to be taken seriously, but c'mon. This movie was so poorly made, so bad, that even when a decent character or scene shows up, enough unforgivable stuff is still in your mind to dismiss the positive. Skip it and see the real-deal Lincoln movie of the year: Lincoln.",2,2,4,6 January 2013
Training Day," He Don't Need No Training
","Much like Nicole Kidman in To Die For, this Training Day was a Denzel Washington vehicle. Both movies were ho-hum, but held the character of a lifetime and is highly recommended just on their command performance.This is not to underplay Hawke's almost (90%) equally acting – he was very good, himself, but Washington was so good, that when I first saw this back in 2001, long before the Oscar Nominations were announced, I said: 'He better both be nominated and win.' On a side note, unfortunately for Washington Fans – he has tried to recapture this high since and that's made me very sad to say I once was a devote Washington follower. Meaning: almost every role since 2001's Training Day, he has screamed 'OSCAR!' without acting much.But, I digress, this is about Training Day, a good (again, not great) film, but one you should see concerning the troubling day both Rookie Hoyt (Hawke) and Harris (Washington) are having.Eager to please and diligent to keep his job for his growing family, Hoyt is joining the narcotics hard-core L.A. team, but he needs to deal with drama-filled Harris, who may (or may not) be on the take with the crooks he's paid to take down. (Watch FX's excellent series The Shield for further adventures on the same plane.) You see, Harris might be in over his head with a deal/incident gone wrong in Las Vegas, pissing off the wrong people, despite his demeanor. And he must trust the Clark Kent'ish Hoyt if he's to get away with it.That's pretty much it. I don't want to spoil much more than that, and the fact I brought up The Shield, which covers pretty much the same ground. That's pretty much itfor the plot. Watch this fantastic performance from Denzel who, up to this point of his excellent career, hadn't played a true baddie. And he does it in spades. It's worth the Orientation Day for him alone.",6,0,1,14 November 2010
John Wick," A Man and His Dog
","FINALLY. What seems like 30 movies I've seen with Keanu, he's impressed me.John Wick is anything but original and yetit's thoroughly entertaining and just my type of bad guy/revenge flick. Not since 1999's Payback have I been this pleased. It's one of those movies I just finished and want to see all over again.Through and through, 90% of this has been done before, but since Keanu finally stood up and acted and since it takes no prisoners with its brutality and shameless acts of gun violence, it's one for the books. John Wick's the stereotypical badass retiree who's pulled back in on a whim and hell, everyone better watch their back. Reminding me a lot of both Payback and Eastern Promises, not to mention every single 'One- last-job-before-or-after-retirement' plot, John Wick seems to separate itself with a Keanu you finally root for.Literally, there's not much to say but to enjoy the enormously action packed ride of John, his past, his presence and how many bullets it takes to provide vengeance. It's a pity this didn't make more at the box-office. I could see this on repeat and not get bored.* * *Final thoughts: Make your life complete with a double-punch/double- feature of this and Payback. (NOT the director's sh|t take of Payback. Just the original theatrical release.) Both are similar and will be having you root for the bad guy.",8,5,11,19 March 2015
Gravity," Open Space
","Gravity will take your breath away. Literally.This could've been just me, but I was extremely out of breath when I left the theatre. Perhaps, I was holding my breath many times in one of the most exciting and tension-built movie I've seen in a long time. I just thank God Stanley Kubrick wasn't around to direct/write this or we would've been in the theatre twice the merciful 90 minutes and I might have passed out.Now, I'm no astronaut, never studied or worked at NASA or plan a trip out into space, so I cannot comment on if any of the events in Gravity could ever happen, especially since the many, MANY, obstacles that do happen, happen so simultaneously, all that occurred might as well overlapped each other. Now, that does lead me to believe that most of what happened wouldn't or couldn't happen, but then again, I'm no expert. What I can say, as a layman, dumbed down or written in for the excitement, it was one helluva ride.In one enormously thin plot, a doctor had previously trained for 6-months at NASA and heads to space to repair a gadget, when the Russians decide then would be a good time to inadvertently, or on purpose, blow up a satellite causing debris to head toward them. Unlike Star Trek, et al, there aren't invisible shields and this causes all-but two astronauts to be stranded in space without the rest of their crew or a ship to get home in.Luckily – though, it may not seem that way when you watch it! – there are other options in space to get you home and the rest of the movie is just that: The Voyage Home (to swing back to the Star Trek analogy.Visually, the movie is breathtaking – as covered above, the score is decent, the mood nice, I loved the calmness and caring of Clooney's character and Sandra's acting was pretty good. But, the most you'll take from this was the non-stop, science fiction or not, action. Those with heart conditions should literally talk with their doctor before seeing this.On the downside and on the surface, huh, the movie lacks or was just mediocre in every other category. The dialogue, while not bad, wasn't memorable, but for a couple of lines. The story, again, is really nothing but a tiny bit of background and then just a survival story. And some of the very placed debris, i.e. toys and obvious space references, were more REALLY? moments for me in such a serious picture.That all said, overall the movie's genre is probably a 50/50 split between suspense and action, and the movie, once the Russian debris hit, never ceases to provide what the core of the movie is: a suspenseful action film.For moviegoers who like over-the-top tension and fun – and I had both, this is a total recommendation. Especially in LIEMAX. The 3D is just for those gimmicky and REALLY? objects to float towards you with minute exceptions to when something does add to the tension, but those were rare.* * * Final thoughts: Yeah, of course, I was thinking of the film, Open Water, throughout this movie. While that 'against all odds, 2-survivors (one male, one female) stranded and adrift in water' movie felt 10x more realistic, this 'against all odds, 2-survivors (one male, one female) stranded and adrift in space' film will was certainly a lot more funand heart pounding!",8,1,6,6 October 2013
Wind River," Hawkeye Hunts Again
","But the Witch ain't be witchin'.I typed in the simple search: Best Westerns on Netflix. Signs this list is corrupt, or gulp!, 45 is right about Google, recommendation #6 was Adam Sandler's atrocious The Ridiculous 6. But, mercifully, #7 was this movie and they were right with this one!When I was a kid, I *HATED* Westerns. In the 90s, as I grew, that changed, but only a hand-selected few, like Unforgiven and Dances With Wolves, two of my favorite Westerns and all-time movies. As I got much older, I really started to dig the genre and especially the subgenre: the neo-western, or modern western(?) like No Country for Old Men and Hell or High Water. Frankly, I like both versions equally and a lot: the ones set in the olden days and the modern westerns with all the tropes still in place today.This film, is the latter group, unbeknownst to me and it did NOT disappoint.Hunter Hawkeye, well, Veteran Hunter, Cory, returns to his ex-wife's reservation to find/kill lions. Instead, he's thrust into a conspiracy involving a rape, murders, hush people and a lone FBI agent way out of her league. This movie is beautiful, enormously well-acted, awesomely scripted and though slow at times, it kept me on the edge of my seat. This setting isn't too far from Fargo, but you'll get the same vibes at times.I've been a fan of Jeremy Renner for about two decades and when I saw he was in this, I worried he would be a distraction. Like I'd ONLY see 'Jeremy Renner' and not Sheriff Joe or whomever he played. NOPE...he was wonderful in this and I totally bought him and the rest of the cast. Well, maybe not so much FBI Agent and fellow Avenger, Elizabeth Olsen. She was such a fish-outta-water, she never did it for me with the other perfectly casted actors.Don't get me wrong. This is a near-perfect film and I adored every minute of it. Helps, I love, again, Modern Westerns, and the snow - you'll feel every bit of the snow here. HIGHLY recommended and I can't wait to see this again.***Final thoughts: THAT ALL SAID...I'm beginning to think they have a database of cowboy/country/western/location names to choose from when creating a Western movie. This movie had almost zero to do with Wind, Rivers or the actual Wind River place I'm not even sure if we saw.",9,0,0,3 September 2018
Wayne's World," Party ON, but not to Part 2
","Amazingly, 'Wayne's World' accomplished 2 huge feats: every joke's funny and it's the only SNL skit that actually works. (Note: every other 5 minute sketch stretched to 1.5 hours either falls flat or is mediocre, at best.) From the 'excellent' cameos (Alice Cooper was downright hilarious) to the music segments that 'rock' to the talk-to-the-camera and spoofs that produce some of the funniest moments, 'Wayne's World' really does work. Too many great quotes to reprint, I found myself saying out loud half the movie. It helped that, when in theaters (1992) I saw it 3x. I took a date who coincidentally was the same person I took to only my second concert: Alice Cooper. She didn't understand most of the humor, while I was rolling with laughter. Furthermore, I remember her wondering why Cooper talked the way he did backstage as opposed to on stage. If you don't follow that, or a lot of the inside jokes, this movie may not be for you. However, anyone who grew up in the 70s and 80s should very much appreciate the quality of jokes and references. I.E. 'Laverne & Shirley in Scooby Doo's Mystery of Noah's Ark.' Basic plot involves the late night cable access (long before internet) show 'Wayne's World' is being targeted to a wider audience by a suspicious Rob Lowe. Everything else is just 1 skit after another, that was actually original and consistent. The entire cast was great, including Carrere, Carvey, O'Neill and Boyle. The soundtrack was wonderful. Even the chemistry between Carrere/Myers rang true (and on the other side, the relationship between Myers and his ex also showed honesty.) The only thing that did not fare well was 'Wayne's World 2.' But that's another movie all together. Watch the original & avoid the sequel at all costs.",9,5,8,30 May 2009
The Big Lebowski," Lebowski Gets Bigger With Every Viewing
","God, I don't even know where to start with The Big Lebowski. Perhaps at the beginning?My (then) boyfriend practically forced me in 2002-3 to watch this against my will – holding me down, as he was bigger and stronger, while propping my eyes open, a la Clockwork Orange. Okay, fine, he suggested it, I hesitated and gave inis how it really went down. At any rate, I only mildly liked it then when he was rolling with his signature and usually contagious laughter.The movie grew on me, however, over the years – and that's not with extra viewings. In fact, until last night, 2/4/2011, I hadn't seen it since. I have thought about this feature, discussed with others and found myself laughing at scenes and dialogue that I hadn't seen or heard in years. Damn, I'm glad I decided to finally revisit it in order to finally review it.The movie was enormously well written and original. Hilarious, spot on and had some of the best deliveries. When I tried to find the ONE scene I loved the most or the ONE line I favored above the rest, it was incredibly difficult. I ended up picking the sex/bowling dream even though all scenes with the 'Caucasian' (or White Russian) in his hand, especially when he should've spilled it, but didn't, had me cracking up. And the lines throughout were clever, ingenious and memorable/quotable, but to narrow it down, I simply picked the 'Shut the f*ck up, Donny!' line that's repeated many times. Each time I heard that, even the 15th, made me laugh out loud.But, the movie's strength wasn't just in the comedy. It's incredibly creative and has a novel approach to the old mistaken identity plot. Throw in great cinematography, convincing twists and wonderful acting and you have a near-perfect film and probably my favorite Coen Brothers feature.Further, the characters really drove the film even above and beyond what was already mentioned. Most were excellent and original, but Jeff Bridges actually should have received his first (of many deserved) Oscar for his role as 'The Dude.' The uniqueness, depth and believability alongside Bridges' own spin and acting made The Dude one of my all time favorite characters in films.Caucasian drinking, robe-wearing, unemployed and lazy-ass The Dude struts through life while bowling with his wacked ex-'Nam buddy, Walter (Goodman) and Donny (Buscemi) untilone day he's mistaken for wealthy Jeffrey Lebowski (Huddleston) who shares the same name as The Dude's real name.There's been a kidnapping of the appropriately named 'Bunny' (Reid), the wife of 'The Big(ger) Lebowski,' for a million bucks and The Dude, as sluggish as he is, pays as close attention to this as would a pet gerbil to its surroundings. But, one of the bad men pee on his rug that sets off a chain of unfortunate events that get The Dude and Walter into trouble as they investigate and try and disfuse the situation sothey can get back to their bowling league.More clues and kookier characters blend into the mix and the Coen Brothers don't even miss a beat in making this unbelievably realistic. Example: Jesus, (Turturro) and yes, you pronounce it as the same Man on the cross, wanders in and out of the movie setting up a hilarious but completely irrelevant character. That's how it is in the real world.Sure, the movie actually goes on for a little longer than it should – the movie's only real flaw, but it's worth the entire trip (yeah, literal trip.) Also, there's a hell of a lot of swearing. I kinda matched that in my review, which is something I normally don't do, but here, it's relevant.The Big Lebowski is a prime example of how to make a movie. And quite frankly, this movie can be broken down and studied. For, line by line, it's pure craftsmanship.",9,1,2,5 February 2011
Unbreakable," The Bone Bros
","Well, M. Night's streak of one great movie was, in fact, broken following this.I know, I know. People cherish The Sixth Sense and Signs, but this was not only by far M. Night Shyamalan's best work, it was his only really good work. (For the record, I thought The Sixth Sense was alright even when I saw the twist 25 minutes into my first viewing and Signs was so- so at best and made me unintentionally laugh out loud many times.) And I think I am in agreeance with everyone else: beyond The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs, the rest of his 'films' range from pretty bad to some of the worst 'movies' ever made.But, I digress. Getting back to the film that I found to have just some minor flaws. And let's get those out of the way so I can get back to praising this.Though it's typical M. Night fashion, the first two acts had some slow- ass scenes. Yes, I understand why – tension, build-up, suspense, whatever, but I found them unnecessary to the rest of the film that flowed very nicely. Also, the film was probably too short for such territory to cover. For example, I would've liked to see a minimum of two more scenes of heroism, the train accident that sets this whole thing in motion wasn't shown (?!) and the ending was abrupt and it would've been nicer to see it than read it. In fact, both the train scene and the finale should've been 'Show don't tell.' I am uncertain if that was a budgetary concern or a choice. I hope not the latter. And finally, why or how the heck did David NOT realize any of these abilities or strengths up to this point? It felt extremely unlikely he wouldn't have ever put two and two together without a frail male pointing it out so late in life.Whew! Getting those out of the way, of all the areas I liked: mood, cinematography, score, acting, drive, tension, dialogue and originality, I loved the premise of the film the most. I remember seeing this when it first came out and 16-years later, my opinion stands: this is definitely one of the most adult 'comic-book' movies made. (Actually, at the time, I called it thee most adult 'comic-book' movie made, but since then, there has been some outstanding real-life kinds of comic-book films.)David Dunn doesn't just survive two train wrecks (one in this film and the other not being in the remaining M. Night films,) but he walks away without a scratch on him. In what seems to be a trademark with Dunn, he's dumbfounded by this and goes back to his actual broken home life. Luckily for him, the mysterious 'Mr. Glass' points out several superhuman aspects of Dunn's life in a series of stalking scenes. Even though Dunn's done with him, he starts to question his own life and purpose. In the movie, Mr. Glass is a huge comic book collector and expert. He's also the opposite of Dunn. He's the Breakable Man, whereas: you just look at him the wrong way and his bones break. He's intrigued to find someone that has everything he wasn't granted at birth. He truly believes comic book legends, namely the 'superhero v archenemy' genre, mirror real life, or vice versa. And though it's coincidence, at least in this movie's universe, I do LOVE the names: David Dunn and Mr. Glass. Just a side-note there as a comic book fan, myself.Early in M. Night's resume, he couldn't help but put major twists in the closing. Unfortunately, I felt both The Sixth Sense and The Village were ONLY made for the twists, but the two in-between, Unbreakable and Signs, were real movies that happened to have a cherry-on-top in the closing. Of the first four mentioned projects, this was by-far my favorite twist. Upon a second viewing, there were more than enough foretelling of said twist, but that's okay: it was very good beforehand and the ending just made it even better. I know M. Night hasn't done a sequel yet and in 95% of his projects, that's truly a blessing. But this one was always one I wanted a follow- up to. Unfortunately, it's been 16 years and both Bruce Willis and Sam Jackson aren't getting any younger. It would be too much like the far- too-late Indy films all over again, sadly.But, since I can't get my wish, I will continue to enjoy this taunt thriller. The one real gem in M. Night's career.***Final thoughts: By the way, I love the foreshadowing of Sam Jackson in front of an artwork of Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. I also see the actor playing Dunn's son went on to star in the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. T.V. series. Huh.",8,0,1,3 September 2016
Star Trek," Star Royale: Boldly Continue!
","I'm a fan of the 'Star Trek' universe, and know a lot about it. However, I have yet to see an original episode of the 60s TV show. That being said, I am very attuned to episodes and the mythology behind it. 2009's 'Star Trek' reboot does it justice and then some. You get Pike, you get the green sexy female, you get the original Enterprise (how many ships/letters did they go through?) In fact, you get all that original material and lines that people grew up on. And the most amazing thing is that J.J. Abrams (solely underrated 'Mission: Impossible III') is NOT a 'Star Trek' fan. He was able to take such a storied and solid franchise and play tribute while delivering a great popcorn/summer film. 'Star Trek' was visually stunning, had great action pieces, suspense, comedy, cameos, continuity, and even a great cast that followed 'The Brady Bunch Movie' with mirrored, younger cast members that were perfect for the roles (it took awhile for Scotty to show up, but great-in-everything Pegg, and when he did, it surely added dimensions to the film.) Yes, it's another 'Trek' film, yes, it has cameos from films past (Nimoy) and yes, it's another time-traveling 'Trek' feature, but BOY, was it entertaining. I would highly recommend this movie, to 'Trek' lovers and non-believers. Visually stunning as it was, it proves, given the right script, these reboots ('Casino Royale,' 'Batman Begins,' and 'Halloween') actually add so much to the pot. The movie, concerning a time traveling, revenge filled Romulan (Bana) and a wet-behind-the-ears space-cadets only flaws involve the weak Nimoy storyline (it almost seemed forced, yet, I loved seeing him again, and his devotion to his Kirk-friendship) and the ho-hum villain, Bana. Nevertheless, I strongly recommend this movie.",9,2,11,9 May 2009
Train to Busan," Only Z this World War
","While these aren't the zombies I'm looking for, the movie made up for every wrong-doing in World War Z.Train to Busan is an incredibly well-shot, well-acted and well-thought- out zombie/infected film with characters you care about, want to see grow and live. It might have had a low budget, but you'd never know it; this foreign film looked like a major Hollywood movie.Now, though the many scenes of heart, exposition, depth, setup and introduction to our 'heroes' worked really well, the movie was terribly too long. I wasn't really complaining throughout for pacing or length, nor was I wondering if scenes could be cut, but it still went on far longer than it should have. It was almost as if there were 5-6 climaxes and then you realize you still have 45-25 minutes left.Also, and this is a personal preference, the zombies ran at Mach One speed. Sincerely, I love zombie shows and I'm a purist at heart. The slow, stumbling, 'yes, you can walk right past them' kinds are what frighten me the most. The exception to the rule was 2004's Dawn of the Dead remake. They were fast, fine, but the movie's all-around greatness made me forget my hang-up on the bionic-beasts.And Train to Busan did the same thing. There was so much good here, the zombies were pretty much incidental to everything else I liked. Basically a divorced and selfish dad agrees to take his daughter to see her mom on a train when the 77,493th zombie-apocalypse begins. (That's not a complaint to how many there are, just a semi-fact. Still love this subgenre!) Unfortunately for the passengers, an infected, bitten, Walker, The Living Dead or Zombie – pick your poison, gets on board and all hell breaks loose. Unlike most of the Z movies, you will see characters grow and scenes so powerful, it'd be hard not to choke up. I certainly did. And though the film's not without the standard clichés and stereotypical evil/not-evil scared humans, it's easy to also get past those movie tropes since the actors are so strong and believable.I really, really did like this movie. If you're a fan of zombie flicks and require a lot more depth and sometimes humor, you cannot go wrong here.***Final thoughts: Day 2 Movie in the Can! I'm watching a NEW-2-ME horror movie every day of October 2016 and this one I've heard good things about. I actually put it off too long just to save for October. Wish I hadn't; not only was the movie great, it had some incredibly cute Asian men that I wouldn't mind finding more films with them in it.",8,2,6,2 October 2016
The Maze Runner," Hardly aMAZEd
","While I was happy to finally see a male-oriented film series – and yeah, even before the last half hour of 'To Be Continued!' scenes – in a female dominated marketplace (the Twilight 'saga,' The Hunger Games and Divergent) this movie all-but completely blew.Aside from The Maze Runner being a blatant rip-off of the superior Cube film, or its sequels, it was so incredibly bland, run-of-the- mill, predictable and A-B-C, I actually fell asleep during the movie. It didn't help that the movie was twenty minutes too long and that I knew what scene would take place four scenes ahead.During the movie I was absolutely giving it the benefit of the doubt. Without so much as telling us this was 'Part One' of a trilogy (or four movies, depending on how well the first one does and they inevitably split the last movie into two so they can milk the series our longer than it needs, i.e. The Hunger Games, Harry Potter and Twilight,) the movie seemed to take its long time to explain everything out in extreme detail of their world. I was trying to be as patient as possible when I knew this was a necessity since this is a sci-fi, futuristic test for young boys.But, the rest of the movie played out this way. As if in narration form. They constantly had to tell us and remind us of the world they're referring to in the very movie they're showing us. I get it. I got it. And unfortunately, they we're showing me anything new.So, I waited and waited for something fresh. Some new take. Nope. And worse, as mentioned above, the last half-hour was NOTHING but setting up the inevitable sequels. I am getting ahead of myself since I haven't mentioned the synopsis. Very basically, once a month, a new young male recruit is transported into the middle of an obscenely large maze. He has memory loss and must have the entire plot be explained to him so he can integrate with the other males. They've been there between 3 years and present day and must make it through a hefty and unexplainably moving maze to get back to where they don't remember they've come from.Naturally, our 'hero,' Thomas, is THE ONE to help them get free. With little explanation and in one of the most pointless plots of recent movies, he joins forces with one of the most uncharismatic of all females – the first girl to join the group. Hilariously enough, she looks incredibly similar to Kristen Stewart of her Twilight series. Just like Bella, Stewart's bland heroine from Twilight, this one offers nothing to the table and is so hard to root for. In fact, it appears this endless rock-throwing female was only introduced to attract more female viewers.And that is a huge part of the problems here. While, again, I am glad to finally see a male-dominated teeny-bop series, not one single character had the charisma of any of the other series. Yeah, I'm not a huge Harry Potter or Hunger Games fan, but each of those had characters I rooted for and wanted to see succeed. This Maze Runner had one, and he was absolutely a second or third tier fella: Chuck. But, then again, if you've seen The Sandlot, he was the same guy who called that main character 'Smalls.'With virtually no one to root for, a story as old as time, decent special effects but barely used and predictable scenes from beginning to no-conclusion, this movie is highly UN-recommended. Granted, it's not the worst movie I've seen in a long while and definitely not the worst of 2014 so far, it will be so forgettable, they will be regretting they only made this movie to be part of a trilogy that should never be completed.* * *Final thoughts: If you're thinking of beginning this so-so franchise, either do one of two things: Wait for this to all come to home- viewing and have a boring, nothing weekend to get through them all or just rent/buy/stream the superior Cube series. Essentially, they're the same movie, but Cube had a tenth of the budget with ten times the heart, originality, imagination, suspense and characters than The Maze Runner had at any given moment.",3,135,209,20 September 2014
Memento," Tattoo 'Memento' on your body as a MUST SEE
","This is my second viewing of 'Memento' since it debuted in 2000 and I have the same feelings about it: masterpiece, original, great dialogue, wonderful concept and extremely well acted. And since 2000, hardly any other movie has come close to the brilliance this movie has shown. What other movie has been played backward? 'Memento' starts off with a murder and works its way carefully and uniquely backwards through a mystery a man with no short-term memory and an audience must solve. Pearce plays the main character completely convincingly as does co-stars (and 'Matrix' co-stars) Moss and Pantoliano. A man stricken with no short-term memory after an accident must put together pieces of a puzzle after his wife gets murdered, so he can get revenge. Along the way he meets and re-meets people who might be aiding his quest, all the while we learn certain people are extremely dangerous. I can't say enough, I LOVED this movie. Everything worked for it, and finally a movie (not a dumb summer popcorn movie, sorry 'Transformers') makes me use my brain. You really have to think, take little breaks and pay attention. I admired the episode of 'Seinfeld' when they did the same thing (one of the series best episodes ever) – and that was the only other work I can think of that used this concept: telling the story backwards. Sure, you can like big-budgeted movies, but they hardly ever show the respect that director Christopher Nolan did during this feature. Ironically, Nolan also directed the big-budgeted, latest 'Batman' adventures. Guess what? They're 100x better than the previous four. This man knows what's good and how to show it. Sit back, listen to every word spoken or unspoken and enjoy one of the best mysteries, or simply, best movies ever made.",10,0,2,30 June 2009
Inglourious Basterds," 1 hour less would have been 'glourious'
","My first reaction when leaving 'Inglourious Basterds' was 'They could've cut a good hour out of that film!' And as much as I ONLY went to this movie due to Tarantino, I think he was so in love with his work, he barely edited out a second of footage. Even if the misleading advertisements were true – 'Killing Nazis!' actually only takes up approx 1/6 of the movie, as does Pitt's character – I still wouldn't have been interested in the subject matter. I'm just not into war/period-piece movies. Again, only Tarantino's name got me to buy a ticket. In 'Basterds's defense, it was much more than just a period piece, or war movie, so I'll give it that. I'll also praise a lot of great scenes that made me laugh, snicker, jump, root and admire. Unfortunately, they were so few and very, VERY far between, I'm seriously reducing my rating. I miss the old Tarantino, as even if the movie was slow at times, it kept me interested throughout with raging dialogue, plot twists and intersecting story lines. Here we have a straight arrow plot, yes, with multiple story lines, but barely a crossover. In the beginning we get 1 of many enormously overlong scenes where a Jewish family is slaughtered in 1941 Nazi-occupied France, but one escapes. (The other notable drawn out to the max scene is a barroom conversation that I wanted to scream for it to be over – you knew where it was going, so get on with it! 10 minutes, maybe, but not 30 minutes or so.) Anyways, we get her story later, along with a weasel detective and a group of war-criminals-to-be Nazi killers (see trailer) all leading to a movie screening finale. Good ending, but be prepared for 80% subtitles and 60% fluff to get there.Side Note: Despite it being a 'period piece' movie – where's the jams? I do miss his great soundtracks. Also, never thought I would say this, as I ALWAYS go for the 'unedited' versions of movies on DVD/Bluray. However, I certainly wouldn't mind see the NBC network edited down version. I've already heard the language, seen all the gore. I just would like to see an hour less to get a more tightly plotted and gripping film this could have been.",3,20,46,22 August 2009
Underworld," Under the One
","I can't put my finger on why I was so bored during 'Underworld' (2½/5 Stars). Sure, there's a lot going on, a lot of pretty good FX – EXCEPT for the laughable werewolves (I refuse to call them the 'L' word; call them what they are!) – and mystery aplenty, but I've always been left unsatisfied with this movie. For one, I do like Vampire stories (again, EXCEPT the faux pas vampire story in 'Twilight') but I like the werewolf lore more. This one was supposed to be a blending of both, but get real; this is a 70/30 Vampire/Werewolf story. I guess that might be a good thing considering how horrid the CGI werewolves look. Anyways, the movie's real highlight is the extremely strong character, Selene, played with an excellent performance by Kate Beckinsale. Without her, I doubt I'd have much interest in continuing with the series. The movie obviously directly steals from 'The Matrix' and that's a huge deterrent, as is the constant bending-the-rules for plot development and weighs more heavily on the 'mystery' of the war between the beasts than character development. It also screams sequel – literally. Unless you name your movie 'Episode #' then it shouldn't be so blatant. Barely recommended.",4,2,7,18 January 2012
Kickboxer," Chan's Still the Best Drunken Master
","30th Anniversary: 1989 - the Best Year in Cinema Marathon Film #67/100: 'Kickboxer' (1st Viewing.)To call this movie, even in the 1989 timeline 'predictable' is an insult to single-digit IQ folk. Worse, though, is how boring it was. Mercifully, some of the jokes worked and actually had me laughing and I did enjoy one scene: a drunken Van Damme fighting in a bar. But, aside from those minute positives, I found other ways to occupy my time during this first and only screening of the 'legendary' Kickboxer movie.Such as checking my phone. Playing the Friday the 13th game on said phone. Texting my friend - also phone. And clipping my toenails. I did those manually. Well, with clippers of course. I'm not crazy. Or that agile.What'd be crazy would be to recommend this dull version of revenge and low action for an action movie. Months earlier, enormously superior action films came out giving this lame 'action' film no excuse: License to Kill, Batman, Lethal Weapon 2 and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.So, see what I mean about 1989? Even then, even that same summer: No excuses. This was pure amateur filmmaking and low-key for even the most modest martial arts film. Though it didn't exist back then, it almost felt like this script was written via Google Translator. Total skip.",2,2,4,4 September 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," The One to Bring Back the Balance
","Man, my faith in the force has finally been restored. In the biggest way possible.After four disappointing entries, Disney finally brought the balance back with the very best Star Wars movie since Empire. So we went from the second worst Star Wars movie in 2015 (if you count the Holiday Special as dead last) to the second best just one year later. Rogue One, 'a Star Wars story,' is something barely short of masterpiece filmmaking. Where the copycat The Force Awakens was *supposed* to feed off our nostalgia for the Star Wars universe by bringing back most of the original cast, it failed in creating new and interesting characters with depth, people we cared about and have unique personalities. Rogue One accomplished all that in the first fifteen minutes and by a landslide.I cared about these (new to us) characters. I loved their lines, their chemistry amongst each other, their heart and complexity. While this is all good and I highly praise Rogue One for this, I am sad because this was supposed to be Episode VII's job since that one carries us into the future and this movie was a stand-alone leading right up to Episode IV: A New Hope.Yes, the movie is another prequel and it marks the fourth of eight Star Wars sagas (now excluding the Holiday Special) that has to do with the Death Star. But, damn, the story is rich, the visuals – including the incredible background shots – were absolutely amazing and it was the most original and heartfelt Star Wars movie to date. I even had to battle my own tears back towards the inevitable conclusion.On the simple side, the movie tells the tale of the rebels who fought to bring back the Death Star plans to the Rebellion so Princess Leia, R2D2, et al can exploit the Empire's first of three Death Stars. I knew this synopsis going in and I actually did have hopes after being so let down with The Force Awakens. I just had no idea how much more complex it would be thanks to the expanded and interesting story and characters.I loved this movie from the first couple of minutes, and it just got progressively better and better. It also helped the humor was spot on and had me rolling. Especially from my now second favorite droid, K-2SO just under C-3PO. Since A New Hope began the series as the fourth chapter in 1977, this might be also a good starting point for Star Wars virgins. You literally can begin here and lead yourself into the original classic. The only downfall, with the exception of The Empire Strikes Back, you see the highest quality and best shot film of the series upfront and while some other chapters are still very well made, they do whither in comparison. ***Final thoughts: No spoilers, but one of the best plot points of this movie was that they explained the biggest plot hole from A New Hope, one that people have made fun of for generations. And they do it in great detail. Heck, it's practically the whole movie. Well done.Here's my list from best Star Wars features to least:1. Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back 2. Rogue One 3. Episode IV: A New Hope 4. Episode VI: Return of the Jed-I 5. Episode III: Revenge of the Sith 6. Episode II: Attack of the Clones 7. Episode I: The Phantom Menace 8. Episode VII: The Force Awakens 9. The Holiday Special (are we back to counting this?)",9,2,9,17 December 2016
Captain Marvel," Hardly a Marvel
","God, I love Brie Larson. Loved her in Scott Pilgrim and absolutely agreed with her Oscar for Room. So what the bleep happened here?It is hard to think back to the many, MANY superheroes of the past couple of decades to find a superhero SO plain, SO boring, SO shallow, SO lifeless and without a bit of soul or personality as Brie Larson's Captain Marvel. I had to check to see if George Lucas directed this, because I definitely saw the female Anakin Skywalker here.She was so bad, or her character, at least, she took me completely out of the movie. I never once rooted for her, couldn't care less about her plight and frankly was just waiting for her to end up right where I knew she would thanks to the third Avengers movie. And that's sad, because the movie isn't necessarily a bad one...it's just the title character had none of that Marvel as suggested.Erasing the bore, I loved how the movie was shot. Set in the mid-90s, it, of course, had a kick-ass 90s soundtrack (all of my favorites!!) and the familiar technology and stores from back then. But, bypassing that, the movie FELT like it was shot, edited, paced and scripted like it was from the 1990s. I totally felt transported back to my favorite decade and I praise this movie for that.In a rather quick and easy to follow setup, we learn our title character wants to join an elite group of alien warriors hell-bent on stopping shapeshifters from destroying their protected worlds. Naturally, the one focused on in the movie is Earth and there, our 'hero' has to track the shapeshifters with no other than Nick 'call him' Fury.Sadly, the movie is predictable from minute one and this is not just because it ties into many other MCU films. Normally, that would bother me, but again, the filmmaking all felt really 90s to me, so I'm pretty familiar with the old formulas.Only a select handful of jokes landed, mostly from Sam Jackson and the special effects were good, not great. Too many of the older actors looked fake as younger versions of themselves. Despite that, it was so nice seeing Annette Bening again. It's been far too long.I didn't hate the movie, but will only give it a VERY mild recommendation. If Captain Marvel/Brie Larson wasn't so incredibly and painfully dull, we would've had a MUCH BETTER Marvel outing. It even ended somewhat solidly for her, but not enough to make up for the previous 2-hours of sleepwalking she did.***Final thoughts: Admirable on the opening Marvel Logo and the 1st post-credit scene: totally worth it, especially since it's only 1-2 minutes into the 20-minute end credits. You can absolutely skip the last post-credit scene and just Google it when you get home.",3,30,49,10 March 2019
Coraline," Caro, Cora, Certainly not Bora
","Coraline proves, once again, where Pixar lost its way, Laika always knocks them out of the park.Last year's incredible Kubo and the Two Strings and 2012's ParaNorman should've automatically prompted me to check out the always talked about Coraline. I don't have access to 3D outside the red/blue glasses that comes with movies like Friday the 13th Part III and I was told specifically that this movie needed to be seen in 3D. Not true.Well, yeah, I didn't see it in 3D to completely verify that claim, but I do know if the only reason a movie is good or a must-see is because of a technical aspect or in some cases, a gimmick, then the movie's got problems. This movie might have been even more fun with the visuals popping out, but dang it, I had a complete blast watching it without the additional dimension.Coraline was a marvel at storytelling, visuals, heart and adventure. The art of making these stop-motion films should be an Academy Award on its own for the countless hours, energy and passion the geniuses devoted. I love these kinds of movies 100x more than any CGI cartoon. But, you still need to have a story.Wow, Coraline has the worst of all parents and that sets up for the fantasy of the little girl travelling to Wonderland to meet the duplicated, albeit polar-opposite family and surroundings of her real world. But, if it's too good to be trueWhile many movie's premises slowly gets progressively worse, this movie does the opposite. I did like the movie up front, but as it moved forward, my eyes widened and my soul relished in each new inventive scene, great dialogue and wondrous adventure they had in store for us. This came out in 2009 and as recently as 2016, they're still making them. I am stoked they are. These cannot be easy to make, they keep getting criminally passed up for best Animated Oscars and they usually don't have huge box office receipts. But, if you care about true art being made – in all formats, true spirit in cinema and some of the best and most realistic stories in some of the best and most fantastical realms, you need to check out these Laika beauties. ***Final thoughts: That's two for two for me! What I playfully called my 'Surreal Saturday' movie double feature turned out way better than I had thought. First off was the fantastic Pan's Labyrinth and I followed that with Coraline. Both were first time viewings from me and both 10/10 stars. Now, that was actually a Super Saturday!",10,1,1,12 November 2017
This Is the End," But, What a Way to Go!
","Poor, poor Earth. It's met its doom countless times in the past several years. And recently, it's been more and more END OF TIMES stories hitting theatres.Soyou want to make yet another Armageddon film? Why not create one of the most original concepts for that genre with Seth Rogen, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride and Craig Robinson (plus 20+ others) playing themselves in a send up mocking themselves?While This is the End isn't the best movie I've seen in the stated, now over-used plot, it's one of the most hilarious and entertaining. The concept, alone, of all those mentioned actors (plus, again, 20+ others) playing themselves in a party at the end of days, is worth at least a star or two more than the rest of the film.Said actors all party hard at James Franco's villa, and while the plot initially involves who likes who, who misses who and who just wants to party, the main theme happens when the mysterious blue light takes strangers up to the sky and earthquakes and sink holes swallows others. The remaining actors, and friends, must band together to ward off whatever is causing this massive destruction all around them.Right now, I am granting this movie 4/5 stars and I know whyfor now. While the movie isn't perfect, and has it's dry moments, it's still interesting enough and funny enough to be ranked higher than average.That saidin the future, this movie might improve with age. There are a ton of one-liners, inside jokes and hilarious scenes that I think this movie might grow on me with multiple viewings. It's a harmless film that never takes itself or the subject matter seriously and is only intention is to please.Seriously, that's it. Seth, James, Jonah, Jay, Danny and Craig they all wanted to have a good time and give us one, too. So with any potential 'flaws,' their intentions are pure enough that I know I will like this more with the second and (I guarantee) more viewings.'Seth, that's some of the better acting than I've seen in your last six movies. Where the fvck was that in Green Hornet?' - Danny McBride Well, done, gentlemen.",8,2,7,30 September 2013
Dawn of the Dead," Hell's Full. Get Ready.
","Horror goes in cycles, and as all circles, you always end up where you started. At times, they bombard us with Zombies, then Psychos, then demons, then haunted houses/spirits, etc and back. A few years ago, they did rejuvenate the zombie lore, and none pleased/scared me as much as the 2004 remake 'Dawn of the Dead.' Yes, I loved 'Shaun of the Dead' as well, but that was more dark-humor. 'Dawn' follows very closely the Romero original: All hell breaks loose, literally, one 'dawn' and a group of survivors hold up in a shopping mall to figure out what to do, how to escape, survive and/or get rescued. Gone is the social commentary that had a lot of fans disappointed. Though I am a fan of the original, I wasn't one that was let down. I liked this one for the acting and realistic fear-factor. (In reality, I'd rather be up against Romero's zombies; you could all-but walk past them whereas here, if they see you, it's probably too late.) Polley: I love her! ('Go' is one of my favorites.) She is an excellent actress. Rhames was powerful. But probably the key element was Weber, whose very screen presence was astonishing. The rest of the group wasn't bad, but I think they did try their own social commentary by coincidentally putting all walks of life together, no two alike. It wasn't a perfect movie, but it's one I've seen at least a half-dozen times. Gore, soundtrack (this one introduced me to one of my now all-time-favorite songs: 'The Man Comes Around'), realism and tension all worked for me. Word to the wise: I didn't like to see the epilogue, so if you don't want to know what happens in the aftermath, stop the film when the credits roll.",8,0,1,25 October 2009
Iron Man 2," 2 Much, Man
","Well, I enjoyed the two action sequences in the two plus hours of Iron Man 2.That's an exaggeration, but not by much. It wouldn't be so bad if the plot could sustain the rest and for the most part, it didn't.And that was the biggest problem with Iron Man 2. Along with the poor editing and the excessive character additions, like the original Batman series, the rushed and over bloated storyline really weighed down the movie. Sure, Downey Jr. did his best, and was a real saving grace, but even he had to realize this movie was not up to par.(Spoiler Alert, but needs to be told as it's the majority of the film) Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is dying due to his heart device, acquired in the first Iron Man, that's poisoning his blood. Oh, sorry. That's plot A. Plot B is about the Government wanting the 'Ironman' weapon. C involves a secret spy and her not-a-secret boss from another comic book. As for D and E: two revenge-seeking/Stark hating males for alternate reasons. And F is for the conflicted (and replaced actor) friend of Stark. Did I leave any out? Oh, G is for a Walt Disney-like Daddy along with the normal Daddy-Issues. And H is for Giveaways, Charity, Crossovers and a suicidal daredevil.On a personal note, and I'm generally criticized for this – who cares, it's an opinion, I cannot stand Sam Rockwell. Sure Moon was a somewhat good movie, but it wasn't Rockwell that drove that feature. Here, again, he looked out of place and was just plain boring. Like Downey, Jr., he did try, but had an enormously unsuccessful presence. Despite my personal feelings, still, I got what character he was trying to portray, but we've all seen these evil, revenge-minded and jealous corporate guys at least a dozen times before, but with a tremendous amount of believability, pizazz and villainy that Rockwell didn't come close to possessing. Heck, even the unoriginal and obvious villainous character, Obadiah Stane (played by Bridges from the original Iron Man) had the right qualities Rockwell lacked.Though I have a neutral opinion on Rourke, I sincerely felt him miscast in this role and like Rockwell, overshot his 'bad guy role.' It is written that he spent time (visiting, I suppose) a Russian prison and even more time attempting to learn his Russian lines. He even went as far as wanting to do the whole movie in Russian! (Director Favreau thankfully disagreed – he was hard enough to understand when he did speak English.) In probably the worst scene in the movie was their attempt to recreate the Batman/Joker interrogation scene from The Dark Knight. It didn't work as a rip off, nor as a scene on its own. I forgot to mention the not-at-all-funny bird fetish Rourke's character had was his idea. Perhaps he should come back down to earth after his one-time-only great performance in The Wrestler.The rest of the cast was so-so to great. Favreau was funny but his one-man fight seemed so Lethal Weapon 3'ish while Rushman (Johansson) fought off half a dozen or more men. Speaking of Johansson, or her character Rushman, she was great when she kicked butt. Unfortunately those scenes were even fewer than the overall action of the film. Paltrow was so-so and mirrored Vicky Vale (Basinger from Batman) with the number of screams and over-acting/reacting. As previously mentioned Downey Jr. was excellent and kept his scenes going. In fact, for die-hard Downey Jr. fans, this would be a definite recommendation.Overall, the movie felt rushed (and was,) but thankfully due to the always great Downey Jr., the always impressive technology (loved the suitcase,) crossovers (think shield in addition to S.H.I.E.L.D.) and the (good) few and far between action scenes, the movie's worth a viewing. Not on IMAX as I did – I wouldn't go that far. It's more expensive, it's not in 3-D and you get a letterboxed version of it. In fact, it would not be the end of the world to wait for this enormously inferior sequel to his DVD/Bluray.",4,2,5,9 May 2010
Alien: Resurrection," Alien: Redemption
","Honestly, I wasn't a big fan of Alien: Resurrection when it was first released. I saw it at Harkins Arizona Mills and walked with distaste because, at that time, I was a thorough lover of the Alien³ film. Years later, I would reverse my opinion by simply opening my eyes to the (literal) horror of Alien³ and realizing, despite the 'humor' of Alien: Resurrection, it was 10x the movie part 3 was and a good conclusion of the series.The movie wasn't taking itself too seriously. If it did, it would be very odd for the once-great Ripley character to be spewing lines that only (other Sci-Fi great) Spock would recite. It was fun, scary, adventurous and just enough suspense and originality to be added to any Alien franchise lover's collection.Unfortunately, you kind of have to see the wretched Alien³ to get the background needed: (and believe me, this is a spoiler for those who haven't seen part 3) Ripley's partners from Aliens died, including the young girl, Newt and Ripley gets stranded on Fury 161, a prison planet, but not before being injected with the queen alien. Ripley attempts at destroying the *only* queen by killing it along with herself.200 years and 8 attempts later, the new 'company' of militants, clone her and remove the queen alien in order to spawn more alien warriors for the battle..of a war we've never seen. Anyways, they decide to keep #8, or Ripley, alive and she slowly, but surely, regains some of her memories of her uncloned past. Meanwhile, we have on this cloning ship a group of renegades who brought the hosts to those aliens. They're very rambunctious with this new model Ripley, but all hell breaks loose when the inevitable happens: the aliens, smartly, escape on board.So, here it turns into the past, once again, making this a thankful last chapterthe movie turns to escaping off the ship to avoid being either eaten or harvested for the Queen. Luckily, Ripley (Weaver) keeps it interesting with dialogue and quips and they introduce the NEVER-SEEN-BEFORE alien swimmersnot that that's a big deal.The movie's finale still puzzles meeven after watching this several times. I don't want to spoil it even further, but the two (vague) things that bother me was Ripley's willing to go there and why one character/creature kills another immediately. This could just be me, but I can see why they were trying to change it up at the endeven though it ended just like part one?I have already stated to stay away from the 'Special Edition' of Alien³ and I might have repeated that hereif only for the incredibly awful, 'Men in Black' opening segment. Don't let that discourage you or set the scene for Alien: Resurrection. Simply, get the DVD that contains both, watch the original (theatrical) opening credit scene – though it looks like some Child's Play horror sequel beginning – and then continue on with the rest of the special edition. Seriously, the MIB terrible 'special' edition should be avoided, while the rest is just fine.It's a watchable movie, with some really funny lines and scenes – I loved the 'it was in my way' bit. It's nowhere near the caliber as Alien or Aliens and it's 10x higher than Alien³but it's worth a viewing to complete the series.Side Note: (spoiler) Once again, they kill off one of the best characters almost immediately. In Alien³ the doctor was axed prematurely and Newt, Bishop and Hicks earlier. Here, it was the captain, Frank (Wincott)he got the same quick fate. Yeah, I get this is not supposed to be a bed of roses, but come on, for oncelet someone other than Ripley prevail.",7,1,2,23 January 2011
World War Z," World War Zooooom!!
","If trailers ruled the worldI would never have seen this movie.I love zombie movies, TV shows, satires, etc. But, I do not like zombies that can run faster than both Superman and The Flash combined. And there you have it, World War Z: Supersonic Zombies.Call me old fashioned, but it's scarier and more suspenseful when they zombies were mindless corpses who barely could walk and, yet, could still sneak up on you. The one exception I will make is 2004's remake: Dawn of the Dead. Sure, they were fast and vicious, but the cast and the story clearly made up for the fast-forwarded zombies.Here, in the adaptation of the book it's based on, IN NAME ALONE, Hero Gerry Lane travels the world in search for answers to this zombie outbreak and continuously bypasses a single bite or multiples of unrealistic tragedies. In fact, he survives so many times, this might as well been the more realistic version of Roland Emmerich's 2012 film.Now, I'll be honest: I did have a somewhat good time here, despite the endless clichés, the lack of Rated-R Zombie gore and the 300 mph running, ant-like zombies. It just missed the mark so many times, that I can't wait to read the book that this is, again, IN NAME ONLY, based on.Truthfully, I have NOT read the book, but from all the fans I've heard from, this movie adaptation has extremely little, or 2%, of what the book was all about. And that's too bad. This only makes me want to read that novel and forget any of this ever happened. Maybe, they'll do what they did to the HULK, quickly remake it in a few years to what it was supposed to be in the first place.Specifically targeting the movie, it was 'okay.' Some hokey scenes, such as the jail lose-yer-teeth chapter or ANY presentation of a zombie going the speed of light, brought this movie down. So much so, I think there almost could've been an award-winning film here. But, no. This is just above B-Movie average and left a lot to be desired by the zombie-loving crowds.Side Note: When I saw the trailer for this movie, and I had never heard there was a book this was based on, I was excited. UntilI saw the zombie were both running faster than a tornado's force and then building an 'ant pile' against a wall. I literally could not stop laughing, and I doubt that was the reaction they had in mind when they made the preview.",4,3,6,30 September 2013
The Hunger Games," The Running Girl
","There have been a lot of comparisons between the new series of The Hunger Games and the Twilight (so-called) 'saga' lately, and I'm not innocent of avoiding paralleling the two. Well, the moment The Hunger Games begins, those unfair similarities should be tossed. The two franchises are as close as the Star Wars episodes and The Alien films.While The Hunger Games isn't perfect by any means measurable, it's light-years ahead of the Twilight duds. Better acting, dialogue, suspense, action, emotion, heart and special effects are just the tip of the iceberg on how much better The Hunger Games is, but then again, that's just denouncing the comparison.So, I digress. The Hunger Games has really only one major thing going for it which is actually making me encourage all to see it: Jennifer Lawrence (or J-Law.) The actress herself and her fantastic character of Catnip, er, Katniss are worth the price alone. I already liked her tremendously in Winter's Bone and come to think about it, I believe I said the exactly the same thing about that movie. So-so movie, EXCELLENT performance, so much so: everyone should see it just for her.Other than J-Law, this movie was really...eh. Yes, the cinematography was splendid – WHEN THE CAMERA WASN'T SHAKING all around when no one else was – and some of the effects were pretty decent. But, damn, was it ever slow, predicable and has the most LOL vision of the future. I literally did laugh out loud every time the clowns of the future were on screen.Before any fans shoot arrows at me, I have NOT read any of the books. But, even if these ugly and unnecessary 1960s Star Trek rejected costumes and makeup designs were in the source material that does NOT mean they have to be in the feature film. I mean, if the screenplay writer or director didn't update certain characters/costumes, Robin of Batman Forever/& Robin would look pretty...well, molestable from the much older Bruce Wayne. And the X-Men even commented on the ridiculous yellow suits and look how great they turned out. Well, for the first two installments, at any rate.(Sadly, they failed to hear this kind of complaint for Captain America in the forthcoming Avengers movie. Hey! There's still time to edit out that hilarious uniform, Disney. This goes for you, too, Thor!)Anyhoo, what I am guessing is hundreds of years into our future, the reality TV show lives on (THANKS, America) only this one has the kids killing other kids. As much as I'm against that, if Jersey Shore stole this idea, I would finally watch my very first episode of that awful MTV show. Repeatedly.Not really a spoiler – seen a movie trailer lately? – but Catnip volunteers/sacrifices herself in place of her weakling sister for this wooded and hologram'med death match of 2 younglings from each of the 12 districts (why the aliens from #9 didn't participate is beyond me.) She leaves behind an obvious love choice and must fight/help a new love choice (Dang, there's that Twilight comparison again) in order to survive the 'game' of life.The idea's not new (The Running Man anyone?), but this new horror of kid on kid deadly violence is. This absolutely should've been Rated R and be more serious. 'Course, they wouldn't make the money they'll know they'll make by copping out to the PG-13 crowds.In all seriousness, this has a VERY violent movie premise and whenever the movie tried to make some lite comment or joke, I barely laughed because it's like making a teeny-bopper movie about everyone being a rapist or molester, but everyone still can enjoy a few laughs from time to time.Also, as I mentioned, it was slower than it should've been, felt very much like the first in a series and seemed to take far too long to get to the actual 'Games' than it should've been. All along, I felt this was a perfect prequel movie that should've been the fourth film – à la The Hobbit after we're already invested in the series.Okaythat all saidagain, it's worth a viewing due to the absolutely Oscar-nomination-worthy performance of J-Law – who delivered the only unpredictable aspect of this movie (I never knew which way her character would sway while all other characters or scenes were A-B-C) and maaaybe a consideration for Woody Harrelson, whom I normally don't like, but did great here. No one and I mean no one – even the VERY cute guys – did great, but they were 16-acting-classes ahead of Robert 'Eerie Edward' Pattinson, Kristen 'Blah Bella' Stewart and Taylor 'Jake the Dog' Lautner of the Twilight series. Oops, sorry about bringing that up again. See? I'm not immune to the comparisons.And finally, the movie, quite honestly, grabbed my attention enough that I really, really look forward to part II. No spoilers because I haven't read the novels, but I strongly want one of my new favorite characters, Catnip, to take down the establishment. The ideas, though preposterous, are sadly and minutely accurate (ah hem, Nazis or Republicans, you pick) of a possible and tyrannous outlook of mankind. They're horrifying, although, if this were a 1980s/1990s action flick starring Arnold or Sylvester, the 'man' would've been taken down by now.Since that isn't the case and this wasn't made 20-30 years ago (though you would believe it was with the costumes, makeup and hair), I'm really looking forward to seeing my new heroine take on Kiefer's dad and put an end to the games. You go gurl!",5,0,3,21 January 2013
The Impossible," Impossible Missions
","Aside from all I read about the changes to the 'real' true story of the family portrayed in The Impossible, the movie did manage to move me in spots. Of course, that was the main reason for the movie, I believe.The movie is a real straight forward account of a family of Christmas breakers at a holiday resort swept away, literally, by a tsunami they had absolutely no chance of escaping or could possibly know was on its way. Not only must that be scary, but they surely showed how caught off guard they were and what anyone of us would experience.The remaining story is the family either staying together or separating and trying to get back together in one Hallmark moment after the next. Really, I'm not trying to downplay their plight, and again, the movie truly got me going at a few scenes. But, then that seemed more its mission than to tell a great story.To me, it might have been even more moving had a story been told about a completely less fortunate family or islander's struggles. This family was wealthy and had the grand fortune of the mother being a doctor. And I don't want to spoil the ending, but damn, I felt incredibly less sorry for these folks once you see the privilege they had compared to all the less financially backed families 'our heroes' left behind.(Just the next paragraph is a spoiler. If you object, skip just one paragraph.)Example: with so many either dying, infected, in agony or had dead family members, this family of 5 take up an entire plane to go get 'top medical' help in another country, when so many seats could've been used to help those left behind to rot or die. If that ending doesn't p|ss you off on how little they did or what could've been done to aid even just a few dozen more victims, then your heart is in the wrong place.SPOILER OVER. Okay, the movie wasn't too bad, and mercifully, very quick. That was probably because there was so little build up, and even less plot during. But, if you're looking for an intentional tear-jerker, this is your Lifetime movie for a Saturday night.",5,1,3,26 February 2013
Shaun of the Dead," Fond of the Dead
","Taking a satire and turning it into a real movie takes an incredible amount of talent, all-around. Sure, everyone, including me, loves Simon Pegg and his (best) boyfriend, Nick Frost, and they get huge credit, on screen, in turning Dawn of the Dead's spoof Shaun of the Dead into a raging success, even by today's standards. But, it was mainly the writing by both Pegg and (also, Director) Edgar Wright.I used to be a huge spoof fan, until 2000's Scary Movie, one of my all-time favorite comedies, put an end to actual funny spoofs. Four years later, unbeknownst by me, came Shaun of the Dead, another great parody. I didn't know about it because it fell far under my radar and I probably didn't see this the first time until 5-6 years later. Just recently, (8/31/13) I watched it for the second time.I am fully aware this lands on a ton of people's top list, and I truly liked it, myself, but I wouldn't go as far to land it in my top whatever list. Okay, maybe spoofs, since there's so few really good ones, but that's about it.My only real problem is the movie runs out of breath in the last act. Gore replaced comedy in the last third and yeah, it's to remind us this is *also* a zombie movie. But, to me, it felt more like they ran out of jokes and lost focus on what the first two-thirds were all about.That said, the first two acts were fantastic. Absolutely hilarious and ingenious use of both comedy and the zombie genre, all with deadpan deliveries. Basically, Shaun (Pegg) lives the same droll life and this is affecting his relationship with his girlfriend, but not so much his (best) boyfriend, Ed (Frost.) Unfortunately, for the threesome – eh, maybe also the world, a zombie outbreak occurs and, not coincidentally, mirrors Shaun's existence.There were many opportunities to exploit the potential humor in a zombie outbreak film, and I doubt writers Pegg and Wright missed a single one. Leading up to our heroes finding out what's going on, and a little beyond the acknowledgment, it was one hilarious scene following the next. Mercifully, they chose the (much preferred by me) slow-moving zombies in order to give the cast a lot more time to give us more entertainment.If you haven't yet seen this, and are a fan of zombie films, or even dislike them and would like to see them ridiculed, this is your movie. It is also the teaming of Pegg and Frost's absolute best film, even though they would make a couple more enjoyable flicks.Gotta love lines like: 'We're coming to get you, Barbara!' – Ed.",8,2,4,28 September 2013
Argo," Who's Argoing to See This?
","Strange. Two CIA/Military films nominated for the 2012 Best Picture Oscars are from the past. Albeit, Zero Dark Thirty's past is a tad bit – 20-30 years – sooner, both that and Argo recount U.S.A.'s 'barely achievable' Middle-Eastern's undercover missions of glory.Here, in Argo, after a series of unforgivable and bad decisions, a sextet of Americans are hiding out in the Canadian Embassy's home in 1980 Iran while their peers are captured and tortured. Argo shows a man's plight to bring them – JUST THE SIX, mind you – home via a fake movie.The scheme, CIA operative Tony Mendez, constructs seems so implausible, so expensive and so elaborate, that it couldn't possibly work and without surprise, of course it would. Or they wouldn't have made this movie.Mendez convinces his government peers to fund a lie of a Sci-Fi movie – that strongly reminded me of the awful film, Gentlemen Broncos, to get himself into war-torn Iran to rescue those mostly defiant six U.S. Embassy over-stayed Canadian 'houseguests' and morons. Given what I saw recently in Zero Dark Thirty, too bad the technology wasn't with us back then to avoid just a grand concoction just to free these completely uninteresting, selfish and endlessly whining folkand never mind the other countless hostages not living under a great roof, not being well-fed and well stacked with cigarettes.Now, this all said, I didn't dislike the film that much. I did care for the extreme details Director Affleck paid attention to. And when you already know how this is going to play out, even without knowing the background – like I didn't, it was rather suspenseful towards the end. It was definitely 'On-the-edge-of-your-seat' finale.One thing though: I lived through 1980, and of course, since I'm writing this today, the rest of the 1980s. I hated the style back then. Yuck. Even as realistic as they make these 1980s period piece films, it's so hard for me to like them. Even when I experienced these years, I couldn't wait to get out of that decade.Neither here, nor there. The movie is a good watch, although it didn't deserve the Best Golden Globe Picture award. But, hopefully will be enjoyed by some while not being praised as 'the Best Picture' of the year.",6,0,0,17 January 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Pirate.
","This movie will always hold a special place in my heart. Way back in 2003, while on an island (San Juan Island, WA to be exact,) my then- boyfriend and I checked out the only movie theatre on the isle. Personally, I didn't want to see Pirates of the Caribbean, but it was either that or Legally Blonde 2: Red, White and Blonde since the movie theatre only had two screens. And while I saw part one of that, I was even less interested in seeing that. So, with only two screens, two choices, we opted for Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.Now, this movie had been out for awhile, and everyone raved about it. Still, even with the draw of both Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom, as well as the vast positive feedback, I was hesitant going in. BOYwas I wrong. This movie grabbed me from minute one and never let loose. From the incredible score to the excellent special effects – that STILL hold up today in 2015 to the fantastic characters, this proved to be an instant classic. (To clarify, 12 years later, that statement holds true.) It was extreme adventure, with plenty of action, humor and perfect blend of gray areas for the good/bad guys. Now, the follow-ups, including the 2 that completed the 'trilogy' and the stand alone featureI implore you: DON'T WATCH THEM. I've currently seen this original 3-4x, but the subsequent ones, one time apiece and pretty much despised them. They were FAR TOO LONG and clunky. Granted, Captain Jack Sparrow is a once in a lifetime character, but he should only be enjoyed in small doses, such as this original chapter. The lines were hilarious, the cast/characters great on their own and the action was exciting. The Disneyland ride happens to be my favorite exhibit at Disneyland (even before the movie,) and they took that, plus the awesome Yo-Ho! song to lengths that couldn't be achieved in lesser hands. Again, avoid the sequels and buy this fantastic adventure. It seriously can be stand-alone, and should've. * * *Final thoughts: Of all of our memories together, Justin, this always stands out. Despite not being one of the biggest events in our time together, the time we went to this small, 2-screen, island duplex, will forever be etched into my memory. Thank you for opening my mind to this film and experience.",9,0,1,20 June 2015
Star Trek Into Darkness," IIb or Not IIb
","I guess the secret(s) are out. When IMDb reports major film spoilers just in the credits, it's safe to say: few surprises are left with Star Trek Into Darkness.But, that doesn't mean I have to (or will) spoil anything. The fun for me was finding out the few surprises along the way, enjoying some new twists and reminiscing about the Star Trek film franchise's past. Sort of past, that is.The movie looked gorgeous and mercifully, Abrams scaled back tenfold on the lens flares. I'll pause for a minute. I never actually noticed them until I heard a few (dozen) complaints about the overuse of them in the 2009 film. Recently, while getting hyped for this, I revisited that film and I can see now with open eyes. Or sore eyes; there had to be 300 of them! Here, in 2013, he's learned his lesson. For the most part, anyways.Aside from the great cinematography and special effects that went hand-in-hand, the score was rich, though not as great as the 2009 tracks. But, in contrast, the actors really became their roles and were much more fleshed out, with the exception of Uhura, than the previous installment.Unfortunately, the problems I had, though few, were big enough for me not to escape. The plot staggered and never felt completed. The movie seemed to be all over the place at points and left enough black hole sized wrongs that I could not ignore. To state them would be the spoiler I advised I would not share. Also, the pacing was far off at points and the movie certainly went on much longer than it should have. And finally, the villain was just incrediblyblah. I will simply not compare this villain to the one everyone whose seen this knows who I'm referring to, but that other villain was ten times the character that Benedict Cumberbatch played here.Despite the step downs from the 'original' 2009 near-masterpiece, the movie is a lot of fun and absolutely funny, thanks to Bones and Scotty. The movie also has a huge amount of heart at points, especially one scene towards the (overly long) finale that I couldn't help but choke up at.Jim Kirk has since settled in his role as the Enterprise captain and is trying his best to make sure everyone knows he doesn't follow the rules – any rule, that is, when a new threat emerges in the form of one strong male. Apparently, this one villain can take on the entire Star Fleet without any assistance. But, luckily, we have plenty of disposable and expendable officers to attempt to match this one bad guy.Along the way, we get more depth of the bromance between Kirk and Spock and that's a lot of fun. We get some absolute laugh-out-loud moments, terrific battles, a whole lot of people running all over the place and an unwelcomed/overused cameo.So, as you can tell, from every couple of positives I find, more equally puzzling and negative opinions. That said, it did range above the 5-star dead even average to 6 stars out of 10.I think it's going to be a must-see on BluRay. And repeatedly, until the (hopefully more fleshed out) Part III hits theatres.",6,0,5,19 May 2013
Stripes," sMASHed
","I'm guessing this movie worked better in 1981, for this is my first time seeing it and I fell asleep twice since yesterday trying to get through it. Not that it was terrible, though it was terribly long. It had its funny moments, but not the laugh-out-loud funny Bill Murray I was hoping for. And I can see which audience this was perfect for and in the early 1980s, it was probably perfect for themjust not in 2015.(I really didn't have much more to say, but I guess I have to pad this review for this site.)",3,7,14,19 July 2015
Beauty and the Beast," Such a Belle after All These Years
","You know, two of the best aspects of Disney's version of Beauty & the Beast, seemed small and insignificant to most, but have stuck with me since I saw this in 1991. #1 They freely admit that this is a 'tale as old as time' – they're not hiding that fact and #2 they're also completely up front with stating 'she's the one' to break the curse, i.e. they don't make us wait until the end (LIKE MOVIES DO ALL THE TIME) to reveal what we've known from minute one. I respect that.Those are just two things of, I dunno, 50 great things about this near-masterpiece of filmmaking. A beautiful score, fantastic and timeless songs, gorgeous cinematography, hilarious dialogue and 'sidekicks' and secondary characters, a story very moving, strong leads, adventure, suspense, love, funthis movie is all of those plus so much more.Watching it (for the 20th+ time but) now in the usual-Disney 'We Want Even More of Your Dollars' way, the re-release, of course in 3D, it still held up for me. My friend and I in the theatre were rocking back and forth with the wonderful musical segments while mouthing the words – trying desperately, albeit probably failing, not to disturb other movie-goers.I will say this, despite my 10/10 Star ratingthe movie did look 21 years old, unfortunately. Some of the background characters did not move while the foreground was in motion. This was, sadly, unintentionally humorous. That said, I am a huge supporter of hand-drawn animation, or, movies people put their heart, soul, sweat & tears in VS clicking the mouse. This was old-school animation and I am fine with that. I just think this was better served, in 2012, at home to appreciate.Sure, I love re-watching classics or even movies I just like a lot, on the silver screen, but this wasn't one of those. Anyone that knows me knows I do like 3D, but I have NOT seen a single Disney 3D movie that impressed me. Especially converted ones. The ONLY good 3D imagery here was the rain & snow, and I said the same thing about The Nightmare Before Christmas's re-release in 3D. Sad, there were a lot more 3D to choose from, but I ONLY liked the rain & snow which, to me, was the only 3D that had depth.So I will NOT recommend this to be seen in theatres. I will NOT go see another Disney Classic on the big screen converted to 3D and I am no longer upset I missed The Lion King's same 3D re-issue last year. I will, however see Finding Nemo's 3D re-release later this year for several reasons: I DO NOT consider that Disney, it's my favorite Pixar film – though I haven't seen it since the original release in 2003 and the less than 2 minute preview before Beauty & the Beast looked far better in 3D than ALL of Beauty & the Beast. (On a side note, it's absolutely easier to convert that – it was 100% digital and computerized.)Stick with this classic on BluRay. I just hope they put that fantastically hilarious Tangled Ever After short (shown before this movie in the theatre.) It was a lot of fun and had us cracking up.For the movie itself: 10/10 Stars. For the 3D conversion: 2/10 Stars.",10,6,7,14 January 2012
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," She Said, He Said, Repeat
","Another fantastic comedy did 2011 produce with Crazy, Stupid, Love. Too bad, I don't flock to see comedies in the theatre too often or I would've enjoyed this one a lot sooner.Some old concepts rolled into one movie get a breath of fresh air thanks to fantastic writing, humor, characters and acting. Everyone involved put their 100% in; everyone had realistic reactions and moved this almost two-hour movie to feel like it flew by.Most notable was Ryan Gosling. He plays the clichéd womanizer, but does it with such depth and ease; you'll both love him and hate him simultaneously. It's no wonder he recently was nominated for a Golden Globe for this performance.Too bad Steve Carell was snubbed, though. Sure, he plays his typical mopey self, but he does make you feel for him every step of the way. And though his scenes with Gosling were great, his comic timing and lines with Julianne Moore were priceless. She laughs at his lines – that's her character queues – but it almost seems genuine, like she didn't expect them and laughed like the rest of us did.This isn't to take away from everyone else. I always have a special place in my heart for Emma Stone. Let's just say: everyone, including the love struck son, Robbie played by Jonah Bobo, did a fantastic job.Immediately into the feature, it's announced Emily Weaver (Moore) wants a divorce after 20+ years of marriage to Cal (Carell). He flips, literally – out of a moving vehicle, moves out of their home and begins anew at the bar. There he's courted by Jacob (Gosling) into the art of picking up women.The movie's a lot more complicated than that with multiples layers and other characters and how they love their own interests as well as react amongst themselves. And despite the web spun from one corner to the next, the movie masterfully never strays too far and stays on track.Great movie, incredibly funny and touching, it's an absolute must see. One of the best of 2011.",9,1,2,16 December 2011
Green Room," Definitely Not Easy Being Green
","For once, the trailer didn't ruinanything.A while ago, despite my strong objections, a friend made me watch a Red- band trailer for Green Room. After which, I was p|ssed having felt like I've seen it all, like most trailers do ruin most, if not all surprises and tell me more about the movie that I wanted to know. Thank God, this was the exception to the rule.(Now, that was months ago since I saw the trailer and I just re-watched it to see if my memory served me well. And, true, it still doesn't give away a tenth of the movie, it's still best just to watch the movie cold.)This movie was not only incredible, but surpassed my expectations tenfold. I am not going to spend one second here giving a synopsis or what made it great or what surprised me. As mentioned, best to go in cold and you must see this movie.That said, but still no spoilers, I will reveal it's basically both a thriller and horror and possibly one of the most original of either genre in years. It's small and contained and with or without a large budget, it works perfectly this way.I hate to not go into what I felt made the movie wonderful or even a small summary. But, suffice to say, if you love thrillers, horrors, get emotional on hot topics and can take the heat, WATCH THIS MOVIE NOW. It's easily one of the best of 2016 and I doubt it will fall out of my top 10 if not my top 5 by year's end.***Final thoughts: Probably more horrific that the horror I mentioned in this movie is the incredibly sad news that the lead, Anton Yelchin, just recently passed away abruptly at age 27JUST 10 days ago from this viewing and my review. R.I.P. Anton. Watching you here, giving a great performance and knowing what just happenedcan tear me up. Did tear me up.",9,6,14,29 June 2016
Happy Gilmore," Don't Look Now, I'm Finally Happy
","A follow-up to his miserable Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore is actually one of Adam Sandler's best comedies he's done. Maybe they got the right script, the correct director or just that Sandler dropped his loud, incoherent, obnoxious and incomprehensible gibberishÂ…a ton worked here and I found myself actually (and FINALLY) laughing out loud in one of his comedies.I do my best to keep an open mind during any movie, and I devoted this weekend to spend more time with Sandler's more well-known films I hadn't seen. Even though, I didn't have high expectations for this. It didn't help, the opening credits were fairly lame and I thought: here we go again. But, then, the comedy began to work with Sandler's first couple of strokes of the golf balls. I started to uncontrollably laugh and enjoyed myself for the remainder of the flick.Granted, it's not the most original movie, and it relied on the usual antics, movie tricks and clichÃ©s. Still, I enjoyed the ride despite knowing how it would play out.Sandler works best when he doesn't lower himself to sudden, expected and whiney outbursts. Much like modern-day Melissa McCarthy; when she's not 'Tammy,' she's pretty damn funny. If I hadn't just now watched this movie for the first time in 2015, I would've had a renewed faith in Sandler, despite his already failing grade in 1996. Unfortunately, he would continue to make an enormous amount of garbage that would certainly make his movies a(n unintentional) laughing stalk in the industry. That all said, he's had a few gems, and I completely recommend this one.",7,3,3,27 July 2015
Us," Put Your Hands Together
","I'd call this 'US vs. THEM,' but, spoiler; there are no giant ants in this film.And speaking of spoilers...THIS IS THE #1 REASON I WON'T WATCH TRAILERS (before seeing the movie.) I saw the movie last night, watch the trailer now and it basically showed you the whole movie to the end.I love going into movies cold. I just need a recommendation. I did know this was Jordan Peele's follow-up to the great Get Out, *may be* horror and I saw one movie still. I avoided everything else and SOOO GLAD I DID. Incidentally, I did the same to Hereditary, and both that movie and this were two fantastic horror-movie going experiences.So, I would suggest doing the same here. Go in cold and I am refraining from giving a synopsis like I normally do. This movie is SUPER hard to describe without giving too much away, anyway.I will say this: this movie is fantastic. Peele's been up to bat twice as Writer/Director and hit two, record-breaking home runs. I freaking cannot believe how great Get Out was and as I think more about Us, I do believe this is actually better.Once again, he writes an amazing and absolutely original script - even when he takes from so many horror subgenres. While I was watching this, I was writing my review in my head and kept comparing this movie to (this) movie and then I thought: Oh! It's also like (that) movie. Once again, to tell you which movies I saw within this one would be a spoiler.I know I'm being vague here and you don't know me from Adam (but, I hope you do, by now.) This film is for both film and horror lovers. It's a wonderful throwback WITHOUT that forced nostalgia Hollywood has been cramming down our throats. And *that* is another praise for Peele.So, buckle up, go and see Us. Also see Get Out if you haven't already and be prepared to pre-purchase a ticket to Peele's next feature as this guy's got an incredible future ahead of him.***Final thoughts: Warning: Do NOT drink beer before or during. But, if you do, pee before the movie starts. I had to 10 min into this 2-hours experience and that's NOT how to view this great of a movie.",9,6,13,24 March 2019
The Danish Girl," Girl, Interpreted
","Man, he feels like a woman. As some men doI can see where this was going. And what a lot of original men and women had to go through when they were originally deposited in the wrong body/sex. This showed the easy side – the people who had money and time to help out plus the society that did accept with the exception of one partial beating.1920s Danish Dude wants to be a Lady, but has a complicated married life to stand in his alter-ego ways. Mercifully, he has major support from said wife and those around him.The performances, sets and direction were spot on, but there wasn't much here to entice me. I've seen versions of this before and with a more incredible script. For what they did and tried to accomplish, I applaud them. I'm just not fully recommending it.***Final thoughts: I'd like to see more. I'd like to see the original story of the first patient who went through gender reassignment. I know this is fiction, and I'm not always keen on the non-fiction stuff, but the truth about this might have been more fitting here.",5,2,3,17 January 2016
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Lara Would Kick Sand in This Prince's Face
","How Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time didn't end up as direct-to-DVD cartoon is beyond me.It was, in fact, an all-but cartoon, with thousands, make that MILLIONS of CGI clips; it's almost like watching a cartoon. Now, that's so the (probably near-bankrupt) Disney can make a buck on something they probably weren't too sure of. Uh, like Mars Needs Moms? Too soon?Now, it's not all bad. It's entertaining if you leave your brain on a magic carpet by the door, and know the source material. Only, I played thee original Prince of Persia – as early as 1989 and not the ho-hum remake of every other desert adventure that's out there. I've seen the previews – of the updated game that is – and a lot of shots of this movie version does look a lot like it. So, kudos to them for keeping with the (times and) video game.But, it's also not all that good. What starts off with enormous plot elements thrown at us as well as what seems like 50 different locales that you're supposed to 'get' up front, ends up with the age-old story, in an age-old Iran – formally Persia.Oh, and before I go furthercan someone please remove the 'SIR' before Ben Kingsley's name? Seriously, the ratio of bad movies to good outweighs the number of good Friday the 13th movies.So Persia wants to rule the world and an 'Aladdin'-type Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) is the adopted son of the King and has two brothers and an Uncle (unsir Ben Kingsley.) Side note: I would like to call this Uncle after another 'Uncle' from another Disney classicbut that would be too much of a spoiler. Though, if you don't see that coming, you have never, ever seen a movie before, let alone played a video game beyond the Super Nintendo. (Heck, let's say the Sega Genesis.)Anyways, King Daddy dies and Dastan is destined to be accused. Meanwhile, he's in possession of a switchblade (of sorts) thatwait for itcontrols the sands of time. Well, for a minute at least. Meanwhile, Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton) wants the cutting-through-time knife back. And it does, in fact, go back and forth between the two leads so many times, you'd think this was Groundhog Day.Oh, and the evil one(s) also want the sharpy thing. (See how I'm not taking this seriously?) And neither should the audience. The movie's just an excuse to throw cheesy (and obvious) CGI-controlled scenes at you in both rabid and slooo-mo (Also see: The Matrixwait, aren't we 12 years past yet another Matrix-rip-off?)I'll repeat (one part, at least): It's not all that bad. It's entertaining enough just as mindless action, but with zero depth, originality or creativity. You can just watch it because there hasn't been an Indiana Jones, Mummy or Lara Croft reboot in the works recently. Speaking of which, Prince of Persia doesn't even come close to those movies (okay, maybe Lara Croft: The Cradle of Life and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull – it's certainly on par with those.) Heck, even the mostly-bland National Treasure movies are better.And that's all too bad. You can tell Jake put his heart into this; I'm sure he worked out at the gym for more hours than he put in for Brokeback Mountain. But, sadly, he also put his time into a tired script with a truly foreseen finale that takes way too long to get to and yet another movie Kingsley phoned his performance in.

Ted," Naked Bear Alert!
","Perhaps I wanted to like Ted more, but regardless of my expectations, I laughed out loud more times during this than most movies I've seen in two years. And though the audience also laughed, I think I was the loudest.It's doubtful they got most of the jokes; Seth MacFarlane's humor is mostly targeting one generation – specifically mine and, well, his.Stepping aside from the endless references, this is the closest Family Guy movie we can count on. For now.As with most little tyke 'I wish for' movies, Ted(dy) bear (MacFarlane) comes to life for a young boy, John and thanks to this gift, the little boy, now a large boy, never grows up. Even during his fourth year with the stunning Lori (Mila Kunis,) John (Mark Wahlberg) continues to smoke a lot of weed, skips on advancing his life and complies with all Ted's wishes.Not that, that's a bad thingWell, maybe the age old story that wraps around the movie, but I guess they felt they had to go that route to make a feature length.Note to Seth: you can spend 30 seconds or less developing a plot and the remaining 95% in complete chaos. Much like the movie you spoofed that spoofed other movies. (No spoiler from me. Someone else spoiled it for me – SHAME!)Anyways, that 'storyline' almost led to its downfall with the terrible pacing and long stretches of nothingness. Thankfully, Ted returns to the screen, and literally saves the movie each and every time. He also reminds us not to take this all too seriously, for the most part, and I liked that.And this movie. It's offensive – to some – I'm sure, but then, those closed minded individuals need not see this movie. I don't want to look at naked breasts so I'm not buying a Hustler magazine, even though they do not offend me like most guys get put off by seeing naked dudes.Not to cut this short – I really don't want to spoil the jokes, cameos or scenarios any further. I highly recommend this movie, for fans of Family Guy AND American Dad and those who like real humor that doesn't hold back on the swearing or racial jokes in fear of alienating bigots. And I look forward to purchasing this on BluRay and having a little party to revisit all the incredibly funny scenes. Like The Fighter fighting. I was ROLLING with that scene. Priceless.",8,1,4,3 March 2013
Knives Out," I Had No Clue
","Most shocking conclusion: Jamie Lee smoked!!Sorry if that gave away a bit too much, but in reality, it was so minor to the story, I'm shocked it was even included. In real life, however, this is everything. See, Jamie Lee Curtis is so against smoking, she once said that anyone who chooses to smoke doesn't deserve medical insurance.I used to smoke, for 22 years. Been clean for 2 years and 3 months tomorrow. But, when I heard her say this, I was smoking and was pissed that she obviously didn't understand addiction. And then...it all came out about HER addiction. Not to nicotine, but something else. No...not yogurt. So, maybe this was her way of saying she understands and her earlier statement is wrong.I digress. This whodunit with so many incredible actors - yes, including Jamie Lee, whom I do love, was equally wonderful. I love this kind of quirky mystery and they don't make 'em like they used to.I went into this so cold, I barely knew 5% of this film. I felt and was right about the theme and mood. But the twists and how it would play out: a complete mystery to me. And should be to you, as well.Relish in great acting, tongue in cheek atmosphere and just have fun trying to solve it yourself as I did and then find yourself completely wrong. Yes, watch yourself get so tied up and think it's so obvious, you'll be pleasantly surprised.Also, it's not a Clue remake. I thought it was when it was announced and when the trailers came out. I mean, I guess it COULD be an homage to the movie/board game Clue, but it's not. Enjoy it for the fun, funny and mystery it is.***Final thoughts: On my one and only cruise, last day, before we were debarking, I was in the elevator to get the level where I could go out and smoke. (See? I used to, back then anyways.) I saw a woman traveling with me in the lift and I was floored. It WAS Jamie Lee Curtis, I swore to myself. When I did a double/triple take with her, she smiled at me as if she knew I knew it was her. Anyways, she ended up at the same place as I was at: the outdoor smoking deck and she smoked. It was right then and there I knew: it couldn't be her. She was so anti-smoking, this couldn't be the real Jamie Lee.Now, after watching this movie...the case has officially been reopened.",8,0,2,24 June 2020
Spider-Man 2," A Nearly Flawless Super-Hero Movie
","Despite #1 being a very good movie, 'Spider-Man 2' falls under the 'Surprisingly Better' sequels. Now, that's not to say, #2 didn't have its problems. It did, including one lingering from #1 (pacing,) but overall, they moved forward with the series. And in high-speed.Already established web-slinger, do-gooder, Spider-Man continues his plight in saving kids and punishing criminals all the while getting beaten up (emotionally) as Peter Parker. In fact, they show more than enough of his beat-downs. We get it already – he's a nerd that everyone takes advantage of.At any rate, he's still pursuing both MJ (Dunst,) who's now engaged to a more 'stable' astronaut and Dr. Otto Octavius all the while, he's avoiding best friend (of Pete)/mortal enemy (of Spidey) Harry (Franco.) To make matters worse, his mother's losing her home, Pete's losing his apartment, Doc Ock's becoming an eight-limbed crazed scientist and he's getting Spidey-blocked, or unable to use his powers as his mind's overloaded.There's actually a lot more, but that's for the viewer to see. Don't want to give away everything. Suffice to say, Pete's got a lot on his mind. Thankfully, they've up'd the villain-scale with Dr. Octopus played brilliantly by (unknown to me at the time) Alfred Molina. He ranks as one of the best on-screen villains of all time. His quiet tone, brilliant mind and attitude and mannerisms, especially being attached to 4 additional limbs, made him quite believable despite his appearance. Side Note: Doc Ock was always my favorite Spider-Man villain, and since they did a great job, this is my favorite Spider-Man movie, by a long shot.Hopefully most people picked up on the operation scene, when they tried to rid Dr. Octavius of his metal contraptions and how it was an absolute perfect homage to Raimi's previous work. That was so 'Evil Dead' that, though it was hard to watch, especially the nail scrape, I was so impressed that he came back to his roots vs. the main-stream 'Spider-Man' had become. If you don't believe me, split screen the chainsaw with 'Evil Dead 2' and 'Army of Darkness.' There are a lot of excellent action sequences, tension and fun to be had in 'Spider-Man 2.' (The train scene, itself, is worth admission.) Nevertheless, the movie should've been cut back some – pacing is such a problem for Raimi and enough already with on again/off again relationship with MJ & Parker.In addition, we get the multiple 'Should I be a 'superhero' or not' long scenes. Superman did that, but only briefly in another superhero part 2: 'Superman II.' That's old and wears heavily. Thankfully, they move past it and you can enjoy the movie. Of course, if you can get past now multiple people knowing Spidey's true identity, that is.I cringe that the movie critic I respect the most (Roger Ebert,) called this the best superhero movie he's ever seen. I wouldn't go that far (I'll always be partial to 'Superman: The Movie.' Heck, a few years later 'The Dark Knight' blew this one away) but I would say it's absolutely recommended. Especially since we didn't have to wait too long to see Spider-Man swing, unlike part one.",9,18,26,15 November 2009
The Irishman," Got 3½ Hours to Kill?
","Nice to see the old gang back. Now, retire.Like war movies, I view highly acclaimed/recommended gangster films once and though I usually like them, I never want to see them again. I saw Saving Private Ryan once and thought: That was good, but I never want to see it again. (Same with Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now.) Also fits with The Godfather Parts I and II - saw those as a teenager and for my remaining 30 years, I have no interest in revisiting them.When it comes to this gang of misfit besties, I've seen Goodfellas once (again, I liked it and shelved it for the rest of my days) and Casino. In that latter film's case, I've actually seen that many times since, well, I love Sin City and believe what they told me - mostly in narration - to be true. Since I'm not a gangster-film lover, but casinos are by bag, Scorsese's Casino remains as my favorite gangster/mob film and I've bought it when available on multiple formats and will watch it a few more times before I pass.The Irishman has been recommended to me from at least 6 people. Not sure why. Despite all I told you above, this movie is JUST okay. Take away the painful...regrettable 209 minutes (or 3½ hour runtime,) it was slow as hell and I would've really dug a 2-hour cut of this.Don't get me wrong. The direction at times is fantastic. It was Scorsese at his finest. But, only at times. And the acting, wonderful. Aside from Pacino, I 100% felt these characters were genuine. And the cinematography and special effects of aging/de-aging these actors was top notch.But, after a while, it felt all so drawn out, I counted the minutes and played games on my phone as it droned on only stopping to read when some people got knocked off. Not only were the years 1979-1981 bad for mobsters, I would've preferred to see those stories.I guess the entire three and a half film can be summed up with: A nobody stumbles into the Mob's grace and eventually becomes besties with Jimmy Hoffa only to have to make a tough, loyalty decision years later.The first hour is fast paced, wonderfully directed/shot and gets me involved. Not to mention it reminded me of Scorsese/De Niro/Pesci's golden years in the 80s/90s. Unfortunately, Hour 2 slows down a bit, Hour 3 drags and during the last half hour, I counted the seconds.Funny, the biggest thing on my mind was the controversy over Anna Paquin's minimal lines. That kept me going and what to look for in the last third. It did NOT live up to the hype.And neither did the movie. For me, anyways.If you LOVE gangster/mob tales, especially with De Niro, Pesci and Scorsese on board, oh, I'm sure you'll love this reunion. It was interesting, I'll admit, for I didn't know that much about Hoffa. But, as I stated above: will I ever want to see this again?Hell, no.***Final thoughts: Try not to start your film at the end of someone's life. I know that's Scorsese's M.O. Both Goodfellas and Casino tell you who lives throughout the feature in the opening act. Same here. So...where's the tension with your main characters? But, who am *I* to tell the Avenger-hater how to craft a movie?",4,6,13,30 December 2019
127 Hours," Thank God it Wasn't Even 127 Minutes
","Director Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire, 28 Days Later, Trainspotting) is an established and brilliant film-maker and knows this very-hard subject matter did, in fact, needed to be a short film – 94 minutes.What this guy, Aron Ralston (played beautifully by James Franco in, by far, his best performance) had to go through for just over five days (go ahead: divide 127 hours by 24) was just torture and I'm just talking about the much-talked about exit strategy. Mercifully, since we really know what's to come before our butt hits the comfortable seat – I'm sure he'd give his right arm to sit down during those 5 days – ouch, sorry – its good we don't have to endure much more than an hour and a half.That's not to take away from his pain. But, quite literally, the events that took place, the background and surroundings, didn't really need much more time. Boyle did just fine with what took place.Simply speaking, avid and arrogant outdoorsman Aron treks alone in the Utah canyons after meeting two out-of-nowhere pretty girls. They invite him to a Scooby of a party that night after he shows them a 'wet' time. I'm guessing this might have inflated his ego even more, if possible, and he takes an ill-fated risk causing a bolder to lodge between a canyon wall and his poor right arm.Unfortunately for him, no one's within shouting distance and all first attempts at freeing himself are futile. What follows (for what we know are hours, then days) are his textbook emotions – SEE: Open Water. And that's not discounting what he went through, nor is it saying any of its fake on what occurred during his imprisonment. For, unlike The Perfect Storm, Aron video tapes himself down there.Yeah, it's a true story, and I concur he's more of an survivalist than me, but I'd give up one whole paycheck for the batteries he was buyingnothing I own would last as long as his did on battery juice.I digress. Again, Franco did a fantastic job – pretty much, aside from (potential hallucinations) or flashbacks, he's running the one-man show.Comparatively speaking, the same year produced Buried, another one-man extravaganza about a man trapped in a coffin. Between the two, putting the 'trueness' of this one aside, I'd pick 127 Hours even without the gruesome ending and self-mutilation he had to endure/cause.Aside from the great cinematography, the quick length and the performance worthy of an Oscar Nod (only) I will say I admire Boyle not turning this into a 'Hero' type of feel-good movie. The man, Aron, did nothing heroic, he put himself selfishly and incautiously in harm's way and he did what needed to be done to get free. He didn't jump on a speeding train (Unstoppable) to save the children! Or trek to NYC (The Day After Tomorrow) to save freezing children! Or, you get the picture. He fell making a mistake after making a mistake of not telling anyone where he was at. So, he made mistakes, paid dearly and now we get an instructional video of what not to do.The movie's nominated for best picture. Sure, it was good, very well made, even though I did NOT care for the music choices very much. Should it win? Absolutely not. Should it be viewed: hell yes.",8,0,2,30 January 2011
Spice World," We're Sorry, World
","Not sure why they included the word 'World' in their Spice World title when the girls occupy just two countries in this movie. Wait, backing up, why the hell would anyone think this was a good idea?It's hard to pinpoint the most ridiculous and awful part of this over-complicated, and yet, plot less film. Was it the aliens that the girls could understand because of the subtitles? Was it the doctor on holiday when a baby just appears after birth? Was it the toilet photographer? Was it the Dr Who bus? Was it the Rocky theme for a half a dozen steps? Was it the neglecting-the-pregnant-friend morning scene so they could train sing at fruity boot camp? Was it Bond's sad turn as Blofeld? Was it the dozens of called in favors from the guest appearances? Was it the girls breaking the fourth wall in the end credits and, incredibly, believing there were more than one person in the audience? Was it the two teen fans that looked even less interested in spending time with the Spice Girls than anyone watching this even when they're playfully thrown from a random boat?My excuse for watching this terrible plea to buy their CDs was that I listen to the How Did This Get Made podcast and it's all-but pointless listening to that hilarious podcast if you haven't seen the movie they make fun of on their show. I cannot wait to hear what they have to say about this. (I actually have a good idea as I watched this film.)Basically we have five girlfriend singers who are stalked by an amateur documentary maker, sabotaged by a tabloid editor, yelled at by their manager, fantasized by the movie-within-the-movie director/writer and made to feel guilty by a random, yet never explained, pregnant friend. Mercifully – not really, but I do try to be positive at times – the girls keep on rocking and remain BFFs for-eve-r!How on Earth did this make From Justin to Kelly look comprehensible?My guess, this movie began the downfall of the group and even if you're a die-hard fan to the end, spare yourself from this dreadful pile of donkey's discharge.* * * Final thoughts: Admittedly, I actually attended a Spice Girls concert once, back in the 1990s. Personally, I only liked 2-3 of their songs (still do,) but not enough to see them in concert. But, for a friend who absolutely loved them, I bought two tickets for us to go since he was feeling down. For whatever reason, he couldn't go and he sent me with his boyfriend who also liked them. It was literally one of the most painful experiences I've hadthat is, up until I saw this movie. After showing up a ton late, the girls played a dozen or so songs I'd never heard of, nor liked, and took – no kidding, 4-5 15-minute intermissions in between every 2-3 songs. It wasn't bad enough I didn't really want to be there in the first place, I was barely friends with the boyfriend replacement and I didn't care for their music as a whole, but they stretched it out as long as possible with far too many breaks.And still, I would rather go back to that concert than watch this again.",1,6,11,12 April 2014
"I Love You, Man"," Man-Dates are the best
","I loved 'I Love You Man'! Finally, a completely open and honest 'bromance' comedy shattering stereotypes, phobias and fake people. These are real people in real situations. Yes, there are men out there who seek out other male companionship without the fear of homosexuality entering the conversation. Sure, the movie has some homosexuals and their 'flare' but the overall message is acceptance, by not even talking about it. And forget the signature and overly clichéd jealousy and is he/is he not gay story lines. As much as I loved the script, the originality of it, the music, the freedom of the cast, the humor, romance, pacing, and the great cast including Jones, Segel and Lennon (who I barely recognized – from the great 'Reno 911!'), I mostly loved Rudd, giving his best performance yet. Sure, he's been great in a lot of movies, and clearly one of my all time favorites, but here, he truly showed true acting; I truly believed who he was. The plot consists of groom-to-be without-a-best-man who, in order to find that best man must finally connect with another male after a life consisting of only females. He's so into the woman's world, he's lost touch with his masculine side and doesn't know how to act around other males, or how males are supposed to act. Enter in a lot of 'butch' talk from Rudd when he befriends Segel. I use this a lot as a joke to my straight-counterparts, but Rudd pulls it off with such sincerity. Sure, the movie's predictable, as you know what's going to happen and when. But Rudd, Segel, Jones and the absolutely hilarious Favreau (in his most unique and original role he's played, much like Rudd) pull out such a hit, you really feel for these characters. An absolute must-see.",9,1,3,10 August 2009
Batman Returns," Hell Here
","Batman's a murderer. There's no getting around that. He literally killed someone. And Batmanjustdoesnotdothat.I'm revisiting some of my favorite 90s movies for a special series, and to be honest, I was thoroughly looking forward to this (unknown number)th viewing of Batman Returns. It's a real 'summer' release, it contains Selina Kyle – an awesome Catwoman and the original and still best Batman – Michael Keaton along with the wonderful Tim Burton. So why would I only rate it 5/10 stars?Well, the story sucks. Really it does. Where the cinematography is awesome – PURE Burton – as is PURE Pfeiffer as Catwoman, the movie sags with the broken story. And it was the start of the original Batman franchise: More is more. Let's add more characters! That'll spruce it up. (Not really, but they thought so, all the way to Batman & Robin) Let's offer a suggestion: Pitch the Penguin (DeVito.) Keep but tone down Shreck (Walken.) And re-write the finale.Of the original four Batman movies, two directed by Tim Burton, two by Schumacher, this one is the one that's a direct sequel, whereas they flat-out mention events/characters from the previous installment. It's some time since the events where Joker (Nicholson) died in #1, and Batman's been waiting and now respected by (the now elusive) Commissioner Gordon (Hingle.) A new gang's in town, led by the Penguin who has an agenda.The Penguin's kinda, sorta controlled by Millionaire Max Screck who both wants to promote Penguin to Mayor and has a somewhat dead, but devious nonetheless, secretary Selina Kyle who becomes Catwoman when she falls to the felines around her and then she falls further for Batman and/or Bruce Wayne, who's struggling dual identities, still sinceMy head is spinning, and that's thanks to screenplay writer Daniel Waters. There's more and that's just too much. And that's, well, too much in a movie that could've been a contender. It's a beautifully shot film, despite being a cross between typical Burton and Rob Zombie's House of 1000 Corpses oddly enough.The movie starts off promising. It has that summer movie feel, regardless of the 'Christmas' theme, in addition to a bloody fun Comic-Book movie feel, but surely sinks into over-plot'ness with too many angles. So many, that no wonder both Burton and Keaton refused part III. And it ends on such an outrageous finale, things that Batman would not surely do, that you wonder if they had an inkling of how to end the movie.And does everyone bypass the fact that Batman actually killed someone? Intentionally?! Spoiler alert or not, Batman attaches a bomb to a bad clown figure and pushes him down a shaft where he explodes. Not a thought goes into this scene, nor repercussions. Surely, Christopher Nolan would've explore Batman being hunted for murder.This all said, I still do rank it upwards to five out of 10 stars for the fantastic score – possibly the best score of all (so far) six movies, the best song – Face to Face by Siouxsie and the Banshees, the best baddie: Pfeiffer's Catwoman was simply delicious and one of her all-time best roles and the overall look of the sets and cinematography was superb.Despite all that's wrong with the picture, it's worth a shot for some good lines, Pfeiffer and Burton's vision. Get past the spotty story and the fact Batman would NEVER kill someone, and you have the only worthwhile sequel to the classic and original Batman.",5,0,2,5 August 2010
Blade," Slice Blade
","'Blade' would be an extremely above-average comic-book, vampire-hunter action/horror if it weren't for two minor flaws. #1 I loved seeing the all-but invincible Blade/Snipes do his slicing and dicing, but the whole 'Yes!' fist/punch was literally a letdown. #2 Bad, no make that horrible, CGI – even for 1998 standards. This is mainly in the last third, but some sprinkled throughout. Okay, despite those minor infractions, I really enjoyed this movie. All actors did a suburb job and the fact that this now looks like yet another 'Matrix' rip-off is hilarious considering this came out one year prior. So maybe 'The Matrix' copied 'Blade.' At any rate, it's a very movie for multiple genre-loving audiences: Comic Book geeks, action fanatics and horror/vampire lovers. So, we have Blade, half-man/half-vampire, or 'day-walker' and his accomplish, Whisler (a la 'Batman and Alfred') battling the undead who, apparently almost out number humans. Who knew? In a rare act of humanity (Blade's more of an antihero) our sword ninja/vamp rescues a newly infected (coincidentally) blood specialist/doctor. Meanwhile, trouble brews amongst the vampires as one wants (you guessed it) supreme power and needs Blade somehow to obtain it. It's not the most original concept, if you read what I just wrote, but still highly enjoyable. You will want to see Blade succeed, you will root for him despite his imperfections and mannerisms. And you will know what's coming as this is the typical act 1-2-3 of a comic book introduction movie. Still, watch this without trying to go too deep. Such as Vampire SPF-1000 'suntan lotion'? Really? What about the scalp? Wouldn't that still burn? Just like the money they burn for weapons? Uh, okay, I am going too deep. Once again, sit back and enjoy the techno-charged fun ride.",7,1,18,2 November 2009
Superbad," I'm Assuming the 'Bad' means 'Good'
","You know these kinds of movies. The ones that grow on you. You can watch the entire thing through and mildly like it, but for hours, if not days, following, you find yourself laughing and/or enjoying the product you experienced.Superbad has now done that to me twice. Well, I've seen it now twice, and both times I kept finding it 'just okay' or 'barely funny' throughout, yet following and especially in discussion with a work buddy the next day, I found my laughing out loud at some of the lines and humorous (supposedly) irrelevant scenes.I also thought of how innocently they re-created high school, much like the John Hughes comedies of decades past. Aside from the goofy, but hilarious cops, everything pretty much played out as if this was based on true events. (Was it, Seth?)BFFs Seth (Hill) & Evan (Cera) venture through their last weeks of high school slacking, complaining and upset they can't continue their lifelong friendship into college as they're headed to different schools. While wooing their prospective mates, the inexperienced duos plan to hit up a party one night and they're set to purchase and bring the booze. Only they're underage.In comes Fogell (Mintz-Plasse in his introduction role thatwillseriouslydefine him from here on out) who got a fake ID with the one name (Cher, anyone?) McLovin on it and that he's Hawaiian. I'm guessing this was California, but most license plates (and police uniforms) state 'Clark County' – which, of course, could be just about anywhere.At any rate, they go through hell & high water to get the tainted water and to the girls of their dreams while realizing they're losing more than they're gaining.If these were adults, it would be hard not to relish the many events, close calls and fun times they actually had. Meaning, they act like this will happen every day of their life outside of high school. It could, but it's 99% doubtful. Perhaps if these characters were real, they could, in fact, look back and cherish the absolute fun they had, if not just on this night.There's a ton of swearing and some sexuality towards the end – I did say this was realistic, so its crucial to the plot and actually separates this from those Hughes movies. It's also surprisenly touching, and I'm not referring to the bromantic 'drunk/love' scene towards the closing. It's on the escalatorthe look Seth gives is so real and heartbreaking, it almost makes the whole movie, if you haven't already yet appreciated the humor – namely from (once again) the brilliant Michael Cera.It's not overloaded like the other Johan Hill/Seth Rogan movies with cameos, though there are a few. I couldn't believe my eyes when Clark Duke is spotted in the party with barely a line to his character. And speaking of Rogan (as Officer Michaels,) as funny he was as the rookie cop along with Officer Slater (Hader) as the drunk veteran, I thought they actually brought the movie down a slight notch. Sure, they were both hilarious – namely with the liquor store clerk, but they are the absolute only unrealistic part of the movie.That said, it's a real thinker. I've been told by more than one person – and as stated, this is my opinion as well, that this movie isn't great the first time. But it sure as heck grows on you the more you think about it. That's good writing.Side Note: after recently watching Easy A, a movie I fell in love with Emma Stone, it was great to watch her here. I sincerely hope she goes far in her career.",8,2,4,16 January 2011
Creed," Unnecessary Creedence Revival
","This HAS to be the year of nostalgia with the Original Star Wars trilogy remake, the Return to Jurassic Park Reboot and the memory of 1960's Bond in Spectre. But, the one I never asked for, nor anyone really needed, was to see Rocky XXXVIII.Butsince so many people kept asking my opinion on it and how many rave reviews I've heard that might equate Oscar buzz, I decided to check it out. I am sorry I did.Not that the movie's ineptly made, it's just an incredible retread of countless boxing movies before it. Hell, it even played homage to all the previous Rocky training montages before itand repeatedly. Over and over. Half way through I was ready to give up with the extreme number of clichés and unoriginal ideas/paths, but figured the second half HAS to be better since so many people loved it so much.Nope. The second half was just as dull and the same old story. In fact, once the climax hit – the obligatory finale in any of these boxing movies – I had completely tuned out. Not only did I know how it would pan out, I didn't care one bit.This movie had one singular fresh idea (son of former boxing champ in the Rocky series, Apollo Creed, is introduced) but every single other minute was unoriginal and predictable from six scenes leading up. It was so by the numbers, it's a wonder anyone even cared to even mention the movie to me. I wish someone would tell me how this movie is so great and stands out from every other boxing film. Okay, the lead, Michael B. Jordan was decent, but he was just playing his role in this 'should've been made-for-Lifetime-TV movie.' Sylvester Stallone has reinvented himself many, many years ago, as an aging action star, and now he's completely beyond that. It's getting old and perhaps it's time, SlyI guess if you're heavily into boxing, boxing movies AND just want to see the exact same movie you've seen countless times before, you might like it. Otherwise, it's an extreme waste of more than two hours.",2,81,158,20 December 2015
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Wolverine Rising
","Watching Hugh Jackman play Wolverine again is like watching Anthony Hopkins play Hannibal again; no matter how bad the movie is, it's still great to watch them play their iconic, and #1 career roles. 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' unfortunately starts off slow, and despite some good action sequences, really never picks up. The major problem with prequels is you already know what's going to happen, and in 'Wolverine' you hear him say I'm going to kill Sabretooth and Stryker probably a dozen times. Well, unless they're asking us to forget the original 'X-Men' films, it's kinda like someone saying in Star Wars 1-3: 'I'm going to kill Anakin' or someone actually attempting the murder of the Anti-Christ in 'Left Behind.' And speaking of the original movies, didn't they already give the origins of Wolverine throughout all three films? At very least you learned a lot more about Hannibal Lector in 'Hannibal Rising,' though an equally bad film. In this one, you learn he's about 150 or more years old, he once was in love and his original claws were made of bone, which, by the way was hard to watch – I wanted to see the steel ones throughout. That's about all the extras you'll get as you watch him grow & fight with or against his brother, Sabretooth, from the mid-1800s to present. And as mentioned, though some of the action sequences were well shot, a lot of the CGI, or effects were almost downright laughable. As was the unoriginal dialogue, the extremely predictable 'mystery' (and I'm not referring to the fact it's a prequel; solving what this movie presents takes the mind of a four-year-old) and unnecessary and unoriginal origin story that's already been told. One word of advice, despite the 'shocking surprise' after the credits, it's NOT WORTH IT.",2,33,69,3 May 2009
Hot Fuzz," Angel Has Risen
","I've seen this movie only once before, LONG, LONG ago and weirdly, my memory on it is wildly fuzzy.I mean, what I recall are the events leading up to our hero cop from London finally relaxing in the pub and loosening up a bit. But, that's like 30 minutes in, and we still have 90 more minutes to go! And that's my biggest problem with this movie. How incredibly long it is for a 'comedy.'But, that's the catch...22. I really would NOT consider this a comedy. This is 100% a mystery-action FIRST and comedy third. Now, don't get me wrong; this movie is hilarious. MANY times did I LAUGH OUT LOUD at its brilliant humor, but for the most part, it's a mystery with just a tad more action than humor. Like half a percent.London's got a Supercop. No, not the Jackie Chan one actually referenced here. They have an overzealous, smart, by the book OFFICER who's making everyone else in the Capital look bad. So, they ship him to a small, crimeless country town and when unique and horrific 'accidents' begin to happen, 'Hot Fuzz,' himself, is on the case.I will praise myself a bit. Once I started to try and think of this more of a mystery than comedy, I pegged the bad guy(s.) And I was right! So, way to go, Steve! Despite how many movies I see, I'm usually terrible at guessing the murder-mystery villains. Ok, that all said...I was only partially right.Helps my memory on this was 90% wiped. And that's a good feeling. I love forgetting great movies and rediscovering them a decade or more later. It's like getting the same feeling all over again.They call this movie part of a trilogy despite none of the same characters appear in any of the three films: Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and The World's End. While I totally dug this movie, I would absolutely rank these three films in the exact order of the supposed trilogy.This movie, again, was unquestionably hilarious and I loved the mystery and plight of Simon Pegg's character, alongside non-sexual partner Nick Frost. But, given the chance to see this again or Shaun of the Dead, I would 100% make it a double feature night!Much like 1991's Point Break and Bad Boys II.***Final thoughts: Speaking of which - while not a huge fan of Bad Boys 1, I thought it was just OK having just seen it for the first and ONLY time on 2/26/12. (Can't believe it's been that long!) Since this movie referenced the sequel and long-delayed Part III is scheduled to come out soon, perhaps I need to finally see that for the first time.Final Thoughts II: Speaking of Sequels - while Nick Frost wasn't wildly out of character or really anything in this film but a great friend and emotional misdirect in the finale (I really did tear up a bit!!!,) it was so odd seeing Pegg as the Straight Man. That took SUCH a long time to peg Simon as the 'normal' one. It's like seeing James Bond as a Supermarket Owner.This film was no holds barred! As they said. For the greater good.",8,0,1,6 January 2020
The Mummy," Raiders of the Mummy's Tomb
","It's not easy to separate the adventures of the blandly named 'Rick' and the true movie adventurer Indiana Jones, but since Indy hadn't an excellent adventure since 1989 (and probably never will again,) this will do.The Mummy was actually a really fun ride. And that's all it is. Don't look for depth, for any amount of seriousness or even memorable characters – aside from the mostly absent title character, that is. Despite my first paragraph, it's best to avoid thinking of the superior Dr. Jones serials and just have fun. And, sure, it's silly – sometimes overly inane and the movie was way too convoluted; SEE: the opening novel-sized narration shots to set-up the background story. Oh, and some of the special effects not only don't hold up today, but were questionable back in 1999.AGAIN it's just a thrill adventure that requires you to leave your brain at the door. For, it has all the elements of old westerns, romantic slapstick of decades past and the horror elements of the original Mummy films of the 1930s.Adventurer Rick stumbles upon the city of the dead and years following, is taken in by a librarian and her brother to retrieve old books and other artifacts. None of them truly believe the old Egyptian myths of the undead being able to be resurrected and, of course, that's what's about to happen.'The Mummy,' or High Priest Imhotep, does come back (eeeeventually – it really does take the movie a long time to (re)introduce the title character) and besides completely restoring his body to flesh and inadvertently causing Biblical plagues, his main mission is to also bring back his lovely adulteress.Reluctantly, Rick and the Gang vow to stop him because of some 'legend' that hell would be on Earth. Actually, I think that was just to cause more tension in the film because other than words, that didn't seem like it would happen.Nevertheless, park your brain, let loose, laugh a lot, avoid the normal criticism people like me would normally write about and you'll have a good time. Rick is absolutely no Indy and the movie is certainly no Raiders, but since there were only two (out of four) solid Indiana Jones flicks, this is a good companion piece.",7,0,2,13 May 2013
Rise of the Guardians," Rise to the Occasions
","Who would dispute that Rise of the Guardians is a gorgeously made animated film, with some awesome characters, fun, adventure and some heart? If so, then you don't believe and you're part of the(ir) problem.I kid. And, in reality, I didn't want to see this. The trailers didn't interest me, the idea of the 'guardians' didn't strike me as original and I really got animated out the last couple of years. BoyI was wrong.Now, it certainly had its downsides – Santa, er, 'North' – was really a (omitted, because, well, uh, this is a children's movie) at times, and probably landed on my bottom five of all Santa's I've seen in movies. (The Easter Bunny was no spring picnic, himself, either.) The heart was there, but it was overshadowed by the adventure and graphics, which, again, were spectacular, but the story always needs to shine above cinematography. And I wanted to like the main star, Jack Frost, more, but he certainly went through the same ole motions of 'that reluctant hero' until the very end.That all said – and I wanted to get that out of the way, I really had a great time during this and did laugh a lot – especially with the elves and Sandy. Will it be an endless animated holiday classic? (Which one, you ask? Eh, pick one.) Don't think so. I certainly believe The Nightmare Before Christmas and The Polar Express trumps this movie, but that doesn't mean it stands alone away from the holidays as a highly exciting adventure.When the movie begins, we see the origins of Jack Frost and how good he is. I immediately got into his story, because, somehow, I thought he was going to be the villain. I think The Santa Clause 3 warped my fragile little mind on that character. But, alas, after fast-forwarding 300 years, he's still a good and 'just wanna have fun' kind of guy. He plays the 'where's my place' card and is summoned to join 'The Guardians' – a band of childhood fantasy characters whose job is less protection of children as they claim and more focused on making sure children still believe in them. I think Freddy Krueger has played this card more than onceMeanwhile, and the reason of Jack's calling, we have the deliciously fun Pitch, who has the hardest time trying to distinguish himself from Hades of Disney's Hercules from those who grew up on the pre-Pixar animated Disney fare. He's bent on instilling fear into children – oh, he's the Boogeyman, by the way – and casting doubt on the Guardians.He's a pretty decent villain with some great truths – my kind of cinema bad guy. Despite his charisma, will confused Jack join him, or stick with the Guardians to bring joy to all the children who believe? I repeat: this is a children's movie. So draw your own conclusion.2012's animated films had their highs and way lows. Rise of the Guardians is certainly in the top portion, and I am sorry I didn't see it in theatres. But, then again, I get burnt out on how many there are and usually suckered into the bottom portion cartoons.This is a must-see, and if possible, on BluRay. It's absolutely stunning.",8,0,0,7 April 2013
Dead Poets Society," Seize the Phrase
","Funny thing about this movie: I just think it's okay. It hits all the beats, the clichés, the heartstrings... but to me, it's just going through the motions to get through it.No complaints and Williams did a fine job. Actually, all the actors did. If you liked this movie about finding your inner voice among conforming rules in a boarding school, so be it.That's it. That's all I have to say. I only saw this once before, probably 25-28 years ago and felt the same back then. I added to the list now hoping it would inspire me, or I'd see it in a new light and rejoice!Nope. I'm still: eh. Okay, seize the day - don't conform!I'm way past that in my own life. I guess I have other past progressive people/teachers to thank for that. So. Thanks!",5,0,0,14 April 2019
Just Go with It," Any Script Will Sandler Go With
","Fine. I didn't hate 'Just Go With It' (3/10 Stars), I just didn't laugh. That much. I'll admit there's a few lines, as in 3, in TWO (too long) hours that I chuckled at. But sadly, this plot which was old enough to make the Bible look fresh, was so painfully obvious from the first 5 minutes, they didn't even hide the 'spoiler' from the poster itself. They had THAT much faith in their project that they said, 'Okay, we know you're not all that stupid, despite the fact you chose an Adam Sandler film for entertainment, so why don't we just get it all over with the poster.' The movie was painful at times – Sandler playing his typical RICH Doofus only he went beyond slapstickish as being the worst doctor in movie history – but it was just a ruse to get the two real loves together. Obviously. Look, I would've appreciated it tenfold if the unpredicted wedding took place in the finale instead of what we all know what's coming. Oh, and lest we forget, despite Dr. Sandler having unfunny pokes with his assistant at patients, he's also an ass who uses, abuses and LIES to women for 20 years. Why, again, are we supposed to root for this guy? Even Jennifer Aniston knows this about him oh, wait, she's had experience in that field",3,3,7,29 January 2012
Brokeback Mountain," Brokeback Masterpiece
","Brokeback Mountain *****/5 stars 10/21/09This review of 'Brokeback Mountain' is long overdue. I first saw this in 2005, the night before it opened as a sneak-preview. I feel in love with it then, and now, and 4-5 viewings, I consider it a masterpiece. And I do so, from personal experience. I can certainly relate to what the main characters are going through, and watching their facial expressions, eyes and motions; they are truly real. I've gone through what they did (for the most part.) What society teaches us, at a very young age, is: grow, get married, have offspring. There is no room for people that think outside the box. And so these two lead cowboys did just that. Sad. Tragedy ensured, of course. They were the square pegs in round holes that tried what society taught them and they cheated to their one true love: each other. If there were no other evidence, there's the Academy Awards that ignored this masterpiece due to homophobia. Tragic that they missed out on a perfect film in all categories: music, score, beautiful cinematography, acting, script/dialogue, originality. I mean, this movie worked on every level. But, what I focused in on was, very simply, these two heterosexual actors showing true love for each other on screen. I truly believed that from the get-go. I would've rated the movie the same if it were cowboy and girl, as long as they led me to believe in their need of each other. Two cowboys meet and fall in love, but (as previously mentioned) society taught them the breeder way and they part company only to meet up several times a year for 20 years. Trust me, for people that object to this kind of love, you see this as black/white but the heart bleeds/cries when it can't be whole.Side Note: I hope this movie serves as a message for young viewers (of age to see it, that is): Please don't waste your time, 20 years in this film's timeline, listening to others. If you find true love like this and even if it only lasts but a moment, cherish it. Nurture it. I don't condone adultery. So don't let it get to that. I felt for the women (well, not so much for Hathaway character – she was married for convenience) and I would dump someone cheating on me. Know who you are before getting into a committed relationship. Definitively know who and what you are prior to having children. Too many of my gay friends had children and they, their ex's and absolutely the children, pay for the inevitable break up when they finally realized who they were. Spend time finding yourself before diving right into a so-called committed relationship.Side Note 2: I am sad this movie fell amongst the curse of a lot of movies. It's great, excellent even, until it gets too much press. I loved (and still do) 'Titanic' and 'The Blair Witch Project.' I saw them both opening weekends. My opinion never changed as the weeks/months/years passed. I know what I like or what makes a great film. No public opinion will change that. But the curse is, the more exposure a film gets, the more criticism it gets, i.e. 'Oh, I heard it was the best ever! But it sucked!' You should judge on the qualities, not what your neighbor says.Side Note 3: I was still recently very bitter on the good (but not great) 'Crash' winning the best picture Oscar. I liked 'Crash.' But it was highly unoriginal (even for its time) and 10x less of the movie 'Brokeback' is. Years later, it was reported that the main reason 'Brokeback' lost, was due to the fact that more than half of the Academy voters refused to watch the movie based on the homosexual content. If I hated them before, this was the final nail in the coffin. Each year, I watch all 5 movies (soon to be 10) that are nominated before making my own conclusion of the choices given. If I am unable to do so, I will not make my pick. This is blasphemy, bigotry and phobia at its worst. Though I am saddened, ashamed and disgusted at their inactivity, I finally came to believe that one of the most honored films in history (from all the other awards it won,) it doesn't matter. We'll always have homophobia, as we do racists. Does it make this film any less perfect? No. If anything, it makes me want to find my own soul mate, my own 'Brokeback Mountain' and disown the select bigots that inhabit society.",10,12,13,21 October 2009
Orphan," Child's Play-time is Over
","This movie came out 10 years ago, but was a decade late even then.Wow, for such an overlong film, the movie was so uneven, badly edited, predictable and never paid off in its many, many ideas and characters. And not to mention, this had fantastic actors doing their worst acting jobs.A rich family of four decide on a fifth after a stillborn member never entered their life. So, adoption it is! What a bad idea that was. Okay, normally, it's not, but this is was one bad seed.Sadly, a podcast I adore and listen to regularly spoiled this movie's main twist. (SHAME ON YOU, SHOCKWAVES.) Now, that was many episodes ago and since I hadn't seen this, I wasn't 100% sure this was the movie they spoiled. Once I did finish it, yeah, they spoiled the hell out of it. (Again, SHAME ON YOU, SHOCKWAVES.)So, I was expecting that twist, though I was hoping a little more went along with the spoiler. Nope. Nothing was added to it. Now, of course, I won't reveal the ending, and you might not see it coming. If you do end up wanting to see this mess of a film, you might enjoy it because it's not really foretold. I'll give the movie kudos for that.But, I won't budge on my feelings on how uneven and unnecessarily long it all was. Additionally, the actions of some characters are so painfully obvious and the inaction of others, so unrealistic. I never stopped disbelieving most of this movie and always hated all the bad edit cuts.I'm not 100% disappointed, however. The house and treehouse sets were pretty good looking, I loved the constant snow (but then, I love winter) and the title character's acting was pretty good for her age.Okay, it's slightly recommended for the locations, Lil Orphan's acting and people who want 1990s horror movie nostalgia, albeit 10 years too late. But, barely. Adopt this at your own risk.***Final thoughts: To be fair, while the podcast, Shockwaves, is pretty detailed - though sometimes TOO DETAILED - on their descriptions of horror films, they rarely completely spoil a movie like this. They get damn close at times, but never this blunt. I was so hoping throughout this experience I was wrong on their spoiler and this never-seen-by-me film, but it was ALWAYS in the front of my mind. So, one final time: SHAME ON YOU, SHOCKWAVES.",3,1,2,7 March 2019
Spotlight," Shine it!
","Wow, just took me to January 1st, 2016 to see my only 10 star film of 2015.This movie is amazing and captivating from the first frame. I was literally that hooked from the second the movie opened. I wanted to know more, see more, learn more. The cast was incredible, believable, real and had wonderful chemistry. In fact, not one moment passed when I didn't feel like I was a part of this real story and sitting alongside all of them. I could go on and on, and will. The story was fascinating, motivating, deep and intriguing. These warriors, these journalists, weren't just doing their job, they 100% believed in it and wanted to correct their own mistakes as well as the countless other demons within the catholic church.This story needed to be told back in the early 2000s, as it does need revisiting now. I know the catholic church truly wanted to sweep this under the rug once (or make that for DECADES,) but they also wanted their poor decisions, to put it mildly, to be forgotten in the years following. It shouldn't. Their horrendous crimes and cover-ups should never be removed from our memory. Forever, the church should be remembered for their terrible sins.Guess it helps I'm not catholic. And I might be getting a little emotional. The movie, about the Boston Globe's small Spotlight investigation team unraveling decades of deceit within the catholic church in which they were hiding/relocating pedophiles, was so great and wonderfully simple on so many levels. From acting to direction to pacingthat alone usually irks me, but not once in the over two hour runtime was I not on the edge of my seat. That says a lot about a movie that has no action or high Hollywood dramatic scenes. (Well, there was one speech by the fantastic Mark Ruffalo and I envisioned that scene being shown at the Oscars for his inevitable nomination, but it didn't feel fake or forced.)From a cinema lover's viewpoint, this should be seen on how much they got right. From the normal audience's POV, it should be seen to remind us: if the big entity (the church) did it once, watch for it again, if not currently. And from the victim's corner, they should cherish these heroes as the surviving Holocaust members and family viewed Schindler's List. * * *Final thoughts: On a personal level, it helps I love actual newspaper/investigating movies. Another one of my favorites also starred the brilliant Michael Keaton: The Paper. I already miss these days when real journalism happened not just 98% of the internet crap. So, that all said, this movie might be slow to most people (hell, they showed the extent of the 'inter-net' back in 2001 with a full billboard in the Boston Globe's own parking lot for AOL) but to me, to see real people doing real journalism was and always will be fascinating to me.",10,7,12,1 January 2016
Terminator Salvation," The only Salvation would've been them ending at 'T2.'
","I gave Christian Bale credit for bringing the true 'Batman voice/bark' to Batman in 'The Dark Knight,' despite the general public's ignorance on the true Batman and how he communicated. Unfortunately, against my argument, he uses it again in 'Terminator: Salvation' and this time, it really didn't fit.Aside from that, we have just a money-grabbing sequel that basically just showed 'Judgment Day' combat scenes and was completely unnecessary. Yes, it has bangs, some good action sequences and yet another great Asian female kicking butt. But, what's gone is: the heart, the character development, the suspense, the acting and the good, sometimes funny dialogue from the first 2 films – the only ones that should count. 'T3' was a complete waste of space, so I don't count that one, and though this 'T4' is slightly better, it also shouldn't count. No wonder James Cameron didn't approve of this sequel.The series was as perfect as it could've been as well as a complete story with the original 'Terminator' and 'T2.' I seriously laughed out loud at the clichéd 'bad guy revealing the evil plot to the hero' towards the end, downgrading Skynet to a mere human and stereotyped villain. Also, I respect Carter, but she was equally as bad in her cancer role, and what was with the helicopter dive to the submarine? Seriously? I should've listened to myself with my promise not to see another 'Terminator' sequel after 'T3' – the same promise I made on this dismal 'Jurassic Park III.' Yet, I did like Worthington and Bloodgood's performances, but Bale was certainly not at his best, and that kid, Jadagrace practically made me crack up as a cross between 'Aliens' kid Newt, 'Day Earth Stood Still' kid Jacob and a mini-Sideshow Bob. What a completely unoriginal character, as were most stand-ins.And enough with the homage to the original films – every 20 minutes – which only made me want to watch them again VS this one again Most of it was extremely predictable and got zero reaction from the audience I was with. Not the worst movie, but a severe downgrade from 'T1 and 2.'",2,8,15,23 May 2009
Insomnia," The Greatest Anti-Sleeper Hit
","Though Insomnia wasn't Robin Williams's first trip to the dark side, nor was it Al Pacino's first cop drama, it was, in fact, their best performances in their respectable roles as such.I truly liked this movie a lot. It had elements of The Silence of the Lambs and the beauty of Alaska. No one could've played a sleep-deprived cop like Pacino. He already looks 80% asleep in most of his roles. Williams was superb as the incredibly un-clichéd antagonist. His character, writer Walter Finch, was smart, but not brilliant. He actually seemed like how normal people would react if they were, in fact, in his predicament. And Hilary Swank, well, she's been better in other movies, and she's no Marge Gunderson (played by Frances McDormand in Fargo.) Yet, she did what she could and was still entertaining.That all said, the real stars of the movie were the fantastic script and scenery. Gorgeous locales that make you walk in their sleepwalking shoes. Thanks to the screenplay and backdrops, you could feel every ounce of pain that the Detective Will Dormer (Pacino) was feeling. Now, knowing his background and if he's really a good person, that'll take you a bit.A young girl is killed in the town of no sundown in Alaska (this period of the year, that is) and L.A. Detectives Dormer and Eckhart (Donovan) are called up North to assist the wet-behind-the-ears Ellie Burr (Swank) in solving it. Ellie's ecstatic: Dormer's her hero; she's written papers on him and memorized some of his statements. She's also naïve, but not entirely stupid.Apparently both Dormer & Eckhart had left L.A. in the nick of time as they were being investigated by Internal Affairs for some 'wrong doing' in one of Dormer's cases. Up there, it's not necessarily smooth sailing as Dormer cannot sleep for more reasons than the sun won't go down. As they close in on the killer, mistakes are made, including a fatal one in which the real killer attaches onto.This movie is not perfect, but it's a definite homage to the suspenseful mysteries of the past. Only, this time, it's directed masterfully by one of the greatest directors of all time, Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight, Memento.) It does have powerful performances, crisp cinematography, daring dialogue and really human characters that make this one of the most believable cat 'n mouse films to watch.

Aquaman," Thor Underwater
","I know I'm probably causing waves here, but I clearly see why this made so much across the seas. It's just so basic.Awww, James Wan. How you've been bought out. I mean, good for you, as a director and creator, you've come so far...to earn so much. But, you've also left your soul behind in that dirty SAW basement to enter the depths of the oceans and sell out to DC.But, anyways, I didn't hate this movie. It was so much like Black Panther - just OK. So mediocre, so bland, so formulaic. There was nothing new here...aside from so many swear words that were just added in for 'depth.' The edge! Now, I'm no prude. I swear up and down, but here it felt forced.Anyways, we have reluctant Aquaman who's hell-bent on not being the King he's supposed to be that he journeys the entire movie to become said King. Oh, and insert sets, conflicts and villains A-B-C on his journey. And lest, I forget, his relationship with Not-Scarlett Johansson plays a part.So this Fish-Outta-Water-Film is the classic tale of self-discovery with a 1000% CGI. Though I am NOOOO CGI fan, I guess there's really little alternative here. We have The Little Mermaid made into a live-action battle, Ã  la The Phantom Menace.And now, back to knocking the lands across the ocean. They see 1 movie for every 100 I see, so yeah, I have a right to say this was bad overall, though still watchable. It's just not great as: let's earn a billion and become the greatest DCEU film. It's certainly not the best, but I can see where people connected with it.Just wish they would've explored the whole pollution thing a tad farther. Yeah, us humans suck and it's only briefly mentioned here. Stand up, stop polluting the oceans and it's sooo beyond those damn straws.***Final thoughts: Yep, this is the highest grossing worldwide DCEU movie, but far from the best one:1. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice Ultimate Edition
2. Man of Steel
3. Wonder Woman
4. Suicide Squad: Extended Cut
5. Aquaman
6. Justice League",4,4,6,20 January 2019
500 Days of Summer," 500 Days of Summer? That's Normal
","500 Days of Summer? Big deal, I live in Phoenix, AZ. We have 500 days of summer every year.Actually the little movie was a big deal. Currently, I am only awarding it 4/5 stars, however, I think this will be one that will grow on me. It's only been a short while since I've seen it, and I can't get it out of my mind.That being said, it did fell forced at times, the side characters were only mildly amusing (his friends were good – not great, but his sister was so clichéd that she was almost hard to watch) and you can tell the movie it was trying to mimic in the opening with the outlined city (and then throughout.) Okay, if you couldn't tell, watch/re-watch the brilliant Juno.In addition, I really want to say Gordon-Levitt did a great job and should be up for an Oscar nom. But, I can barely say he did a good job. He was trying to play a stuck-in-his-past (well, at all times) geek and though he got that down, no real depth or believability came from him. The movie really belonged solely to Deschanel.She was perfect on many levels. Stole every scene, showed growth and depth consistently and had a perfect on screen persona, a genuine charisma that grabbed you as you got to know her. She deserves, at very least, an Oscar nomination for her real-life character.Probably the majority of people go through relationships like Tom and Summer have. It's no spoiler that this relationship was doomed from day one (of 500 – obviously.) They tell you that less than a minute in. You want it to work out, you yearn for the nerd to get the free-bird (again, literally) girl. However, as previously mentioned, it was not meant to be and one of the most brilliant aspects was the revolution in the closing on why not.I know I've been through a relationship like this. One party believes in fate, that one special, soul-mate (that's me, duh) while the other's skeptical and may not be the true 'one.' It does hurt that both me and Tom share more than the years in an office job trait – we're both nerds stuck in the past.Nevertheless, back to the movie. We follow their relationship for 500 day, back and forth from day 42 to 303, then to 121. A lot of the comedy stems from these wonderful transitions. Such as, the fantastic dance segment to Tom's mood in another day of 500. (Side note: Spider-Man 3 did pretty much the same thing, following Peter Parker and in his mind a lovely stroll through the city and a vintage song playing. How did a movie that probably spent $500 million less get this kind of scene right?) Like I said before, some of this felt forced, including a Jerry Macguire blow up, but there were a lot of wonderful scenes, a lot of comedy that made me laugh out loud. It is an adult comedy, and even though most of the movie is pretty much 'clear' (and 'clean') of today's adult romcoms – i.e. any Paul Rudd/Seth Rogen/Adam Sandler features, it will remind you, you're not watching a PG-13 film.I definitely would recommend this small movie to mass audiences, if not just for Deschanel. It was refreshing to see an original spin on the romantic movies of current years. A movie that puts a lot of 1970-80s references to people my age (or Tom's and Summer's) without shoving it down our throats.",8,0,2,2 December 2009
Juno," Preggers Can't Be Choosers
","If I could only rate this movie 5/5 stars on the soundtrack alone, I would. But, not only would that be inconsiderate to all else that went into making Juno an instant classic, it would cause people to only go out and buy the album vs. watching such a fantastic film.Admittedly, I only saw this movie once, when trying to catch up on all the Best Picture nominees from 2007. I loved it, absolutely, but never got around to viewing it again until last night. AndI had previously purchased it on BluRay months ago!I loved it just as much now as I did back then. The writing, from soon-to-be mediocre Diablo Cody, was excellent for this project. The normal dialect from teens would normally turn me off – and would get worse as Facebook grew in popularity, but I absolutely adored it here. This is all due to the once in a lifetime, perfect performance by Ellen Page as the title character.She was so great, so real, so believable, she doesn't just carry the child, er, movie, she keeps us highly entertained even when a lot of other great filmmaking techniques and performances might go unnoticed from beginning to end.Best high school buds, Juno and Paulie (the always wonderful, Michael Cera) 'decide' to have sex one night and in 'a chair that started it all.' Lo, behold, she's now with child and after an abortion debate within herself, she decides on making a obviously unhappy couple happy again. But, will a child complete the Pennysaver advertising's couple's family? Will Juno find who she's always been searching for? Will she ever light that pipe she incessantly sucking on, even though she's pregnant? The supporting cast is excellent – including great scenes with the always wonderful J.K. Simmons, Allison Janney and (definitely not the normal role for) Jason Bateman. The score is good, the cinematography is surprisingly great and, as mentioned, the soundtrack that started the movie with a bang, is absolutely and breathtakingly marvelous.While still giving the enormously hilarious movie 5/5 stars, I'm surprised on how toned down Cera was in this. As a big fan of his, and how he normally steals every scene he's involved in and usually has the best dialogue, it was amazing on how reserved he was in this while letting Page command the screen. Probably that was the intention, but it was freaky not seeing Cera dominate the screen.Nevertheless, coming from a fan of just a handful of teen-related movies, such as Clueless, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Election and, of course, the John Hughes collection, I add this almost masterpiece of a teen angst film to the list. It was so real, so involving and so funny, I can't wait to finally see it a third time.Now, you must buy this movie and following its closing credits, search and purchase the soundtrack. If you loved the movie, you should already have a crush on the music.",10,0,1,3 May 2013
L.A. Confidential," Don't be hush-hush – WATCH THIS MOVIE
","(This is Part III of my 'I Love the 90s!' special review series. From review #490-499, this being 492, I revisit what I feel are classics from the 90s. Unfortunately, one (Hellraiser: Bloodline) didn't fit the 'classics' genre I'm referring to, but the rest, including this MASTERPIECE, I loved.)I want to get three things I didn't favor in what is a MASTERPIECE, a CLASSIC and one of the best movies of ALL TIME, out of the way. Thankfully, these three are NOT the movie's fault; blame it on marketing and the idiocy of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, or the Oscar buffoons.#1 Kim Basinger does NOT belong on the cover, let alone half the cover. Not only did she play a small part, not only did she only play in just one of dozens of story lines, but the other actors outshined her throughout.#2 What's the deal (still on Basinger) with Kimmy winning the only acting award at the Oscars? Heck, she was the only one nominated! Sure, 1997 was tough competition for stars – eventual winner-Jack Nicholson was excellent in As Good As it Gets – but the three leads: Pearce, Crowe and Spacey, not to mention Cromwell and DeVito, were all on TOP of their game. Perhaps the Oscars said 'Boy, we can't pick between all of these excellent performances, so why even nominate any of them.' Of course, that didn't stop them from nominating both Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis in Thelma & Louise a few years back. Furthermore, she was, in fact, good, looked gorgeous and believable in her role, but she was the weakest link in a long line of excellent performances.#3 I did like Titanic. Sure. But in the 1997's best picture line up (remember, back then, they only did the top 5) consisting of As Good As it Gets, Good Will Hunting, The Full Monty, Titanic and L.A. Confidential, L.A. Confidential took the cake far and above the rest. In fact, As Good As it Gets was better than Titanic. But, they do like their grand epicsI do want to thank them, fast forwarding 13 years to this year (2010) they dissed Avatar. At least they got that right.Whewnow I can praise one of my all time favorite movies. Crowe gave his best performance in spades and layers. He'll even tell you he's not smart enough to solve his dilemmas, but still shows the depth what others say about him. Then there's the all-around master, Spacey, who added much needed humor and elegance to the film. Pearce, wowtwo words: Clark Kent. And it was refreshing from both his excellent portrayal, but also to see Clark Kent in an alternative role.In addition to those fantastic performances, Cromwell and DeVito also were near perfect. Also, you have a great score, mood is fantastic, cinematography was suburb – watch it in Bluray if you can, it's gorgeous and it contains one of the most complex and wonderful scripts I have even seen on screen. I've been told they even toned it down from even more multistory-lines from its source material, its novel. Honestly, there's so much in this movie, I don't know if I could even take any more inter-webbed , overlapping subplots.In fact, it would be hard to even give a synopsis as I normally do, but I'll try.Picture it, 1950s L.A. – a place people want to come to: escape or be noticed, get rich or die trying or to sleep with real movie stars or fake ones. The story begins with the semi-narrator, gossip-columnist, Sid Hudgens (DeVito) who pays for his storieswait, I let's start over.(This paragraph might contain some heavy spoilers, skip over if you haven't seen the movie.) There are at least 8 main leads, all intersecting one way or another, leading this way, that way, and let me make one thing clear: I challenge anyone who has never seen this, read any of the spoilers or the book to predict where any of the multilayered stories are headed. There are the cops: Suave Jack (Spacey,) Meathead Bud (Crowe,) Clark Kent Ed (Pearce,) Do-No-Right Dudley (Cromwell) and D.A., or dick-n-ass, Ellis (Rifkin.) Then there's Loose Lynn (Basinger,) Vicious(-tongued) Sid (DeVito) and Pimpin' Pierce (Strathairn.) There's actually more, but these are the eight leads. Eight!As much as I loved the (remake) Ocean's Eleven, where they also had a magnitude of characters, all with their individual backgrounds and depth, this movie handled it better. Ocean's had more than 10 characters, duh, but in reality, they focused on the main three actors: Clooney, Pitt and Damon. Here, everyone gets their own screen time, each have incredible depth and range thanks to the actors involved and each have their back stories along with actual growth.To really make the movie basic or dumbed down for one central synopsis, it boils down to go-getter Ed who's made responsible for solving a multi-slaying homicide, but he doesn't think that the outcome is true justice. Honestly, I think that's the one line that's constant as there are at least 5-6 more supposedly irrelevant plots hanging around.When you begin to watch L.A. Confidential for the first time (or in my case, the fifth or so) it just seems a little complicated at times. Even I have a little hard time following each thread, even when I rewatch it again. And that's one of the beauties of this movie: each experience is brand new. And even if you 'get' the movie as a whole, the next time you watch it, you can sit back and focus on the crisp scenery, the richness of 1950s Los Angeles or the delicious performances. If you don't really feel you're there, quite honestly, I don't know what other movie or any film noir that will. Obviously: SEE IT!",10,1,2,1 December 2012
Concussion," The NFL: The New Freaking Liars
","Out of the league of the same year's Spotlight, but I am still glad this doctor's story was told and the sins were sought out.It is far from a secret to anyone that knows me that I loathe football. But, oddly, this damaging story to that sport didn't make me hate it more. Big bad corporations that America can't simply live without will always do damage control and lie through their teeth to both keep profits up and their product sill producingeven at the cost of their own 'employee's' lives and families.No, the movie, Concussion, didn't make me hate it more, but it did make me understand the dangers more and appreciation for humble people who want to only do the right thing. Since I couldn't care less about the game, I'm actually blind to how much trauma these players accumulate. Until now.The movie follows the walking ten-page-resume, Dr. Bennet Omalu, from when he stumbled upon the horrific side-effects of playing football and through the obvious lies from the NFL. That's a pretty quick and easy summery of this two-hour film, and don't get me wrong: this is completely worth seeing, if not for the triumph of the good Doctor, but for the fantastic performance from Will Smith. Admittedly, I haven't seen all of his movies, like his other Oscar- worthy performances, but this, by far, was the greatest acting I have seen from him. There wasn't a shot where I didn't see Smith as Omalu. He was completely transformed and I praise his talents for this role and proving he's not the same note he most always is.This 'praise' isn't to take away from the supporting cast, which were also pretty darn good, as well as the filmmaking here. This was, indeed, a well shot and sometimes beautiful film.Was it perfect? Eh, no, but there's not much to complain about outside nitpicking the over-dramatized clichés critics see at least on a biweekly basis. Totally worth seeing and hope more do see it so they know the plays they're cheering on Sunday are the same ones that could possibly kill these men.***Final thoughts: I am uncertain on Will Smith's take on the whole 'Oscar So White' controversy I heard that began with his wife, Jada. Actors get snubbed all the time and wrong ones get in there, as well. Not just by my opinion, but usually, universally we can agree some just don't belong in the race and many great films and performances were overlooked. That said, I believe, no actor should choose a role to gain an Oscar and then proceed to act their asses off just to get that award. Sorry, I saw that too many times from Leoand it was such a distraction from his movies. I'm just glad Leo finally won so he can just go back to acting. I digress. Smith gave a great performance in a movie with a message we need to hear. His reward will be more people seeing thisand I hope they do.",8,1,4,1 April 2016
Don Jon," Don's Johnson
","I love the promotional poster that includes, in big caps: STELLAR, HILARIOUS, GENUINE, EMOTIONAL, EDGY and CONFIDENT. Hey, Don Jon! Did you and I see the same movie?Absolutely this movie was not bad and a tad original – I said 'a tad!' – but it wasn't worth all the praise it put on its own poster. It's a very basic story of addiction but not groundbreaking, especially in its 'recovery' phase.Jon, Don Jon, is addicted to online porn. While not alone – say, 5% of American adults haven't partook with said pleasures, he can't get enough, which, I guess, puts him squarely in the 80% truly addicted to it. This is not to say Jon doesn't have a (night) life as he does also partake in the females at the local discotheque.After years of banging both the human form and the hand-held kind, he does settle down with a '9' in the form of Scarlet Johansson. But, is she enough to rid him of his 'problem at hand?' Or will the older, wiser and higher co-student of his get him to remember life after (on)line?The movie attempts to shock and splash multiples of porn images on the screen. For anyone over, say 14, none of this is new. Maybe not so much in a movie, but it's not shocking to most. But, it is funny and genuine at times. And I absolutely adored and loved Julianne Moore in this.Ever since Hannibal, she's continued to un-impress me, sadly. This is not a great thing to say about her, because I know she's so much more. But, up until this, she's been in a downward spiral. Mercifully, while not perfect, she's definitely rebounded here and is absolutely worth watching this movie for.Overall, it's a recommend, but only for those with open minds. For those who have any bit of a mind that's closed, or even ajar, stay away. Watch those G-rated Kirk Cameron films for 'pleasure.'* * * Final thoughts: Joseph, who's been plenty better in other films, didn't do a bad job here and while not amateurish in direction, it wasn't up to what he could do. I look forward to seeing more from him.",6,1,3,18 January 2014
Deadpool 2," Wait. We Still Have Cable in the Future?
","Usually I save this to the end, but just like the two Deadpool movies, we must operate all over the timeline: DON'T WAIT UNTIL THE END OF THE CREDITS; THERE IS NOTHING THERE.Now, the beginning of the end credits, absolutely. In fact, you MUST see those final scenes as the credits just begin as they (kinda 2) are thee best end credits scenes in any marvel movie EVER. They were absolutely the icing on the already best cake a Deadpool follow-up could've been. Admittedly, I was worried this would suffer from sequelitis and almost didn't see it despite loving the first one wholeheartedly. Mercifully, I woke up in enough time to catch a Dolby® screening and let me say this: Not as great as the original, but pretty damn close and extremely worth seeing.(Even) better soundtrack, absolutely hilarious jokes, inventive new ideas on the original's setup and excellent use of each character and their individual features are just a few of the many positives here. I was rolling in laughter for a grand majority and in awe on how they began with the same thread as the original and broke off with clever writing and directions - totally expanded the singular R-Rated Deadpool universe as if this was his own Avenger movie.Deadpool's on top of the world, or at least all-around it, with fighting 'worse bad guys' with more maximum effort and maintaining his love life until tragedy strikes sending him on a journey of self-discovery, love and family. F that. It's just a fun kick-A adventure. The one thing that irked me though, was the pacing and length. Several scenes went on far too long even though some of those were meant for comedy and others were just poor choices. And you will feel every one of those 119 minutes. It's almost as if they felt this would bomb and they could never make another Deadpool movie. Hogwash. Of course, there'll be a third, fourth, etc. Can't wait to see this again and with the (now) knowledge that the movie feels too long at times, I'll probably enjoy it tons more the second time. There is so much in here to love and so many jokes I *know* I missed. Heck, I re-watched the original last night for the xxx'th time and caught one hilarious joke I must've missed the many times I've seen it before.ABSOLUTE recommendation. Really need to see the first one, but...nope, you must see the first one. But, hey, I gave that one 4½/5 stars so you really can't go wrong.***Final thoughts: While I began with the warning not to stay to the very end credits as there's nothing there, I will say the music choices all the way to the very end were worth it. I already loved the soundtrack, but it actually improved with the songs they played while the credits rolled.",8,3,6,19 May 2018
X-Men," X Marked the Spot
","I'll admit I'm not one for origin stories. Even with the original Superman: The Movie, Iron Man and the rebooted Batman Begins, I'm thoroughly impatient for them to get to what I came/paid for to see: the character in the suit. That said, I enjoyed every minute of X-Men. Even the Nazi intro.I don't even know how they could've made these characters any more interesting. Especially Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) who seemed to fit perfectly in those claws. And though most of the superheroes were younger, the main characters were much older – a rarity in superhero movies. That was refreshing to see more of an adult and comic book adventure.Dr. Xavier (Stewart) has taken the high road in educating young runaway mutants at his school while his old pal, Eric or Magneto (McKellen) curved left and wants to prove to the world mutants are the next big thing, by any means (he feels) necessary. Pretty much both were at opposite ends of the same goal: mutant acceptance. Unfortunately, this is an age-old story of true life wars on racism and homophobia, and it never seems to end. Here, in X-Men, at least we can enjoy an adventure movie while learning tolerance.I definitely liked both characters, and Stewart was perfect for his role. But, McKellen was delicious as the deep Magneto. He played the 'bad guy' as not so bad, if you pull back the layers.Meanwhile, we have a least a dozen other characters, all given a perfect amount of time to develop and make us care who lives or dies. Wolverine, a personal favorite of mine, probably has the biggest background (so much so, they continue his journey into his sordid past through 2 sequels and a spin off. Enough already!) but it's also the most interesting this time around. The weakest is Rogue (Paquin) and, like Wolverine, they stretch out her story to the thinnest level in sequels to come.While some of the characters were as weak as Rogue – namely Cyclops (Marsden), most were awesome to watch and even better on how each person's power and personality fed off each other to further the plot along.And speaking of whichMagneto has developed the power to make us mortals into the evolved mutants and plans to use a summit to prove mutants are superior. It's the X-Men to the rescue! Though the movie had a decent budget, it almost felt like they held back a little, avoiding some of the more popular X-Men characters so they could test the waters, obviously for further installments. That was probably the movie's biggest flaw. They didn't do that with Superman: The Movie or Batman. Thankfully, the film was a (deservedly) hit and they were able to expand.This movie is highly recommended. Great action, score, acting, depth, originality anda message! I would even say to see it for non-comic book fans. If they ever make a Justice League movie or The Avengers, let's hope it's even a 1/10 of how great this movie was.",9,0,1,1 May 2010
Spider-Man 3," Meanwhile...Meanwhile...Enough!
","Yes, I am aware Spider-Man comes from the comic books. And I've read enough of them that the word 'meanwhile' shows up quite often. Unfortunately, they didn't place 'meanwhile' in Spider-Man 3.I don't know how many subplots are in Spider-Man 3, but I'll try to list them. All. And with the appropriate word 'meanwhile' to transition them, as they should've in the movie:Mary Jane's finally on Broadway. Meanwhile, Harry's still seeking revenge on Spider-Man for the supposed murder of his father, a.k.a. Green Goblin. Meanwhile, Peter wants to marry MJ. Meanwhile, an alien force lands on Earth. Meanwhile, Flint, related to the death of Uncle Ben, breaks out of prison. Meanwhile, Flint's fighting to make his sick daughter alive and his ex at bay. Meanwhile, Harry gets temporary amnesia. Meanwhile, Brock is yearning to be Spidey's new press agent. Meanwhile, Gwen is dangerously modeling during an accident and Spidey rescues her. Meanwhile, her father, the police captain, grants Spidey the key to the city. Meanwhile, MJ gets fired for bad acting. Meanwhile, Peter proposes and gets turned down from MJ. Meanwhile, romance sparks up between MJ and Harry. Meanwhile, Sandman and Spidey fight. Meanwhile, the black goo, a.k.a. alien Venom attaches to Spidey. Meanwhile, Spidey gets loose and becomes a real person, albeit aggressive. Meanwhile, Spidey loses the Venom to Brock. Meanwhile, Brock becomes a cartoon black Spidey. Meanwhile, Harry's father's ghost visits and convinces him to blackmail MJ and fight Spidey. Meanwhile, Sandman and Venom team up to hurt Spidey. Meanwhile, Peter makes MJ jealous with Gwen. Meanwhile, Dr. Connors warns of the black goo. Meanwhile, Peter's apartment manager, daughter and Aunt gives good advice while either criticizing his place or again, asking for rent. Meanwhile, J. Jonah Jameson is having pill problems. Meanwhile, Peter learns to dance, horribly, but it was meant for comic relief, I suppose. Meanwhile, the 'Alfred'-butler reveals at the most opportune time what Harry needed to hear to move the plot along.(That last one made me actually crack up in the theatre – Seriously? He chose that moment after 3 movies to reveal the truth behind the death of the Green Goblin?)Wow. Did I miss any? I understand that's not entirely in order and that's not all of the multiple subplots, but I count twenty-six subplots. Twenty-six??? Seriously? This has to be a record.I've seen this movie a few times, and though it's not horrible, in fact it's decently filmed and Grace brings a lot to his role as Brock/Venom, there are way too many things going on. It certainly had the 'Batman' dilemma. By the time the original Batman series got to part IV, there were so many villains, so many characters, so many subplots, it was so bogged down, it was unwatchable. And that's sad. This could've been so much better if they focused on only Venom as a villain. Or just Sandman as a villain. Or signaling out Gwen as a love interest. Or even Spidey going bad. Or the now-age-old New Goblin as a rival.No, they had to put 26+ ideas in one. The biggest problem with the entire series is pacing. Going on way too long. Here, in part III, they not only decided to actually increase the length, but add way too many ideas.Unfortunately, that was the movie's undoing. Despite some awesome action sequences (Harry Vs. Peter in the opening and the absolute comic-book ending fight) the movie seriously should be skipped. I remember watching this in theatres thinking: 'Oh, I can't wait to watch this on DVD, so I can just skip to the 30 minutes (of 139) that I actually liked.'Speaking of which, I'm guessing we're not supposed to side with aggressive Spider-Man, made that way with the alien goo. Unlike the other Super-Hero Part 3, where Kal-El goes bad in Superman III, I actually liked Peter/Black-Spidey much better than the red/blue good-guy. At least this Dark-Spidey got paid for once.Let's hope they get back on track for part IV. Ideas: go back to one villain. Lose the 'love conflict story' between the two leads – Oh My God, that's been played out for almost seven hours of the series. In addition, if there is a wedding, yeah, like there won't be, make it quick and get back to the action. And, finally, fire Willem Dafoe – enough with the Green Goblin!!!!",3,0,3,20 November 2009
Yes Man," Say 'YES!' but just once for this movie
","Yes, it's predictable (extremely.) Yes, it's typical (Carrey.) Yes, it's a rip-off (Liar, Liar.) But, I find the most important 'yes' is: Yes, it's actually funny and in some scenes genuine and heart-warming.Well, some of it is. It's nice to see Carrey taking on more of an 'adult' comedy role, not toning down his language humor. So, I found myself laughing a lot in Yes Man.Unfortunately, every time I was laughing, or enjoying myself, it took a dive, whether a very slow-moving scene or an unoriginal idea or just into predictable territory. These were the movie's undoing. Oh, and that the leads (May-December at its best) had zero chemistry. That didn't help either.The nice thing about the movie, unlike Carrey's better movies, Liar, Liar or The Mask, in this one, he's given the 'choice' to be 'a better man.' So, I liked the so-called realism he finally portrayed.Carl is a definite 'no-man' in his life or job as a loan officer at a bank. When given the chance to attend a guru's workshop to say 'yes' to opportunities, he actually attends and tries it out with success. When he does, in fact, say no, coincidentally, bad things happen.There's a lesson to be learned, as in 90% of Carrey's films and predictability, you'll see it coming. Whether in his yes-choices or romance with the typically very good Deschanel (Carl's love interest) but in this case very misplaced. I loved her so much in (500) Days of Summer, but here, she looks so out of place, it's painful on how she tried to be 'perky.' For fans of Carrey's earlier work (Liar, Liar remains my favorite of his comedies) this is worth a viewing. In fact, it's his best comedy since Bruce Almighty (2003) but one of his weakest movies. And that's sad. For a lot of the movie, it's down-right hilarious and had scenes that can teach 'loving life,' but for most of the movie, it's so boring, expected and clichéd.",4,0,1,2 December 2009
The Terminator," I'll Be Bare
","One of the most amazing aspects of 'The Terminator,' was the story. Despite the extremely low budget, and the equally low-budget feel of the film, the movie had an extremely well thought out story. This is evident when they took this film into three additional sequels, made a mega-star out of Schwarzenegger and even produced a short-lived TV series. Unfortunately, despite the quality of story and the sci-fi aspect of the plot line, I viewed it more as a horror story than an action picture it was meant to be. I think it was the genre of films produced back on and around 1984. Only this one stood out, with solid performances by Hamilton, Biehn and, of course, Schwarzenegger. In the defining movie based on man vs. machines (tell me the makers of 'The Matrix' wasn't thinking about this movie throughout), comes a 'Judgment Day' apocalyptic war when machines take over in 1997 and man spends the rest of his days fighting the mistake we made. Back in time comes a 'terminator' to kill the mother of the resistance leader in a valid tactical move, but thankfully, the leader also sends someone back to protect her – giving us valuable information in the process. While some of the graphics (and hair, oh, God, the hair) were extremely dated (also see: the closing, when Schwarzenegger finally loses his skin), the movie holds up very well, even 25 years later. And it's all thanks to the interesting and original story as well as the acting. Many imitated this movie; none came close to the heart of 'The Terminator.' I even loved the ending. Of course, it opened the doors to sequels, but if it ended with the storm coming, it would've been okay. They produced a quality product that honestly didn't need a continuation.",8,0,1,2 October 2009
Cloverfield," Godzilla VS. the Blair Witch
","What an achievement 'Cloverfield' was. From no-name actors, to no-name title, to one of the most influential advertising campaigns to the movie it mimicked: 'Blair Witch Project.' It also ranks as one of the shortest movies I've ever seen (actual screen time: 73 minutes) yet it seems 3x that. And this includes a 19 minute introduction that seems like 4x that. So, in total, you get a real 54 minutes of movie you wanted: Monster attacking NYC. Unfortunately, it's short on depth for characters, even with that lovey-dovey 19 minute prelude with yuppies we are supposed to care about, but don't. If anything, we care more about the fabulous view from their apartment(s) than their shallow lives. After the initial 19 shaky-camera minutes trying to find out who's who and why, you get an almost identical remake of the remake of 'Godzilla' (1998.) You're treated to a giant whatchamacalit who spawns off little creatures to get in those 'hard-to-reach' areas the beast can't fit in. Okay, I liked the movie. It's fun, it's completely realistic; where there is complete chaos and without the news at your fingertips, you really don't know what's going on. You have to give it to the film makers to making possibly the most plausible monster B-Movie of all time. Unfortunately, even with (as mentioned) just 54 minutes of true footage, you get the feeling they stretched this out as thin as it would go. In addition, you get incredibly, and I mean down-right unbelievably stupid people to follow during this crisis. Half the movie is a senseless rescue mission. My friend and I made a pack following the film: if I were caught, leave me be, save yourself! Honestly, I would love to see a sequel, to learn more, but please drop the camera.",6,1,1,16 October 2009
Ready Player One," Bad Easter Eggs
","Nostalgia...is a thing of the past. And so is nostalgia.Had this movie come out 20 years ago...fantastic. I would've marveled at the countless references to the 1980-70s. But, too bad: there's been so many HEY, LOOK! HERE'S A REFERENCE TO THE PAST! movies and TV shows recently, that frankly, I'm sick of looking into the past. This movie is so outdated by this point, it actually makes sense why they released the failure of The Darkest Minds a few months later. YA movie series are past their prime long before 2018.Basically, this OVERLONG movie is a cartoon with bad graphics when it comes to humans. Which is weird. In TODAY'S time, these bad human effects is about normal, but this movie's set in the near future where this really should've been dealt with. But, I digress. This movie sucks.What you get is a horrible future of humans that never work and just play VR to escape not working. Some pretty boy is the obvious savior when an Easter Egg is presented to, I guess, save all mankind. This movie has zero heart, characters that have zero chemistry, generic nostalgia in graphics and score and the one saving grace is what they didn't ruin in the trailers: the Stephen King reference.I perked up then. It's about an hour into a bloated 2 hour, 20 minutes mess. One of the million pop culture references takes center stage for quite a bit of screen time and I loved it. But, then it went away and the bad writing and stereotypical playbook happened.This story was so concerned with showing better movies and ideas of the past, it forgot to have one of its own. When the movie was out of 'the matrix,' I was depressed. When it was in 'the past films nostalgia' I was checked out. Again, nostalgia is definitely nothing new these days.Absolutely not recommended. One of Steven Spielberg's worst.***Final thoughts: AT LEAST, Tye Sheridan and Win Morisaki were cute. When we left The Matrix, those two were pleasant to look at. Everything else: ugly as sin.",2,1,3,11 August 2018
The Hateful Eight," In the Dogshouse
","The funny thing about QT's second back-to-back western is that I've been avoiding it because A: I'm not a western fan and B: I really wanted Quentin to go back to his roots in modern day. Boy, I couldn't have been more wrong.The Hateful Eight might as well be a reshoot of his first big breakthrough: Reservoir Dogs, albeit with a new/old setting. Personally, I wasn't a fan of the Dogs movie initially – I wrote a scathing 1/5 star review for my college newspaper back in 1992 about it, and then changed my mind years later after getting accustomed to Quentin's style. It still wasn't my favorite and nowhere near the top, but I really appreciated it more with my second viewing. This, my friends, takes that concept and improves upon ittremendously. Even with it being a western.Adding to what I said above about my hesitation of yet another QT western, I wasn't looking forward to the three hour time frame, either. Nevertheless, I went to go see it and liked it up front. The dialogue was very good as were the characters I found intriguing. Still, I was wondering how much they could stretch out for 180 minutes or so. Luckily, this story, the twists and unfolding scenes kept me glued and it only continuously got better.On a side note: as much as I liked it as it progressed, I kept saying to myself 'Eh, it's good, but I never wanna see it again.' I really need to stop talking to myself, because with less than an hour to the finish line, I made it my mission to see it again. And maybe, again. I really loved it that much once it concluded.I digress. The movie begins with a post-Civil War Boba Fett picking up two hitchhikers and landing at a little rest-stop bar/sanctuary where they meet more of the title characters to wait out the concurrent blizzard. Who's who, what do they want and how they all relate to each other commands our attention for the next 2½ hours. I really dumbed down the entire synopsis there, and believe me: you'd want me to be as vague as possible when it comes to what you're in store to explore and learn on your own. Despite 80% of the movie taking place in one room (SEE: the Reservoir Dogs reference,) it's just so damn interesting to hear everyone's story, words, backgrounds and motives. Well done, Quentin. You really nailed this out of the park and gave us your best since Kill Bill Vol. 2. I wish I had seen this before posting my top 10 of the year. Granted it wouldn't be number 1or #2but it would've made a solid third place finish for the best of 2015. That's not to downplay this FANTASTIC film – I just happened to see two better. And despite that, you NEED TO SEE: The Hateful Eight. Right now. Drop everything and see it.",9,1,11,10 January 2016
"I, Tonya"," Skate Around the Truth
","Which part of this is true? Skip that, just watch old truTV Presents World's Dumbest episodes.I only know Tonya from World's Dumbest. But, what they showed in this movie makes sense. Just wish it wasn't two freaking hours.Basically, they show an incredibly bad mother, an incredibly bad daughter, a bad husband, a bad fat friend, etc, etc. No one's likable in this.I've been told to see this for Allison Janney's performance for 2017's Best Supporting Actress nomination. True, she's excellent albeit a terrible individual. She's truly scum and lives up to the hype. My vote still goes for Laurie Metcalf for Lady Bird. Both are deserving, but at least Laurie has some traits to hold onto. Janney was just pure evil throughout.As a whole, the movie's okay. Not anything to fully recommend, as you know the ending if you've lived as long as I have. And besides, they kept telling you, this may/may not be the truth. Thanks for the honesty, but I'd still like to know. ***Final thoughts: I just wanna believe she didn't know and still enjoy those World's Dumbest episodes without cringing.",5,2,4,19 February 2018
We Were Soldiers," This is perfect to recruit new soldiers!
","Strange, I had a weird feeling during 'We Were Soldiers.' I thought of aliens. No, I don't believe in extra terrestrials, but I had such an unusual feeling that if aliens were watching us when the attacks happened in this movie or in real life, what were they thinking? Oh, yeah – 'IDIOTS.' How on Earth can such sophisticated beings plan on continuing when they can't seem to get any conflict resolved? I honestly don't want to sound un-American or un-Patriotic, but what a bunch of losers the human kind can be? For the first part of 'Soldiers' we are given the normal/boring/typical vision of 1960's United States before it sent young men into a never-ending conflict bend on making money for the rich. Then we plunge into a fierce battle of unprepared Americans for the remainder of the movie. Very graphic, I might add. So it does add a lot of the realism to WAR – or 'conflict.' Unfortunately, it barely attempts an 'unbiased' view of both sides fighting (notice a lot of sympathy on the American side, and somewhat, or little on the Vietnam side.) OK, I admit, I'm thoroughly ignorant on the whole war, especially this one battle, but someone had to get rich. Maybe more than one person. Again, let's focus on the outside influence that might be watching – perhaps, aliens – and see what they think of higher ups that plan on getting rich off of human beings being inhumanely slaughtered. Perhaps, I am bitter, anti-war, but seriously look at this enormously realistic view of a battle and tell me that it was all worth killing living, human beings foroh I'm sorry, what again were they trying to accomplish and failed? Side note: as much as I'm a Gibson/Elliott fan, they seemed very bulletproof whenever they stood up. Hmmmm.Overall it wasn't a terrible movie, (in fact, the fight scenes were thoroughly realistic) but it's so depressing on how STUPID people are. Seriously, you're a general, or top-ranking military person, or President (and wife) and you have absolutely no problem telling someone to go and kill someone of the same species (and die trying) because it will make money for some fool in the long run? I have the deepest respect for those who put their lives on the line for normal civilians, but condemn the leaders who put them in that position. This movie made me think I was at Woodstock protesting (before my time): 'Make Love Not War.'Question: Am I supposed to praise this General played by Gibson? Am I supposed to think, well, he did his 'civic' duty and lead these men to the death because he was not supposed to question a higher rank?They finish the movie with the typical journey down the Vietnam wall memorial. Honestly, I don't see them as fools. I would suspect a great majority, if not 99.9%, were drafted by the same people who wanted more money – hmm, doesn't it always come down to money? I truly honor their lives as they're the innocents. It's simply unbearable how those who planned on profit for people's souls could still sleep at night.",3,1,3,3 September 2009
Ocean's Twelve," Baker's Dozen Done Right
","There are a lot of people who didn't like Ocean's Twelve. Enough so, I feel they made Ocean's Thirteen as a make-up movie, à la Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade when Part Temple of Doom was such a joke. Of course, using that theory, they still need to make Indy 5 for that tragedy of part IVAt any rate, I'm a HUGE 2001 Ocean's Eleven fan. I've seen that movie more than a, ah hem, dozen times. This one, not as much, but I still appreciate it when I do see it.Is it anywhere close to the magic that (somewhat) part one held? No. But, it's a fun addition and original to the max.Basically, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and crew stole more than $150 million in the original movie from three Las Vegas casinos. They were set to get away with it and live happily ever after, or so people who only saw part one would count on.In this follow-up, the man they stole from, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) comes a'looking and teams up with another thief to ensure they pay back the money with interest. Playing it by ear, they cook up some European schemes to 'earn' back the money so they don't get murdered, or worse.Despite the lack of the gorgeous Vegas backdrop, or the normality of the original, Ocean's Twelve does manage to capture the same crew with pinpoint accuracy on their individual characters and the dialogue is still incredibly rich and absolutely hilarious. I always love George Clooney and mostly love Brad Pitt – together, whether this is the original or not, they certainly deliver in the fun I watched time and again in the original.In truth, this movie is a mess at times. It's random and despite the original aspect of characters having to make up for their sins in the first movieit's still a ton of fun, funny and the cinematography and scenes are crisp and fun to look at.In truthPart Two or Twelve, honestly, I wish this movie hadn't been made. I loved them just getting away with it in the original and riding off into the sunset. Butif it had to be made, I would have strongly preferred this version. I am a fan. And I endorse this.",8,1,1,17 August 2013
BlacKkKlansman," Power to These Heroes
","Nice to see Alec Baldwin play two racists very well: in this movie and as the president on Saturday Night Live.And BlacKkKlansman truly shows the connection between the two.In probably Spike Lee's best film, this gorgeously shot, wonderfully paced, often hilarious and definitely, superiorly acted movie is deserving of the Best Picture Oscar. Now, I haven't seen all of the films nominated for 2018, but I can say: if this wins, we all win.The OBVIOUS son of Denzel Washington poses as KKK-inductee over the phone and sends the Star Wars, black-dressed white man to infiltrate the terrible, racist group in the 1970s. The wonderfulness of this movie is trying to keep ahead and aligned with the lies of the cops and their undercover work and relationships.Truthfully, like Natalie Portman in the Star Wars sequels, I'm not a fan of Adam Driver in the latest trilogy. That said, since I've seen him elsewhere, as in this and Logan Lucky, I'm totally on the Driver-Train. He was as real as you could be in this.Now, that's not discounting the excellent job the rest of the cast did. I liked everyone in this. I definitely liked the idiots who ran the klan in Colorado. Nothing feels better than to see such hate get punished.Washington really drives this project and it's hard not to root for him the whole way. Just too bad his character didn't stop the entire race of hate. The movie's final shots literally had me in tears and my eyes red...from both crying and anger towards this group.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. And I'd like to see more of the pain this disgusting group brought upon themselves.***Final thoughts: If only this movie wasn't based on a true story. I would've loved to see more of these evil-doers get punished and hard.",8,5,11,30 January 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spiderman, Spiderman, Does Whatever an Iron Man Can
","Scratching head. Was the 'Homecoming' subtitle in reference to the two- second Homecoming Dance scene??Also weird: in a movie starring Marisa Tomei, Robert Downey Jr., Michael Keaton, Jon Favreau and a decent Penis Parker, Tom Holland, the most and ONLY interesting character in the movie was the hilarious sidekick, Ned (Jacob Batalon.) With the exception of some funny background characters, like some of the teachers and definitely out-of-nowhere-and-everywhere Michelle, Ned was the one I felt was worth the price of admission for.This says something about this version. I barely cared for anyone in this movie. On whether they lived, succeeded or fell in love. I was just given information, i.e. a ton of movie exposition, and was told to accept it. That's alright if one doesn't want to follow the golden rule of 'Show, Don't Tell,' but I grew up on that method. I'd rather feel something for characters and story-arcs by means of showing me emotion than being told how to feel.I digress. The movie wasn't necessarily bad, but it was almost dead- center okay. It had a TON of hilarious, laugh-out-loud moments, again, mostly involving Ned, but also the teacher's reactions and public service announcements from Cap. And the 15% or so of the movie that was devoted to action, it was entertaining with some fresh ideas.Basically, Parker spends his day chasing his idol vs having that great power/great responsibly we've known him to learn. Finally, he literally becomes Iron Man to follow leads his mentors won't listen to. Will Parker become his own again and save the day? Sheesh, I couldn't even keep a straight face while typing that.One thing before the movie, and obviously set up in the MCU's Civil War movie, that irked me tremendously was Tony Stark's involvement of Spider-Man's suit and training. This is NOT the Spider-Man I grew up with, nor was shown in any adaptation on screen. Spider-Man is supposed to make his own suit, figure out his own special powers, solve the mystery and become the MAN part of his nameall on his own.Luckily, with a somewhat decent script here, they devote a little time to that, but for the majority of the movie we were watching Iron Man Jr. on screen vs. Spider-Man. While some of those scenes were absolutely hilarious and added a lot to the enjoyment, this never truly felt like a Spider-Man movie to me. I'd go as far to say it's a full-blown MCU movie with co-co-star Spider-Man.It's not a movie I want to see again any time soon and can't really recommend it for the big screen since the majority of enjoyment you'll get is just by laughing at the jokes in-between the enormously long lulls of inaction. ***Final thoughts: Here's my ranking of the Spider-Man movies, excluding his Civil War cameo since it was just that:1. Spider-Man2. Spider-Man 23. Spider-Man 34. Spider-Man: Homecoming5. The Amazing Spider-Man 26. The Amazing Spider-Man",5,4,8,22 July 2017
Fast & Furious 6," Furious George and the Fast Cars
","A Superman II opening recap for the four people who had never seen any of the previous films, yet actually bought a ticket to a sixth installment of a series, only proves how incredibly silly these films are. And truth be told, I finally gave up 'critiquing' the franchise and had fun with the nonsense known as Fast Five. I had fun, here as well.Furious 6 – with all the name changes, I can't wait to see what they'll call part VII, is just as silly and over-the-top as the other entries, but at least they don't pretend to be anything but a big-budgeted Grindhouse movie. That trend began with #5 and that's probably why I enjoyed both of those and rank them the best of the series.Really, the paper-thin plot is incidental to the number chase and fight scenes. But, just for fun, the faux pas Ocean's Eleven crew is reassembled in order to take down an even worse bad guy and in return, they get pardons in order to return home to the US.Seriously, that's all you need to know about the script. And chances are, anyone who bought a ticket to this had no intention of finding any depth here. Just fast cars, beautiful women and muscular men doing macho thingsyou know, the norm. And you'll get all that in spades, even though it slows down for a tremendous amount of the film.When the heat is on, it's great, no-brainer, entertainment, despite the incredibly ridiculous stunts at times (Vin Diesel's mid air rescue was about as real as Jason Statham's over-the-bay car bomb heroics in Transporter 2.) There were a lot of 'Wow. Really?' moments I had, but more stuff I had fun watching, such as when they introduced some huge dude towards the end, I knew instantly he was going to be The Rock's match. When that came to pass, albeit a far-too-quick scene, it was enjoyable.It's best just to sit back and enjoy. I mean, when I was a kid, the man in the rubber Godzilla suit looked just as realistic as these guys.",5,1,4,13 July 2013
The Expendables," The 'D-' Team
","Sure, Sylvester Stallone isn't the most bankable star. He's washed up and knows it. I appreciate that he knows, though writing and directing that theory into an incredibly shallow, talentless and pointless movie containing characters with zero depth or chemistry between each other and bringing other D-List stars down with himis just plain wrong.The Expendables didn't have much going for it, except for taking the Freddy Vs. Jason idea to a whole new level. Not a better level, but just expanding the cast of has-beens. So, I guess the only way for the film to go is up, upon viewing? NO. It started low and got worse.The action was so few and far between that when you finally got to one of the few scenes, though they were decent, you're left so bored, it's hard to remember at that time this is, in fact, an action flick. It's a no-brainer that the cast basically has no brains left, so the expectations of them suddenly performing Hamlet was null. Yet, I really wanted to see something, anything out of them. Not only was each one, bypassing Jason Statham as Lee Christmas who stood far above EVERY other individual, so dull, boring, one-note, incredibly UNFUNNY with jokes and one-liners seen from a neighboring county, but not one had an ounce of chemistry with each other. It's as if Mr. Stallone asked them, not that they need a reason to get their first paycheck in years, and they signed on without so much as seeing the script.And speaking of which, was there a script? We have the lesser of A-Team movies this summer where as an elite group of highly trained mercenaries who are hired for a job, but surprise! There's now more at stake as there's a completely thrown in (only for the sake of having the clichéd) love interest, one of their own that might be betraying them (oh, drat!) and the target might be harder than they anticipated: An Evil Drug Lord – oh, no! – who controls both his island's people and government.Sure, this is a throwback to the same types of movies this 100+ actor group is used to back in the 1980s, and as much as most of those are corny, stereotypical, low-rent and shallow, at least they had heart. At least they didn't lie to what they were. You knew what you were getting yourself into.Here, in The Expendables, Director Stallone yearns to make a serious movie about senior citizens kicking butt by adding male-bonding, a philosophical tattoo preacher and the importance of friendship and trust. Then he switches back to the Predator-days long gone with jungles, blood, guts, guns and not-so-snappy one-liners.Don't get me started – too late – on the cameos. I understand the big Arnold Schwarzenegger had some forest fire business in his own country of California, but his, Bruce Willis's and Sly's scenes went as well together as their ownership of Planet Hollywood restaurants. Each one was all but a head shot where you couldn't even tell they were in the same room, not to mention it lasted all but 5 minutes. I had the same problem with the movie Heat; FINALLY they got Pacino and De Niro on the same screen for, what?, 5 minutes!?! And furthermore, I hate the post-Terminating Smiling-Jack Schwarzenegger and his cornball dumbass lines. Even the ones thrown at him were so foreseen, they weren't funny.The rest of the walk-ons, including the washed-up-before-Wrestler-and-back-to-third-rate-following, Rourke, were just happy to be employed. I guess the recession runs deeper than they thought – back to the 80s! Despite my one star review, there were two good scenes, I'll admit: Christmas, wait – wow, really Stallone? That's the best you can come up with for an ACTION star's name? Hope you didn't take that from Dr. Christmas Jones from The World is Not Enough. Anyways, Tough Christmas takes on thugs on a basketball court due to one of the failed side plots involving his love interest. I always like seeing Statham fight, despite the poor quality of the film he's in. Also, the climax is quite unbelievable, of course, but you cant rate that down for the movie it is. I will say, though, before the 700 explosions in the finale, there was a little cave fight scene that ended with machine gun/human slicing excitement. Literally, I was dozing off until that happened – multiple and honestly well choreographed fighters took on the enemy.Those two scenes by FAR could not save the rest of this crap. I'd say maaaaybe rent it for the aforementioned scenes and the testosterone finale – at least you can select those chapters and not be hopelessly stuck in the theater. Even when Stallone was bad in his career, he never stooped this low. SKIP!",1,81,137,21 August 2010
Pan's Labyrinth," Panned Viewership be Damned!
","Pan's Labyrinth eluded me for more than a decade now and now, I realize I've lived in a darker fantasy world without it.What an incredible and sobering fairy tale that I originally pegged as based solely on FX and creative designs. Oh, no, it's much more than meets the eyesto the hands.In a disgustingly horrible Captain's household in 1944, a mother and daughter suffer right alongside the rebellion and a fantasy world of objectives in order to survive and fulfill destinies.Really, that's all I'm giving. Tricky, my synopsis is as you really should appreciate this all on your own as there's more story here to fill two franchises. This is truly a must see.And forget waiting as long as I did. Put up your hands and watch it now. ***Final thoughts: While this movie can be analyzed to death, theorized to end friendships and studied in the best of film schools, I wrote one of my shortest reviews to date. I don't really have much more to say than I LOVED it, it was visually stunning and it should be viewed by all movie lovers and those adults trying to recapture their inner childhood innocence while understanding the connections to the world we, sadly, created.",10,1,1,11 November 2017
Final Destination 2," Death on the Highway
","In one of the best openings, or scenes I've watched, Final Destination 2 takes the lead immediately. Typically, this is where I generally say: 'And then it went south from there' or 'It got progressively worse.'Thankfully, noit didn't. For horror franchise fans, this was comparably to how Scream 1 and 2 panned out, in regards to quality, intelligence, surprises, keeping it fresh and making a film as equal, if not superior to the original.There's a new girl in town, and she's lookingat Death. Kimberly's (Cook) about to start a fun weekend with her clichéd friends when all-of-a-sudden (not really, if you've seen part 1) she has a vision of a massive pileup on the forthcoming highway killing her and scores of others. When she comes to, she blocks the cars behind her from entering the highway and this draws attention of police officer Thomas (Landes, one-time Jimmy Olsen).As stated/spoiled by mentioning the series original film, the crash does take place, though there are several 'survivors' thanks to Kimberly's quick thinking. While they're a bit and reasonably shaken up, Kimberly puts the pieces together knowing that this exact thing happened one year prior.And again, as the 'survivors' die in incredibly new and creative ways, the new cast uses the old to help through this mess: Clear Rivers (Larter) and Bludworth (Todd.)I'm really making this out to be a rehash, and for the most part it is. But, the 'new' explanation/revolution is not only thoroughly thought out, but kept the series (ONLY TO THIS SEQUEL) fresh and inventive. Also, Larter up'd the ante, much like what Linda Hamilton did for Sarah Connor in Terminator 2: Judgment Day. So it was nice to not only see her again, but see how much she's grown as an actress by this point.I've said it before, in regards to Part One, the rest of the case did what was required of them and the movie was well-made and highly creative, though – again – hokey at times. It's recommended to make it a double feature with the first one, even though it even works as a stand-alone film. And finally, as I mentioned, the extremely detailed opening wreck scene is worth the entire viewing.",8,3,4,19 February 2011
Blade II," Marvel Presents: Hellboy VS Blade
","It's definitively a rarity: seldom sequels top their originals. 'Blade II' is one of the exceptions. I admit, I'm not one for 'origin' stories as they normally take too long to get to what we came for, and the original 'Blade' is also an exception: it didn't take too long and was thoroughly enjoyable. However, any problems with #1 (bad, very bad, CGI, Blade acting amateurish) are gone and they move (fast) forward with a very good story and action. An already-established Vampire Mix-breed Hunter, Blade, is given the opportunity to team with his nemesis, the vampires, when a new advanced-model Vampire enters the ranks. Their (or his, to begin) mission: destroy all vampires and then supposedly wipe out humans, following. Blade's no dummy, so he's taking all precautions after rescuing his mentor, Whistler, teaming with him and newbie, Scud. It's an extremely interesting concept to the relatively new series and though it mostly plays as a 'mystery,' it's pretty easy to figure out from the get-go on how this will play out. Nevertheless, it's fun if you just sit back and enjoy, if blood-thirsty vampire action's your idea of entertainment. Pending you watched this when it first came out, it might be more original, but after the success of 'Hellboy' (also starring Perlman,) 'Aliens' (boy, it had a lot in common with Cameron's film) and any of the 'Underworld' movies, it's hard to see this original as it was in 2002. It was, despite some obvious 'plot-twists' and some silliness – slooooow-mo scenes can be annoying at times and watch how interesting sunglasses can be. Regardless, sit back, root for the male-vampire slayer as it has a little bit of everything for an action, horror, comedy and adventure person to enjoy.",8,1,6,2 November 2009
Alien," I Was Four ThenThis was Truly Alien to Me
","OkayI admit itI'm not a huge Alien fan. Well, of the aliens, yesjust not the 1979 Ridley Scott movie: Alien (#1 of 4, so far.)This is how it went down: When I was a kid, I watched all and any horror I could get my hands on. Of course, mostly with the permission from my parents who wouldn't even let me watch Gremlins. Somehow Alien got past me and I must've watched the (far superior, I wouldn't know until much later) sequel Aliens a dozen or 50 times. So, I was kinda used to that one and loved the action and the multiple aliens.See? That was the problem. You sincerely backtrack by watching #2 first followed by the original. The movie is oneoftheslowestmovingpictures I've ever seen. And it only contained ONE alien (not counting the face-hugger or the eggs) that's only shown after a good hour or more passes AND then in only bursts of screen time.When you're a kid, this is un-scary and thoroughly unacceptable. Hence, I didn't care for it back then. What happens when you're an adult, as I am now? Yeah, same. I was unfrightened and bored for the most part.Lucky for the movie, the only real bad thing I observed was the pacing. The 'one alien' concept, I accept, was necessary to show how threatening these things were. But also, in 1979 with budgets and such, I'm sure it was also the only thing they could do. (Thanks, James, for the sequel and confidence.)But, by God, the pacingtick tock. I'm shocked this wasn't directed by Michael Mann (Heat, The Insider, and Manhunter,) one of my least favorite directors for his inch-by-inch/minutes feel like hours story telling.Okay, I'll give it to the adults (it is rated R, so I assume – ha – that no one under 17 was admitted) in 1979 that this idea, though not entirely fresh – alien attacks were a 1950s staple duh, might have scared some people because, quite possibly, it was the first hard R gorefest involving an (not illegal, but space) alien with a budget.Also, the movie had excellent acting and rich characters with depth – I've been told, though not confirmed, that the cast didn't care for each other, but you wouldn't tell that here, an excellent score, gorgeous cinematography, fantastic sets and designs and introduced two of the best characters in cinema history: Ellen Ripley (Weaver) and of course the never-ending/hard-to-kill Alien.Up to the point of those last few praises, you'd think I hated the movie. Well, no, but it's nothing I ever want to revisit. I can appreciate all those wonderful qualities, plus, again, I loved the character of Ripley and the idea of the alienbut I can enjoy myself tenfold in the follow-up, Aliens.A quick rundown of the synopsis: hard working/middle class space miners are returning to Earth from deep space when 'Mother,' their ship's version of Hal 9000 or 'Computer' (on the USS Enterprise, the NCC 1701 version, not the one where porn's shown freely) intercepts a 'distress' call and commands the ship to investigate. The crew's awaken from their cryogenic sleep and are unhappy.Well, they will be soon when one is 'impregnated' from a soft alien scorpion. (VERY) soon the full blown alien bursts, literally, onto the scene and it's up to the unprepared passengers to fight off the unwanted guest. Actually, they're more like cattle, until the unlikeliest (in 1979, that is) hero(ine) emerges, warding off both machine, man and beast. Talk about a bad wake up call.Again, the movie is very well crafted – this did elevate the same ole 'alien' story with great special effects and we have to thank both Director Scott and Sigourney Weaver for creating such an awesome character in Ripley. But, get a Mountain Dew before watching or have the patience of a hungry tortoise who's a mile from food to get through to the end. Better yet, pop in Aliens. They'll give you the run down on this entire movie in a just a few brief minutes and then you can enjoy all the action, drive and horror the aliens can really produce.",7,1,1,18 January 2011
Horrible Bosses," 9 2 5 2
","There's a Red-Band trailer for Horrible Bosses. Heed my warning: do NOT watch that prior to seeing this movie. And though the original 'green' preview gives away just enough to get you into a seat, the Red-Band, which, by the way, is thee most rated R trailer I've ever seen, gives away at least 80% of the 'surprises.'Sorry, had to get that out first. And although a LOT of Horrible Bosses is predictable, it's still more fun to see the cameos and plot twists firsthand during the feature.What I'd like to also get out of the way was the 'horrible' missed opportunity they had hereto show realistically horrible bosses. Sure, these might mirror some supervisors, but they were so chock-full of clichés, that it took a lot away from what I actually wanted to relate to prior to going to see this. Also, a lot here from these three male leads, Jason Bateman as Nick, Charlie Day as Dale and Jason Sudeikis as Kurt, has already been done in Nine to Five, albeit from female leads.The comparisons are obvious between the movies, down to a comedy about employees fantasying about killing their boss, while drinking alcohol and using drugseven with rat poison. And though I laughed hard in spots here, in Horrible Bosses, I could more easily relate to Dabney Coleman's evil boss than any of the three here. Also, Nine to Five was a whole lot funnier and still holds up well today.I digress; Horrible Bosses was still a lot of fun, thanks to all three leads, and especially Kevin Spacey – the biggest asshole of the film. I believe, despite my review here, this movie can and probably will grow on me with multiple viewings, of which I'm not opposed to.So, what we have here is hard-working, but shut-out Nick vs. his boss, the greedy, selfish, profane and jealous Dave (Spacey.) The innocent, Zach Galifianakis-stand-in Dale vs. his sexually active and abusive superior, Julia (Jennifer Aniston.) And finally, Happy-To-Clock-In Kurt vs. his friend/former boss's son, the stereotypical male-doofus new boss: Bobby (Colin Farrell.)Again, like Nine to Five, Nick, Dale and Kurt plot the deaths of their nemesis's over alcohol and sometimes drugs. But, from the planning stages to the, uh, execution?, it's hilarious, despite a somewhat silly, cop-out and easy conclusion.They tell me that this is VERY HARD R, and yeah, it's extremely raunchy at times, but I've seen worse. It's not for kids, but not just for that reason – a lot of this has to go over their heads, though the teen boys might want to 'almost' see Jennifer Anniston's breasts.Definitely a recommend.",9,1,2,9 July 2011
Horrible Bosses," 9 2 5 2
","Horrible First Review...HORRIBLE BOSSES (Revisited for Labor Day 2019.) I guess I wasn't high enough back on the day after release: 7/6/11. Well, technically, I'm not high now, but I thoroughly enjoyed this comedy 10x more than before.Technically? Literally.Anyways, it's probably because I now watched the uncut version or because I appreciated the humor after spending another 8 more years in an office setting. I had a freaking ball. Laughing out loud so many times, I had to keep rewinding it. Couldn't do that in theatres in 2011.Funny thing. My own boss asked me what I was planning this weekend. I told the truth: I wanted to re-watch for the 2nd time: Horrible Bosses both for Labor Day 2019 and to finally see the sequel for the first time. Then I spent the next couple of minutes explaining *I* didn't have a horrible boss to my boss. It...I...was a mess.At least I don't wanna kill her. Or have been raked over for a promotion from her, or manipulated by her skeevy son - IF she has one! or even sexually harassed by her.All the while during this revisit almost a decade later, I kept thinking: The Hangover, another one of my favorite comedies. This would be the best double-feature with that film. That is, if Horrible Bosses 2 isn't that great coming up next.*** Final thoughts: Here's my original review from 7/9/11:9 2 5 2There's a Red-Band trailer for Horrible Bosses.

The Town," Get Outta Town
","Get Outta Town Let me start withI wasn't a big fan of The Departed, and I liked American Gangster a whole lot less. Both seemed to try and grab the Oscar, and hard, e.g. trying too desperately. Granted, Departed won it (thanks Jack) but I generally don't favor movie's only motive is for awards. (Or actors, such as Denzel Washington.)That all said, I'm not sure The Town was set out to grab any awards, though I'm sure with 100 best picture nominations (okay, 10, but still) it's sure to get a nod. That's not saying too much since 2010 basically sucked and I would be racking my brain to come up with 10, let alone 100.And yet, The Town SHOULDN'T win anything. In fact, the only nominations I would approve (but not win, mind you) would be: Best Cinematography and Best Supporting Actor for the always impressive Jeremy Renner. The rest of the cast, or talent, barely would pass an audition, let alone get any consideration.The worst part of the movie was the over-used and well-done tired plot, including the infamous LIE subplot involving the laughable Ben Affleck and his honey, Rebecca Hall. The story, co-written by the lesser Affleck (Casey is just so much better) isn't anything new and brought little to the table.OK, so we have ho-hum and very little depth bank robbers who wear disguises and/or forget to shave – shocking trickery! – who pull off their latest but must take (and eventually release) the manager, Claire (Hall) and in their suspicion, lead robber, Doug (Affleck) follows her once the 'heat' is over. Naturally and completely unsurprisingly, he falls for her.I'll pause a momenthere's where I prove how bad Affleck was in both acting and (co-)writing: he asks her a dozen or more questions on what she remembers or who's been talking to her. Maybe I'm being cynical, but she's pretty dumb, naïve, scared or just a plain idiot not to see why he's asking so many questions.Fine, not everyone can put two'n'two together, but you'll have to get ahead of that plot hole to move on to the others.The FBI knows whodunit, but they need to prove it or get a witness tonail them! Sorry, needed to put emphasis on that, because the movie asks, er, begs, you to have some urgency even though we know everyone's on the same page. Oh, and when Doug's being interrogated, let me say this: He ain't Keyser Söze. Hell, he ain't even the Joker. It would be more interesting to see the interrogation scene from Marathon Man, and if only I could play the dentist hovering over Affleck asking 'Do you think you're safe?'Let's move on to the other obvious and clichéd plot of DougieBoy wanting to do his 'last robbery' and start fresh inin Florida? Anyways, if they brought anything to the table that hasn't been done before in the countless 'I'm getting too old for this sh|t' retirement bits (SEE: Lethal Weapon One, Two, Three), I might have given a sh|t myself.I'm not going to spoil anything else, but to say: they try to unsuccessfully sneak some character depth to the story (The FBI agent that won't give up!, The Mother & Child who also want out!, The Mob won't let him go!) The positives about the film was, again, Renner, who wasn't on top of his game – nowhere near, but still good to watch and the striking, though formulaic views of Boston. Honestly, I don't mind scenic aerial shots of cities, or on the ground and in unfamiliar neighborhoods of cities. So, I did like how the film was shot.Unfortunately, it was always ended with a close up of the Dudley-Do-Wrong mug of Affleck. Buzz kill.You have no one to root for. No depth of the characters other than what's spoken and not shown. You have nothing new under the Boston sun. And you have no reason to subject yourself with dozens of other already made, already better film versions of The Town. SKIP!",3,20,39,12 December 2010
Underworld Awakening," Vengeance Returns is Right
","I am NOT one who will walk out of the theatre and proclaim this sequel is the best one of the series simply because it's the freshest in my mind. Despite on how long it's been, I always remember how I rank franchise entries and I always remember 'The Classics' – generally, but not always, the first chapter.That said, I did that with 'Underworld: Awakening.' (8/10 Stars) I walked out at the end and exclaimed: This was the best of the series.Sure, it helps that I'm not a fan of the Underworld films and that I pretty much only love both the character of Selene and the acting of Kate Beckinsale in the role. But, beyond that, this movie brought to the table a few things that made it better than the previous installments, such as no more 'ancients' story lines, more action and no more Viktor! In addition, the action was intense, the vengeance in Selene was real, raw and fun to watch and had one of the best climatic final battles in my recent memory. (Even the great 'Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol' reached its peak in the center of that film.)Did I mention, along with some pretty good lines ('I'm counting on it') and a very nice take on Selene's machine gun escape route, it's a swift and needed 88 minutes? After the film's original way-too-long 121 minutes, the series has progressively gotten shorter. I will NOT complain about this; the story and sometimes unintentionally humorous werewolf CGI cannot sustain more than a buck and a half of screen time.Now the movie's not perfect, mind you. Story, eh. Predictable, yep. And the 3-D was anything but worth it. In fact, this would be high on the list of 3-D-haters who complain it's only added to make a tad bit more in revenues.On the same note, however, the IMAX was welcomed. Its sound was deafening – in a good way, and the grand scale was nice. I don't think you can have one without the other, so we should (ah-hem) suck it up and pay the extra just to see the fighting vampires on IMAX.Selene returns (Thank you, Kate!) and with a cold-hearted (or is that broken?) vengeance. After the world's now aware of vamps and werewolves and we promptly swept the cities to get rid of them, Selene's captured and frozen only to be awakened 12 years later. Still cold blooded – ha – she's p*ssed and NO ONE will stand in her way. In fact, she's SuperSelene, a big improvement on the already ass-kicking character.I don't want to give away any of the film's 'secrets' – though most will see them coming anyways, but suffice to say, she's on a mission and it's almost non-stop action until the fantastic 3-4-way fight out in the conclusion.Okay, I'll give one awayconsider it a present to open on Christmas Eve: The actual ending, i.e. the last 30 seconds might as well had the world famous 'To Be Continued' stream across the screen like from the 'Back to the Future' final shot. Me: REALLY? (For horror fans, this was also so incredibly integrated with the 'Halloween' franchise. Repeatedly to the point of why even bother when no sequel's guaranteed.)Eh, get past that and see the movie. Even if you're not an 'Underworld' fan.",8,5,14,21 January 2012
Suicide Squad," I Now Have Suicidal Tendencies. Thanks.
","Many years ago, the characters, Jack and Karen, from TV's Will & Grace, jokingly agreed with audiences (including me) that the show should've been about them. THIS movie should've just been about Joker and Harley. Those two in a movie filled with lifeless, useless and boring characters *almost* serves as a recommendation. But, when all you have is two wonderful villains in a sea of misfires that should've been at least cool, it's too much of a letdown film to spread good word-of-mouth.And the lack of a fun time you would've had with a bunch of misfits gone good is nothing in comparison to how bad the script was. The whole movie was so far all over the place, it always felt like there was another movie with an extra hour of footage that was cut out making the overall picture a completely incomprehensible mess. Suicide Squad's own premise makes no sense whatsoever, just to begin with. After (too) many flashbacks and backstories that also continue throughout the film, a plan is hatched to use the vilest baddies to, um, uh, I guess help keep people safe? All-but midstream of the planning stages, a mission so convoluted gets the 'we won't sign on' team ready to go fightwhatever.In one of the many subplots, a slave to the 'good-guys' causes Man of Steel-sized havoc in a downtown city. Superheroes are mentioned, used and are actively fighting crime, and yet Never was there a thought of asking for help, nor did the actual righteous heroes even notice the city under attack or hundreds dying. Yeah, this is the same argument in the Marvel Universe, such as: In Thor's movies, where's Iron Man when he's totally needed. That's a huge hole in both Marvel and DC Universe films and I guess they just ask us to accept it. Whatever.The movie had pretty subpar special effects and nothing to view on the big screen. The actors kept trying to give emotional speeches but always strayed away from their character build-ups. And the plot holes and editing was so shoddy, it lead me to believe this wasn't the movie we were supposed to see.Again, that all said, man did I like Harley and this version of Joker. I've heard complaints about Jared Leto's take and I didn't have one problem with it. I've seen so many incarnations of him, I'm used to new visions of 'J.' From Cesar Romero's to Jack Nicholson's to my person favorite, Heath Ledger's, The Joker has many faces and motivations. So, I was cool with him.Overall, with Joker and the absolutely fabulous Harley Quinn, the movie barely squeaks to a star over the lowest rating. MAYBE, you can watch this at home, for free, like on Netflix or a free Redbox rental, but only to see them. Everything else is incidental. And bad.***Final thoughts: Shame on you DC. Sadly, there's a post-credit scene (NOT A FAN) and it's a hundred percent rip-off of the Marvel film's post- credit scenes. Almost verbatim. Not to mention, it's something we already know about, so it was pointless. IF you see this movie, you can stay through the first part of the end credits to see this, but be warned: It's just melted icing on an already spoiled cake.",2,4,8,6 August 2016
Elf," Put This Elf on Your Movie Shelf
","Wow. Will doesn't have to be crude, addicted to sports or streaking naked to entertain the masses.What a lovely and non-threatening holiday classic. Pretty darn funny in some spots, warm in others and the suspension of disbelief is fairly easy for the most part. (I mean, exceptHe's still human, right? Wouldn't he freeze in that outfit? I digress)I've only seen this once before – many years ago and remember liking it, but since I've heard so many people call it their favorite, I had to revisit this Christmas Eve 2015. Not sorry I did and will now continue to cherish it many more times. Kinda reminded me a ton of another one of my all-time favorite comedies, Liar Liar, this movie about an adopted kid/elf seeking out his stereotypical bad movie dad and showing true positivity in an otherwise cross New York City is perfect for the whole family. And every once in a while, it's nice to have something that's both great for kids, but also enjoyable to adultswithout being a Pixar animated movie. ***Final thoughts: You may have been right about the half star, Chris, but forgot about the four full ones before it. See? My heart's not always three sizes too small! (Oops, wrong movie)",9,3,4,25 December 2015
Taxi Driver," (Just) Take Me Home Tonight
","Finally, I saw the 'You Talking' To Me' movie.Was I impressed? Did I need to see it back in 1976 (uh, when I was two) to appreciate it? I think I just answered the first question.Taxi Driver was so random and bland and yet, it was watchable. It wasn't the startling film I expected. It wasn't the dark, deep and moving picture I imagined. Perhaps, yeah, I would have needed to see it back in the 1970s to understand where it was coming from because it sure as Hades didn't hold up for me in today's standards.Travis Bickle is not fickle about structure and what both New York City and women should be. So, with his insomnia, he opts to drive a taxi and stalk a woman who's volunteering to aid the 'next' President of the United States. When that doesn't work out, why not try and rescue a preteen prostitute he's seen a few times?Let's throw in some odd friends, a guns purchase, politics, a rescue and revenge. Suffice to say, this movie, while extremely well directed and Jodie Foster does a decent job, is so incredibly random aside from the fact that Bickle's not getting better. He's getting worse and watch out.Supposedly, he's a hero, but I'm not sure who would ever call him one in today's times. Perhaps 37 years ago, ignorance would proclaim him one. Such unaware times.For original fans only.",4,3,8,6 January 2013
Shutter Island," Passenger 67
","Ah, yet another collaboration between Scorsese and DiCaprio. You would think they were father and son, by now. But, is Shutter Island one of their best? Well, since I've never seen Gangs of New York (yet,) I can't honestly say. But, I will say it was much better than The Aviator and The Departed, despite the fact I'm certain to get backlash on that comment. (For the record, I thought Aviator and Departed were good, but I enjoyed Shutter much more.) Was it great? By no means, but it was interesting and visually stimulating. So much so, I do hope for a Best Cinematography Oscar nom next year. And though predictable – the ads gave away too much, but even without the trailers, you would still know who 'number 67' is – it's still a fun ride through to the end.Federal Marshall Daniels (DiCaprio) meets with fellow new-partner Aule (Ruffalo) on a boat, and what I saw as a spoof/joke against Titanic, Daniels is seasick and doesn't like boat rides. They land on 'Shutter Island' to investigate the 'magical' disappearance of inmate/patient/criminal Rachel, only Daniels has his own ulterior motives revealed throughout the film on accepting/requesting this particular assignment.The movie plays out as a film noir mystery, set in the 1950s. Many of the sets, locales and moods are very 1950s in both setting and film-making. It's almost as if Scorsese acted out his Tarantino-like impulses and made homage to film noir past. And, believe it, it worked.Though, again, the average moviegoer will see where there people fit into place in the 'mystery,' the movie didn't bog you down on the 'big M. Night Shyamalan' secret. They had a serious detective story to show with believable acting, great scenery, buildings and dialogue.My only problems with the film were minute. Easily 20-30 minutes could've been cut. Sure, a lot, if not most, scenes were necessary to advance the plot, yet a good majority of them were drawn completely out to the max. Also, most of the movie did not have a score, but when it did, it was too loud and overbearing – for example: the camera follows both Daniels and Aule, amongst others, into the asylum for the first time, and the score was so incredibly deafening, it was distracting. And finally, I have not seen this many flashbacks since ALL of the Saw films (combined) or as many nightmares as the Freddy Kruger films. No doubt they were integral to the plot, but, BOY, every few seconds you had to do a double take on what reality – nightmare, memory, foreshadow – you were witnessing.That all said, I would still recommend this movie. Thankfully, Leo didn't overact (AS MUCH, that is) like he does in 90% of his movies. Most of his features, you can see him yearning to win an Oscar, much like what Denzel Washington does in the majority of his movies. He did a good job. All three other main characters, played by Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow, were not only believable, but did a great job.I don't see this as a 100% repeat-viewer, but you should still see Shutter Island. At very least, take in the sights.",8,1,4,21 February 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Shield Me Some More
","Why can't Iron Man, Thor or Hulk be more like the Cap?Growing up, Captain America was so uninteresting to me, I barely looked at his covers as I collected and read dozens of other comics weekly. It wasn't until his 'First Avenger' movie – which I had previously dreaded and waited to see – did I become a huge fan. That movie was fantastic and oodles better than Tony Stark's second and third films as well as both Thor movies.And so is Cap's follow-up 'stand-alone' adventure: Captain America: The Winter Soldier.I truly liked this movie and strongly believe it will improve with each viewing. It was a much more adult comic book movie, but not overly serious, like the Dark Knight trilogy or Man of Steel. It also knew how to handle multiple agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. efficiently. (A lesson learned in The Avengers but lost on most comic book movies, i.e. Spider-Man 3 and the original Batman sequels.)The Captain continues to doubt anyone as patriotic and heroic as himself in this chapter, and with good reason. The age-old 'trust no one,' though annoying and overused, is this movie's tagline, or should be. But, with the help of his friends, the so-called 'mystery' is unraveled and Cap, (a personal favorite) Black Widow and a new-comer agent fight all over the place, but mostly in (and above) the D.C./East Coast areas.I'm totally not giving away the synopsis as I normally would, but not to avoid spoilers. This movie isn't plot-heavy, and most of its been done before many, many times, so there's really not much to give away here and you can, and should, just sit back and enjoy the inside jokes, the sometime surprises, the other Marvel mentions, the action and the sly winks at the audience. I.E. make sure you read what's on a character's tombstone at the end of the movie.Definitely a high recommendation for this film: Great action, depth of the characters, another shot to see Black Widow in pretty much the whole movie, more great lines and action from Chris Evans's fantastic portrayal as the Cap and, of course, the never-ending and wonderful Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury (and attitude.)* * * Final thoughts: DO NOT wait to see the final TWO Marvel spots during the credits. But, if you do – again, don't, they're really blah – look for all the 'Steve/Steven/Stephen/Stephan's in the credits. Either I must be truly popular, it's homage to Steve Rogers or just an amazing coincidence. Yeah, probably the third one.",8,0,1,5 April 2014
Life of Pi," Richard and Pi's Excellent Adventure
","Life of Pi, it turns out, isn't about that tasty dessert or a boring series of numberseven though they do list them out in one fairly decent scene.Actually, this movie has multiples of great scenes. Namely the enormously gorgeous cinematography. Ang Lee is known for that, or at least, used to be in such excellent films: Brokeback Mountain, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, The Wedding Banquet and yeah, even Hulk – but that was the only real attribute to that film.The dialogue was great, the acting too. The originality was refreshing and I loved all performances. You would never know in an Ang Lee film (well, skipping Hulk) if actors are trained prior and are amateurs, or professionals. Not only does he have a great eye, he knows how to lead.Boy Pi recounts his life journeys to a novelist and it's an amazing adventure, mostly on a lifeboat following a ship wreck to a new land from India. On said boat, he shares the ride with a hungry tiger and incredibly survives (I did say he's telling his back story in present time, so no, that's not a spoiler.)That's the basic premise, even though there's a lot more to the story.To me, the real beauty was in the filmmaking, the breathtaking out-to-sea scenes and the actor's, Suraj Sharma (Pi,) excellent ability to carry the majority of the movie on rough seas. I'd probably die within days, or kill the so wonderfully named tiger: Richard Parker, for food. Sorry, (big) cat lovers out there.The movie did not have great marketing, and maybe that's because they didn't know how to show this adventure in a few quick minutes of screen time. Nevertheless, it's highly recommended, and if you get a chance to see it on the big screen, you better.Side Note: Richard Parker, the furious tiger, actually made me take a second look at the house cat at my residence. 'Don't get any ideas, hungry one,' I would say through my eyes the very next time I saw the house cat following watching this.",8,0,2,21 January 2013
Ocean's Thirteen," Thirteen's a Charm
","I feel like a broken record, but I need to say it again: Ocean's Thirteen is the Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade make-up film (to Temple of Doom.) Now, I am actually an unapologetic supporter of Ocean's Twelve, but I truly and really liked this chapter.Does it match the original's originality, even though that was a remake? No, but it comes pretty damn close. Andthey made it back to Vegas, where they belong.The gang gathers around a fallen and deceived member and comes up with a brilliant and often hilarious plot to thwart the great Al Pacino.Literally, that's the plot. Now, I don't mean to downplay itI had an absolute blast here, but also admired this movie tremendously.For example, the graphics and locations were amazing. I'm a stickler for 'getting Vegas right.' Con Air had the strip all over the place, including casinos/hotels that didn't even exist when the movie premiered. The movie 21 had 'our heroes' stay in the Green Valley Ranch that had a convenient view of the strip, even though the strip is miles away. In Ocean's Thirteen, there was a fake casino erected, and the location they gave, it made sense. Even the views from the place and hotel rooms was accurate – had this place existed.The comedy was back, the tension and fun was relevant and the suspense was key. If you loved 2001's Ocean's Eleven and that does happen to be one of my all-time favorite movies, you should truly love this. (Yeah, it helps if you saw Part 'Twelve,' but not 100% necessary.)",9,4,5,2 September 2013
Lost in Translation," Whispering Heights
","I admit, I had just finished a relationship, got fired – sort of and had one helluva time with some emotional/financial moments back in late 2003, so it wasn't too hard to attach myself onto one of the most emotionally charged films of all time: Lost in Translation.Maybe that just opened my eyes and helped me both understand and appreciate the beauty of this masterpiece. It hit all the right moments: from loneliness, to isolation, to comedy, to heart. And all the stars were aligned with the only two actors who could pull off the emotion and the brilliant script as well as direction by Sofia Coppola. The movie's not just centered on washed up actor, Bob Harris (Murray,) but he had to hit every note perfectly. Mission accomplished.Unfortunately for Mr. Murray, he is the owner of the biggest upset in Oscar history. He lost out on his one Oscar chance for Best Actor, as not only was this the best performance of the year, one of the best ever, it was also his best acting in his long-standing career. (Brokeback Mountain losing Best Picture in 2005 was the second worst Oscar upset next to this, probably because due to the ignorant and homophobic voters, it was almost expected.)This is not to take away from Scarlett Johansson. This is where I first noticed here and absolutely fell in love. She was ideal and perfect in her role as well. You felt every bit of her anguish and her character, Charlotte's youth versus Bob's experience. She concluded the circle between them: if things don't change, you'll go from A (Charlotte) to B (Bob.)Bob's been summoned to Tokyo to film a whiskey commercial. He doesn't want to, but he probably doesn't know why he accepted the offer – it doesn't appear he likes to make too many choices. He's just tired. So tired. And we're not talking about insomnia, though, that's on the horizon. In fact, what starts as jet lag ends as a long week of sleeplessness.You know who also can't sleep? The somewhat equally lost Charlotte, who's staying in the same hotel with her new busy, busy husband. She doesn't know why she married him, but she knows she does love him. She is lost, and it's not so much that he's the problem, but he is the target.Eventually the two meet and form a bond that both need, to get through a week-long bit of despair. They are truly lost in translation, and are sincerely spiraling out of focus.During their encounters, or even alone, the script manages to throw in a bunch of comedic moments, mostly from Bill Murray. It's a perfect blend of humor and tragic drama.I know, if something doesn't change in my life soon, I will end up like Bob Harris. I can see that. He's wildly sarcastic, but I don't think he's trying to be mean. He's just tired, bored and he's finding both humor in his surroundings and he's trying to amuse himself, as if he truly is all alone. Some people don't necessarily find me funny, and that never bothers me when I spout out my own brand of humor. 90% of the time, I'm doing it, just like Bob Harris, to simply amuse myself and relieve the boredom of life around me.Some might be put off by the pacing of the film, but I loved it. It gave us every bit of a chance to walk in these people's troubled lives, not to mention the fun they were having – but probably wouldn't admit it. I loved the score, the music – 'Just Like Honey' by The Jesus & Mary Chain is one of my all time favorites following this and Bill rejuvenated the song 'More than This' by 10,000 Maniacs (I didn't grow up on the Roxy Music version) for me.Furthermore, the cinematography and landscaping, yes, even in the hotel rooms, was wonderful. I've never been to Japan, but this makes me feel like I have.The lines, like the messages, in the movie are vast and deep. I had to watch it a few times to absorb everything and then more on DVD just to really get into Bob's bantering. The two leads are just beautiful together and they are written so well, that Coppola broke all sorts of clichés and made the movie real.The part all viewers are expecting, including myself, didn't come. I truly believed it had to happen as all these types of movies have that (no I won't mention what that is, but it's not hard to figure out when you're watching it) and honestly, I was so enthralled in the story, so captivated and wrapped in the film, I wouldn't have minded a cliché or two.Instead we are left with a secret. A whisper. And though none of us will find out what was silently passed on, I loved it.This movie is a work of art, through and through. If you have not experienced it, you are hereby ordered to take place in how movies should be made.",10,8,11,22 August 2010
Doctor Strange," Inception Begins
","'Wake up, Bruce. You're not in a dream of a dream of a dream. You are The One' Okay, not an actual quote from this movie, but since this is basically 50/50 Batman Begins and Inception, it might as well be. Dr. Strange is just that, but as the movie progresses, mercifully, things made more sense. Though, unfortunately, what makes it better is what takes away from itit's just too damn long. As mentioned, it's 50% Batman Begins, only the scenes for him to become the Marvel® character he is unknown for, felt like the first Christopher Nolan/Bruce Wayne film stretched to two movies.And speaking of Christopher Nolan, how did he not direct this? If the movie's not the Doctor learning his new powers, it's the entire city altering scenes from Inception. The only thing missing was that loud, pounding score.I digress. The movie is actually pretty good, thanks to some humor, actors who were perfect for their roles and seamless CGI that never once looked fake. Well done, guys. Additionally, the story is fairly good, dialogue acceptable and the movie knew when enough was enough with whatever landscaped special effects exposition was happening.Basically, the Doctor whono one's heard of mirrors Dr. House after an accident and seeks out non-Asian Tilda Swinton to teach him the ways of infinity and beyond. Naturally, there has to be a threat and Batman, er, Strange must learn to rid his shortcomings to end the movie as if he was in a Thor spin off. I saw some young kids in the audience during my screening. Bad choice. Not that this is an adult comic book movie, à la Deadpool, even though it has more swearing than most I've seen. It's just a ton of talking, adult themed problems and little to relate to the little ones. Sure there are many spectacular visuals, some dumbed down humor and the Marvel® name attached to it, but I can't see this being understood for anyone under probably 10-11 years of age. As much as I enjoyed this, my problem with these kinds of movies/characters with almost infinite power, is where do you go from here? While the movie was wrapping up, I kept thinking of all the other Marvel® movie's climaxes that could've been solved in seconds with Dr. Strange's powers. Where's the fun in that? The fun of those movies is having our heroes figure out how to defeat the bad guy by using both their super powers and weaknesses. Dr. Strange merely has to all-but wave his hand and problem solved. No fun in that!Still, it's worth a watch, not in the bottom of the Marvel® Cinematic Universe, but also not in the top half.***Final thoughts: Still hate those post credit scenes, and now they usually have a minimum of two, upwards of THREE! Mercifully, they put the first one only about a minute or two into the post credits, so I stayed for that one. I have no idea what happened 10 minutes later for the second one, and frankly, I don't care. You make your movie too long, such as this one, I want out. (I will, however, find it online, or catch it on my second viewing at home. At least, I can fast-forward/skip to that last one.)",6,3,7,5 November 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Missouri Burning
","Sure, it was funny. Should've it been?Could you watch an incredibly tense and sad movie about a school shooting and wonder why they didn't add more humor to it?This movie somehow wanted to be Fargo, but so much more serious. It had the crimes - so many, MANY crimes - and yet, the guilty seemingly kept getting away with literal murder, but since it was 'justified,' it was okay.Yeah, I laughed out loud and agreed with a lot of the protagonist's monologues, but that doesn't make what we see on screen okay. Nor does it make the incredibly annoying dipshit deputies' actions okay.Basically, a broken mother's daughter is brutalized and killed which follows an inept and racist police force to do nothing. So, she takes Death Wish matters into her own hands and all-but makes a comedy out of the serious situation. This very much felt like a Coen brothers' feature, except the blend of real and slapstick did not work. I could be in near tears for the tragedies displayed or the GOTCHA! moments and instead of easing into a spoof-like comedy bit, it just hit me like a two by four. I think it would've worked so much better if it chose which movie it wanted to be: screwball comedy or serious drama.That all said, again, it was absolutely hilarious in moments and really heartbreaking in others. I guess if you wanted to see horrifying tragedies with out-of-place hilarity, this is the Best Pic Nom for you.***Final thoughts: As for the Oscars, it's a no for Best Pic from me, a BIG NO for Sam Rockwell, a maybe for Woody Harrelson and screenplay and a pretty big YES for Frances McDormand who is, by far, the best aspect of this movie.",5,10,18,1 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," And the Fall of a Saga
","Thank GOD it's over, but mercifully, and the highest praise I can give this movie: the 141 minutes, unbelievably, flew by. Unlike the previous installment that was a tad longer, but felt twice as long.I heard someone describe this movie as scene, then scene, then scene and then end. My Star Wars friend and I laughed as we pointed out that's how all movies are. Until...I saw this. And they were so incredibly right.This film is just a checklist of things needed for a Star Wars movie with a few extra bonus scenes to conclude the 9-film franchise. It did NOT feel like a comprehensive story, it did NOT have any emotion to any character dying or almost dying and it did NOT feel like a continuation of the previous films - like, for the first time, you didn't actually have to see anything prior to understand this 'plot' as a whole. (It would help, though, since there are about 50 little Easter Eggs for fans. Most pretty funny, and I did like.)So, just like that checklist, they just went from scene to scene without much flow or great editing. It actually felt more like a chore to get to the end for the filmmakers and actors who ALL seemed to have checked out by now.Let's see if I can sum up this movie in a non-spoilery synopsis, though, frankly, there's not much at all to spoil. If you can imagine what this movie is about, you're probably right. But, anyways, a dark figure emerges outta nowhere in the timeline and offers the series newest sorta bad guy, Kylo Ren, much more to defeat the good guys with since all they've ever proven over 9 movies is how inept the most powerful machines and forces are against a group made up of the tiniest of fractions of the Dark Side.So, our good guys hear this and must go from Point A to B to C to...Z to try and work things out. Bring balance, whatever.I certainly didn't hate this movie like I remember walking out of Episode VIII: The Last Jedi with such a broken heart. And previously I hated Episode VII: The Force Awakens since it was a 89% shot-by-shot remake of Episode IV: A New Hope. Since VII and VIII's releases and a few more re-watches, I'm warmed up to them a bit, though I still rank them low overall.I don't know if the same can be said here. Like I said, I didn't hate this movie - the special effects were good and the humor, namely from C3P0 and Chewie, did make me laugh out loud more than a few times. But, I really didn't like it much. The story, if there was one, was so flat and so uninspiring. I really didn't care about any of the characters here. None of them. Well, again, I liked C3P0 and Chewie for the humor they brought me, but I didn't care if they lived or died. In fact, when some characters DID pass on, extremely little time was given to grieve and the setup to their demise was almost comical, almost a last-minute add-on...and followed by a quick MOVE-ON.While it's watchable and has some great little homages to the series, it currently ranks as my all-time least favorite theatrical film in the entire series. Which is sad, because that was the exact same reaction I had when I saw both VIII and VII.Recommended? Sure. Especially since there's nothing in here to really offend and it does conclude the saga, if you're a completist. I've seen a lot worst out there, so I guess I could recommend this faster paced finale.***Final thoughts: Here's my Best to Worst Theatrical Releases of This Saga:1 Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back

Pacific Rim," ...And Yet, Still Better than Battleship
","Godzilla (1954,) King Kong vs, Godzilla (1962,) Godzilla vs, Mechagodzilla (1974,) Aliens (1986,) Robocop (1987,) Robo(t )jox (1989,) Deepstar Six (1989,) Tremors (1990,) Independence Day (1996,) Starship Troopers (1997,) Godzilla (1998,) Reign of Fire (2002,) The Matrix Revolutions (2003,) Transformers (2007,) The Mist (2007,) Cloverfield (2008,) Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009,) Monsters vs, Aliens (2009,) Avatar (2009,) Monsters (2010,) Real Steel (2011,) Super 8 (2011,) Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011,) TV's Falling Skies (2011+) and Battleship (2012.)Did I miss any? I mean, I was previously informed Pacific Rim was original, and I was like: whaaat?Granted I don't believe this movie was made to be original. It was simply, and boy was it simple, made to dazzle with great visuals and giant robots vs. giant aliens. Literally, there is nothing else of substance to this movie. The acting was subpar, the dialogue atrocious and the comedic touches werewell, never funny. Hell, I even love Charlie Day from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, but he was so hard to watch here.Don't get me wrong, there were a few clever ideas here and the visuals and special effects were literally, huh, out of this world, but I don't see or appreciate movies that are based on one single attribute. And with such lush FX and CGI – which I normally don't like, but here was great thanks to one of the best and creative directors, Guillermo del Toro, the movie did carry me and was incredibly better than some of the movies it stole from, such as Battleship or any of the Transformers disasters.Here's where I usually give the synopsis, and believe me, I'll be as brief as they were, despite the over two hour runtime: Since aliens coming from outer space is sooo passé, these aliens decided to come up from the ocean and they're huge. Seeing that they're virtually indestructible with our current weapons, Earthlings decide to build Rock 'Em Sock 'Em robots of equal size. While forced, emotionless drama and little to mostly meaningless background takes some of the screen time, the bulk of the film is fights between the good guy/bad guy giants.If I were a kid, damn I probably would've loved this; I craved Godzilla, and the like, big monster movies. Back then, I didn't care so much about drama, originality or depth, but as I got older and have seen thousands of different movies than I had as a child (see above for an incredibly short, albeit relevant taste,) I grew tired of the same ole stuff. It's not like I lost in touch with my younger self, but children need a lot less to impress them than educated adults.And after this, plus the major disappointments with Battleship, Avatar and even 1998's Godzilla, I still have faith 2014's Godzilla won't let me down. I believe it will fulfill my childhood desires, but also have some depth, real characters and more than a hint of a story. Is that too much to ask when a director is given nearly $200 million dollars that he spends more than $200 dollars on the script?* * * Final thoughts: In my first paragraph, I picked some of the most relevant movies that I've seen that I believe this mimicked or flat-out stole from. For even more big monster movies I might have missed, check out the Wikipedia page for Movie Monsters.",3,4,7,19 October 2013
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," An *ALMOST* Clone of the First
","Georgie Lucas stated, and I am doing this from memory, that he does things his way and ignores criticisms or outside influences. I doubt this is true, because he must've learned at least one lesson from the backlash after Episode I during the making of his Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones: 98% less Jar Jar Binks.Sadly, Jar Jar does make an appearance and even has a line or two, but he's extremely more tolerable this time around, as was the movie.Now, we haven't gotten to the quality and heart of the original Star Wars trilogy in this Episode (#2,) but we have improved from the last (or first) installment.Basically, little Annie Skywalker has grown a bit in both his Jedi abilities and under the belt for his 'angel,' Padmé, but beyond their horribly written and acted 'love' story, comes the building of two sides of war.If you know the story – and you should by now, it's past the time for spoilers here, it's actually a crafty story of one man controlling both sides of the war. I absolutely admired that, plus the villain who controls both as puppeteer.Sadly, there is so much that gets in the way of this being a great or even mediocre film. The purposely terrible acting and laughable dialogue by our leads does remind us that this is Georgie's world. Every time I wanted to love this or take more interest in, Georgie does all he can to bring it back to his under-toddler mind.It also didn't help that this is not only a bridge story, but all three prequels could've easily fit into one movie. Unfortunately, as the title suggests, there's got to be an I, II and III.I actually didn't hate this movie or the experience as much as I did with The Phantom Menace. There is enough good in here to praise, such as C-3PO's endless amount of comic relief, some decent special effects, fun action sequences and best of all: Yoda in action. That scene ALONE is worth the entire movie viewing.While I made a silent vow not to see this again, I would recommend for first time viewers to begin with I and drudge through until you get to the goods, or in this case: IV-VI.* * * Final thoughts: Growing up, my two favorite Star Wars characters were C-3PO and Yoda. I might take back my promise and re-watch this sometime in the future if I have another Star Wars marathon in mind. Again, despite the constant interferences of potential greatness by Georgie, there's enough to see here for a ton of fun.",4,0,4,6 April 2014
Lion," The Boy on the Train
","I'd be lion if I said I sometimes didn't obsess for years to find something or someone from my past. Though, mine seems a ton more trivial now.Talk about cultural differences. It might happen in America, but I doubt the outcome would be the same. This sometimes heartbreaking story tells the true tale of a five-year- old boy getting separated by his older brother in India. He is virtually trapped on a train car for days and the people who do see him and his cries for help lands on deaf ears. Once finally released from the cab, he's lost, taken and eventually sold (I guess) to an Australian couple. So off he's whisked to Australia, grows up and finally hit with the overwhelming need to find his first homeand mum. His two year obsession nearly destroys his adult life, relationships and adopted mother. This is a story of a lost boy grown up and attempting to retrace his steps from shaky memories now 25 years later and from when he was only five.Heck, I remember some of when I was five years old, and though I didn't have such a tragedy occur, I am uncertain if I could recall enough details to put the pieces back together. I don't even know if I even knew my parent's real names back then. Worse, for this person, he has only his memory to rely on verses any records, people or places to recall.Again, I doubt this would happen (as badly) in the United States, but according to this film, this happens, ah-hem, 80,000 times a year. Egad! They have issues.I did truly like this film and had a string of emotions throughout. Started with anger on how poorly strangers and agencies dealt with an obviously lost young child. And, mercifully, he did end up with a loving family, it still was terrible he was all-but snatched away and sold as property. But the emotional journey of him attempting to reconnect with his biological family was when the movie peaked and provided a pleasant hope. Definitely worth seeing.***Final thoughts: Unfortunately, I have little, in-person contact with foreigners and I would like to. Coincidentally to me seeing this, I get to spend some time with a friend coming from Peru for the very first time to the States. I get to take him to Vegas, Disneyland, Hollywood and a few other places within driving distance of Phoenix, AZ. Can't wait for him to visit and for me to learn more from someone outside the country in about a week. Let's just hope he doesn't board a train without me and I have to spend the next 25 years looking for him!",8,0,1,29 January 2017
Ant-Man," Scott Shrinkage
","Speaking of the ability to shrink to ground level, Marvel's done the same thing with their 'Universe.' While some aspects were fun, the acting on par and they included two of my favorite Micheals: Mr. Peña and Mr. Douglas, Ant-Man was worth a watch for MCU fansat home.So many scenes were dry and drawn out. Since the movie is A-B-C to the letter and it hardly elevated from the bottom of the MCU films, those scenes were tough to get through. I understand this is yet another origin story, but with a little more editing and much more Ant-Man himself, this could've been much more entertaining. Still, it's worth a watch on your home screen once it's available in a couple of months. That way, you can fast-forward through the incredibly long credits to see the post-post credit scene (yeah, there were two, neither worth waiting for,) and not have to be bored to tears waiting for a useless scene. (I even brought my phone out during the credits and played some games as I needlessly waited.) I hate Marvel for those scenes. Hopefully DC won't mimic them.",5,17,48,19 July 2015
21 Jump Street," Jump this Shark
","Without spoiling the movie adaption of 21 Jump Street, as I am thankful no one ruined it for me, I am pleased with one revelation towards the end.Combine that to the hilarious Nick Offerman (from the fantastic Parks & Recreation TV program) scene as our 'heroes' are reprehended by Deputy Chief Hardy and you'll have the roughly 7 minutes of 109 that I liked.OK, I don't want to be too harsh; it wasn't that bad. In fact, it felt slightly better the movie I felt it mostly mimicked, The Other Guys. That's not saying much, however.It also didn't help that they, or again, Nick Offerman as Deputy Chief Hardy, flat out tells you what to expect in the best line in the movie: 'We're reviving a canceled undercover project from the '80s and revamping it for modern times. The people behind this lack creativity and they've run out of ideas, so what they do now is just recycle sh|t from the past and hope that nobody will notice.'I'm guessing that quote tells us not to take this seriously at all. Correct. But, they still needed a lot more consistency in their direction as this movie was all over the place while never knowing what kind of movie they wanted to be. Was it drama? Comedy? Slap-stick? A love story? A teen romp?The only thing the movie and the original TV program it's based on have in common, with the exception of the title, is the little tiny bit of drama. Now, I was NOT a fan of the TV show back in the 80s, but since it was, in fact, the 1980s, we only had one TV and I watched this with my sister since she liked it. That said, I'd much rather watch a few seasons of that before I saw this again.Dumb nerd, Schmidt (Johan Hill) and dumb jock, Jenko (Channing Tatum) do not combine their talents to make one cool guy, but instead show us repeatedly on how not to be a police officer. So much so, even they would've been kicked out of the original Police Academy in the original Police Academy.They're forced to team up as undercover narcs to take down a drug ring at a high school. Along the way, they break every law in order to, uh, preserve the law. (This is the part they tell us to turn off our brains, like when they used to tell us to put on our 3-D glasses during the movie.)Sadly, my message is not getting to the right exec in Hollywood: we need shorter run times for movies like these. This 109 minute movie absolutely needed to be between 85-90 minutes, but directors don't know when enough's enough. And hence, for the majority of the second half the movie wanders around from subplot to the next with obvious conclusions.I'm not sure how this movie could've been better, aside from not being made in the first place or at least (again) better edited. Perhaps they could've stuck with the original theme and not follow the latest trend of remakes mocking the originals. I dunno, but in any case, I ain't moving down to Jump Street any time soon.",3,2,5,3 March 2013
Captain America: The First Avenger," The First and Best?
","In the summer of 2011, when it had already been announced that the following summer would be kicked off with The Avengers, I got so severely burned out on poor to mediocre superhero films, beginning with Thor and followed by X-Men: First Class, Green Lantern and finally, Captain America - The First Avenger.In all fairness, I got burned out after the X-Men prequel which I only barely liked then and would later appreciate more. On video, I would finally see Green Lantern and absolutely hate almost every minute of that. Due to that, I put off Cap't America as long as I could. As Julia Roberts' Vivian once said in Pretty Woman: 'Big mistake. Big. Huge.'ForI actually really enjoyed this movie a tonand he's completely down my list of favorite superheroes.Chris Evans brought a special heart and selfless spirit to the contagiously patriotic Steve Rogers, a.k.a. Captain America. I understand and have seen overly Gooo-America films – most recently, Act of Valor, but this one, thanks for Evans, really roped me in and I both loved and rooted for him the whole way.While I'm not a big fan of CGI, the computer generated, miniscule and original weakling Steve Rogers, before he becomes Captain America, was, in fact, weak. I understand there had to be a transition from small to super soldier, but they all-but made him look like a mouse that would later turn into a tiger. A bit too under-the-top.Nevertheless, we have a small boy who's desperately trying to fight for truth, justice and the American way in World War II and continuously gets knocked down, literally and figuratively. Untilhe gets spotted due to that deep heart I spoke about. Not just overnight, but within minutes, he's now fast, strong and regenerative. What hadn't changed was that perfect attitude.He's got the (ho-hum, and sometimes boring) Red Skull to deal with, as, I guess, Hilter's so passé. But, along the way, he's accompanied with a beautiful broad and the always awesome Tommy Lee Jones as his Colonel.Admittedly, the first half is a lot more entertaining, contains welcomed great performances and special effects/cinematography for a superhero film. Even the second half is still a fun ride with wonderful tie-ins to the other Marvel/Avenger films and an extremely touching and admirable finale.While it's not perfect, and not the genre I'm fond of – period piece films, but it's a lot of fun, and comparatively speaking, they saved the best for last in Summer 2011.",8,0,1,4 May 2013
American Hustle," Niro De Niro
","Grifters, they're not, but they bring a pretty good American Hustle to the screen.There's a good surprise to expect towards the end, but the one that surprised me most was when Robert De Niro shows up. Yeah, it's a gangster-kinda film, so, naturally, he would. But, what threw me was that Christian Bale basically portrayed a young Robert De Niro this entire film. So much so, in fact, I could never see Bale. Just De Niro.So, it was odd seeing them both on screen at the same time.Beyond that, you do have some damn good performances from the female leads. Amy Adams, whom I always see as a Muppets lead, did great here, but she was outshined by the always fantastic Jennifer Lawrence.Those two, Amy and Jennifer, actually did so well, that you nearly forget about the male leads (and their terrible wigs) in this feature.I digress. This movie, about lowlifes who get caught and have to turn tricks now for the feds is decent enough. Not great, but watchable through to the end. Sadly, it's really nothing I haven't seen before and yet, the humor, music and performances did make it watchable and interesting. I wouldn't necessarily vote it into the Best Picture noms from 2013, but you could do a lot worse.* * * Final thoughts: Jeremy Renner's always been a favorite of mine, as is Jennifer Lawrence as of late. Sadly, neither portrayed their best performances here, but still did what they could. Though it would be nice for the nominated Lawrence to pull in another Actress Oscar win, my eyes are centered in on Julia Roberts in August: Osage County.",7,2,3,18 January 2014
Top Secret!," It's really no Secret why this movie's near the Top.
","Clearly, the writers of Top Secret! didn't know what decade they were spoofing. From 1950's dances and music to M*A*S*H and Mary Tyler Moore TV references to Satellites (?),Top Secret! simply got lazy at times. After awhile, you'll simply get used to them as none of this is really supposed to be taken seriously.So, get past that, I did, and you'll have a freaking blast as the good enormously outweighs the flaws. Sure, some (make that few) of the jokes are corny, predictable and don't work (Val's head in the toilet would've been funnier animated – wait, it was, on Scooby-Dooweekly) but most will have you rolling – A new version of Frogger, Der Pinto, The Tunnel of Irony, Tic Tac Glass, just to name a very few.American sensation, Nick (Kilmer) travels to Germany just as the rebellion builds up against the Nazis around World War II. He continually saves the damsel in many dresses while singing a few tunes and dances away unscathed. His mission, he didn't really choose, is to rescue the dame's imprisoned father and Batman's butler and escape East Germany.Really, the plot doesn't matter and as slim as it is, it's actually more complicated than the highly superior Airplane! The real joy is seeing true slapstick as it was meant to be, unlike the failed attempts of recent years. And yes, they can make a spoof without Leslie Nielsen, though he's a big part of why most of them worked in the 1970's and 1980's.The movie starts off with a bang telling you it's a silly movie, it only has one shot that they looked at the screen – something I only like in very small portions – and when they did, it was absolutely hilarious and the movie kept to what it was: spoof of war films, or the war itself, or Nazis. In either case, it didn't go in 50 directions like recent and unbearable spoofs, like Scary Movie 2, 3, 4, etc.Highly recommended for those who do love the 1980's, genuine spoofs and booted cows. Make sure you go to the special features on the disc – the deleted are really funny and I'm surprised they were cut, and there's an Easter Egg concerning yet another hilarious scene and its original format. One scene, I might have missed, but I recall a scene in which the table 'rises' with the gentlemen's excitement and I didn't see it this time. I'll watch it again, but I'm kind of disappointed that wasn't here. AnywaysSEE IT!",8,5,7,9 July 2010
The Bourne Ultimatum," The Ultimate End to the Ultimate Trilogy
","I have one request that I know will fall upon deaf Hollywood ears: Stop at The Bourne Ultimatum. Please. Stop screwing up wonderful trilogies, movies series with an overkill part IV. This series doesn't need it. The Bourne series has a wonderful, realistic, suspenseful and near-perfect storyline that began with Bourne floating in the ocean and ending with this movie. Though part 2, or Supremacy, wasn't bad, hardly at all, it was nothing compared to the thrilling conclusion of the trilogy. Bourne's still railing over the loss of Marie (in Supremacy) while getting closer to unraveling his sordid past. We take up his journey across the globe and learn new secrets and clues along with him. All the while, the film's action packed, but with a brain, or, a well-scripted plot. Again, we have Joan Allen, one of my all time favorite actresses outshining the rest of the cast. I loved the cinematography, I loved the dialogue and the fight scenes were top notch, and as I mentioned previously with part 1, or Identity, it's awesome to see a true action movie without obvious CGI-scenes. I loved how they took the time to make a true spy thriller with real scenes in which I believed the characters to be in real danger. Okay, now the bad: you'll sure have to shut off the suspension of disbelief momentarily in certain scenes. Such as when Bourne is being chased on the roofs while chasing someone on the ground he's trying to protect and happens to keep up marvelously with her and when he exits a multistory car crash drop and gets out very little shaken and barely stirred. Overall, extremely recommended as the end-credit song that appears in all three movies: Moby's Extreme Ways. A fitting song and one of my favorites.a",10,6,7,1 December 2012
Fargo," Another Simple Plan
","Well, I was hoping this snowy movie would help on August 1st, since it's too damned hot out and there's probably another 3 months of summer in Glendale, Arizona. Eh, not really.I have only seen this movie once before, I believe in late 1996 or 1997, so it's been awhile. Despite the nearly two decade absence, I'm usually good at remembering movie's specific scenes, plot points and dialogue. Here, I barely remembered 20% of the actions in this. It probably didn't help that I know I got laid that night when I invited my friend over to see this. To my defense, we probably got it on during the viewing.Maybe that was a good thing. It was interesting to revisit this as practically a first time. There's just so much that happens and it made it all seem so real, despite the lie at the beginning of the film that this was a true story. (Extremely loosely based is NOT a 'true story' in my book. I could see a horrific traffic accident and decide to write an alien invasion story that involved a car crash. That wouldn't make that a true story. Much like this.)I've never been to Fargo or any of the many towns featured here, let alone Minnesota and though I've heard of 'the accent' and key phrases 'Don'tcha know' and 'Yeeeeeah.' I don't think I'd want to visit if this movie was accurate with the dialect. Man, this movie was tough to get through at times with all the Sarah Palin-type slurs. Again, since I've never been to these locations, I cannot verify if any of this is true to the locals. But, dang, if the snow didn't do me in, the talking would.I digress, the acting, tension and incredible script is completely worthwhile here and makes this a recommendation. The fact that it keeps going and going and the less than stellar police keep up with what's happening is probably part of the most unbelievable, but enjoyable parts. Frances McDormand's Marge is a dumbed down Columbo, but William H. Macy's Jerry was the real star here. Have to hate him, especially at his job, but I got more invested in him that the film's award-winning main attraction of McDormand. I think the Coens perfected this movie years later with No Country For Old Men, but they still did a great job with this effort and it's totally recommended.* * *Final thoughts: To give a little background, lazy and unintelligible word usage, namely filler words, irritate the crap out of me. It's unoriginal, unimaginative and worst of all, unnecessary. Thank God for earplugs as definitely need them at my job to attempt to block out all the 'Yeeeeeah's I hear roughly 78 times a day, mostly from one person. Oh, and while we're on this movie, just an FYI, Office Space is much more a 'true story' than Fargo was. Apply at a call center, get hired and try to dispute that statement. I'll wait.",7,0,0,1 August 2015
Predator," Go Back to the Future of the original Alien Hunter
","Men hiding in the bushes. Check. Much younger girl captured and tied. Check. Girl afraid for her life. Check.Okay, fine, it's not that kind of Predator movie. Not even close, but I doubt this would be the title if released today. (Yep, Predators opens 7/9/10, but that's only after the established 1987 name was given.) Is this not one of the epitome of a Guy's Movie? Shallow plot, explosions, girl in distress, gun/knife battles, rippling muscles, aliens and Schwarzenegger. No wonder most call this a classic, though I would add: it's a DUDE's classic.The reason I don't call it a 'real' classic, is because, I simply can't get past the incredibly paper-thin storyline. That's not to say it has an interesting concept about an out-of-this-world hunter, hunter-turned-prey, prey-turned-hero, etc. It did have some good graphics, and I admit when they wanted to put huge guys to be the best of the best in a jungle warfare setting fighting 3 enemies – man, themselves and, of course, an alien, they succeeded in spades.If you're looking for a deeper Schwarzenegger classic, with just as much action, but with storyline and originality, you could do much better: The Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Total Recall and True Lies, to name a few.Wow, let's now tackle the incredibly deep plot: The elite group of soldiers are dropped behind enemy lines in the jungle on a search-and-rescue mission. Right off the bat, they realize they're in over their head when the targets are hanging, skinless and bloody, literally over their heads.Blaming nearby guerillas gives the film crew an excuse to have an extensive action scene and for Schwarzenegger say some 'funny' but out of place one-liners. Wait, it might not be the newly slaughtered men. Could it be the entity that landed in a space ship shown in shot one? Duh, but we're not there yet. First they have to have the fight-amongst-themselves scenes, a hostage and the realizations as they're picked off one-by-one.Once all that's through, I believe, is where the movie gets better. Schwarzenegger calms his signature only-in-the-movies lines, and does battle with both brawn and brains, though the 'setting the traps' does go on a little too long.Then again, despite the spin-offs and sequels, who better to really take on the Predator than Schwarzenegger? When the movie opened, and during the credits, I saw the name Alan Silvestri attached to the score and remembered that name. Without a second thought, or time, I was immediately reminded who he is and if you're as familiar or a fan of the Back to the Future trilogy as I am, you'll recognize his technique/style throughout the entire movie. From beginning to end. Every second.Unfortunately, that was tough getting through. Just like Danny Elfman is enormously recognizable with his music, so was Silvestri here. I like originality when it comes to composers, such as John Williams who envisions the project at hand and brings them to life with perfection and never duplicating.That didn't lower my overall rating, but it didn't help. (Much like Titanic's composer, James Horner, who barely lifted a muscle to change his Titanic score when 'creating' the Avatar music.) I would recommend it, but it's definitely a leave-your-brain-at-the-door film. It won't change the world, but it did introduce a great character, The Predator, (with rules – I did like that) to see more in films in the future (of 1987, that is.)",5,2,13,10 July 2010
Oblivion," Wall-E Returns: Bigger n' Larger
","Without trying to give anything away and beyond the grand scale and excellent cinematography, Oblivion survives and thrives on greattwists.Admittedly, I did want to see this in theatres – yes: I am a die-hard Tom Cruise fan, but I missed it on the big screen. I did think the trailers gave away too much, but that didn't detour me from seeing it. I just got lazy. At any rate, I was wrong.The sneak previews for Oblivion only made me think of a live-action version of Pixar's Wall-E. While, it does begin that way – sorta – and the cinematography in both films is brilliant, fresh and gorgeous, the based-on-a-graphic-novel-idea Oblivion turns into a very nicely written story of 'I didn't see that coming!' twists.Jack & Victoria are put on a mostly-destroyed Earth of the future to help harvest needed supplies after a tremendous alien war in which humans 'won,' but now have to reside on a far distant moon. Machines assist, but it's really up to the duo to ensure success. OnlyJack's developing 'unnecessary emotions' that might disrupt his mission. This leads to that, that leads to discovery and mystery and finally totrue love?Trust me: I haven't given anything (of significance) away. The joy in this movie, again, besides the crisp scenery, is what you'll learn along the way.Now, with all this praise I've given this sci-fi, futuristic yarn, it's not without its problems.At times, it has M. Night Shyamalan (The Happening) and Nicholas Winding Refn's (Only God Forgives) sense of SLOWED DOWN for SUPPOSED SUSPENSE scenes. Yes, I do have a problem with characters slowly walking across the room that somehow translates into tension. I don't buy it and it just drags out scenes. Also, while I am a fan (as stated) of Cruise and the Mission: Impossible series, it was not refreshing to see Cruise reprise his yelling role from the first and weakest entry of that action series. Finally, the movie really produced no real characters I found that broke any mold. While all actors played their part the best they could, none stood out or made me take notice.Thoroughly, beyond my last criticisms, I did have a good time and I look forward to seeing it again. It did have a good portion of action and beautiful scenes. But, most of all, I love how the story played out in the last act.And that moon! What an awesome, albeit terrifying sight! Be kind to our moon, people: Walk on it all you want, but leave it be!",8,1,3,6 August 2013
Bird Box," See What's Happening Now?
","Well, at least the Cloverfield monster didn't show up.Never thought (hoped?) I'd SEE a M. Night Shyamalan remake, but here goes. Bird Box is definitely his Happening Ver. 2 and though somewhat better than the unintentionally hilarious Shyamalan 'thriller,' it's still a terrible idea and now contains even worse characters.This is like one of those terrible SyFy knockoffs to feed off the Quiet Place bucks. This film's twist? Instead of having to be quiet, our antiheroes have to lose SIGHT. Well, of vision, continuity, logic, reason, brains and physics. Just to name a few.Suddenly Death shows up and anyone caught looking at it wants to commit suicide. Survivors do their survival thing, such as hold up in once location, fight, have montages and come up explanations on why Death's at their doorstep.The movie writes itself into a corner so it comes up with human slaves of Death who lure people to LOOOOOOK and this causes the survivors to LOOOOOOK elsewhere for shelter.Honestly, the movie's not the worst I've SEEN, but it's way too long, too bleak, includes subpar and lazy special effects, was badly written, has huge plot holes, was hardly original and worst of all: Sandra Bullock, the anchor of the film.My guess: Bullock has been on a kick late into her career to shed any decency she had left by playing bland, boring or downright disgustingly bad characters. She was possibly the worst part of Ocean's Eight and here, I hated her from minute one. And she never regained any sparkle in my EYE.Yes, I understood her character and motivations. I pieced together her past and reasons why she acts the way she does, but damn, she is despicable and the whole movie falls on her shoulders. Even her enormously predictable character arc wouldn't save her. The movie's barely worth WATCHING, and she nearly brought the whole mess down. How anyone would want to be ten feet close to her before this Happening is baffling and following, it's even more torturous since there are so few humans to be around.I hope they didn't set this up to be a franchise or TV series as it seems like they did. These original two hours are ones I never want to SEE again.***Final thoughts: Shocked they didn't get Kristen Stewart to play the lead. She's always playing dour and depressing characters that people always seem to mysteriously flock to in movies even though in real life, no one would ever want to give them the time of day. I know I wouldn't. To either person.",2,3,6,4 January 2019
Watchmen," Who watches their watch during a movie?
","'Who watches the 'Watchmen'?' I'm sure a couple of hundred of thousands will the first week. Maybe a few more when the 'Watchmen' gets released in a few months on DVD. Between that time, I doubt many will.It's got the unfortunate (about) 3 hour time frame (and believe me, you'll feel every minute of those 163 minutes) and the 'not-for-kids'/hard R superhero movie violence, profanity and nudity against it. Whereas 'The Dark Knight' was probably the most adult, real-life super-hero movie, 'Watchmen' really, really wants to be an adult super-hero movie. Almost like a 13-year-old comic book-geek wishing he was older.Visually stunning in some scenes, enormously graphic in others, 'Watchmen' isn't a terrible movie; it just simply tries too hard. Maybe it tried too hard to put all of its source material in the stand-alone film. Granted, I never read the original comics/graphic novel, so this is all from an outside POV. But I see now why 'Stephen King's The Stand' made its way to the small screen instead. (And I did read that original novel.) Basically, 'Watchmen' disguises itself as film noir, setting itself all over the place from the 1940s to present day/alternate 1985 (reminds me of another alternate 1985 in 'Back to the Future Part II,' as did their version of multiple-elected Nixon reminded me of older Biff in the same film. This absolutely made me laugh whenever Nixon was on the screen. I'm not sure if that was intended, but it certainly was distracting.) Half the time, I had a hard time keeping up with past, future, most recent past; I finally gave up, reminding myself to sort it out later.It's really just a mystery of who's killing off the superheroes and why. Unfortunately, it starts off that way, and then you almost have to wait the other 150 minutes or so to get back to the plot A. Plots B, C, D, etc are almost forgettable and at times slow. Sure, they seemed to know when it was slow, as they immediately threw in someone getting chopped, sliced, and murdered with a loud action sequence.I liked the visuals, the style and a multiple super-hero movie with characters they either did explain how they became super-human, or simply left as a mystery. The not knowing sometimes was even better. However, this is the same fear I have for the long-delayed 'Justice League' movie: 12 or so origin-stories, a 12-hour movie makes. I certainly couldn't take even 15 more minutes in this film to figure out how one character's mask shifts.And I did like two of the characters: The Comedian and Rorschach (though when behind the ink, or eventually unmasked, is dead-on for a young Clint Eastwood.) Their interesting presence actually made me sit up and pay attention.Unfortunately, the movie had to deal with other characters. Some so laughable, we ended back up with the mind of the 13-year-old nerd who thought these up when doodling during History class.We had the world's smartest man, who never said one intelligent thing or had any sort of a brilliant idea. We had a girl in spandex (tell me she wasn't thought up by a 13-year-old boy) who's main powers are, well, uh, dressing nice, slow-mo hair and some karate from the movies. We had a dumbed-down Iron Man/Batman who was about as interesting as pocket lent.And finally, we have Dr. Manhattan. A very, very naked Dr. Manhattan. Though this didn't offend me and I absolutely appreciated this adaptation wasn't trying to shield its audience dropping its level to PG-13 status. But, come-on, I haven't seen this much full frontal male nudity since, well, never in the theater. When I saw 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall,' I definitively heard the male audience wince at the roughly 12-seconds (in the entire film) of Jason Segel's penis. I can't wait to hear the fanboy's reaction to male genitalia roughly every 4-5 scenes.But enough about his smurf-blue penis. His character was mildly interesting, but what frustrated me about 'Lord of the Rings' is the same in 'Watchmen.' Whenever there's a character with basically omnipotent power, the solution to solving all of Earth's (or Middle Earth's) problems seems so clear and no one seems to want or thinks to use such power. How about wiping out the Earth's nuclear bombs with a single thought (or just blinking that ring to that volcano)? Yes, I realize there's a lot of 'learning' to do and it would end up as a 15-minute short film given my solution. But given I have little patience, a 3 hour (or 9 with 'Rings') movie probably wasn't suited for me anyways.The music was loud, overbearing and too much of an 80s homage. The dialogue, at times, was hilariously bad. And when the twist is revealed in the closing, I almost laughed (again, probably unintentionally) on how everyone went on as if nothing happened.'Watchmen' is worth a watch, but I should've just wanted the couple of months for DVD. I certainly needed several breaks. Heck, even 'Lord of the Rings' let a year pass between 'learning' sessions so you can recoup.",3,12,25,7 March 2009
The Bourne Identity," The Start of a Masterpiece Trilogy
","As a fan of James Bond, but acknowledging its campiness, clichés and formulas, it was extremely refreshing to see a true spy/action movie with a movie star I already respected, but never thought could pull it off: Matt Damon. Damon did a superb job as Jason Bourne in The Bourne Identity as did the rest of the cast. You rooted for him, sympathized with him and despite the past you soon learn to question, you still wanted him to succeed. Bourne is found without a memory in the ocean by fishermen who attempt to help the young man by dropping him off, with a little bit of cash, near a place, Switzerland, where he might regain his identity. There he learns of extraordinary fighting skills he was unaware of and meets the soon-to-be (and obvious) love of his life, Marie. Both try and piece his past together, while formulating a future together, albeit on the run from a mysterious 'Treadstone' organization. The action, when shown, is intense, the intrigue storyline is not only plausible, but on-the-edge of your seat exciting, and the cinematography is stunning – I must visit Paris, France soon. The only flaws I can find (though I didn't look for them) was the obvious pairing of Marie and Bourne, their inevitable sex scene, and Marie's accent (and languages) that jumped from one culture to the next. Other than those minor defects, this was a wonderful, suspenseful and crafty movie. I absolutely loved them reverting (as they did with the as-good sequels) from CGI and made me believe in action again and not the green screen. Also, despite knowing there was more than one book this was based upon and knowing sequels were in the works, I loved this was a completely stand alone feature and is absolutely recommended.",10,5,6,1 December 2012
Justice League," Justice Another Nail
","So, this was directed by two people. Two completely separate visions. And it shows.There are moments in Justice League that are good, really good, even, but you're going to have to wait until about half the movie's over before they kick in. Yeah, it takes a tremendous amount of time to get to the goods and Superman, of course.I don't care that the trailers, posters, advertising, etc, left out Kal-El – it was painfully obvious he was coming back. I had just prayed they wouldn't wait until the last 5 minutes to reveal his return.Mercifully, I was wrong, but not too far off. He's definitely not the spotlight here. That's reserved for more, well, amateur superheroes. I guess they're going for the They're All New To This Job, like how the president's moronic moments are being justified. Take Batman. Leave him on his own and he's badass and the smartest person in the room. You give him partners and you have: Batman & Robin and now, Justice League.Basically, Bruce knows something bad is coming and he attempts to gather up the other 'special' beings to stop a watered down villain and motives. Once everyone's gathered, well, most everyone, they pull a Danny Ocean: 'You think we need one more?...You think we need one more...All right, we'll get one more.' (Or, just an excuse to get Superman back in the League he's always all-but led.) Now, while it's shoddily written and easy enough for kids to follow and yet too adult for them to see, it does have some fantastic new characters I wouldn't mind seeing more of: The Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman. Wonder Woman was a badass fighter and brought a lot of humor to the movie. Batman was just okay. And Superman was a 180 from his previous two outings from Henry Cavill and a whole lot fun to watch the few times he was on screen.I remember this was SUPPOSED to be part one of two, or one larger movie split into two, but since that wore down the audiences with increasingly failed attempts, it was scrapped. Not to mention, the DCU isn't (mostly) well received. This movie truly felt like two movies crammed into one and with too many 'Oh! There's that character!' and 'Oh! There's that comic book subplot!' Honestly, they should've gone the Marvel route and had everyone had their own origin movies and then get them all together, slowly but surely.Eh, it's not necessarily a terrible movie, but not one I want to rush to see again. I will say it was nice that Danny Elfman was composing and brought back some nostalgia from past movie series. I just think the cast and crew were just as confused at what was going on as were our superheroes who were trying to save the world. DCU: Just stop. Wait a few years, woo writers from Disney and start over again. ***Final thoughts: Not many DCU movies out there, so here's my Top Five Faves!1. Man of Steel (★★★★★/5 Stars.)2. Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition (★★★★★/5 Stars.)3. Wonder Woman (★★★★/5 Stars.)4. Suicide Squad: Extended Cut (★★★/5 Stars.)5. Justice League (★★½/5 Stars.)",4,1,4,19 November 2017
The Matrix Revolutions," The Matrix Revultion
","I might get a lot of flak for comparing 'The Matrix Revolutions' with 'Lord of the Rings 3,' however each had the same concept: 1st half was basically nothing followed by the enviable second act 'final battle.' Sure when the big bang sets off, it's non-stop CGI. Is it exciting? No. It's just 'look at what we can do with a budget' technology. Zero characters we cared about, so if they lived, died, sliced, diced, we could care less. In fact, I might have secretly hoped the humans perished; at least the computer & its renegade programs had heart. And enough with the 'why, why, why' whining Neo. He's playing dumb, and though that's his forte, by this third installment, it's just plain annoying. As parts two and three were filmed simultaneously, I felt more and more sorry for wonderful actors Moss and Fishburne who, by this point, are just jumping through hoops held by the Wachowskis, much as Jackson and McGregor did for Lucas in the 'Star Wars' mediocre prequels. I've already given the summary, but here's even more depth: Neo, Trinity and gang must stop Agent Smith, aid and be aided by the (new) Oracle, and ward off a 10,000,000 to 1 fight against the machines. While the movie's a waste, three things irked me beyond recovery. #1 Yes, unfortunately, Gloria Foster, who played the Oracle in Parts 1-2, died in real life, they made such a stink about a new 'form' (or actress) Oracle – seriously. Just say 1 line that she decided a new shell and move on. #2 A main character dies in the end – for like seven minutes. #3 You ever wait for a train for too long? You will in this film as well. Only two scenes fared well: Neo's finale with Smith and the Oracle/Architect's conversation. Sadly, those added up to the only 15 decent minutes out of 129.",2,1,3,17 June 2009
Man of Steel," Superman Reborn
","(Update – 6/15/13, Second Viewing: Superman soars from 4/5 stars to 5/5. Gone were any of the flaws I listed below. A lot more is explained with the second viewing. Everything clearer. The heroism portrayed was refreshing because people who did heroic acts in this movie did them because they needed to be done – not because they wanted to be a hero or heroic. The movie isn't perfect, but it's damn close and I am glad for this second viewing to prove this movie is much better than I originally saw it. Solid 5/5 Stars. Now, here's my original review below, unedited)From the relatively quick Krypton opening, Man of Steel quickly gets to the goods and, like 1989's Batman, it saves us from the rehash of the Smallville chronicles and just provides the necessary flashbacks that made Clark who he will become. I mean, really. Smallville was on for 10 TV seasons. If you wanted to see that, spent that much time in front of the TV. This is a Superman movie!Butit's not the Superman you or I grew up and loved. This is new, fresh, exciting and more real than ever before. There was so much good that was added, altered and enhanced that I embraced every change including one MAJOR modification that I will not ethically spoil.Now, this is not all to say we need to forget the silliness – okay, OVER-comical previous films. If you want to see that, simply watch them. This is a brand new vision of my all-time favorite superhero and after watching the previous entries countless times, it was absolutely breathtaking to see such a new twist and explore a new avenue never been done before.In 2006, Superman Returns simply continued the storyline from Superman II (yeah, it told you to forget III and IV ever existed, and for the most part, most people had, even without Returns.) Returns used the same characters, the same campiness, the same music, the same Kryptonite and even a guy who looked and acted exactly like the late and great Christopher Reeve.And that's all well and good. It's also good that was the end of that saga. Much like what happened to The Dark Knight Trilogy's mythology. Hopefully.I didn't know what to expect here. More of the same, i.e. reboot but with all the same themes and the same Superman and his morals? No. This couldn't have been further from the old series.I loved Henry Cavill as Superman/Kal-El/Clark. (Oops, sorry, spoiler there. Duh.) I loved his depth, his convictions and his imperfections. I love that he is NOT the Christopher Reeve version of the last son of Krypton. And just to clarify, I love both versions of Superman. Nicely, now I can choose which I would like to watch once this hits home video and I need my Supe-fix.You may think you know the story of Kal-El, but all that remains is that Krypton does fall, General Zod & Friends are banished and imprisoned and baby Kal does end up with the Kents in Kansas. From thereIt's a whole new world.Clark's trying to find himself, his way, his future and his past. Along his journey, he does meet up with Lois and she's as equally altered as is this version of the Man of Steel. Simultaneously, that nasty Zod gang does make their way to Earth and has some things up their sleeves.Will 'Superman' – or so they call him – rise to the occasion and prove himself as a world-class hero? You think you know the answer?The movie had incredible graphics, wonderful flying sequences, great sound, decent score and the acting is believable from all fronts. Butnow that all my praise is out there, the movie isn't perfect by any means. Number one, the writing is offquite a bit at times. So much so, it will be probably my inevitable second viewing before I can piece together all that was wrong with it. They do throw quite a bunch at you to distract you from any script problems. Also, it didn't help that my 3D-glasses were a bit scratched. Luckily, I didn't find the 3-D all that great, so my next viewings will be cheaper as I hang those glasses up.In addition to the sometimes poor writing, is the sketchy editing and perhaps too many flashbacks to the point it's hard to decipher past and present. I mean, I don't believe Martha Kent aged a bit in 30 years! (If she was real, she might consider that a compliment, untilshe realizes I meant she looked ancient back then and still does in present day.)There is far more to love in this movie than those points of criticism. Personally, I was so wrapped up in the newness and fresh aspect – even though I grew up knowing Superman one (completely different) way – that even when I knew there were script issues, I didn't care. I loved the new Superman, the new direction and can't wait to see where this is headed.The incredible action also helped in my fun time. After the comedy Iron Man 3, it's nice to put the action back into the original Action Comic.",10,8,17,14 June 2013
Footloose," Six Degrees of Dancing
","Honestly, I had to revisit this small (minded) town once I saw the 2011 Footloose remake trailer.The biggest question I have is: how the hell could they make this relevant in today's time? Though it was a 100% iconic 80s movie, it was probably barely relevant then – 27 years ago.I'm referring to the basic premise of a kid, Ren (Ha – it's so hard to think of the all-around guy, Kevin Bacon, as a 'kid') moving with his single mother to a small, religious town where it's – GASP – illegal to dance. Heck, it was probably frowned upon the mom being a single mother, but that's not explored.Well, Ren can't sit still, let alone fit in, until he makes friends (and a few enemies) and he shakes things up, namely with the great and powerful Reverend Shaw Moore (John Lithgow) and his stunning (for 1984, that is) daughter, Ariel (Lori Singer.)So, they cross many barriers, including county lines to put on a senior danceWait, you don't know the premise of Footloose by now? If not, let me also fill you in who Luke Skywalker's father isUnfortunately, the first half of the movie does NOT hold up wellfor those who have never seen this. I did grow up with this, so none of the (ENORMOUSLY, EXCEEDINGLY) dated scenes really bothered me that much, nor the music – it's one of my all-time favorite soundtracks, after all.Kids these daysno I mean it: Kids, these days, try and get past the 'ancient' feel of the movie and at least, dive into the second half, that surprisingly replaces main character Ren and his 'growth' and shifts to the Reverend Moore's development, with help from his wife, Vi (the always lovely Dianne Wiest.) In a sense, Moore becomes the new main character and it's absolutely believable and touching. You literally stop rooting for Ren, as his character never changes (not that he needed to) and cheer for Moore to succeed.The movie's a lot deeper than it appears on the surface, or synopsis. Again, it has a fantastic soundtrack and believable small town ignorance. I will say, boy they could get away with murder back then. And, yeah, I noticed this as a kid, as well: in addition to 'guys giving the birdie,' language and themes, there's a shower/locker room scene with several male backsides exposed. Gees, and it was PG. Today it would be R. Maybe the good, ole Reverend has put his mark on the MPAA in today's timesAnd speaking of today's timesI must see the latest remake in Hollywood, of this classic. I want to see how they explain how 'dancing' is so bad when it's so clearly 'okay' according to Ren who quotes from the same Bible the Reverend uses to speak out against it (in a great town hall scene in this movie.)Beyond people who grew up with this movie, it's highly recommended to today's kids who want to see what (God, I feel old for saying this) kind of lives and troubles their parents had to endure in their own childhood.",8,1,3,25 June 2011
28 Weeks Later," What Happens in London
","With another interesting concept for an 'infected person' movie (over the typical 'zombie' film) they certainly stuck with the usual platform for a sequel: 2x the gore, 2x the madness. '28 Weeks Later' takes an already wonderful movie and actually continues with originality: what happens next? How does society survive an outbreak? Well, if we were a smart race, we could certainly overcome this 'rage' virus that spread roughly 7 months prior. And after a very scary introduction to those unfamiliar with the original '28 Days Later,' the movie continues with a 'good solution' to rebuild humanity. Of course, the movie then dives into stupid people doing stupid stuff and the virus, supposedly eliminated by the infected starving to death (loved that over just having to shoot zombies in the head), actually resurfaces. This causes man to do even more stupid stuff to stop it once again. Watching it on a grand scale/Bird's Eye POV, it's hard to even imagine trying to contain such a brutal fast-spreading virus, especially with hordes of victims at its disposal. Though I really liked this movie, at times, it was hard to watch, due to the excessive gore (I take back what I previous said about it being 2x gorier – this was probably 10x more gorier than the now subdued '28 Days Later') and the one thing that irked me in the last third. Not to spoil it, but a certain 'infected' person always seems to pop up always at the most opportune times, just when the script needs this person to, always finding the victims he/she wants when they are supposedly just running on instinct. Despite the gore (#1 didn't need that for a good story) and the Super-Infected-Phantom, it's a very good follow-up and I look forward to any more to follow.",7,1,1,2 November 2009
The Thing," Here's the Thing
","If Man is a predator, and he is, and there's a prequel to this rebooted Antarctica-based movie also named 'The Thing,' isn't this also another Antarctica-based prequel to a rebooted movie named 'Alien vs. Predator?' Mindblown.Not really, but they do say imitation is the greatest form of flattery. Ba-Da-Bum, thank you I, or whoever copies me, will be here all week.They also say this is the best remake of all-time as well as the best horror movie of all-time. While I disagree with both statements, it's still one helluva good movie. It's essentially 1979's Alien on Earth, but less concentration on the characters. Where Ridley Scott's movie really defined the victims in space, this one was all-but a slasher movie where very few of the men (and yeah, only men) had enough personalities to distinguish them to remember their names. Sure, I recognized some of the actors from other films, and the always-excellent Kurt Russell stood out, most of the researchers were just body counts.The movie revolves around said researchers segregated in the Antarctic when the title character shows up to replicate anything it comes in contact with. Paranoia ensues between both the men and the audience on who is 'The Thing' and who is for real. One by one, they're taken apart, sometimes literally and it's up to the strong and smart to outthink the THINGNow, I've seen this movie before many years ago and more recently, I saw the prequel in 2011. I liked both, and still have yet to see the original from 1951. I can imagine the original's total camp from that sci-fi, alien vs. the world-era. In addition to so many things I liked about this movie was the (I suspect) homage in the opening credits where a generic flying saucer, or U.F.O., comes crashing down on Earth. So cheesy in an otherwise incredibly inventive and ahead-of-its-time feature. Nicely done, Mr. (Director) Carpenter. I know the background. I know this was Carpenter's pet project since he made my personal favorite horror movie, 1978's Halloween. I also know they made the entire set themselves – prettydamnimpressive. So kudos to Carpenter and gang for such a remarkable and non-modern, CGI-feat. We don't get real filmmaking like this today and I, like most film- buffs, miss terribly. Sure, CGI is most cost-effective, it's just not as effectivevisually.While the two biggest issues I had with the film upon my initial viewing was the paranoia – 'Who Is The Thing?' got kinda tedious (until they straightened that out) and at times, they seemed to be making things up as they went along (i.e. What Special Creature Effect Can We Come Up with Next,) the enormously original ending, or last few frames, made up for any shortcomings from my own end. LOVED THE ENDING. Overall, it's an absolute classic and refreshing to revisit from time to time. Completely timeless, it can be seen many years from now and still have the same effect as it had almost 35 years ago upon its initial release. This well paced, tense and never boring film is completely recommended for not just horror buffs, but movie-lovers, as well.***Final thoughts: I have to find that YouTube video again. I remember seeing a review of this in which they showed a bunch of comparisons to the original and made fun of how many doors the characters entered through. Now thatwould be a fun way of (mostly) watching the original without having to put up with cheap, early 50s FX.",8,1,3,27 September 2016
The Revenant," Dances with Bear orThe Hateful One
","While not my type of film, there's no mistaking it; The Revenant is one outstandingly made film. From cinematography, story, acting, scoreit's probably destined to win best picture. While not my favorite movie of the year, again, not my brand of cinema and the movie never seemed to end, I wouldn't have a problem with it taking home the gold. Maybe Leo can FINALLY win one, as well. As good as he's been in the past, if he didn't give his all here, I don't know what it'll take.While the story begins confusing – very little is spelled out, it becomes fairly simple. In probably thee most realistic animal attacks I've seen, the 1800's Cap'n Glass wrestles with a bear and is eventually left for dead by his men. When the even worse circumstance happens, it's man vs. nature leading into man vs. man.The Revenant isn't a movie I ever want to see again, but I can appreciate all the efforts, scope, heart and depth that went into this production. It's an unmistakably realistic Western if I've ever seen one.Not for kids and not for the mainstream, it's still recommended for cinema and (real) Old West lovers.",8,1,5,2 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," To Try a Mockingbird
","Yes, it had an interesting story and kept my interest – though the end 'true story' statements from a Cuba negotiation sounded more heroic, but Argo, it was not. And I wasn't even the biggest fan of Argo.So, why all the Oscar buzz? Oh, I guess they still love historical, 'based on a true rescue,' Hanks/Spielberg movies. These nominations, year after year, are making me sadder. They consistently snub GREAT films for mediocre homages. Was this a great film? Hell no. Was it very good? Nope. It falls in the 'good' category with some good dialogue and performances. Mercifully, it won't win any Oscars, but damn, those voters really wanted you to remember they love these guys no matter what they accomplish.Picture it, U.S.A., Brooklyn 1950s – the other Best Pic nominated movie set in that timeframe. Reluctant lawyer defends a publicly convicted Soviet spy and through negotiations, he helps to remind us what America is all about.That is as basic as I will be with the synopsis. The rest of the story you can see unravel as Hanks is used as a puppet that pushes back to do the right thing. Again, it's interesting enough for the movie. Worth almost 2½ hours? Nope, but maaaybe if you're a cold-war buff who can't get enough of the Hanks/Spielberg combo.",5,8,12,16 January 2016
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," It Gets Real(er)
","'This is the 'Sh|t Gets Real' episode' - Kevin Carr, from The Idiot Boxers. 'Welcome to primetime, Bitch,' – Freddy Krueger.I knew this was coming. We all knew this was coming.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part Uno, or HP7a, was a given since the start. We knew, even without spoilers from viewers, the series was bound to get darker, more deadly – or is that, deathly? – and seriously serious. Harry had to grow up finally and begin his final stages to get to his nemesis, No-Nose.Well, it was welcome, after the terrible, over-kill bridge movie Part VI was. That one, Half-Blood Prince, connected the exciting, thrilling and best of the series, Part V, or Order of the Phoenix, and this first chapter of the finale.Yes, my opinions are not well-received, but allow me to honestly say just that: I was honest in my feelings towards Part VI – it contained 20 special, interesting and important minutes, but the rest was garbage. If only those were tacked onto this one, or the previous, it would've flowed better.I digress, we're here for HP7a. School's out forever, it appears as Harry and the good witches of all directions are on the lam after No-Nose and his army is preparing to devastate everything. Now, since I'm not caught up on the books, after only having read the first one, I'm puzzled why more Muggles don't see these attacks from No-Nose, or it's not more widely spread. But, anywaysThe mystery of the series, the adventure and most of the heart is back as Harry's pals get beaten down, and the overall threat is more real. It's actually a fairly simple plot of gathering objects and clues, but the route to both was rather fun, albeit slow at times.In Part VI, a significant character passes onto the Magical Kingdom of the Sky, but the one character who dies here (obviously, no spoilin') in the finale actually affected me the most. And yes, I'm even jumping ahead to HP7b of all 8 movies, the one that dies here almost made me tear up and I'm sorry to see her/him go.At any rateeven with a rather slower mid-section, the movie starts off with a punch, it's fun, dark, mature and finishes at a perfect time to get you psyched for the grand finale to come(Editor's Note: I decided to listen to the masses for this Harry POTter phenomena and revisit the series. I've only seen the first two, both once and in first run theatres. Since it's been around a decade since the initial releases, I've started over with #1 and will get to what everyone calls: the better years. Cheerio!)",6,1,1,3 March 2013
Kung Fu Panda 2," Kung Fu Delight
","Kung Fu Panda 2 is an 'awesome' delight.They managed, somehow, to match the quality, action, humor, cinematography, heart and story of the original. And they kept it short, sweet and to the pointquite a feat.And I actually waited to video to see this thinking it would be just okay or overkill like most cartoon sequels. I was wrong.I loved this movie and if there is no Part III, I'm thoroughly satisfied with the series to this point.It's a must see, if you haven't already. 4½/5 stars.(Luckily, there will be a III, but sadly, not for another few years.)",8,1,2,1 December 2012
North by Northwest," Go North, Northwest or any direction to see this masterpiece
","Yet another masterpiece from the master, Hitchcock. Sure, I've seen very few of his films and I'm really partial to Psycho and The Birds, but North By Northwest is no short of a classic.Granted, this movie may seem dated now, 50 years later, and furthermore, I doubt, if remade, like Psycho, any of the events of this movie couldn't even be remotely possible today, given its time and shape of cinema in the late 1950s, this was a perfect movie. It had absolutely everything: adventure, mistaken identity, comedy, romance, spy and the everyman charm of one of the greatest actors of all time, Grant. He was absolutely perfect in his role, an instant charisma that made you believe in, root for and be like at all times. No one could do it better.As for Eva Marie Saint, she was wonderful too. It's funny. I'm a huge Superman fan (since age 3) and during this updated viewing of the classic, I kept trying to picture her nearly 50 years older in Superman Returns as Martha Kent. I couldn't do itthey just didn't look like. Despite that, she was great in her seductive role.Grant plays Roger O. Thornhill, a thriving ad-exec, who is mistaken for super-spy George Kaplan and gets thrust into a world he's unaccustomed to – the other side of the road. See, he's a self-proclaimed liar (advertising) and now that the shoe's on the other foot, he must adjust.Not before long, he's accused of drunk-driving (which, as I pointed out before, most of these scenes wouldn't work today; here, the DUI's all but comical), murder, eluding the police, etc, etc. He's trying to solve the mystery, survive and romance a stranger (oooorrrr, is she???) on a train, Saint.As in most Hitchcock classics, I'm always drawn to the intrigue, suspense, originality and acting, but I think overall – the dialogue. Here it's pristine. Sure, Grant is responsible for 90% of it, but Saint also delivers some zingers. And to this day, again, 50 years later, is still fresh, funny and moves the story in a perfect rhythm. I can't even think of many movies today that develop such a punch for such witty and sharp dialogue.I think all should see this: young, old, people that first saw this in theatres, or to those who need to put the Wii down for a few hours. It's a fun, extremely family-friendly film that has tremendous depth, layers, adventure and allows the audience to pretend (or I would as a kid) to be someone else, this Thornhill/Kaplan character.",10,1,4,17 December 2009
Knowing," Now, I know, and unfortunately, knowing was half the battle
","Wow, I read what others wrote about Nicolas Cage's performance in 'Knowing' and I have to agree. He was laughably awful in this movie. He had multiple 'Keanu Reeves' outbursts that cracked me up. I don't agree with what a lot of critics are saying that he didn't deserve his Oscar for 'Leaving Las Vegas'  oh, he sure as heck did. Unfortunately, he's picked a tremendous amount of stinkers since then. Including 'Knowing.' Though, not a terrible movie, but it's nearly two hours (and you'll feel every bit of them) and I saw many scenes that could've been easily cut. I kept trying to calculate between 30-45 minutes that should've vanished and have a better movie to show for it. The movie is about extreme coincidences, such as a paper of numbers that indicate upcoming (well, from 1959, that is) catastrophic events that just happens to fall into Cage's son's hands. If it isn't enough that there are roughly 168 proved events on the page, they leave us with 3 'final' ones for the movie to unravel. The so-called plot attempts to intertwine religious and alien concepts together, but unfortunately anyone who's familiar with the Bible 'knows' that it's heavier on the alien side and has absolutely nothing to do with scripture. It was extremely unfortunate that every time the (2009) 'Day the Earth Stood Still' aliens showed up, I had to laugh out loud. Not to give away the ending, but it was a long 2-hours when it ended on such an easy note for what the aliens wanted. And not a huge fan of Cage's 'National Treasure' series, they were a much better viewing of putting pieces together than this lazy effort of numbers.",3,11,24,21 March 2009
Hugo," A Hugo Spectacular
","One of my favorite movies-going experiences is to go into the theatre barely knowing ANYTHING of the film I'm about to see. It's a rare occasion, since I've studied film since I was probably 10ish. With Hugo, I CHOOSE not to read too much about it and the one trailer I saw was months ago, I believe. All I heard from critics I admire, was I needed to see it in the theatre and with Real 3D. So, I went with almost zero knowledge of what I was about to see. Heck, from the preview I slightly remembered, I thought it was another Polar Express-type animated film.Wrong. On the Polar Express part, of course. Though, the opening segment confirmed what I thought I remembered – it did sure as Hades look like a CGI'd/digital world. Then we see little Hugo, all real-life like and the movie continues in the real world.Oh, and what an opening it was! Exciting, fun, adventurous, thrilling and inventive. I knew the movie was over two hours – only because I was trying to coordinate a double feature of this and The Descendants, but alas this went on far too long – and I truly believed the rest of the movie would be an amazing spectacle of lights, sounds and wondrous adventure.And then the plots sank in. Yes, I meant to pluralize that.The movie started on Plot A and that was fine, but then Plot B overlapped with Plot C, followed by D-G. I'm aware this is based on a novel, but it felt like 3 novels rolled into this one.Please don't take this as a complaint, per se, but I thought the movie worked much smoother when you have the awe of the spectacular graphics and grand sets with a simple even-kids-can-follow peaceful and harmonizing story. And because there's too much going on, too many subplots, the movie's pacing slowed to an almost halt and I started to feel every bit of the over two-hour run time.Sad, I was really getting invested and would have been more alert if they saved some ideas for a potential sequel and kept it to a quaint 90 or so minutes.That all said, if you're interested, you really should see this on the big screen. It's a marvel of ingenuity and it's fully worthy of a Best Cinematography Award. The performances are outstanding at times and the touching transformations (in some of the plots I favored more) were nice and heartfelt. And finally, there was some pretty good comedy that made me laugh out loud, mostly from Sacha Baron Cohen.If you are ever interested in seeing this, see it now. In the theatres, in Real 3D. You wont regret the experience.",6,3,6,15 December 2011
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Talk to the hand! No, really...
","Well, so much for 'No fate but what we make.' 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' proved that we're not up to our own destiny as 'T2' proved otherwise. Be prepared for all the events in the previous installment to be thrown out the window in 'T3.' The perfect comparison is the transition from 'Aliens' to 'Alien 3.' (By the way, I don't think there's much of a coincidence that both 'T3' and 'Alien 3' are bad movies that followed part 2's directed by James Cameron; apparently no one knows how to follow him up, or even if they should.) (Spoiler following) In 'Aliens' Ripley spends the entire movie protecting Newt, Hicks and Bishop and stopping once and for all the alien race only to have 'Alien 3' open with Newt & Hicks dead, Bishop to die later and the aliens breeding again like nothing happened. 'T2' taught us, we are in charge of our future, and 'T3' says, 'nope, the set future is 'inevitable.'' And I haven't gotten to the worst aspect (even worse than the dialogue, 'Talk to the hand!'): this is one of the most pointless sequels of all time. It's almost a line-by-line, shot-by-shot remake of 'T2.' Schwarzenegger is a good T-101 sent back to protect Connor, and a liquid metal Terminator sent back to kill him. There's the daylight street chase. There's the gun round-up. The one-liners (only, in 'T3' they were extremely painful to listen to.) Etc, etc. I give it an extra ½ star for the special effects. Unfortunately everything else – the acting, dialogue, originality, inconsistencies, plot holes, laughable characters (that were supposed to be taken seriously), was so far under par, it was unbelievable Cameron even let this get green-lit. And trust me: you'll feel every bit of Hamilton's absence.",2,0,3,11 October 2009
The Shining," Get Your Shine On
","'Boyyou read my thoughts! You've got the Shinning,' says Groundskeeper Willy.'You mean: 'Shining,'' replies Bart Simpson.'Shh! You want to get sued?' answers Groundskeeper Willy.That was 1994. The Simpsons came out with their fifth of twenty-third 'Treehouse of Horror' specials. The year, now, is 2013. To this day. I've never forgotten that quote and I remember hearing it live as the fifth 'Treehouse of Horror' special aired. Whenever The Shining is brought up in my presence, or whenever I start a conversation about it, I quote those lines. And yes, with the Scottish accent for Willy and never calling the movie by any other name other than 'The Shinning.'For those as nostalgic as me, it gathers a few laughs. Mostly from myself. ButI sincerely digress. I'm here to talk about The (real) Shining. And, sadly, I cannot accomplish this without spoilers. So, you are warned.** If You Have Not Seen The Shining, or even The Shinning, then just know this: I highly recommend this movie. Watch it now. Don't wait, call out sick and get a copy. Watch it and then continue with my review. Press stop now. **Whew. I truly believe I could write a novel on how fantastic, how awesome, how truly incredible this masterpiece is. Maybe, one day I will, but for now, I will give you my basic, run-of-the-Thesar review.First, let me start off (again?) with how pleased I am that I bought this on BluRay. I had originally planned on it by setting aside April 2013 as the month to re-watch and finally review a bunch of older movies from my past and I included The Shining. You see, this was one of my first horror movies I ever saw as a kid. And I distinctly remember that I was disappointed because, and yeah, these are my words: 'Only two people died. And, one of them was the killer!'Moving right along, the last time I saw this, after several more viewings, was about 1994, I estimate. So we're talking 19 years since I last saw this and just about the same time that Simpsons episode aired. And back then, I was sadly, and unfortunately influenced by who I saw it with who said: 'It's one of those movies (that's so boring) that if you fast-forwarded a bit, you'd be in the same place as you were when you initially hit 'fast-forward.'' Due to my typical disdain for 'slow-moving' pictures, I (now, regrettably) believed him.Fast-forward, once again, to 2013 and I heard about a documentary called: Room 237. I wanted to watch that, but since it's been about 19 years since I've seen the original, why not purchase it on BluRay and revisit the classic. My eyes opened so wide during this viewing, I didn't know if they close.Any small infraction of my poor feelings about this movie was wiped clean. This isanear PERFECT MOVIE. Mood, cinematography, atmosphere, dialogue, suspense, score, acting, originality, fearit's all here. Generally, I am weary of very long movies, especially long ones that takeitslow. But, this movie never, ever, felt slow. Thanks to Director Kubrick, he moved the film along with rich dialogue, excellent scenes of the ever-so isolated Colorado hotel or score. He accomplished what Hitchcock set out to do and what M. Night Shyamalan could never touch.Now, there will be some, or possibly, many, who will compare it to the equally masterful book it's based on. I have read that incredible book, and loved every page of it and this movie, well, took themes, characters and settings, but overall, it was fairly far off target. The nice thing about judging a project on its own merit is that you can enjoy both and be honest about it. Not to mention, now you get two alternative universes to enjoy. Much like the original Star Trek legendary films and series and the updated J.J. Abrams vision. So, I like what direction Kubrick took with this story.I also love what Jack Nicolson did to the role of Jack Torrance. And both Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd were also very good, as was Scatman Crothers.Already 'off' Jack takes a job as the caretaker of the gorgeous Colorado hotel for the off-season winter and brings his 'special' son and wife in tow. Jack's excited because the job requires little maintenance and care, and he gets to finish the novel he quit his teaching job for. Onlythe isolation/cabin fever is starting to get Jackie boy a little, well, more tense.Little by little, Jack gets more stressed and agitated. More and more that 'special' son of his has visions of past guests who met unfortunate ends there, to say the least. And Mom, well, she's growing further and further concerned.See? The overall tension builds as the minutes of the film passes for all parties involved. And as more is revealed around them, the very worse things get for the Torrance's.Hands down, one of the most memorable and scariest movie scenes of my whole life was when (now-GONE) Jack breaks into the bathroom to 'teach' his wife a lesson, or final one, at least. I don't recall now, but I believe I couldn't get that image of the axe through the door, or Wendy Torrance striking back, out of my head and possibly dreams for many years. It's still enormously effective today.I literally could dissect almost every chapter on the disc and fill up volumes of my own chapters. This should be taught in film school. Each scene, each set, each line, each facial expression or, lack thereof, were all so masterfully crafted, it's good that it 'appears slow' (even when it's not) so we can sit back, absorb and understand how a real film should be made.Would I recommend this? Well, you don't need the shinning to figure out if I did.",10,0,2,9 April 2013
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Miles from the Others
","Just a quickie on Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse: once you can get past the enormously long introduction/backstory of the new Spider-Man, the movie kicks into HIGH gear and is super fun, inventive and hilarious. Also, it contained many effectively emotional scenes, gorgeous shots and creativity with the world this animated film designed.That all said, this movie felt like two complete movies jammed into one and a full 25-30 minutes could've been easily edited down. Seriously, that first half-hour was TOUGH to get through. Luckily, the reward is the rest of the film with many surprises to me and laugh-out-loud moments. Just stick with the movie and forgive the crew for not trimming this comfortably down for an easier watch.Highly recommended.",8,1,4,20 January 2019
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," Escape From Dreamworks Mtn
","Not being a fan of part one, watching 'Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa' did little to change that. Sure, some of the scenery and computer graphics were excellent, and some of the heart-felt moments were nice to watch, but overall, it seemed I was not the target audience. I would solely recommend this to families, especially with children 3 on up, though it did touch on more than half a dozen or more subplots that might confuse some kids. Once again, the (unfortunately few and far between scenes involving the) penguins and the monkeys were the highlights and the low point included the familiar 'Friends' Ross character (now computerized.) David Schwimmer, my least favorite on the NBC show, can't seem to, well, escape that role. All 'M:E2A' really did for me was miss the magic and wonder of 'Disney's The Lion King' as there are more than two dozen similarities in this feature. Sad, 14 years have passed, and nothing Dreamworks can come up with can come close to the masterpiece 'Lion King.' I guess they were aiming for the dumbed down, toddler-joke version. For that, they hit the bull's-eye.",4,1,5,27 December 2008
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," No Fate did others create
","It's a rarity that a sequel actually outshines its predecessor. Yes, James Cameron was allowed a budget for 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' due to his own success, as well as the cult following part one had. But, he didn't stop at simple special effects. He took his original, interesting and origin story and blasted it in fast forward, excellently. Hamilton apparently refused to return unless her character expanded, and it did, tenfold. Schwarzenegger was given more lines, most hilarious, and a lot more in depth was his cyborg. Also, was the addition of excellent acting of Morton, Patrick and soon-to-be notorious Furlong, a full-length story of his own origins. Not only was 'T2' a perfect summer movie, not only did it surpass the original, it is absolutely one of the best action movies of all time. And, like part 1, it's mostly about the story and acting. I cringe at most so-called 'action' movies of today (SEE: 'Transformers' 1 & 2. Sure there's FX to spare, but where's the story? Where's the acting?) This movie, a continuation of part one with Sarah, now the mother of the future resistance leader John, protecting him (or is he protecting her?) while a new duo of terminators sent back in time to protect and/or destroy. They up'd the ante for action, dialogue, comedy, score, suspense, heart with special and original effects – this one set the 'liquid metal' stage. I can go on and on, but seriously, this is what real big budgeted movies should model themselves after. First, get a great and original story. Then hire accomplished actors who can, yes, act. Next, employ real FX-experts. How hard of a code is that? I truly believe parts 1 and 2 are a complete story. It should've ended here.Side Note and Spoiler: Though I loved the deleted and reinserted closing with Grandma Conner and Senator Conner playing in a no-war zone decades later, it was the most unrealistic aspect. For, how could those two ever expect not only to make it out of the events of 'T2,' despite the humanitarian efforts, without being completely hunted or on the FBI's most wanted list? We must of missed the President's pardoning and the American's forgiveness for John to become a Senator. Only in Hollywood.",9,7,10,2 October 2009
Salt," Please Pass (on) the Salt
","Where Knight and Day actually did have intentional laughs, Salt produced more laughs that I didn't anticipate. Namely in the finale. Pretty much that was the only unpredictable factor in a movie with a climax that will go down in history as one of the most foreshadowed 'twists' from minute one in the film.Aside from the literal laugh-out-loud final 20 minutes, I don't think there was a scene in Salt that was crafted to invoke any laughter. This movie is as straight-laced without an ounce of humor, or humility, as one can make it.Furthermore, aside from the unpredictable comedy and the predictable outcome, let's get one thing straight: if someone compares this to ANY of the Bourne movies, ask them this one simple question: What else have you lied to me about? This is as much Bourne as Ramona & Beezus is about lesbian lovers.The title belongs on the popcorn you are eating as this is the main definition of a 'popcorn movie' or Leave-Your-Brain-HOME film. Sure Angelina looked great and the action appeared to be CGI-lite – a favorite of mine, but it's hard to get past how incredibly mediocre both the script and action scenes were.Perhaps they were trying to be realistic. They failed there with Salt's (Jolie) truck hopping, or lack of motion sickness after getting out of the 15th vehicle she caused to drop 1+ stories. Perhaps they were trying so hard on 'making you think' with the is she/isn't she a single or double agent. Again, they let us down due to all the blatant clues they LITERALLY told us. I wouldn't be able to get through an entire season of the excellent 24 if they gave away 1/100 of the plot points in hour one as this did by minute five.US-CIA Agent Salt was rescued by her husband Mike (Diehl) while tortured by the enemy and after that nearly, but not completely, pointless plot point, they fast forward two years to their happy home in D.C. This is all fun and games until a defective Russian confesses she's a Russian spy and her own kind turns on her.Hold it there. I'll admit, I don't work for the CIA. I've not been known for my espionage tactics. But, it did sound a little fishy that one unknown would unravel an established agent in seconds and no one believes her. I couldn't buy that, but I'll just chalk that up as one of the many weak plot points to move the story to what it's really about: The Chase.This is where people might compare this to Bourne as she's being chase by the same branch and she's out to solve her dilemma on her own. Well, that's been done dozens of times before. Jack Bauer, James Bond, Dr. Richard Kimble, to name a few. What the movie Salt needed to do, was separate itself, I don't know, with some original and exciting action sequences and less on trying to trap us in who's the mole.To sum it all up, a Russian spy is, in fact, out to kill both the Russian and US Presidents and since Salt is their only suspect, they void any search of any other assassin. Could the culprit be pulling a Skynet? Sorry, I forgot to say SPOILER ALERT, but if you didn't see that coming or who's really responsible, then congratulations on your first movie you've seen since E.T.Again, I'll admit Angelina looked wonderful, but this wasn't her day in the acting part. She was so up and down with real/fake emotions, she either made the director look bad or she took lessons from Megan Fox.Every once in a while a movie will change my mind on an actor, much like my distaste for Nicolas Cage was thwarted a bit in Kick Ass or my annoyance with Adrien Brody was lifted in Predators. Didn't happen here with the actorI'veneverliked: Liev Schreiber. He didn't do anything, quite literally, in this movie. He was flat-lining out of the gate and did nothing to add to his character or movie. He was like Keanu Reeves who can tell you he's an FBI agent or he's a vampire hunter, but we never believe him due to his poor acting.Who am I fooling? This movie's premise is just that, to fool you. It's not about acting, depth, originality or setting the bar higher. It's like an M. Night Shyamalan blunder whereas they were so concerned with the BIG surprise, they forgot to make a movie.I'd barely recommend it for action alone and Angelia who did look good in her Matrix moves and clothes, but it's more of a rental. A cheap $1 rental. Or even on network TV in a year with dozens of commercials and scenes edited out.",3,17,36,25 July 2010
We're the Millers," Dysfunctional Family Ties
","Do not watch the extended edition. I'll start with that.We're the Millers is a hilarious (at times) comedy and this is mostly thanks to star: Jason Sudeikis. Now, I've always liked this dude, but here, as the drug dealer with a heart, he shined and almost every line he spoke was funny.But, as with my first warning, the extended cut was way too long. In my opinion, no animated, horror or comedy film should be longer than 90 minutes. Okay, around an hour and a half is okay, and the shorter the better, but none of these genres should be over two hours.That's not taking away from the pleasure I had spending time with these characters. Especially Sudeikis's David Clark who has to transport illegal drugs from Mexico into the United States. He's coaxed into it when he gets robbed and must develop a cover of a family holiday with more misfits in order to live.Naturally, with most comedies, there are the clichéd antics, live-and-learn drama and obvious traps the characters fall into, but these guys and chicks do keep it lively. While not perfect, the specific scenes, that should be cut away as great YouTube clips, make up for the formulaic plot.Recommended as it's harmlessfor those with an open mind. And besides, as a fan of Parks & Rec, you gotta love Nick Offerman in this.* * * Final thoughts: OK, fine. I watched it only for the advertised 'Full Frontal Male Nudity' scene involving the boy. In my defense, I knew he was of age and kinda cute, in his nerdy way. Naturally, a two-hour film is not the most efficient way to see a guy's junk, but it certainly was a bonus to wait for it. Mercifully, it's a very funny and enjoyable film regardless of my initial intentions.Really final thoughts: The best scene, by FAR, was the 'You know what I'm sayin'?' scene. I absolutely HATE that filler phrase: 'You know what I'm sayin'?' and I even associate with a guy at work that says that a lot. I tried a few lines from what Sudeikis says in this movie, but it went right over his head. Recently, I tried: 'No, I do not know what you are saying. Please state it again.' Unfortunately, that, too, went over his head. I will, once again, continue hating that stupid phrase unintelligent people say.",5,2,4,28 December 2013
Edward Scissorhands," Burton & Depp's First Cut above the Rest
","You think writer/director Tim Burton and Every(which way)Man Johnny Depp were soul mates over the years and seven movies. Here, in Edward Scissorhands, their first collaboration together, it's as if they were beyond soul matesthey are like one.Even when you get past the absolutely original and wonderful character 'Edward Scissorhands,' Burton and Depp created one of the most touching, funny, original, colorful and adventurous bedtime stories this side of The Princess Bride. But within that, there is a regret they added adult scenes – meaning a tad bit of gore and humans in peril, but also language. Other than those, this would be one-hundred-percent for all ages for all the ages. (Yeah, I'm calling it timeless, even 21 years later, it holds up today.)Oddly enough, in the 'Dr. Suess' type/50's Technicolor neighborhood created here, sits a mysterious castle that no one seems to ever visit or act curious about. Even when it's not a mile away from the other residents, but practically on top of them. Nevertheless, Peg (Wiest) does her darnedest to sell her Avon products and when all else fails, she enters the château and finds the loner – Edward, a man with scissors for hands.Kindness overcomes her and she takes him back to her home sparking the obvious curiosity of the neighborhood hens – a type of person I seriously cannot stand (more later.) Edward's mystified, curious, nervous and grateful for the attention from his newly adopted family made up of the norm: Mom, Dad, Son, Daughter, only the daughter's away.Her absence doesn't escape Edward who's definitely smitten with her from the photos. And besides, he's got the entire town of hens to woo him as he's the newest 'gossip' piece for them.It's not a stretch to see where their attention is heading, and yep, it goes southfast. Too bad for Edward – he didn't ask for this and he's obviously innocent throughout the ordeals. Meanwhile, daughter, Kim (Ryder) returns and is both suspicious and curious at the same time. Also too bad for Edward – she's got the Biff Tanner-Type Boyfriend, Jim (Hall) and he's not the sharing kind.Even mentioning the word: Frankenstein is just too obvious for both this movie and for any Burton fan. To be honest, this glorious, fun and moving picture takes Frankie to a whole new and creative level.Almost everything in this movie works: beautiful and perfect score by also long time collaborator Danny Elfman, gorgeous colors/cinematography and wonderful acting by the leads, but also the supporting cast – SEE: the always masterful Vincent Price, in his last live action role. In addition, the script is wonderful, the moods are pitch-perfect (the first snow dance and the 'Hold Me' – 'I can't' scenes get me every time) and the atmosphere is just flawless. Even when the 'starting point' idea behind the movie isn't the most original, the execution from then on was one of the most original concepts before its 1990 release year and to date.I state all these praises even when the movie wasn't 100% perfect. Burton sure loves to use those washed up old 1980s actors, such as Paul Rubens, but in this case Anthony Michael Hall. Here, he does what he needed too, but I felt he did it with a little too much push. In addition, though it was crucial to the plot, the movie contained two of my biggest pet peeves: Hens & the Media. I CANNOT stand women (or some men) who have nothing better to do but gossip, talk & create drama and attempt to drag others down to their pitiful level. Unfortunately, I deal with them in my life on a daily basis – enough I need to consistently separate myself physically from their claws. Also, the media who's only purpose is to feed both fear and additional drama into these no-life desperate housewives, while destroying anything or anyone in their path – in this case, Edward.Now, that all said – with the necessity of the evil Hens & the Media and the low point of Hall's performance, the movie still receives my highest honor of 5/5 stars. I could go on much further on how enjoyable this little tale, this brilliant bedtime story can last generationsbut just take my word for it: if you have yet to see it, go and buy it now. Don't rent, don't Netflix. Just buy. Even before you watch it; you will not be disappointed.",10,0,2,16 January 2011
Silver Linings Playbook," That's Bradley Cooper?
","If not for the terrific performances and depth to EACH character in Silver Linings Playbook, this movie would've tanked outside Oprah's OWN cable station.Okay, yes, the story is very well done, as is the cinematography, music, dialogue, etcetera, but above all else is the wonderful performance by Bradley Cooper and I never thought I would say that. I am not a fan of his; in fact, he was my least favorite character in the Hangover series. But, here, he gives the performance of his career.Notice how I didn't mention Jennifer Lawrence yet? Oh, of course, she's excellent. But, I expect that out of her. (I have yet to see her critically, and publicly, panned horror film of 2012, so in my mind, so far, that woman can do NO wrong.) Okay, I enjoyed her once again, but again, I already expected great things from her. I was shocked by how well Cooper played the bipolar hero of our story.Recently released mental patient, Pat (Cooper,) tries to put his life in order by being positive and reclaiming his lost wife at his side. All the while, he's unintentionally testing his elderly parent's (and the police's) patience with his uncontrollable outbreaks and being wooed by the great, and almost equally messed up character of Tiffany (Lawrence.)At probably too long of a length in running time, you know how this is going to pan out, but it's still suspenseful throughout because of the excellence of acting on the side of Cooper and his raging one moment to calm the next. I don't even know too many people with this problem, and yet, I know this is realism.In addition to all the greatness I've spoken about, the movie is full of heart, comedy and great strides in performances from everyone involved, including Robert De Niro, Jacki Weaver and yeah, even Chris Tucker. I did love his reoccurring character throughout.Again, it's a tad bit long, especially since the end, while thoroughly welcomed, is foreseen. Overall, it's absolutely a delight and highly recommended.",8,1,4,17 January 2013
Van Helsing," Wild Wild East
","Fun fact: the basic telephone was invented before the events in this film. This led us all to believe Hugh Jackman could have easily phoned his performance in, in-between Wolverine performances. Annnd he did.Please ignore the terrible CGI. And yeah, it's probably the worst you'll ever see. (Why oh why didn't they make this animated????!) The movie, unlike many films, actually gets progressively better.I grew up on 'monster movies.' In my household, it had to be as G-rated as possible, like the 1930's Universal monsters to the 50s-70s Godzilla films. So, it was kinda nice to rekindle with many of the bigger name Universal monsters here. With the help of a comedic-sidekick, I could make it through to the end.The Film's Title has a past he can't remember and believably, it doesn't really matter. He's just out to rid the Earth of baddies. Apparently, he's never been sent up against the original horror villain, Dracula, so let's make this movie. Oh, and he'll need Underworld, the horror version of Q and Young Frankenstein's clone to take on Bram Stoker's sorta creation of destruction. Honestly, this is good for kids. Really, really young ones. Older ones would scoff at the terrible graphics. It's not a bad movie, per se, it's just so horribly drawn due to the fifty cents spent on the special effects. Too bad...because they're laughably bad and distracting. The movie's harmless, really. It's not superior, but everyone's, well, HEART is in the right place. ***Final thoughts: A friend recommended this to me. I instantly complained on how bad the CGI was on the Werewolves. Literally, I have not seen this movie since theatres 14 years ago and that's all l I could recount. Well, that and that I thought it was just okay. Watching it for only the second time in nearly a decade and a half, I realized, it's not THAT bad of a film and there were FAR WORSE CGI shots than just the werewolf scenes. Oh, and it's more than two hours. Far too long!",5,0,2,23 May 2018
Monsters vs. Aliens," A Few Good Monsters
","What a joy 'Monsters Vs. Aliens' was. Especially on IMAX 3D, which given the choice, any movie that comes out in IMAX format and 3D, should be experienced like this. Was it comparable to 'Bolt,' 'Kung Fu Panda,' 'Ice Age' or any Pixar film? Not really, but that didn't make it any less fun, exciting, funny and a great homage to previous B-movies of decades past. There were probably 6 dozen references  you'll spend a great portion of your time counting or realizing all they're throwing at you. Or you can just sit back and enjoy the awesome 3D ride. (My recommendation, definitively see it in IMAX 3D. It's truly amazing in that format and worth the extra cost.) The actually basic premise is monsters shut away in a prison the size of Montana (or the Matrix's lair) until they're needed to defeat an alien hell-bent on retrieving an energy source that turned Reese Witherspoon's Susan into the almost-50-foot woman. The movie revolves around Susan, her new found powers/strength/height, but as usual in animation, the secondary characters steal the show. Though easily recognized by voice and humor, Seth Rogen's BLOB, er, I mean BOB was hilarious, as was Hugh Laurie's Dr. Cockroach. Kiefer Sutherland's General was funny, but seemed to remind me a lot of his life-action character from 'A Few Good Men.' Originality be damned and predictable as all Hades, I still highly recommend for all humans  it's safe for kids, and certainly entertaining for adults who remember the drive-ins of years past. (Funniest laughs involve the screaming woman at the old news reels, the evil laugh of Dr. Cockroach and any scene involving Bob or Insectasaurus. The (unfortunately only) two action scenes were inventive and extremely fun to watch, especially the Golden Gate Bridge.)",8,0,2,29 March 2009
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Witchy Women
","Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is a movie I would normally hate. Or pick apart. Or dread seeingÂ…if I was paid to review films.But, oddly, I had a tad bit fun here. And there's more than a few reasons:1. Gemma Arterton owned her Gretel role. She was fun, a little more deep than appears on the surface and commanded the screen. 2. Likewise, Famke Janssen was also pretty good. While I've always liked her anyways, she was delicious in her bad girl role. 3. The movie never takes itself too seriously. It never tries to climb above silly, period piece action. 4. While it falls apart in the (anti)climax, it has enough strong and fun scenes to carry it there. 5. Mercifully, it's Rated R. This is NOT a kid's movie and they didn't need to make it both lowbrow and for the Twilight crowd. This could've easily fallen in a trap of PG-13 crap. 6. Jeremy Renner takes his shirt off. Done.As mentioned, this movie is, in fact, silly. It's NOT to be taken a bit seriously. Its plot and plot holes weren't exactly easy to ignore, but again, let the two female leads carry you through â€“ along with a few good explosions and fun, and you'll have a good time.I grew up on the fairly basic story of Hansel & Gretel when I was a kid and loved it. And maybe this is why it was Rated RÂ…only adults my age or around my age or greater would've heard of this fairy tale. How could the young, I-Whatever Gen even hear of either Hansel or Gretel?Anyhoo, after being left alone in the woods as kids by their parents and changing the original story, Team H&G fight off their first witch and never look back. Enter present day, sorta, and a new threat of kidnapping witches brings the duo to save the day.There will actually be just a few unexpected surprises, though mostly predictable and a lot of CGI blood leading to the finale we all know is coming. One with a suspension of disbelief so great that believing in witchcraft is incredibly minor.Recommended, but know what you're getting yourself into.",5,2,3,8 June 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Tat-Two
","I'd have higher praise for the remake, 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' (6/10 Stars) if I hadn't already seen it. Shot-by-shot, line-for-line in the original Swedish version. Now, something's might have changed, and I certainly don't have the patience or time – they're both RATHER LONG (combined, they run over 5 hours) – to do a side-by-side comparison, but from what I can recall, almost zip was changed aside from the language spoken. That all said, it still was good to watch, I loved the enormously complex plot and charactersespecially the excellent character of Lisbeth. Hell, I love her character and this actress's, Rooney Mara, acting so much it's worth the second trip. I even love her character's name. But, for real movie lovers, I'd just stick with the original.",6,1,7,31 January 2012
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Catch Him If You Can
","Well, it was inevitable. Prior to this fifth installment, this was the only franchise in history that progressively got better with each film, until now. Not to say this wasn't great and on par with the quality, comedy, action, espionage, thrills, great stunts and all the other usual attributes of the series. It definitely was a fun ride.But, exactly like the 7th Fast & Furious movie earlier this year, this one seemed to tone down the looseness and fun the previous two chapters made me fall in love with. It was a ton more serious and while that made these two sequels (F&F7 and MI5) more mature and respected, it just wasn't 100% the enjoyment I had with the preceding adventures.Who cares, though? I left the theatre happy, pumped up and wanting to see this not just once more, but a multiple of times. I began my rating of Ghost Protocol with 9/10 stars, but after last night's 10th (give or take) viewing, it got bumped to 10/10 stars. I could see the same here after a few more takes. Sooo pleased they're already planning a sixth outing way sooner than the years these take to make. Until then, this one is a great addition to the series and a must-see for fans plus just about any action/spy film lover.",8,1,3,1 August 2015
Spider-Man," Who am I? The Human-Spider!
","I should really give 2009's 'Avatar' a chance. When I watched the recent trailers, the blue fish people look really fake in the trailer and it makes me either not want to see it or go for a good laugh. In 2002, I said the same thing about 'Spider-Man.' Spidey looked so fake in the trailer and the action/swinging was so slowed down, I almost didn't see it. Nevertheless, I gave it a chance opening weekend and waited a long time in line. Man, I was not disappointed. Somewhere in translation, they sped up the action sequences and you truly believed Spider-Man was swinging from building to building, fighting, etc. But, there was more to this movie, much more.Director Raimi and writer Koepp added so much depth to the characters, setting and took Stan Lee's age-old teenage comic book hero to new heights, literally. I've always loved the talent of Maguire (Peter Parker/Spider-Man) but you really felt every blow, physical or mental, he went through. Simmons (J. Jonah Jameson) and Harris (Aunt May) were absolutely perfect from the comic books I grew up on. Oh, and I always love Bruce Campbell (aside from 'My Name is Bruce') so I am glad Raimi loves to continue to use him. Unfortunately, not everyone was pitch-perfect.Dunst (Mary Jane 'MJ' Watson) was just 'okay' though she did seem to act her heart out in each scene. (Strangely, I always envisioned her with rich red and curly hair – of which neither were true, though she did have just barely a red-tint.) And what was with the Green Goblin/Norman Osborn (Dafoe)? Sure, in the 'strip he's either literally green or in a costume – I can't remember him much, he was always my least favorite of Spidey's villains. I guess they needed to upgrade to make him more believable with a horrid mask (again, I'm guess, that's the best they could come up with) which didn't make much scene, since supposedly they made the suit/mask before Osborn went wacko, and it just happened to look sadistic? At any rate, they did a fantastic job, making you truly believe in Spider-Man/Parker and all of his troubles and triumphs while keeping to the core of the always-broke, always-bantered teen who's trying to do good and always vying for the girl (MJ.) Here we have the origin story of Spider-Man, but, like 'Superman: The Movie,' you won't see the super-hero in red/blue tights until about half-way through. You'll be fully introduced to this nerd, his girl-next-door crush, his living arrangement with Aunt/Uncle and the infamous bite that spawned the teen web-slinger.Meanwhile, in the movie's weakest story, Pete's best friend's Dad experiments on himself with some green smoke that, well, uh, makes him stronger and angry. Not Hulk angry – though he's got the Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde thing going on, but just upset at those that are against the green smoke in the first place and eventually, of course, Spider-Man. This is one of the same problems I had with 'Daredevil's completely underdeveloped super-villain 'Bullseye.' You're simply asked to believe these two bad-guys have some kind of super-power and that they want to rid the city of the hero because, well, it said so in the comic books.The only other flaw I could tell (and Raimi never seemed to correct this in the following two sequels) was the length. All three movies (so far) are way too long with scenes that could've obviously been trimmed. Granted, this one is the best paced one, but standing alone, it still could've been cut easily down 20-25 minutes.Nevertheless, the movie, as a whole, is highly recommended. The fantastic score (one of Elfman's best,) graphics, dialogue, comedy, romance & longing and the setup were all great. It was a perfect introduction to the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. It can easily be viewed by all audiences, and they did a great job of making it almost virtually timeless so it can be enjoyed by generations to follow.So, thanks Spidey, you not only saved the city and the girl (oops, spoiler), but you might've persuaded me to buy a ticket to help probably the most expensive movie ever, 'Avatar,' make back at least one ticket's worth.",8,1,2,15 November 2009
Collateral," Undamaged Collateral
","It's amazing that, after eight years and the only other time I've seen Collateral, the main attention was on Jamie Foxx. And people didn't even know Tom Cruise was crazy back then!I take that back – I never bought the Tom Cruise crazy talk crazy talk. I couldn't care less what happens in his personal life. Sure I see a snippet of 'what goes on in his personal life,' much like Mel Gibson's, but who knows the real story, but for those around him and himself. Nevertheless, the guy continues to amaze and entertain me.Here, he gave once of his best performances and quickest wit and the focus was on Foxx and while he was decent, nearly great, that is, he was overshadowed big time by both Cruise and the fantastically written character, Vincent, Cruise plays.Remembering back in 2004 when I first saw this, I really liked it, and sadly gave it very little thought until a 2012 Black Friday special presented me with the BluRay for only $5. Since I liked it a lot back then, why not? Five bucks and BluRay – my favorite combo.Well, I liked it tremendously more this time than last. I will admit, the ending, or climax, kinda weakened the project, but the overwhelming positives, shots, music, score, acting and dialogue made up for the last 10 minutes or so. And furthermore, the film's premise could've died out in a few moments of screen time, and yet, it continuously reinvented itself to freshness with each transition. I loved this movie.Big time dreamer and taxi driver Max is coerced into aiding Vincent's, a hit man, night of kills.Really, that's the premise, and as thin as it is, the movie is still wildly original and is pleasantly, methodically and completely slow, and yet, suspenseful from the get-go. And this is coming from someone that both steers away from slow fare and Michael Mann directed films.Mann's sooo slow for the most part. Here, is no exception. But, with the powerful performances, excellent interactions, smart lines and ongoing build-up, I would watch this over and over.Oh, and I loved Vincent's character, even as brutal as he is, as violent as he is and as unremorseful as he is. Cruise's portrayal was a breath of fresh air eight years ago and holds up today.Highly recommended.",9,1,2,23 December 2012
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Something Wicked Finally Came
","Does this series get better and better as everyone proclaims? Well, yes and, sadly no.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban sure as hell started that way – good, that is. The film actually, for once, felt like a real film, meaning well made. Though the previous two entries were not an amateur's projects, this one showed real signs a higher talent took the wand and ran with it. The cinematography was my first indication – it was crisp, expansive and absolutely gorgeous. It almost made me wonder if Hogwart's Castle had 'magically' relocated in the year since the previous entry.That was the first sign that I noticed we were heading in the right direction. The second was a visually older Harry, inside and out. He's running thin on wonder and amazement and he's finally showing signs of frustration. Good. Let it out, Harry. But don't go all Anakin on usThirdly, with the locations, most names of creatures, teachers and bleachers (in the backdrop of the never-ending Quidditch matches) and the themes, score or otherwise, established, finally the storytelling can settle in and have fununtil roughly the last third of the movie. I wouldn't necessarily say that's 'where it all fell apart' but it was a rather tame and lame finale(s). Sure, I guess, Harry can't always thwart a giant snake (#2) or play a game of chess (#1) as the final battle, but this one – no spoilers – was so ho-hum and was completed with one of the most ridiculous final second shot of a movie that I've seen in a long time. I was half tempted to literally erase half a star from my rating for that final moment before the credits rolled. But, as much as it didn't fit and as much as I hated it, I'll just mark it as a 'WTF' moment in Harry History. (Like when Harry stole a sucker. I didn't know he was a thief. ??)Leading up to that disappointing third act, there were sure signs of the book here. Now, I haven't, nor plan to, read past book one, but the utter randomness of multiple scenes and characters indicated to me they were just trying to appease the book fans. Although, I'm sure there are a great majority sooo sad that everysingleplottwistanddialogue wasn't involved in every movie. GET OVER IT. I was ecstatic that this was the shortest one, albeit still too long at 2 hours 21 minutes and I DO NOT care to see a 6-hour miniseries of each book (or 42 hours) to ensure every single line was shown on screen.I digressOnce again, Harry's being abused by his adopted family and takes the long journey back to school after summer break. Upon arrival, once again, he's warned not to be there and once again he ignores such 'rubbish' – I'm guessing he's thinking. And finally, once again, Harry & Pals must combat a mystery/terror that threatens to shut down the most unsafe harbor of mutants since Professor Xavier's school, long before J.K. Rowling thought of Hogwarts.Sure, I made that last paragraph out to sound like a complaint, but I confess: it doesn't really bother me. I understand this is the common theme, at least from the first three chapters. What I like is, aside from the obligatory (too long) 25+ minute running time of getting him to Hogwarts, is that once there, the mystery starts sooner and sooner with each film. I'm an impatient guy and can only take so many shots of the kids learning proving to me that A: there's teachers, B: there's classes and C: there's students. Yeah, I get it: it's a school, but can we get back to what Harry needs to solve?Oh, and I also understand we need comic relief, but I've never been a fan of the Three Stooges. The appropriately named Ron Weasley is definitely one of the three stooges and is completely useless. It's painfully obvious that Harry won't be dating miss know-it-all, Hermione, but it's still best they drop him like a bad spell.I know, I know, all of this sounds like criticisms. Allow me to backtrack – for the first two-thirds, I did enjoy this feature and I liked the addition of David Thewlis and I always like both Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid and Albus Dumbledore – although, Richard Harris was much better in the first two.As much as I wanted to proclaim this series has 'increasingly gotten better' when it was about an hour over, it was that dreaded middle-of-the-road final act that lowered my score to make it actually slightly dip in quality from Harry Potter #2. I said slightly as I still awarded both 3/5 stars.Here's to Gobleting some Fire for the next movie(Editor's Note: I decided to listen to the masses for this Harry POTter phenomena and revisit the series. I've only seen the first two, both once and in first run theatres. Since it's been around a decade since the initial releases, I've started over with #1 and will get to what everyone calls: the better years. Cheerio!)",5,1,1,3 March 2013
Bad Teacher," Still BAD Even Off-Christmas Time
","I did enjoy Bad Teacher, more than most people and more than Bad Santa. Cameron, whom I've appreciated since her debut in The Mask, did an excellent job of showing that side of dark and selfish, yet actually human. Her character actually took what most people think, whether they admit it or not, out of the mind and into action. She actually did a bang up job, including some, albeit rare, bouts of humanity. I also enjoyed Jason Segel's character and Jason's wit throughout. Sure, overall, she is a 'bad teacher' and not recommended to stand (or bend) in front of any student or human, but it's a fun little ride when you leave your brain at the door.",8,5,8,1 December 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," The Amazing Spider-Man Movie Has Already Been Made
","I don't have an argument that Spider-Man's origin story didn't need to be remade for I've seen plenty of very decent to mediocre reboots before. But, what makes this a worthless remake was that it backtracked on all that was good before it.Heart, soul, good soundtrack, excellent score, acting, chemistry, heroism, humor and quotable dialogue were present in the original Spider-Man movies – and yeah, even #3. This movie lacked ALL of those. Heck, it even deleted one of the main characters and often hilarious: J. Johan Jameson. Shame.I was even willing to over look the obvious first hour or so that inevitably retold the same old story of pansy Parker, a love interest, the bullies, the Aunt & Uncle, the spider bite, the transformation and the first try-outs. Without anyone (and I guess me now) spoiling that, we all knew that was coming. But, what I didn't foresee was how blah it all was going to be. How boring and trite.And pleasePLEASE do not let the advertisements fool you into filling a seat for a movie you've seen before: 'The Untold Story' was about as revealing as finding out about Ellen Ripley's all-but irrelevant daughter in the director's cut of Aliens.What the movie is trying to tell us is that Spider-Man is a hero, that he loves Gwen Stacy and that, despite how great the Hulk looked in The Avengers, a giant lizard man can look real on screen using 1996's technology. No apologies: I didn't buy any one of these things the script displayed. In fact, it showed so much and yet, so much felt left out. So many story lines began and either faded or we're given half-ass explanations.Don't get me wrong; I didn't full-on hate on The Amazing Spider-Man. Of the approximately 20 minutes (of 136) of screen time Spidey was on the screen, he lookeddecent, albeit the shots still looked like deleted scenes from the previous series. And even though Tobey Maguire spun webs around Andrew Garfield's Parker, he still did a good job. I will even give it to both the script and Garfield: Spider-Man's signature sarcasm was funnier this time around.Is it redundant to give the synopsis since I already reviewed the 10-year-old original? Yes, except this time around instead of a green bad guy from Oscorp being human, this one had a green bad guy from Oscorp being a laughable CGI Godzilla offspring. Oh, and as much as I love Emma Stone, her character, Gwen Stacy, first introduced in Spider-Man 3, was so lifeless, you'd have to miss Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane.I simply cannot recommend this movie. Again, of the 136 minutes, 40 were good, but that did not outweigh the bad-3-D effects or 96 other slow-paced, unoriginal and uninspiring minutes.",3,285,462,4 July 2012
Aliens," Get Away From Her...I would've.
","There should be a rule in Hollywood. When Cameron makes a 'Part II,' that should be the end to the series as he sure knows how to complete any story with both a bang and an absolute conclusion. Want evidence? Terminator 2 was a great ending and a complete story to the Big-Screen Sarah Connor chronicles. But no, they ruined it once with Terminator 3 and further beat that horse with Terminator: Salvation.Piranha II, I've been told, isn't exactly his fault and I'm glad they did end it there. (The incredibly superior 2010 'remake/reboot' Piranha 3D doesn't count as part of that series.)As for Avatar 2: Electric Boogaloo, I sincerely hope that's the finale. But, then, I wasn't a fan of the first and probably won't see his follow-up anyways.And nowAliens solidified a story so vividly, brilliantly and completely, there should've never been an Alien3, and if you want proof: Watch this, absorb it, love it and then view just the first few minutes of Alien3 to prove it should never had been filmed.I digress; this is about the masterpiece Aliens. It's not just one of the, if not thee, best sequels ever, it's a perfect film in its own right. Much like what Cameron's ex-Linda Hamilton did to transform an already good character, Sarah Connor, into excellence (from The Terminator to Terminator 2: Judgment Day,) Sigourney Weaver also blossomed her already good character of Ellen Ripley into an Academy Award nomination (she should've won.)Beyond her awesome performance, Aliens is pitch perfect in all other categories: mind-blowing cinematography, sets, landscaping and special effects, excellent and eerie score, completely believable acting and dialogue, suspense, drama, action, adventure, science fiction, comedy (thanks, Bill 'Game Over, Man!' Paxton,) the human touch, etc. etc.I can't literally express on how this movie works everywhere.There are those out there that state the movie Alien is the best science fiction movie ever and the best in this series. I wholeheartedly disagree. Alien was the warm up for the real deal. It set the stage and introduced the characters and setting, though it was enormously toned down and 134% slower, comparatively speaking, but still: Alien gave us enough to want 10x more. And Mr. Cameron and the rest of the excellent cast & crew delivered 50x more.Stuck asleep in a cryogenic tube in deep space for 57 years (or so we're told in a dream sequence, I'm guessing we have to believe she was told that awake at some point,) alien-survivor Ripley is rescued and brought back to Earth. Incredibly, well, maybe not – we're dealing with humans here, she's blamed solely on destroying a multimillion dollar ship in order to destroy an alien no one on Earth heard scream.She's really screwed up: she's having chest-breaking nightmares, she's been demoted to working grunt jobs and she's concerned about colonists who just happened to be on the same rock where Ripley and her deceased crew intercepted the fateful signal that unleashed the first alien. Again: Humans.Now, she's coerced into returning to the lion's den, in one of the most believable reasons in movie history to get the original movie's stars back for more. In most lame sequels, you can all but see dollar signs in the original actor's eyes when they stumble back in for some more torture.She's quite suspicious, uneasy and doesn't even trust the tough marines that follow her in a rescue mission to save the colonists who failed to (surprise) report in.When they get to their (mostly final) destination, it's up to everyday woman Ripley to attempt to knock sense into the otherwise senseless brute force called soldiers. Without much time lapsing, they learn and pretty fast that, though one alien is badass and hard to take on, 600 are simply impossible. Much like the aliens are really larger versions of ants, it's relevant to say it would be easier for snail to escape an ant attack.Pretty much, I've given you the set up. There's so much more in this movienamely from the new characters – remember everyone but one died in #1? Oops, spoiler for anyone starting with just this one – and their back stories. Such as the lone/young survivor Newt (Henn,) the possibly corrupt android Bishop (Henriksen) who will become a staple for the series, the after-series, and elevate his movie status from simple B-movies and the personification of 'The Company' Carter Burke (Reiser.)Did I mention there's a special guest in the closing? Well, if you haven't seen this, but undoubtedly have seen Avatar, you'll see where Cameron got all his ideas from. Unfortunately for this next generation, the exceeding advanced Aliens proved to have not only one of the most fantastic, exciting and suspenseful conclusions on record, it really blew anything Avatar produced out of Pandora. On a related note, I remember Aliens's premiere on local TV and I was blown away they allowed the word 'bitch' in the famous 'Get away from her, you bitch!' line to still be said. And that must've been the downfall of America, right, right-wingers?AnywaysI can't say enough about one of my all time favorite films. If the original theatre version is still in your collection or that's all Netflix will carry, disregard or eliminate it from your queue. Sure, the Special Edition, the one you should see, is longer, but the motivations behind Ripley are more clearly defined and there's a cool shoot-'em-up scene that might be irrelevant, but fun to watch nonetheless.Weaver put everything into this role, made the entire experience come together and more accessible to a wider audience as I am aware most women's idea for movie night doesn't include the space-alien genre. This was thee video game movie to watch before video games became as real as they are today. This is real filmmakingnot the horrid CGI generation of today.",10,4,6,18 January 2011
Dallas Buyers Club," I'd Buy That for $400
","When I was growing up – more specifically: coming out, I saw a ton of films based on/around AIDS. It didn't help that I came out during the unfortunate AIDS boom of the early to late 1990s.I was indeed sad because I didn't have many films or media to attach onto during these troubling times. But, mercifully, I did not ever acquire AIDS. If I had, that is, I wish God would've granted me the pleasure of meeting the real leads in this fantastic film.Dallas Buyers Club showed me a completely different and (wow) thinner side of Matthew McConaughey. He lost so much weight for this role – that's obvious, but his change in character from within, his depth, his tone and stance stood above all else in this movie.Naturally, you meet this person in the beginning of his journey, this Ron played by McConaughey, and you would hate him as much as I did. But, his mercifully and absolutely joyous transformation – even when infected – is breathtaking. This man, McConaughey, will earn his first Best Actor Oscar just as much as Heath Ledger did for The Dark Knight.Now, this is not to take away from Jared Leto's fantastic performance as Ron's 'pal,' Rayon, or the other great actors in this film. Everyone did their part, as did the movie. Original, bright, fresh, engaging and thoughtful, Dallas Buyers Club surprised me and kept me going.Incredibly straight (as he will mention many, many times) electrician and part-time rodeo rider, Ron, acquires AIDS from one of his many, many female partners. After a (long) bit of acceptance and defying the odds, he becomes one of the less sought out drug-for-good dealers for the AIDS community.There are no heroes here. No one to cling to while you watch. But, there are humans. Humans that do eventually make you want to become friends with and side with. Some you want to learn more about and do better with your own life.Soon into this wonderful feature, you will forget the lead is Matthew McConaughey and know this person as Ron. Someone who was an ass, someone who is dying and someone who comes back to right his wrongs.McConaugheyyou have my vote for Best Actor for the 2013 Oscars. You better damn get it. And the rest of youyou better damn see this movie.* * * Final thoughts: I feel bad for Jared Leto. He did excellent here and in any other movie, he would shine and erase anyone else off the screen in the viewer's memories. But, McConaughey was just that good, Leto, in all his fabulousness, will just have to wait for another picture to show how good he/she is.",9,2,2,18 January 2014
Now You See Me," Now, Why Didn't I See this Sooner?
","I don't what took me so long. I really like Jesse Eisenberg, Morgan Freeman and pretty much the rest of the cast. I love caper tales, super human (and smart) character films and any movie dealing – even a little bit – with Vegas. Boy, was I wrongnot to see Now You See Me opening night.This movie was fantastic. Fun dialogue, adventurous scenes, great twists and served all my personal needsmeaning, I love fantasy films with incredibly smart characters – à la super human – that are always 3-5 steps ahead of their enemies. 2001's Ocean's Eleven has to be the king of all of those movies. While this one was a thrill ride and it's under that masterful film, it's still highly entertaining.Basically, four street magicians are 'mysteriously' brought together and band the enormously successful 'The Four Horsemen' magic show on tour. After a year of being a huge hit, they begin robbing places using their talents, which, of course, leads to being eyed, and chased, by the authorities. What's worse, if it could be for them, is a truly bad guy – Morgan Freeman's Thaddeus Bradley, who's stalking them and loves to expose and reveal other magician's tricks on DVDs for money.(Truly, this character is despicable. I know people do things for money all the time that's truly wrong – buying politicians, running cigarette companies, drug dealers, etc, but magic is for fun, the shows are deep and lasting amusement and you only hurt those who are trying to both make a living and entertain. This man is just plain wrong.)The nice thing – for me, at least – was that these four always 'appear' to be ahead in the game and smarter than the average beardetective (Hairy Mark Ruffalo's agent Dylan Rhodes.)Sure, these can be considered clichéd and stereotypical smart-ass characters, but I love to see super human characters on screen. James Bond has to be one of the more famous of them: Always invulnerable, always comes out on top and never ceases to throw good lines at the bad guys, lovely interests and superiors.I won't rate the movie as perfect, or even near-perfect, but I did have a great time. Even though it's magic they perform, some of the tricks even made me say: HmmmReally? And the further you get into the story, the more you can predict what the outcome(s) will be. All but one, that is. One major and final twist made me literally floored when revealed. In addition to loving super human characters, I adore at least one huge twist I never even thought about. I guess it's like being at a real magic show.Not really to be taken seriously, but just to have a great night with the moviesI thoroughly recommend this caper. See Now You See Me.",8,2,6,29 August 2013
Captain America: Civil War," Simple Bore
","Not to sound too political, but the MCU is destroying itself like the Republicans have been the same year this is released. More and more talking, arguing, internal fighting and less and less action seem to be the trademark of both the MCU and the RNC as of late. I know I am just guessing here, but this movie felt like it was 80% talk and a few sprinkled action scenes to remind us we were watching a superhero movie. Worse, it was repetitive talk. Over and over the same argument about signing an agreement so the Avengers can be micromanaged. Sorta sounds like the entire Fifty Shades of Gray movie. Luckily, this was better than that trash.In Civil War's defense, the minute action scenes were enjoyable, though nothing groundbreaking. The comedy was hilarious – thanks, Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johansson for being spot on. And the movie was well shot. No problems with the filming. Just had so many problems with the endless talking. Gosh, it felt like such a bummer to just hear and see great characters just stand around and debate all the time. It didn't help the movie went on and on and on spoiler: the title war scene takes place 45 minutes or so before the film ends, so there's so much more to endure to get to the end.Basically, 2016 seems to be the year where the good comic book characters fight themselves. This isn't just a trend; EVERYONE is doing it. Let's see: Deadpool vs. X-Men. Batman vs. Superman. Half the Avengers vs. the other half. And upcoming: Storm (at least) vs. X-men. At least the Suicide Squad members are bad to begin withIn this third incarnation of that already tired plot, Tony Stark gets confronted by a mother of one of the collateral damage, agrees with the idiot General Ross of Hulk fame and convinces half the Avengers to become babysat. Meanwhile, the other half disagrees and it mostly stems from a story of an old friendship no one really cares about. Fight, talk, talk, talk, fight, talk, fightyeah, this is sounding political. Two new characters are introduced and let me tell you: they are AWESOME. Spider-Boy (I can't simply refer to someone who looks 12 as a man yet) and Black Panther. I would actually recommend this movie on those two characters alone, if it didn't take so dang long to get to them and then they only play second – or third – fiddle to all the rest. Here's to hoping they get their own movies soonlove to just see them, even if in a double-billed adventure.But, even then, Spidey, himself, accounts for part of the script problems. He felt so forced into this script and the timeframe to recruit him to one-half of the 'civil war' doesn't make any sense. Tony is given 36 hours to find Captain America for, I guess questioning and he wastes more than a day of travelling on the chance the preteen will join them with virtually no training. (Doesn't matter, he seemed to learn all he needed to on the flight back to the war.)I digress. Luckily, it contains enough good to warrant the average rating but not enough to see it a second time. Okay, in truth, I might watch it again. Probably years from now when I do another MCU marathon or if my Dad wants to see it for Father's Day. But, it's not going to be one I will desire to see again knowing I have to spend 80% of 2½ hours with non-action/action characters plainly talking too much.***Final thoughts: Couple of spoilers here, so fair warning. Despite the evidence needed to prove one side was right and the other clearly wrong, the movie has no conclusion. You will spend 2½ hours in a film like one of those split end-series films that they broke up into two parts, such as: Harry Potter 7a and 7b, Twilight 4a and 4b or Hunger Games 3a and 3b. (I haven't seen any of the Divergent series, but I'm told they did the same.) I'm sure a Band-Aid will be placed so they can re-assemble for the Avengers 3a and 3bdamnit, they're doing it again! Anyways, it just drops off and sadly, that was very unsatisfying, especially since they already told us what's coming.Additionally, I'm told there's yet another two post-credit scenes. I am NOT a fan of these as I am usually ready to jump ship after 2½ hours once the real movie ends. I did stay for the first of two since it was just a couple of minutes following the 'end' of the movie. I just didn't have the patience to sit through another 10 minutes of credits to see another 30 or less seconds. I'll just watch it online once available, which should be soon. Even if it's not, someone can just tell me what happens. I'm really not that interested thanks to their cheap trick they keep doing over and over. It's getting old.",5,12,25,7 May 2016
American History X," X Games People Play
","I wondered if I needed to see the first nine films before I started American History X to get what was going on. Turns out, this was stand alone.Hate, sadly, isn't going away any time soon in America. I could stand on a soap box and preach against it, knowing far well that I've lived in fear of people's hate against me, but it would do no good. I dream of a day that Star Trek becomes a reality and we all do 'get along.'Well over 14 years ago, a Neo-Nazi story of brotherhood, misdirection and black & white came out and I've never forgotten it.Recently, I bought the BluRay for cheap, and the movie ain't, in the slightest. It's realism, relevance and fright still holds up today. Aside from the far-too-many close-ups, this movie is beautiful, inside and out.In Edward Norton's absolute best performance to date, he plays Derek who was talked into leading a skinhead régime while his impressionable brother, Danny (Edward Norton,) is set to follow in his footsteps. Derek lands in prison for a heinous crime, one involving one of the most brutal scenes I have EVER seen in movies. There he receives life lessons that might helpand a little bit more. If only all gang-bangers could go through this.This movie is a music video of great performances and scary messages. It's scary because it's real. It may not help convert some, but I'm hoping it will even help a few. Especially with the last shot.",9,0,1,23 December 2012
Saw III," Not III times the gore: 30+
","Let the games explode. Despite liking the direction 'Saw II' took, 'Saw III' was actually an improvement over 'II.' (Still, the original 'Saw' was the best, but this is second best.) The only unfortunate thing I can report, after saying how much I liked this feature in the series, is: they didn't just take the gore to the next level, the exploded it on the screen (in some scenes, literally.) I have seen a lot of horror movies, a lot of the 'torture porn' films, slasher ones, etc, and this ranks #1 as the goriest movie I have ever seen. And that's too bad. The writing, acting, suspense, mystery and dialogue make me want to watch it, but at the same time, it's, well, 'torture' to get through. (Spoilers ahead, but only for those who haven't seen #1-2) The now established team of Jigsaw and Amanda once again take on multiple people to prove a point: appreciate life, letting go, moving on and understand forgiveness. It would take an article seventeen times this size to go through all the plot points, so, to sum it up, just read the previous sentence. Yet again, they are now falling over their so-called twists and connect-the-dots and once more they are prepping the audience for more 'Saw' chapters. Unfortunately, they should've ended it right here. (See the closing, forget the cliffhangers and you'll see why this would've been a wonderful closing.) I did really like this installment, but sadly, this will probably be the final viewing (of 3) I will have of it. The gore is really in excess here, and the one test towards the end, involving literal 'twists' is the most gruesome of all (five, to date) 'Saw' films and probably one of the most heart-wrenching to see in any film.",8,0,1,26 September 2009
Ocean's Eleven," Are you in or out?
","I actually do like a lot of rebooted/remakes, such as Dawn of the Dead, Halloween or Star Trek. But, of course, for every three that are good, a dozen or more are mediocre at best. That's not the case here.Granted, I have not seen, nor really desire to see the original Ocean's Eleven, after what I read and researched about it. I'll just take this movie at face value.More than just a remake, this movie ranks HIGH on my all-time favorites list. I have probably seen it twice the number in the title and plan on more visits to one of the most creative, funny and just plain entertaining movies I have ever seen. It helps that I am a George Clooney, Julia Roberts and Matt Damon fan and I can enjoy Brad Pitt and Andy Garcia from time to time. But, put all of those, plus a lot more, together and you have probably the highest level of chemistry between any casts in any movie.Ocean (Clooney) is released on probation from jail and first things first: he starts high-rolling his latest heist scheme by rounding up the usual suspects through his buddy, Rusty (Pitt.) Their diabolical plan is to rob three Las Vegas casinos in a single night, all from the same vault under the Bellagio. To do so, they need (almost) a dozen men and everything to go as planned.That's the basic premise, but there is so much more richness to this movie that causes oodles of repeat watching.Number one: Even though the chemistry is pitch perfect across the board, even involving enemies, its Clooney and Pitt that make this jump three levels. Their banter and understanding of each other while finishing each other's thoughts and sentences hasn't been seen since the 1950s. Usually that involved Cary Grant and a various female lead. Here, sexuality aside, these two cats had it down. They added humor, pose and you rooted for them every step of the way, even though, in reality, they're the bad guys.Number Two: The remaining cast was excellent. Each held their own, each had their own depth. Not two alike. Damon was great as the nervous and up'n'coming'thieving Linus, brothers Virgil and Turk were played hilariously by Caan and Affleck and Jemison played the computer nerd wonderfully. Those are just four. Mark my words: EVERY SINGLE actor in this film was perfect in their respective roles. I could go on another 1,000 words on each one and not do them the justice they did for themselves.Number Three: It's pure fantasy. I consider myself somewhat a Vegas Expert – I've been following, studying and visiting Sin City since I was about 13-15. THIS COULD NEVER HAPPEN. Even if one aspect of their master robbery plan would partially work, it would be thwarted in seconds. And that's part of the fun. You know this is unrealistic, yet, we're so drawn into it, it's extremely enjoyable. That's due to (#4 below) the dialogue and character depth that acts as a (no coincidence) diversion to the improbability of what's happening on screen.Number Four: The dialogue was original, deep, snappy and quotable from line one. Speaking of which, those first two words spoken, by both the probation officer and repeated by Daniel Ocean, 'Good Morning' seriously became my tagline, no matter the time of day. I would walk into Santisi Brothers, my local pub and watering hole for going on ten years and tell my favorite waitresses 'Good Morning.' I did it so much, that I didn't catch myself sometimes and some newbie's would tell me it was evening. I always replied, 'It's morning somewhere.'I mention that story because this movie had such an impact on me, it became part of my subconscious. Oh, and there's plenty more lines I absolutely love: 'Whiskey. And whiskey.' 'I only lied about being a thief and I don't do that anymore. – Steal? – Lie.' 'All reds!' There's more than a hundred more. Admittedly, some still go over my head including ones about the caper lifestyle I'm not familiar with. Though I can't necessarily follow what an 'Ella Fitzgerald' is, it just proves how brilliant this movie is. (And no, I refuse to Google it. I love my ignorance and the movie's intelligence.) It's nice to revisit a movie and either hear/catch things I haven't before or enjoy the dialogue I did.Number Five: I get cranky when it comes to Vegas-Themed movies. They rarely get it right – Con Air and 21 being the most offensive and misappropriated views of the city. This movie got it right. And it was gorgeous. Though now a (only a tad) bit dated – it's 9 years old, after all, it still captures the essence of the beautiful strip, inside the casino and out. It doesn't just take the finale in front of the Bellagio water fountains to tell you: they knew Vegas.Number Six: Simply intelligence. This script was perfect. Rarely will I encounter such a well written, well rounded script from minute one to the end where they introduce Julia Roberts. Everything worked here, from dialogue, to interactions, to tension, to comedy. In a word: masterpiece in writing.If you have yet to experience Ocean's Eleven, you are missing out on a modern classic. Whether or not you like George Clooney or Bad Guys as heroes, you will love this. This worked in 2001 and will be timeless enough to be shown in 2050 and have the same impact.

The Conjuring 2," Superior Superstition
","Wow. I cannot believe I am saying this, but this 'ghost' story is one of my favorite horror movies in the past several years.I'm not a fan of ghost stories/haunted house tales. Maybe it's a Catholic thing. No offense to the followers or religion itself, but perhaps the reasons why Priests and the Catholic Church are brought up in so many haunted flicks, these kinds of 'true stories' hit closer to home to that faith. Maybe, that's why so many followers are scared of these possession flicks.Personally, I don't believe in the roaming spirits, so I am not frightened by any of these types of movies, including this one. But, I do believe in trying to broaden my horizons. So, a few years ago, I gave the infamous ghost trilogy a shot. These included the most popular haunted movies: The Conjuring, Sinister and Insidious. Truthfully, I wasn't a fan, myself, of any of the three, and most of them blended in so much I couldn't tell you which was which.That said, I do recall I cared a tad bit more for the Ethan Hawke one. I believe that one was named Sinister. That one I did like, but only a bit more than the other two. Since, again, I'm not on board with these supposedly 'true' event films, I ended my open-mindedness with the originals. I wasn't about to waste my time with the sequels or spin-offs when I knew I would never fully enjoy them.This ended now. I was convinced by a friend and enormously high ratings for The Conjuring 2 to finally sit down and watch it. By far, it surpassed its original tenfold and the other two tremendously. In fact, I can safely say, this, 1408 and original Blair Witch Project are my favorite intentionally scary ghost movies.The Demonbusters of the 70s are back to co-investigate an English Estate that may/may not be possessed and if spooky, the Catholic Church might step in to help. But, they might be too late by then.Boy, did I summarize this movie with zero spoilers. I am proud of myself! But, it was easy. This movie is pretty straight-forward in regards to synopsis. The real meat of the experience was the acting, the heart and depth of the characters. That was one major positive.The other for me was the fact that what started off as yet another clichéd, by the book haunted house movie quickly turned into a real movie, an original take and ghosts that freaking did stuff. Most of it blew me away and I liked the ghosts out of the shadows. Finally! It wasn't a movie so reliant on showing barely any movement until the end.Sure, they say 'less is more' in horror, but damnit, that's so overdone by now. I really want to see something. I want the other characters to see the same thing, as well. And this movie delivered in spades after about 20 minutes or so. The action, if you can call it that in this kind of film, was well thought-out and inventive. The characters, namely our favorite Demonbusters, made us really care about them. And the ending was exactly how I wanted it to play out. (Selfish, but that's what I like to see and not the same ole finale most horror filmmakers think is still original and wanted.)Not only would I recommend this movie, I would just say skip that Ghost- Trilogy I spoke about and just watch this. Again, I can't speak for the almost countless sequels and spin-offs, but I can say this beats any 'original' any day of the week.***Final thoughts: Chris. You owe me a new phone. No. You know exactly what I am talking about. Pay up.",8,0,0,30 August 2016
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Oh! Does he wear glasses?!
","Scott decided to come out to the world during the worst possible year. The general public, rightfully so, was so put off by such idiocy thrown at us this year, that many stayed away from the little films that, in the creativity field, dominated the large pieces of crap. Too bad.First they missed the great Kick-Ass, followed by Michael Cera's other wonderful release: Youth in Revolt. Come to think of it, one of the best comedic talents we have out there barely has a hit to his name (aside from, maybe Superbad) and that's regrettable. Just as nowadays we not only hardly have any music group that has multiple #1 albums, like in the 1990s and before, we have too few great and talented stars, like Cera.I could say SEE: Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World a hundred times, and just about no one will listen. And no, it's not because I'm not a respected critic – who really is? It's probably more to the skeptic viewer who's been burned for far too long.But, at any rate: SEE THIS MOVIE. It was funny, wildly original, fantastically shot, had an awesome soundtrack and deep acting. Nicely, it took what worked with Zombieland and Kick-Ass to the next level. Heck, throw in a little of the original 1960s Batman series to boot.Scott, 22 (Cera) is a nerd and is dating a high school student until he dreams up his dream girl, Ramona V. Flowers. As always, she's got baggage: seven ex's he has to defeat to keep the girl.Okay, that's the (very) basic premise. In between, he comic-book-ish fights them with powers that no one seems to question. The bad guys fly and sling video-game flame balls and Scott equally rises to the occasion with an air knock out. While all this is going on, there's a stalking ex-girlfriend, a battle of a different sort involving a band that Scott's attached to and a gay roommate played perfectly with excellent timing and comedic lines from no other than a Culkin (Kieran.)In fact, Wallace (Culkin) was one of the best characters of the story. It's refreshing to see not only two best friends/roommates be gay and straight and even non-sexually sleep in the same bed – but also of the two, the gay friend is the dominate one. In 99.775% of all films involving the 'gay-sidekick/friend/comic relief' they're played small, weak – though sometimes all-knowing, but at the same time, it's the straight that has everything together. It's the opposite here. The only other film I can reference here was the relationship in My Best Friend's Wedding, but that, like Will & Grace, was, like always, a homosexual male and BFF female. Here we have a perfect male-male-non-sexual gay/straight friendship.But, I digress; this isn't necessarily a gay-themed movie. This is about action, romance, fantasy, a whole lotta fun and great special effects. In between, you'll meet and love Ramona who has more depth than her hair colors. You'll get inventive ways to fight each of the seven nemesis ex's. Butthat's also a complaint of the movie.Despite the comic book it's based upon, why couldn't it have been 3 or 4 ex's max? The movie dragged a bit, and though each challenge (or battle) was exciting to watch for superbly choreographed action sequences, it just kept going on a little too long after awhile.Eh, just sit through it. Have a great time. It's not for the mainstream – WAY unfortunately – but it's for those who just want pure fantasy, it's for those who grew up on both comics and video games and it's for those who truly believe the geek can get the girl. Doesn't Cera always? SEE THIS MOVIE.",9,7,22,25 August 2010
Enchanted," Well, that's not gonna last.
","It's official: I may not have a heart. All the way through 'Enchanted,' a movie I really wanted to like, I just found myself, perhaps heartless, thinking it was just 'okay.' Actually the other thought occurred to me that the movie, itself, lacks heart at times.A great concept of a film, though not entirely original (I did like 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' oodles more) the movie starts off summing up multiple fairy tales (namely, of course, Disney cartoons) and then, as the movie promotes, shifts into the real world. One by one, every 'named' character goes into New York City and then the movie lets the LEARNING begin!Unfortunately, I liked the characters in cartoonland, or Andalasia, just the way they were originally. That's their life. They're happy, they thrive, let them be. I realize the movie follows the typical American attitude: 'you need to change to our lifestyle, you need to be just like us, or you simply won't be happy until you're just as miserable as we are.' And regrettably, that is one of this movie's messages.I realize I'm the one being a cynic here, but I always have felt, if you're happy and as long as it harms no other, live and let live. What was wrong with Giselle (Amy Adams) singing, loving, dancing and generally being happy with life? Why did she have to meet the Anti-Giselle, Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and why does America, er, I mean, Robert have to drag her down to his level? Funny, he's so pessimistic throughout about true love, happily ever after, that when they (PREDICTABLY) get together 'for good,' all I could say is, 'Well, that's not gonna last.'I know we're not dealing with realism here, and I went as far as to give Giselle the benefit of the doubt and thought it was plausible for her to call upon the creatures to help her clean in the real world. But, what I couldn't get past was the song/dance Central Park number. Did she control them as well? Did she feed them their lines, telepathically? Yes, I understand the art of musicals, especially Disney's musicals, but they tried so hard to make sure we know this is the real world, I figured that's the direction the movie was going. If they just wanted to make her Mary Poppins, so be it. I wouldn't have blinked when she called upon the animals or the Prince that seems to have money coming out of his pockets to suddenly buy food at will or stay in a hotel. But, that's not the direction the movie seemed to be going. 'Wake up, Sleeping Beauty; this isn't a fairy tale anymore.'Okay, I'm not totally without a heart. There were a lot of scenes I really enjoyed, including Disney actually and for once, mocking its own creations, stockpiling on the advertisements and duplicating a lot of the scenes of the Disney movies we've grown up to love. I also liked some of the songs, always adore the wonderful Susan Sarandon, I loved the heart Giselle had (until she became American) and I actually did like the little chipmunk, Pip, especially how his voice vanished once in NYC. In addition, I liked the whole concept of the film, bringing the clichéd Disney cutouts to the real world and how they would really react. And despite the sometimes mixed messages, it might be pure enough for the kids, aside from the somewhat violent ending (typical closing of a Disney cartoon, but this was real life.)Speaking of the finale, the movie was already longer than it needed to be, but they seemed to wrap up everything fairly quickly. I wasn't too pleased with how everything went down, including all the humans suddenly accepting everything, including one character literally jumping into Andalasia without a slight thought, changing that person's character in a heartbeat. I guess they had to just wrap it up afraid kids might not stay with the story for two hours.Uh, 'Harry Potter' is over two hours and kids are on the edges of their seats every minute. Hey Disney, if you have a good enough product, you won't lose your target audience. Just have a little faith. And a little heart.",3,3,8,16 February 2009
Die Hard 2," Jack Bauer Dies Harder
","I remember easily comparing 'Die Hard 2' to 'Indiana Jones 2'; both are inferior sequel to the classics they followed and definitely less than the installment that followed. But, after watching again, believe it or not, 'Die Hard 2' really wasn't that bad. It appears they simply made it as a big summer event movie, with comedy, homage to the original, action, explosions and blood. They succeeded. Unfortunately, it doesn't touch the original 'Die Hard' (nor part 3 or 4), but in its own right, it's still worthwhile. Of course, you have to let a lot of suspension of disbelief go – he jumps on a plane (for the first time, that is) and fights on the wing in transit, for Pete's sake. But that's part of the 'Die Hard' mythology: crazy NON-CGI stunts – like the good ole days. But unlike current action flicks, i.e. 'Wanted', the 'Die Hard' movies had heart, character depth & development, funny dialogue, real-life action sequences that took time & not computer space and a true action hero, Bruce Willis. Not that this movie is perfect, by far its not. It's just entertaining, fun and exciting – if you just let yourself be entertained. Unfortunately, if you don't get the 'BIG SHOCK/SURPRISE' the first time, it's so painfully obvious the second go-around. And that is definitely the movie's biggest flaw. Well, that and today, in 2009, it's also terribly blatant it was filmed prior to 9/11 – anyone seems to bring weapons aboard a plane or even smoke anywhere they please in the airport. This time, John's waiting for his wife in their newly reconciled partnership to land in DC, and surprise, terrorist attack to release a captured General. John fights back. By far not the best 'Die Hard' but still its fun and worth a watch.",7,1,3,15 May 2009
Avengers: Endgame," Kill Thanos Vol. 2
","Thank God I *didn't* see this on Thursday night like I originally wanted to. Man, did I feel every...single...one of those 181 minutes.Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie. Some scenes were definitely funny, some touched me tremendously and I had a huge warmth in my heart for nostalgia for the other MCU chapters. But, boy...one full hour could've been cut and the tightened film would've been so much better.My father, who joined me during this film, had not seen Avengers 3a (ah-hem, 'Infinity War.') So, before this 3b part (aka: 'Endgame,') I took roughly 10 seconds to explain that first part to this conclusion movie. I summed up 2½ hours of footage...in 10 seconds. He didn't think it sounded like a good movie, to which I corrected him. Part 3a was a great movie and you never felt those 2½ hours because it was chock-full of action, almost non-stop. Just because it had a basic premise, it still had depth and so much going on, you should be on the edge of your seat the entire film.And the opposite is true here. This is what I recall feeling when I watched Kill Bill Vol 2. I was so excited because Kill Bill Vol 1 was so action-packed and fun, I was looking forward to the same in the concluding volume. Nope. The breaks were put on from like 90mph to 15.Again, don't get me wrong. I really did enjoy both Kill Bill Vol. 2 and this Avengers 3b movie. It's just not what I expected in the least. It's definitely well made, thought out and has all the elements you desire. It just takes such a long time to get the goods. And by goods, I'd say, aside from all the one-off great scenes of comedy/reminiscence, the climax had me almost out of my seat, clapping and cheering.The neat part of this experience was the aftermath. Rarely do we get to see the actual destruction after an evil villain actually succeeds like Thanos did in Part 3a. 3b is that movie. This is the What-If-Comes-Sadly-True. And I enjoyed that idea a bit until the movie finally kicks in - about an hour or so in.Not gonna ruin any specifics, but suffice to say, the movie's, naturally, about the Avengers attempting to figure out how to win after the last movie's defeat. Kinda like Return of the Jed-I to The Empire Strikes Back. (Though...Star Wars Episode VI does a much better job of the same story.)Is this a recommendation? Of course. Go and slam your money down and get a ticket. There is absolutely zero reason to NOT see this if you've seen Part 3a or, hell, any of the other MCU. But, maybe just once. Okay, twice, with the second time at home to catch anything you might have missed. And keep in mind, overall it's best to have seen ALL 21 prior movies to really appreciate/understand this one.***Final thoughts: Whew! I think I did it. I think I wrote a completely spoiler-free review. These kinds of movies takes me off social media the whole week leading up to my weekend viewing as I am worried about spoilers. I guess, you're welcome.",5,19,47,27 April 2019
Dirty Dancing," Each Dance is The Time of My Life
","Despite my high rating (5/5 Stars) for Dirty Dancing, I admit: it's a guilty pleasure.Sure it's not perfect. Sure, some lines could be considered 'clichéd' and the movie's not that unpredictable. But, it's my life. Literally.No, no one calls me baby, or puts me in a corner – I do that very well on my own. But, I grew up on this flick after my sister, who was the world to me growing up, introduced it to me. Since then, I've probably seen this roughly 34 times. And each timeit gets me.The songs – oh, God, the fantastic soundtrack, the love – proved very well by the wonderful acting of Jennifer Grey as Baby, and the comedy – I still laugh at the jokes, comedic scenes and the silliness portrayed by the boss's son, Neil (Lonny Price) and Baby's sister, Lisa (Jane Brucker.)In my traveled opinion, this movie is an absolute timeless classic. No copy, including the (still unseen by me prequel) can touch it or move me like this movie does. And even the by-a-mile foreseen finale lifts me each time. Yeah, even with what some (not me) would consider the corny line to get Baby onto the stage and away from the judgmental father, Jake (Jerry Orbach.)Setting the movie back in the 1960s was clever. For one, it was a good way to make this movie timeless to avoid the typical 80s haircuts, outfits and attitudes. Also, it got to introduce black-jacketed Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze), a (fairly decent) character. A new 'Fonzi' (Henry Winkler in Happy Days) or 'Danny Zuko' (John Travolta in Grease), if you will.Daddy's little girl (Baby) gets a little too curious at a summer retreat when she gets bored and meets the dance crew of the resort. All but immediately, 'Miss Fixit' gets involved in trying to help Johnny's (the dreamboat of her affection) dance partner, Penny (Cynthia Rhodes), with getting an abortion. With a little hesitation, Penny accepts the help (cash from big daddy's wallet) but this sets off a chain of events.Number one: inexperienced dancer Baby must replace Penny in a gig at a local hotel – enter in dance-instructor Johnny and let the sparks fly. Number two: the abortion from the backdoor doc nearly kills Penny and Daddy must intervene when he originally didn't know where his money went. And number three: Though Baby did nothing officially wrong, Daddy's trust in his #1 child (shhh, don't tell the idiot sister) has been waned.Will Baby set things right with Daddy? Will Baby grow up to be with Johnny? You'll just have to tune inas if you haven't seen this movie before. If you ever wanted to, you have, at least a dozen times. Or if you're the football lovin', macho male who despises 'chick-flicks' you really should put down your guard and see this one of a kind film.One of a kind is right. Aside from Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and the more recent Dancing with the Stars, you can only really enjoy Jennifer Grey here. Her acting was spot on. Her subtle glances have me rolling, but deeper, they're very true to her character. It's what a lot of us go through.And too bad for two of the leads who are no longer with us. The extremely kind-hearted Patrick Swayze was very good for his roll, not to mention danced awesome (with a little help from the equally impressive Cynthia Rhodes.) Also, Jerry Orbach was perfect for what he needed to be as Baby's daddy.While the rest of the cast was great for comic relief or additional (and superb) dancing, the cinematography was wonderful, the editing great and as already mentioned: it had one of my favorite soundtracks. One song in particular – She's Like the Wind was sung (and (co-)written!) professionally and beautifully by none other than Mr. Swayze, himself. The music was so abundant and fantastic, they needed to add a 'More Dirty Dancing' soundtrack. Though, not as great as the original, it's a certainly necessary addition to any fan's collection.This movie should also be featured on the AMC's Movies That Shook the World collection/TV series. For, it had its share of controversy – Ooohhhthey really are DIRTY dancingPER SHAME! and check out Baby's age in comparison to Johnny's. Also, it spawned a completely unnecessary prequel – again, I haven't seen, so I will try to keep my judgment out of it. However that turns out, this is a heartwarming and complete story. No need to go expand or see what happened beforehand. And finally, it should be labeled as influential for the spinoffs (as most movies don't get that far): the short-lived TV series and the stage version. If I remember correctly, they once toured here, in Phoenix, for the AZ State Fair in the 1980s.Dirty Dancing is a must see. Period. It won't change the Earth, it won't cure cancer and it's certainly a 'leave your brain at the door'/guilty-pleasure film. But for film lovers, true movie connoisseurs, you have to watch all types of films and this 1980s classic absolutely should be on your list.",10,1,1,6 February 2011
Quantum of Solace," Bond 2: Electric Boogaloo
","Having the rebooted James Bond series, 'Casino Royale,' become my favorite of all Bond movies, it was going to be tough to follow it up with the first direct sequel: 'Quantum of Solace.' At first, I didn't like it, hardly at all. The plot was all over the place – OK, I admit, I really couldn't follow it, the first go-around, there were a lot of dry scenes, and the rejuvenated Bond took leaps backwards with his sexual encounter with a 'Strawberry Fields.' My second and now third viewings, I enjoyed it a lot more. I suppose its one that grows on you. Sure, nowhere near as good as 'Royale,' heck, not in the top Bond films, but still enjoyable.It's 10x more gritty and dark than 'Royale,' yet I loved the feel and style of the film. Thankfully, they did fix one of 'Royale's biggest problems by shortening this down 37 minutes. Also, the cinematography, landscapes, locales, fight scenes were all well done.The yellow-toothed villain left a lot to be desired, and even though they needed to give the audience the typical Bond Bimbo, I still cringe at reducing this mature Bond to a 15-year-old.Taking place within the hour of the 'Royale' finale, Bond is bent on revenge (despite his consistent attempts to state otherwise) and in turn taking down the big-evil corporation known as 'Quantum.' You don't get the whole story on them, so I suspect this isn't the first sequel to be made in the Bond movies, though I wish it were. Move on. Get Bond back where he needs, fresh missions. (I think they did state that's where it's going in the final shot.) I liked the song, though, listening to it outside the movie, it seemed very edited in the title sequence. I still think the story has a lot to be desired, but still recommended for action/suspense buffs.",7,2,5,19 September 2009
Independence Day," ID4ever will watch this movie
","First impressions rarely let me down. Rarely.Picture it, way back in 1996, Cine Capri in Phoenix, AZ, I first watched Independence Day andhated it. I went with two buddies, one of which said afterwards that it was realistic portrayal of the aliens. I said, 'In movies? Or (pointing) up there?' He confirmed he meant from above. Sheesh. Eh, to each his/her own, but I didn't (at the time) find anything realistic about it.It was the second time I saw this, however, that grabbed me and opened my eyes to the best big-budget-B-movie ever made up to that point. And that's exactly what it is: a B-Movie with a Budget. It took elements from practically every MST3k-mocked mid-20th Century alien invasion story, but added the element of excessive funds.Further review of this movie, it also added hilarious lines, decent acting and state-of-the-art (EVEN by today's standards, 14 years later) special effects. So, you must know, this is the ultimate leave-your-brain at the door movie. Sit back and have a roaring time.Impatient people do not have to wait long for the movie to kick-start what it's here for; the alien mother ship makes it's 'Star Wars' entrance seconds into the feature and all hell breaks loose first in the US government, but then the world as smoky-fire clouds reveal the 'baby' 15-mile-wide ships over the world.Bam! Start the soap opera list of stars from various parts of the US. We've already met Constance (Colin) and President Whitmore (Pullman) in D.C. but then there's his First Lady Marilyn (McDonnell) in L.A. who shares the city with couple Steven (Smith) and Jasmine. NYC holds David (Goldlum) and Dad (Hirsch) – not to mention the hilarious Marty (Fierstein) who, instinctively cares for his mother and lawyer. For good measure, throw in crazy Russell (Quaid) who, not to really spoil anything, acts like Cartman from South Park episode one. There'll be more, but, I believe the movie revolves around this already extended cast.Unlike most disaster/end-of-the-world films, this is the best cast ever assembled in this particular genre. Unfortunately, even though I really did like the actors and their characters and felt the chemistry was perfect, that statement isn't saying much. Take Director/Producer/Writer Emmerich, since he happened to direct this one. Three of his follow-ups had so many big names and so many disappointments that I hardly cared enough about them to mind if they perished prior to the big and clichéd finales. 2012, 1998's Godzilla and The Day After Tomorrow were all sub-par to painful and each and every character was so one-dimensional and thoughtless, we lost a lot of what those movies were all about: hope.Don't get me started on the other Emmerich comrade, Michael Bay, and his terrible list of both movies and assemble of way below average characters: Pearl Harbor, Transformers 1-2, The Island and A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010.) (Personally, I didn't like Armageddon, but at least he had one-two worth rooting for in that disaster film.)At any rate, I loved the characters in Independence Day, but the true stars of the film was the special effects and tongue-in-cheek dialogue. After you get to know the different personality and employments of the actors, the rest of the movie is a just plain roller-coaster of aliens trying to eliminate us, humans failing at eliminating them, an actually plausible and believable love story and, of course, the kick-ass, though obvious FIGHT-BACK finale that does NOT disappoint for a single second.I'm a score-man. I love a beautiful and relevant instrumental background music track, and this movie's got a great one by David Arnold. It's not only action-packed and has elements of perfect Sci-Fi moments, but the number one quality it had was: HOPE. The movie centers around humans (FINALLY) banding together, putting way 'petty differences' (LOVE THAT LINE) as spoken by the President in a great motivational and human speech, and the hope we have to survive. Truly, I love a score that through no spoken words, speaks tons for the movie, and mood, at hand.I've already mentioned how I liked the cast, but I'd like to focus in on some of my favorites. Back in the mid-1990s, it was unquestionable that the summers belonged to WILL SMITH. Bad Boys, Independence Day, Men in Black, heck, even some unfortunate fools went to see Wild, Wild, West. Personally, I like when he actually acts and not just play 'Will Smith' but here he's at the top of his 'Hey, I'm Will Smith' game.Further, I'm a fan of Jeff Goldblum, and you kinda have to be, to like him here. He's also playing his signature 'Hey, I'm JeffuhuhGoldblum' role. He was hilarious, smart and I liked his true desire to use his talents to solve the little alien invasion problem.Mixed these two together, meaning Goldbulm's David and Smith's Steven, finally, and towards the end of the movie, it was heaven. They played off each other; two complete strangers who could both bounce off each other with 100% separate personalities, but had extreme chemistry. You almost wonder what took the movie so long to get them together.Finally, just plain see this movie, if you haven't already. It's extremely fun and even better on a big screen. In fact, this movie has been used in one of my long-standing arguments whenever I hear someone say 'Oh, I'll just wait for video.' Like Twister, Independence Day looks just, well, so small when you watch it on the television. Picture how threatening a 15-MILE-WIDE (TV Series) 'V'-shaped ship hovers over the cities as seen in the movie theater and then do the same for a 7 inch spacecraft on your TV and tell me this one was 'worth' the wait for video.",8,4,7,4 September 2010
The Butterfly Effect," Cause and Effect: Punk That!
","No, I don't have much respect for the normally ineffective Ashton Kutcherbut wow. He was literally spot-on in The Butterfly Effect.If you liked Frailty, Stir of Echoes, Se7en or Mr. Brooks, chances are, you'll like this (sorta) Time-Traveling tale of love lost, gained, destroyed, rebuilt and retribution.I loved this movie. And it held one of the best secrets I've ever seen in a movie: an (Special Features) alternative ending that equally matches the theatrical finale. Both endings actually make perfect sense and are both a great conclusion/solution to the problem at hand. My recommendation is getting the DVD or Blu-Ray that contains both and watch both.Aside from the climax, the movie itself was a fantastic and original take on the age-old Grays Sports Almanac (SEE: Back to the Future Part II) catch-22. It also seems like an elaborate set-up of what we know what's coming: a man traveling back/forth in time to 'correct' problems to set the future right. (Also SEE: 'Year of Hell,' the best Star Trek: Voyager episode.)It's not a 'boring' and 'long intro' after all. After multiple viewings, which you should, you'll pay closer attention to details to the younger kids as they grow and suffer until the story shifts to 'the present' and Evan (Kutcher) attempts to wrong the gaps of his memory loss during traumatic times in his childhood.Evan has had some bad experiences as a child, and lucky or not, he's blacked out for most of these. Fortunately, he had one doctor that encouraged him to write a very detailed journal. Evan uses these later in life to somehow magically transport him back into the kid he was during the life-altering bad times.Unfortunately, as the movie's title indicates – for those who know the 'legend' of the light-winged beast – every step he takes 'back-in-time' causes further complications in the future.That's a really basic summary of the plot hereand I'm glad to report that. There's so much more here. Deep performances, namely by both Amy Smart and Elden Henson – in multiple-yet-similar roles (SEE: Groundhog Day.) Great cinematography and complex storytelling round out the film.I would highly recommend this feature. Though it's a bit on the long side, it's a real thinker, albeit a Hollywoodized film. And despite its dark subject, it's fun and really gets going about half-way through when our 'hero' Evan realizes his power of time-manipulation.",8,0,1,12 February 2011
Alien vs. Predator," The Things
","(Special Note: This is a delayed review from a movie I recently saw, albeit many months ago. Without notes, these are my recollections to the best of my ability. If you were to speak to me about this particular movie, I bet I could elaborate even more. Mercifully, for most of my review's general lengths, this is going to be short, sweet & to the pointCheers.)I've seen this a few times, so this one will should be easy enough. I'm on the fence on really liking AvP or Alien Vs. Predator. For one, I always loved Bishop and Lance Henriksen, so it was nice to see him back after his absence in Alien: Resurrection. I'll stop therethere is really no comparing this to the origin series of either Alien or Predator. They sincerely made their own movie, even when using all mythos from the original franchises. That said, they really made a clichéd-filled and predictable movie that REALLY dropped the ball because they had the opportunity to put the character Alien into our time, the present and on EARTH finally and they chose to set this in the distant regions of Antarctica? But, still, it's a fun little movie with great special effects and like (the superior cross-over) Freddy Vs. Jason, you really do get the best of both worlds in a leave-your-brain-at-the-door sci-fi adventure. Recommended.",5,0,0,26 February 2013
No Country for Old Men," Old Man, That Is
","Fargo II: The Country of Old Man could've been the title and that would be cool since it had no continuity with the Cohen's other film.I loved, LOVED, No Country for Old Men. And I'm not even a western kind of guy. Before you squint, this is truly a western.The movie is not modern day. The film deals with multiples of outlaws and firearms. And it's even set in Texas. It contains all an old-west feel with twists of many story lines.This Best Picture winner has so many story lines, in fact, that it's hard to nail a synopsis on it. Suffice to say, it's about a drug deal that went wrong, a man who takes advantage of it, a psycho who's smarter than the average robber, a cop on the way out and so much more. I've already given too much away. But, I will say, this is a gem that appreciates in value and cinematography.Some might have a problem with the finale. Or even all the events leading up to the closing. I am not one of those people. And I will not ruin the 'big surprise' of someone leaving the movie abruptly, but I actually loved that making this movie all the more original and fun.Highly recommended. Just know, beforehand, you're headed into old country. When real stories were real.",10,3,4,23 December 2012
The Love Guru," Loveless
","I would call The Love Guru the worst comedy on record if there weren't so many Adam Sandler films competing for that same recognition.Mike Myers should've seen this coming. He made the glorious Austin Powers. He voiced the everlasting Shrek. He made me laugh for decades with Wayne's World. I know he was trying something new here, but he should've put a stop to it before it started rolling.I'm not even going to get into the 'offensive' category he set up. If anything, I'm offended that he thought ANY of this was humorous.Admittedly, and I will not lie, I did laugh when the title character fights a chicken – sorry, I mean COCK. That was funny, believe it or not. Wait, that and the 'Gamblers Anonymous Casino Night' line. Okay, those two scenes that took up 15 second of the 87 minutes were hilarious.The rest should be avoided at all costs. I watched this ONLY because it was featured in the How Did This Get Made podcast lineup. IF you must, watch this first, then listen to their hilarious take on it.Otherwise, ONE HUNDRED PERCENTstay away. This is an awful movie with so many things wrong with it that I don't want to spend another second on* * *Final thoughts: A coworker continuously states: What CAN'T Justin (Timberlake) do?

District 9," Forget Phoning Home
","Honestly, when I first saw the trailer for 'District 9' in the theatre I thought it was either one of those commercials for people to cease calling/texting during the theatre (I half expected the somewhat fake looking alien to pull out a cell or bash someone making a call) or an advertisement for the upcoming 'V' reboot. I was surprised that it was an actual movie, and since it looked fake and definitively unoriginal, I was going to skip it. I decided to give it a chance due to the very high ratings. Boy, I couldn't have been anymore wrong on all points. Fake looking? Not when you watch the movie and learn to see them as living beings. Unoriginal? Sure, it was part 'Cloverfield,' 'The Fly' (1986), 'Diary of the Dead,' and, not surprisingly, a lot of Jackson's previous involvements, such as 'Dead Alive.' But it took all the right ingredients and wonderfully spliced them together. Overall, it's an extreme human story, albeit the negative side, from either the aliens (or prawns) or human's POV. So negative, in fact, you honestly yearn to hope for something good to happen, but alas, it's based solely on human's dark side and history. If anyone leaves this and thinks this would never happen, good luck. Prejudices and hate are part of our nature, unfortunately, and unlike fictional tales such as 'Star Trek,' though entertaining and positive, 'District 9' truly showed honesty in how selfish and small we are. Despite some flaws (such as why a wanted man's security codes weren't revoked) it was truly a great movie: action, suspense, creativity – it never felt small budgeted; in fact, it was enormously realistic and horror/gore (it certainly earned its 'R' rating.) Certainly one of the best I've seen in 2009.",9,7,13,15 August 2009
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Too Long of a Title, Suffice to say: He Died
","Wow, what a spoiler the title of The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford was. I'm not into westerns, but strangely, when I do watch one, I generally like them. This one I didalbeit it was rather slow, VERY long and already gave away the ending in the title. Yeah, I'm assuming they assumed everyone and their great-great-great-grandparents knew the story, but it's untrue – the fact we all knew what happened. I didn't. In either case, it was entertaining, but not something I ever want to sit through again. Most notable was the performance of Casey Affleck even though Brad was still good, and the score and cinematography. Not my favorite western, not even in the top 5this, coming from someone who's seen maybe a dozen westerns in my life, so it's somewhere in the bottom 10 (of 12)but it's still worth a (as in one) viewing.",5,0,2,26 February 2013
Toy Story 4," Four Times a Charm
","When the inevitable Part 5 comes out, I NEED to see it in theatres. If there ARE theatres in 2035.I curse this movie I granted 9 stars out of 10 and barely fell behind #2 as my 3rd favorite of the series. (Seriously, it was so close to a tie with #2, more later.) I know, I shouldn't be mad with a movie I rated so highly and it's not the movie's fault. I just happen to pass out THREE times while trying to watch it. And I even nodded off this 4th time...Either it's the movie's fault or I'm not getting enough sleep...I DIGRESS! This movie is amazing. But, just like Part 3, it doesn't become amazing until the 2nd half. For both Parts 3 and 4, I liked the movie just fine with some smirks, laughs and 'AWWW!''s from me in the first half, but then the movies kick into high gear to finish off the adventures. Only, this time, in a sequel frankly NO ONE ASKED FOR (including myself,) the last 50 minutes topped all of part 3 by a landslide.Toy Story 4 reminds us, once again, of the other 3 chapters and then brings us up to speed. Only, now, there's a trashy new plaything and Woody has to spend a large chunk of the time convincing it (Forky) to be the toy 'new' kid Bonnie loves. Meanwhile, Woody has to find HIS new place with some old and new friends/enemies. Actually, explaining the plot for this kid's movie is just as complicated as the movie, itself. In fact, I'm shocked in how many characters, plot twists, stories, messages and details are in here for a KID'S movie.Nevertheless, everything worked. Everyone fit nicely together and the messages were easy to follow and I loved how the arch of Woody's story - it's really his story, after all - plays out. While most moviegoer fans felt enormous nostalgic at the end of Part 3...I felt this was the true story of Woody's belonging. (Part 3's, in fairness, was the end of Andy's story, this: Woody's.)I wasn't on board when this was announced and then almost immediately released following. It was a great trilogy that ended perfectly. But, I did love how they went one step further to complete Woody's story. Now, I'm NOT onboard for another chapter, but as long as they include Woody and Buzz again, I will watch it.Just that time, in the theatre. And with plenty of sleep. And sober.***Final thoughts: Here are the movies ranked. Keep in mind, for the first time in my ranking, there was ALMOST a tie (#s 2 and 4. They were SOOOO close!!)1 Toy Story
2 Toy Story 2
3 Toy Story 4
4 Toy Story 3Quick Recap. When #4, one I DID want to eventually see, but missed in theatres, FINALLY come available on Disney+, I decided on a marathon that opening weekend's Saturday. I did manage to get through Parts 1-3 and part of #4 before, again, passing out. My thoughts:Toy Story 1 (9/10 Stars,) which has always been my favorite, made me cringe this time with the graphics. I forgot how far we've come from the first Pixar feature length. Now, that said, it still remains as my favorite for my own nostalgia and it did make me laugh, smile and wonder the most of the four movies. In my opinion, it's the most creative, despite its limitations with graphics and BARELY falls behind...Toy Story 2 (9/10 Stars) is absolutely amazing in the LEAPS and BOUNDS of growth in computer animation. I've heard the stories about them losing most of the footage and scrambling to complete the movie on time and that it was supposed to be direct-to-video at first. It's incredible that they finished this on time, showed how beautiful Pixar could be and that the story, laughs and ingenious ideas could increase. PLUS, it featured my favorite Pixar song (and one of my all-time favorite movie songs): 'When She Loved Me.' (Makes me cry every time!) This movie is near perfect and if not for a just slightly more creative and fresh original film, it barely makes it my 2nd favorite. Side note: I've hated Jessie for decades now. This viewing marks the first time I not only accepted her, but liked and understood her. Thank goodness, there's no room for hate in our hearts!Toy Story 4 (9/5 Stars.) See Above.And finally, but not least: Toy Story 3 (8/10 Stars.) Don't get me wrong with the one entry with a half-star less review than the others. This franchise still remains as one of the best ever with creativity, heart, depth, animation and characters. But, this one didn't do it for me this time. It felt too long with too many endings - a pet peeve of mine. I understand they thought it would be the last so they tried to wrap everything up, but at times, this movie felt like it wouldn't end and while everyone OHHH'd and AWWW'd at the tug-hearted ending, I was like, END ALREADY! That all said, the 8/10 star rating should speak for itself. I really did like this movie, including the heart, comedy, Spanish Buzz and 'You Almost Went There!' fiery finale. No discount at all and this series is not complete without watching this with the rest.",9,0,1,22 February 2020
Batman Begins," How the Legend Truly Began
","I'm guessing they had two movies planned and decided to cram them both in Batman Begins.Granted, there's a lot of back-story written about the infamous Dark Knight so they made two separate movies in this reboot. No complaints here; both stories, I'll name 'Bruce Begins' and 'Error and Trial,' were great.'Bruce Begins,' or the first half, was NOT the movie I was looking forward to, back in 2005 when I was waiting for this to come out. When I watch a superhero movie, I want just that: to see a superhero immediately and throughout to the end, much like what Burton did for the original Batman waaay back in 1989. Well, far be it from me to be proved wrong. Dead wrong.'Bruce Begins' was exciting, insightful, thoroughly crafted, beautifully shot and gave a lot of the background that I was unaware of in regards to the fall and rise of Billionaire Bruce Wayne (played wonderfully by Bale.) And no, I'm not referring to the background of his parents dying in the alley – DUDE! That's been overplayed so many times, it'll never reach an emotional peak, though that's the motivation within Batman. Nevertheless, the always wonderful Neeson (who played, well, not to spoil it, the 'Mentor') gave an excellent performance. But, unfortunately, he also leads us to problem #1 in the film.I'm aware the plot all ties in towards the finale, so there really aren't any coincidences, but when the 'secret plan' is revealed by the mentor, it went from a realistic (as much as any comic book adaptation can be) movie to the level most superhero films fall to. However, it's easy to get past as good as the film is so far.Basically, 'Bruce Begins' shows the journey of the lost-soul heir who never quite got his fill of justice when his parent's killer was also killed by someone else. He still wants to avenge their untimely and meaningless demise by cleaning up the scum of Gotham City, so he leaves his hometown and scours the Earth to learn both how to fight and what makes the criminal tick, first hand. He's 'rescued' by his mentor and trained in multiple arts. Unfortunately, for the trainer, the student, Bruce, favors justice over murder.Bruce escapes, while saving his mentor from a fire Bruce helped start, destroying the home base of the mentor, his minions and the evil plans to destroyGotham. There I said it – the silly part. But, not only is that not really a spoiler, but where else would evil-doers travel to? Metropolis? No, this is a Batman movie.Slowly, 'Bruce Begins' transcends into what I think is the weaker of the two stories: 'Error and Trial.' Weaker is such a negative word here, as the story's second half was nearly excellent, but just not as good as the movie's beginning.Here, we will see Bruce return home, reunite with loved one(s) and don the famous black suit. You'll get it all: the reasons behind each toy, weapon, cape and vehicle you've grown up with in regards to Batman. Of course, there's more: not one but two (or three, or four? It's hard to keep up) villains, but that's just the Batman movie's motto: more opponents arewell, expected.Nicely, though it's a trend in the (then) 5 Batman films, they introduce new (to audiences) baddies: Scarecrow (Murphy) and Ra's Al Ghul. Unfortunately, however, they're not only the weakest of all the movies to date, but the most uninteresting. Still, they're played brilliantly by the actors involved.Each bad man is complimenting the next one in one large scheme in order towell, I don't want to ruin it, but (way unfortunately) along the way there seems to be an extreme lack of Batman's detective skills – wasn't he part of Detective Comics? For the most part, he relied on both his trusty, life-long friend and servant, Alfred (excellently played by Caine) and Fox (also wonderfully acted by Freeman.) This Batman was more brawn and vengeful than the last 4 actors to portray him. Yep, I'm including Quahog Mayor: Adam West.To be honest, this review seemed kind of down. Let me shine a light on this dark knight. This movie was thrilling, had a excellent score – one of my personal all time favorites and matches Elfman's awesome introduction to the caped crusader, brilliantly shot – the cinematography was gorgeous, the plot was intense, the acting phenomenal, contained original action sequences and it certainly set the bar extremely high, literally begging any superhero/comic book movie to challenge the depths of its creativity. And since 2005, though some have been good, only The Dark Knight – this movie's own sequel – topped it.I guess, according to my review of the original Batman, I liked this one less, though that's an apples/oranges comparison. While the original 1989 classic is perfect for what it was – a true comic-book fairy tale, this one's a more grown-up, realistic – for the most part and thoughtful adaptation of a hero that's been around for literally generations. Bypass some dialogue that simply doesn't fit, evil-plots that are borderline silly, the bumps, bruises and blunders of Batman's first outings that are a tad-bit hard to watch and one of my biggest pet peeves – the absolute and thoughtless destruction Batman leaves behind in his GTA road chase, and I will still highly recommend this adventure due to all the greatness that overshadowed its weaknesses. And this is coming from a die-hard Superman fan, so you know I mean it when I say: SEE IT!",Null,0,0,22 July 2010
Twilight," No fangs? Sunlight doesn't hurt? Oh, this MUST be a vampire film!
","'Twilight' was one of the most hilarious movies I've seen in awhile; at least that's how it started. Reminding me a lot of 'The Happening,' I found myself laughing out loud during the first half and then simply hating life during the last half. I have heard this was meant for teenage girls. Fine, I get it and I'm not one. However, how I wish more for them. They deserve so much more. It's absolutely no wonder why this movie dropped its audience 62% on weekend 2. There are so many points to cover for this two-hour tragedy, I'll at least attempt to cover the incredibly bad aspects: awful, laugh-out-loud acting and dialogue/narration, horrible soundtrack, special effects were downright amusing, the bad ('Johnny Suede') hairdos and the desperate attempts at a franchise  let's just set up every scene to set the stage for the inevitable part II, III, etc. I'm just going to assume the people playing the parts (it's too nice to call them actors) read the original material. Well, the 'I can't live without you' wooden dialogue seems like they are seriously reading from the book rather than playing the parts. And one of the worst aspects of this film was the fact that after all the lovey-dovey stares, (oh, God, the constant stares Bella and Edward give each other. STOP, please, God, STOP!) they seemed to forget one of the most basic elements in any plot  the adversary. OK. Well, let's introduce one 3/4s into the film in the shape of Brad Pitt. Why does he want Bella? To get back to the family? Why? Oh, I guess I'll have to wait for Part II. And yes, I plan on waiting in line for that film. I'm always in the mood for a good laugh or dozen.",1,16,23,23 March 2009
Liar Liar," The sequel should involve a Politician Pappy...
","I could fill two pages of quotes from Liar, Liar and only skim the surface on how incredibly funny it was. Yet, I wouldn't be doing the movie justice because it's not all about comedy, but heart, drama and growing.A lot of movies try hard, they really do try their best to blend comedy and human drama and come up with the same conclusion when water meets oil. Director Shadyac picked the perfect crew, writer and actors to make us truly believe the heartbreak these characters go through.Immediately labeled as a 'liar' or lawyer, as teacher corrects student Max Reede (Cooper,) attorney (and Max's father) Fletcher Reede (Carrey) is close to the top of his firm and inching closer. Unfortunately for him, he's sacrificing the love he truly has for his son, whom he shares joint custody with his ex, Audrey (Tierney.) He doesn't just sacrifice, he's abolishing all hopes and dreams of the little one, even when Max, nor, oddly his mother, give up on him. In the main premise scene of the movie, Max make a birthday wish that for one day, Fletcher cannot tell a lie, strangely enough, the day starts at 8:15 PM.Unfortunately, Fletcher has the biggest and Make-Partner case of his life defending Samantha Cole (Poker Goddess Jennifer Tilly with unusually short and blonde hair) when everyone knows she's slimy/guilty/slutty and the only way to get her 'just rewards' in her own divorce case is for Fletcher to lie.He needs a work around, when it's finally clear to him (THE PEN IS BLUE!) he cannot even fib. Serious comedy ensues when he juggles his anti-deception (apparently in any form), his son who might be leaving 3,000 miles with mom and new fiancé, the case, his boss & boss's boss and actually taking to heart what this really means.A la Groundhog Day. Which, by the way, ranks slightly over this movie, but both are under the same fantasy realm in which a character must embark on unusual circumstances to, well, learn a lesson.I hate to downgrade the movie to 'Okay, fine, you have to like Jim Carrey to like this.' I understand the world's divided with Carrey lovers/haters, Adam Sandler haters/lovers, etc, but I have spoken to multiple people that don't care for Carrey and still love this movie.I'm thinking it has to do with the excellent acting all around, the deep humor and characters and also the heart that went into the story.If you've seen the recent Toy Story 3, and you see that little girl in the finale sad she couldn't get the toywell, that's a cartoon (and well done, I might add.) I truly felt Max's heart shatter when his father lies to him or lets him down. At the same time, I honestly felt he never gave up, even though it was absolutely knocking him down. Simultaneously, I felt Fletcher grow and show true love for his son. You don't get these two characters in half the Dramas that come out.And this is labeled as a comedy. It's freaking hilarious from moment one to Carrey actually making fun of his own career, concerning funny faces, to the outrageous finale that if you feel like you don't believe that could happen – remind yourself: the movie's based on a birthday wish that actually comes true.Make sure you watch the deleted scenes, including the outtakes in the closing credits. Too bad this received a PG-13aside from a few minor words and sexual situations, this really is good for the whole family. SEE IT!",9,1,1,8 August 2010
Climax," Dance, Drugs and Dialogue
","(Quickie Review.) This very indie arthouse film reminds me a lot of Nicolas Cage's Mandy, in which, it's wacko, I didn't fully absorb it this first time and I absolutely need to see it again. Maybe, with a lot less alcohol.
It starts off with an extreme amount of DANCING (which, truthfully, I really enjoyed) and then follows with LONG dialogue scenes between multiple parties (the dancers) in a dance studio on day three of their training. ANNND repeat. It was Dance, Dialogue, Dance, Dialogue, over and over. But, mercifully, someone remembered there had to a plot inserted and it got interesting. I do understand this movie, as crazy as it was, but admittedly, some day I'm going to have to do a double feature between this and Mandy to fully embrace the 'art.'",4,0,2,19 October 2019
Wreck-It Ralph," Wreck-It Shrek
","I really hope the inevitable sequel to Wreck-It Ralph brings more of the my-day video games to the forefront than this one did.And thatis my only 'complaint' about this movie – and trust me: that's really not a gripe at all. I loved this movie, up and down, from beginning to end. While I would liked to have seen more of my favorites growing up, like Street Fighter II and Pac-Man (well, Mrs. to be exact) the story of Ralph, his old and new peers, were absolutely awesome on their own.I know everyone and their mother and grandchild loved the Shrek series, or at least the first two. I did like them both (and the great spin off: Puss in Boots), with Shrek 2 being better than the original. This movie, this near masterpiece in animation, was MY Shrek-like homage to my youth.Nearing his 3rd decade in the arcade, Wreck-It Ralph wants more than bad-guy status and to win an award so he may live comfortably with his pals in his video game's penthouse. So, crisscrossing different stand up games – the ones I thoroughly enjoyed at Chuck E. Cheese's growing up – he has the adventure of a computer byte. And so do we.The movie had great cinematography, songs, depth and fantastic voices. Also, many fun, funny and interesting characters appear and despite all the clichés and predictable plot lines, every one of them are fun and exciting. I found myself laughing, tearing and touched by the paths the movie took and I'm sorry I didn't see this great (and should-flat-out win the Best Animated Oscar) film sooner.

Before Sunset," Sunset with Happiness
","What an experiment. Nine literal years following the event(s) of Before Sunrise, inside and out of the fictional continuation, came the very well done follow-up, Before Sunset.I adore original sequels. Especially since there are so few of them. Now, I might lose some credibility for this one, but Before Sunset and Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 share something in common with me. Both had probably thee most original concepts for a second chapter.Now, granted, Blair Witch 2 wasn't an overall great film, and nowhere near it's predecessor, but the idea of a sequel based on the idea the first was a movie was truly original. (Sadly, it went nowhere near it could've gone with that initial premise.) Here, with Before Sunrise, we get to literally see where these characters AND actors changed in nine years.Basically, this movie does take place almost a decade after the events of the first movie explaining a ton of what happened following that fateful day for our two lovebirds: Jesse and Celine. They meet again after some time has passed and it's like no time had passed. Again, the camera follows these two soul mates through, now, Paris, and they talk and walk and learn about each other's new lives and loves.As if no time had passed (and it helps seeing these movies back to back,) these two feel just as comfortable with each other as they did when they first met. Only nowthere's tension because they did grow up, apart and with someone else.While, I liked the movie as a whole and absolutely loved the concept of the 9-year gap of both fiction and nonfiction, it wasn't as fresh after awhile as the original. That doesn't take from the fun I did have with this; it was still very nice to follow these two around and how much they understand each other.(Spoiler comingif you don't like those, just skip the next paragraph.)The absolute best part of this movie, when you get past the premise, was the 100% ambiguous finale. The first movie, did give direction where the future was headed, and, yet, you still could draw your own conclusion. This one abruptly ended, which, while I was a little puzzled at first, made me fall in love with the decision of the filmmakers.I did take a Sunday and watch the entire trilogy and I marveled on what it would've been like had I been a fan of this series and had to wait to see what happens next. I can't imagine what it was like for those who fell in love with these characters and had to wait yet another nine years to find out what the ending of this movie meant.I guess I cheated, but nonetheless, I enormously loved this climax.It's a bridge movie, but it's still definitely worth viewing.",8,0,0,2 September 2013
The Princess Bride," A Masterpiece as you would wish for.
","This is going to date me, but when I was a kid, my sister loved the soap opera 'Santa Barbara,' and because of Robin Wright, she wanted to see 'The Princess Bride.' It became one of her favorites, getting me to watch it. After watching and only being a kid, I just 'liked' it. Since then, I must have seen this 20+ times. It is truly a timeless classic, made with pure heart, adventure, comedy, excitement, romance, etc – in other words, all of the needed elements of a masterpiece. (I do use the word 'timeless' if you forgive the He-Man guys behind the all-but two-year-old Fred Savage and the high-tech 'video game' he is playing. Other than that, it can be viewed in any decade.) We have Grandfather that reads the said-title to his ill grandson and so the story unfolds, beautifully. Westley and Buttercup are the central characters in this fairy-tale land, but all of the actors/characters have such depth and realism, it's almost never-ending in excitement when one appears, leaves and/or returns. You will see hilarious comedy, exciting sword-fighting or mind-games and true love. This movie is also perfect for the whole family. You might see people die, but it's as graphic as people simply falling off screen. Little blood, no nudity, no language, no sexI love the fact when they set out to make this, they didn't need to add any of that in and now have an all-time-classic. I'd hate to ruin any of the surprises, or the people the characters meet along the way or the near-death experiences they take with strides, so I would just highly recommend this all ages, to all audiences. If you've already experienced one of the best movies of all time, enjoy it again; see how movies should be made.",10,7,12,12 November 2009
The Transporter," Transport this Beauty Home Tonight!
","Ah. The movie that introduced me to Jason Statham. Unfortunately, it took me a long time to get to this film.I was very hesitant to see The Transporter, much as I was to watch my first Jackie Chan film (Supercop.) So it was years after release, and instantly I took to Statham's charm, acting, charisma and fighting ability. By the time I watched this, part 2 was already headed to theaters (which I did see on the big screen) and part 3 was planned.But, I digress. This one involves an ex-super soldier who, well, 'transports' items/people from one locale to another using basic and fundamental rules to make a living. And he's good at it, despite a noisy French officer. The transporter, Frank (Statham) gets inadvertently caught up in a human-smuggling ring and though he likes anonymity (obviously) he regains somewhat a heart and helps a victim and tries to stop the bad guys.Really. If you cherish the Jackie Chan movies, you'll like this one. You know what I'm talking about. Barely a plot. Barely good acting. Less plot, more kick-butt. You'll then like this action vehicle.I don't really like comparing Statham to Chan, as they are 100% different, but they do produce similar movies. While Chan has a certain charm for his fan base, Statham also has his own way of producing charisma for the audience. And he got me hooked.Best scenes involve NO CGI or any special effects (something part two of this series should've taken note of but failed) and just having Statham driving or hand-to-hand combat. Just his character's depth and fighting technique is worth the time, money and effort into watching what would've actually been a run-of-the-mill average foreign action flick.

Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," That's a Haboob, Baby!
","Let's start with, I LOVED Part III a lot. So this unlikely follow-up due to the poor box office of the third one would really have to show a lot to take over as the best Mission: Impossible entry.My God, was Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol fantastic. Excellent, even. Funny, adventurous, real, exciting, thrilling and a movie I am dying to see again are just a few emotions I had when I left the theatre. Best Action of the Year doesn't quite sum it up. (Of course, we're talking the worst action-film year in history, so let's say, it's the best action movie since the last Bourne film and James Bond's Casino Royale.)If you will see this movie, your mission, choose you to accept the alternative – jail time for not seeing it, is to see it in IMAX. And no worries, mercifully, it's not in 3D. The whole movie looks brilliant on the extra-tall screen, but if just one scene will convince you, it's from the trailer: Hunt (Tom Cruise) scaling the World's Tallest Building: the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. That alone is worth the entire ticket price.Funny about that scene, during super-spy Hunt's accent and decent outside the 130th floor, they say (and show) a gigantic 'Dust Storm' is approaching. My roommate and I, who both live near Phoenix, AZ were like: 'Eh, it's just a Haboob. No biggie. Go inside, wait it out and wash your car the next day.'I usually give a synopsis with my reviews. It's just better not to. Let them surprise you. It's a fully action-packed, almost from beginning to end, spy thriller. Let them tell you the story, the twists, the suspense and allow yourself to feel what they feel. Trust me, this is a ride you'll want to take a few times. I know I'm going back to IMAX as soon as possible.Don't wait for video or Netflix. Don't see the smaller big-screen version. And don't remember your distaste of Tom Cruisewhich, by the way, I never had. See this movie ASAP in IMAX. One of the best of 2011.",9,7,12,17 December 2011
Revolutionary Road," Runaway Road
","Leo and Kate's (and don't forget the wonderful Kathy Bates as well) reunion here in 'Revolutionary Road' from 'Titanic' reminded me so much of the Richard Gere/Julia Roberts's 'Pretty Woman' follow-up/reunion 'Runaway Bride.' In both cases, the originals they starred in were incredibly better and the latter films weren't complete disappointments, just not as great. Here we have Leo acting like Leo, but much better is Kate who shows so much depth to the lost housewife of the fifties who realized what little anyone else that lived in the area/time either saw or talked about: the 'Stepford Wives' effect. Of course, I'm not talking about robots, but they might as well just be. Men: grow, find a great, but boring job, marry, have 1 kid, get promoted, have another kid, repeat. Women: just do whatever the man says. I liked Kate in this movie because I truly believed her anguish, the lost feeling she had, the 'no-escape' clause she thought there was. If anyone gets nominated, it should be her. Everyone else, including Leo, might have just walked off the 'Mad Men' extras back lot. Overall, I liked the film and the study of the two seemingly (but really not) cardboard cuts of the neighborhood (or times); however it seemed to stretch a 20-page-novelette into 2 hours of film. And boy, did it really make me want to have a cigarette, and not because of any steamy scenes.",5,6,13,29 December 2008
28 Days Later...," I've had rage, but not like this before...
","Recently, I re-watched one of my favorite 'zombie movies' ever: 2004's 'Dawn of the Dead' thinking/reviewing it as my favorite zombie movie. It may very well be, still, but '28 Days Later' was 10x better. Luckily, I can keep my statements in tack: 'Dead' was, in fact, a 'zombie' movie, whereas 'Later' was a movie about 'the infected,' making it oodles more realistic and scary. 'Later' started off with an awesome concept: ignorant 'Animal Lovers' inadvertently release the 'Rage' virus, something so brutal, it makes all other diseases (AIDS, cancer, that 'swine flu' so-called epidemic) look like child's play. Well, wouldn't you know it, but '28 days later' a man awakes in an abandoned hospital and finds a new, empty world. Quickly, he's both pursued by 'the infected' but also rescued by survivors. He must now cope with the reality that surrounds him. It's an extremely unique and original concept, even by today's standards and the acting, dialogue, grimness were all above average. I loved this movie. It's not for everyone, as it is both incredibly depressing and graphic/gory, but it's a real eye-opener on how humans really behave. With or without flesh-eating 'infected' ruling the world. Now, the movie's not 100% perfect: there's the usual 'slow-down and have fun' scene practically every zombie, er, sorry, 'infectious disease' movie has, it's slow in spots and it does contain its plot holes, such as this is an extremely fast moving virus – one drop of blood/saliva will transform you into a monster in 2 seconds, yet, it seems to make it from London to NYC. After watching these infected people run and cause chaos, it's hard to imagine one sitting still on a boat or plane trip overseas. Regardless, it's 100% recommended for fans of the genre.",Null,2,3,2 November 2009
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Lost in the Park(ing lot)
","Originally, when I watched Jurassic Park upon opening weekend, I wasn't too fond of it. Despite its shortcomings: an unoriginal script that relied heavy on what they could do with special effects – damn, those dinos still look real! – it has grown on me over the years, especially due to those realistic dinos and the excellent character of Ian Malcolm (Goldblum.)Unfortunately, as the tagline goes, something has survived, but it wasn't Ian who's been reduced to 'Action Figure' in the follow-up: The Lost World: Jurassic Park.And as uneven as the movie is, boy it wants to be several different flicks, the movie is a very nice, updated and darker tale than the original. That's not saying it's better, but it's a good sequel, nonetheless.One of the flicks it wanted to be, and heavily advertised, was a truer version of the 60-year-old Godzilla tale of a dinosaur running amok in the city. This: I could not wait to see and alas, was thoroughly disappointed that it was only the final act with roughly 15 minutes (of 129) of city terror. Too bad. In addition, one of my complaints of the first, were the wooden and boring children Spielberg so loves to shine on (E.T.) Here, I'm only guessing he was trying to make a statement of acceptance with the new 'kid star' of the feature: Vanessa Lee Chester, who plays Ian's daughter, Kelly. She's black, he's white, I get it – this is more of a shove-down-the-throat statement more relevant in the Lethal Weapon franchise – but I could care less about that. What I cared most about, was not only how dull she was, but she actually made the kids in the first one more lovable. I really need to tone down my criticisms as it could always be worse (SEE: Jurassic Park III.)The series did take a good turn with the direction the series took with an 'Aliens' approach and a great new character of the hunter, Roland Tembo (Postlethwaite.) Yeah, I know, it's again (mostly) on the island, and yeah, I know, it's another rescue mission, but it's fun to watch. Even with the other (again, Lethal Weapon) subliminal message of animal cruelty – thanks mostly to Vince Vaughn in his break-through role of PETA-type photographer, Nick.I'm not an activist, but I definitely don't condone the cruelty to animals. That said, whenever a movie 'sides' with the PETA soldiers, I laugh my ass off when they get bit, themselves, from the very beings they're trying to save. SEE: 28 Days Later.What we have here isThe return of John Hammond (Attenborough) who, by the way died at the end of Jurassic Park (the book) soI guess somethings have survived, indeed. Anyways, in a flimsy way of getting Dr. Ian Malcolm back onto an island full of giant (and small) monsters, Hammond uses Ian's girlfriend, Dr. Sarah Harding (Moore) as bait. She's been on the island for some time, studying the animals. Ian accepts, making this more of a rescue mission (hence, the action star who checks his chaos at the door.)Undeniably, it quickly turns into 'how do we get off the island in one piece' again, when daughter Kelly stows away and Nick's constantly trying to sabotage the other human inhabitants of the island from bringing the dinos to the mainland – San Diego. Nick's feisty efforts of saving the genetically, shouldn't-be-here-anyways, engineered dinosaurs does lead to chaos (full circle) and to people's deaths. Oh, well, at least he saved a few animal lives.The two groups merge with the common goal of escape since Nick's animal-lovin' ways caused enough disturbance, they're all vulnerable and at the same time, lunch for the dinos.Obviously, they're gonna get off the island, just so they can get to what the advertisements promised: a T-Rex in San Diego.It's a satisfying conclusion to part one and contains a lot of action and great cinematography. Also, they step up what they've already accomplished in part one: two T-rexes fighting for their young, this time in my favorite scene in the movie – when the trailer goes over the edge.It's worth a watch and like I said, it's a good conclusion: stop watching the Jurassic Park series here. Trust meyou don't want to waste your precious life on the irrelevant, franchise-killer: Jurassic Park III.",5,1,5,23 January 2011
It Follows," Sex Kills
","While I'm not into supernatural films, I did grow up on A Nightmare on Elm Street which this film totally represented. Speaking of which, it was thoroughly refreshing for these filmmakers to go back to the absolute basics vs. the oh-so-boring and over-used haunted house tale of the past decade or so. That said, they worked on many themes of the past and made it a little more modern and realistic, so I completely appreciated that. Well done and recommended for anyone who wants to go back to what makes horror work vs. found footage or the bland haunted house they can't sell.",6,3,14,1 June 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Rise and Repeat
","Granted, my only exposure to The Planet of the Apes mythology was the 2001 remake, Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes, though I might have seen the original only, but I don't remember. That said, I already had the story down, the 'secret' the 1968 origin held in the final seconds and the characters.So, what does Rise of the Planet of the Apes (RPA) bring to light? Oh, the how and why. The similarly titled, 2007's Hannibal Rising, also answered some predated Lecter questions. Come to think of it, there's also The Dark Knight Rises coming soon, but that's neither here nor there nor a prequel.I digress, RPA was oodles better than the Hannibal Jr. show and quite entertaining on its own, even if you've never seen the originals. They did a fantastic job of making a prequel its own. Sure, there were the inevitable homage to the Charlton Heston 'classic' – one that made me smile (LOOK UP) – but RPA definitely stood on its own. So much so, if they continue this 'new' series, it would surely welcomed by me.RPA tells the classic tale of Apes vs. Alzheimer's, whereas apes are being experimented on to cure the disease. James Franco's Will is the idea man and one of the movie's major flaws is the obvious reason why he wants to cure the incurable old-age ailment.Get past that! (Yeah, including myself, Mr. Criticpants) RPA is the main definition of popcorn-fare. The movie's A-B-C with evident conclusions. Granted, it's better than most popcorn movies, such as ANY Transformers disaster, but it's still not to be taken too seriously.At any rate, the target chimp of this movie is Caesar who begins his 'learning' on day two and only gets smarter from there on. The movie jumps years like they were Tom Hanks' time spend on the Wilson Island and when Caesar's grown, he's imprisoned when he defends his 'grandfather' Charles (John Lithgow) and guess how happy half-human Caesar is about that.Enough examples are shown on why Apes are more human than, well, humans and we get to the foreseen finale.I'm not dogging the movie – on the contrary, again, it was entertaining even when it slowed to a halt in the mid-section or when it was predictable. It has incredible special effects – tell me once when the Apes looked, acted or blended (with live action) unconvincingly and I will defend the movie.It's worth a shot. Heck, they didn't jump on the 3-D bandwagon – KUDOS to the movie for that bold move. SEE IT.Side Note: I will need to see it again soon. Laughably and sadly, we had this imbecile sitting to my left that snorted, laughed at the wrong times, talked and read out every word on the screen. EVEN when it was just a police car driving by on the screen 'HEH! Police. Hee hee.' Sure, I made fun of him; I turned to him and said 'First movie?' and later, I laughed myself, saying: 'I can't decide who's the bigger primate: the one on the screen or to my left.' Alas, it didn't shut up the ass. Eh, similar to the movie's 'motto,' some people have to believe in evolution. Here was proof.",6,0,7,6 August 2011
The Little Mermaid," A Cut Above
","(I present to you: My 1,500th review. And I just *had* to pick a movie that has been Part of my World for almost 30 yearsCheers!)It won't cost muchJust my blood.Starting with 1988 and deep into 1989 I began my love affair with cinema. To date, that last year of the 80s is my favorite twelve months of movies of any year. I saw everything, anything I could use my little cash on. Some repeatedly and some I would cherish for life. Of all the ones I loved so much: Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Batman, Lethal Weapon 2 and (my first ever James Bond feature) Licence to Kill, late in the year would come a movie that would mold me, bring me joy, heart and love: The Little Mermaid.It would do so much to my life, but for starters, it would get me hooked on Disney. I never really grew up on Disney and at 15, in 1989, I had seen some Disney 'cartoons,' but never was the biggest fan. Until November 1989. I loved this movie. Everysinglesecond of it. For the time, it was inventive, explosive and offered both a fantastic script and daring visuals. I was captivated and sang along to the words of the songs that would stay with me for nearly 30 years.To date, today, on January 20, 2016, watching this movie for the first time in a decade or more and probably the 100th time, all the same feelings, joy, tears, smiles and laughter were all the same. As if I was watching this masterpiece for the first time.Yes, I sang right along with each musical segment. But, I also laughed out loud, even as an adult at the classic and harmless humor. (They didn't need to make this PG-13 for adults to partake like they do nowadays.) I still loved every bit of it, even after almost three decades had passed since my first viewing.Teen Mermaid Ariel dreams of something more, a grass-is-greener scenario, and with her father inadvertently pushing her into the magic of the witch, she gets her wish. Butwith a price. It's easy now to see how this inspired many more Disney animated features and attractions. And it's almost forgotten with great efforts since, including the follow-ups like Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King and pretty much all of Pixar's films. Too bad. Ariel started it all and will always hold the biggest portion of my heart from anything Disney can throw at me.FunnyI have barely mentioned the music above. The music. The MAGNIFICENT MUSIC. The incredible songs that I cannot help but sing out- loud and even dance with as if I were a child even younger than when I first saw this. It's hard to pick a favorite, but the top two are definitely 'Part of Your World' and 'Poor Unfortunate Souls.' That's not to diminish the excellent other tracks that I still sing with the top of my lungs, but those mean the most to me for both heart and cleverness. So, the music's great. So is the score, the dialogue, screenplay, cinematography and heart. In fact, there isn't a flaw here and no child or adultshould be denieddown where it's wettertake it from me.***Final thoughts: Hilarious, but not really at the time, but the viewing in theatres I remember the most was 10 years after the film's initial run. In classic Disney fashion, they re-released The Little Mermaid back in the theatres for its 10th Anniversary and I just had to go back to seait again on the big screen. That day, sometime in 1999, I was working on my homemade computer and cut my right, middle finger. Pretty bad – tons of blood lost, more than I'd ever see leave my body before or since. Though a pretty deep cut in my fingerprint, I chose just to let it bleed, bandage it – multiple times – and go see The Little Mermaid again with hopes it would stop bleeding before the feature began that Sunday. Rarely will I recall that experience, nor look directly at my middle, right finger, but when I do see that scar left, 17½ years ago, I will always be reminded of The Little Mermaid. She might not have actually cut me, but Ariel became a part of me for life.",10,1,1,20 January 2016
Avengers: Infinity War," To Infinity and Wait
","As long as the stone is not a kidney stone, Purple Homer Simpson's Gotta Catch 'Em All!I had a couple of concerns before going into this feature and thankfully: I was wrong on both of them. Number one: I was dreading an hour plus long battle like at the end of Lord of the Rings 2-3, Matrix 3 and any Transformers movie. Personally, anything longer than 20 minutes of on-screen battles bore me. If I'm at home watching them, I will literally pull out my phone and play games while the battle rages on. This did not happen here. Thank you so much. I really didn't want to take a break and leave the theatre during a far-too-long battle scene. And number two: I was concerned about the aforementioned Purple Homer Simpson. In the brief moments we've seen him before, he looked incredibly corny and fake and I never once believed he would be as all-powerful as they built him up to be. BUT, he ended up being the best character of the entire 16,090 characters they chose for this Part 3a. He was deep, interesting and the CGI wasn't that bad. Now, the rest of the characters...were spot on from the same characters we grew with and loved for the past decade. Not a single actor stepped out of bounds and they owned their scenes.So, yeah, you simply cannot go into Avengers 3a without seeing, well, all of the previous 18 films. Most specifically, Thor: Ragnarok, the Guardians of the Galaxy films and Captain America: Civil War. But to sum up this mercifully simple plot, a big baddie is attempting to collect all the stones that originated the universe so he can play God with his warped sense of mercy. Our heroes, or 'Avengers,' are spread out and thin across the universe, but do have a common goal of preventing Purple Homer Simpson from achieving his collection.I already knew this before going in, but if you didn't, you should prepare yourself for a Lord of the Rings 1-2 conclusion and an Empire Strikes Back storm before the calm. And also, for only 2nd or 3rd time in the ENTIRE MCU library, the post-credit scene is absolutely necessary to see. The other 15 or so times, I say just skip the post-credit scenes and wait to see them on the net. This one, yes, you really should see. The movie got some many things right and a few minor errors. What went right: they chopped down the humor. In most Marvel movies, the humor seems to be 80% of the script leaving a small percentage for Superhero'ing action. I did find myself laughing out loud here a few times, but thankfully, it was just a few sprinkled jokes. I was there to see a Superhero movie and not another comedy.Also, as stated, the characters were spot on and the action scenes were intense, fresh and wholeheartedly used every bit of the Avenger in those scenes to their absolute potential. Further, aside from some major pacing and editing choices (MAN, some scenes seemed to end and the camera just kept on rolling for upwards of 5 seconds on more than a dozen scenes,) the movie never felt too long and certainly not 2½ hours. I can't give away my other huge gripe with this movie (other than the pacing/editing) without spoilers, but suffice to say, the third act, specifically the final moments really irked me. And no, not the abrupt ending - again, this was basically the ending to the first two Lord of the Rings movies. I hope, like I stated above, I am wrong on how I see the ending to this when I observe how Part 3b is handled. If I am wrong, then the stars I gave this movie will suddenly rise.Avengers Part 3a doesn't hold a candle to Avengers 1, but it does blow Part 2 out of the water. Still, you definitely need Part 2 to have any of Part 3a. Infinity War is definitely recommended, but I'd probably wait until the day Part 3b comes out and make sure you see, um, all of the previous 18 films prior, as well.***Final thoughts: Since this movie is really just a first half of an overall chapter, I'd probably have to wait until Part 3b comes out before completely forming an opinion on where this ranks. That said, right now, I know it absolutely ranks high in the (so-far) 19 MCU films.",7,4,15,29 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Kill Time Vol. 9
","The great Elvira once rhetorically asked and politely answered herself out loud: 'Hey, does anyone know what that movie was about? Uh, I'll tell you what it was about. It was about an hour and a half too long.'Coincidentally, about one and a half hours into this almost three hour film I asked myself what this movie was about and thought: this is gonna be a tough synopsis in my review. But, I had faith in Quentin Tarantino and knew, somehow, he was gonna link the sixty subplots together and/or circle around and make this all make sense.At about 2 hours, 20 minutes - I couldn't take it anymore. I sat in silence this whole movie up to that point and finally asked my friend: WHAT IS THIS MOVIE ABOUT? (He laughed; he didn't know.) Fast forward to the end credits and I said more out-loud to the screen: 'I'd really like to know what that movie was about?!'The guy next to me, who seemed to enjoy it way more than myself said: 'Well, it's a story.' I politely agreed with him and asked what story was it. Him: 'Oh, it was a fantasy.' Yeah, thanks, I got *that.*Don't get me wrong. This movie was extremely well shot and the acting between Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt was AMAZING. In fact, if both got nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, I'd be totally on board. And, I did really like the music and a ton of the scenes made me laugh or excited - namely with tough guy Pitt's character.But, the story, or lack thereof, was so incredibly frustrating for me. I got it. I don't need to see it again - as a matter of fact, I never want to see this again. I can follow the movie just fine. Without spoiling specifics, there were a good dozen or more actions suggested and then concluded. Over and over, someone suggested something to another and they completed said task and the characters moved on. Repeatedly.And the main twist? Well, as people love to do - I won't here, you're welcome - someone spoiled the climax for me. They didn't come right out and tell me the ending, but basically winked that I would enjoy this 'take.' Even without that person spoiling the movie, it's not hard to see where this was going, especially if you've seen other Tarantino movies.So, if that's the case, if the movie's based on the twist, it makes for a very weak third act that was supposed to make up for all the mundane scenes we sat through for nearly two and a half hours.Fine, there is a 'plot.' Basically, a soon-to-be out TV/Movie actor in 1969 is trying to reinvent himself and his insecurities with his best bud/stunt double in tow. He goes up and down and sideways to stay above water. And then real life comes a-knocking.It's sad I'm so frustrated with all this because I absolutely loved both the chemistry between the two leads and their individual characters. And I wanted them to live and succeed. But, when all is said and done, it's just a string of causes and effects with absolute conclusions for each, so basically, you're just watching people live out their everyday lives.I certainly did NOT hate this movie, but as you'll see below, this is absolutely my least favorite Tarantino film and hope to never take this trip down Hollywood Blvd. again.***Final thoughts:
All Nine Ranked Quentin Tarantino Directed films, if the Kill Bill Volumes are counted separately:
1. Kill Bill Vol. 2
2. The Hateful Eight
3. Jackie Brown
4. Kill Bill Vol. 1
5. Pulp Fiction

Gone Girl," beGone Oscars
","BeginRantNow.I understand most people are beyond the SNUBBED-GAME by now as I'm usually late to any game, but DAMN. How in HELL did Gone Girl miss a Best Picture nomination? Or Best Screenplay? This movie wasn't just amazingly written, but one of the most original movies I've seen in 2014 and one of the best of the year overall.It helps that I absolutely loved the character of 'Amazing Amy' (Rosamund Pike.) I will not spoil the reason why I loved her as much as I did for I discovered it myself while watching this movie pretty cold. Mercifully, they did nominate Pike for a Best Acting Oscar, though I am uncertain at this point (February 4, 2015) if she'll win, especially since I haven't seen all the Best Acting films nominated. But, I would certainly love to see her accept the award.Now, she wasn't the best this movie has to offer. In fact, I might consider a Best Director nod and definitely – as mentioned – a Best Screenplay nominee. Heck, I even liked Tyler Perry, and I usually cannot stand him or his movies.That all said, yeah, Ben Affleck is still a terrible actor and might have turned off some of the voters. Granted, this wasn't his worst performance, but it was definitely right on par with most of his career.This movie completely surpassed more than half of the Best Pictures nominated for 2014. In fact, only this, Birdman, The Imitation Game and The Theory of Everything were granted the same 4/5 star rating from me with this and Birdman an imaginary tie for first place had this been nominated. EndRantNow, and begin my remaining review.I don't want to give away too much about the plot or what I favored the most, only because the experience of barely knowing the synopsis of husband Affleck being accused/investigated for murdering his vanished wife, Amy, was a good place to start with and then proceed with watching the complex and deep plot unravel. It's long, and yeah, some could be cut out, but it kept me going. Especially, the character of Amy.And keeping with my experience, I implore you to see this movie and let it draw you in with its many twists like a great novel you have in front of you. I love movies like this – ones that start off with a simple premise and evolve and surprise me. I even had to rewatch the finale just to understand and absorb the whole meaning.The Oscar voters are probably right with their picks and nominations 50% of the time. Like The Lego Movie being snubbed for both Best Pic and Best Animated film this year and nearly a decade back with the completely underserved shut out of Brokeback Mountain for the win, this movie deserves a helluva more attention.Sorry, I did think the rant was over. So, just see the movie and you'll begin ranting yourself.* * *Final thoughts: Though, personally, I thoroughly encourage more penis shots in movies, the Ben Affleck completely out of left-field, quick second or three, full frontal shot wasn't just unnecessary, but felt manufactured to cause buzz. It was clearly established he was without clothes due to the shower running, so, honestly, it didn't feel like it belonged in either the scene or the movie. Granted, I'm not an Affleck fan, but seeing 'it' had me scratching my head more than enjoying the view.Did it ruin the movie? No, it's still a penis shot, after all. And even though I didn't think it fit, at least it wasn't the billionth woman to disrobe for cinema.",8,2,7,4 February 2015
Django Unchained," Why No D.U. Vol. 2?
","Granted. I'm not a fan of long winded tales, and even less of the old West, but dang. Django Unchained was too damn long. It truly should've been his next Vol. 1 one year, and Vol. 2 the next; I would've loved, needed, the intermission.O.K. trying not to start off in the wrong cowboy bootI did like this movie, and especially loved Christoph Waltz and his amazing character, Dr. King (huh.) Schultz. Surprisingly, the star and title character, Django (and Jamie Fox's performance) was so incidental to Schultz, it's a wonder why he was cast.Oh, that's right; Samuel L. Jackson was too old and needed to play the 'old black man/slave role.'In normal Tarantino mode, the movie starts one way and even advertises that premise, and then switches gear even before the movie's half over. There are the typical long-winded dialogue scenes that, mercifully, don't go on as long as his Inglourious Basterds or Death Proof shots did. There is the excessive gore and (way too loud) soundtrack – which happens to be his worst one, to date. And there is the quick zoom-ins that remind people that Tarantino loves those old Grindhouse films.Get past all that, like I did, and I did enjoy the journey of the enormously smart and quick-witted bounty hunter, Schultz. Oh, I guess, and his 'the 'D' is silent' sidekick, Django.Picture it: the old West. Slaves haven't been freed and what is the deal with Lincoln-era films this year? Sorry. Where was I? Slave Django is acquired by Dr. Schultz in order to find three unwise men and after becoming fond of each other, the movie switches to the retrieval of Django's wife.Blood, tears, gore, comedy, revenge and bullets are all Tarantino Trademarks and you'll get an abundance here. Watch this for some quick wit, some slave owner's just deserts and overall, the awesome Christoph Waltz.",5,0,1,17 January 2013
Get Out," Stay In!
","I've never been a ghost kind of horror fan. In fact, my two favorite ghost films aren't even horror movies: the original Ghostbusters and Ghost. BUT, I've heard so many positive things about this horror flick, I decided to finally see it.Thank God, I was wrong. About ghosts, anyways.This is NOT a ghost story as I somehow misinterpreted it to be. That was my bad. What it is is a refreshing, original, wonderfully written and awesome throwback to real horror movies from 40 years ago.Yep. This could've easily come out in 1977 and with the exception of cell phones and the TSA, it would've fit perfectly. Talk about a reverse-timeless movieA romantic duo, Chris and Rose head to Rose's family estate to introduce her family to her new beau. BUT, things aren't pitch perfect as they appear and Chris starts to see the weirdness that's slowly engulfing him. Will hedare I?...GET OUT in time?I already liked Jordan Peele a lot from several of his other projects and heard he did want to do straight up horror vs. his typical humor gigs. Good for him. He succeeded. While, technically, it's more 'thriller,' it definitely fits in the horror genre. With the horror market more than drenched in ghost/haunted house stories of the past decade, I applaud a filmmaker for thinking outside the box and making a horror movie for the rest of us. The Invitation and Who's Next? are just two other examples in recent years that impressed me instead of boring me with the same ole spooked spirit spin.While not groundbreaking or unpredictable, it's a fun little freaky tale that ends exactly how I had hoped it would. Well done, Peele. Come back. We need more ghostbustin' of the current horror trend.***Final thoughts: I happened to see another 'horror' movie today in the theatre: Alien: Covenant. Funny. Famous Director Ridley Scott helmed that 'horror' movie, but probably needs to contact Peele if he plans on making his next Alien movie actually scary.",8,9,17,20 May 2017
Drive," A Slow Transport
","If one could imagine an adult, much more serious and a helluva SLOWER version of the Jason Statham action movie, The Transporter, it'd be Drive.Critically acclaimed and further praise for one of my favorites, Ryan Gosling, were reasons for me wanting to see this. And I, too, will rave on how well made it was, shot, acted and contained some decent action sequences. Butit was so dammed slow, I could barely keep my head up to wade through 80% of the movie – the slow-paced scenes – to get to any promise of action as the plot indicated would happen.And what was with the pink opening credits?I digress. Much-too-quiet 'Driver' (Gosling) aids bad guy's getaways as a night job while managing a garage-shop day job and being a part-time movie stunt driver. How is ever to find time for romance? Especially with a married mother one apartment over? Obviously, he will, but he will also get caught up in both helping them and mixing with the wrong (mob) crowd.It's a fun movie, when it's moving – hence the title, but get ready for a snail's walk to get to something exciting. Yeah, I know I shan't be critiquing the movie for what it's not. It's not a Transporter reboot. But it's also not something I ever want to see again.",7,1,4,14 December 2011
Bolt," Bolt to see it
","Much like what 'Madagascar' did to penguins, so did 'Bolt' do to pigeons. I already knew I loved the pigeons from the previews, and they didn't disappoint. But unlike the 'Madagascar' penguins, the pigeons weren't the only highlight in 'Bolt.' They were just one of many wonderful things about this great movie (loved the Mittens' mobster scene.) Excellent action sequences (from minute one,) hilarious humor for both kids and adults, a touching story, stunning graphics (finally, a animated and accurate Las Vegas scene) and a die-hard hamster-fan named 'Rhino' all make 'Bolt' one of the year's best films. Sure, it mirrors Buzz's 'Toy Story' subplot and Jim Carrey's 'Truman Show'  but thankfully they move past that fast. And when they do, when they have the cat, Mittens, teach naïve TV-action hero, Bolt, how to be a regular dog, the movie turns into a tender and hilarious story. In a year that produced some excellent efforts in animated cinema ('Wall-E,' 'Kung Fu Panda' and 'Horton Hears a Who') I'm actually shocked Disney furthered the efforts with a wonderful story so full of action, comedy and heart. The only drawback was the predictability for anyone that's seen this same kind of storyline before, and the over-the-top dangerous finale they put the little girl (Penny  Miley Cyrus) in. Actually, that last complaint actually disturbed me a bit. Yes, we needed Bolt to come back to 'save the day' in a real and action packed way, but the irresponsibility the TV crew put her in, actually might be a little too much for (some of) the target audience this was meant to be seen. Other than that and as long as it's explained to little ones as fiction/pretend, it absolutely is a must see for adults and little ones.",8,1,3,23 January 2009
Frozen," Let it Ride
","After an incredibly slow first act and some below par and childishly written songs, Frozen actually finally takes off and left me pretty pleased by the finale.What worked best here the original take on the age-old Disney Princess animated feature. There was no grandiose villain, the conflicts were real and the love did show despite what I had thought the characters should've/would've done. Oh, and the stereotypical sidekick goofball character Disney loves to throw in wasn't exactly an original idea, but thanks to incredibly hilarious writing and ideas, I loved almost every minute the tiny snowman, Olaf, was on screen.Unfortunately, the movie was all ice capades for me. Despite the very long and sluggish start, my biggest problem was the music. For the majority, but one song – and that one, Let It Go, was just okay in the movie, the lyrics were so elementary and quietly frankly, unpleasant to my ears. These songs along with Olaf might have been there to please the younger audience, but not one soared to my expectations from these Disney Princess animated films.Luckily, it's easy to get past the songs since the majority of them are in the first half and it's the second half of the film that makes this movie ascend.After an accident involving a Princess's unexplained power to manipulate ice and cold, the King and Queen separates their two daughters from each other and the world for many years. Unrealistically, but then, this is a fantasy tale, the powerless Princess of the two clings to hope that she can be best friends again after many years of isolation and intentional avoidance.Once the years of seclusion are over, hell literally freezes over by the unresolved issues from the ice Queen. Will her sister save her from herself and the kingdom? Will they all thaw out? Will it ever be explained how some have powers, some bodies can break apart and others can rock and roll?Stick with the tale and it will, ah-hem, warm your heart by the ending. Not the best Disney/non-Pixar film in years – Tangled was much better, but still worth a watch. Just, bring a sweater.* * * Final thoughts: It was nice for Disney to go back to its roots in their classic format, but it was even better that they shook the story up and modernized their filmmaking. This was a smart, and definitely profitable, move to keep up with the other studios. I don't always praise Disney, but they did right here for the most part.",7,1,3,11 January 2014
2012," OMG2012 might happen. Actually, I'd rather die on 12/21/12 than watch this again.
","Funny. On a recent episode of Family Guy, Brian gets a earful of truth serum from Quagmire and the last thing (of many) Quagmire said was: 'You know what, I could forgive all of that, all of that, if you weren't such a bore.'I forgave a lot of what was wrong in 2012 but the one thing I couldn't bypass is that it was such a bore. And that was the one thing that surprised me the most. Even knowing it was way too long at over 2½ hours, I didn't expect such Pearl Harbor moments that made me yawn and wonder what the heck were they thinking?What I did know, was how silly it was from the 5-minute internet-released trailer. I figured I would laugh, or at least snicker at some of the scenes. I found myself doing that at more than one occasion, and it wasn't the blatant and unrealistic destruction scenes. It was just how bad this movie was, when they tried to show 'heart' or 'feeling' or 'warmth.' Or at the consistent 'near-misses' for our, uh, so-called, 'heroes.' Or the number of plane dipping.Despite the sometimes good special effects – I honestly can't justify giving it an extra half star for that due to the overwhelming negatives, I will say this in the movie's favor: I didn't snicker or laugh out loud as many times as I thought I would. (Side note: I watched both Twilight and The Happening because I was in the mood for a comedy and for the most part, I did laugh heartedly throughout those two films.) In this film, I was just simply bored. And also previously mentioned, this movie was so Pearl Harbor, where there were just a few scenes of mass-destruction, the reason people would want to see this mess or the reason they made it, and the rest was just plain awful. Awful, awful, awful and terribly bad.Shame on you, Cusack. Selling out. Again, that is. You could've been one of my all-time favorite actors. It all started going downhill since Con Air. Sure, he's had one or two good movies since, such as 1408. (Weird, perhaps he should choose more wisely for movie titles that contain only four digits.)Following Emmerich's very similar The Day After Tomorrow, a million things completely impossible happen within a matter of days. Here we have the very wrong theory of 12/21/12 where the Mayan calendar ends and the world as we know it shifts axis, thus destroying all mankind and man's kind of civilization. Enter in the very stereotypical divorced dad (Cusack here, Quaid in Tomorrow) and his ex, his kids, the new beauthe whole cast is recycled sitcom/disaster-movie characters.Butthat's not what you bought a ticket for, right? It was to see big explosions. Am I right? Well, unfortunately, they're so few and far between, it's hard to justify a recommendation – heck, it's like 40+ minutes before anything happens. And what's worse, is the fake 'heart-filled' scenes and really, really, REALLY bad jokes and puns.Okay, this movie is fairly, make that enormously easy to ridicule. It wasn't made to earn Oscars – though I am sure it's going to be up for special effects, but come on. Try a little bit. Try to show real emotion, real dialogue, real people. Do something memorable.I expect this out of Michael Bay. He cares more about using gasoline to explode stuff than character development, genuine thrills, emotion and plot development. Though Emmerich is only a half a step higher, he will genuinely win the contests between the two buffoons. Here, he not only matches Bay's horrible movie-making qualities, he almost takes the prize away from Transformers 2 as the worst of 2009.To sum up, this movie is all disaster movies in one: Armageddon, The Day After Tomorrow, Poseidon, Pearl Harbor, Independence Day, Deep Impact, Dante's Peak and many more. Heck, it mimicked Wall-E, and I should be shot for stating that. It has horrible acting, clichés (oh, the clichés!), dialogue, comedy and thee most unrealistic scenes of flight ever on film. I mean, really, how many lives do these nobodies have? How many times do we have to see a plane dip? Seriously, how many coincidences and luck-outs do this boring broken family have?I think this was sincerely made for only two types of people: those who actually believe 12/21/12 is the end (ha ha ha ha ha – I've said this before, but I sincerely don't believe in this 'end of time' conspiracy theory, but even if I am wrong, I'll be dead with everyone else, so who cares?) and for those who just blindly want to see millions die as buildings collide. To each their own, but I appreciate a movie-goer who appreciates film as an art and not as mindless special effects engine.And the joke's on you people. Both kinds. But, speaking specifically to the later group, you'll get like maybe 30 minutes out of 158 of what you paid your money for. I'm glad you'll have to suffer through the rest, for the low taste you have.(Okay, that last part was harsh. Again, to each their own. But each ticket sold – like the never-ending Saw series, justifies these crappy movies. I have made it a point to cease watching the Saw movies for this very reason: I have to stop being part of the problem. For the money I spend, I expect more. And with less tickets sold, Hollywood might actually take notice.)",1,27,47,2 December 2009
Ghost Rider," Blaze of Borey
","With the sequel, 5-years late and quite obviously just another paycheck-grab for broke Nicolas Cage, heading to theatres in a few weeks, I thought I would see the original 'Ghost Rider' (2/10 Stars) for the very first time. I never wanted to before, based solely on my distaste of Cage and the movie looked downright silly. I was right: the flaming head of Hellboy on Wheels was outrageously cornybut let's look beyond that, shall we? Incredibly misconstrued and too complex script, laughable acting – especially the fake looking Cage (namely, when he wasn't CGI'd to death and still human), terrible dialogue, bad guys that look so hilarious when demonized that you want to develop a drinking game bases solely on them and awful and uninspired camera shots. I never thought many super-hero movies would come close to the travesty 'Daredevil' was, but this one seemed to ride all over it. Did I mention it was just shy of two hours, a full half-hour longer than it needed to be? I'll admit, I was confused throughout with about six characters and their separate motivations, but it was the writer's job in what's supposed to be a simple comic-book character to make it accessible by the end. I guess you can say no to the Devil per YOUR OWN CONTRACT with him and then use the same powers he gave you to 'fight' the wrong-doers? Or why would he want to? Or why does the 'curse' come out only at night, but then shadows work too? And when did certain people become 'innocent' – everyone's guilty of some sin – if we're supposed to go with the Bible like this is preaching? When the credits rolled I had multiple questions unanswered but the biggest was: why didn't I listen to my initial gut reaction and never see this?",2,0,1,5 February 2012
X-Men: The Last Stand," Stand against violence
","Originally, I didn't like X-Men: The Last Stand. Today, I watched it again and it's still my third favorite of the original 3. (It goes: X2: X-Men United, then X-Men and finally X-Men: The Last Stand.) However, what I originally gave 2 or 2½ stars turned, tonight, to 4/5 stars.) Why? (Spoiler alerts following. It's so hard as the expert journalist I think I am to avoid giving away the major points in order to review. So, if spoilers aren't your bag (baby) then skip to lifesaboxofchocolates.com.) So many mutants and humans (or homosapiens) die. This is NOT your childhood, your Superman: The Movie. This is WAR. An adult comic book movie, as if this could 'really' happen. So there will always be causalities. Does that mean, I have to like it? No. I don't want to see the majority die or get 'cured.' Oh, sorry, that's another spoiler.Humans have developed a 'cure' for the common mutant in the form of awell, mutant. That little mutant boy, Leech (or Jimmy (Bright)) is capable of transforming any mutant into, well one of them, orus (humans.) Naturally, there are those against it, namely Magneto (so wonderfully played again by McKellen) and his 'brotherhood' of mutants-against-change.Meanwhile, and this is another major plot-point, Jean Grey (Janssen) is back, but now as 'Phoenix.' Hey, that's where I live. That was bad. Sorry. Anyways, her split personality is weighing heavily on multiple sources: Wolverine (Jackman) who loves her, Cyclops (Marsden) who mourns her, Xavier (Stewart) who wants to help her and Magneto who wants to, uh, evolve her.Sure there are more subplots roaming. But, suffice to say, I loved the fact we left Wolverine's backdrop behind, Rogue (as annoying as she isin all three original features) is only minimal, and the action was intense, when it did happen. Hates? Well that a huge amount of mutants either got evaporated – and I won't spoil who, or 'cured.' Stick around for the before-and-after credits for some nice surprises.Also, the bridge moving scene went on for far too long and was a completely unnecessarily (CGI-excuse) scene as Magneto could've easily lifted everyone over via metal slab.Fine, (since I'm still p*ssed) I'll give away one transformation I didn't care for: Mystique (Romijn.) She was definitely one of my favorites in the first two chapters and could've been used here more.If you liked the first two, this is definitely worth a shot/viewing. It's not perfect, and suffers from a lot of the same old comic-book/sequel dilemmas: too much, too late. And it's very violent for a 'comic-book/super-hero' movie. It's not for smaller kids. I admired that 'stand' against the norm. Watch it. And, again, stay through the credits Side Note: and I wish they would stop that. It's definitely no fun to stay through a 2 hour movie, wait 4-9 minutes for the credits to finish so you can see an additional 20 seconds. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's marketing or attempts to get you to read/see all the people involved. But it's annoying. Seriously.",7,0,1,13 May 2010
Room," No Room for Improvement
","I knew I was wrong, but I avoided this movie for so long because I couldn't help but think it was somehow associated with 2003's The Room. A sequel, remake, reboot, whateverthat unintentionally hilarious, albeit awful Tommy Wiseau film from 13 years ago still haunts me.And now, this 2015 film haunts me. Only, in a much different way.Other than my own dumb fears about the similar title, I knew almost zero about it going in, and I would like to try and keep my review to the bare minimum for anyone else who hasn't seen it. In fact, if you have NOT seen it, and you absolutely MUST, stop now, bookmark this and return. I won't spoil anything significant, but even knowing more than me going in, or about 1%, is too much.Okay, you're back? Good. Here goes, to the best of my ability, my effort to non-spoil this.Getting the synopsis out of the way might help explain my thoughts and feeling following. Movie opens with a mother and her child in a small room. Within minutes, or less, you realize that is their world. As expected, more and more is revealed on how they came to live in such a small room. And for how long. Too long. It also becomes apparent that the boy knows of nothing else IN HIS ENTIRE EXISTENCE but 'Room.' Or the mysterious man that enters nightly, brings 'presents' on Sundays and is not allowed to see.Annnd, I'll stop there. There's so much more I want to say. Feelings, emotions, fear, anger, hate, longing and ideas on how to solve the problem. That last onethat's just me. I'm always trying to put myself in the character's shoes and attempt to fix whatever problem, or plainly, 'what would I dobetter?' After some ideas, luckily, I realized: I am NOT in her shoes. I never experienced what she went through. I doubt 0.00000001% of the world's souls ever has. So, I'm glad I could shut down the 'obvious solutions' to this mother and son's imprisonment. So, there you go. The movie's about a kidnapped mother and her son in a tiny room. How would you cope? How would you care for your child when all he knows is those four walls? How would you escapeif you ever could? How would a five-year-old experience the real worldif he never has before?This movie is harrowing, magnificent, brilliant, tough, original and has some of the best acting I've seen in years. Of course, Brie 'Mother' Larson was fantastic. Never once did I not believe her, she was as real as it gets. But, damn, that boy, (at the time of filming) 8-year-old Jacob Tremblay was incredible. I did love his mother's performance, but multiply that by two for Tremblay. You can't help but be captivated for what he has to go through, or learn about 'the real world' outside of Room.The other performances were solid – ALWAYS love me some Joan Allen – as was the cinematography, score, directioneverything. I can barely think of one thing I didn't like here. Okay, well, maybe one thingEven though I still grant this movie my highest honor: 10 out of 10 stars and it does nab my top pick of the eight Oscar nominated Best Pictures of 2015 so far (still have yet to see Bridge of Spies and Brooklyn,) my only complaint is that I wanted to know more. More of the aftermath, and the details of what's outside Room.Guess I need to go buy the book this is based on. My one gripe, which really isn't a complaint, isn't enough to lessen how incredible my experience was with this movie and how perfectly it was shot and performed. You must see Room.Um, to clarify, don't see 'The' Room. Just 'Room.'",10,2,7,15 January 2016
A Quiet Place," What's The Frequency, Johnathan
","Talk about effective: I held my own breath, wouldn't speak out loud and made as little noise as possible while watching this. And even way after the movie! THAT'S AMAZING.Oh, and I picked up a few more sign language motions along the way.I knew I'd like this, but had no idea how much. This enormously suspenseful, nail-biting, deep and original horror movie needs to be seen by all. Us horror fans wait years for THE RIGHT ONE to come along and, well, here we go.Egad! There are unexplained monsters on the loose! Unlike the fear pick-me-ups from the terrible After Earth, these just listen for the slightest, and I mean SLIGHTEST of noises to attack and devour. So enter: American Family who's lucky enough to survive over a year since the attack from unknown creatures. Especially after what you see the parents have to put up with.Yes, it's truly amazing American Mom/Dad have survived over a year with their kids: a scared brother, a rebellious deaf girl, a starry-eyed little boy and another on the way. Truly, this Mom and Pop deserve parents of the year awards.But, I digress. This movie centers on one really bad/heartbreakingly long day of their survival with every minute that passes. Try to live their day without white-knuckling your way to the end.Funny, I just got done watching 1927's Metropolis for the first time, a silent masterpiece about a hundred years before it's time. I watched the restored edition which still left out a ton of title cards of the dialogue and that left a minimum of two-thirds of the dialogue unspoken. It was up to me, the audience, to figure out what's being said as the Silent Actors went on and on with only-seen verbiage. I managed to get most of what they said, thanks to some purposely over-acting. Here, if I didn't have subtitles, I'd be lost on their sign language. But, it would be interesting to watch this movie again without subtitles and see if I can follow along. The movie really does have enough power to let us know what's going on without knowing all that's said. Or unsaid.Now, that all said...the movie's not without its flaws. But maybe, it's mostly me that has the problem. For one: these kids are absolutely old enough to understand the severity of making a noise and why the hell did no one set a trap for the bad creatures? How did more than a year pass that they were no better off with a defense against 'aliens' that have such obvious defects and weaknesses?Well, the movie DOES establish the most minute sound does draw in the blood-thirsty villains, so I will give them some credit that the new norm: no sound, isn't as easy as someone watching this comfortably from their bedroom. But still...HIGHLY recommended. It's nice they're still making SOME right choices in horror and not making EVERY SINGLE ONE these days about ghosts or haunted houses. I mean, like...seriously. There are more subgenres of horror out there than just the freaking supernatural! I know it's cheap (note: not just inexpensive) but it's unoriginal at this point. We need more horror films such as this.Thank you, John(athon) Krasinski. Jim, for short?***Final thoughts: Kinda makes the case for Pro-Choice...but, well, you'll see.",9,0,0,5 August 2018
The Bourne Legacy," The Boring Legacy
","There should have only been one.By the time the overlong 135 minute The Bourne Legacy realizes that it's an unwelcomed addition to the best trilogy in the history of cinema, it completes its minuscule 20 minutes of uninspired action roughly 2 minutes before the credits roll. If, in lieu of action, they wanted this as a 'thinking person's' thriller, they also failed on that, as this was one of the most basic films, spy or not, I've seen in quite awhile.Sowhat are we left with? Great performances? No. Plot twists? Nada. Surprises? Nope. Decent cinematography? Okay, it gets that for its hour-long stroll through the snowy Alaskan territory. In addition, I will say, after several mediocre Edward Norton performances, he stepped it up this time.Sadly, I cannot say the same for one of my favorite actors and the person that was supposed to carry this feature: Jeremy Renner. I've been a fan of his for a decade now and he always seems to be getting better and improving himself and the roles he takes on. Well, no one's perfect and he took a giant leap back here. Mercifully, as the movie closed – and the end was welcomed, by the way, he did step up his game, but only so slightly. Overall, Renner's Aaron Cross wasn't just the faux pas Bourne-spy; his role was literally an idiot that appeared more lucky at times than actually trained.The 3-minute-plot boils down to the final days of the true Bourne legacy when the big bad government is permanently shutting down all the programs surrounding the super-spies. On the target screen is semi-spy Cross and he nearly escapes assassination only to be worried about his drug addiction. (Don't ask; I've already gone too far...) He does team up with another nearly assassinated doctor of the program and together they're somewhat tracked with ten times less the suspense and awesomeness found in the original Bourne trilogy.It thoroughly goes without typing that this chapter was as needed as Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was. But, that's the bottom line fact. While not the worst movie I've seen, it is 100% unnecessary and felt like one very, VERY long deleted scene from the original films. Hell, even the action and fighting were so amateurish that it's an insult to stamp Bourne's name on this and not just name it Cross.They should have; you will feel cross when you leave the cinema.",2,25,51,11 August 2012
School of Rock," Schooled
","For a movie that started off as clichéd as possible and just pure fantasy – this would NEVER happen – the move was one of those rare experiences that got progressively better and funnier. Sure, it kept its, ah-hem, theme, but it did improve and absolutely worth the whole experience to get to the finale. Not to mention, the kids did great in their roles. Butthat all said, overall, the number one best quality was Jack Black himself. His chemistry with the kids, his enthusiasm and belief in this, wasn't just charming and contagious, it was sorely welcomed in this kind of age-old comedy. My only regret: it took me this long to finally see it. In the great words of Kevin Carr: It totally ROCKED!",8,3,4,1 May 2015
Cars 2," Cars 2: No Electric Boogaloo
","The nicest thing I can say about the Cars 2 is that it's not the worst movie of 2011it's only the biggest disappointment.Pixar is usually untouchable and makes near to perfect masterpieces. While the original Cars was rather weak, at least that had heart.This genre-changed lemon actually dropped further and it only helps if you like Red-Necked humor (I don't) and enjoy 'The Doofus Spy Who Knew Too Little' variety.Much like The Cleveland Show, they spun off the wrong character. While, it's technically not a spin off, the focus was on the wrong character for a sequel. That's like making Superman II all about Jimmy. Really?For ages 2 and under. 1½/5 Stars.",2,2,3,1 December 2012
The Game," I'm not much of a video-game player, but I would love to play this GAME
","(Despite my efforts, this review contains spoilers. Please completely avoid reading this, or ANY review, until you see it. But to sum up my own review: YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE. Okay, then read my review. At least, I didn't say you MUST READ MY REVIEW. That part's optional.) The Game was very close to receiving the rare 5/5 star rating. What held it back to 4½ stars was the very ending, meaning the last 1½ minutes that were slightly 'off' and the repeat-viewing dilemma. I'll explain: The entire movie is one surprise after another leading up to a shocking finale and after one viewing, the entire suspense is, well, gone. And I'm not talking about just finding out Luke is Darth's son or the ending to Planet of the Apes. Heck, Fight Club also enjoyed its twist ending, but regardless of that revelation, you can watch that over and over. In this case, we're talking the entire movie.Whew, the negative I hate to start on, is over. The Game is a great, suspenseful, fun, ingenious, crafty and original film. It's also funny, namely in the beginning. And to top it off, it's got excellent performances from both Unger and Douglas – who rarely lets me down. In fact, this is one of the top five best movies he's done. In a role that could've been easily played by someone 'confused' on what was going on, Douglas added so much depth. You think you know him as a ruthless, soulless Wall Street tycoon, who's used to bullying people to his own needs, but as he breaks down in this movie, you really see the onion being peeled. In fact, I think the most underrated aspect of this movie, as good as the whole was, was Douglas's masterful performance as a lost soul who needs it back.Douglas plays Nicholas, someone so rich (through both inheritance and his own determination later in life as a huge multibillion-dollar money-pusher) that even Bruce Wayne would ask him for a loan. It's shown early on that his father took his own life, I guess greed is not always, for lack of a better term, good. Nicholas is stuck fathering the young brother who grows into Penn, or Conrad. Due to these critical plot points – no spoiler, this is like in the first few minutes – Nicky never has a childhood, nor enjoyed life. But Conrad sure as heck did.In what seems like a normal rehab, begging for money visit from Conrad, Nicholas is presented a gift from CRS from Conrad. Reluctantly, Nicholas coincidentally falls right into the CRS office and begins, what else?, the GAME.The movie then turns very Total Recall-ish, but saved by reality and the real-life settings (all over the continent) and performances. Nicholas doesn't know what is real, or what is fake, neither does the audience who just sat back to enjoy the enormously fun ride Nicholas has to endure to solve or even survive the GAME.Nicholas eventually befriends Christine (Unger) who may/may not know what's going on. When I say befriends, I mean, he thinks she's part of the gameHeck, it's hard to give anything away. Just watch this movie. Anything I reveal can be considered a spoiler. So, if you like mystery, suspense, action, adventure, Douglas and the great style and art of Director Fincher, you must watch this movie and explore and be intrigued by every minute, turn, twist and revolution.Side Note: I wish I could go on, namely how unrealistic I found everything to be the first time. Really think about it when you finish, think about the tests andI've said too much. Watch this movie!",9,0,1,17 December 2009
Kick-Ass," Kicked Watchmen's Ass!
","How dumb would it be to start my review with: Kick-Ass Kicked Ass! But it did. It's my highest rated movie (so-far) of 2010, so I have to start on a positive note, however obvious and clichéd.This wildly original, exciting, funny and suspenseful movie is the movie I wanted to see in Watchmen. Both are HARD-R films, both are ADULT-oriented comic-book adventures and both involve a masked adventurer that's eerily too close to coping Batman. (In Kick-Ass's defense, they were trying to spoof, while Watchmen simply ripped Batman off.) But, only Kick-Ass succeeded in adding both fantasy and enjoyment, shock without revolting and dialogue worth quoting.The movie starts brilliantly by telling you immediately this is the Family Guy of comic-book movies, orit looks like its good for kids, but far from it. (SEE: the 'leap of faith' and Dave's (Johnson) first fantasy, prior to being a superhero.) He's just a normal, high-school geek, horny for girls (old and young alike) and have equally standing buddies. A la Peter Parker. His 'brilliant idea' is to become a masked superhero, or 'Kick-Ass,' to do what most people won't: help those in need or when attacked.It doesn't go as planned, and they perfectly show the realism if this were to happen. All that happens to him during his 'training' made me kept thinking these must be dreams, but they were for real.Finally he gets his big break while somewhat fighting off three thugs and becoming an internet sensation. This prompts other 'superheroes' to take to the streets, but with far greater motivations. Big Daddy (Cage) is the Batman-wannabe, and anyone that thinks he's a rip-off, think of the homage he's playing in addition to the refreshing site of someone that's playing the fake-Batman from The Dark Knight's opening: a gun totting and lethal/killer Batman. His daughter, Hitgirl (Moretz) has her own background story, but in the present she's a daddy's little girl and is perfectly willing to do anything he says or does when it comes to murder, death or slicing & dicing.Eventually they meet, but Kick-Ass's over his head. He gets his girl and an Incredibles's Syndrome knockoff sidekick Red Mist (Plasse) with definite ulterior motives of his own. (If you caught the Syndrome reference, then you pretty much know what kind of character he is.) The movie certainly goes into familiar territory with the finale/outcome/climax, but since you already know what type of movie this is 10 minutes in, you can just sit back and enjoy the adventure and fun.I did like Johnson as he did what he needed to in his role. Plasse showed again he had little range outside of his normal McLovin role from Superbad. So, if you like him in that role, you'll enjoy him here again. I'm not a Nicolas Cage fan, though I don't hate him or his acting. Here, I loved what he did with the faux-pas Batman, especially the voice.While Cage stood out, but the number one star of the movie was Moretz. I heard a lot about her 'offensive' and 'vulgar' character prior. To me, she was wildly original and out-acted the entire cast with her depth and emotion. As realistic as most of the movie was, she was over-the-top, and that wasn't a bad thing. I enjoyed every second she was on screen, especially when she pulled off Kill Bill Vol. 1's Gogo Yubari role as the sweet little terror. (I also loved it when Puss In Boots did this in Shrek 2.) Recently I learned she is to play the main role in the Americanized remake Let Me In from the original Let the Right One In. I already looked forward to the reboot, but now I can't wait to see it.As I've pointed out, there's tons of references (and probably dozens more I left out) to other films. I didn't have a problem with that. It was nice to see them all in a fresh and real-life setting. The movie blends what real kids do, i.e. Facebook.I acknowledge the movie isn't perfect as there's a balance problem where they seemed like they had too many ideas on the table and the film moved from one mood to the next and sometimes without ease. In addition, it was easy to see how (most, not all) the scenes would play out. Nevertheless, I was entertained from the get-go and it never let up or let me down.This is a highly recommended super-hero movie (It even had a great soundtrack) and I'm sad to see it didn't do well with the box office, though I understand it's definitely geared to a specific audience.Side Note: I haven't had a feeling for a low-brow/Spring released movie like this since Lucky Number Slevin four years ago. Coincidentally, neither made the money they deserved and I make no apologies for the love I have for both of these movies. I felt both had great dialogue, humorous scenes, good action and most importantly for my taste: originality.Side Note 2: Contradictory to my normal criticisms and reviews, I really enjoyed the character of Hitgirl. Normally, I'd be all over the abuse of a child and ranting about CPS, etc, but since pretty much her role was so wrapped in fantasy, it was easier to see her as fiction and not a child being put in such peril as would normally offend me.",9,5,14,15 May 2010
Unknown," Unfortunately
","It's Unknown how many people actually saw this good movie. Ha – sorry.Let's officially begin with: I liked this movie. Sure, it's comparable to Taken, but beyond the lead star, Liam Neeson and that it's an American/international thriller, they couldn't be further apart. It's tight (under two hours,) the suspense builds all the way to the closing credits and it's beautifully shot.While attending a conference in Berlin, Dr. Martin Harris (Neeson) and wifey Elizabeth (January Jones) an accident leaves Martin in a coma. When he does awake from the coma – oooh, that's not part of the suspense, but I'm glad you were on your toes – his wife doesn't recognize him. Worse, there's another Dr. Martin Harris!He may be wrong himself about who he is, due to the head injury he suffered when his cab went into the water. Only the (of course, beautiful female) cab driver, Gina, (Diane Kruger) can help him rediscover his roots and why people are trying to, wait for itkill him!The movie plays out on that premise and Martin has to put the pieces together, just as the audience until the finale revolutions.It's not perfect, in fact, for the most part, it seems soamateurish. I'm referring to the reasons behind everyone's motivations and the number of players involved. It felt like a sophomoric project, as if the writers had completed their initial independent film and they're on their way. Perhaps, they will besome day.It is very light entertainment with some good action scenes – but DO NOT let the advertisements fool you: (again) this is NOT Taken, this is NOT action-packed. In fact, despite what the movie is, I really did want his Bryan Mills (From Taken) to show his stuff and kick butt. Alas, it's not that movie.",7,2,3,26 June 2011
Ghostbusters," Cats & DogsLived Together
","Every time I sit down to revisit Ghostbusters, and that's not too often, sadly, I keep forgetting how incredible and richly funny this movie was. So much so, it should never be considered an adventure or supernatural action movie up front; it should, by and far, be under the comedy section. And I'm not just talking about the key and well-known shots as the funniest ones occur when there's barely anything on screen but Bill Murray's comic genius delivery.While I might have seen this in theatres – I was only ten when released, I don't recall. Unfortunately, my family viewed very few films back in the early eighties and I didn't start my movie obsession until the late eighties. I know I caught it somewhere, sometime following the release and did like it, but never, ever appreciated it until I got older. I don't think I was alone in that appreciation of this fantastic film.Yes, the movie made a ton. Sure, it was a bona fide summer blockbuster. But, I think people just expected such quality back then, they probably had no idea how influential, how deep the lines and comedy was or the impact. For, I see dozens of summer movies over the past and recent decade or so, that are strictly made for profit. Made to be released, one after the next, while not caring it will fizzle after a couple of weeks to a month and then featured in a Redbox a couple of months later. Movies with very little heart inserted, too much CGI and less care taken. Despite just 'being a comedy,' Ghostbusters was made correctly, down to the core.Three paranormal doctors/buddies at a university find themselves out on the street in New York just as their ghost theories become reality. Hilariously gathering the funds to make it big in the Big Apple, they open the Ghostbusters pest control business and take offeventually.One of their first clients is Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver,) a tough, but vulnerable broad who has an extra visitor in her refrigerator. While 1/3 'Buster at the time, Peter (Murray,) is more infatuated with her than her ghost fridge, they do follow up on her story while simultaneously capturing ghosts in the city and rise to fame.Her storyline might be more of final clue for the upside in business for the Ghostbusters and then things get real.Above all else in this movie was the flawless performance from Murray. While every single actor involved was also fantastic, namely Harold Ramis as Egon and Weaver's Dana, Murray's Peter was pitch-perfect. His deadpan humor was so great, that I almost feel guilty for not appreciating Dan Aykroyd's Raymond role more, or Rick Moranis and Annie Potts in their third-tier, but important characters.Don't get me wrong; on the whole, they all did great. I just couldn't keep my focus much further than Murray during this film.Beyond Murray and the wonderful supporting cast, was the infamous and beloved title song ('in' due to the countless times it was played,) a good score, special effects decent for the times and fairly good cinematography.This movie screamed what I love about Summer Blockbusters, but haven't seen in about two decades. Sure, there have been plenty of great films; fun and exciting and memorable films. But, rarely will I see one that's more heart than just trying for the Box Office dollar. I miss these types of movies.Well, I don't have to any more. For, I bought this one on BluRay and can revisit the 'good ole days' any time I feel like it. Recommended!",10,1,1,3 May 2013
Gran Torino," Million Dollar Gent
","Though a huge fan of film, I didn't grow up loving or even seeing a Clint Eastwood feature until 'Unforgiven.' I was an instant admirer of his work. Since then, he's rarely let me down, and catching up on Dirty Harry, I saw what I was missing. However, that being said, he surely has gotten better with age, and with every movie. Take 'Million Dollar Baby,' a near masterpiece. 'Gran Torino' is definitely short of that, but still a wonderful, actually suspenseful at times and often hilarious film, with a fantastic performance by Eastwood, but unfortunately, unlike 'Baby,' everyone else seems wooden. This might be due to the fact 'Torino' was being made during breaks from his other film 'Changeling.' Either way, Eastwood stands out again and it was wonderful seeing someone completely un-PC (God, I'm sick of PC) even if it's just a fictional character. So anyone easily offended by language and bigotry (the latter I'm very much familiar with), you have fair warning this contains its full share. But, for those with open minds/hearts: 'Torino' is a definite must see even if it's not a completely original story about a gruff older gent that (no real spoiler here) changes his ways. I think they set out to make a small film, but I can see this little film lasting generations.",8,1,7,26 December 2008
The Hurt Locker," Hurt Some More
","War movies have never been my cup of tea, but I decided to give 'The Hurt Locker' a shot (after enormously high ratings and after watching the horrid 'Stop-Loss.') I wasn't disappointed. It had excellent acting – Renner should be nominated for an Oscar, completely believable surroundings, sounds and action and mostly, it was on-the-edge suspenseful. Granted, 1-2 deaths were absolutely predictable (the one in the beginning was such a set up, I unfortunately thought of 'Cliffhanger's opening,) the rest of the solders, you have no idea if they'll live or die, and that's the point of this movie/war. I truly felt as if I was there, and sadly, I had to compare this to my own job that I don't particularly care for. The obvious 'Okay, I guess my job/life ain't that bad' thoughts surfaced. We have a ('Lethal Weapon's Martin Riggs) newcomer/replacement (Renner) after the previously mentioned death of a bomb expert dies. His cowboy, caution-to-the-wind attitude not only upsets his comrades, they want to put an end to it. All the while they spend most of their time deciphering between who's a friendly and who's an insurgent. I don't think any recent war movie I've seen truly made me feel even more respect (although, I felt I already had the highest respect for the U.S. armed forces) and more gratitude that I live in a country so completely unlike any Middle Eastern country. Definitively see 'Locker.' Despite the hate it shows humans show other humans, it really makes you appreciate life all the more. Side note: coincidentally enough, both 'Stop-Loss' and 'Locker' were both modern-war films, directed by women and showed a true enemy: man. However, while you can take 'Locker' serious and learn something from it, the same can't be said by the 'MTV Movie'/music video 'Loss.'",8,19,29,27 June 2009
X-Men: Apocalypse," It Gets Better
","The joke in the movie about part threes being the worst of their series might be talking about the original X-Men trilogy (and a jab against Director Singer not at the helm of The Last Stand) but it certainly applies here, as well.X-Men: Apocalypse, hopefully the conclusion of the X-Babies set, was okay to begin with. Just the run of the mill X-Men movie and was followed by more the same: younger cast recruiting and developing other mutant powers. And then the second half kicked in and it did get better.Still the movie 'reboot' series seems to have run its course. I think I, like the movie watching public (SEE: Box Office receipts,) have had its fill of the 'newbies' learning to work together, fight, learn to work together again and repeat. Time for yet another reboot, hopefully including a merger with Disney and the Avengers. Now who wouldn't wanna see that?Oh, and this movie? Well, like Blade: Trinity, they pull out the big gun from thousands of years ago in the form of Apocalypse who just wants to wipe the slate clean. Will the troubled X-Men work together to defeat him?The movie has so many problems in the first half, but makes up for it so much in the second half that the movie's actually recommended. Still think they should end it here. We're just backpedaling over and over repetitive ground. ***Final thoughts: Not really spoiler since the trailer gave it away, but Wolverine's appearance was actually one of the best scenes of the movie and makes way for a fantastic R-Rated Wolverine movie. Funny, he had no lines, was in the movie for probably a 50th of the running time and yet, got me psyched for the next Wolverine Rated-R film. Snikt!",5,0,9,12 June 2016
Ex Machina," Take that, Spielberg
","Recently, I crossed A.I. Artificial Intelligence off my bucket list and wasn't pleased I saw it after all. I would've been better off passing before I viewed it. Mercifully, 14 years later, an A.I. film was done properly.Throughout this film, I felt hope for real cinema, or at least a return to well-made and thoughtful productions. Beautifully shot, inside and in the outside world, Ex Machina really took me into the minds of madness, even as subtle as the film is. It's a great Twilight Zone episode, but with time to appreciate the words spoken, ideas presented and claustrophobic nature shown. I loved the main 'villain,' the depth and dialogue of thoughts that I thought first and they agreed with me. One big problem with a movie like this is that it constantly tells us how smart it and the characters are, and yet, I only believe it at certain times. It's the old: Show Don't Tell theory. 'The Tester,' or Domhnall Gleeson's Caleb, is continuously referred to as brilliant, but aside from a bit jargon, I never bought his intelligence. Partly, that was the point, I guess, but it's hard to get past the prodigy he's supposed to be.Nevertheless, I loved the concepts, the direction, the scope and definitely the third act. Completely recommended. Cheers!",8,2,5,2 August 2015
Back to the Future Part III," Doubleback to the Past again
","As much as I used to dislike Westerns, I actually put off the conclusion to the 'Back to the Future' trilogy a bit. Granted, 'III' is not a real western, but it did take place in the 'old west,' contained high-noon gunfights, saloons, cowboys, Indians, immigrants, sheriffs, the whole hoe-downs. More of a spoof of Clint Eastwood's older fare, including using his name as an alias, 'III' did, successfully bring back the series to the original roots: barely any time travel (in a time traveling movie), a much slower pace than 'II,' even a theme song – ZZ Top's 'Doubleback' which I grew to love as much as 'I's Huey Lewis & the News's 'Power of Love.' That being said, it really wasn't that great of a film, though not terrible by any means. Gone, still, is the heart and soul 'I' had. Doc Brown and Marty must 'push' the DeLorean up to 88 MPH to, once again, get 'back to the future.' But wait, Doc has fallen in love for the first time, so conflict arises if he should use his head or heart at the same time Marty (still the 'Dick Clark' eternal teenager) must stop freaking out when someone calls him 'chicken.' Sure, I know it's the teenager's time to grow up (mentally, that is, as he looks fully grown by now) but that 'Nobody calls me chicken, or yella!' first introduced in 'II' gets old really fast. I strongly admired 'II's clever closing overlapping the finale of 'I' and 'II,' which to my recollection, hasn't even been done. Unfortunately, 'Part III' really dropped the ball with an incredibly unrealistic, overlong rescue scene on a train. Granted, we're dealing with fictional time-travel, but the perfectly aimed hover board was a bit overboard.",5,0,4,5 July 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Bicurious Button
","Here's a phrase I rarely use: 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' is one of the most overrated movies of the year, as 'Atonement' was last year. What easily could have been a 'Forrest Gump' remake, 'Button' stars Brad Pitt as a man aging backwards  interesting concept enough, but thoroughly uninteresting, spiteful character. By the end of the film, all that we gathered was that he liked playing the piano, alcohol and sex with multiple women, married or not, despite having a 'Jenny' (from 'Forrest') complex for Cate Blanchett (who, coincidentally, also doesn't mind fooling around while married.) I believe the movie was trying to be the next 'Forrest' but failed on many counts, including lack of heart and (interesting) characters to believe in or care about. I could never get into Pitt's character, as he starts out wholesome as 'Forrest' but then shows a completely aimless, selfish and shallow personality. And one of the things that irked me the most, just when he had everything he ever wanted, he leaves due to his 'condition' of aging backwards, when I knew then, and the final half hour proved, he had plenty of time left with the life he would leave behind. If this was supposed to be a lesson in 'acceptance' for differences in people, he learned basically nothing in his extremely meaningless life. And the worse scenes involved a speech-impaired Blanchett (not telling, but) listening to the 'Button' story. 'Titanic' got it right by narrowing its 'older-Rose' scenes to but a few, not every 10 minutes. Now, the good: the special effects, background sets, score and cinematography were excellent, as they were for 'Atonement.' Overall, neither was terrible, but lacked the heart that would make them great movies.",4,1,3,4 January 2009
Transformers," Autobots! Transform into Go-Bots!
","Perhaps they should've gone with: 'Go-Bots: The Movie' because 'Transformers,' this ain't. I grew up on the original series/toys/movie/comics, even the United Kingdom ones. They changed so much in this; I don't know where to begin. Bumblebee was a VW Bug not a Camero, the boy's name was Spike not Sam, Megatron was a gun not a jet and transformers had their shape and that was it – they couldn't merely look at something to change to. I have never had so many 'WTF' moments as I did in this horrible, treacherous insult to humans. Again Michael Bay shows why humans don't deserve to continue on. Sure, I would wanted to agree with all those brainless 'Oh, it's just a popcorn movie, just enjoy' comments, and I've tried, believe me. But this movie was an insult. From the shameless product placements (every 2-3 minutes,) to the horrid dialogue, to the downright juvenile script, I wanted to throw up throughout. 'This is such a felony!' and Shia's insistent repeating the same words multiple times; by God, if I heard 'No! No! No! 10x' or 'Go! Go! 6x' etc – you get the drift – one more time, I'd break his other hand. And the so called comedy elements (see the Johnny 5/JarJar/Spider transformer hiding while holding one hand up as if a 2-year-old; are you flipping serious? I wanted to think the incredibly bad humor was for minors until they threw in a masturbation conversation (another 'WTF' moment.) I even despised George Bush, and when they attempted roast him, I felt sorry for him. Oh, and Megatron & Starscream are both MAJOR characters. Who's brilliant idea was to introduce them in the last ¼ of the film? Big budgeted movies do NOT have to be so DUMB. SEE: 'Bourne' Trilogy, 'Dark Knight' for evidence.Side Note: This was one of my favorites. The military's wonderful idea to hide this All-Spark was to hide it in a big city with lots of expensive property, buildings and best yet, innocent bystanders. Yes, I know it's a cheap shot in bringing another big-no-brain action sequence to a city surrounding - No, Michael Bay, we're not all stupid. But, this is the perfect example of a WAY dumbed down script aimed at the 3-4 year olds. This is like giving a real life Syndrome (From Pixar's 'The Incredibles') a blank check to make a movie.",2,1,3,25 June 2009
Men in Black II," Who let this Dog out?
","Much like Speed 2: Cruise Control, the sequel Men in Black II went down near the top of the list of all-time drops in quality from the original. This movie sucked.I'll admit some of the humor and special effects were good. That part accounted for 3% of the entire movie. So, math buffs, that means 97% or an overwhelming majority of the so-called comedy lines and special effects were just plain awful. What a giant step backward from the creativity in the MIB universe and laugh-out-loud comedic lines from part 1.Everything, and I mean everything was overkill. Similar to the enormously overused Scrat in the sequel Ice Age: The Meltdown, Frank the Pug, one of the best characters created in MIB 1, is not only in 40% of the movie, they overstayed his welcome to the point of severe annoyance. (Who Let the Dogs Out? was old way before this movie came into existence and was too obvious anyways.) In addition, Kay (Jones) spewing off codes and Jay (Smith) going to mush every time Jay overshadows him was just getting stale.And the worst part (if you don't count Johnny Knoxville selling out, in addition to the worst and most unfunny CGI character since Jar Jar) was that one of the best aspects of MIB 1 was Jones's straight man character, Jay. Here, they have to cover up for MIB 1's mistake in that closing. He went into retirement and they spend exactly half the movie getting him to reverse this error in the plot. Thank God, they didn't give Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) amnesia in the Lethal Weapon 1 finale and then spend half of the wonderful Lethal Weapon 2 trying to not only get his character back on track but satisfy what they audience came to see.In this abomination sequel, aside from the aforementioned bringing Jay back into the line of duty, we have lonely and depressed Kay going through partners like Elizabeth Taylor. Once back with Jay, they battle another alien (in the form of the gorgeous, but practically useless in her role, Boyle) who, again, wants a small object that will again destroy the Earth in the matter of an hour. Again.You'll see characters from part one, like Torn's Zed flip in the air because, well, they think it would be funny for someone 108 years old kickboxing. You'll see Frank the Pug sing and whine and sing and whinerepeatedly. You'll see terrible and unfunny cameos from (the now late) Michael Jackson and Martha Stewart – which would've been funny, if the joke wasn't already used just about enough in the first movie. You see a grosser Knoxville than his persona from Jackass, but that's just because his 2-headed CGI character was horribly juvenile – more so than the MTV show. One of him is just enough. And you'll see everything you loved about the original being flushed away. (Literally.) And what's the deal with the original and wonderful Linda Fiorentino not returning? Obviously Jones and Smith were getting a boatload to sell out. It must have played out like this when she read the script: Fiorentino probably smiled and said, 'You've got to be kidding me. At least I have standards.' SKIP! Let's hope MIIIB is better; they've certainly had enough time to prepare. Jones is NOT getting any younger and he can't start using the Lethal Weapon line 'I'm getting too old for this sh*t' as we already know that.",2,2,3,6 February 2010
Hidden Figures," Hidden Gem or: Another Brilliant Mind
","I completely concur with Leslie Jones on the January 21, 2017 News Update on Saturday Night Live: Why the hell isn't this taught in schools?This movie is absolutely brilliant and I'm not just talking about a story concerning geniuses. It more than successfully took on Women's Right Issues, Segregation and sad computer advancement without harping, demeaning or overstaying its welcome on either subcategory while simultaneously honoring all the people involved. Most racial-devoted movies about the 60s take on one issue. Again, this knew it existed, spoke about it, battled against it and still moved the overall story to where it needed to be. It felt genuine and real. Plus, you couldn't help but feel the strain on these characters for the other tremendous odds stacked against them.Getting that out of the way – the story and well-written script, which happens to be my favorite aspect of any film, the cast is incredible. The three leads, Taraji P. Henson, Janelle Monáe and Octavia Spencer were amazing. This is not discounting the incredible performance from the fourth main character played by Kevin Costner, but these three awesome ladies deserve awards individually. Taraji P. Henson is the main lead, so I can see her nominated and would wish her a win. The problem is the two other actors, Spencer and Monáe. Both equally good and both deserve the supporting actress Academy Award.The movie worked for me. It absolutely had 'Oscar' moments, some I teared up in, some the waterworks couldn't be held back. So, if they were trying to 'over-dramatize' actual events to tug at our hearts, well, it worked on me.The story involves some prodigies who work for NASA in the space race with Russia and their struggles to (as stated above) to prove themselves in a duel-water fountain, back of the bus, women can't be (fill in the blank) world. It was never easy and mercifully there are opposite people, as shown here, that either cannot tolerate separation or change once shown the light. It's just the right thing to do; the right action to take!So sad this movie took place almost 60 years ago and we're still dealing with the same issues. Russia's huge involvement in America, women's equality and, of course, racism. There's a tense scene in the beginning that involves a white cop coming across our three black leads. It did have me on edge and made me incredibly depressed that while they had to do their best to not have the cop beat or arrest (or worse) them back then, this kind of tension still exists today.I applaud this movie. It needed to be made and now shown in schools. Taught, if nothing else. Since we're criminally still a divided country, more education and achievements need to be educated to our youths. Check out Leslie Jones' absolutely hilarious movie 'review' of this on the January 21, 2017 Saturday Night Live episode. While she was funny as heck, she is so right. THIS NEEDS TO BE OUT THERE. More need to see it. And it shouldno NEEDS to win awards so more are aware.And beyond my soapboxit was still one helluva movie! Go see it!!***Final thoughts: Yes, I am aware of the #oscarsowhite campaign last year: 2015. I was, sadly, indifferent until I saw the movie that sparked it all. While Concussion wasn't a great movie, it was still pretty good and had Will Smith's most outstanding performance of his career. I was totally onboard then for the movement. And I know of this phobia the voters have firsthand. As 'Liberal' as everyone makes Hollywood out to be, it still can be backwards. In my case, it's homophobia. They're batshit against gay cinema and, not that I wish anyone to pass on, but I cannot wait for the up and coming next generation to wipe out both homophobia and the obvious racial discrimination of this dying group. That all said, I really loved both Hidden Figures and Moonlight. I am not pushing them towards the top of my 2016 best list just to squash the #oscarsowhite controversy. They're solid movies on their own. I do, however, hope they are soon to become more mainstream because the two movie's messages need to be heard.",10,3,11,22 January 2017
Coco," Midnight in the Garden of Coco and Evil
","Probably the only thing preventing this from five stars status is overindulgence. C'mon guys, less is mostly always more.Coco is absolutely one of the best Pixar movies to date. It's so incredibly creative, inventive and still rooted in all history. It's completely black and white and that's what life really is. Not to mention Death, as well.When this movie began, I thought pleasant thoughts despite the normal story-telling and obvious outcomes & twists. But something told me: this was going somewhere I didn't predict and I was gonna love it. That spirit animal that led me was right.It's hard to describe all of Coco without spoilers or things best left explored by new viewers. But, suffice to say, it's about a musical soul who is held back by family and must reveal the truth, come hell or living activities. I love family and the bonds, but damn it, do NOT hold someone back from their dreams because of your own pasts. If you do, you're just as evil as the evil you're trying to conceal.Additionally, while family is important, dreams matter. Remember that.Coco is an ingenious and courageous film with a TON of heart. It doesn't solve the world's problems or show people need to be as creative as their souls want them to be, but it will blend the worlds and still show forgiveness is key to expanding your universe. ***Final thoughts: This is my friend's favorite Pixar movie. I agree that it's FANTASTIC and I loved almost every minute. No buts here. It's incredibly awesome and KRRRRR!",8,0,1,24 September 2018
Lincoln," Wait. They Forgot the Vampires!
","How is it that Daniel Day-Lewis isn't one of my favorite actors?He was brilliant in There Will Be Blood. He elevated that movie from a very good movie to a great one. He did the same for Lincoln.If you don't believe him as the 16th President or as someone who cared more about everyone being equal or as someone who wanted the bloodshed over during the Civil War, then, I'm sorry, you're blind.The movie, Lincoln, is not only Director Steven Spielberg's return to greatness, it's a very sad statement that after over 150 years, very little has changed. Of course, aside from the Republican/Democrat political change-over, it's the same back then as it is today. Heated debates, strong views and uncompromising votes still plague us today as it did back then. Mercifully, we had pure-at-heart Lincoln to do all he can for the better of all mankind.Yes, the movie is slow. Sure, it's riddled with heavy dialogue most of us, including myself, couldn't understand. And it contains just as many characters I could possibly keep up with (or learn about) as about three times the number of Dwarfs in The Hobbit. It didn't matter, to me. The movie was so elegantly made, so beautifully shot, I was enthralled so much I trusted everything they presented to me as truth of what really happened back then.As long as Lincoln was alive, all that he did, learned and accomplished was not highlighted here in this film. The movie focuses on Abe's plight to ensure the 13th amendment gets passed so that both the Civil War ceases and that all slaves are set free.I absolutely loved his intelligence, his compassion and his drive to ensure his vision of where we should be gets accomplished. He knew the game, the political one. He knew how to play everyone like chess pieces, but that didn't mean it would come out right. He took chances, sweated long and hard and without showing it, I know he prayed as hard as he could to make sure the just way prevails.You cannot help but look up to this man. It's sad to say, but he was so ahead of his time, his views still aren't completely felt today. Maybemake that, hopefullysomeday soon, all humans will be treated equally. I pray to God that happens in my lifetime.If I can get all this out of a movie, I know it was done right. It was acted and presented to me in the best possible manner. Though it's not my favorite movie of all time, or even, in 2012, it's still a great movie and if it does end up winning the Best Picture Oscar, I can certainly understand and not be disappointed.Now, if Mr. Day-Lewis loses the Best Actor Oscarthen there will be blood, indeed.",8,1,4,6 January 2013
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," At Least It Didn't Revolve Around Yet Another Death Star. Sorta
","Hey. Just two episodes ago was the return and now this is the last? Well, that was short lived.Thank the Maker for the last third of this movie because without it, this would've been the worst of all Star Wars films. Literally 30-40 minutes could've been easily cut to make the pacing, adventure, story and entertainment flow better. And the editing shouldn't have been reserved for just the first two thirds - there are more than several endings that they just couldn't let go. Despite having a tremendous death count (how many died? 100,000? 150,000?) I will say the movie was enormously hilarious. Not something you'd expect from a Star Wars film, even when there has been comedy bits throughout. Like Spider-Man Homecoming and Iron Man Three, this actually was a helluva lot more comedy than the movie I actually paid a ticket to see.Not really complaining, because I sure did laugh a lot, but when I go see a Spider-Man, Iron Man or Star Wars movie, I expect to see those movies and not a laugh-out-loud riot.I digress. Even at 152 incredibly long minutes, very little happens here. The movie is basically broken into two main events: a slow-ass escape scene and a dick teacher being chased after by an angry wannabe student. Sure, there are other subplots that mostly dissolve and really have no reason to be here other than to pad the already enormous runtime.It's the climax, or last third of this movie that truly saves this episode. Admittedly, the opening battle is cool, though, Episode III's is much better. But, the ending: WOW. Worth the price and almost a recommendation to show up an hour and 45 or so minutes late.I'm not unhappy I saw it, and it definitely begs rewatching as so many questionable scenes/actions needs more explaining. And again, that finale saved this and added a few extra stars for a recommendation.***Final thoughts: Here's the newest order of best to worst Star Wars films:1.

Brave," Bearly Brave
","Perhaps one of the shallowest, barley forgiving, selfish and hardly living up to the title character: Merida proves that Pixar was too desperate to finally introduce a female lead to its lineup. They should've waited until the right story came along.Brave, thankfully, has a much stronger second half, because the first part's old school Little Mermaid'ish plot was really annoying and thoroughly un-clever. And I'll give it kudos for introducing, or transforming, one character half way through that brightened the story and humor.Part-time archer, and I say part-time because they just had to throw in a completely incidental talent in the mix because, I dunno, bows and arrows are the hot thing these days, Princess Merida refuses to marry because she, sigh, wants to be a free spirit and sling arrows. Occasionally, that is.When given the opportunity, she makes a deal with a witch and inadvertently turns her mom into a bear. Desperately, she attempts to turn momma bear back into human form, and sadly, continues to blame the witch for another 45 minutes or so.(SPOILER ALERT – just this paragraph: When she finally, FINALLY, realizes it was her doing, the 'I'm sorry' speech is so lame and without heart, I still hated her just as much as before her insincere apology.)I will give grand points to the movie for the absolute beautiful landscaping and design. The movie looked gorgeous, from frame one to the close, it sparkled and amazed me. In addition, the score and songs were decent. Also, some scenes did make me laugh out loud, such as the three little rascal brothers of the Princess helping her escape – having to be bribed, no less, since this movie has little morals – by mimicking a shadow of a bear in the castle's light. Further, the momma bear did provide some comic relief, though she was terribly unoriginal.But, the blah, dated and predictable (even to kids) story really will keep me from ever watching this again. Sad. I wanted to give Pixar another chance after the abysmal Cars 2. And with the upcoming and dreaded Monsters Inc. prequel, I think I'll just patiently wait for the third Kung Fu Panda movie to renew my faith in computer animated films.Side Note: Nudity? Really? I understand these films are also engineered to appease adults as well as kids, but nudity, even the cartoon kind, has no business in these films. Shame.",5,0,4,25 December 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," It Might Make its Money Back
","If only the Star Wars prequels were even a tenth of how good this kinda, sorta, updated Star Wars flick.I was way off on my prediction for this Guardians of the Galaxy film. I thought with the stream of Sci-Fi wannabes from sometimes acclaimed novels and a relatively unknown live cast, this was going to bomb and bomb hard. Unfortunately for me and fortunately for the movie, I couldn't have been more off. (In my defense and demise, I predicted this 6 months prior to opening. Sheesh! That's way too early to predict any box office number.)I didn't think the movie would necessarily suck, or would be barely watchable, but I'm just not into Sci-Fi and because of which, it took me 30 days to the day of release to finally see this. Poor choice #2 on my part. (Almost 4 months for The Matrix – and I wish I had seen that one sooner, as well.) While not perfect, way too many predictable lines and twists and slightly longer than it needed to be, the movie worked extremely well overall. Though the highlights were the literal laugh-out-loud humor, killer soundtrack and very good and inventive effects, the best aspect for me were the fantastic and memorable characters.How they worked on their own, their depth and the comradery between them was simply divine. Too often characters, and especially ego- driven actors portraying them, ruin what could be a fun adventure flick with depth. Everyone's chemistry was spot-on and I couldn't help but love everyone individually and definitely together. Heck, even The Avengers dragged too long on the conflicts within. What was also nice about the bond of our heroes was the reasons of being together. Not a single weak part to everyone's story line – everything worked splendidly as a whole. To have this many characters – five main and exclusive characters – all feeding off each other while maintaining their own direction isn't easy and should be praised when it does occur.I went into this movie with ZERO expectations. I neither really wanted to see it nor did I think it would be bad. What I got was one pleasant surprise after another. For example, the opening nearly had me in tears – and not from laughter.The movie opens with our future hero and 'Han Solo's nephew,' Peter 'Star Lord' Quill's mother passing and that's immediately followed by his space abduction and eventually 20+ years later. Now, a full blown Han Solo renegade, he's trying to steal a sphere, Raiders of the Lost-like and the adventure begins with him being chased, him meeting the rest of the title characters and the rise of heroism.To be honest, the story is not the newest or freshest out there, but it works beautifully here. Even the negative of occasionally predictable scenes, as mentioned above, was necessary for a movie like this to have. It's enormously unique on its own, but needed to tone it back to be more accessible to the general audiences while giving homage to the greats like this before it.The emotional scenes also worked, as in the beginning – that was tough! not to get upset then – and a couple more later. Also, the laughs were plentiful even with the ones absolutely not geared towards me. I appreciated that they spread out the humor so not to just please one audience type. Further, the sometimes ingenious ways of solving problems were fantastic as was the loyalty amongst our crew – something I love to see in movies like this. Yes, I know it's more realistic to show more conflict than they did here, but I'm certainly not going into a movie like this and trying to find too much realism. And finally, I am HOOKED, as most people are on that dang good soundtrack. I look forward to more follow-ups and cross-over's. I am super glad my prediction didn't come true and happy for a genuine blockbuster in one of the most lackluster box-office summers in many, MANY years. * * *Final thoughts: I might need to watch it again – ha, I'm definitely buying this on Blu when it arrives, and I might be wrong, but far too many people survived way too long in space and exposed. I kept saying 'NO' out loud as if I were Grumpy Cat when I saw one fly through space with only a secured helmet on. His hair was flowing with the transition and his hands were ungloved, even. Again, I might be mistaken, but this and a few other minor anti-physic-issues I couldn't get past.Did this downgrade the movie in any way? Another 'NO.' As much as I didn't like to see such obvious mistakes, it's still a space- adventure-comedy. Heck, even the very-fun Gravity had its share of issues, and that was supposed to be realistic.",8,0,5,31 August 2014
Evil Dead," Camp and Campbelless
","and frightless, as well.Evil Dead (2013,) the second remake of the 1981 original did have its moments and it sure as hell was creepy and bloody, but did it hold up to the original? No. Did it even come close to the lesser, though still very good Army of Darkness? Nope. But, at least it trumped the first remake, Evil Dead II.It might be best to start over and not compare it to the source material(s), and let it stand on its own. Of course, even then, it was just the run-of-the-mill horror fare as of late running amok with clichés, the stereotypical young and dumb adults proving their idiocracy with every single turn and contained more gore than frights – a sign of incompetent writing in regards to horror.Of course, what's scary is subjective, but I found nothing terrifying. Just a handful of bloody and gross shots and completely unrealistic endurances and actions from the living.If this movie wasn't so bent on being serious – yeah, going back to the source material for a moment – and shedding its established campiness from the first three installments, I would've given it a pass. But, since it does provide us with rules for the evil spirits and 'normal ones' for the still breathing, I had the hardest time suspending any disbelief from what these buffoons could physically do to themselves and not just survive, but thrive. And those plot holes and inconsistenciesthose were a pain to ignore as well.Following an actually decent opening scene, where veteran Evil Dead fans knew how it would play out, five young adults venture to the absolute creepiest cabin this side of Jason Voorhees's shack in Friday the 13th Part 2. Naturally, no one questions this, and decide this is the best place to detox one of the fivesome.Pausing a minute for character depth and who's whoOh, wait, they never did, so I don't have anything to report other than one female is another male's girlfriend and the druggie was that male's sister. Whew, by saving time to never completely introduce the main stars or establishing eventual empathy for them, it gives the writers time to get to the only reason to make this movie: gore.Anyhoo, one of our 'heroes,' a blatant (albeit terrible copy) 'Marty Mikalski' rip off character from The Cabin in the Woods and Eric Stoltz-look alike actually named, ah-hem, Eric in the movie, reads from a book found in the cellar and our strung out female gets the Evil Dead bug. How she did, which was homage to the original The Evil Dead, was far less inventive, although it did cause a couple to get up and leave my movie theater.Stopping therethe title alone should NOT fool anyone. They weren't trying to be comical, though deceiving, by naming it: A Family Fun Cabin in the Woods. What would someone possibly expect by buying a ticket to: EVIL DEAD and then getting offended by gore?At any rate, you know the story, even if you hadn't seen any of the four (so far) Evil Dead films: she gets possessed, confusion ensues and death becomes them.Admittedly, some of the later scenes in the movie, when the heat finally picks up, were effective and gross; even I had to turn away once. But, if you added up every scene that I thought was successful to a film in this genre, you could fit those in the final third of the trailer and save us all some time. And the lack of more original ideas pales in comparison to something (or one) else the film omitted.Sadly, Bruce Campbell was not in this. Reasons of, to the date and time of this writing, are unknown to me on why not. Perhaps, again, they wanted to shift away from the camp, or he was too busy on another project or, maybe, he read the script co-written from the gal who brought usJennifer's Body. I doubt he would've been able to save this movie, but at least he would've been the highlight.Final thoughts: I didn't hate this movie, nor really disliked it. Blah, yeah. Despite it being a remake, unoriginal, uh-huh. Would I want to see it again? Nope. Buteven though I would recommend any Evil Dead newbie to watch just Part 1 (1981) and Part 3 (Army of Darkness), you could do worse than this mindless splatterfest.",3,54,108,7 April 2013
The Evil Dead," The Original Book of the Living Dead
","If not for The Evil Dead (1981), The Cabin in the Woods wouldn't have a spot on the GPS. Or, dozens of other movies, for that matter.I understand this is a cult hit, for many, many years. While I never was a huge fan –in fact, it took me a LONG while to finally see this (my first viewing was probably in the late 1990s,) I still appreciated its upbringing. Seeing it today, in 2013, I think I appreciate it even more.The movie is pure craziness. It contains no sense of realism, the characters act like they know they're in a B-Movie and the 'joke's on them.' And the special effects, while fantastic for the budget they had, didn't always hold up today. Lightning from Plan 9 from Outer Space-type movies, anyone?We have three girls and two boys headed towards a secluded cabin in deep woods when all hell breaks loose following a playing of a tape-recording of words from the Book of the Dead. From those words spoken, or replayed, craziness ensures, such as possession, Exorcistrees and, ah-hem, a wooden rape scene. Man, the dead play back.Despite the maximum level of insane carnage, there is so much to appreciate here, from both an independent film lover and all horror connoisseurs. The cinematography was actually very well done – you can tell this young film maker/unknown at the time: Sam Raimi, had a future. The special effects and gore, in spite of the low budget, was beyond what it could've been. Like Raimi, you can tell these people knew what they were doing, even with the dollars they had to spend. And the cast gave it their all, with what they were given and the direction from a newbie, albeit someone who knew what he was doing.That all said, in regards to the cast, unfortunately, as good as Bruce Campbell was, he will eventually, following this, of course, have even better charisma and show much more of his eventual talent. He just wasn't as developed here, as I would've liked to see of him.And, the movie isn't perfect, and some of the scenes, ideas don't add up, such as a small Doctor Who'ish cabin that seems to have more rooms than the White House. But, if you just let yourself go, and remind yourself of the timeframe and budget, you can have a good time. And best of all, (SPOILER – sorry, but it has been 32 years, for the love of the dead) it was refreshing to have a male hero at the end of a horror tale. As much as I loved Halloween, or the numerous horror franchise films to follow, such as A Nightmare on Elm Street, the heroine is always the take-down-the-villain character. For once, it's nice to have it be a male.At any rate, it is recommended for horror and low-budget 1980s fare fans out there.Side Note: I have listened to very few audio commentaries in my lifetime, to my dismay. But, one of the all-time favorites of mine, and most hilarious, was one of the 150 DVDs re-releases of The Evil Dead and it was a solo-Bruce Campbell commentary. I cannot state which DVD it is on, but I was laughing so hard with his words on it. It was one of those: Press play on the commentary, and if it picks up, continue. Well, it did 'pick up' on minute 5 and Bruce never let up. He was absolutely uproarious. Not to miss his, if given the chance.",7,0,2,4 April 2013
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," You and I have some unfinished business
","There are so many things right about Kill Bill Vol. 1, but let me focus on one of the best aspects: Tarantino makes you so enthralled, you want more. So much more.One of my biggest complaints about movies is the length and not knowing when to shut up. (Rarely, will I say the opposite, though Children of Men needed to be so much longer, or a series.) Heck, I've even complained about other Tarantino movies being too long. (Inglourious Basterds) But, Vol. 1 is just perfect in pacing and longing. He masterfully made us wanting more, or, Vol. 2. And I'm not just talking about the absolute spoiler in the final few seconds. The whole thing seems quick enough with barely a down minute and gives enough background to know there is so much more to this story line.Plot line: 'The Bride' is immediately 'assassinated' in the opening and immediately reveals her unborn baby is the ultimate killer, Bill's. Then the movie moves fast-forward, reverse and in-between, much like Tarantino's other work, i.e. Pulp Fiction. It's not easy for the average movie-goer, but I felt he made it a lot smoother, and easier to follow this time around.Tarantino gives enough background on what led her to the El Paso church where she ultimately 'died' and why she eventually wakes from a four-year coma to seek revenge on the five responsible for her and her unborn child's attempted murder.In Vol. 1, you get to see her vengeance on Green (Fox) in front of Green's daughter – spoiler alert, this is supposedly the setup for a Vol. 3 in years to come, and Ishii (Liu.) In between, she kicks some ass on bystanders and loyal gang members.This movie is Tarantino at his best. The best he wants to be: a Grind-House voyeur. An excellent story-teller. You can't take this movie seriously. It's silly in a lot of ways, but that's the Grind-House in Tarantino. And this leads me to another fantastic quality of Vol. 1: Thurman.Despite the foretold silliness, Thurman as 'The Bride' does an excellent job, and in my opinion, at least an Oscar-Nominated acting job. She brought extreme realism to an otherwise campy character out for revenge. And, you wanna know another perfect quality about her? Tarantino makes you root for her despite her being a ruthless assassin. A real bad-ass-gal.I don't want to give away too much about the plot, subplots or scenes in the movie, but almost everything works in this movie: Music, score, style, acting, originality, suspense, action, cinematography, dialogue and uses of both color, B&W and anime. This is Tarantino at the top of his game.To expand: I loved this movie. The action was tight; the movie was extremely well paced. The music, both score and soundtrack was wonderful. The choreographed scenes were fun to watch. The twists exciting. The dialogue and writing was pitch-perfect. I would say this was his best work, if not for his even better earlier works (Jackie Brown, Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs) or movie to come: Vol. 2.Just remember the origins of this movie: it's basically an explicit Japanese exploitation martial arts/revenge movie and you can get past the silliness, the plot-holes, such as how she always seemed to have money and no one ever investigated her murders, i.e. Buck during her multi-hour recover scene (speaking of which, why were her upper muscles so accessible while down-below were so, well, weak?) Word of advice: don't look too deep, enjoy the master Tarantino and sit back, have fun and look forward to the (so-far) conclusion in Vol. 2.",9,1,3,26 November 2009
Saw II," The Return of the Haunted House
","Let the games continue. 'Saw II' had one great thing going for it: it brought back a true 'haunted house.' Since I don't believe in ghosts, let me explain – the worn-down house in 'Saw II' that the multiple victims need to navigate through is truly a 'haunted' house, in my opinion. They seemed to want to up the ante from 2 victims in the first movie to 3-4 times that and have them all solve another puzzle by Jigsaw simultaneously creating a Hannibal/Clarice scene between the now practically on his deathbed, Jigsaw, and the father of one of the test subjects. That's probably a better term than 'victims,' as anyone who's seen the 'Saw' series, knows there's always a reason the people are there, and if they're victims, they really only did it to themselves. This is their wake-up call. Do I agree to the extreme measures Jigsaw puts these people through? Not at all. But, I didn't create the (now) long-running series. Previously mentioned, I said they up'd the ante, and they did with gore but more importantly, plot twists. Where part 1 almost started up too many twists/turns, this one is practically tripping over themselves to introduce multiple story lines (obviously setting up the inevitable III, IV+) but that's part of its downfall. While it's fun to try and solve the mystery/whodunit, it's almost exhausting to keep up with everything flashed in front of you in music-video-style. That said, I did enjoy the movie, loved some of the revolutions and it was nice to see more of Jigsaw interact, almost to the point of feeling sorry for him and wondering if he's the smartest person in the room. Perhaps he is, but putting ourselves in the opposite character's shoes, it would probably be hard for us to act differently.",7,0,1,26 September 2009
From Dusk Till Dawn," The Original Grindhouse Double Feature
","Remember when vampires were scary? Remember when they portrayed as the beasts they really are?Though I hate the Twilight series, despite the laughs it gives me, I admit, I love the TV series: True Blood, with its romantic and adventurous with a bit of humor take on the vampire lore.That said, it's refreshing to watch how vampires are supposed to be shown. And that's only half the battle! There's two complete movies in here (three, if you count the excellent documentary: Full Tilt Boogie based on the making of From Dusk Till Dawn) and both are wonderful to watch. You have the heavy Tarantino-laced opening half about two despicable bank robber brothers Seth (Clooney) and Richard (Tarantino) who literally destroy lives in the path to Mexico and the second half – a completely different movie using the same characters who now find themselves deep within a Vampire Haven at the Titty Twister bar.It helps I love both Clooney and Tarantino, but I'm also very fond of the multitude of other actors: Michael Parks, Tom Savini, John Saxon, Hayek, Marin, Trejo and Keitel. And everyone was on their game throughout. In addition, the music and score rocked, the dialogue was absolutely spot-on and the tongue-in-cheek & no scene taking itself serious were awesome. If you like Tarantino's other films, or Clooney – you really have to like him, you will love this excellent film. Even Lewis, whom I've despised since Cape Fear didn't ruin my fun.I've now seen this at least a dozen times, each time I thoroughly enjoy it more. Director Rodriguez seemingly did the impossible and made it work 100%: he not only put way too much in the movie, he also turned these two ruthless murderers into characters you (gasp) rooted for. Generally, I don't like the overcrowding of films, but Screenplay Writer Tarantino made it seem just like a very long and event-packed day.(Very) Basic rundown: Seth escapes prison (well, courthouse) with the help of his brother and (severe) sex-offender, Richard, and the plow through many innocents to get money from a bank and attempt to get across the border. (Side Note: Even with the hilarious Marin playing his first of three characters, the border patrol agent, this scene would probably be impossible to take seriously in today's time.)One method to get into Mexico and hide out, is to kidnap a 'Lost Faith' Minister (Keitel) and his two children who are riding in their new mobile home. (The dialogue between Keitel and Clooney from the moment they meet to the end is reminiscent of Ocean's Eleven's Clooney and Pitt's banter. In other words: a whole lotta fun.)They do make south of the border and to a strip club/dive, the Titty Twister, and dominate Seth commands respect while making the kidnapped family drink and converse with him. Okay, he does get the respect he desires until, well, uh, practically everyone turns into a vampire and it's up to a select few to combat and survive from Dusk till Dawn.It's a fun experience, especially if you're into Tarantino films – there was a lot of Reservoir Dogs here, after all. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.Everybody be cool. You be cool.",9,0,0,3 October 2010
Here Comes the Boom," Rocky Redux
","Admittedly, I fell for it. I actually had a great time during Here Comes the Boom. And all the way to the predictable sports ending.This movie screams the stereotypical 'Based on/Inspired by/Is a' true sports underdog story, but I looked it up. Yes! I did research. It's not. Sorry, spoiler.But, I didn't look that up until after the movie was over. And that's too bad, because all the way through this, I was finding this very cliché, predictable and has an enormously weak premise if this happened in real life.That all said, it's still a very cliché, predictable and has an enormously weak premise and even thenI had a good time. The humor made me laugh out loud at moments, the heart was there and best of all, Kevin James ran around without a shirt on for a good sixth of the movie. Bonus!, but I understand irrelevant.Terrible teacher, Scott (James,) with a minute, though growing, amount of a heart takes on the self-imposed task of raising $48,000 to save both his peer and music teacher's job and the entire school's music department. After a series of failed money attempts, Scott meets the right folks to align him with the cash from mixed-martial art fighting. Will Scott raise enough? Will he die trying since this is MMA and he's an overweight, out-of-shape, inexperienced, late-forties dude? Will he get the girl?Seriously? I don't like spoiling major plot points, and I won't start here since you can draw your own conclusions. And yet AND YETI still had a great time. I went along for the ride and in rare form for me and my reviews, I ditched the critic side. Perhaps it was because the characters had charisma, or because the comedy did make me laugh, or the energy from the cast and their respective fictional characters had me pumped. Maybe it was the Vegas shots I wasn't expecting. I dunno. I just had fun.And that inevitable finale, with the funny homage to the movie this might be slightly imitating, had me sitting up and cheering. I even loved so much the following line by the Henry Winkler character I grew to love:'You've already done it. To hell with my job. Look up there, look at those kidsLet me tell you what you would see. You would see a bunch of our students witnessing complete resolve in the face of an unbearable obstacle. They are invested. Scott, they're inspired. That's what we're supposed to do as teachers, right? Inspire. You can quit right now and everything that we've worked will have been accomplished. You know, last night, Molie said to me on the phone that you thought I was your hero. You're mine.' – Marty.I know this movie, on the surface, may appear like cheese. And it's certainly one I would normally chew up and spit outBut, on a rare occasion, they got to me and they won. I had fun and would recommend this movie.",8,1,2,27 April 2013
Clash of the Titans," Release the Original!
","Regardless that it's been nearly 30 years since I saw the original, a fantasy that awed, inspired and excited me as a child, I had to see the updated Clash of the Titans. And this is despite the fact this is NOT my type of movie. (In fact, I have virtually no plans in seeing the forthcoming Prince of Persia film, though I played the original video game, again, as a child.) Fine, the original used clay. To a child that was close to cartoons, and that was okay – especially since it was on a grand scale with giant monsters. Kewl! Obviously with the update, they would switch to the (newly) time-honored CGI (or Copout Graphics for the Indolent.) I was hardly impressed with the special effects. Sure, they were well made, but original? No. Exciting? Eh. In fact, I felt for the most part of the movie, I just wanted it to be over, even though the script promised a climatic (RELEASE THE KRAKEN!) demon of sort. By the time the sea monster appeared (another unoriginal creation) I was anxious to take off.Now, that doesn't make it a complete waste. It was worth a viewing (and I saw it in 2-D, I've heard to stay away from the 3-D for good reason.) But it was absolutely not worth a second viewing. Even on DVD.Demigod Perseus (Worthington) must go on a journey, get dozens killed and defeat the Kraken while proving to Uncle Hades and his father, Zeus, he's a man. (Get used to that last part, he'll protest, though cheat multiple times, that he has to complete his journey and fight like a man a few dozen times.) Meanwhile, the most downright wimpiest and ridiculous gods (played so softly by two very talented actors, Neeson and Fiennes) are plotting/working together(?) to stop Perseus.Though I am not 100% educated on the mythological gods, I thought they were supposed to somewhat or fully omnipotent. If so, they're doing a terrible job at stopping this half-mortal. This proves my lack of interest in this genre. Much like Lord of the Rings, if someone has great power, I want to see them use it! These 'gods' actually seem content to just sit around and 'hope for the best.' Basically, it's a point A to point B adventure that rarely steps above anything, EVERYTHING that has come before it. Again, it's not horrible, but never reaches even 'average' status. Recommended for die-hard fans only of the genre.",3,1,2,16 April 2010
Jurassic World," Come to see Dinos fight, but not the World
","Basically, everything you'd want to see in a Jurassic sequel, or correcting all they got wrong with parts 2-3, is here. That's really it, but not to downplay it, those scenes were EXECELLENT, specifically the special effects and dinosaur attacks. Not to give any away, but the climatic final battle is one of the best I've seen. And even though everything in that third act is as predictable as a Nicholas Sparks movie (actually, everything here is,) I definitely wanted all that to happen. Additionally, the throwback scene to the original, including the accompanying score, was pretty darn cool. And finally, while I've been a fan of Chris Pratt since Parks & Rec, I was so pleased he stepped out of his smart aleck, goofy roll he's played in practically everything and played a pretty good character. As much as I like him, I was originally dreading him not acting outside the box in this, much like 90% of Melissa McCarthy's career. Luckily he proved himself – now bring on (or back?) Indy!That all said, Jurassic World was far from perfect – even though it beat the hell out of The Lost World and the horrendous Part III. The movie dragged a lot with uninteresting subplots – oh, no divorce again!, a dick of a kid (the older brother) I wanted to punch in the throat and a wasted opportunity, especially with the title, on just rehashing the same old formula with incredibly bad decisions made on an island. Literally nothing is new here. And that's sad, especially since this will make a lot and lo, we'll be back on another island for the inevitable part V. Overall, the good way outweighed the bad, and is highly recommended for fans of the first one. The special effects, dino-scenes, BIRDS ATTACK! and the end battle were worth it alone.",6,0,4,14 June 2015
Paranormal Activity," PN = PU, or the comedy event of 2009!
","I will admit I had a string of emotions for Paranormal Activity.First, and foremost, it was a deep laughter. I couldn't stop laughing. I kept thinking they got the title wrong because you wait sooo long for any activity to happen in Paranormal Activity. Then, I was simply bored and began to fall asleep; so I guess that was a mixture of boredom and exhaustion. Finally, I was upset that, even at its extremely minimal length (and action) that I even bothered to waste about an hour and a half of my life watching a poorly made 5-minute YouTube video stretched way too long. We'll call that one frustration. (Another emotion I simply made up, and thoroughly annoyed my roommate, was whenever something bumped or ohhhh moved on its own (like those scary keys or that door!) I shouted out a fake scream, or the old 'OHHHH' like the ghosts in cartoon past.) I guess if one is scaaared of what bumps in the night is a demon that follows you around, then maybe, MAYBE you might be frightened. But really, watch The Exorcist for more depth, horror and suspense.I'd like to go back to my initial reaction. I seriously laughed my ass off. I am so glad I didn't see this at one of those midnight showings. I'm sure they would have kicked me out.In addition to the numerous 'MICAH!' shouted out every few minutes – finally someone topped the number of times 'JACK!' and 'ROSE!' was screamed in Titanic, there were an abundant of funny lines spoken. My personal favorite was: 'Maybe we shouldn't have the camera.' I shouted 'YES! I agree! I'd rather watch the old snow on TV like in the much better Poltergeist!' We have this enormously dysfunctional couple who, just as partners, decide to move in with each other. I've been told prior to the viewing that he's mean to her, and she carries some demon with her from place to place. I agree with the second part, though I wish the demon would've got to her before the movie began. I don't agree with the first part of the synopsis. He is not mean to her; he reacted like any rational human would (as I would have.) In addition, she held back a huge part of her – this ooooh floor stomping demon, and he called her on it. Her defense was: she didn't want to tell him on their first date, so he asked why not up to the 30th date or when they decided to live together. That's right. She was wrong.I'm giving this movie too much air (screen) time. It's a very boring, very slow and very funny movie for someone with $50 and a camera. Virtually nothing happens, but this male-half decides to film anyways. For 86 agonizing minutes we hear and see something that could be part of any Junior High Haunted House kiddie fundraiser. If this was just that and my fifty cents went to help the kids go to college, I would still ask for my money back.The only thing I can say that's nice about this is that I applaud yet another fantastic ad-campaign, like Blair Witch's, I am happy they avoided trickery in making the audience believe this was real. Fool me once Don't see this movie. Don't see the inevitable sequel. As in the movie where a lot of the video shown was fast-forwarded, that's what you'll want to do as well.",1,7,11,11 January 2010
Mission: Impossible II," Difficult Mission, Different Crew and Better than I
","Man, I didn't care for the first Mission: Impossible movie, but that's another review. Where part one dealt strictly with the spy business and forgetting action almost all together, part II was the exact opposite. (SEE: Mission: Impossible III where they finally got it right.)Be prepared to be bombarded with SLO-MOOOOO scenes and roughly 50 fake-face/gotcha scenes. Okay, 50 is steep, but after the 8-9th time, it'll feel as much. Get past that and you have a decent action flick with a wonderful (so-called – at the time – retired) Anthony Hopkins cameo, the gorgeous Thandie Newton and sly Dougray Scott. Also the score was good and soundtrack was awesome with one of my favorites: Take a Look Around by Limp Bizkit.Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is on holiday (love that non-American way of stating: vacation) when he's called back to duty to get a virus which was produced so there can be a cure. SeriouslyI've seen this several times and never really followed why they needed to create a virus in order for them to have a need for a cure.Yeah, money, duh. But, the initial scientists were working on the right side. Anyways, Hunt has to recruit people for his mission: Nyah (Newton) and his signature buddy, Luther (the always fun Ving Rhames) and someone else that I don't even remember so it doesn't matter. There's double crossing, global hopping and again, slow-motion scenes withdoves (or was it pigeons) flapping around for 'style' I'm guessing.It's a no-brainer film with some big budgeted scenes. It's fun if you let yourself go and leave your brain at the door. The series won't be complete or worthwhile until the next installment.",5,0,3,10 April 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," Right & Left Paths Cross Under
","(Special Note: This is a delayed review from a movie I recently saw, albeit many months ago. Without notes, these are my recollections to the best of my ability. If you were to speak to me about this particular movie, I bet I could elaborate even more. Mercifully, for most of my review's general lengths, this is going to be short, sweet & to the pointCheers.)Oh, I wish I took notes during The Adjustment Bureau because I just didn't like it and can't remember exactly whyfor the most part. Sadly, I would have to rewatch this 106 minute movie to recall, but suffice to say, it wasn't all that good. I remember the idea was fine, but poorly executed, way too far-fetched and the 'bad guys' were so unintentionally comical in their hats and methods that it was hard to root for 'our hero' willing to give up everything for a chance encounter.

The Hangover Part II," Ocean's Twelve Part Two
","Okay, it might be unfair to compare The Hangover Part II to the part two of the George Clooney's Ocean's series. After all, I am one of the rarities that actually liked Ocean's Twelve and at least Danny's gang changed the plot for their second outing while this 'wolf-pack' literally modeled their sequel after the first movieline by line. Shot by shot.Okay, that all said, let's compare. Shall we?Both Ocean's Twelve and The Hangover Part II's source movies began in Las Vegas, NV, U.S.A while the sequels took place in another continent. Twelve and II had superior and hilarious origins and followed up by 'how did this happen again' premises. And (HOPEFULLY) the third segment of (the inevitable) The Hangover Part III will be the 'make-up' movie Ocean's Thirteen was, much like Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was to Temple of Doom. (Okay, that last part is jumping ahead a bit)I literally watched The Hangover Part II to laugh. I needed it, after a long, LONG, week of work & dentist (long story) stress. Unfortunately, minimal laughter came from me. Slightly from the reoccurring character 'Mr. Chow' (Ken Jeong) and mostly from 'Alan' (Zach Galifianakis.)I'll admit: it just wasn't that funny. I got quickly past the 'it's EXACTLY the same as part one – aside from the locale' part. That was obvious. I was at least hoping for something new or fresh, of which, I got neither. I did get a good, and different, look at Bangkokone that the tourist industry doesn't want you to see. And believe it or not, it did serve as a good, though mediocre 'mystery' while watching these blind fools retrace their stepsagain.Okay.so we have the same gang from the original (Phil, Stu, Alan, sometimes Doug and Mr. Chow at times) who travel to Thailand for Stu's wedding along with the clichéd, disapproving father. Eh, forget that last part, cuz it's so insignificant to the synopsis of the foolish group of men who misplaces the bride's brother, Teddy (Mason Lee) during a drunken night of mischief.Have you seen the superior, The Hangover? Stick with that. I did really like that original first movie. And unless you're a Die-hard fan of these characters that do, say and act the same in this inferior follow-up, EVERY STEP OF THE WAY, skip the sequel.I have a feeling, The Hangover Part III will be the apology both Last Crusade and Ocean's Thirteen were. For that, I'll give the third hangover a shot. But, for now, I've experienced more entertaining 'real' hangovers than this movie gave me",4,0,0,30 June 2011
Prisoners," Gone Girls
","Boy, was I wrong about this movie.I thought it was, in fact, about 'prisoners' in prison – maybe trying to escape and I put it off for the past 2½ years, although I did want to see it and others expressed high praise for it. I just thought it was some Shawshank Redemption film about the wrongfully accused. And I did keep thinking the dad was going to play that role in the first half to two-thirds. But, that couldn't be further from what this great movie was. It's an incredibly well-written, wonderfully acted, deep and moving thriller about two families struggling with the loss of their respective daughters. It's also a definite movie to see at bare minimum a second time.One wonderful (to start with) Thanksgiving, two neighboring families enjoy their meal together and in a blink, two of the family's daughters vanish. When one young male is accused of abducting the girls, one of the rightfully distraught fathers makes it his mission to find his the girls by making the man talk. All the while, a police detective is attempting to find them, too, but using the law and his instincts vs. the emotional father's antics. Probably the only downfall of this movie is that it's just too long. As much as I enjoyed the movie as a whole and all the interesting, sometimes shocking, sometimes very emotional scenes, it just kept going on and on. That said, I am SHOCKED this wasn't nominated for the many awards it deserved. The two leads themselves, Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal alone should've nabbed some competing acting nods, not to mention, best picture and screenplay.While it's easy to compare this to the following year's Gone Girl, they're pretty separate in stories, though close to the thrill of the chase and intrigue. This one was slightly better, and it didn't have Ben Affleck, to boot. So, if you missed this one, but loved Gone Girl, you really need to see this.Actually, just see it, no matter what. It helps if you have small children as you can sympathize, but even without kids, it's still an emotional roller coaster that's great all the way to the ending.***Final thoughts: I don't know why I stayed away so long. So many recommended it to me. It was my invalid vision of what the movie's plot was and hopefully I won't let that happen again. Definitely want to see this again fairly soon.",9,3,5,7 February 2016
Logan," Thank you. Now, Reboot!
","The moment everyone craved as arrived! No longer is there a wait for  the most simultaneously realistic, R-rated and miserable superhero film  of all time: Logan.  Seriously, they wanted a serious Wolverine movie. We got it. Just, as  always, be careful what you wish for.  It's hard to rate this movie low because of the production values,  acting and no-holds-barred R-rating. But, on the flipside, it's hard to  recommend this movie because it's so off-the-beaten-superhero path,  it's set 12 years into the future with about .0005% future proof and  worst of all: it's incredibly depressing.  Sadly, someone online spoiled two main points in  this movie, so I knew what to expect. What I didn't see coming, though,  was how sad this movie was. If you love superhero movies, hope and fun  X-Men unity, look elsewhere. This movie is the equivalent of sitting in  the hospice waiting room with your loved one a couple of doors down the  halland just patiently waiting.  BUT, I suppose everyone demanded it. Everyone wanted the Hard-R  Wolverine movie. So here it is. In all its surprising simplicity.  The supposedly invincible and ageless 'Old-Man' Logan is feeling he's  finally on his way out, but he reluctantly agrees to one more mission:  take a girl to the Promised Land. Along the way, the two people he  cares the most about are just as hunted as he is.  While I cannot deny this was a well-made film, I doubt I will be  watching this again. I usually don't wish for reboots of series, but I  do now. Here. This was a perfect final X-Men filmof the Fox Age. Give  it up, Fox!  Also, I'm not all about Disney having supreme rule over the Earthor at  least, Earth's (Real) Mightiest Heroesbut, now, hand this franchise  over to capable hands. Reboot it. Call it, The Uncanny X-Men. I don't  care. But, see this as a true end to that long string of foX-Men films.  And remember what it's like to have fun with superhero films. Heck,  even Man of Steel, Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad, combined,  wasn't 10% as bleak as this.  ***  Final thoughts: Admittedly, I fell asleep twice in this movie. I'm not  going to go as far as to say this movie is boring, but yeah, sometimes  it drags, is too heavy, dark, melancholy and was way too long for such  a simple plot. So, being boringisn't the only flaw.",5,4,11,17 April 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Waiting for Round 2 of Round 2
","Like the first Avengers, I liked it up front. With each of the following viewings, my 'liking' of it grew more and more into pure LOVE. I liked Part 2 after my first of inevitable multiple viewings to come. It was hilarious at times, darker, more adult and relished in taking a ton from both the original Avengers movies plus many things from the other MCU films. I wouldn't call it perfect, as I noticed a few too many questions I couldn't answer by the end. Also, some of the scenes were just rehashing both scenes and plot devices in its predecessor. I do believe, at least, the questions will be answered with my second (or more) viewings. And speaking of which, I don't think this is a ONE-TIME viewing movie. There is a TON of stuff here to absorb – an almost countless number of subplots, relationships, motives, backgrounds, flashbackscome to think about it, why they didn't break this movie into two, like they plan for Avengers 3a and 3b, it beyond me. Perhaps Whedon knew this was his last shot, so he just threw everything in. Whatever. I still liked what came out. I refuse to give specific details of the movie on what I liked or sucked or plot points or scenesas enough spoilers have been shot around the internet as it is. Probably once this has been around awhile and I've had 1 or 2 more viewings, I'll open up more. Until thenAssemble to your nearest theatre!",8,1,6,2 May 2015
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," East End Gurl
","I'm at a disadvantageI'm just not that into musicals. Especially the odd types – still haven't seen 'Moulin Rouge!'But, I appreciate my friends' recommendations. After the second – or is this the third or more? – recommendation to see 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch' (4/5 Stars) I finally gave in. I was so unfamiliar with what this was about, aside from the main character being a drag performer and it was a musical, I thought the title ended with: 'and the angry ITCH' and thought that made sense.I admitthis one is hard for me to review. It's certainly not mainstream. It's also not black & white. In fact, I hate reviewing movies like these because my mind's going around in circles. (This is certainly above my pay rangebut since I don't get paidthank God, right?)I did like the movie, very much. I loved the music, the songs, the story. The acting of director/writer/star John Cameron Mitchell, aka 'Hedwig' was phenomenal. The movie's wildly original and for the most part I could follow it. ButFine. I admit, I was a bit lost, especially in the absolute finale This MUST stem from my lack of interest in musicals because I guess I'm supposed to 'get' the finale and see where this incredibly interesting character headed when naked down an alleySo, I will be watching this again. It sincerely helps that I loved the music and (pretty tragic) story of a lost boy. And then, perhaps I can answer some questions of mine(Spoiler alert) Such as: Who did he end up with? How did he end up with that band? Was his co-lead singer a woman in drag? And finally, why the hell did they select places that went against his/her grain?Hopefully, one – or more – of my friends will answer these questionsbut I still want to see it again. With further understanding, perhaps my rating will increase. Either way, I'm definitely ordering the soundtrack soonokayordered. The soundtrack will be arriving between Monday, January 30, 2012 – Tuesday, February 14, 2012. Just in time for Valentine's Day or Arizona's 100th Birthday!",8,0,2,23 January 2012
Major League," The Police Academy of Baseball
","I must've seen the trailer for this movie many times - I recall only seeing this once before, but I remembered ALL the major scenes and jokes. And I still laughed at all the humor here.It's harmless fun, with the exception of such a racist mascot/name. Really should change those. But, regardless, the film is a ton of entertainment and laughs. Simple and classic. Total recommendation.And totally reminds me of the time I pitched for the Wyoming Wyldkats and made it all the way to the superbowl, until my arm got too sore to throw three-points. Shoot...not April 1st anymore. Skip this last part.",8,0,2,3 April 2019
The Dark Knight," Serious Stuff
","Falling extremely short of a masterpiece, it would be hard to label 'The Dark Knight' as my personal favorite superhero/comic book adventure of all time ('Superman: The Movie' has always held that spot). If it were just Heath Ledger's masterful, powerful, mesmerizing performance, I would still recommend as one of the best in recent years. However, though Ledger's Joker was so powerful, equal to, and possibly exceeding my favorite villain of all time, Hannibal Lector from 'The Silence of the Lambs,' the movie itself is so great in so many ways, it's hard to list them all in the space provided on this website. The score was powerful, the acting from Oldman, Freeman and Caine were very good, the dialogue excellent  and, at times, hilarious ('I'm going to need your gun.' 'Why, because my wife's in the hospital?' 'Yeah, that would be why.' And 'You think you can steal half our money and get away with it?' 'Yeah.') and the action scenes absolutely intense  well known for very little to no CGI  thanks Nolan, finally a real movie. Sure the audience/box office just eats up the shallow, fake-looking CGI-infested blockbusters ('Wanted' and 'Mummy 3') but finally, someone took heart to real film making. And the heart was throughout this film, script, performances and I consistently forgot I was watching a 'comic-book' movie  finally a realistic superhero film. Now, the few bad points  easily a half-hour could've been shaved, i.e. they could've kept the love-triangle while deleting Two-Face and I had no problem with Holmes from the original, but I did with Gyllenhaal, the weakest of all actors. Other than those minor problems, I still award 10 out of 10 stars, label it as the best Batman feature & best film in 2008.",10,2,6,25 December 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," The Phoenix has Risen Indeed
","I would begin my review of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix with the statement I've made before: A return to greatness, but sadly, the series, to date, has never been even close to this level of quality.True. And it's one of the biggest sequel-improvements of all time. Where Goblet of Fire (#4) was almost an entire waste of filmmaking, Order of the Phoenix (#5) leapt countless bounds past it and wasn't just a great Harry Potter chapter, but a fantastic film on its own merit.Let's see, when have I felt this way before during a series? Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (1/5 Stars) to the follow-up: Halloween: H20 (4½/5 Stars.) But, to be closer to home, or from a Part IV to V we have: Batman & Robin (1/5 Stars) to Batman Begins (4/5 Stars) or Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1/5 Stars) to Superman Returns (4/5 Stars.)Order of the Phoenix was a fantastic ride, filled with very good special effects, funny lines, the most beautiful cinematography since Prisoner of Azkaban (#3,) a (much needed) tight, well paced and crisp story with the most depth given in the most realistic way to the characters, a incredible story of good vs. evil, friendship and connection and had the best, the most exciting and suspenseful climatic finales of the series. In fact, if it had ended here, aside from the obvious doors left open, I would've been okay with that.BUT above all that, the fifth Harry Potter movie FINALLY contained direction, intensity, passion, a clear vision and lacked all the randomness that was thrown into the previous four installments. My main complaint, so far, was the chaotic and haphazard scenes that did not further the stories and were blatantly obvious scenes from the books to only appease that one demographic (the book-club fan) and not a new-comer like me. I have felt the series, leading up to and including number four, had been irresponsible in the sense they chose to be narrow-minded and forgo the art of making a movie to stand on its own two legs. Order of the Phoenix, didn't just have that; it had wings.I digress, Harry uses his powers in front of a non-wizard in order to save him setting off a chain of events leading up to the over-powering and blind Ministry to slowly, but surely, take control of the school. In real life, this would be called: the TSA.The most obvious of bad people, Miss Pink, is inadvertently causing Harry and his (this time) extended gang of friends to fight for themselves, literally, because The No-Nose, Man in Black is back.I wouldn't just recommend this movie to Harry Potter fans. I wouldn't just recommend this to normal Muggles. I would simply tell people to skip the first four and begin the series here. I'm almost joking.For the first time, from what I recall, the use of flashbacks and background events from the first chapters were shown. Gather what you need to put the pieces of the past together and save your time as this, the – THANK YOU! – shortest of all Harry Potter movies, is the tightest and best paced of all of the films.Needless to say, I had a ball here. It's the kind of story I want to see, the depth of characters, namely Harry Potter himself (FINALLY), that I want to enjoy and it's an adventure with heart that made me care for those on the screen. This is the first time I have said this about a Harry Potter feature: I can't wait to see this one again.(Editor's Note: I decided to listen to the masses for this Harry POTter phenomena and revisit the series. I've only seen the first two, both once and in first run theatres. Since it's been around a decade since the initial releases, I've started over with #1 and will get to what everyone calls: the better years. Cheerio!)",8,0,1,3 March 2013
2001: A Space Odyssey," Meanwhile, 2001 Minutes Later
","I think Lex Luthor said it best: 'Some people can read War and Peace and come away thinking it's a simple adventure story. Others can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and unlock the secrets of the universe.' I'm part of the first example there, while most find 2001: A Space Odyssey a masterpiece in filmmaking. And no doubt whatsoever: the cinematography, score and way-ahead-of-its-time space adventure is perfect. I will stand behind that statement throughout this review. But, sadly, those are the only positives I could come up with for this incredibly long and simple film.Before I continue, I must warn: this contains spoilers. I say this, because, as of tonight, April 24, 2013, I had never viewed 2001: A Space Odyssey before and I attempted to avoid as many spoilers as possible. So, if you haven't yet experienced this, watch at your own risk and then continue.Previously, I proclaimed that 'I attempted to avoid as many spoilers as possible.' Sadly, with a movie that has been talked about, researched and inspired countless of ideas/movies over the decades, it's hard to not view some of the key scenes, listen to the wall-played classical-music score or learn of the film's characters (HAL 9000, anyone?) Well, nothing I've seen, heard or learned prepared me for the absoluteslowestmovieIhaveEVER SEEN.The movie begins in darkness, for a few minutes. Sure, I heard music, but nothing on the screen. Quite literally, I thought my BluRay disc was damaged.(Oh, sorry. Backing up a bit: Since I've never seen this before and it's deemed a 'classic,' why not watch it for the first time on the excellent BluRay format? That, however, wasn't my first intention, actually. I wanted to purchase The Shining on BluRay, but after pricing the disc, I found, for just a few dollars more, there was a triple feature of The Shining, 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange. I've already seen numbers one and three, but heck, why not experience my initial reaction to 2001: A Space Odyssey on BluRay? Purchase: made.)Just when I was about to give up, the infamous primate scene emerged. Well, okay, not quite yet. Enter in many landscaping scenes and then about 20 minutes of zero dialogue and primates eating, drinking and eventually enamored by a good sized monolith, or black rectangular prism. Many years later, Wall-E would attempt the same feat with its opening act without a shred of dialogue. Pixar was much more successful in keeping my interest.I digress. Fast-forwarding to (oh, what year was this based in, again?) the 'far-distant future' while retaining the styles and dialogue of the 1960s, doctors embark on a mission of wonder of said monolith (now, ??) on the moon. Without explaining too much and opening up way too many doors, we will fast-forward again, but now, on a mission of wonder to Juniper. Only this time, we, well, 1960s American Audiences, get their first taste of later-down-the-road Android Ash from Alien. Apparently, after a communication breakdown – literally, HAL/ASH must complete the mission even when the humans are wiser to him.This should make me laugh, but like the opening 2-3 minutes of nothing, the movie chose to keep in the merciful INTERMISSION the audience was blessed with back in 1968. And I almost did laugh, thinking this snail-moving movie needed one. But, after a few minutes, I was tempted to fast-forward myselfsomething I never do while watching movies for the first time. Finally, what followed turned out to the most acid-tripped and psychedelic third act I've ever seen.Now, I didn't necessarily rate down the movie for the, what we call today: a cheap screensaver, because these are aliens and in their minds back then, anything's possible. But, what followed proves to me: Director Kubrick was on drugs. He had to have been. Truly.If you do travel down this hallucinatory journey, you'll see what I saw, or what I couldn't believe any more if Godzilla miraculously had showed up and explained, in English, verses his native Japanese tongue, what the last third of this movie meant.I fully understand where this movie was coming from and the year it was released, but what I couldn't get past were some basic and major flaws:A> Computer program HAL 9000 controlled the entire ship, and even the vessel to kill one of the men who wanted to shut him downbut couldn't control the second shuttle when another man wanted to rescue the obviously dead astronaut? Or, further, he failed to control the temperature, pressure or live-support when said 'hero' returns to the ship and goes to deactivate the deadly computer program?B> People of Earth, or higher-ups, that is, wanted to make first contact with the alien race that 'faced' Jupiter's planet from Earth's moon. So, they programmed HAL 9000 to make sure the ship got there. The first sign of trouble was a transmission breakdown and HAL 9000 thought best to let it fail with 'hopes' of fixing it later. If the higher-ups wanted to both explore the alien race and document it, wouldn't it be a top priority be to keep the communication up and running?C> Since I've never been to space, nor plan to, it's hard to prove this is a flaw: when one character decides to venture into the vacuum of space without adequate protection, albeit briefly, he's perfectly fine. Even though, I GUESS this could work, it was hard to get past and take the rest of the movie seriously.The movie's based on a short story, and it shows. It's an extremely thin plot stretched to the max. While I appreciate the scope of this project, especially the timeframe of release, I do not believe it holds up today. I'm glad it inspired numerous other projects, because it takes one good idea to make the future better.",3,2,7,25 April 2013
Toy Story," To Infinity And Beyond, this went.
","I told a friend I was going to re-watch 'Toy Story' in the theater due to it being a 'classic' in which he immediately disputed. I disagree. Much like 1977's 'Star Wars' or 'Citizen Kane,' 'Toy Story' was far before it's time and revolutionized it's genre, in this case: animation. In addition, they took it to the next level with creativity, a perfect combination of humor for both kids and adults as well as an excellent homage to toys people around my age grew up with. I was at the tail-end to some of the toys shown or in the middle when I was a child. So, of course, a great deal of smiles were on my face throughout in remembrance. But, as a movie-lover/amateur critic, it has to go beyond that. I won't like a movie without a great and original script/dialogue, deep characters, good pacing and surprises. This movie has them all. I loved the lines, the voices were pitch perfect, the adventure made up from just from imagination was inventive from minute one and all characters intersected beautifully. Just as child Andy's birthday party is to start, every toy (alive when no one else is around) is worried they'll be replaced and current head-toy cowboy Woody attempts to convince them otherwise. Unfortunately, it is he that's replaced by Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear (love the variances to his name, including 'Light-beer') who seemingly doesn't know he is anything but an astronaut. Not too far deep into the story is a touching realization/awakening for both and great learning for the people watching, kids and adults alike. Excellent movie, perfect start for the apparently unbeatable Pixar studios and suitable for all ages. (Side note: 2009's 3-D version worth watching, but adds little to the already masterpiece it is.)",10,0,0,11 October 2009
Men in Black," Who's Jonesing for an excellent Buddy Movie?
","Men in Black is one of those rare movies you don't want to end too soon, and 98 minutes is really too short.After all, they created (literally) a whole new universe, introduced some awesome alien and definitely great human characters and since it's an origin story, only about half of the movie do you get to see the dynamic duo in action.These sounds like complains, when in reality, I loved this movie.I saw Men in Black many years ago and I remembered liking it a lot. Perhaps, becoming relatively jaded in the quality of movies since made me forget on how excellent this movie was. All actors were dead on or near pitch-perfect in their roles, the comedy was huge, Tommy Lee Jones once again proved how wonderful he is as the straight man and Will Smith continued his leading man/comedy role greatly. Also, this movie introduced me to a wonderful actress, Fiorentino. (Too bad, she didn't return for the sequel.) But, as much as I like acting in movies, it didn't end there. The sets, cinematography, special effects (even at 13 years old now, it trumps a lot of movies today,) the comedy, score, screenplay, originality and action/adventure were all top notch. Barely a flaw I could see with this, possibly aside from the sad closing (SEE: Kay's decision) and Smith, though funny, was really just doing what he did best. Again.After a top secret agent of a top secret elite force retires, Kay (Jones) seeks out a new partner in rogue NYC cop Edwards (Smith,) who, of course, has to inevitably give up everything (which is nothing) to become Kay's partner Jay. It takes him a little while to learn the role of Alien Ambassador (with punked out guns and gadgets) and while he's getting adjusted, you'll fall in love with Jones's deadpan humor. Again, he plays the perfect straight man to wacky, on the edge and unorthodox Jay.Meanwhile, a 'bug' or bad attitude giant cockroach inhabits a human body in order to steal the galaxy, which of course another space race wants back, even at the expense of Earth. Will supermen Jay & Kay (and with the help of many zany characters (LOVE Frank the Pug,) and a mortician (Fiorentino)) solve the case and save the PLANET?! Is it really a spoiler to say This is a must see. It's sad more movies can't be made like this today. Again, the special effects actually trump many since this, barely a moment did I not believe this universe they crafted didn't exist. (Well, Okay, I said barely: Smith delivering a child and being swung around wasn't 100% perfect, but still a good scene, again, thanks to Jones.) Though a bit gory at times, perhaps slimy and some bugaphobics might want to look away at times, everyone should see this fantastic adventure.",9,1,1,6 February 2010
Puss in Boots," My Kind of Puss in Boots Movie
","Thank you Shrek for not only taking a back seatbut for not even showing up.After the enormously disappointing last two Shrek films, his absence from the feature-length Puss In Boots, reminded me of the last major election when all Republican candidates distanced themselves far from the horrid George W. Bush endorsement. Heck, they didn't want to be even seen with him.Puss's detachment from old pal Shrek was warmly welcomed as was the lack of the usual and over-used origin story attached to a spin-off movie. In fact, the short time they spent on how Puss got his boots, was fantastic, cute, original and a lot of fun. That said, I wouldn't want the whole film based around a Kitten Looking for Boots.The movie as a whole a grand adventure, perfect for kids and adults. The story wasn't completely original and wildly predictable, but it was perfect for the younglings while the adventure, action, comedy and homage excellent for adults.And speaking of homage, the inevitable and integrated Shrek-franchise fairy-tales weren't over done and more part of the story, than (said in best MadTV Stuart's voice) 'Look at what I can do!' from the previous movies. On a personal note, these are the ones I most grew up with: Humpty (Alexander) Dumpty and Jack and the Beanstalk. (That last one was one of my all-time favorites as a kid, and when Disney redid it, oh, it was like Christmas.)Puss and an oh-so-not-mysterious dueling cat team up with said Mr. Dumpty to get the goose that lays the golden eggs, but are wanted by the town folk and chased by, ah hem, Jack and Jill. (Now why couldn't Adam Sandler's feature length film take be as entertaining?) Puss needs to clear his name and save the town while finding time for love.There. That was the basic premise. See? Great for kids. As was all the adventure and inventive scenes and gorgeous cinematography and graphics. This all will entertain adults as well, not boring them for a moment.Finally, Antonio Banderas, who already starred in 3 previous films with this same character, breathes fresh life into the best character in the entire Shrek franchise. Unlike Cleveland from Family Guy, this character not only deserved his own spin-off, he can carry it. Further, most minor/secondary characters need to rely on those kooky new characters to fill in the gaps of the normal 90-minute timeframe. Not this time; while the co-stars were fun and entertaining, Puss held his own throughout and makes me welcome a Puss 2 Boots.As long as it's more Puss Adventures and NOT leading us any closer to his meeting of Shrek.",8,3,3,26 February 2012
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Welcome to Total Rekall. Forget Someone?
","Disclaimer – Stop now, if you haven't seen this picture. Don't read this, any synopsis or any review. WATCH THIS MOVIE. Dammit, you won't be disappointed. That is, if you love cinema and fine pieces of art some movies are. Then come back to my take. See if my views match yoursHow happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!I'm no poet, nor do I normally favor it over other mediums. But this snippet of Alexander Pope's poem is as mesmerizing as the excellently written movie it takes its name from. If only I could write a story with such great intentions, romance, suspense, comedy and heart.I truly loved this movie. I love the fact that it starts in normal Jim Carrey fare – Goofy with a touch of romance, but sooner than you think, you're drawn into a science fiction story of a mind-erasing clinic for love-lost humans. And by the time you think you've discovered all the movie is about, it splashes the whole picture across your face and it tricks you. You've been watching an incredibly deep and romantic picture all along.Talk about one of the all-time best written screenplays. It even dupes me each time, though since I enjoy it so much, I allow it to twist and turn me until I've been eternally satisfied all over again. So much so, after each viewing, I just sit back with wide-eyed amazement and in complete awe of the creators of this movie.The scenery is beautiful, the soundtrack and score wonderful and the performances by the leads – Carrey, Ruffalo and Wilkinson are great while Winslet is perfect. Again, along with the story, you think she's some kook – I would, if I met her in real life, but the depths of both her character, Clementine and the performer, herself, gives me shivers. Thinking small, you will call her a great actress. As a whole, she will surely go down as one of the greatest actresses of all time. Heck, I even liked her in Titanic, but following that movie, she's blown me away each and every time making her 'Rose' character in the big boat movie look like a High School play.Despite not giving away a synopsis of the movie, I feel like I've given away far too much. Suffice to say, if you like a great movie with depth deeper than the abyss all wrapped up in a movie that screams independent, watch this movie. It's one of the few movies that not only makes you want to press stop at the end and re-play from beginning. In fact, you will. I did.",10,1,3,22 August 2010
Elysium," Pie in the Sky
","I skipped this movie in the theatres for several reasons: I'm not into sci-fi that much, I couldn't pronounce the name and damn, it did NOT look original in the slightest. I can say, Elysium did not disappoint...in those categories.Okay, admittedly, I had a slightly good time here. It's a completely leave-your-brain-at-the-door feature with barely acceptable acting and dialogue and good special effects. The action and story is absolutely nothing new, the character depth is minimal at best and stillit's a tad bit fun. Namely with side character/actor: Julio (Diego Luna.) Even he wasn't fresh, but still interesting (and cute) enough.Surprise! We've destroyed the world, once again and for the millionth time, in the future and the privileged rest comfortably in a space station above the Earth. In a shocking twist – not really, but for those who've seen maybe 2 movies in their life – there's a power struggle up there and the poor want in, regardless.One thing I definitely appreciate about Director/Writer Neill Blomkamp of District 9 fame, is his love of the antihero up front. In this case, it's Matt Daaaay-mon's Max. He does have an additional level of depth to his character and he's right there with Julio with some specs of characters to watch in an overly blah story.Sure, okay, the special effects are somewhat good, not great, nor spectacular. In fact, I expected more from what I was shown in District 9. But, they were good, nonetheless.I can see why this movie bombed. I cannot believe for a second that Blomkamp thought this was something new. None of it is. There's not a fresh aspect of this entire movie. It's a wasted effort from an obviously talented man. Sadly, for a no-name (so far,) he's gotta do a lot better than this to make him a real-name.* * * Final thoughts: Despite all I wrote above, still, it's worth a Saturday-in night at the movies. It's not a complete waste and fun when you do, in fact, leave your brain at the door and forget the countless other movies just like this.",4,1,3,31 December 2013
Taken," The Bourne Retirement Home
","After a rather long set up opening segment, with painfully obvious dialogue and scenes to give 'clues' on where this was headed, 'Taken' doesn't, well, take us anywhere we don't already know where it's going (from the zillion trailers or simply just the opening set-up) and all the way to the final act. However, what a ride it was. Thoroughly enjoyable action scenes, Liam Neeson (seriously, one of the best actors of all time and we still forgive you for 'Star Wars' Episode 1, even though you did the best with what George would allow) was again excellent and it contained a lot of funny and smart lines, mostly from Neeson. I always enjoy Jean Grey (uh, Famke Janssen) but in this film, she was an obvious one-note, as were all the characters outside of Neeson. Strange, for someone so incredibly non-violent in our reality, he's just deadly in 'Taken' and really shows us what 'The Bourne Retirement Home' will look like once Matt Damon finally grows up. This is strictly for fans of the 'Bourne' films, Fox's '24' series and Neeson. Predictable, yes, unoriginal, well, yeah, and it doesn't trump 'Bourne' (nowhere close) but it was exciting to see what Neeson's Bryan would do next or how he would get out of a situation. I'm glad writer Luc Besson didn't include his staple Jason Statham to play the lead character, Bryan, as he would definitely fit the role. Neeson saved what would've been just a retread  retired  revenge  romp. Bryan: 'I'm retired. Not dead.' Enough said.",7,0,1,1 February 2009
This Is Spinal Tap," This was Funny
","If this movie had a message, it's judging a book by its cover(s) is probably right.Truthfully, due to the stills I saw, the poster and timeframe (I was 10 when this came out and not my cup of tea back then,) I had zero desire to see thisuntil a special friend showed it to his kids during one of his many incredible marathons he hosts for them. So, finally, after three decades, I finally learned more about 'the band.'Now, in my (very weak) defense, all jokes would've flown straight over my decade-old head and the many, many actors involved – I would've recognize, yet. So, it's probably best to see it as an adult anyways. I'm super glad I finally did.The movie was hilarious and a ton of this held up 32 years after release. Plus, I couldn't believe how many actors I recognized even though they may/may not have even been slightly known back then. Practically every scene or two, someone else popped up that I was like 'Oh! That's ____!' But, beyond the stars Rob Reiner got to appear, the movie was genuinely funny. Personally, I thought it had more opportunities to be hilarious, but then I wasn't one of the writers and might have changed the tone to a ton more slapstick. It is what it is and that isgood comedy.Basically, it's a mockumentary (God, I love those) about an aging and D- List rock band who go through most of what real life bands do sans drugs. Not sure why that wasn't touched on, but again NOT-writer here. The music was actually good, the direction of the decline in the band's tour realistic to the storyline and running gags (drummer boys, anyone?) always humorous. Plus it's runtime at a mere 82 minutes was JUST enough. Nothing else needed to be said. Any additional footage probably would've hindered the film.Totally a recommendation if you've never seen this. ***Final thoughts: Long before Russell Brand was a brand, this has his style/name written all over it. Hope for no remake, but I can see him in one of the roles, easily.",8,0,1,23 July 2016
Alice in Wonderland," Want real wonder? Skip Avatar and join Alice
","Honestly, I didn't expect I would like 2010's remake Alice in Wonderland. I did expect all FX and no story or acting, a la Avatar. Enjoying this as much as I did shows why never to judge a book by its cover. (Or other movie reviews, to be precise.) Thankfully, though, I didn't have much to base this on as I have never read any of the books and even though I wasn't a huge fan of the original animated Disney film in 1951, I haven't seen that one in a very long time to remember enough to compare this to. So, I basically went in with a clean slate and saw what Director Tim Burton wanted me to see. As usual, it was his vision.I was blown away. I loved the spectacle of the Underland, the characters, the actual wonder of the film. Sure it had its flaws, but overall it's a must-see, especially in IMAX 3-D.Young Alice has nightmares of a 'wonder land' of strange characters, including a smiling cat and is comforted by her adventurous and free-spirited father. Fast-forward to 'present' day when Alice's 19, her father's long gone and she's courted to marry someone she just met as per custom in royalty. Well, taking a lot from her father, whom meant the world to her, she becomes the Runaway Fiancé and lands into the infamous rabbit hole.Much like The Chronicles of Narnia and Hook combined, the movie shifts to the odd characters tugging her to this place or that to eventually rid the Underland of the Red Queen by slaying her pet, as foretold by a scroll. The lesson here kids? Alice must choose her destiny and not have her destiny choose her.As much as I loved the surreal and wonderful world of down-below, I did have some complaints that withdrew a full star from my rating. (Some of this might be spoilers, so you can skip two paragraphs as not to have things revealed.) #1 Why Be Like Hook? If you're gonna make a huge budgeted remake – why start with part two? Though, I did favor this tenfold over Steven Spielberg's Hook, in a sense, they were the same movie. Older Alice/Peter inadvertently gets thrown back into their retrospective 'adventure lands' and take almost the ENTIRE movie to remember who they are – despite every character shouting at them all the way who they really are. I would've preferred a retelling of the original classic, Alice's first adventure to Wonderland.#2 The Chronicle of Narnia's Final Battle seemed forced. Yes, it was foretold, but it seemed like it was just there to mimic Disney's other (unfortunately, failing) franchise. In addition, following was a pretty lame attempt at The Wizard of Oz's conclusion. Perhaps that was part of the book that I missed, but not only did Alice barely change throughout the movie, when she reentered the human world after realizing this was not but a dream, it was as if nothing happened. She shared Dorothy from Oz's sentiments, but lacked the true emotion.Those said, I liked all the characters and was thrilled they weren't what my own expectations of them to be, i.e. they kept throwing my visions of who they were supposed to be out the window. I liked to be surprised. Despite the previously mention finale, Alice (Wasikowska) did a wonderful job, Mad Hatter (Depp) was good as, again, I expected Willy Wonka and he most certainly created a new character and Red Queen (Carter) was great at being bad, very bad. The twins, or Tweedledee and Tweedledum (Lucas) were two of my favorites in adding humor and Cheshire Car (Fry) was awesome as was the White Rabbit (Sheen.) The only ones I didn't care much for were the White Queen (Hathaway) and Stayne (Glover) for Hathaway didn't sway too far from her other established characters and Stayne was the only graphic I didn't buy throughout the whole movie.This brings me to another point. As everyone's still googly-eyed over the 'spectacle' of Avatar, I found the entire Alice in Wonderland to be so much more believable in graphics, characters and background than even five minutes of Avatar. All except for the too-tall character of Stayne. Luckily, though an important character that does appear for just under half the feature, he doesn't dominate the screen for 90% of the movie like those laughably unrealistic blue smurfs (Na'vi .) Seriously, I never thought for a moment they weren't in Wonderland, or Underland, but I had a huge problem buying the goofy Na'vi and that turned me off for nearly all of Avatar.At any rate, I would thoroughly recommend the wonder of Wonderland. Everyone seemed to have a good time (in the film, that is) and it's nice and tight, quick and to the point. It gives you what you came for, just the right amount and didn't make you yearn for more. Though I would still see a sequel – pending all parties involved here return, I really wouldn't want one. I liked how this pretty much summed it up, and in spades. Or is thathearts?",8,2,7,8 March 2010
The Mummy Returns," We Now Return to the Same Movie. Sort of.
","How on earth can one movie have such an impact, please so many people, make so much moneythat they honestly believe spending a buck fifty on special effects for the follow-up is a good idea?The special effects, namely The Rock's Scorpion King, was so bad in The Mummy Returns, I honestly couldn't get past it. Yes, I know FX doesn't make the whole movie experience, but these were so comical, so cartoonish – and even in 2001 – that the movie was more of an unintentional comedy that the humor it tried hard to produce.The movie is, in fact, bookended by the worst special effects, namely the laugh-out-loud pasted on Rock's head finale, but the overall movie was so much a recap of the original 1999, that I barely remembered I was watching the sequel.Granted, they decided the best way to make more money or milk this franchise dry like the deserts its set in, is just to rehash everything from The Mummy (1999.) In fact, the only thing that really changed was the transformation of the actual 'mummy' took mere seconds when the first film took much more efforts from the characters.The basic plot revolves around a soul-selling warrior – a la Scorpion King, the new adventures of the new O'Connell family and the Mummy's Revenge, sort of.Look, I've only seen this movie once in theatres in 2001 and just one more time about a week ago. I've put off the review until now and I've seemed to forget everything that happened in this movie, aside from a fairly decent car/bus chase scene I did like, set in London and the atrocious and hilarious Scorpion King finale. One that was so bad, I never bothered with the spin-offs. Even if they advanced in CGI, I seriously couldn't care less to revisit that character.This doesn't fair well for this movie. If it's so unmemorable in less than one week, it doesn't get any kind of recommendation from me.",3,0,0,19 May 2013
Avatar," Ripley Loves Aliens, News at 11.
","I hesitated, almost a full month, before seeing Avatar, a movie that apparently the world saw first. And when I saw world, I mean everyone, even people who have never see a movie, or even have the technology or places to go to see movies, saw it. I delayed my viewing as it was not a movie I was interested in seeing in the first place and the trailer made me snicker at the tall, skinny Smurf people.But, I broke down and saw it, as I knew I was going to see it anyways and the small screen, or even a 60' would probably not do the large scale/action flick justice. Even further, I needed to see it in IMAX-3-D just to get the whole effect. Was I disappointed? Yes and no.The special effects were amazing as was the cinematography. That was breathtaking. But the FX and scenery was only good whenthe blue people (or the Na'vi) weren't on the screen. Yes, I realize they're on practically the whole time you enjoy the rest of the CGI-world of Pandora, and I think the technology has thoroughly advanced through the years, but I just didn't buy it. I just didn't think they're there just yet. I almost laughed each time I saw them, but I never truly believed them to be anything but computer generated images. Everything else, aside from one of the dog-like creatures looked absolutely fabulous.Unfortunately, looks can be deceiving. For example, as stunning as the 90% of the graphics were, in addition to the flights, the story looked as old and stale as most of the moments in human history it mimicked. I guess it was no secret the plot is without any teeth or any bit of originality, so stating it's a VERY A-B-C movie is just irrelevant. My guess is they (or just King Cameron) knew this, he's not stupid, and just said let's just throw in as many tricks/CGI/gadgets as they could possibly think of as distractions to deter from the central plot. It is very well known to people I associate with, that story comes first, always. I could be thrown a million things (even in 3-D) but that doesn't stop me from looking deeper for anything resembling not only originality, but heart.Was the movie bad? No, I wouldn't go that far, but the race to cover up the lack-of-story with a billion FX kinda got old and made me look at the time more than once. Not only was I kinda bored with the attempts to impress me, but I was still waiting for the basic 'C' elements of the A-B-C plot-formula (which, mercifully, finally arrived.) The basic storyline (a Dances with Wolves with the Titanic theme – dang, I got really frustrated with hearing Titanic all throughout this film, because Titanic was 12x better a movie) involves a last minute death of a man who was supposed to inhabit a Na'vi body in the long-distant future in order to infiltrate an alien species on another planet. His mission was to bring back information or (ha-ha, like I believed this) negotiate a 'relocation' of the Na'vi so that Earthmen can harvest a rare substance in order to reboot Planet Earth after humans did a fine job of destroying it.Well, thank goodness, the dead spy had a twin brother, but unfortunately, he's also paralyzed from the waist down. That doesn't really matter when your mind is transferred to a 12' Na'vi body. I'm spending way too much time on this 15-minute-plot, so I'll fast forward (and it's no shocker when it's all spoiled in the previews, anyways.) He joins scientists, gets separated and meets up with a Na'vi (or make that naïve) woman, Naytiri (Saldana,) who spiritually think he's the chosen one.She trains him while he remains loyal to a very bad man (or high ranking military cliché who works for someone so incredibly cartoonish – Parker (Ribisi) – that I had to laugh at every unbelievable moment he was on screen.) But lo! He starts to see life in the blue, becomes one of the blue and its: Red, White and Blue vs. the other Blue.The handicapped character-turned-spy, Jake (Worthington, or, again, I should say Worthless,) is so brain-dead that whenever Naytiri hits him in the forehead and calls him a child, I wanted to join her, but instead just punch him. Yes, I get the fact they wanted to show a transformation, but this extremely-dumb-as-a-box-of-rocks was so hard to watch, it should've been played by Keanu Reeves who might have given him more depth as a surfer-dude.Would I recommend it? For special effects and fantastic scenery/scope, alone and the inevitable 'Ewoks' finale made up for a lot of the movie's downfalls. Obviously, the general movie public (or in this case the entire Earth) likes familiarity. I, on the other hand, like to be amazed by screenplays that took more than a few hours to construct.Either way, I would recommend, if you would ever see it, you need to see it on the big screen. I did, and I am thankful, now that I did and saw little to no depth, I can safely save money on foreseeable future Avatar sequels.",3,1,4,15 January 2010
Toy Story 2," The New Buzz
","I used to love the follow-up 'Toy Story 2' more than its predecessor. After a good 3-D viewing in 2009, I flip-flopped them. Yes, I think #2 was awesome, near perfect, and just as much fun and inventive as the first one, but I think it was slightly off. Just barely. I think it's Cusack's 'Jessie' that I found almost unbearable to watch. Sure, I get her character and where it's coming from, but God, she was annoying and hard to get past. On the positive, she gave the only notable song, and a good one too, in the series so far: 'When She Loved Me' by Sarah McLachlan. Other than that, they certainly up'd the ante for the technology (even with only a few years in between), the action/adventure, comedy but all the while kept the great 'family/friends' feel and morals. To switch things up, Woody now has been 'toy-napped' and it's up to Buzz and peers (still great, never missing a beat from what made them all masterful in #1) to rescue him. I loved the additions to the 'story' such as the Barbie's, Knight's Chicken/thief, the new Buzz (love the explanation given to what stores did wrong the previous Christmas) and Buzz's nemesis. This was a fun movie to start with and as it progressed, it got a lot better. A lot more fun, adventure, touching and inventive. Rarely will a sequel live up to its original, and 'Toy Story 2' is one of the best ever. It's very apparent that the crew, directors, cast, animators all had enormous fun putting this out, adding all of their own little homages (also seen in #1.) Side note: the 3-D was good, but Disney can never blow me away as other studios have: SEE: 'Monsters Vs. Aliens.'",9,0,1,11 October 2009
Drag Me to Hell," Dragged to Hell
","Though it was nice to see Raimi return to his true roots after all-but selling out to 'Spider-Man' with 'Drag Me to Hell,' unfortunately, this really appeared to be an overlong 'Tales from the Crypt' episode. Sure, that's not necessary a bad thing; it's always nice to get that feeling again when we were kids/young adults growing up on such horror classics such as 'Crypt' or Raimi's 'Evil Dead' series. (And before I move on, I would like to clarify, I really did like Spidey 1/2, but comparatively speaking, most of Raimi's best work is with horror/suspense, such as: 'A Simple Plan.') In 'Hell' we have bank employee yearning for a promotion over an eager new employee. She has other life problems, but none as great as the curse an old gypsy woman bestows upon her after she denies a third extension on her foreclosing home, in order to lock in the promotion. For three days, legend states, she will be tormented and then, literally dragged to hell. Unless, of course, she can find one of many loopholes. What I liked about 'Hell' is the head-on obvious horror movie clichés, not attempting to hide, but embracing them, never taking itself too seriously. And sure most of the film was for shock/scare value, vomit and other liquids poured into her mouth, etc.But, as always there's holes: woman waits 40 years for another chance at defeating the main demon, however charges the main character $10,000 she doesn't have for the séance. That's like getting hired for the job you really wanted and asking the interviewer, 'Are you sure you made the right choice?' Also, if she truly is the vegetarian she claimed to be, how come she made that cake with eggs? Isn't that considered murder? I'm not sure, since I'm a meat eater, but isn't even cracking eggs, or worse, beating them, kind of harsh on what could've been a life? And the closing climax was obvious 20 minutes prior, so it takes awhile to see what we already know what's coming. Still, recommended for the demon-horror movie fans.Side note: My job at work is to help people save homes. I was laughing out loud prior to this movie, as it very well could've been a five minute movie (including opening and closing credits) as if just that bank employee simply referred the gypsy over to my agency or a similar HUD certified housing counseling company. The lady would avoid the curse, the gypsy would've continued her black magic alone at home, the bank would've profited. Everyone wins. Well, except the audience that spent 10+ dollars on a five-minute film. This is probably the reason I've never been invited to Hollywood studio board meetings. Well, probably.",5,1,5,31 May 2009
Grindhouse," Find the Double Feature, and then watch in reverse
","So much better a double feature 'Grindhouse' was than the poor excuse home video was. It was no surprise they separated them for 2 DVD releases for the old-Disney trick of attempting to make more money. I saw this, all 3+ hours of glory in the theater. The only problem I had with it was the order of films. Much like Quentin Tarantino's 'Kill Bill' series, he saved the SLOWEST for last. Not that I didn't like 'K.B.II,' I did, but it was so much slower than the first. As in the case of 'Grindhouse.' Where the first of two feature length movies, 'Planet Terror' was hilarious, gruesome, exciting, an awesome homage to the old drive-in features and extremely action packed, Tarantino slows the action to almost to a halt in 'Death Proof.' Not that I wouldn't recommend 'Proof' – it was still good, and had some great (Tarantino-style) dialogue and great acting amongst Russell and some of the girls. But, it was almost a let down from the high/adrenaline rush 'Terror' gave. Strange, I didn't grow up in the grindhouse days, and have seen as many drive-in movies as I can count on one hand, but I certainly understood where they were coming from, or already knew by my film studies. A lot of the homages they threw in where downright hilarious, such as changing the title at the last possible second, or the missing reels. I was rolling in the theater with what they came up with, while never questioning the lack of realism in what was happening. And as the original 'Halloween II' did to 'Mr. Sandman,' 'Proof' did to 'Chick Habit' in its finale. Saved best for last: Those previews were outrageously hilarious. If you do get to see this (these) films, make sure not to miss the coming attractions.",9,2,4,10 June 2009
The Artist," Thee Artist
","Last year I had a hard time coming up with #1 on my Top Ten of 2011 list and even though I ordered the top four, it was pretty much a 4-way tieuntilI finally saw 'The Artist' (5/5 Stars) or a better title: 'The Masterpiece.' I'm not going back to change my list, but this is by far the best of 2011 and one of the best movies I have EVER SEEN. I can't even count the number of attributes to the beauty of this film, but I'll try: Originality, gorgeous cinematography (yes, even for a B&W film), great dialogue (yes, even for a silent film), perfect acting all around, depth, chemistry, hope and just a sincere pleasure to watch. One of my favorites, not listed, was the ability to move the story along without an intertitle card. The acting, gestures, story and fantastic score moved us along so brilliantly, we could just rely on the actors vs. the obvious spoken words. All players, er, artists, were having so much fun recreating a great era of cinema you can see it ooze out of them with each facial expression and body language. This is, indeed, a masterpiece to be enjoyed, studied and watched by all who enjoy true cinematic works. Actually, just make that everyone should see this. My bet, before seeing this, was that it would win the Oscar for best Picture. After seeing it, I feel it should also win best cinematography, actor, actress, screenplay, score, and sound. It would be a crime if it didn't.",10,1,4,22 January 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," As Funny as Part 1 and Part 1
","I finally got it. After three real movies and an obscene attempt at extracting more money by splitting up Breaking Dawn into two parts, I understand what this series is all about. It was meant to introduce a new audience to soap operas since most of the daytime programs have been cancelled.There is no other explanation. Both the soaps on TV and the Twilight films have paper thin plots, terrible dialogue and acting so atrocious that even Michael 'ahhh-oh-AHHH!' Sheen must've known when signing on he gave up any hopes of getting an Oscar in the future.But, I will give this movie some credit and make note of one scene that will make the entire nightmare worthy of a watch: in an incredible series of accidentally amusing segments, they actually taught Bella to become Kristen Stewart. I was already laughing so hard during the comical special effects to the creepy digitized demon baby to the close ups so near to the screen that I was glad that it wasn't in 3-D or their nose hairs would've been closer than desired, but when they literally tell Bella to be a stiff actor, emotionless, melancholy and slow, I lost it. Bella, meet Kristen Stewart.I'm not sure if they were acknowledging Stewart is one of the worst actresses of all time and the scene was tongue-in-cheek, but it was funny, nonetheless.What wasn't funny was the endless, sad and racist stereotypes portrayed throughout. It's almost as if the novel's writer was a Mormon. Oh, waitAnyways, everything reverts back to the original film with the amount of stares, the sometimes there and sometimes missing white faces, the terrible CGI including Bella running through what appears to be the Moon of Endor, but ends up looking more like in she's jogging in an awful 20 cent 1980s music video, the sickening jokes and the joyless, pale and blank looks between the actors. That last one was one of my favorite scenes as the camera panned from one dumbfounded face to the next. I found myself pointing off the screen as if directing the camera to film the next boorish and expressionless glare.Those were the similarities of the original Twilight. Since they just 'had to' split the (oh, God, let it be the) final book into two, the screenplay, if there was one, appeared to be completed on one side of a toilet paper square. And if you are curious to see this film, much like that square, you'll know exactly where the final project ended up.Let's see if I can write the entire movie down on one toilet paper square:Bella and Edward are newlyweds. Bella's a 'new born' who needs to feed on cartoon animals. Jacob now smells and put his stank on an infant, which never gets less disturbing. The supposedly strong, though never proved, high council is upset a half-breed might harm their 'race.' Different clichés from around the globe are summoned to negotiate. A 'battle' ensures.Yep, it all fits and I still have room forAnd that's what this movie is. No two ways around it. People who like this crud will continue to defend it. More power to them – for liking what they like. Soaps were around for decades and though I didn't like them, I saw their appeal to desperate housewives.As everyone has a right to their opinions, no one should ever be dishonest to themselves and think these are well made movies. There is not a single scene – from the aren't-we-past stock footage shots to the panning from one endlessly shocked-expression face to the next to the blatant racial discrimination to the poor and immature dialogue and monologues – that constitutes a quality film.Despite how much fun it is to watch these unintentionally hilarious films, this series is just plain trash and I'm glad it's over.",1,21,57,18 November 2012
Mission: Impossible," Mission for Dummies
","(This review is heavy on spoilersbut it's also 16 years old and it's your fault if you haven't seen this yet)Perhaps it's unfair to finally get around to re-watching and reviewing the original 1996 Mission: Impossible. The evolution of each movie is so clear that this looks it was a lost episode of the 1960s TV show it was based on.And it feels like it's been that long since I've seen this. I remember disliking it and wrongfully being confused – I can't see why now, but I never realized how much I didn't care for it. Mercifully and much like the franchise has evolved, the original does get better as it progresses.Only your mission is to get through the first half before the fun begins.The movie opens up with what I'm guessing is 1st year spies. It's one thing to explain to the audience this gadget does this, or causes this harm, but for the characters to act foolish like they know less than the typical non-espionage viewer, is just plain pathetic. Prime example is poor, out-of-place, Kristin Scott Thomas who, apparently, never heard of either the TV program or any spy-film before.Worse than these high school dropouts posing as international agents, is that they kill off the majority of the team within 25 minutes from the start. YOU DON'T DO THAT – or the original series wouldn't have lasted as long, obviously.And what's even worse than that? (Fast forwarding to the end) YOU DO NOT MAKE JIM PHELPS THE BAD GUY. Seriously? I can see why they did it – the star, Tom Cruise, wasn't going to play the older, white-haired leader and they (or most likely he) wanted to give the pending franchise to his Ethan Hunt character. Fine, but you still don't make the long-lasting hero the villain. You don't even kill him off – just make him retire, disappear using his own skills, etc.Anyhoo, the movie focuses a diskette containing undercover CIA operative's names purposely getting into the wrong hands to both capture the bad guys and revealing the double agent. Yes, I said diskette – the old 3½ inch diskette that probably couldn't even hold the contents of this review, let alone any kind of list as big as described in the movie.I digress. As mentioned, the amateurish crew is dismissed early and Ethan 'Wake up, Claire! Jim's dead! He's DEAD! They're ALL DEAD!' Hunt is blamed. This is where it gets good – for a few moments. After he meets the fantastic Vanessa Redgrave as Max, he recruits future staple and great Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and short-timer Franz Krieger (Jean Reno) to break into the CIA headquarters and the (at the time) wildly original, tense and fantastic wire-hanging scene takes place.Of course, just so the movie does escalate past the 2 stars I gave it, during the best scene, there's a rat – REALLY? – that scares/distracts Franz in an air duct. Much like the first half of the movie, this makes me feel they weren't taking any of this too seriously, making this just a few steps above Get Smart.Following that, and literally jumping to the end, there's a fantastically unrealistic leap of faith from a helicopter and a super-train in a tunnel that makes me unintentionally laugh every time I see it.The movie made a huge mistake of being mostly spy and very little action, whereas Part II was also wrong at playing the opposite card. Luckily, they *finally* hit their stride with Part III and Ghost Protocol that, rightfully, matched both needed qualities equally.This actually very slow 'action' movie, which does contain a somewhat reminiscent of older spy-films, albeit dumbed down, was just a misstep from fairly decent director, Brian De Palma. It's almost worth a shot, just to find out who Ethan Hunt is and why Jim Phelps doesn't show up in the sequels. It did contain some decent cinematography and a very good score, but overall it's a miss. Thankfully, the sequels, with the exception of parts III and Ghost Protocol, are pretty much stand alone so you don't have to endure this experience.'I've been disavowed,' says Ethan. Don't worry: it won't be your last time.",4,0,1,26 February 2013
Saw," See Saw
","Let the games begin. And so they did in the original 'Saw.' Crafty, original, simple and suspenseful this mystery/horror 'Saw' was. The unfortunate biggest flaw was not really the movie itself, but the torn-porn trend Hollywood jumped on and since, produced dozens upon dozens of imitations and far less quality pictures (including 'Saw's own sequels.) Aside from that, I was quite pleased, though disturbed (with the violence and gore) with the concept of a serial killer that doesn't kill. In 'Saw,' two men wake up in the dirtiest of scummy bathrooms, chained and armed with a mission (rules, if you will) to not only put all the pieces together on how to survive, but how to decipher on the reasons behind their imprisonment. Multiple flashbacks and exterior shots, whether presently or in the past, make the viewer actually think for once and try and solve their dilemma as well. I'm simplifying this, it was a great concept, and despite the low budget, excellently made. For those not used to horror, or in the trend previously mentioned: 'torture porn,' this is not for the squeamish. It's enormously gruesome and hard to watch at times. However, I liked the message, though it was a rough ride to get to it. And the message? Simple: Appreciate life. If one can get past the gore and really listen to what the brains behind the operations – Jigsaw, then you'll get it too. In fact, take this as a lesson and go out to enjoy life now, before something like this happens to you. I'm kidding – I certainly hope this never happens. Years after Freddy, Jason, the 'Scream' ghost, Hannibal, et al, Jigsaw stands amongst them and played beautifully by the actor playing him. (No spoiler on who it is; that's part of the game.)",9,0,1,26 September 2009
Mama," Mama's Day Off
","Mama is certainly not a Mother's Day gift I would like to present to my mom. Even if she liked horror movies.While it was nice to have a diverse group of family members in the tired ghost genre as of late, especially involving Jessica Chastain play a different, albeit The Runaways, role, the movie was all over the place with just as many plot holes as the ghost created to teleport.Even though not seen, but implied nonetheless, the movie opens with violent acts against both family and, sadly, very young children. Father decides that the best method to deal with the recession is to point-blank kill his wife, two infant children and probably himself, but gets interrupted by the title character.For the next five years, the children are cared for by said 'Mama Ghost' with a rundown place that never gets cleaned or heck, dusted and fed, incredibly, a diet of rolling cherries of unknown origin or explanation.Mercifully (or not) for the children, the kids' uncle spends every last dime, and more so, to find them. Only, they bring some deadly baggage with them and are forced to deal with, for the most part, the barely committed punk rocker girlfriend of the Uncle who showed the true meaning of the Evil Stepmother.Despite the violent ideas in the opening, the movie started off well and continued that way until about the second half where it lost steam, direction and headed right over a cliff of a finale.I do not believe I have spoiled anything you can't read in a basic synopsis or wouldn't understand had you not seen the movie, but I would really be spoiling a whole lot more if I pointed out all that was wrong with this mess of a screenplay. I can say that most will be raising eyebrows when the end is revealed and one realizes the entire movie could've been over with in mere minutes.Oh, and get ready for some laugh out bad CGI and ghost movements. People: it's 2013, not 1984. Ghostbusters is absolutely forgiven for the abilities back then. No need to mimic them in today's time.Send Mama to the Home.",3,2,9,10 May 2013
Super 8," Cloverfield: The Beginning
","J.J. Abrams doesn't like to give away much, especially in his film's trailers. It's a wonder they ever make moneyÂ…for those who don't know who he is.He did it with 2008's Cloverfield and now with Super 8. If the coming attraction was wide open, like most movie previews, it would probably have a tagline such as 'If you liked Goonies, Stand by Me or E.T., you'd likeÂ…'Dang; I promised not to spoil too much, like what's already been given away by a lot of viewers and critics. Suffice to say: yes, it's like thoseÂ…and it's set in 1979, so anyone up for a little nostalgia, should see this immediately.I relished in the homage played and the inside jokes for many things, including the 'advanced technology,' just recently defunct, walk-man. But, similar to the 2009 Abrams reboot: Star Trek, the props and feel are just part of the fun and joy.Those were fantastic. This guy KNOWS kids, namely adolescent boys. He had them pegged and the timeframe they were dealing with. This feels extremely like it was made in 1979, but with today's technology. So, I guess I'm saying: it's not only great for nostalgia's sake, it's perfect for those of us who not only grew up in that era, but for those film lovers of the above mentioned films/series.Allow me to go into the plot line, from pretty much the trailer's POV plus a little more that won't spoil too much: several Ohio kids are filming a movie when all of a sudden a train crashes â€“ not just in their presence, but right on top of them andÂ…something escapes. Following that, the town is thrown into turmoil due to lost dogs, appliances and electricity. Toss in the big, bad government/military and intentional confusion and you have another throwback to the 1970's monster movies.It definitely goes beyond that, as it has a lot to do with the film the kids are making, in addition toÂ…well, young love.I really don't want to give away too much more. About the plot that is. What I will comment on is all the other wonderful aspects beyond the fantastic re-creation of an era I grew up in. Such as great cinematography, both depth to the characters and chemistry between them â€“ you'd think they really had known each other since kindergarten and special effects that were not only good, but brought you back to another timeframe: the original Jurassic Park from 1993.Now, the movie's not perfectÂ…the 'creature' that's hidden from audiences that haven't seen this, is really clichÃ©d and not very imaginative. (It really reminded me of much larger 'Species 8472' from Star Trek: Voyager. Wow, that's a double whammy: it dates me in addition to outing me as both a trekker and a Voyager fan. For all of that, I declare: I am not ashamed.) - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_8472Also, it has severe pacing problems and yeah, a lot of it could've been edited out. I'm curious to hear (in the future Bluray's audio commentary) if this was intentional. For, when you go back to movies of our (or could just be my) era, it was pretty much the same thing. It generally took forever to get to the 'goods.' A perfect example is: Superman: The Movie.When I was a kid, the same age as the boys/girl in this movie, I loved Superman II. Why? Because Superman shows up all-but immediately and there's tons of action. And yet, Superman: The Movie is 10x the film the first sequel was even though it takes well over an hour before Kal-El finds his tights.These slow, plot-building/character-developing scenes were common in the 1970s, 1980s and probably before that. Okay, I get that, and I get the yearning to bring us all back. I don't think they needed to go that far.So, I don't think I'll be seeing this again anytime soon â€“ I'm really testy when it comes to slow-moving films that would be better off with a higher speed, even though, I did have a ton of fun during this. The dialogue between the kids wasn't just REAL, but often enormously hilarious. Not to mention the acting/closeness/chemistry from the kids was genuine, namely from lead children Charles (Riley Griffiths â€“ who really channeled the heavier-set kid from the introduction in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade) and lead Joe (Joel Courtney â€“ who is this generation's 'Elliot' from E.T. He not only did a fantastic job here, he literally carried the entire movie with his acting, emotions and facial expressions. If I was a 13-year-old boy again, he would be the one I would both relate and yearn to be the most.)I would highly recommend this fun movie. It does get darker and more violent as the movie progresses â€“ something it doesn't promise in the first half â€“ so, leave the little kids at home. If I were back to these kid's ages, when I absolutely loved films like this, I would probably watch this hundreds of times and love every minute of it, despite my 'grown up' viewpoint nowadays.Side Note: OHÂ…I forgotÂ…Don't forget to stay through 90% of the end credits. I knew to, thanks due a certain movie-review podcast, http://www.fatguysatthemovies.com/. I did see a lot, if not more than two-thirds of the audience, leave before the 'surprise' finale during the end credits. Make sure you stick aroundÂ…if you really had a great time, like I did, it'll be enhanced in the conclusion.",8,1,7,11 June 2011
The Last Samurai," Dances with Swords
","I've worked enough call centers to know their motto: 'Change is Good' isn't really the case; it's just lies to avoid riots. And here's the proof.I wondered how they were going to explain away the once again whitewashing of American movies made in/about foreign countries. This movie is all about Japan's wakeup call to come to the future (of 1870s, anyways) and revolves aroundTom Cruise. Well, he is short. There is thatBut, no need, it was the whole story of him going to Japan in 1876. Once Japan got hit hard with the new technology of the West – or gunpowder, to be precise – the kid Emperor freaked and sought out America's help to evolve. This led to hiring a troubled U.S. Captain (Cruise) to train their armies against the Samurai, or the Japanese equivalent of Native Americans. Or so he thought.Without knowing the background – which I did a little research following this first screening, I knew where this was going: Captain (Cruise) is caught by the Samurai and guess what happens from thereThe Last Samurai is one gorgeously made movieon the surface. Yes, it's Dances with Wolves deep down, but it's what happened to the old ways of Japan. It's both sad, but in some respects, what needed to be done. Now that said, little did we know then, this all eventually triggered Japan's involvement in World War II in the worst possible way.The movie is 100% believable, includes great acting and you do get a sense of what life was like for the Samurai. It's just pretty darn long and a hard sell to get me to see it again since everything that will happen in the movie is so painfully obvious. This is not a good sign since I blindly bought the BluRay movie on good word of mouth and since I needed to fill up my Amazon order to $25 for discounts. I definitely don't regret seeing it. The stunning cinematography alone was worth it. I just probably should've streamed it firsthand since it really is a one-time viewing. On a completely different note, anyone interested in buying a slightly used BluRay copy of The Last Samurai? ***Final thoughts: Notice how I didn't mention Tom Cruise much upstairs. Meaning, I didn't go into his acting, what he brought to the project and if he enhanced it in any way. The last answer is: Nope. He was okay. Good, perhaps, but seriously, anyone could've played his role. The movie's extreme positives come from the story, scenery and direction. Now, I'm not downing Cruise. He is one of my favorites and I've probably seen his movies more times apiece than any other actor. It's just he was incidental to this project. Make that, fourth or fifth tier to the rest.",8,1,2,5 September 2016
Sinister," Sillister
","I made a mistake when I first read the description on IMDb, which has now since changed – ha, of Sinister. The first two words read: 'Found footage' and even though I read the remaining synopsis, my desire to see this was lost on found footage.It also didn't help that I'm not into ghost/haunted house stories, or that I was turned off by the tagline: 'From the Producer of 'Paranormal Activity' and 'Insidious'' – both, of which, I didn't care for or the over-advertisements, as I saw the film's poster all over the place, including the bus stop in front of my office for months.Nevertheless, with the encouragement of some of my on-line friends and the fact that I do like Ethan Hawke, I gave this a shot and I didn't fully regret it.Sure, the movie does provide (some) found footage – so much so, it's the main definition of the term, and it's a ghost story, but the grand substance involves a deep story of a family man's Red Dragon'ish investigation into several 'unrelated' family murders and I always dig that kind of mystery plot.Hawke does hold up, as much as he can, though I feel maybe someone else would've been more active in emotions from all the events. I can't say the same about the cardboard cutouts the actor/actresses who played his family. They weren't just incidental to the actions of head-of-family and writer, Ellison (Hawke,) but their performances were all-but boring and staged.What was interesting was his peering into the murders of several families and subsequence disappearance of one of the children of said families. He lazily uses a far-out Deputy Dewey clone over an easy internet search and somewhat brings his family to the brink of crazy while uncovering the truth.As stated, I'm not a ghost story/haunted house fan, but I'll admit to some actual scares and absolute jumps from me – even when I knew what should be coming. That said, most of the 'shocks' were positively silly, including the laugh-out-loud final frame.Sinister is a mostly well-made film with good cinematography, score, decent twists and genuine scares. Despite its just-above average runtime, you'll desire more time to uncover the mystery Hawke's character is writing about alongside him. And for that, it's a recommendation.",5,1,2,23 November 2012
Up," Up, Up and Away!
","It's getting cliché to say 'the latest Pixar movie is one of the best films of the year' or 'Pixar delivers again!' But, they're now 10-for-10 with 'Up' a brilliantly colorful and original story, filled with heart, adventure, comedy and finally a talking animal that not only explains why he (or they) can talk, but what they would really say vs. the writers humanizing them. Also, the movie opens with a great, yet somewhat slow, monologue explaining the background on the main character, Carl, vs. just telling us he's old and grumpy. At a very young age, Carl befriends an equally adventurous young female and its love-at-first-sight. They marry, but their dreams of Indiana Jones adventure is curbed by everyday life. After she passes, and his neighborhood follows, Carl takes flight, literally, avoiding certain doom in a retirement home. Stowaway Wilderness Explorer 8-year-old Russell helps him try and find Carl's (and late wife's) final destination in South America. Comedy ensues, as the life-lessons-learned and typical sidekicks. Best of the bunch is the aforementioned talking dog, Dug. He was hilarious, interesting and like I said, finally an un-humanized cartoon speaking animal. Okay, now the bad, not that there's much to say negative and this certainly wasn't the weakest, though still way above average, of the Pixar bunch. I saw it in 3-D, and it truly was NOT amazing in 3-D. 'Monsters Vs. Aliens' in IMAX was 10x better in 3-D quality and quality. 'Up' was also incredibly predictable, was funny at times – but not all the time and the trailers gave away too much, gave some background on the boy's father and some woman in his life, but never explored it fully and finally, I seriously can't believe CPS wouldn't be following with all the extreme dangers the child was in.",7,0,6,30 May 2009
A Clockwork Orange," Retribution like Clockwork
","Coming back down from space, though 'supposedly' still in the future, I finished two back to back nights of two back to back Stanley Kubrick films: 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange. And my initial thoughts were: 'Well, at least he's improved, albeit not by the REAL future's The Shining standards'Actually, I can certainly acknowledge this is a well-made film and possibly a little ahead of its time in 1971, but there were just a few areas I just couldn't get past.Such as, by words only, meaning hardly a moment on screen, was this a 'futuristic' society. Yes, I'm aware this is 1971, and possibly filmed prior, and I didn't need to actually see things that didn't exist until decades later: cell phones, laptops, etc. But, almost everything in this movie was that timeframe without a speck of imagination of what the future might hold. For example: Records (yes, including the obvious 2001: A Space Odyssey LP,) landlines, cars, weapons, postersthey're all of the same period as the movie. Oh, I guess you can say medical experiments and blue hair might be considered 'advanced,' but I felt no efforts were made to convince me they thought ahead. (Wait, I guess, hoodlums drink drugs, er, milk, at bars in the future. Yeah.)Opposite the lack of visuals for the so-called 'FUUUUTURE,' were too many mix-matched color or bland schemes on screen. While I am not a Kubrick fan, I absolutely can appreciate his drive, dedication and attention to the smallest of details. Since I know how masterful he is, I was shocked on how unpleasing the movie was to my eyes with the sets, colors, etc. Absolutely, this could've been his intention, and possibly his mark for what the 'bleak' future would bring, so I do claim ignorance in that. But, nevertheless, the movie didn't disturb me in the 'darkness' it should've portrayed; it was distracting on how nothing blended well. So much so, colors and sets reacted like two magnets close together.Finally, given the time, Kubrick at the helm and especially following his finale to 2001: A Space Odyssey, the movie just had to go to odd and out-there psychedelic facial expressions. Of course, this could be interpreted in many, a few or even one right way, but for me, while I was watching both the F. Alexander character's overacting face outside the bathroom and Alex being fed at the end with his mouth opening and digesting food in such a way even a toddler would ridicule him. YesI have an idea why these actors made such drug-induced expressions, but it blended in with my previous point on how unpleasing this was to watch.Now that we're past what personally irked me, I want to again state: I felt this was a well-made movie from all involved and I understand it's been dissected, interpreted, reviewed and acclaimed by many. In fact, many of that group might dislike, discount or flat out say I'm wrong for my view of the movie's shortcomings. Granted, that's everyone's right to an opinion as I am just giving what I witnessed.Since I provided my three negatives, here are my three positives:The story was very well done, classical, even. I loved the point of the journey of Alex and especially the outcome(s). Also, while admiring and enjoying Malcolm McDowell's performance, it was rather hard to see him so young! My Malcolm McDowell that I grew up on was from Star Trek: Generations and more recently, Rob Zombie's Halloween 1 and 2. (Of course, this is not a criticism; it was just weird for me, personally.) And finally, the dialogue was fairly well-done. When I could understand it, that is. Thank God for closed captioning. But, again, that's just me.The movie centers around carefree, selfish, off and criminal(ly insane) 'teenager' (McDowell was 28 at the time of release, so probably 26-27 during filming or so and looked it. In words only, he was a 'teen') Alex, his brethren or 'droogs' and his eventual capture, voluntary rehabilitation and eventually retribution in the most fun, yet unrealistic series of unfortunate events.That one paragraph summed up the entire 136 minutes, but I would encourage people to see all that's involved in this fine movie. It's unapologetic use of the penis – phallic symbolism, rape and torture, both by criminals and government alike, might turn off some people, but I admired how far this director would go to show his vision of what these character's state of mind and surroundings were. Perhaps it was enormously taboo and experimental back 43 years ago, and I'm sure that's one reason it was nominated for best picture.I thought I remembered having seen this roughly 17 years ago and that was the only time. Following the hardest scene for me to watch – the eye-opening scene (and not because of what he was watching on the screen in front of him, but my sensitivity to activity around the human eyes,) I don't recall a single segment. I probably gave up on the movie back then and thus, this is my first ever, full-viewing of A Clockwork Orange.Despite my appreciation of most of this film, it really isn't a movie I'll probably watch again, any time soon, at least. Lord willing, I'm around in another two decades and maybe, I'll revisit the droogs gang with their milk'staches again.",5,1,3,27 April 2013
The Fly," Flyin' High. REAL HIGH.
","People dog remakes all the time. Hell, to begin with, they have little respect for the Horror, Creature-Feature Bmovies of the 40s and 50s. What David Cronenberg did here, with 1986's The Fly wasabsolutely amazing.The original The Fly, the Vincent Price, 1958 movie, of which I haven't seen since I was wee little tyke, had a good-enough idea, but they had to settle for the stated 'Horror, Creature-Feature Bmovies of the 40s and 50s' standards and low-budgetshence, the giant fly-head prop.To a kid, that can, and was to me, be scary. As an adult, or young adult, even, this updated version was just shy of being a horror/suspense/psychological masterpiece in filmmaking and should rank high on anyone's 'Favorite Remakes' list, if not just 'Favorite Horror' tally.The movie wastes no time setting up what seems like a deliciously and wonderful claustrophobic Broadway play with only a trio of main characters and a few minor extras. In the beginning, (the excellently cast) Jeff Goldblum's brilliant scientist, Seth Brundle entices reporter, (also wonderfully cast, Geena Davis's) Veronica back to his 'secret lair' to witness what he refers to: 'something that will change the world, and human life as we know it.' And he's right. Kinda.Even though the original movie predated the Star Trek TV show, the concept Seth's been working on is teleportation; the ability to transport objects, inanimate or not, from one pod/space to another. But, with this technology, it could also help with medical surgeries amongst other fantastic uses.At first, Veronica's skeptical, but eventually she both warms to the idea, the 'story' and, eventually, to Seth. (Side note: they had wonderful chemistry on screen, which is no wonder since they did become a couple for awhile in real life.)But, as all Sci-Fi, Horror stories go, there's the 'but, what if' scene. In a jealous and drunk rage, Seth decides not to wait on tests and becomes the first human teleported. It would've been all okay, if not for that pod swallowing that fly. I guess he'lldie.You (should) know the rest, but not this gruesome and inventive. Director Cronenberg was so incredibly creative and smart, it's a wonder this movie doesn't rank even higher. I am not a prude to when it comes to gross scenes, but some of these scenes when Seth becomes (the fantastically named) BrundleFly, I have to look away.That's not to put a blemish on this great work of art. If anything, it's Cronenberg's way of saying: Hey, this is real lifeif this were to ever happen.And remember, this is 1986 and probably was worked on in 1985. The SMART computers of those days were, well, house-size, almost. It was cool to see such an intelligent computer even way back then.This movie had so many things going for it including, but not limited to: excellent acting, originality even in an old story, chemistry, snappy, believable, rich and often, hilarious dialogue, suspense, horror, drama and a truly satisfying ending. There are a lot of Cronenberg fans out there, but this is BY FAR, my favorite of his tremendous résumé.* * * Final thoughts: 'Be afraid. Be very afraid,' says Geena Davis. You know how many years I took to track down that quote, pre-internet? I had forgotten where it came from and loved it. Well, look no further",10,1,2,4 October 2013
Groundhog Day," What if there was no tomorrow?
","Originally, I wrote a review of 'Groundhog Day' when I was in college, back in 1993, for 'The College Voice' at Glendale Community College in Arizona. I have yet to dig up my published review, so I am going to do this review off a recent viewing on Groundhog Day 2009. What a wonderful movie, dare I say a comedic masterpiece? (Okay, I will, and damned if I will be criticized, but it is still my opinion. Still on top-ten best comedies. So, there.) I believe I have it 5/5 stars back then, and still do. This movie still holds up extremely well, 16 years after originally released. The comedy is still dead on, the emotion and the romantic scenes are also spot on. All the lines were hilarious: 'What if there was no tomorrow? There wasn't one today!' 'That sums it up for me' (and does for me, too, unfortunately) and the long 'I am a god. I'm not thee God' scene was masterful. I love how they never explain how it happens, they just allow the repeated day happen multiple times (no actual count, another great aspect) and have Bill Murray's Phil learn how to be a decent individual. Absolutely holds true, even if were made today. Only difference if it were made today: everyone would have cell phones. And even then, they would play it off as if the cell tower was damaged in the storm. Funny story: after watching the movie again on 2/2/09, I came into work on Tuesday the 3rd, and asked my boss to make sure it was 2/3 and he said it was. I was extremely happy not to have to live the extremely busy (day-after-Super Bowl, 25% work-force call in sick) Monday over and over. It would have been a nightmare.",10,4,8,4 February 2009
Reservoir Dogs," Somewhat Irrelevant
","Well, it was a good start.Actually, let's begin before the start. Way back in the day, I wrote for The College Voice at Glendale Community College. I even had a column named 'Reeves Reviews' and had long hair in my mug shot. (A little after the mug shot was taken, I had cut that mullet I had, but the boys in the newsroom loved it, make that mocked it, so much, they made sure it stayed in my column.) One enormously unpopular review I wrote was for Reservoir Dogs. It probably would've been criticized elsewhere, but namely it was trashed on a 'college' campus. I gave it 1/5 stars and named it 'irrelevant.' (Reprinted article follows this review.) Since this was not only Quentin Tarantino's debut film, neither me, nor the movie watching audience had any scope of what Tarantino was capable of. After watching his future directed projects, such as his enormously improved second outing, Pulp Fiction, I strongly say again: this was a good start.Reservoir Dogs starts off well, with a soon-to-be signature rotating camera view of a cast of off-beats discussing highly irrelevant topics, in this case: Madonna songs and an awesome anti-tipping monologue. But after the strong and fun opening, the movie moves on to the real story. These men, cleverly named (mostly) after colors (Pink, Brown, White, Orange, Blonde, Blue, Nice Guy and, uh, Joe) attempt a heist which, of course, gets botched and one of them is no longer a color but a rodent, or rat, to the police.The film, in (again) soon-to-be classic Tarantino fashion, is told in multiple flashbacks and decisively never actually shows the jewelry robbery, which I liked. In fact, the majority, if not 99% of the film plays out like a theatre production and gives the movie time to breath with great dialogue.Granted, the movie is hard to watch, and I am not just referring to those so lost when a movie's not shown in chronological order. It's hard due to the excessive violence, blood, torture, language and being almost completely void of any characters to root for. These men are bad, very bad and I am guessing this is the message Tarantino wants to get across: this is a movie about bad, very bad guys. It's not a nice cop/western show where the good guys wear white and you applaud them on.Recently, I began re-watching all of Tarantino's directorial flicks, mostly in reverse order, of which, I finished here, with Reservoir Dogs. If you happen to watch them that way, it's easy to see how great and definitively quickly he grew to what I strongly believe to be one of the best directors to live. But, therein lies the problem I had with Reservoir Dogs and this has nothing to do with the original review I had with this movie. (By the way, I did upgrade my rating - slightly, but it did take a few additional movies of him for me to, well, 'get him' – my bad, and it did take more than one viewing of this film, as well.) This film had a lot of what Tarantino wanted to say, to do, with rich dialogue, interesting characters with absolute depth, and film, comic, music and pop references, but it really didn't allow Tarantino to really take it to the next level, or what Pulp Fiction did.So, don't do what I did, unless you have seen his entire directorial collection. Watch them in order, starting with this one and ending with (so far) Inglourious Basterds. Sure, you might still like/love this one, but, you'll soon love to explore the depths he takes his talent, both on screen, behind the camera and in the scripts. And here is my original review written in late 1992 for The College Voice. By the way, I've since lighted a lot of the subject of homophobic lines and characters in movies. Unless it's blatantly against and rallies people to burn gays, I rarely even bring it up. In addition, I remember specifically those guys in the newsroom, the same ones who thought it was fun to make light of my mullet, were ready to kill me for my opinion on this. I get that a lot.'Dark humor and violence dog irrelevant 'Reservoir''A confused film usually can't tell if it wants to be a comedy, drama or a speak-out-against-society film.'Reservoir Dogs' is a movie in that category, and it's more a black comedy than anything else.Somewhat funny at times, 'Reservoir Dogs' is not an interesting film. It's too much of a confused and angry movie, lashing out against law enforcement, homosexuals and African-Americans.The film's weak plot begins in a diner with six or seven gentlemen, and an array of obnoxious, annoying criminals who sit and talk about today's lighted topics, including Madonna.After the diner scene, which is the best part of the entire film, they switch to the events that take place after the crime, which they were hired to commit.Violent, gory scenes follow as 'Orange,' (Tim Roth) a criminal, has been shot and is quickly dying due to loss of blood. 'White,' (Harvey Keitel) his partner in crime, takes him to their 'hide-out,' an empty warehouse, in fear the police will find out who they are.The story line suggests a strong hatred for police officers. It even shows one of the men bringing in a police officer to question why the police showed up so quickly after the robbery.Later, this officer is brutally tortured. It is obvious to see debut-director Quentin Tarantino's respect for law enforcement.The profanity and violence in the film makes it realistic, but at most times, it's irrelevant. 'Reservoir Dogs' receives one out of five stars on my film rating scale. This film should be avoided.",5,0,1,6 January 2010
How to Train Your Dragon," Too Bad the Story Was Dragon
","Let's get the positive out first, for a first. I LOVED the graphics in How to Train Your Dragon. In a lot of ways, even though it was animated, it was thoroughly more believable than the similar Avatar.Yep, I said positive, as in singular, not that the movie was bad, or was dragon (ha, uh, never mind) but the story was so incredibly basic, clichéd, predictable and overdone that even though it might have had 'heart' at its core, I was so overwhelmed with the same'ole'same'old'stuff that I couldn't get into the characters. It probably doesn't help that I CANNOT STAND Jay Baruchel. Even his voice. And he's the main character, Hiccup.I've been told this is geared towards kids. Yeah, blah, blah, I know, but in the age of Pixar, or heck, the last of the great Disney Dynasty films: The Little Mermaid, Beauty & the Beast, Aladdin or The Lion King, there is NO excuse for not having a great, even mesmerizing script. And because of the weak screenplay, it shares more qualities with Avatar than just dragons(-like creatures.)Like I reported: the graphics were amazing and brought you into their fantasy world. But so did Wall-E, and tell me which one was better when it came to having both cool effects in conjunction with a great story?AnyhooHiccup is the weakest link in the village'o'vikings who battle dragons on a daily basis and being the son of the leader of the pack, Stoick (Butler) he has to prove himself. But, surprise, he can't when he does land one of the rarest of dragon breeds. Another surprise – if the title doesn't give it away – is that he both befriends and aids the recovery of the dragon when his tail was cut. Further surprise occurs when he learns they're not the threat his town folk fear and he becomes affectionate with Toothless, the dragon.I'm having trouble coming up with more words that would precede 'surprise' so let's sum up the rest: a girl he likes becomes suspicious, he must lie to protect both himself and his 'pet/friend' and the finale's seen a mile away if you already knew the above after pretty much just the first surprise/spoiler's revealed.I will say, the one 'twist' they put on this century's old plot, was the dragon's motivations. I admit I liked that, but it wasn't enough to mask the other 95 minutes of predictability.The REAL story here, and why I am recommending this, is the cinematography. The movie's beautiful and extremely well crafted. I've suggested leave-your-brain-at-the-door movies before, so I will here because otherwise you'll miss out on the beauty of this film. That said, I won't be rushing to see the inevitable sequel, but I'm glad I experienced this cinematic experience.",5,5,18,8 January 2011
Total Recall," Rekall the Better Version
","Once, when I was little boy, or 16, I ate up every movie I could in the theatres. Anything, everything. I studied films, read about them, watched as many trailers as I could and went to them all week long. And this was all pre-internet, so the research was limited to, well, real research.Oddly, one completely escaped my radar: 1990's Total Recall. In fact, three weeks prior to release, I had never heard of it. Just saw a mostly black, movie teaser poster with a triangle on it. Later, I would discover it was a pyramid. Two weeks prior to opening, they inserted the SCHWARZENEGGER name on the same poster. I was excited, and then realized this would be a perfect opportunity to go into a movie cold for once. Within the final week beforehand, they just added the name of the movie to the poster. But, at that point, I was already hooked.I remember this like it was yesterday. On opening day, Friday, June 1, 1990, I sat in AMC Metro Theatres for the very first screening, the 10AM showing, completely opened minded and gleefully ignorant to anything I was about to see, other than what appears might be a Sci-Fi Schwarzenegger flick. I was stoked and on the edge of my seat before the movie began.By film's end, I was so pumped up, so excited, and so happy. The movie was 100% everything I wanted out of both an action and Schwarzenegger film. And it made me, to this day, love the feeling of going in completely blind.Now, with today's world – i.e. the internet and, of course, Facebook – that's harder and harder to do. Nevertheless, if I get a tiny bit of interest in a big project, especially something I'm fond of already, i.e. Superman, I try my best to avoid all conversations, reviews, comments and absolutely spoilers.I digress. This FIRST and BEST version of Total Recall, based on the Philip K. Dick's too-long title, We Can Remember It For You Wholesale, is an almost 100% action packed Sci-Fi adventure of a not-so-ordinarily-built construction worker, Douglas Quaid (Schwarzenegger,) who, after a trip to the mind-altering Rekall Inc. place of the future, sets in motion a series of spy antics and leads him to Mars. There, he needs to regain his memory, save that planet and get the girl. You know, the usual.I've been told, since I haven't read Dick's short story, that the updated 2012 version is more accurate to the book than this 1990 version. Who cares? This one was ten times more fun, so incredibly 90s – a plus for me and the ideal summer blockbuster. Also Schwarzenegger in his prime! (But, of course, we didn't know any different back then.) Not all movies based on (short or not) books are better if they're word-for-word the original source material.Stanley Kubrick's 1980 adaptation of The Shining was very loosely based on the Stephen King book I read. That was okay by me. The movie was a near-masterpiece in film making. I like to say: I enjoyed both versions, Kubrick's and King's. Later, the TV-miniseries, The Shining was almost identical to King's version and itsucked.And in 1993, I literally – dead serious here – finished the book, The Firm, while in line waiting for the sneak preview of the film based on the John Grisham novel. (I started the very long book 6 days prior, and even though I'm a slow reader, I did everything I could to get it done by the film's premiere. I barely accomplished that while in line!) Following the movie, I was very disappointed because they changed so much, including tone and how the incredibly smart the (book) character, Mitch McDeere, was now dumbed down in the film.My opinion all changed for The Firm when I saw the follow-up movie: The Pelican Brief, which I also read. It was almost verbatim the book. So, during that movie, I knew exactly what was going to happen and when and that was no fun. (The Client followed suit, as well.)Point is, even when a book is masterful, that doesn't mean a director/screenplay writer can't take it to a new level, while playing respectful homage to the original writer and characters. Total Recall took the simple idea, or synopsis printed above, and ran with it on another planet. It was fun, exciting, funny, thrilling, suspenseful, had a great score and great graphics. Sure some things are a bit out of date, but then, that's what they thought in 1990.Despite some minor 'futuristic' funnies, Director Verhoeven (who's becoming one of my favorite directors, if not just for that time period) gave me a thrill of a popcorn movie that holds up strongly today. Skip the 2012 version; stick with the original. Well, sorta.Side Note and Spoiler – fair warned: It's not an implant. The movie's events were real. There's enough evidence throughout, from the looks that both his 'wife' Lori (Stone) and friend/coworker, Harry (Robert Costanzo,) gave Quaid prior to his visit to Rekall to the Rekall people stating they keep up with 'today's times' and that's why they would have a video picture of Quaid's girl, it's all real. I understand Verhoeven likes those open-ended, discussion-educing finales, but I believe this was all true.Side Note II: Since I've seen this, and it's been many years ago, I've become quite the Star Trek: Voyager lover. In this movie, the automated cab driver's voice instantly told me he was dubbed by Voyager's Doctor, played by Robert Picardo. I was right. Yata! Still, love that man.",9,0,2,21 July 2013
Sicario," The Silence of the Mules
","Maybe the reason Sicario didn't do so well at the box office or nominated for more deserved Oscars, such as Best Screenplay, Acting and definitely, Picture, was because of how bad the title is. I can barely pronounce it, unless I look at it, or even remember the title. In fact, when I went to go to recommend this at work today to my friends after seeing it for the first time last night, I had to Google it each time.I get what the word means: hired assassin, and it does, very appropriately, fit into the movie. But, that doesn't stop it from failing to get the great word of mouth it truly deserves. I mean, c'mon people; this is a great movie!From moment one, the movie looks gorgeous. It's so beautifully and carefully shot, it better win one of the (only, gasp!) three awards it was nominated for: Best Cinematography. What further grabbed me was the story began in Chandler, Arizona, a Phoenix suburb close to where I work, of all places, and not the obvious choice of Arizona's largest city and capital, Phoenix, itself. That's so cool.Beyond the location and immediate intrigue – this movie wastes no time getting into an extremely interesting story, the high quality acting and direction are immediately present. Emily Blunt blasts onto the screen with a character and acting ability that makes us quickly emerge into her world. Blunt's FBI agent, Kate Macer, is recruited by some incredibly confident 'secret government agents' that convince her she'll be helping them catch the drug lord(s) who are terrorizing her home of Phoenix (and suburbs) especially after the location mentioned above – a Chandler, Arizona home – practically blows up with a trap set by the drug bad guys.Not without a conscience, Kate is baffled on how the real war on drugs is fought and alongside her even more suspicious partner, she questions and attempts to do the right things to get convictions and build cases against the czars while her new leaders pretty much act all Jack Bauer in Mexico and here against the baddies.There's more, much more, as this onion gets pealed, and I'll leave all that up to you to see for yourself. As you should. In fact, go seek out this movie now and see the greatness for yourself. This movie is absolutely intense and raises so many ethical questions. It's easy, and common, for me to say, YES, do law by the book. Heck, I even have previously built a case against the vigilante, The Batman, on how he always breaks the law every time he leaves the Bat-Cave. But, all the way through this, and seeing the grotesque scenes in Mexico, I found myself sometimes siding with the 'Super-cops' Kate is internally battling and at other times, agreeing with Kate's morals. Now, without giving away the ending, but keeping with the same point, I have to wonder if I chose the right side. That said, or not said I guess, I LOVED the ending. Even though the movie is fiction, we're usually left with the twist and ironic ending. No, I don't usually like those, but generally respect the writers for doing what they thought right. THIS was how I wanted it to end and made it all the more enjoyable.Definitely should've used a different title. I bet that would've gotten the word out more and more people would've seen such great efforts all around.***Final thoughts: My friend and professional movie critic named this as his favorite movie of 2015 and called it the horror police procedural 'The Silence of the Lambs' (summing up his words.) Well, like I stated above for the title, I've never heard of it, but taking both his word on the best of 2015 and him comparing it to my favorite movie of all time, The Silence of the Lambs, I had to see it. And yeah, it was kinda like The Silence of the Lambs. Totally can see that. So, thank you, Kevin. Glad I finally listened to you.",9,0,2,17 February 2016
Pretty Woman," She Had Me Hooked
","'Fifty bucks, Grandpa. For seventy-five, the wife can watch.' - KitI could write this review in the dark. I've seen Pretty Woman so many times, I cannot count. I take that back: I can count how many timesI saw it in the theatre.Back in Summer 1990 – yes, months after this opened, I saw it for the first time, in an empty theatre, during an afternoon weekday. I didn't want to see it, but everyone including my beloved Aunt recommended it over and over. And over. And over. So, I caved.Six more viewings, including the last 2 on the same day, and I have had a record for me for one single movie unbroken since 1990. Yes, I saw Pretty Woman 7 times in the movie theatres. Obviously, I loved it back then. And still do. It's always like an old friend when I revisit this, albeit, one I can quote word for word, but still.Granted the movie's one singular flaw is that it's not the most original concept. For that, on my personal scientific scale of rating movies, it lost one single point bringing the overall score to 99/100. Rarely, on my list, will any movie even get above 95/100, let alone 99/100and only one got to 100/100. So, when I even state the word 'flaw,' I mean in the absolute smallest of ways. And besides, they address this with that one funny line: 'What, you want me to name someone? You want like a name? Oh, God, the pressure of a name... I got it. Cindafuckin'rella!' – Kit Actually, come to think of it, there's dozens of funny lines, motions, scenes. I laugh as hard as I cry during each viewing. This movie is absolutely brilliant from beginning to end with its perfect balance of drama, comedy and romance.Emotionally beaten down Vivian (Julia Roberts – in a role that propelled her into space) had just recently begun streetwalking when she's picked up, initially for directions, by über-rich Edward Lewis (Richard Gere in a masterful performance) on Hollywood Boulevard. When it's realized she's a hooker with a heart and he's a hopeless romantic, they slowly begin a relationship, despite her being requested, um paid, to be at his 'beck and call' for the remainder of his business trip in L.A.Of course, things are going to get complicated as roles are defined, and others have been thrown into the mix, but these two actors were so incredibly believable, so real and had so many genuine reactions and improved lines/scenes, you will fall hard for their romance.I've wanted to write this review of one of my all time favorite movies for quite some time. Sadly, I do not think, even with the countless (home) viewings, that I will do this movie justice. I will just say what's on my mind, and always on my mind when I see this:Fantastic lines, great pacing, deep romance, believable faces, one of the best soundtracks ever, also great score, real and fun. From beginning to end, I get involved and not just because I've seen it before; it's just a journey I love to get involved in and always pretend it's my first time. So much so, that I literally smile wide (like the absolutely stunning Roberts in this) when a scene comes up I didn't allow myself to recall.This has been, is and always will be one of my all-time favorite movies. It thoroughly improved on the old Cinderella story one-hundred times. And this version is absolutely timeless.Side Note: As mentioned above, I've seen this movie 7 times in the theatre and the last 2 of those, on the same day. Just to explain, I had the day off of school, and was to meet my friends at the now-defunct Valley West Mall's dollar theatre. Actually, it was Tuesday's 50 cent day. So, while waiting on my friends, who did not have the day off, I decided on seeing Pretty Woman for the sixth and final time during the early afternoon. Little did I know, they, too, wanted to see it, so I went to go with them to the same theatre screen, the same day, to see Pretty Woman a seventh time.Side Note II: Since I am a huge Superman fan, I wanted to break this 7x in the theatre record in 2006 with Superman Returns. Sadly, as much as I liked that movie (and wanted to more) I could only make it to 5 viewings. Here's to 2013's Man of Steel. I am going to try and break the record once more!",10,0,2,28 April 2013
Pulp Fiction," I didn't go into Burger King.
","'Zed's dead, baby. Zed's dead.' Pulp Fiction has to be one of the best crafted movies of all time. Sure, it's out of order and some people (including some dear to me) got confused, but it's so well made in the sections it's presented, it deserves to be on the top of all people's best of lists.Yeah, it contains violence and a lot of it. Some language and it's excessive. And believe it or not, for being a 'guy's movie' it contains full frontal male-nudity (thanks, Bruce.) But, it's creative, inventive, original and a helluva lot of fun.There's a dozen or more subplots to explore, but for the most part, it involves the zany adventures of Vincent (Travolta) and Jules (Jackson.) They're enlightened hit men or simply, employees of one Marsellus (Rhames) and they're on a mission to retrieve a golden briefcase. In the interim, they accidentally shoot someone, get shot or dance off with a drug addict.To be perfectly honest, despite the previous paragraph's spoilers, there's so much going on in this movie, it's hard to describe everything that happens. Needless to say, you MUST see this movie.It contains the following: excellent acting, great comebacks/tributes (Travolta and Stoltz amongst others,) wonderful dialogue, comedy, cinematography, soundtrack, score, originality and enormous breakthrough for a director/writer (Tarantino) who is likely to go down as one of the best directors/writers of all time.I have practically memorized the soundtrack and quotes. And even the joke involving tomatoes. It's rich and deserves an audience from the 1990s to present. Perhaps Tarantino didn't know what impact he would have with his 'fictional' story. But anyone that's seen this knows what a master he was when he created this world.I have no problem for saying the following words: Alfred Hitchcock is a favorite of mine. Tarantino is drawing very near to the master Hitchcock was. As crazy as Tarantino may appear, he knows what he wants, he knows how to spin an extremely creative yarn and he doesn't seem to care if anyone else agrees. To me, I hold him in the highest respect for his visions.",9,2,5,30 December 2009
Jack Reacher," Definitely a Reach
","Jack Reacher was a fantasy. Barely would it ever happen, so why not have fun in its fictional tale?Half the movie, we have super-soldier, Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) in charge and smarter than the average bear. The other half, he has no idea what he's doing, getting himself into or a match for what he's opposing. Had they been consistent with Jack's methods, I might have been onboard with his plight. Sadly, they seemed to not know what kind of man this was and this translated in an unsympathetic audience.Basically, Invisible Ultra-Ex-Soldier Jack is called back into the spotlight when a sniper takes out citizens in front of the Pirate's PNC Park in Pittsburgh, PA. (That's a lot of P's.) He's being summoned to investigate the so-called close'n'shut case against the shooter. And the defense attorney's career/life might be in question. Will they find the truth? Will Jack clear his name once accused? Will there be a sequel, like the novel series this is based on?No. To the sequel question. This movie did not make the box office equivalent to necessitate a follow-up film. In good faith, I agree. While entertaining and somewhat interesting, it wasn't great or even really that good. Maybe the books are better, but sadly, I saw very little of substance in this character of Jack Reacher.Now, I am a huge Tom Cruise supporter, despite a lot of people's objection to him and his old couch-jumpin' days. But, since the script was unfocused and the title character was written so badly – He's strong! He's weak! He's confused! He's on top of it! And so on! – I can't see another JR movie any time soon.",4,0,3,8 September 2013
Les Misérables," Oui, Miserable
","Picture it: Tempe, Arizona, 2002. I first got my glimpse into the play version of Les Misérables with my partner at ASU, the only time I've ever been (and since) on that campus. Honestly, I liked the experience of going to such an acclaimed production, but aside from one song/scene, I really didn't like it.Nothing's changed, more than a decade later: I still love that one song and I disliked the rest of the film.Let's get that positive out of the way. On My Own was an incredible song even when it was sung by one of the third-tier and almost irrelevant characters who shows up abruptly and leaves just as suddenly. To this day, this song breaks my heart and yeah, there's a big reason why – not to be revealed here. Regardless, it's absolutely not worth putting yourself through the rest of the incredibly bad soundtrack Les Misérables presents.There. I said it. Les Misérables is a terrible musical and contains the worst music I've heard in any musical, with the exception, of course, of On My Own. And if you like this type of 'music,' great, because for far too long screen time, they just sing words, mostly overlapping with no rhythm.Oh, and while the story is moving, for a few moments of the 157 minutes, it just rambles on and jumps too many times to really get the feel of the characters. How many times can you say 8 years later without ever having anything interesting happening in between or these characters continue to live?Slave, or so they say because he's really a prisoner, nobody Jean Valjean is 'released,' sort of, for stealing bread, but when he breaks parole, he's is incredibly and unbelievably hunted by one policemanfor decades. (Sure, it was a different time, and yeah, in all eras people get obsessed, but c'mon now.)So, get past that, and join the time-spanning journey of a man who says he's just, but then steals from the only one who wants to help, but then turns good. While sort of saving one female, he makes it his mission to care for her youth when she passes, abruptly.Meanwhile, while Jack McGee is hunting this hulk'ing singer, a revolution happens and a boy out of nowhere is now Jean's son, sorta. And then when one character is shown true mercy – oh, I don't know for the fifteenth time, and finally gets it and learns to reciprocate, he decides it's best to take this life lessonimmediately to the grave. Huh?Yeah, I know the story, and yeah, I'm mocking it by not giving the true movie synopsis – I did see the movie (and play) after all, but as the days pass since I watched this story again, I've had a bad taste in my mouth since. Sure, the production values, sets and cinematography were well done, but the songs, story and pacing alldon't shoot...sucked!Okay, I'm in the minority on this one, but damn, people. Don't just follow the large posters because they show a little girl with messed up hair who only appears in the movie for an all-but split second. It's over-hyped and over-long. Skip it!",2,5,11,17 January 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Unicron Returns!
","Scream 2 made it a point to point out part 2s don't hold a candle to the originals. 1997's Scream 2 was 2 decades before its time.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 seemed like a love letter to fans. Give 'em what they loved in the first one and up the budget. This was a sequel movie trope since the 80s and more so in the 90s. And this movie was broken into quarters, as one disposable character in this movie points out are not thirds of the movie. Let me preface that I LOOOVED the first Guardians of the Galaxy. Seen it multiple times and is one of my all-time favorite Marvel, Comic Book and Origin Story movies. Sowhat a let down here.Back to quarters. The first half of this movie was just fan-fare. Giving the audience what they loved about part one without much new substance or heart the first one had in spades. Then, the 3rd quarter picks up and makes my heart soar and I loved every minute of that third quarter. Annnd, we're back to the never-ending fourth and not-so final quarter since there were far-too-many post credit scenes I simply lost interest with each one. While I didn't hate the first half or the never-ending last quarter as they both contained some decent scenes and hearty laughs, it was that wonderful third quarter that makes me grant a slight recommendation for this entire movie.Basically, the gang's back and they're saving one clone army of batteries and causing another conflict that eventually lands our beloved Guardians of the Galaxy apart for most of the film. Oooooof course, they only work together well as a team and it takes the majority of the movie and our patience to get that.Gone was the heart of the original. Vanished were the unforgettable songs. Out were the stakes. And Mini-Groot was absolutely more annoying than cute and hell, did I miss the big, funny and heartfelt Groot from the first one. This felt rushed and if not for some comedy throughout, good FX and, again, that third quarter, this wouldn't get the slightest of recommendations. In fact, as stated, I've seen the first multiple times. I might never see this one again, if not for the inevitable Vol. 3 where I might do a little Guardians marathon. Hopefully, enough time has passed by then and I'll have a little heart for this entry. But, until Vol. 3, I'd skip this movie and just do a marathon then. Hopefully, they'll get back on track with that chapter.***Final thoughts: Just a clarification and in defense of this project, outside that now infamous third quarter, I did LOVE the Rocket vs. the Dozens of Henchmen in the forest scene. THAT was so awesome and is worth an extra ½ star for that scene alone.",4,3,7,8 August 2017
Titanic," Ready to go Back to Titanic
","When James Cameron staple, Bill Paxton, uttered the words: 'Are you ready to go back to Titanic?' I hadn't actually been sure as of late. For, I've seen it three times in the theatres back in 97/98 and maybe once more on VHS a year or two later. I've had the score and 'song' memorized since and, of course, I knew the outcome.Well, when the movie opened, I felt more than ready. Gone were the thoughts: 'Be prepared, this is three plus hours' and I was once again mesmerized from minute one all the way until minute 194. This near-masterpiece made me miss how movies are supposed to made: with heart and talent. And that year, plenty were: some of other best picture nominations, L.A. Confidential, Good Will Hunting, and As Good as it Gets, were also utterly fantastic. Sadly, since 1997, we're lucky to have ONE made with such heart and incredible talent per year.By now, everyone knows the story and has since copied it multiple times. Let me make this clear: VERY few have made one with such a great script with believable dialogue, excellent actors and above all-else, chemistry. Kate and Leo had it in spades. From the second Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) looked up when new-friend, Tommy (Jason Barry) was talking to him, and saw Rose (Kate Winslet,) I KNEW they captured true love.Since this movie arrived 15 years ago, I've been a pretty good fan of Kate, but not so much Leo. He suffers from Denzelitis whereas almost every role he performs, he's not trying to act; he's JUST trying to win an Oscar. This annoying habit leads to way too much over-acting and an abundance of screaming. (SEE: practically any Leo or Denzel Washington role since 1997.)But...Leo pulled it off here. Truly, he showed such a deep affection, love and purity towards his costar that I believed every word, every action and that Rose's heart will go on. He did it so well, with each viewing, I always envisioned her life, the rest of it from the Titanic sinking until her death with him in her heart.These two, Rose and Jack amongst a few other decent characters, namely the fantastic Kathy Bates as The Unsinkable Molly Brown, were so good and deep that I never mind that it's about an hour and a half or more before the 'special effects' kick in. I.E. The ship sinks. (Oops, sorry, spoiler.)That's the genius of James Cameron. His heart and soul was in this project. He nearly bankrupted the studio and himself and practically gave himself a bad name prior to opening â€“ which was rescheduled more than once. He didn't just make an hour and half retelling of a sinking ship, even though he had the technology. And he didn't just put two romantic leads together; he made sure that the fictional love backdrop was as real as the amazing sinkage.To give an example of an 'epic' retelling following Titanic that did not have the qualities needed to further an 'opening buildup' of a romance is Peter Jackson's King Kong. It was flat, boring and unconvincing. He sure had the talent â€“ Kong looked real, but sadly that CGI character held the most depth in the movie.Beyond the romance â€“ that, yes, made me tear again after all these years/viewings and only because I believed the true love before me, was the ultimate score, one of the best songs, movie hit or not, excellent dialogue spoken â€“ mostly by Leo and Molly Brown, great special effects and breathtaking cinematography. I had to see this on the big screen again, although I would've MOST preferred to have the option of 2-D.I would love to see a new movie of such deep quality and soul like this spend a deserved 15-weeks at number one at the box office that I would strongly stand behind. Recently, The Hunger Games did a decent four weeks at number one, and the highly inferior to both movies, Avatar, did seven. But both were just simple blockbusters. Not heart-felt movies. Not movies I would rate 5/5 stars â€“ my highest honor of reviews.Sadly, James Cameron's follow-up, the Space Gully with Wolves film, Avatar, brought down Titanic's mind-blowing record box-office receipts. Oh, how I wished with the 2012 re-release with the 'ho-hum' 3-D format would've have reclaimed the top spot. But it isn't to happen. And that's okay. It's still a great movie, still holds up today, still makes me laugh and cry and still makes me feel love all over again for movie making. If you are one of the six people in the world that hasn't seen it, SEE TITANIC.Side Note: Way back in the day, when internet was really just kick starting and we had things like 'I.M.'ing' each other, I was involved in a long-distance relationship and I actually typed out CÃ©line Dion's song, My Heart Will Go On to my partner that thoroughly made him blush.Side Note II: As stated, I watched this three times in the theatre following its initial release. On the last turn, I was on a first date with a guy â€“ against all warnings from my friends to make Titanic a 'first date' movie. Well, it did turn out to be the first and last date. This was his first viewing of Titanic and still, he fell asleep around hour one and awoke right before (spoiler!) Jack dies. I know my date was awoken because his snores stopped and he instantly began weeping. Frustrated, I said in a normal voice, despite being in the theatre, 'What do you have to be crying about? You don't even know these characters!' Yep, that was the last I saw of him.",10,3,5,3 March 2013
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Harry Potter's Philosopher's Sorcerer's Drawl
","First off, I am going to give my modern day thoughts on Harry Potter and the Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone since I just now watched it for the first time in about 10½ years. And then, I will tell my story. I will begin with the positives to be nice. To be generous.80% of the special effects and sets worked extremely well with the exception of showing both The Man With No Nose – oops, I'm jumping ahead, I mean: The Man's Name They Only Speak Of Seldomly and ANY flying sequence including that Rubbish, er, I mean Quidditch game. Also, the film was a perfect fantasy for youngVERY YOUNG, that is, kids. Oh, and the score was unbelievably great.Whew. Got that out of the way. Okay, here goes: the movie was too damn long. The movie contained a minuscule amount of plot – or direction and the bulk was just spliced together scenes of a freshman year at a unique school. Quite frankly, it felt like 1,001 ideas and made up names (for useless characters, random spells, odd or clichéd wizardry creatures and places) were basically thrown at us while hero Wesley Crusher, a.k.a. Harry Potter, attempts to figure out what the whole point to this mess is.What started off very nicely in a fantasy and magic-filled-world slowly grinded to a halt so they could show off more fantastic sets and a zillion characters and objects in a school bent on kidnapping kids to learn sorcery. Eventually, it takes about an hour and forty-five minutes or roughly fifteen minutes past what this movie should've been clocked at, to learn what our 'hero' (??) Harry Potter should accomplish before the credits roll.By that point, I kept repeating two phrases over and over: 'I don't like this movie' (despite the graphics and the wonder it's showing me) and that this is really made for the five and under crowds. Further, when the movie finally did get past the climax of what Harry & Pals (including his poor idiot ginger chap and know-it-all-bitch with terrible hair) need to accomplishthere are FIVE endings. This movie would never, ever, ever, ever end.Oh, and before the judgments roll in, I *have* read the book. Book one, that is. I found it's all-but exactly, word-for-word as the adaption. And that's not necessarily a good thing. Despite its approximately 300 pages, enormously large print, wide margins and drawings – all of which would make it approximately 3 chapters of any normal Stephen King fare – it's just as plot less as the movie until the end. All the way through both the book and movie, I kept fantasying about other movies/books I could be entertained by that contained a point to the story from beginning to end.Now, that all said, it's not a terrible movie. It's a good intro to what's to come and again, it's PERFECT for very young kids. Is it a movie I will ever revisit, or as now, re-watch in another 11 years? Hell no. Now, that I can finally write a review, I never have to experience Harry's seemingly never-ending freshman year at Hogwart's school.And now here's my take on my original screeningA Long Time Agoin our own galaxy, sort of, I watched Harry Potter Part One – since it's known by two different names, for asinine reasons, I will refer this as 'Part One' – only due to a babysitting gig I was coaxed into. I had already made up my mind not to see this film, since swords/wizards/fantasy isn't my cup of British TeaBut, since I had seven hours of babysitting two young boys, I thought: why not take up an hour and a half on a movie they'll probably want to see?That was mistake one and two: forgoing my vow and that I mistakenly thought it would be an hour and a half. Mistake number three was that we went on weekend one or two – I can't recall, or I choose not to – so, the theatres and parking lot were still jammed. We barely made our show time after parking and getting snacks.Despite being tortured (SEE ABOVE REVIEW) for the movie's duration, I was pleased I had just used up 5 of the 7 babysitting hours with the journey there, movie and back. As for the boysboy, they LOVED the movie. They LITERALLY sat on the edge of their seats the entire time. (No joke.) Good for them. I'm glad the money I spent on their entertainment and their snacks was well worth it.I, on the other hand, was squirming in my seat the entire time or at least after the first pointless hour. I had NO IDEA that this was over an hour and a half, let alone 2½+ hours – I was so disinterested in seeing this, I had completed no research. NO KID MOVIE SHOULD EVER BE THAT LONG – I originally thought. Not to mention, no kids movie should contain FIVE ENDINGSas stated above: the movie would never, ever end.Again, I remember the boys, one of which is my (now 15-year-old) nephew, loved every single minute and as uncomfortable as I was, I'm sincerely glad they had a good time. In fact, I need to make a point of asking him if he remembers me taking him. He had to be between 4-5 at the timeA year later, I would be dragged into seeing the remake/sequel with my partner and suffice to sayI could write the same damn review all over again.(Editor's Note: I decided to listen to the masses for this Harry POTter phenomena and revisit the series. I've only seen the first two, both once and in first run theatres. Since it's been around a decade since the initial releases, I've started over with #1 and will get to what everyone calls: the better years.)",3,5,11,3 March 2013
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," The Harry Games
","Mercifully, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire fixed the error made in the previous feature: they remembered to include an exciting, action packed and door-opening finale. Sadly, they just had to sacrifice the first two-thirds to get to that good conclusion.So frustrated, I am. I've listened to the fans, to my social circle and to my social media friends. And I've been warned that these movies are made for fans and you MUST HAVE READ THE BOOKS to follow the movies. Hogwash! This is a separate medium and should be treated as such. It should have the elements of the book, but understand there could – and is – a new audience out there.I'm losing this battle and fast. Even more random scenes cloud this enormously rough entry in the series. In fact the movie is so far all over the place, with ideas, characters, scenes, names, legends, games, grudges it all seems like: YES, YOU NEED TO READ THE BOOK TO CONTINUE.Well, since I won't read them, after I finished book one, I might be in more trouble as the series progresses. Sadly, I feel my ratings will decrease because I do not feel the writers/directors are going to do the right thing. No lost soul should enter a Christian Church for the first time and be greeted with 'So, why are you lost? Have you not read what Christ has done for you? Buffoon! Get out and come back when you read the Bible cover to cover. I don't have time for you.'At any rate, with a surprisingly new opening – i.e. gone are the abusive adopted parents and the vicious warning Harry ignores of his pending death – that involves a kind of game, I guess, that will make someone – wait for it – victorious. Obviously, Harry will be involved, by his own doing or not, though the way the game's played out is less foretold. Including, the three-part game that apparently is spread aimlessly thorough the year. ??That's the basic synopsis of a film that wanders from here to there, that holds one door open while reaching for the next, that fast forwards teen adolescent, love lost, gained, anger, betrayal, redemption, secrets, etc, etc, etc, and so on and so forth. I get the fact that these are excellent elements to make a good story, but you don't have to use half a dictionary to make one sentence. Pick a direction, a path and have the conviction to stick to it. Here are some additional thoughts I had while trying to wade through this mess: <ul><li>I'm actually finding myself caring less and less for these side characters. YES, its Harry's story and journey, but his annoying counterparts could meet their doom by series end and I wouldn't bat an eye.</li></ul><ul><li>Ron's bipolar and it's getting increasingly tedious. He's acting hurt, upset, okay, angry, jealous, etc, etc and all the while he's sporting a 1970's Leif Garrett hairdo that's more distracting – and awful – than anything else.</li></ul><ul><li>The first three movies, aside from a few key elements, are essentially the same film and should've served as the first hour of ONE movie that these people stretched to four. This chapter, Goblet of Fire, could've filled out the final hour of Harry Potter Part One.</li></ul><ul><li>ARG Robert Pattinson. In their defense, he wasn't the UnAlive Creature Bella will lust over in the Twilight series yet, but here's evidence he's been injected with Botox since, at least, age nineteen.</li></ul>Since roughly 75% of this film's fluff doesn't matter – or at least, they've given me, to date, no reason it should, I would suggest people watch #2 while skipping the first and third movies and just be told that things get darker in part four. And not more clearer, as the dark comment indicates.(Editor's Note: I decided to listen to the masses for this Harry POTter phenomena and revisit the series. I've only seen the first two, both once and in first run theatres. Since it's been around a decade since the initial releases, I've started over with #1 and will get to what everyone calls: the better years. Cheerio!)",2,0,0,3 March 2013
In Time," Robin Hood: Men in Time
","Wow. For being 100s (or more) of years in the future, it sure looks like barely anything has changed 'In Time' (3/10 Stars.) Okay, the biggest difference is now people are 'engineered' to stop aging at 25 years old (ALTHOUGH, HALF THE CAST LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE IN THEIR 30s) and have to 'earn' their years following that by either A: Be Wealthy in Years or B: Working minimal jobs for eternity. It's a tad bit confusing at first, but after you get the somewhat original concept of currency now being 'time' everything else is either bland, boring or both. Good-hearted, and expert sprinter, Will (Justin Timberlake) suddenly gains a hundred years when he's told the system is only in place to help the rich, and when his mother quickly 'runs out of time' i.e. dies, he's hell-bent on bringing down the system. But, then he's hell-bent on a new girl. But, then he's hell-bent on helping the less-fortunate. But, then he's hell-bent on...you get the picture that this picture is all over the place. Suffice to say, it's a boring future with a plot that's been around for centuries. It's a Twilight Zone episode that's stretched four times too long and contains far too many (UN-FUNNY) puns on the 'time' word. For example, my ex of many years ago probably got sick of the pun on his name. Let's just say it went something like: J__in Time. (That was just to protect the innocent.)",3,2,5,28 January 2012
Thor," Slightly Above Thorrible
","Hammer time will have to wait for The Avengers movie.This feature length version of Thor and his origins was only marginally better than Marvel's Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, Spider-Man 3 and Daredevil. That's not saying much when you factor in the better Marvel films: Spider-Man 1-2, Iron Man 1-2, X-Men 1, 2, 3 and X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Fantastic Four 1, Hulk and Incredible Hulk and Blade 1, 2, 3. Hmmm. Of the 18 Marvel movies (including Thor) I mentioned, that means, Thor ranks as 15/18.That's not good. Nevertheless, if you're slightly curious, or like CGI-laced movies a lot more than I do, check it out. I wouldn't waste the extra fee for 3D or IMAX, like I did unfortunately, but it's harmless comic-book entertainment. And be forewarned: DO NOT STAY THROUGH THE CREDITS for that extra teaser they've been known to get people hyped for The Avengers movie. At the end of this review, I will SPOIL IT to save you the extra time. Heck, the movie's too darned long anyways.The movie immediately begins with Academy Award Winner Natalie Portman as Jane Foster who's studying with her colleagues in the New Mexican desert and inadvertently runs into banished Thor (a gorgeous Chris Hemsworth – one of the few pluses of the movie). But wait! How did he get dropped into the desert?Well, thanks for asking. Over the next 45 minutes or so, you'll learn the background story of Thor, his King Daddy Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and his oh-so-mysterious brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston – one of the many negatives of the movie.) They run the realm of the good guys, and they don't like the ice baddies who want to make everything and everywhere cold. Their leader must've lived in Phoenix, AZ at one point and for that, we will take their side.The story appears on the surface as kind of complicated, but deeper, it's almost as basic as can be. Thor leads his misfit friends after the ice giants and thus gets banished to Earth – full circle – and now we're back to Academy Award Winner Natalie Portman and her interest in alternative universes and of course, hunk of a man Thor, himself. He, however, is battling everyone to get his precious star-laced Hammer back. Unfortunately, he must learn to be humble to get it back..blah blah blahI never bought his transformation, I just wish there were more of super-powered Thor and the not 'Oh, can't we all get along' idiot they put on the screen.The performances were okay. One in six jokes worked. The graphics were decent – MUCH better than 2010's Clash of the Titans. The only thing I looked forward to, aside from seeing the breathtaking Chris Hemsworth on screen, was the never-ending The Avengers/S.H.I.E.L.D./other superheroes either seen or mentioned. There were a lot, but it was welcomed as I was more interested in the 'coming attractions' and less involved with the actual film I was watching.Again, recommended for the curious, and not recommended for those few that are, to stay through the final credits.(And as promised, SPOILER, here's what you'll see after the seemingly 15-minutes of credits one of the scientists, Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) who worked with Academy Award Winner Natalie Portman's Jane is invited into an underground bunker to meet with, yep, you guessed it: Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) again. Nicky wants to use this power cube, but doesn't understand it and Erik is mucho curious about it untilwe find out he's Thor's evil brother Loki in disguise. Yawn. NOT WORTH IT. Couldn't you have shown Thor VS. (or at least, meets) Hulk? Or even Iron Man (in the suit) going at Thor? Sorry, I love Samuel L. Jackson as much as the next human, but enough. Give us something we haven't seen.)Oh, and by the way, I hope someone had noticed the 'Academy Award Winner Natalie Portman' as sarcasm. And that's another discussion",3,2,6,8 May 2011
The Happening," Bee Aware
","I vowed never again to an M. Night Shyamalan movie after being sorely disappointed in Signs and then hating life after The Village, so I skipped all together Lady in the Water. However, I broke my promise one night: My roommate had this film and I thought, just for a good laugh, I will watch The Happening. And boy did I laugh. Hard. But that was just for the first half of the feature. Towards the middle, it got so incredibly bad, and then worse, I was still in tears, but not from laughing any more. I will keep my promise from here on, I swear. I heard M. Night once compared himself to Hitchcock. That should've been the biggest clue this guy hasn't got one. Hitchcock was never this bad, never were his features as drawn out to the max as M. Night's are, never this unimaginative. Does he seriously think close ups (and there are too many to count in this movie) are scary or suspenseful? Did he seriously tell his cast to cease from acting? Did he seriously write the dialogue? Did he seriously set out to make a serious B-Movie? SPOILER ALERT – Oh, and when you find out the 'secret' in this one, it generates the biggest laughs – if you're still laughing by that point. The trees talk with the grass who pass the word to the flowers and so forth, to DESTROY ALL HUMANS! Really? Seriously? I'm glad I didn't see this in theatres; my laughing out loud probably would've bothered a few (if that many) other viewers.",1,2,4,1 December 2012
The Matrix Reloaded," Matrix Overloaded
","'The Matrix Reloaded' followed the same pattern as Disney's 'Pirates of the Caribbean' series: part one is nearly flawless and an almost classic and is followed by progressively horrid sequels. What 'Reloaded' had going for it was two above par chase/action sequences: Neo's staircase assault and a wonderfully, never-ending freeway chase scene. Beyond that, it was filled to the brim with enough fluff to supply George Lucas with another 'Star Wars' prequel. The Wachowski creators obviously knew what audiences wanted: more, ah-hem, 'smart' and 'biblical' dialogue, more action, more green and characters. They succeeded. In a good way? Not really. The so-called smart dialogue was so laughable, that when it was over I longed and actually had to plug in the MTV Movie awards spoof with Justin Timberlake and Will Farrell that made me crack up on how silly some of the 'Reloaded' scenes/dialogue really was. Again we have Keanu Reeves acting his heart out – albeit disastrous – and asking 'why, why, why' or a million other questions every 2 minutes of screen time. Seriously, we're supposed to believe Trinity actually fell for this doofus and that everyone else believe he's the 'One.' Aside from a short 'Scary Movie' segment on this film and the Will Farrell 'ergo' clip, I wouldn't mind seeing a feature-length spoof as there's plenty to ridicule. Too harsh? Perhaps. After all, it's not as bad as the one that follows. And it's definitively watchable. Again, the Oracle steals her scenes, and (only) some of the special effects were top notch –the fight of the million Smiths was enjoyable, but it was like watching a kid play a Nintendo64 game. Summary: Neo's struggling in his 'Superman' role while real humans plan to ward off machines who plan on murder. Somewhat recommended, though people should've stopped at #1.",3,1,2,17 June 2009
The Fountain," Wishing You Well
","The Fountain is one of those movies so hard to review. Well, okay, for people like me that didn't fully get it. I mean, it's not the easiest thing to admit your ignorance.All the way through this movie, and this is my first time watching it – 5+ years late, it reminded me of a more recent movie, Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life (2011.) In fact, not knowing anything about The Fountain, I thought this movie had Terrence Malick all over it. Not just for the subject matter – both spoke about the actual 'tree of life' – but for the art direction, the mysticism and the space/inner-space journeys. But, alas, I was incorrect. The Fountain was Darren Aronofsky's baby.I digress, The Fountain is a beautiful movie and somewhat deep – though, again, I didn't fully understand the message. As the movie progresses, if you can make it that far (I've heard of people all-but immediately stopping it, not giving it a chance), it slowly, but surely reveals the jumps in time-periods. I counted three separate story lines.The Past. Seems like the Dark Ages – but, then, what do I know – and a man's journey to find the Mayan's 'secret' Tree of Life, the original one from the Garden of Eden.The Present. A Man and His Dying wife. Here's the tad bit clichéd, but effective story of a doctor (Jackman) doing everything (albeit mad) he can to cure cancer to save his wife who's on her deathbed, pretty much.The Future (??). This part kinda reminded me of a Pixar short. A man (could be that same doctor??) in a snow globe (??) heading into space and into a dying star.That last part might throw off a lot of people. It sure as hell did the trick on me.Unlike the more recent The Tree of Life, mercifully, this is only 90 or so minutes, verses the 139 agonizing minutes of Tree. Also, The Fountain got to the point faster where Tree was all over the place and a minute few walked with a new meaning of life.I'm not sure what the meaning of The Fountain really wasbut that's okay. It was entertaining, mesmerizing, had fantastic cinematography and a beautiful score. I just wish I 'got' it more.Perhaps the person that recommended it to me could fill me in a bit. Hint, hint.",8,1,3,2 January 2012
Zombieland," Land of the Rules
","'Zombieland' is a fun, exciting, action-packed comedy-horror, but unfortunately, I didn't like it as much as the general public and critics. Sure, it was all I just mentioned (the 'special guest appearance' and the rules not only flashed on screen, but used as props, were all great) but when it comes to Zombie-humor, you could do better with 'Shaun of the Dead.' That all being said, this one's worth a viewing. Columbus is a loner who lives by rules in a land overrun by zombies, but he meets wildcard Tallahassee and the buddy-comedy begins. Add in two annoying brats (you could say they turned more selfish in attempts to survive because of the outbreak, but they clearly show these two are fiends prior) and you got just another group attempting to maneuver through the living dead. As much as I, personally, have a distain for Harrelson, at very least, this movie gave me two characters who I loathed even more, said brats: Wichita and Little Rock. I especially hated Little Rock more. Eisenberg ('Columbus') holds his own, funny for some part and Harrelson (Twinkie-obsessed 'Tallahassee') is actually enjoyable. The movie's hardly original, and wildly predictable, but overall I'd recommend for light-hearted (despite the gore) fun. The surprise cameo had to be one of the major highlights, yet was ruined by Michael Phillips on 'At the Movies' (shame on you!) Again, though predictable outcome, the cameo has the best line (albeit one word) in the film: 'Garfield.' I've seen more zombie movies than I probably can count, so I do know the rules, however it was fun how they presented and reminded us of them. I would like to have the entire list, just out of curiosity.",5,1,3,8 November 2009
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," The Secret of Numb
","My headline is a little misleading, The Secret of Numb, for I actually enjoyed Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. For, it's a tremendous improvement over the kiddie movie the original was and on its own, it was adventurous and a tad bit more for the YOUNG adult set.And what a difference a year makes: the sets were more elaborate, the special effects thoroughly improved – namely the flying segments during the Quidditch match and they even toned down the five endings from the original to three. Albeit, they were rather long conclusions – I even checked the time when the first of three ended and realized there was still 25 minutes left. I sighed.So, we're still heading into pacing problems and an editor who never read his own job description. And yes, I know we're dealing with writers who want to appease the book club fans and jam every last plot twist, every single character of thousands into more than two and a half hours. Trust me, it's unnecessary.If you want everything from a book, there's an easy solution. READ IT. After reading the fantastic The Stand by Stephen King, I can understand a theatrical release of about two hours simply couldn't put it all in and I'm okay with that. A screenplay writer must read the source material and determine the most important areas to keep and dismiss, regardless of what the audience wants.I digress Even though this movie was, unfortunately, even longer than it's predecessor, it was a lot more fun. And contained a jaw-dropping scary and wonderful spider-attack scene. I'm a sucker for When Animals Attack films and the ones that scare me the most are the ones involving my real-life fears: spiders.But, for the target audience, or at least what the first one seemed to be aiming at, this had to go over their heads a bit. I'd love to count the plot twists and points and the multitude of unusual names and characters because they had to hit close to a hundred. Now, that said, the end all but had our heroes turn 4-D and explain everything in simple English to the viewers.After yet another long stretch of getting Harry back to wizard school following summer vacation, he mercifully uncovers the film's mystery fairly soon after (unlike the original's almost two hours to get to the point.) Even though it's been almost a decade since original release, I won't spoil it, but suffice to say, Harry & the Gang use their individual detective skills along with some sorcery to find out why the Hogwart's residents are being terrorized and/or frozen.When I saw this, again, almost a decade ago – the only time I've seen it, my first impression was of disgust. 'It's a shot-by-shot remake!' I exclaimed to my partner at the time and I vowed never to see another Harry Potter film again. (I will, however, be breaking this rule later today with #3 in my venture down HP Lane)Today, I say: Eh, it did have a lot of the same elements and almost the same ending(s), but it certainly evolved as I hear the rest of the series does as well. If someone were to ask me where to start with Harry Potter and they've never seen any of them, I would – right now – say this one. There's zero reason to begin with #1 when this gives you all you need to know about the cast and settings rather abruptly and efficiently.It's not perfect and it's not a movie I will rush to any time soon, but thinking of it as a stand-alone young adult ticket, it's recommended.(Editor's Note: I decided to listen to the masses for this Harry POTter phenomena and revisit the series. I've only seen the first two, both once and in first run theatres. Since it's been around a decade since the initial releases, I've started over with #1 and will get to what everyone calls: the better years. Cheerio!)",5,1,1,3 March 2013
Die Hard," Die Happy
","Despite its flaws, 'Die Hard' remains as one of the best action films of all time. I've seen this movie dozens of times, and really enjoyed its sequels (aside from part 2, a la 'Indiana Jones 2.') This absolute classic set all the standards, or in better terms, clichés. So, if you watch this today, you might recognize a lot of the scenes, dialogue, 'surprises,' but real 'die hard' fans will see this started it all. Much like 'Halloween' really was the birth of the slasher film (others will dispute, but it really was Michael Myers that started the trends.) Unfortunately for the copy-cats, 'Die Hard' had an excellent villain (Rickman) and supporting cast. In addition, and most importantly, it had Bruce Willis who was, I've read, the bottom of the barrel choice of the producers and yet, contributed the most depth of ANY HERO of these 'Die Hard' rip offs. He had great lines, depth, realistic approach, was vulnerable, and simply human. As stated, despite its flaws (the white-to-green wife beater was solely a distraction and the fact two main characters seemed to just ride off in the sunset – yes, it was part of the storyline, but surely unrealistic to the rest of the 'it could really happen' plot) 'Die Hard' was nearly perfect, and this was thanks to nearly perfect performances from Rickman and Willis. Not to mention the continuous and great action sequences. Basically, on Christmas Eve, Willis flies into LA from NYC to make good with wife only to help hostages during a heist. Only thing I would've done differently in Willis' role was, when he had the police on the secret radio, was to threatened the President. I'm sure that would've brought more than just the police. And $.74 gas? Wow, I love the 80s!",9,1,1,9 May 2009
Psycho," The Original and Best 'Wrong Turn' Movie
","(Spoilers – in fact, this movie should be watched by all before any reviews read. Experience it first and then learn so much more.) It pained me when I heard that M. Night Shyamalan compared himself to Alfred Hitchcock. Where Shyamalan's movies are simply dreadful, half-assed, slow and contain hilariously bad scripts, Hitchcock remains the master no matter what year you watch his films. 'Psycho' is my all-time favorite Hitchcock film, and one of the best suspenseful movies of all time. It has such depth, both the intriguing (even today) story and characters, never a dull moment was experienced here. And talk about before his time; this movie was ingenuous: The main character is not only enormously flawed (a Hitchcock staple, and one I love so much about his films – see: 'The Birds') but she dies half-way through the feature, leading the way to another, more iconic main character: Norman Bates. I personally wasn't around in 1960, but I'm sure this caused quite a stir with its graphic scenes (by today's standard, this is PG) but I'm glad they didn't just go for the gore. The story, acting, cinematography, and especially the incredible score, were all brilliant. Everything about this movie is excellence, and I am glad that this and that famous shower scene is studied in film classes. This is what movie-making is all about. Marion is attempting to 'escape' with the man she loves by stealing $40,000 to pay off his debts. Though her 'inner-voice' gnaws away at her since the theft, just as her conscious gets to her, Bates and his mental illness (shown superbly and believably by Perkins) puts an end to that. Everything works in this masterpiece. In fact, books could be written about all the angles this took, and I'm sure they have been.Side Note: I live in Phoenix, AZ, and despite it being hot for a good 6-7 months out of the year, it's rarely, make that, I've never experienced a hot day in mid-December like they supposedly said it was in this film. Perhaps they made it in the summer, or they've never visited Phoenix before and assumed it's always hot. That is the only 'flaw' I detected in this excellent film, and even that's really no big deal.",10,0,0,2 November 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," How the Mighty have 'Fallen'
","or 'Revenge of the 'Fallen' I.Q.s' would be more appropriate subtitles.Sure, the original cartoon 'Transformers: The Movie' had problems and 2007's 'Transformers' was a crime against society. 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' was just a plain, horrid mess.I have to give it kudos for its homage only to the 2007 movie: continual product placement, enormously bad and juvenile humor and robot battle scenes where you can't tell the good from the bad. The best they did to improve was voiding Sam's (LaBeouf) insistent need to repeat the same word 7x, such as 'no,no,no,no,no,no,no'I had extremely low expectations for this movie after (the insult to the original source material) 2007's version, so I figured I might actually like it. And it wasn't 100% bad: some battle scenes were good and I've seen worse, but yeah it was trash, all the same. As for some people/critics ripping on the 'racial' stereotypes, I have one comment: they weren't bad due to the bigotry, they were bad because they were simply horribly created (CGI,) had awful lines and too 'Jar-Jar'ish. That should be insult to any race, creed or human enough.We're given absolutely no script, no direction, scenes that are completely incoherent from the previous, painful dialogue and so-called 'touching' scenes, flat-out lies (it is told that multiple Autobots came to Earth, yet, there's probably a grand total of 6 on Earth, not much more from the 2007 version,) comical acting – trust me, I was laughing out loud when we're supposed to believe Mikaela (Megan) was scared, clichés from here to Cybertron, enough swearing and partial (male) nudity for an R-rating and roughly 45 minutes that could've been easily cut – the movie went on longer than it took Frodo to ditch the ring.You'd think with all the dumbed down gags it was meant for the younger, naïve crowd, but they up'd the ante from 2007's masturbation-talk scene to include numerous sexual references (robodog humping Mikaela) and even roboballs. Those and all other jokes fall flat and make me wish I was 4 again so I could've enjoyed it.Weakly, they reintroduce Sam by a fragment of the All-Spark and now a resurrected Megatron needs it to, oh, I can't remember (or care) why and I just watched it. Bay just made the movie to sell toys, cars and Mt. Dew and show beautiful young women, big robots and explosions. Hmm, I wonder what demographic it was meant for?",2,8,19,27 June 2009
The Witch," Not Really VVitchbored
","I think this movie made me more afraid of religion than VVitchcraft. I asked a question of my friends today at work, and I did receive some good answers. I asked, summed up: since I don't believe in magic, witchcraft or other things associated with witches, I wonder how really the Salem witch trials went down. I did receive some sad and definitely gruesome answers, but in a logical sense. Exactly what I was looking for and what I believe in. Now, this movie is pure fiction, but it was absolutely amazing on how well they recreated life before the American Revolution. The dialogue, cinematography, sets, acting, clothing, accentsall outstanding. Plus the minimal special effects and clever mood made this a must-see for real horror buffs.Now, that saidto see a second time? Or more accurately, is it worthy of repeat viewings? Not for me. Still, I would recommend it for people who want to get back to the root of evil in horror movies.Basically, it's Christian man vs. Christian men and who's the better Christian. The men, and village prevail, and the man (with his large family in tow) are banished. Surprisingly, the one man is able to build a large house, barn(s,) fields, crops and get livestock in fairly no time. Also, in no time, their youngest gets snatched into the nearby woods and the search is on! (Not really – we only hear of a search for their baby that they pretty much give up on instantly.) From there, it's paranoia and fear, not to mention concerns about eating into the winter, for the family. As real and authentic as the movie sounded and looked, a ton of the time I found it hard to understand what they were saying. Luckily, they were always praying or scared of God or the demonic possessions, so it was easy to tell what the context was. Despite not believing in voodoo, black magic, spells and the like, it was refreshing not to see yet another ghost, haunted and/or found footage horror movie. Way to go, HollywoodI am sincerely proud you can think outside the cash box. ***Final thoughts: Though, that would've been awesome to see a found footage movie set in the 1630s. It probably would've been more realistic than most found footage movies set in/around today's time.",5,5,11,31 May 2016
When Harry Met Sally...," What can be said about this orgasm of fantastic dialogue, originality and acting?
","30th Anniversary: 1989 - the Best Year in Cinema Marathon Film #51/100: 'When Harry Met Sally...' (8/10 Stars, Released: 7/14/89, Second Viewing.) What can be said about this orgasm of fantastic dialogue, originality and acting? I'd probably rate this higher if I wanted to continuously see it and not let 30 or so years pass and I'm good without viewing it again. That said, this is highly recommended and followed by the Ethan Hawke/Julie Delpy Before trilogy.",8,1,1,28 July 2019
Zero Dark Thirty," One Zero Dark Times
","I feel obligated to re-write a brand new review of Zero Dark Thirty.On January 14th, I wrote my heartfelt review of this movie with my true feelings about all the events and characters portrayed. Sadly, I feel the need to censor myself and save myself from, well, me.No, I don't believe in censorship, but I do believe in choosing to live. What I originally wrote was fairly harsh and absolutely opinionated on how I feel about the topics brought up in this movie. In the light of self-preservation, I am only releasing this second commentary of one of the great movies of 2012.The best part of Zero Dark Thirty was the fantastic performance of Jessica Chastain. Everyone else was good, she was excellent. I hope she wins for the Best Actress Oscar.The cinematography, score, dialogue and acting were all top notch, as was the directing. I can understand Lincoln might win, and while I wouldn't be upset with that, this is a great and suspenseful film of one CIA agent's plight of finding Bin Laden.I understand this is very unusual of me to release a second opinion of my own opinion, but trust me when I say: Even I can recognize I can be over-the-top at times and for the safety of Steve, trust me when I release only the good points.Side Note: Anyone curious, ha, please feel free to email me and I will send you a copy of my original and stronger approach to this film.",9,0,5,17 January 2013
Steve Jobs," All About Another Steve
","I guess it helps I never saw the other panned JOBS movie. But, it hurt the world and I didn't care about the man or mac.See, I've never been an Apple guy. I *had* to use them in the newsroom in college because that's what they had and before that, I do recall using the Apple IIe in Grammar School. When I was able to purchase, or have purchased/made for me, I chose the IBM or anything-but an Apple product. Today is no different.So, when the first JOBS movie opened, I didn't care to see it. And when it was severely panned, all the more reason to avoid it. I heard about the second attempt at a film about Jobs and rolled my eyes, as most of America did. Yes, I heard it was praised and then became part of history with a couple of Oscar nods. Since I watch all the Oscar main nominations, finally I had to see it.I think we were all wrong. This is a very good movie with two fantastic and well-deserved nominee performances.Completely original and tight, the great director, Danny Boyle takes only three aspects of Jobs' life to spin his tale of 'always being right.' Minutes before three of his huge presentation/launches from the 80s to 90s are shown to give us most of what happened in between.Michael Fassbender has always been great and here, he really shines once again. Sadly, I never knew the real Steve Jobs, or seen him in any video other than ones that parodied him. And at first, I didn't recognize Kate Winslet and she was good as always. Not her best, but damn well had me rooting for her. All the supporting cast was good as well.Too bad this movie was overlooked because of the hate on the fairly recent JOBS fiasco. Boyle did an excellent, ah-hem, job here and it really should be seen. Even if you're not a fan like I'm not, the screenplay alone is fast and fun. Totally worth it.***Final thoughts: I'm probably gonna get sued by the Jobs estate, but when I was a kid and we couldn't afford either an IBM or Mac, I was gifted a Radio Shack 16k Color Computer II where I programmed my own AppleWorks software we used in school. See, we couldn't afford software either, so it was up to me to make my own and I *loved* the AppleWorks program. So, I learned basic programming and created: CocoWorks (Coco being the nickname for the Color Computer from Radio Shack.) It had the three main components from AppleWorks: a word processor, a database and a spreadsheet. Or, what we call today: Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel. It was fully functional and I was thoroughly proud of it. Maybe someday I can find that program I made or at least a print out from it. I miss doing those programs.",8,0,1,17 January 2016
Love Actually," Actually, I Used to Love That Song
","Real quick review for me...I thought I would give that one another chance after only mildly liking it a decade ago - my only other viewing. I did NOT disagree with my younger self - it was just alright.Not bad and I admired a lot of it, but the enormous amount of coincidences, length and only somewhat neat interactions left me with the: eh, last time seeing this one.NOT TO MENTION...THAT SONG...OMG, I got sooo tired of hearing the main song 29x throughout. I used to really dig it and I understand the meaning behind them playing it, but they really should've re-titled it to DEAD HORSE.That all said, I did admire a Christmas movie geared ONLY to adults whereas most compromise to make it for everyone to make more money. Took balls - and in one scene, well, spoiler - to do that.",4,0,2,9 December 2015
12 Years a Slave," Sounds Sooo Familiar
","I sure did get in trouble once. I'm not saying where, but let's just say it was at one of my employments. I entered into a conversation on where people were talking about a certain group of individuals that were oppressed. I casually mentioned that gays have been mistreated and even killed by bigots.One person, in particular, blew up and I should've predicted the HR call coming a couple of days following. I was not – neither back then nor now – stating African Americans had it worse or the same as gay people. But BOTH parties had/have it pretty bad.Here, in 12 Years a Slave, I kept witnessing the Bible being used as an instrument of destruction, for justification of slavery. Well, in today's time, I hear the same thing: People using the Bible as a weapon against humans, specifically the homosexual community. So, I do make a comparison between the parties.I digress, this movie was fantastic. The performances unique, rich and deep. The originality on the WHITE MAN BAD, SLAVERY/OPPRESSION WORSE genre of film as of late was refreshing and the lead actor, Chiwetel Ejiofor and his character of Solomon Northup was incredibly invigorating. Hell, the movie itself was great, but he and his character alone, is worth watching the whole film.In probably the most original story of slavery I've seen, 12 Years a Slave tells the 'true' tale of Northern/free man Solomon Northup who was deceived, kidnapped and sold to the South as a slave for __ years. Now this movie is only 134 minutes long or just past two hours, but I wanted more. I wanted to hear, or read more of this man's plight. (Luckily, this was based on his novel, so I will have to check that out.)Aside from one clichéd and obvious character – I won't spoil who this was, but let's just say: he's one of the producers, I got a clean prospective on this topic (again: WHITE MAN BAD, SLAVERY/OPPRESSION WORSE) than I've seen in the countless movies of the past couple of years.Absolutely recommended. This story of this man, this incredibly bright, talented and loving man, should reach your heart, too.* * * Final thoughts: Sorry, Chiwetel. Any other year, I might vote for you to be Best Actor at the Oscars. This year, I vote for Matthew McConaughey in Dallas Buyers Club, his best performance to date. And this is coming from someone who loved him in the same year's Mud. But you were still great, Chiwetel!",8,0,1,18 January 2014
Sausage Party," Meat Me at This Sausage Fest
","Can you imagine this and Food Fight as a double feature? You'd get two times the laughs even though only Sausage Party's were intentional.While not perfect, sometimes clichéd and relied heavily on swearing to fill in aimless writing zones, this was a hoot and worth the whole trip. Speaking of which, in three days we Phoenicians will find out if we can, in fact, watch this while trippinglegally, anyways.I digressThe movie was clever for the most part and got progressively funnier until the climaxclimax. Sausage Party basically is an atheist story and yet still promotes personal beliefs. That's mostly hard to do, so well done, guys.The film's grocery store is filled with fourth dimensional living beings we gods, er humans, refer to as products. They believe once they're selected, and not expired, they'll go to the great beyond and live happily. Well, no. But, they don't know thatthey can't possibly start to doubt their religionsThere's much more to the plot as I gave the briefest of synopsizes. Fill in the gaps with multiple subplots, cussing, sexual innuendos, hope and even bun-curious behavior. It's cute, NOT for kids and while it doesn't add much to your life, it's a freaking fun ride that sometimes barely lets up. Totally worth it.***Final thoughts: I wish I had seen this in theatres. I would probably laugh just as hard seeing the parents leaving abruptly with their children five minutes in as the movie itself. I mean, reallynot all cartoons are for kids. Much like not all adults should bear children.",7,1,4,5 November 2016
Burlesque," Burle Femmes
","Picture it: Super bowl 2014. I had to find the movies to watch during 'the game' that would be such the opposite from what the core audience of that silly football game would want to see. Part I of my night was my first time seeing: Burlesque.Now, I absolutely love Cher. Mildly like Christina Aguilera and the rest of the cast, but I live by and salute Cher. Still, it took me until 2/2/2014 to see Burlesque. Maybe because I thought it was a musical, or because the trailers that spoiled everything, weren't that appealing.After seeing the film, I recognized all the clichés, the problems, the bad acting, bad dialogue and been-there-done-that moments. Still, I liked it. With reservations.Small-town girl with a big heart gets sucked into the glamour of showbiz and, SHOCKER, she makes it big. Glitter takes over and she has to remain grounded long enough for her and the All About Eve Mentor (i.e. Cher,) to both get along, but work together to defeat the thin plot of their adversary.This movie is a definite leave-your-brain-at-the-door feature. It's nothing huge, special or refreshing, but it is fun when you ignore all that's come before it. Perhaps, I'm biased, but c'monit's Cher. She's not getting any younger and it's great to see her spunk once more. And the music's great, the humor, though obvious, is still nice and the set/costumes, while unrealistic, are still entertaining.They didn't make a groundbreaking film and I'm sure all involved would admit that. But, they made something enjoyable for a laid back, mid-Saturday feature to watch.Take heed, however: You probably should really enjoy Cher to enjoy this. Or maybe think Christina's hot? I dunno.What I do know is: don't expect the world, and you'll want a ticket to Burlesque.* * * Final thoughts: Oddly enough, though I did chose this as my first film of my double feature during the 2014 Super Bowl, it would also serve me when I later discovered the podcast: How Did This Get Made? This was their very first podcasted subject, so I could safely listen to that spoiler-rich 'cast while they unabashedly and hilariously bashed the film. They also pointed out a ton I missed. But, then, again, I wasn't looking too deep. Like watching a Friday the 13th sequel – a later one, that is, one cannot expect 5/5 stars. Just leave that brainat the door.",5,0,1,25 March 2014
Man on Fire," Taken Seriously
","I wonder if Bryan Mills read the case files of John W. Creasy before he went to retrieve his kidnapped daughter four years after Creasy's bloody rampage. Hmmm.You want no-holds-barred revenge? No sympathy, no mercy and no escape? Meet the established unforgiven Creasy as he takes on his new role of bodyguard to safeguard an insurance policy. Oh, and a little girl in Mexico City.Extremely bad hombres or 'professionals,' are kidnapping citizens in Latin America at an alarming rate. This is one of those stories. After what seems like the LONGEST OPENING ACT IN CINEMA HISTORY, or roughly 34.25% of the full movie, they've established the unredeemable 'hero' and drunk becomes lovable to both the audience and the little girl he's hired to protect. Bam! Surprise, she's kidnapped. After a botched ransom drop-off, Creasy's bent on revenge against the organization who kidnapped his little friend. And 'revenge' is putting it mildly. What he does to these disgusting humans would make Satan flinch. Problems. You have to get used to a shaky cam. It's Director Tony Scott's signature move, but it's enormously distracting for the most part. Okay, all parts. Also, as stated, it takes an enormous time to get to the goods. Literally all he's trying to establish in those first 50 minutes could've been summed up in one quarter the time or less. I only saw this movie once and near the time it came out, around 2004+. That was about 14 years ago and I remembered only one scene - hint: it showed more uses for a car's cigarette lighter than just for smokes. So, this was like a fresh viewing for me and still I could predict practically all that was going to happen. It's not hard to figure out the story - even with the camera abruptly shaking every few moments.Now, the positives are worth the whole experience. Denzel Washington (Creasy,) as always, was fantastic. Believable human being from start to finish. The supporting cast, including Christopher Walken and Rachel Ticotin, also very good. I did like the cinematography and the unapologetic and brutal/true view of the 'interrogations' from Creasy. RIP Scott, and I know what he was trying to accomplish in this movie, especially in the opening 34.25%, but seriously, read my synopsis above and skip to about 45 minutes into this. That's about how much could've been cut from this overlong film to make it tighter and so that we could get to the actual plot.This uses the backdrop of Mexico City and all the kidnappings from horrible and vile people. But, really, this is Denzel's movie. Any true fan of Denzel needs to see this excellent performance of his. Well, those people and people who wanna see the bad guys really, REALLY pay for their greedy sins.***Final thoughts: In-between 24's Jack Bauer and Taken's Bryan Mills is John Creasy. If you liked the first two I mentioned, you'll warm right up with Creasy. Heck, throw in The Transporter's Frank Martin and have a TV/Movie marathon. So, watch, in any particular order: 24: Season 8, Taken (avoid the sequels,) The Transporter 2 (#1 is optional, but #2 fits more here) and Man on Fire. Now that...would leave anyone exhausted from all the eye-for-an-eye blows and still pleased with the ride.",5,1,2,4 July 2018
Edge of Tomorrow," Tomorrow Always Dies
","I know the sad truth that Tom Cruise isn't a box office draw and hasn't been for a good decade or so. It is sad because he consistently brings his A-game and above average films to the screen. Last year was the enjoyable Oblivion and before that, I thoroughly enjoyed his fourth Mission: Impossible film and romantic-action Knight and Day.Even with that said, I was hesitant – actually a tad more than that, on seeing Edge of Tomorrow, a movie that I already pegged as Groundhog Day 2: Source Codes and I thought he was stuck on the futuristic, heavy metal genre that I was getting tired of. Mercifully, a friend briefly tempted me to go see it with him and I abruptly made the correct choice to join him.Immediately into the feature, I felt Director Doug Liman's presence and was pleased. Of course, I am a huge fan of his films, mainly The Bourne Identity, Mr. & Mrs. Smith and Go, but to me, even the best directors rarely hit home runs the majority of the time. Hereyeah, even with knowing the very basic concept of the film, I knew I was in a quality made film and one I would enjoy even when the 'big reveal' came to fruition that was completely foretold in both the trailers and posters.And since it was not hidden, it's no spoiler for me to say, the film's about a cowardly, non-soldier military officer who keeps waking up the same day-before-battle (once he dies) only to attempt to both figure out why it's happening and how to deal with the literal day-in/day-out monotony. Luckily for him, he all-but immediately finds his biggest clue with super soldier, Rita, and together they'll work on the winless battle they are in against unfriendly alien invaders.The performances were pretty good, mainly with Emily Blunt as Rita, and I always favor Cruise in his films. The action was fun and the side jokes, or mostly one-liners from Cruise, were often hilarious. And as much as CGI, big Sci-Fi alien action and blow'em up! films aren't a draw for me, this one worked for me and reminded me of a much better version of The Matrix Revolutions.Now, the only real downsides were the unimaginative alien race (again, SEE: The Matrix films) and the script wasn't fully there yet. Normally, I would mark down on the initial and somewhat unoriginal concept, but this did its own take on that and added more than enough to get past my preliminary fears of seeing Groundhog Day/Source Code all over again.Overall, it's a definite recommendation with a largely fun, funny and enjoyable first two acts and a completely satisfying and refreshing conclusion – one we rarely see any more and I mostly yearn for. * * *Final thoughts: Once again, Liemax and 3D has disappointed me. First off, we all know, or should, that the majority of 'IMAX' screens are mini-versions of the true IMAX experience. AMC is notorious for these. I accept that since there are only two (that I know of) true IMAX screens in the state I live in and the closest doesn't usually play motion pictures as well as it's kinda far. In the case of Edge of Tomorrow, it didn't even fit the full Liemax screen causing a hilarious, but disappointing, letterboxed version on the big screen. Secondary, the 3D was eh, as usual. I truly wish there was an alternative IMAX, ah-hem, even Liemax screen, that showed the 2D version. I could just go see them in the normal screen, but even with these problems, it's still slightly better than normal. My plea is that they show some standards and not settle for this mediocre attempt just to get a couple of extra dollars out of us. And, with the low box office so far – even on day 2 of release, hopefully, they'll try and do better because this is not encouraging me to give any positive word of mouth for the Liemax 'experience.'",8,4,8,7 June 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," We're Wolf Watchers
","WOW. Those previews of this movie, The Wolf of Wall Street, couldn't be any more accurate. Basically, it told me all I needed to know: everything.Upon watching this undeserved Best Picture Nominated movie, I couldn't believe my eyes. There wasn't an unpredictable part of this movie, as predicted by the movie's trailer. I take that back. I did not predict that this THREE HOUR MOVIE would have a good hour of cut'able footage.I could've easily sliced out an hour of unneeded and obvious footage in the movie and even though the remaining two hours still wouldn't be fresh by any means, at least the audience didn't have to waste three hours on the same ole story – they just had to waste two.Let's see: Young hotshot wants to make it big for him and his wife. He's still wet behind the ears, but dives right into the greed of Wall Street and makes his own mark after a speed bump derails him temporarily. He's – get this! – consumed by the money, power, girls, drugs and luxury. Oh, no! What will ever become of him?Supposedly, though probably, true, this rise and fall story is so blatantly obvious from the get-go, you'll wonder why you need to see another 2 hours, 59 minutes of the story you already know how will unravel from minute one.Granted, the performances are decent – no, it wasn't Leo's best, and the film was professionally made, I just could never get past the A-B-C story of the Rise-and-Fall of the greedy. Nothing new was brought to the table with the exception of a few jokes and scenes so extended that they should've been in the extended cut BluRay and not in the original cut.While absolutely not a waste of time or film – it does boast the most F-bombs that you're sure to become immune to – it's so old, you'd think you're watching a 'true story' of the old west.* * * Final thoughts: How this got an R-Rating for this extreme amount of nakedness, sexuality, language, violencemakes me wonder who owns the MPAA. Especially when But I'm a Cheerleader almost got an NC-17 rating because it involved lesbians but not 1/1000th of the debauchery here.",4,23,40,18 January 2014
Army of Darkness," Bravehearts of Darkness
","Wow, this doesn't happen all the time, probably rarely, but I love a good make-up part three of a trilogy. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Ocean's Thirteen and Die Hard with a Vengeance come to mind, but now, I will add Army of Darkness.This is not to say Indy 2, Ocean's 12 or Die Hard'er were terrible, they really weren't, but the third chapter redemption is always refreshing. I will say, however, this does not apply to the Evil Dead (original) trilogy, as Evil Dead II, or The Evil Dead Redux, was just plain atrocious.Not only was Army of Darkness a fun, exciting and often hilarious movie – thanks, Brucey! – but it's one of those rare sequels that takes the main character from the saga, along with some of the established themes, into a whole new dimension. You couldn't seriously be as far away from the first two chapters in regards to setting, direction or, uh, time period, as Director Sam Raimi took Army of Darkness.Now, that all said, this wasn't perfect, by any means, and as much as I found it entertaining and original – for the series, that is – it's not a new take on period piece movies with swords, castles and grand scale battles. And as the movie progresses, it fell deeper and deeper into old film clichés.Almost taking place immediately following the events in part II – and I emphasize the word almost, because they seemed to either forget what exactly happened at the end of the last chapter, or they wrote themselves into a corner previously and they hoped no one would notice, Ash (played wonderfully and hysterically by Bruce Campbell) is taken prisoner in the 1300s after being sucked into a vortex that was meant to rid present day of the 'evil dead.'Without so much as a trial or sentencing, he's just tossed into a well of hell and, in good old fashioned Ash-way, he proves himself and lives. Some claim him to be a prophesied warrior 'from the sky' to rid the land of evil by retrieving the same book that sent him back in time in the first place. Also, Ash-like, he'd much rather save himself and get back in (the right) time than help the villagers.Ash must survive the evil dark lands/cemetery and it's amusing incarnations and bring back the book. Will Ash save his own ash, or care about other ash's when all hell breaks loose after his book journey?Recently, in 2013, the remake (well, second remake, if you rightfully count the second installment as the first reboot) came out and, I'll take a guess, since I won't be seeing it for another few hours, reinvents the first wheel. My hope is that they follow that up with a remake of this, for, while this was often witty and had some pretty decent lines, I can see an even better version of this. There seemed to be a lot of missed opportunities by the writers and I stand behind them spending a little more time to get this even more hilarious.Also, I am not always a fan of the 'Director's Cut' of films. Granted, I applaud them for being able to show us their true and verified visions, but mostly, I find when a director takes advice from either crew members, or sneak-peak audience members, it's just plain good advice. In this case, unfortunately, I only had the 'Director's Cut' to see and I recalled a different ending. While this one (no spoilers) was decent, and actually makes sense in regards to the events leading up to the end, it was a too-quick resolution. I YouTubed the original theatrical ending, found what I remembered seeing this many years ago when I first saw this and felt that one was longer, funnier, more exciting and deserved to be in all 'cuts' of the film. Seriously, Raimi, how could you think your 'cut' was better than the theatrical one?Both endings worked, but, again, I prefer the original's. I digress. Even if you hadn't seen the first two movies, and I would highly recommend the first one of two only, this almost stand-alone is well worth your time for a little early 90s campy fun.And who can go wrong with the great Bruce Campbell at his best?** - In comparison, his worst was just one movie back, Evil Dead II.",6,0,2,6 April 2013
Scream 2," Aliens was better than Alien. That's all I have to say.
","When 'Scream 2' came out, now more than a decade ago, I loved it. In fact, it landed on my top 10 superior (or equal to) sequels to the originals. Now, watching the trilogy complete, it's not as good as I remembered it. Sure it has a lot of good points: Courtney and Neve look great! The tongue-in-cheek sequel jokes/statements are great. I always love Olyphant, Pinkett, Jackson and Gellar. And they really up'd the ante on making the now-familiar 'whodunit' storyline a little more mysterious. Unfortunately, the bad way outweighs the good. Though, I loved the creativity, dialogue and theme to the opening, it was just plain way too drawn out and pointless to the remainder of the movie. (I see how they matched the first movie's intro, but at least that was more scary and interesting, overall.) The rest of the movie follows suit – it's way longer than it needed to be, so much could've been cut. And the coincidences/plot holes were pretty thick. It's years later, they've made a movie(-within a movie, 'Stab') which apparently sparks another blood bath for anyone who hangs out with the survivors from part one. I don't want to sound too harsh; I enjoyed this feature, it has a lot of creativity to it and it's worth watching. It has some intense scenes – my favorite is the courtyard search, but coincidentally it saddens me that my favorite character is off'd during this scene. I can't spoil too much, but the closing (another long and drawn out scene) had me rolling my eyes. As did that horrible 'Top Gun' homage. I am not at all a fan of Jerry O'Connell and definitively not one of the worst actors: Liev Schreiber, and he didn't do much to change that here. Still worth a view.",6,0,1,24 October 2009
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Enjoy Summer in this City
","It's a pity 'Die Hard with a Vengeance' didn't make a bigger splash at the box office. This movie was great. I've seen this installment more times than any of the other 3 'Die Hard' films with good reason: hilarious dialogue – from both Willis and Jackson who steals every scene he's in, exciting plot, character development, original explosive scenes (way before 9/11, obviously – in fact, I'm sure, following the real life '01 terrorist attacks, New Yorker's had a hard time watching this) that held very little CGI – the real way to make films and a great archenemy, Irons, who also stole his scenes. It was great to see a 'Die Hard' film predominately in daylight, or any action film for that matter. And to add both enemy and hero alike suffering from massive headaches made it all the more real. Sure, it wasn't perfect: some plot holes were bigger than the wounds inflicted by Willis and some scenes were pretty laughable, even by 1995's standards – watch the water filling the tunnel, a la 'Escape from L.A.' But, still, watching John finally teaming up with the master of bad-ass – Jackson, was worth every minute. It was also refreshing to see an off-white racist for once, as they do exist, but rarely shown in cinema. Predictable, yes, and as part 2 demonstrated, if the big spoiler isn't obvious with the first viewing, it's painfully evident in this chapter. Finally home in NYC, McClane (Willis) is sent on a cat & mouse 'Simon Says' deadly game with Zeus (Jackson) all across the city, ditching the claustrophobic atmosphere of the first 2 installments all the while Simon (Irons) sets traps, a plan and plays God. Fun, lighthearted, great action sequences, and definitively not to be taken too seriously, this is an absolute must watch.",9,1,1,15 May 2009
Con Air," A Vegas Con
","This is a movie I saw once, back in the theatres in 1997 when it was released, I hated it, had a strong opinion on it and just never thought I would ever see again. Thanks to the great podcast, How Did This Get Made?, reviewing this movie, I broke that last promise. (It's always best to watch the movie they cover in order to follow their hilarious commentary on the feature.) Anyhoo, there are just too many things both wrong and boring about this movie, but suffice to say, my 18-year complaint was the enormous continuity errors involving the climactic battle in Las Vegas:1: As the plane is crashing down onto Las Vegas Blvd, it passes the Stratosphere and immediately crashes into the Hard Rock neon giant guitarwhich is 5 miles away.2. Following that, they are back on the strip and crashes into a casino that hasn't been there in just about a year in 1997: The Sands.3. Once the convicts exit the crash site, they steal vehicles and within seconds, they're on the old stripwhich is 5 miles away.4. Somehow once on the old strip, they manage to enter the airport tunnelthat's not just 5 miles away, it somehow expands three times its actual length.5. And...then they're magically back on the old strip upon leaving said tunnel from 5 miles away. This movie really isn't worth reviewing, but getting Vegas wrong in movies and TV gets me cranky. And for those of you who say: Well, not everyone's been there, so not everyone would know. Well, I say: I have never been to New York City, but I do know I can't walk from Central Park and within 3 seconds I'm in Long Island, and then take a left and end up at the Statue of Liberty and then jog a bit to Queens and turn around to be on Staten Island. To really screw up Las Vegas like that is just pure laziness and an insult to moviegoers. Oh, and really the rest of the movie sucked. So skip it!",2,1,4,3 May 2015
"Hail, Caesar!"," Hail Storm Warning
","Man, it's been two days since I've seen this, and thank God, it's fading fast. What a waste. Oh, those Coen BrosHIT and SO MUCH MISS is their career. When they're on, i.e. No Country for Old Men, The Big Lebowski or Fargo, they're priceless. When they miss, like O Brother, Where Art Thou, A Serious Man or this Hail, Caesar!, they crash and burn. In their defense, O Brother and Serious Man weren't terrible, just not their best work. This one is just dreadful. I get everything they were telling me. I could follow the 'stories.' And I know most of this, if not all of it, was true from what happened back in the days before TV took off. They just failed to make it interesting.For the most part, it was an incredible chore to get through. Just a series of scenes spliced together. Some coherent, some wacky (Coens Brand,) some boring. Many subplots wrapped around a man doing his job and questioning his fit there.Problem is, actually there were many, but the main one was that none of the 40 or so plots were interesting. Great, we get to see a greatest hits collection of the Coen's usual suspects, some in heavy makeup albeit still recognizable, some in photoshopped glamour. While it was somewhat interesting to say, 'Oh! There's Frances McDormand!' I just saw them there more for friendship than the script.On the surface, it was just showing the tyrant leadership and behind the scenes of cinema back in the 50s. But dig deeper and you'll rupture a sewage pipe andthat wasn't a discovery I wanted or expected from the Coens.***Final thoughts: Man, I used to be the biggest George Clooney fan. For a decade or so following his Rock Bottom Batman, he just kept getting progressively better. ThenTomorrowland. Thenthis. Uh, we need you back to your fantastic Michael Clayton, Ocean's Eleven and Up in the Air days. Please come back to us, Clooney. These recent choices make you almost look like you wanna go (back) to the E.R. for brain surgery.",2,1,4,12 April 2016
The Reader," Read Deep
","I have heard the first half of 'The Reader' was misunderstood in relation to the second half, or overall story. I also felt the same way during act one. In fact, it was hard to look past the numerous sex scenes and full frontal nudity from both male and female. But, alas, I believe it all came together to fully show how completely messed up this woman, Hanna, (Kate Winslet) made Michael's (Ralph Fiennes) life. What's odd, and is very little attention is paid to the (no spoiler here) pedophile Hanna is. We definitely live in a very contradictory society when it comes to sexuality. It's generally okay for two women to be in a relationship (and usually rooted on,) but it's an abomination for two men and it's a mortal sin for an adult male to have sexual relations with an under-aged female (or male) but it's barely even mentioned  or poked fun at  if it's an adult female with a boy. I will probably never understand this and it's relevant in this film as, if it's mentioned, it's hardly an issue when Hanna seduces and steals Michael's youth  and eventual life. Overall, it's a beautiful, if disturbing, film, with great performances from Fiennes and definitely Winslet. Not to try and reveal anything, she is truly a monster, and Winslet deserves an Oscar (and Globe) for such a powerful look into her demon she seems fine with sweeping under the carpet. Young Michael, (David Kross) the victim (in more ways than one) seemed to try his best; I give him kudos for effort and the ability to bear all. Little can be said about the plot, without spoilers, but it's definitely a must-see film about potential war crimes, and the victims that stack up. Even when the war's over.",8,2,2,25 January 2009
Jaws," The Great Bite
","Just a quick note on Steven Spielberg's Masterpiece Jaws: Everything works. Yes, the whole background story on the movie came out years ago, their mechanical shark kept sinking, etc, but as for the final product: (let me repeat) everything worked. Score, acting, dialogue, suspense, realism, plot development, urgency, you name it. I have read the book, and of course there were changes – anyone yet comment on the missing love affair between Brody's wife and Hooper? – but, all novels change from page to screen. What Spielberg did was amazing. He didn't create a horror movie. Nor a shark movie. It was a movie concerning a small town 100% reliant on tourism and if anything goes against that, whether economy, weather, bad publicity or in this case, shark attacks, the town could go under. I never labeled this movie as a horror or monster movie. To me, it was an adventure and a suspense movie reliant on one man, an outsider, to battle something that will destroy both the local economy but also the islanders themselves. You get rich history and depth from the Mayor, Ellen Brody, Hooper, (especially) Quint and of course, Chief Brody. Heck, the whole town's inhabitants are rich in character. Honestly, skip the sequels. As a kid, I loved Jaws 2, but as an adult, watching all 4 (so far) films, only the original Jaws was worth watching.",10,2,5,1 December 2012
The Wrestler," Ramming
","If you have a favorite sports star today that you notice might be having a little too much fun, you'd have a good idea what he/she will look like in 20 years  if they're still around  in 'The Wrestler.' A knock-out (no pun, although, not a fan of wrestling, I'm probably off on this one) performance from Mickey Rourke, one of the year's best, make that, one of the best performances I've ever seen. But, unlike 'Revolutionary Road,' 'Milk,' 'Frost/Nixon'  three of the best performance-driven movies of 2008, this one has the pleasure of having an excellent film above the ones mentioned. Again, despite not a pro-wrestling or sports-themed movie buff (especially dislike the based/inspired on a true story/real-events/true events sport-themed, so-called feel good films that ALL BLEND IN), I found myself swept up in the bonding of the sports figures, the ones on the way out and in, the relationship with the fans, and where they end up 20 years after their heyday. Marisa Tomei was excellent as well, as was the 80's soundtrack. And since this is not one of the 'true sports stories' that ALL END THE SAME, it's refreshing to see an original idea, original dialogue, original take on a sport that's generally not taken seriously. I'm sorry to say, if I had been a fan of the sport, I might have even appreciated this excellent film all the more, especially with the dozens of cameos I might have known. But, I still rated the movie the highest, even without the background knowledge and built in fan recognition. Finally, as I said in the opening, this actually applies to all people and a perfect example of the end results to people unwilling to say no to an unhealthy lifestyle. (Myself included.)",10,0,1,5 January 2009
Kong: Skull Island," Come Along with Kong
","At least this KONG wasn't as LONG as Jackson's. If you're just going for the visuals and action - especially in the best 3D I've seen in years, this is the movie for you. Everything worked in that category. Just. It's just...That damn story I couldn't get past. It felt like the entire script was pitched and written on a cocktail napkin...with enough room for the beverage and the story written around the glass. Don't get me wrong, I did have fun and it was great to see a much shorter version of Kong's island retreat (from New York) plus it got RIGHT to the point in the beginning (again, shame on you, Peter Jackson) and it had a wonderful post-credit scene/teaser. SOOO Marvel...without that universe attached. Yet.Would recommend it for a popcorn movie. Just leave your skull at the door.",6,2,5,11 March 2017
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," They Finally Got the Revenge Title!
","And FINALLY, he got it (mostly) right.Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith was the closest film in the mostly disappointing prequels to the original and great trilogy. It also held one of my all-time favorite openings to a movie, in this series or stand-alone films.The film starts with a bang: a 20-minute, non-stop space battle filled with excellent special effects, sound, humor, adventure and suspense. Mercifully, the movie that follows is still pretty darn good. Not perfectyet (stay tuned for IV and V)but the best you're gonna get from the modern (at the time) Star Wars films.This is also the only prequel movie I wouldn't mind seeing a few times; I made a silent vow to never watch I or II again. It's fun, funny, action-packed, has the best FX of the prequels and best of all: it FINALLY connects stories from the original trilogy and this back-story.Now, that said, not perfectly. Maybe the best they could do. Case in point, watch the first four, or I, II, III and IV, in order and they do NOT mesh completely. It's good enough if you suspend your disbelief and call the characters that appeared in both the new trilogy and the old one senile and they can't remember much.I digress. Basically we're to understand that the bulk of the 'clone wars' took place between Episode II and the start of this chapter and it's now winding down. So much so, in fact, that the (sort of) 'good guys' have just two last people to hunt down and either kill or bring to justice and the whole thing is decided. And they do just that.But, they also need to get little Annie into the black suit, the (always terribly written, acted and spoken) love story wrapped up and a half dozen other lose ends to finally put this puzzle in line with Episode IV.I think they did the best they could. Sure, it could've flowed a little better from this chapter to the next one that came out nearly 40 years ago, but from what they were working with, I.E. Georgie Lucas, it was as close as you'll probably get.Unlike the previous films, this one I do recommend. Of course, for first time viewers, I guess I would recommend all (currently) six movies, but if you have already partaken in I and II from years past, this is the best one to get any Star Wars marathon started.* * * Final thoughts: Keep in mind, there's still some bad dialogue and acting: 'Hold melike you did by the lake on Naboo!' to the 'NOOOO!' from Frankenstein's Monster at the end, this movie wants to be great, but has two hands from Georgie to tear it down a few notches. Get past these and a few more 'memorable' lines/scenes and you should enjoy yourself.",5,0,2,6 April 2014
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," White's Right. Right Walt?
","(WARNINGThis is the Adult Disney Review Series. I have 51 Original Disney Cartoons to tackle, plus multiple – and forgettable – direct-to-Disney-Video misses. My goal in 2012 is to brave the task of watching all, many for the first time and commenting on eachall with an adult POV. Now, as soon as I can find an adult to do just that)Ahhh Number one. Snow WHITE and the seven 'little men.' Like Walty Boy isn't trying to say something there. Don't count him out of adding subliminal messages throughout his works. And I'm not just talking about the Little Mermaid's Little Penis. I'm talking even smaller, as in using the phrase here 'Jiminy Cricket' (repeatedly) or his hatred for things, well, not (snow) WHITE.Admittedly, I'm not the hugest fan of this animated film. Sure, it's groundbreaking, for 1937, and against all odds, they made the first (of thousands) of feature-length animated films. Keep in mind: just because a movie's a milestone doesn't mean it equates greatness.Example? Episode IV, A New Hope, formally just plain Star Wars. Sure it was ahead of its time, light-years, in fact, but wasn't it a fraction of the movie, Episode V, The Empire Strikes Back, formally just plain Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back?Why was this, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, not the 'Great' movie tons of critics attribute it to be? Oh, I don't knowbecause there's a lot of racism in here – from mocking the Chinese to the Native Americans? Because the lead singer (and voice) of Snow White sounds like she's sucking on chestnuts (not the dwarfs, I hope) whenever she opens her lips? Or is it the painful pacing?That last one got me. Sure, they wanted to make the first full feature length cartoon, but it still felt like a couple-of-minutes-long short stretched far too long in most scenes. It is said, in the truthful, and masterful sometimes Walt Disney-HIMSELF!, commentary on the DVD, that Walt wanted only scenes that enhanced the character development. Unfortunately, it still felt like scenes dragged longer than they should.I'll give it creativity. It's beautiful for what it was trying to be. It's also VERY adult. There's more than one scene of someone trying to kill someone else. Only, the Queen's evil plan was a little misconstrued. See, she sends her minion (apparently, she's just got one servant) to kill Snow White so the Queen can retain the 'Fairest of them all' status. But then, she spends a good portion of screen time to transform into an ugly hag in order to trick Snow White into eating an apple and fall asleep. Luckily the writers caught the obvious flaw of a cure, but not the fact that there were plenty of opportunities for the witch/queen to simply stab the beauty instead of just putting her to sleep.More things that irate me: Grumpy, apparently one of the 'main characters' – due to a higher amount of screen time than many of the other Smurfs in the movie, is a dick. Plain and simple. Sure, he evolves and Snow White spends a good portion of the movie attempting to get him to like her. But, he's still a nasty character in any lighting. Also, the extremely over-dramatic Snow White is no princessshe never, EVER, shows appreciation for any of the nice things anyone does for her. I.E. the animals bend over backwards to find her shelter. She never, ever offers or says: 'thanks.' The dwarfs care more about her than themselves in many occasions, such as places to sleep or when she 'eternally' sleeps, and when she awakes, it's all about her wishes. Bitch.For die-hard Disney fans, it's a watch. It's not terrible; it's a good beginning and despite its flaws, I'm glad they (and the box office) had faith in Walty Boy to grant him further production deals, leading up to Disneyland, et al. Just don't be proclaiming it the 'masterpiece' that people on the surface call it.Nowonto Pinocchio",5,2,22,3 January 2012
Inception," A Dark Knight's Dream
","Let me begin that I went into Inception with absolute zero expectations. Even though it's been out more than a month – I finally got around to seeing it and I've heard NOTHING but rave reviews, I still – ah hem – cleared my mind before entering the theatre.Let me continue with: I really, really wanted to like this movie more than I did during the viewing. But there were things I simply couldn't overlook and I always have to be honest.#1 As much as I love writer/director Christopher Nolan – to date, he hasn't made a single bad film, talk about a track record! – it almost seemed like he walked off the set of The Dark Knight (TDK) and brought along some buddies to make his follow-up. I spent way too much time saying: 'Oh! He was in TDK. Oh. So was he. And him, and him, too.' This is not necessarily a flaw, as some directors have long-term BFFs. Uh, Tarantino, anyone? But this does lead me to a tragic combo that I simply couldn't get past#2 It wouldn't be so bad if I noticed a half-dozen actors who went from one director's movie to the next, but the Hans Zimmer scoreoh, the SCOREwas sooo TDK that it was distracting. Even the great Danny Elfman, as extremely recognizable he is and similar he is from one project to the next, at least he varies it a tad bit. This was exactly like James Horner's score for both Titanic & Avatar that were so similar, I kept expecting the iceberg to make its way to Pandora. I say all this, as I am a score-enthusiastic; I love a great score and probably listen to those more than most artists. So, while the general public won't catch it, for those who love movie/instrumental music might be a tad bit disappointed.#3 I absolutely admire and desire original scripts and movies that treat creativity as a number one priority. Unfortunately, ten minutes into this movie, I was already tired of trying to put the, well, pieces of the puzzle together. Sadly, you'll have to continue to do that throughout the rest of the feature. Some of the 'plot twists' were easy to pick up and the 'layers' of the dream(s) were extremely easy to follow – the background of each dimension's enough to track. But, I think the extremely well laid out plot was also its undoing. Give it a rest sometimes and stop trying so hard to twist the plot/audience and show the movie.Okay, whew, that's out of the waynow, for the positives.Mark my words: after countless, and I mean more than two dozen Matrix-rip offs in the past decade, this is THEE MOVIE that took Matrix to the next level. In fact, this is the next Matrix, though I hope there's no sequels made here.It was thoroughly thought out, extremely inventive – it HAS to be one of the most imaginative movies I have EVER seen and the action, sound, cinematography and direction were all 100% top notch. This movie should only be viewed in either theatres or on Bluray. I can see it absolutely being nominated for Best Picture, Best Sound and Best Screenplay and quite possibly winning all of those awards.Much like how they describe dreams in the movie (and I do, too – all mine are like this) the movie begins somewhere after the real set up takes place. We have some device at sometime in the future that can tap into dreams. The objective of some is to either 'steal' ideas and/or information orplant information.Cobb (DiCaprio) is one of the best dream masters, and he's being summoned for that stereotypical 'last mission' in order to (HOMER'S ODYSSEY) get home to his wife & kids. Or so we thinkagain and again.So, he takes his normal gang to infiltrate a rich and dying man's son's mind to both satisfy the employer Saito's (Watanabe) wishes, but also so Cobb can see his children again. Their mission involves 'inception' or planting ideas using layers and layers of dreams to make him paranoid enough to...well, see the movie for the motivations. In fact, I left out many of the movie's subplots, especially involving Cobb's own layers and what drives his own actions. Best to leave it up to a new viewer to experience his dilemmas.What a journey it was, from dream layer 1 to 2 to 3 and beyond. Even though one of my criticisms was 'trying to keep up' with the storyline, it is, in fact, a fun roller-coaster ride between the levels, especially Arthur (Gordon-Levitt) who compensates for the variances caused by the upper decks. The best scene involves an extremely ingenious and 'realistic' Cirque du Soleil fight & rescue scene in a The Shinning/Barton Fink hotel hallway.Though every actor did the job they set out to do; only Tom Hardy (as Eames) really stood out – so I wouldn't count on any Best Actor nods. The movie relies solely on story and graphics, and for that, it doesn't let down. A little too much at times, as if it was trying to be so convoluted that it was shooting for a higher playing field than it actually had.That all said, it was very enjoyable adventure with great action, a tremendous number of comedic lines and a fairly good set of dialogue amongst fantastic and exciting backdrops. Highly recommended; there's really no harm in dipping into Nolan's latest dream. And as a side note, I truly believe I will like it more the second trip down this rabbit hole. Until thenthis is what I think.",8,1,7,2 September 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Nothing to Write Holmes About
","I guess I'm thankful for not being exposed to the previous movie installments of the Sherlock Holmes mysteries, as most critics are opposed to how this relates to them. I was able to enter with a clear and open-mind. Unfortunately, I wasn't that impressed.There was a lot to like, however, in 2009's Sherlock Holmes. I've always loved, and probably always will love Robert Downey, Jr. He did a fantastic job in his stab at the brilliant, but troubled sleuth. He did have a lot of low-brow humor, which I favor in films. (You see this mostly in real British humor.) In addition, I am always about the 'Super-Man' characters who know all and barely ever defeated. You'll see a 'super-human' Holmes who can not only do no wrong, but can barely take a beating even when punched.As for the previews, which did NOT in any way persuade me to see this movie, I didn't like how he, in slow motion, hit other men in 'combat.' I loved on how they explained that and what was going on in his mind at the time – the planning and execution. Too bad they only did that 2-3x in the film. And finally, I loved the cinematography, the sets and the feel/look of the late 1800s England.Okay, that's where my warm feelings end. As for the rest, at very least I can safely say: I won't see any more sequels to this. Furthermore, I never want to see this movie again.It was far too long, it was far too forced and though some scenes were well crafted, they were far too spaced out. The movie's set in England and yet maybe one person actually has an English accent. The movie boasts as a 'fun, action-adventure' when I found very little fun, a few minor action scenes and the adventure was just so-so. And the ending? Not to give anything away, the climax has been done so many fracking times, I can't count. Actually, make that, I can. There probably have been as many movies made with this same 'surprise/twist/revelation' ending as there has been years since this movie was set.Holmes (Downey, Jr.) and heterosexual life-partner Watson (Law) are not only crime fighters, but roommates. Well, Watson wants out and in with his soon-to-be wife. Holmes finds he will be lonely without him, but continues on with a mission against a 'Dark Lord' Blackwood (Strong) who kills for sacrifice and apparently can rise from the dead. Holmes is suspicious and works with Watson to solve the political mystery behind Blackwood's ambitions.There, I described the entire 2+ hour film in a few short words. Throw in a mysterious woman (McAdams) who's in the movie as much as Angelina Jolie is in Gone in Sixty Seconds. In other words, less than 10% of the film and there: you have the whole film. Unfortunately, you will also have to throw in a bunch of smelling (literally), wise-cracks, ancient explosions and 'National Treasure' sleuthing.I have to give it to them; it was a unique film, whereas, it wasn't your typical action-adventure that, if made in the 1990s, Mel Gibson would star. But it wasn't anything really to write 'holmes' about. Okay, that was bad, yet, so was the movie.",4,10,18,3 January 2010
The Secret Life of Pets," Another American Tail
","I've had many parakeets in my younger life and boy, now I wish I had a nanny-cam back then.The Secret Life of Pets was a cute, though not 100% original animation movie and even then, I found myself laughing out loud probably more than a dozen times. Not wanting to spoil the movie, but to state my favorite sight/sound-gag, think: TURTLES. Thankfully, most of the jokes were for humans my size, but dang, were they old references. There's a point of gearing a cartoon to please both kids and adults, but this felt like it was written in the early 90s. Eh, still, it made for some great humor and laughs out of me.Apparently, you don't know your pets take on human qualities when you're gone and these NYC apartment building pets know how to party during your work hours. But, there has to be a plot to stretch this from a cute 5- minute YouTube video on the premiseso two dogs go missing and their friends, rebels and more are out to find them.While there is a TON of cool shots in this movie, sometimes a tad overly convoluted, the film is hardly original. I've seen ALL of this before and that said, I still had a great time. There were enough jokes, great animation and adventure to keep up the pace. You can tell, even with the said old script, the animators loved making this film. The details were amazing at times and there was a ton of heart in the making of this. When, in the same year, the lazy and sad production of Norm of the North comes out, it's refreshing to get back to what makes animation greatagain.***Final thoughts: In prep for my favorite month of the year, October, in less than 20 days, I've been catching up on a ton of horror movies. Usually, I can wait and devote the entire month of October to horror, but I just too excited this year. With this, I just needed a break from the gore and glad I landed on this fun intermission.",8,1,2,11 September 2016
WALL·E," Wall-e vs Wal-Mart, guess who wins?
","Too bad, this ninth Pixar feature didn't jump on the 3-D bandwagon until the 10th: 'Up.' 'Wall-E' would've been even better in 3-D. Though, I can't see much to improve on. The story, the character development, the special-effects, the comedy and the message are all top-notch. In fact, this is just another work of art/cinema. As a science-fiction/space adventure, it actually leaves a lot of the live-action movies in the space dust. This one, despite the computer animation, is so incredibly realistic; I thought I was watching real-life scenes. And the best news yet: it's never about the F/X. It's about the story – the essence I always look for when deciding to buy a movie ticket. We live in an era that gives us 'Transformers' (or part 2) that gives us NO SOUL, or script, and we follow along like we're shopping at Wal-mart, sorry, I mean 'Buy'N'Large.' I can't rate a movie that doesn't excel on plot/story/originality. Wall-E does that. He's a compact little machine that's directive is to clean up the mess of a world we made 700 years from now. Until he meets a probe, Eve, that's sent to look for signs of life. Ironically, her mission, or being, in turn gives him life and on goes the adventure when he follows her into space to meet the human (and robot) survivors ready to return once Earth's inhabitable again. In a word, this movie's a masterpiece. Finally, a movie void of almost complete dialogue, you rely on body language and silent love. Rarely does a look show love in movies. In fact, for the most part, we're shoved love down our throats by words. Hardly is it shown with true love. Strangely, we have to turn to robots to open our eyes. Do not miss this movie.",10,1,2,2 July 2009
Arrival," The Day the Movie Stood Still
","Or, Alive on Arrival.The first half of this movie wasn't bad, per se, but it did frustrate me. It showed, once again, how dumb we are. Humans with all its war, ego, greed, miscommunications, short-tempers and small-mindedness. To only take in the first half of this story is proving my point, including my own shortcomings. As a matter of fact, I kept wondering how on Earth did this get nominated for Best Picture?Isn't it obvious by now? Yeah, stick it through to the second half. Some people I know who have seen this state they didn't understand it. Didn't catch the answer to the one question this movie pounds into our head: 'Why are they here?' I do not follow. I don't understand, even with the complexity the second half throws at us, the mission is actually pretty clear.Basically, the movie is about the military attempting to communicate with an alien race of 12 ships that hover over random spots. In comes (the fantastic performance by Amy Adams who plays) Louise and Ian (the normal, expected and welcomed acting job of Jeremy Renner) who work as a linguist and scientist duo to communicate with the aliens. It's not a quick process, especially when they have to deal with different gravity, beings, barriers and, of course, languages. But the military and governments are impatient. I suspect some movie watchers are, as well.Like I made evident, stick with it. It becomes clear and amazing. With as much dirt as they throw at the human race, the movie reveals itself as an eye-opener. I have given too much away. My point is: watch this to the end and let the script tell you a marvelous story. It's slow, unabashedly at times. Maybe a little too realistic. But, it gave me hope that my own secret sci-fi fantasies could come true. Hint: Voyager.***Final thoughts: It's not a movie I would watch repeatedly. In fact, I have no idea (currently, but maybe they do.) when I will see this again. That said, I am super glad I did see it and wish this could really happen. We need this. WE REALLY DO.",9,2,13,27 January 2017
The Blind Side," Blindness
","Boy, The Blind Side tried. It really did attempt to be a tear jerker.If it weren't for an interview I heard/saw from the real-life Michael Oher (played here by Aaron) who said barely a scene actually happened – stating most were for, well, dramatic effect, it still would fail at being 100% interesting.Oher's homeless after his druggie mother (of, like 15 kids she may/may not remember giving birth to) doesn't want anything to do with him, as are the other caretakers, he runs into stuck-up rich wife gal Leigh Anne (Bullock) and she takes him in. Showing she's not perfect, even she admits the first night, she worries a person of color will steal from (or harm) her family. Guess what? Oher ends up being someone decent, albeit reclusive and attaches himself to the rich family's kindness.Eventually he opens up, feels more safe and proves that football's his thing. So much, that the coincidentally ex-cheerleader mom encourages him further and then into a college scholarship. Throw in some outrageously Lifetime drama of a conflict on which school he chooses and you'll get the 'exciting' climax of him making it big on his own terms.These all sound like complaints. And they're really not. This movie wasn't bad, per se, but not great. It tried too hard, way too hard for tears of the audience. I'll admit: it nearly got me in a few scenes.Unfortunately, before I could fully get emotional, the movie shifts gears and I'm back to watching a movie that should have, in fact, ended on the Lifetime Channel verses the big screen.The more I heard about Bullock's performance – Oscar worthy, they say, I had to see this movie. She was really good, I will say. The best? No. Great, even? Again, no. But really good. I believed every scene she was in as mother-of-the-week Leigh Anne Touhy. Was this her best performance? Or the best she could be? By no means, that's a negative. Heck, not only was she better in Speed, her absolute best job was in 2005's Crash, in which, she wasn't even nominated. Like Pacino, who onlyONLY for the love of Petewon an Oscar for one role (Scent of a Woman), Bullock will probably be recognized for The Blind Side, despite her being so much better in Crash. It's those old Oscar cronies way of making up for past mistakes, as they generally do.Was the movie worth watching? Sure. For the (waaay over used) great (based on, inspired by, etc) true FOOTBALL movies? Not really. If you're looking for that, look elsewhere. And having literally hundreds of the 'true' football films come out in the past two+ decades, it shouldn't be hard to find. This one has basically one real football game scene and a few practices. It's more about overcoming prejudices, charity, the 'hood and, of course, Bullock's Oscar chances. See it, if everything else is sold out.SIDE NOTE: Like many other 'TRUE STORIES' that use a tremendous amount of unrealistic but dramatic scenes that, for the most part, are entered in to move the story along to fit in years of lives in mere hours, The Blind Side hit a nerve with me. In one of the key plot points, the young boy of the Touhy family (Head) films all of Oher's football practices and games. He eventually sends a copy to the recruiter's office and from there, every single, and I mean EVERYONE of the, recruiting colleges/universities want this rather large soon-to-be football player. Here's my petpeeve: Though I know, once again, these types of movies thrive on the heavy drama (to make us weep!) and have to get the job done in under 3 hours (short attention span, audience, eh?) they cut corners with extreme amateur videos (the boy was about 10) that are professionally made. For example, he's completely stationary yet, the film follows the action on the field, namely Oher. Not only did this type of filming never occur, it was extremely hard to buy the recruiters sitting back, laughing, high-fiving their way to dollar-signs in their eyes due to the 'excellent footage' they're witnessing on their monitors. Give me a freaking break.",5,9,14,10 February 2010
Rango," NON3D Works
","Quick Review: 'Rango' was mercilessly NOT set in 3D. I don't have a big problem with the brought-back format, but C'mon alreadyit's still just a gimmick. At any rate, 'Rango' relishes in homage to the past Westerns – though it's not technically a Western (too much of a spoiler on why not) – and even then, it's story is really, really old. That said, visually, it's stunning, its attention to detail is that of Pixar-quality, it's hilarious at times and a recommendation for all despite it's too-long running time. Oh, and in spite of the fact it voices one of my all time favorite actors, Timothy Olyphant, they really should've got the real-deal in that great scene. It's a SEE IT. 4/5 Stars.",7,0,0,29 December 2011
The Big Short," Short Sales
","Immediately following The Big Short, I had to watch the movie I hadn't seen in four years, but remember really liking and reminded me of this: Margin Call. So, back-to-back tales of Big Banks and Bigger Assholes destroying America for profit.Sadly, for me, anyways, I understood very little going into these movies and less going out. Focusing on the very different, often attempting to be gravely humorous, The Big Short, I did get the 'Don't Pass Bar' theorywhich is funny I use that analogy, since I understand Craps as much as I do these subprime falsehoods. Basically, a few weird, albeit geniuses, saw what was coming in 2008 – the rug being pulled out from under America and the mortgage crisis. To stay afloat, they bet against the market and all the idiots, fools and incredibly bad humans in the mortgage industry laughed at them and took their bets and money.Sadly, as comically as they tried to dumb down everything for the average schmo, I still didn't get all the terminology and pretty much gave up half way through. I'm guessing the leads of the story were supposed to be our heroes, and since they were scrambling to buy 'shorts' – not the kinds you wear – and since I knew what was coming in 2008 with the housing crash, I just wanted them to get more 'shorts.'The movie was very well made with a great cast you wouldn't see coming if you hadn't seen the poster first.Now, after watching both Margin Call and this back-to-back, I take back that statement: 'the newer one reminded me of the older film,' as they couldn't be further apart aside from the end date. I gave both 4/5 stars and both are very good in their own ways. Personally, I would recommend (and wanna see again) Margin Call over The Big Shortbut just by a margin and it'd be your call.That was bad. My apologizes. Still, see this movie. Especially if you understand all this mortgage mumbo-jumbo nonsense.",8,0,0,2 January 2016
The Conjuring," Top 27 Things They Conjured Up for Us This Time
","1. There's more clapping in this movie than at a Sunday Baptist church service. Hell, the clap-on/clap-off lady didn't do this much clapping.2. Any paranormal story disclaimer of 'Based on the true story' should be accompanied with 'well, if you believe in this sort of thing.' 3. To be fair, maybe the 'true' part was that the Demonbuster Duo believes their own fairytale and did publish it. Sounds like another demonic duo that dreamt up a religion in the mid-1800s and also published it.4. For being thee most 'malevolent' case of the Demonbusters' 1000+ entries, does this mean the inevitable sequel is guaranteed to be less 'malevolent?' Will this 'truthful' disclaimer be on the poster?5. 'So far, it hasn't done anything violent, and that's a good sign,' says Demonbuster Ed. The family must've only had that recently slaughtered family dog they loved so much for only a day in order for them to forget about her so quickly.6. The debate, or inconsistencies within the story, of whether this is a ghost, demon, witchy-woman or Shadow Person, raged on with the contradictions in the script. Suffice to say, don't listen to anything the characters tell you and just know: it's a very bad thing.7. Ghosts – or demons? - who have been dead for a long time start to stink badly. Which makes sense if they rotted, but do 'ghosts' really decay? 8. I know it's 1971, but has anyone really ever cleaned with elbow grease? 9. If I softly close a kitchen cabinet, it wakes my roommate up. And yet, half a dozen picture frames fall hard against the staircase and the sound of shattering glass echoing throughout this house doesn't wake the five timid girls.10. Nor does the mother stepping on the glass loudly.11. Nor does the mother falling down the stairs.12. Nor does the mother screaming.13. Heck, screw this family. She should be the first to leave and alone. Especially when her girls don't hear her from within the house and the returning father hears one of the girls screaming inside from the outside, on the street, 200+ feet away and around a semi.14. Don't fall for the 'it's getting late' excuse from your Demonbuster Duo for hire. Remind them that there's at least five more hours of daylight left.15. As with most of these fictional tales, entities can teleport beyond walls. However, children and dolls still shouldn't be able to. Making this up as you go, eh? 16. Even though it seems like our Demonbuster heroine drops six floors in a two-story home, it shouldn't take five minutes to get to the basement to rescue her. Well, if you don't waste all that time pounding on the walls verses just going to the basement, that is.17. You will only be reminded it's 1971 becauseone character says 'groovy' and The Brady Bunch is on TV.18. Oh, and in the seventies, only the rich could afford flashlights. The rest had to settle withmatches.19. Demonbuster Lorraine's mother questions her daughter's suspicion that her child might not be alright. Has this mother been in the dark this whole time to what her daughter does for a living? Or even her 'special gift?' Have the mother and daughter met? 20. Fear not! This apparently blind demon, who can pass through walls, knock things over, pull sleeping children out of sleep, lead kids astray, possess people, reveal itself when the plot requires it to and turn the Narnia Wardrobe into a nasty place, actually needs to be told where her target victim is hiding. In her own home.21. One of the daughters is dragged across the room by her hair, is saved by scissors and yeteveryone retreats to their rooms to have a good night sleep before finally deciding to leave the property in the morning, several hours later? 22. It was nice to see Chucky's Seed return to theatres.23. Suggestion #1: So they 'can't move out because they'll follow you?' Huh. Well, then, let them follow you into a one room studio apartment with easier opportunities to catch the bastards.24. Suggestion #2: So they 'can't move.' Fine. Forget privacy and take all the doors off. Actually, why do any of these characters have doors when the entities seem to love locking people away from their loved ones? 25. It's pretty convenient that the tape recorder went silent during the family's 'story' of the demon/ghost's activities. Lemme guess: the video tapes also went blank and I suppose I just need to take your word on these 'truthful' hauntings? 26. At very least, it wasn't found footage. But, then again, these movies will make a ton of money anyways due to the seemingly never-ending need for horror-lovers to see the same thing over and over and over. I mean, do you really think this was an 27. original movie? You judge: New family moves into a haunted house cliché. Demon taking a very long time to get stronger, cause havoc and possess someone cliché. Toy ball used as demon plaything cliché. Nearby Demonbuster team and they're available on the spur of the moment cliché. Can't move out of the house because they put all their money into it cliché. Setting up cameras throughout the haunted house to document the entity cliché. Wacky secondary Demonbuster team cliché. 'It must've been a draft' when a door closes on its own cliché. Door opening, scaring people and turns out to be the comic relief character cliché. Ghost wearing a white sheet cliché. Birds attacking haunted house cliché. Expert savior of the day not close, inexperienced hero steps up cliché. Peaceful music at the end cliché. Box office gold for the constant remake cliché.",3,4,10,17 November 2013
Scream," I'll be right back!
","Rule number one: If you have not watched any of the 'Scary Movie' or 'Scream' series, watch 'Scream' first. Rule number two: Watch 'Scream 2' and maybe even 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' then you may safely move onto 'Scary Movie.' I've seen 'Scream' multiple times, but 'Scary Movie' ('Scream's spoof) many more times. It's hard not to laugh throughout this viewing of 'Scream' remembering the hilarious scene-by-scene, line-by-line mock-ups in 'Scary Movie.' That being said, I do remember my first reaction to this movie 13 years ago at its premiere. What a fantastic movie and though it's an homage to previous slasher films (there has to be six dozen references, names, scenes, innuendos in 'Scream') it really reinvented the genre, leading itself into multiple and extremely poor quality rip-offs. In fact, as this brought back the slasher horror and gave it more intelligence, it also brought it back crashing down, harder than before with the horrid carbon copies following. The movie starts with a bang, and the horror references begin early. You think you're watching a Drew Barrymore film, but quickly it shifts to main character Sidney and her group of friends who get picked off one-by-one while everyone's a suspect. Director Craven (loved him as the janitor) has definitely hits/misses (even see part 3 of this series) but his two most influential films – of my generation, that is – is 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' and 'Scream.' While this one's not perfect, it's a real gem, with great comedy, homage, great acting, horror; 'Scream' was an excellent balance of all the right elements to horror-comedy and a perfect teen-night-out. Sure, it's now dated, and teens now probably need a little more (thanks, 'Saw' and other torture porn) but anyone growing up in the genre should appreciate this.",8,0,1,22 October 2009
Prometheus," It's a Thesis, After All
","Upon leaving the theatre for Prometheus, a young girl asked her guardian if there'll be another one. It took all my will power NOT to say: 'Yeah, like 30 years ago.'I'm coming late to dinner, so to speak, by finally sitting down and writing my thoughts out on this Alien prequel (and YES, it is an absolute prequel; don't let anyone attempt to change your mind.) At first, my delay was welcomed – it allowed the experience to sink in. Also, it probably also didn't help I was on holiday in Las Vegas and the last thing I wanted to do was do something that made me think.But, as the days numbered (now) three, probably too much has sunk in. Such as the pros and cons. Above all else, and this opinion hasn't altered, the movie was gorgeous, breathtaking, even. In Director Ridley Scott's long sci-fi career, it's as if he's taken all his ups and downs and produced the nearest to perfect cinematography – well, directed, that is – in his films. The first two-thirds, or so, were absolutely amazing. And I didn't even see it on IMAX, which I should have; I saw it on a screen probably built in the 1970s at some rinky-dink UA on-strip movie theatre off the beaten path.What also didn't change in my mind since I saw it opening day, was the acting of both female leads with Charlize Theron as the best of the two. Though Noomi Rapace did good, I believed Theron just ate up every scene and I thought she had the most depth. Michael Fassbender was okay in his android role – no spoiler there, the original Alien's AH-HA surprise, 'one of these (crew members) doesn't belong' was not a factor here. I didn't have so much of a problem with him, as I did with how convoluted his character was written. And that brings me to the negatives.While the writing, for the most part, was very well done, it did have its moments of awkwardness since it tried to take on too much and introduced tons of avenues. And unless this was written in Lord of the Rings fashion – which it very well could've been, it couldn't possibly have solved, explained or given conclusion to half of the ideas.Director Scott isn't shy of slow-burning his movies to almost a halt at times. With the exception of my favorite of his, Thelma & Louise, his movies are at a snail's pace. Knowing that, I allowed the movie to draw me in and for the first half or so, it did that in spades. I was enthralled with the cinematography, a huge plus for my movie-going experience. However, once the sights were done and the stories went in 5 different directions, the movie slowed and it was almost torture to get to the inevitable and much desired Alien-tie-ins. Of course, you'll have to wade through several endings to get there.The movie, without giving too much of the sixteen or so story lines away, is about the discoveries of a god-worshiping symbol found in multiple, non-connected civilizations roughly 80+ years from now. Taking that, some greedy guy's money (oh, I wonder how that will turn out) and a trip to another planet and we have further questions with what went down in that obviously civilized alien planet.One huge thing that separates this movie and the original 1979 Alien film apart was the writing, the script that I all-but complain about above. The first movie (which I did revisit just last night – I had too, this movie MAKES you want to watch that original Ripley Raid again) was enormously straight-forward sci-fi-suspense-horror. There was not a real shred of originality or depth – even in 1979, but the execution, acting, mood and graphics was what made it so special. Here, in Prometheus, the questions, somewhat answers in the screenplay made Alien look like an infant. This was an adult movie with real profundity.Now, I say I all-but complained about the writing, and that was not my intention; I was just kind of disappointed on how it just branched out a little too much in the final act and that was sadly it's undoing as it had such a great two-thirds of growth slightly squandered in the finale.That said, it's a movie to see. It's not only for true Alien fans, as I am, but it's absolutely amazing on how it can stand on its own without having to ensure you see any of the other ones. In fact, it might be a fun trip if one were to see them all, in order, beginning with Prometheus, without ever seeing the originals.I highly recommend this. Further, don't make my mistake of seeing it on an ancient screen that probably cost less than the monitor I'm using to type this; see it on IMAX. And finally, despite my reservations listed above, it's still an overall exciting, increasing suspenseful (as well as gruesome towards the end) and again, beautifully made film that I wish at VERY LEAST gets a nomination for best cinematography.Oh, and by the way, to answer that kid's comment more accurately following my screening and after my re-watching of the original Alien, I would say there has to be at least one more movie in-between this prequel and the 30-years-later storyline of Alien. Unless, they'll just want to call the minor inconsistencies just basic overlooked flaws.",8,0,2,3 March 2013
Halloween," See the Devil's Eyes for the first time
","Ah, the granddaddy of all slasher flicks. Totally. 'Halloween' is a masterpiece on so many levels, it's a shame the current generation doesn't appreciate those who grew up before, during or slightly after its 1978 release. Obviously, they're used to ghosts with a 'Grudge,' 'Saw' or other torture-porn features, never realizing that despite 'Halloween' not being the first 'psycho-killer' film, it was certainly the most influential. This is proved with the countless imitators in the years that followed, including its own part 'II' and 'Friday the 13th,' which, no secret, literally stated they wanted to make 'another 'Halloween' movie.' 'Halloween' is suspenseful, original, scary and had an excellent theme (thanks, John.) Even with its incredible low budget, there was heart here, characters with real depth and one of my favorite aspects: simplicity. The movie relied on mood vs. gore, violence, nudity and a typical too-long background to explain why the killer Michael Myers is the way he is. You simply accepted he had the 'Devil's Eyes' and went with his passion, stalking and drive. Curtis, 'Scream Queen' #2 (loved the fact she inherited that from her mother) was someone you cared about, wanted to live – something sorely lacking in the movies that copied this movie's success. Halloween 1963: young Michael kills his sister for literally no apparent reason and gets locked up for 15 years, only to return and kill/stalk again. If you get a chance, you must simply watch the TV-version of this classic – it gives more depth to the young boy, Pleasence's (in a career defining/masterful role) plight to keep him locked up for good and Curtis's reasons for being scared. If only real film makers today could come close to capturing what 'Halloween' meant for Hollywood and for movie-goers. This should be taught in film schools. Totally.",10,2,5,18 August 2009
Wonder Woman," Wars of Clay
","Wonder Woman is probably one of those movies to see twice to really enjoy it allbecause this first viewing of mine kinda left me with less than a wonderful feeling.Right off, I am not a fan of slo-mo fight scenes and this movie has tons of them. When Diana (never aka Wonder Woman) is fighting in real time, it's pretty damn impressive and a ton of fun. But, there are those dang (movie) 300 shots of slo-mo that grinds my gears. Next up, the writing felt clunky and directionless at times. The motivations and aim always seemed a tad off. Thisis one of those reasons that I believe it's worth at very least one more viewing now that I've seen the whole picture. And finally, when the action was on screen, sans the slo-mo, it was great but...the action was few and far between. For an over two-hour film, some scenes were tough to get through just to get to the action that certainly paid off.That all said, I did enjoy the movie. Gal did fine as Wonder Woman, sorry, 'Diana' and Chris Pine played his normal shtick – though, he did know his place. You could tell he respected, nicely, whose movie this was: Diana's.Made from clay Diana is raised on (what used to be called 'Paradise Island,' in my book, but in the movie) Themyscira and after what felt like 3 or so combat lessons, she meets WWI-spy Steve Trevor who crashes near her home. Steve brings some unwanted enemies and stories to convince Diana leave her only existence with Steve to stop the Great War for all mankind.The effects, sound, comedy and epic scale all worked. What worked most was the heart of Diana. In one heartfelt/courageous scene in particular, I almost teared up as she was fed up with rules over helping others. As stated, the movie's over two hours and occasionally feels longer, but it does feel like we just bit off the tip of her iceberg. I would want to see more. This is a prequel to her first on screen appearance in Batman v Superman, but like a hundred years in the past. Bring on some more adventures. Let's see her in WWII or some other cold war attacks. Worth seeing. Nothing in it is strikingly bad. There's even a very nice nude scenewell, almost. ***Final thoughts: 10 Best DC Movies, so far: 1. Superman: The Movie 2. Batman (1989) 3. Man of Steel 4. Batman v. Superman: Ultimate Edition5. The Dark Knight 6. V for Vendetta 7. Batman Begins 8. Batman Returns9. Wonder Woman 10. Superman Returns",5,2,17,3 June 2017
Despicable Me," Despicable Me for Not Seeing This in 3D/Theatres
","I admit I didn't like the title, but the trailers to Despicable Me did look like fun. I have no excuse on why I missed it in theatres, but dang, I wish I had seen it there.This was a wonderful movie, all around. Even the movie's shortcomings were overcome. Such as: old story at first glance, but enough twists and personal stamps to make it original and the minions ALMOST overstayed their welcome before the inevitable sequel – like what happened to Scrat in Ice Age: The Meltdown. They didn't, thank goodness, and were kept fresh, fun, entertaining and great to watch through to the end.You may not even like Steve Carell, but even here, in animated voices, he shows his comic genius and absolutely shows depth, much like what Robin Williams did in Aladdin.The world's full of super-villains, as this movie cleverly focuses on, and 'poor' Gru (Carell) is getting older and out-thieved by others so he schemes to steal the moon. Like that's been done before.Unfortunately for him, right when he's getting shut out by the evil bank – what bank isn't these days – and his peers, a new rival appears in the same mold, but creatively different, as Syndrome from Pixar's The Incredibles and three girls come into his life that need adoption. This also sounds like Pixar's Up, but they take it in a different direction.Sure, you know he'll grow to love the girls, but Carell (and the writers, of course – it is animated after all) does a wonderful job of showing the bond grow through deception – he needs them to penetrate his adversary, Vector's (Segel) not-so-secret lair for a device to shrink the moon.It's been awhile that I saw a movie that made me want to put on 'repeat' as Despicable Me did. And it wasn't a one-note film involving the cute and resourceful little, yellow minions that aid in Gru's plight. Sure, they were wonderful, as well, but as a whole, this movie is highly recommended to kids and adults. It's heartfelt, adventurous, absolutely hilarious, enormously creative and leaves you rooting for the bad guy. Let's hope they don't spoil the sequel with twice the number of minions forthere's already hundreds in this one.",9,1,1,8 January 2011
Back to the Future Part II," Are we back?
","Picture it: Phoenix. Saturday, November 25th, 1989. It was early evening at the old UA Theater at Metrocenter. There I sat at the far right of the largest theater, next to the wall since the place was packed, and on the edge of my seat, for the entire length of 'Back to the Future Part II.' See, I was a huge fan of the original, and was thrilled to see the continuation. I wasn't let down. It had action, adventure, 4x the time travel (which originally I was disappointed in #1, since I was a kid that wanted to see time travelers actually time travel), comedy and suspense. I guess the only thing I didn't like, though I did want to see even more when it finished, was the long preview of 'Part III' and the only reason I wasn't thrilled was I didn't like westerns and that's all it looked like to me. This was probably the best movie going experience in my life, before and since – due to the anticipation and excitement of a 15-year-old boy. Fast forward almost exactly 20 years, and after re-watching the entire trilogy, I was kind of disappointed. Sure, it's still a good movie, still had great adventure and comedy, but gone was the original's magic and heart. Too many scenes, characters, events and clues were given specifically to be solved or revealed in 'Part III.' I know it's a classic bridge movie, but it really got tedious attempting to take mental notes of what's to come. The special effects were almost laughable (the first movie came out 4 years prior and still topped this one) and Fox certainly showed his age. Nevertheless, it's a must see for fans, especially since it's required viewing (bridge) to the finish off the series.",6,2,3,5 July 2009
1408," 1408 4 1408
","In celebration of my 1408th review, I had revisit one of the only few ghost/haunted dwellings I can tolerate. (The Shining is the only other one that comes to mind)Since I don't believe in ghosts, haunted houses or any sort of unintentionally hilarious Paranormal chapter, it's generally hard for me to get into them or even be a bit frightened. It doesn't help that 99% of them fall in the same trap of unoriginal material, i.e. family puts all their money into a house they got a great deal on only to be slowly tormented by some variation of the usually angered previous resident blah, blahthey can't afford to move, medium kinda helpsyada, yadathey find a way out at the 11th hour but only to leave the screen door open for a shameless sequel.1408 threw that all out and finally came up with something fresh. Well, in 2007, that is. (Sadly, the 10,992 haunted house movies that's come since said F that! We're going back to the clichés!)Love the story of (pretty much me) writer, Mike – played brilliantly by Cusack, who not only doesn't believe in ghosts, but travels around to debunk the so-called haunted areas in his books. It wouldn't be much of a movie if he didn't finally find one that was actually haunted.The buildup to Mike checking into the title's hotel room was incredible from both Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson. And a ton of what happens in the room and surrounding was extremely effective. (My biggest scare was the ledge, but then, I still don't believe in the supernatural and I'm afraid of heights.)I loved the twist on the haunted story. Wish they'd do more of these original stories – course, it's mostly thanks to the brilliant mind of Stephen King who ALWAYS thinks outside the box. Sadly, America just wants the same old crap recycled at least twice a year. The overkill was tedious four years ago and the unoriginal haunted house stories continue. Laughably, most are supposedly based on true events. Bring back this kind of greatness (and, yeah, the other King masterpiece, The Shining) and I will renew my faith in the washed-up subgenre.",8,0,2,8 October 2015
Raging Bull," Rage Against the Masses
","I only watched Raging Bull finally and for the first time a few nights ago to avoid one of the despised questions critics get asked: 'You call yourself a movie critic, but you haven't seen?!' Truthfully, I didn't have much interest in ever seeing the almost-32-year-old film. I have to be dragged to sports films, like Westerns and Musicals. Although, I generally end up liking them – I loved Chicago, and had to be dragged to that one, too – it's still a chore for me to get started with them.And the nice thing about this film experience is: I knew practically nothing going in. I literally popped in the DVD and pressed play. Prior, I only knew it was directed by Martin Scorsese, starred Robert De Niro, was black & white and centered on boxing. That's it. I didn't know the length – which I love to know for what I'm getting myself into at night. I didn't know if it was a true story. I didn't know it also starred two favorites of mine: Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty. (That last one was interesting; within a period of one week, I saw two brand-new-to-me Moriarty films: this one and Neighbors. Although, it was revealed that I did see Neighbors prior, I was only seven and I only recall blurry memories and that I had seen it.)I like these movie-watching experiences, i.e. going in almost blind. It was as if I saw it for the first time opening weekend, December 19, 1980, before everyone had their opinions, praise or whatever published or spoken.At any rate, I enjoyed this piece of work. The cinematography was superb and crisp. The acting, namely De Niro and Pesci, excellent, as was the score and music. And I believe this statement must have been said countless times before: the direction (by Scorsese) was so masterful, so perfect, this film should be taught in film schools on how exactly to direct a movie.The movie follows Jake La Motta's (De Niro) boxing career from the beginning to (ha-ha) present (in 1964) and we see the absolute rise and self-destructive fall of the paranoid fighter. This time bomb and his nickname, Raging Bull is so blatant in both the ring and in his personal life.Honestly, I could've made that synopsis even shorter, but that pretty much sums it up. There really isn't much story here – it is based on true events, after all – so the movie relies and rightfully so, on the beautiful black & white, mood, acting, camera angles and suspense (for when La Motta will crack for the x time.) And none of these are bad things.Exceptwhen you get into the pacing. As mentioned, since the story is thin, there are far too many stretched out scenes that had already moved past the established 'mood' in the beginning of said scene. For instance, the courtship between second-wife Vickie (Moriarty) and La Motta wasn't just enormously awkward, it seemed to stay on the screen for much too long.Also, I'm wondering if it was a budget thing, but EVERY SINGLE RING La Motta fought in, no matter the city, looked 100% the same, including the spectators, smoke and 'mysterious' darkness beyond rows 5+.Eh, I know that's really incidental to the fantastic and one-of-a-kind shots taken within the ring, namely the best of all fights: the final one between La Motta and Sugar Ray. That one scene was worth the entire time of film.Although it's not a movie I will probably ever see again – as stated: this isn't my type of genre or subgenre, I would still recommend it, especially at over-30-years-strong, it holds up for both normal movie-watchers and film students.Side Note: I don't think I've ever seen Robert De Niro this young, or, hell, even this thin (for the most part of Raging Bull.) So watching him here, I could NOT help but laugh every time I saw him with his sharp and curly hair inches above his head and NOT think of John Turturro (from Rounders.) Literally, for the first half I had to remind myself: this is De Niro, not Turturro.Side Note II: Since I stated, I haven't seen De Niro younggo ahead and ask. Ask the question I hate: 'You call yourself a movie critic, but you haven't seenTaxi Driver?!' Yes and yes. And yet.",8,0,1,3 March 2013
Straight Outta Compton," Not Without A-holes
","The most entertaining thing about this movie for me wasn't actually in the movie. It was the clever memes people put onto Facebook. Mine was: Straight Outta My Mom.Sure, I grew up in the 1980s and 1990s and knew of these artists, but they were never my bag. Never been a rap fan, so I knew very little of their history here. Make that, I knew almost nothing going in, so all of this was interesting from an outsider's POV. That said, my suspicions were correct: There were no good people here. Everyone was pretty much an asshole and contained very little moral ground to cling to. I did, however, agree with their rights to the First Amendment and completely disagreed with those who fought against their privilege to use their talents to convey their messages. The movie, while well-made, is just another run-of-the-mill music biopic. Inspiring artists with no one to back them and more telling them not to continue, finally make it. This comes with costs, tensions, jealousy, contract disputes, make-ups, etc., etc. Mercifully, and delving into spoiler territory, the movie redeems the real-life characters, but sadly by the time the Lifetime Movie moment happens, I've all-but dismissed everyone as bad people. Hell, even when they try and do the right thing, they give their opposition freedom to rightfully slam them. Again, the movie was competently made, interesting and definitely well-acted. Didn't turn me into any fan of rap, or the N.W.A., but it was worth a watch. ***Final thoughts: Either I saw the reader's digest version, or they're not telling the whole story, but it sucks on how much violence they threatened and caused and got away with it. All the way through this, I only stayed in their corner for their First Amendment rights. All the other sh|t they pulled, wellÂ…live by the sword",4,65,151,18 January 2016
The Silence of the Lambs," Hands Down Best Movie of ALL time
","'Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head.' – Jack Crawford.No truer words have been written about the monster, Hannibal Lecter in what I call my FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME: The Silence of the Lambs.I used to work for AMC Gateway on 59th Avenue and Bell Road in Glendale, AZ way back in 1991. I was 16, and one of the perks, was, if you were able to, watching movies at late night prior to movies being released the following day. So, I would say this was February 13th 1991. They did this to make sure the film ran correctly, audio, picture, etc. But, the employees were invited. And it was like a party: only about 10 or so inhabited their biggest theatre. It was a fantastic experience with my peers, as was the movie.Jonathan Demme's masterpiece of sound and visuals rests on many factors: acting, screenplay, sound, mood, surprises, pace, dialogue, suspense, originality, opening, middle and end, comedy, character development, believability, music, score, editing and literal bite. Honestly, I could write an entire hardback on all of these aspects and still have enough for a follow-up publication. In short, this movie worked on all angles. No other movie have I ever seen, in the 1000's I have seen, hit the nail on the head on every single right move on how a movie is supposed to be made upon.In what most people don't know (but it has become more common knowledge in recent years) is the follow-up/sequel to 1986's Manhunter, The Silence of the Lambs begins with Clarice Starling (Foster,) a definitive over-achiever FBI trainee. Immediately into the film, she's summoned by her mentor/soon-to-be boss (she hopes,) Crawford (Glenn) to merely interview the imprisoned 'Hannibal the Cannibal' (Hopkins.) She suspects it's concerning on-the-loose serial killer 'Buffalo Bill' but takes the assignment anyways.Upon meeting, he doesn't just call her out; he sniffs her previous lotion and dissects her innermost fears. Undeterred, the trainee follows the leads Hannibal presents, while previously bad memories resurface and the status of a Senator's Daughter's life is at stake while in the hands of Buffalo Bill. Frankly, she's juggling a lot.All the while, Crawford's actually (and surprisingly to him) impressed and Hannibal continues to taunt – whether to teach, learn, relieve boredom or use Starling, all for his own amusement. Despite his previous free existence's knowledge, before being caught as a serial cannibal/murderer, he's giving her all she needs to 'advance,' or, in turn, catch the killer, Jame 'Buffalo Bill' Gumb.The movie is only the third (at the time) in history to 'Sweep' the Oscars, meaning: it took all five top awards: Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and (adapted) Screenplay. (For the record, I've read all the Hannibal Lecter books by Thomas Harris (all but Hannibal Rising) and I'm definitely in agreeance with that last one. No one could've translated the mood, theme or scene-by-scene as well as screenplay writer Ted Tally did.) Despite the 5 Oscars it did win, it deserved more.Score! Or, the musical background music was amazing and in my top list of all time best scores. Creepy, moody and the perfect sound to match the theme/atmosphere of the film. The soundtrack, or music tracks, such as American Girl by Tom Petty and especially Goodbye Horses by Q. Lazzarus were both not only excellent choices for the film (and scenes) but, personally, they shot to my 'best of' movie music lists. Also, it should've won for editing. This movie was beautifully cut and carefully spliced together. In addition, another award for cinematography was justified, as the movie's photography was eerie, colorful – when called for and truly put you in the character's shoes.You must see this movie. Everything works. It is gory at times, really gory. And I wouldn't like a movie if that's all they gave me. It must contain a story, character depth/growth and true to the story acting. Obviously, I'm going to say this does, and I'd be right.And finally it truly invented my number one favorite villain, Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Sure, Brian Cox already played him in Manhunter and as good as Cox is as an actor, no one could touch Hopkins powerful performance. Apparently he did a lot of the stances, movements, creation of the monster all by himself and it paid off. Thanks to Demme for allowing him to create such an icon. He was scary, smart, deadly and had charisma all in a single breath on screen. This kind of acting job comes but once, generally, to any great actor.Need more evidence that Hopkins did a role of a lifetime? His screen presence was so powerful, he even tricked the audience into thinking he appeared all throughout the film, yet was only shown for under 25 minutes, or less than a fourth of the film. Not the shortest timeframe for an actor to win Best Actor over Best Supporting Actor, but his impact not only impressed the Academy Award voters and audience, but you will truly feel his presence even when he's not on film.This is largely due to the fact on how great Jodie Foster was – another role of a lifetime for her. She carried Lecter's spirit with her when she left his asylum, and on screen, that's not easy. In addition, she was vulnerable and strong, smart and slow, determined and deterred.all of these at the same time. As much as everyone, including myself, focused on how great Hopkins was, she deserves equal treatment on how masterfully she played her part.'I've no plans to call on you, Clarice. The world is more interesting with you in it.' – Dr. Hannibal Lecter.Actually, he's the one that made our world a lot more interesting.",10,2,3,20 February 2010
X-Men: First Class," X-Men Rising
","Those who state X-Men: First Class is the best of the five X-men movies apparently haven't seen any of the first four.Admittedly, it's better than X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and everyone has a right to their own opinion, but come on. This movie suffers from being too long, too much story – for a superhero film, too little relevance and not enough of the exciting X-Men we've become accustomed to.Yeah, I'm aware it's an origin storyyet ANOTHER X-Men origin story (boy, do they like to tell origin stories verses just continuing onward, which I would prefer)but this came off way too much like another unnecessary prequel: Hannibal Rising.I don't want to sound too harsh, because First Class is superior to similarly scripted Hannibal's 'Fun with the Nazis' Early Years. I'm just getting kinda sick of the back stories. In the previous four X-Men films we had bits and pieces of the history of the characters, but none as the exploited and blatant as Wolverine's. While I loved the character of Wolverine, it was refreshing that First Class chose NOT to explore, once again, how he got that adamantium or who created him or why he lost his memory orPLEASE tell me there isn't gonna be a Second Class film. Can you please do present tense? Do you have so little faith in the X-Men that they always have to go backwards and never forward? As much of a Superman fan I am, I would be thoroughly upset if the next four Supe movies deal with life on Krypton and/or yet another Smallville retelling. Move on!Further, in what is beginning to look like the George Lucas Space Saga, we keep going backwards after it began forwards with the original trilogy. 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine is set before the first three and this one, before that. Where are we headed? The 'evolved' fish that leaves the sea and supposedly and eventually becomes man? (Ironically, there is, in fact, a mutant named 'Darwin' in First Class.)That all said, the movie isn't exactly terrible. It absolutely could've been cut by a half hour –or any editing: the movie also suffered from poor editing. But the performances were decent, the 'surprise' visits and homage was cute at points and the CGI/special effects were good.The basic plot revolves around the rise of (the soon-to-be Professor) Charles Xavier (James McAvoy – who, while good, is NOWHERE near the talent or charisma of Patrick Stewart), the revenge-filled Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto (Michael Fassbender, who, AGAIN, isn't close to the performance of Ian McKellen and channeled a bit too much of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine) and the Cuban Missile Backdrop. Meanwhile, good/bad/indifferent/boring – especially the bad – mutants band together to come up with neat nicknames and explore their powers. Somewhat.While I did have fun when Charlie and his pal Erik find other similar mutants and further, when they're being 'trained' while the two leads bicker, the rest of the movie was like a 'based on the series' direct-to-DVD that is for fans-only and could easily only be watched once. I might watch again, but it would have to be a TV-edited version.As for the whole series, I vote for true believers to stick with the originals. X2: X-Men United is still the best, followed closely by the original X-Men. Even though, at first, I didn't care for the third installment, X-Men: The Last Stand, upon re-watching, I actually had a lot of fun during that. (If I had known what was coming, I would've appreciated it even more.)Skip X-Men Origins: Wolverine, for you see his 'origins' in the previously mentioned films multiple times, anyways. And finally, for X-Men: First Class: it's worth a viewing, but it can certainly wait for it to hit home videoand for die-hard fans only.",4,3,12,4 June 2011
Fifty Shades of Grey," Half-Off Discount! The Twenty-Five Things Fifty Shades of Grey Made Me Ponder
","1. I'd really rather watch a movie about Anastasia Beaverhausen. 2. The only difference between this movie and the vampire movie, Twilight, is the lack of fangs. Oh, wait. Neither had any fangs. 3. 'Fvck the contract. You think it's a little redundant, don't you?' asks Christian. Yes. Yes. Yes. And YES.4. Oh, and the two-hour suspense of Miss Wishy Washy's 'will she/won't she' sign the contract is as riveting as watching a bill get debated on C-SPAN.5. I've seen more nudity, sex and fake bondage on YouTube. With the safety function on.6. Considering Anastasia has the mind – and almost body – of a 5-year-old, the police should really look into Christian's porn stash. 7. 'Listen to me: I don't do romance,' says Christian perfectly as this is about as romantic as a hot tub filled with bleach. 8. Confusing an adult playroom with one that contains an 'Xbox and stuff' makes me wonder if the target audience saw this as a double feature with The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge out of Water.9. People might have wondered where Arnold Schwarzenegger was had this kept its original title of Predator. 10. We saw Walter White teach more chemistry in all five seasons of Breaking Bad than the director did to these two 'actors' in this one movie.11. A third grader could conduct a more stimulating interview, even without the use of the internet that seemed to be absent in the college student's research. 12. Laughably, homophobic actor, Jamie Dorman, gets asked by his costar, Dakota Johnson: 'What are butt plugs?'13. There's more 'grey' in this than The Grey. 14. Anastasia's constant excuse for lack of emailing is that her computer is downin one of the most technically advanced cities in the world. 15. 'Seattle? That's where we're going?' is the perfect question to ask someone who you know lives there and is headed homeand you have the brain of algae.16. Too bad Kristen Stewart's clone experiment was a failure. But, on the bright side, if Dakota Johnson continues to 'act,' Kristen might very well be knocked off the top of the worst actress list. 17. It's an insult when you realize this doofus ditz is based on Bella from the Twilight series. And that's saying a lot when you know how awful Bella is.18. Actually, Bella still has the prize as worse on screen chick. Bella's smart enough to use and destroy her many men. Anastasia holds but a tenth of those smarts.19. Really, the safety word should be 'R-Rating' as this was so incredibly safe, it should've been PG-13.20. Anastasia strings Christian for so much of the movie, I almost wanted to tie her up myself. With a noose. 21. At least they perfectly matched the soundtrack with the manipulative lead character.22. Unbelievably, this makes the similarly disastrous Temptation: Confessions of a Marriage Counselor look competent. Score one for Tyler Perry. Sadly.23. I always say, 'To each their own, as long as it doesn't harm another.' Way to go, America, for eating up this horrible crap with unredeemable characters that set women back 90 years.24. It's one thing to be introduced to a bumbling and tripping fool of a character, but for her to go around and around in circles and barely learn a single thing for two hours is just exhausting. But, in the movie's defense, it really does make you want her beaten up by the end. Preferably non-sexually.25. Spoiler Alert! The truly laugh-out-loud, writer-just-gave-up ending was Pretty Woman, but without a climax, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings, but without the yearning for chapter two and The Matrix Reloaded with knowledge of what's coming next. It seriously reminded me of Wile E. Coyote falling off a cliff and holding a sign that read 'How about ending this cartoon before I hit?'",2,8,15,23 March 2015
The Wolverine," Blade Stopper
","My preconceived thoughts, thanks only to the marketing, on The Wolverine involved me rolling my eyes. Yet, another Superhero/Comic Book part 2 (in this case, Wolverine's second solo feature) that our hero loses their powers, the very thing I go see these movies for. Yet another movie I had to count the minutes until the inevitable return of their abilities. Do writers even consider how unoriginal this concept is?Hmmm how many have there been, excluding this one? And what were the reasons?1. Iron Man 2 – Heart problems. 2. The Dark Knight – Wants to retire.3. Spider-Man 2 – Anxiety. 4. Superman II – Lost for love. 5. Men in Black II – Amnesia. 6. Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer – To each other. As some kind of comedy. Kinda.But, I will say this: half way through this incredibly tedious, boring, terribly paced, toned down, un-fun, laughable dialogue and horribly choreographed 'action' movie, I changed my opinion and actually wished my favorite X-Men character's (Wolverine) powers wouldn't return if this was how it was going to go.I understand they wanted to make a more 'grown-up' superhero movie, but still listing it as just that and keeping the PG-13, is a contradictionin this particular case. 'The' Wolverine's really dark – he even drops the F-bomb in this, so if they truly wanted to make it more like an adult adaptation, ditch the too-low MPAA rating. Sadly, that wasn't the only problem the Director failed at.The Walk the Line, Girl, Interrupted and Cop Land director, James Mangold, had absolutely no clue on how to make these characters the very least bit interesting, what makes action scenes – especially in the X-Men universe – exciting or flow right or understood the mythology behind 'the' Wolverine character. Even Hugh Jackman, reprising his role for the sixth time, looked bored and ready to quit. I was, too – I almost took a break during this painstaking long movie and not even ask my friend what I missed upon returning.Oh, and don't get me started on the storytelling from the characters. The endless, relentless and uninteresting childhood stories the characters stop the film every 5-10 minutes to tell us. I couldn't stop laughing when I mimicked the numerous 'When I was very young' stories following the feature to my friend.Basically, the preview gives away 85% of the movie, leaving very little surprises. 'The' Wolverine is summoned to Japan to accept thanks for saving a man during World War II, but not just thanks: the gift of the death to 'the' Wolverine's instant healing and eternal life 'curse.' So, when 'the' Wolverine loses said power, he's shot multiples of times, including dead-center with a shotgun, and he continues on like they were scratches. Will he get his powers back? Oh, gee. I dunno. Maybe. But, he will begin a chemistry-free love affair with a cardboard-cutout chick that had less depth of the width of said cardboard. The movie was practically score-less, music-less, story-less and action-less. Along with the characters so incredibly dull, there was very little of interest here. And like I said, even Jackman looked uninterested and just going through the motions.I wasn't a big fan of Iron Man 3 since it contained a minute amount of action, but at least that had a huge supply of comedy. Even 'the' Wolverine's signature small one-liners seemed to be written by a three-year old and were so predictable, I quoted them (whispered out loud) before he said them during my initial viewing.Oops, sorry: Initial? Probably: only.",2,25,50,26 July 2013
Win Win," Two Wins Don't Make a Wight
","Ever since Juno and Little Miss Sunshine splashed onto the screen and spotlighted big-word-of-mouth indie hits, every small group wants a piece of the pie. Win Win had that feel. Only, as good as it was, it wasn't great.I missed seeing this in 2011, and though it wouldn't have cracked my top ten list, it was still a watchable release.The ever-somewhat lovable, everyday man Paul Giamatti plays a down on his luck/clients attorney Mike who, in order to get some cash, pushes for the care of wealthy Leo (Burt 'anything but' Young) only it comes with a price: a teen wrestler Kyle and his asinine mother, Cindy (Melanie Lynskey.)It's one of those 'lying' stories where you can pretty much guess when the 'lies' start revealing themselves. Mike has to lie about his intentions to his wife and to Kyle, a runaway who has potential in pro-wrestling. And Mike has to grow, as predicted.The movie, while good and contains some decent dialogue, humor and realism, is really justthere. Not bad, by most means, but not powerful. Overall, I liked watching the realistic journey of this man and his kooky counterparts. It's a watch-watch, but not watch-right-now kinda film.3½/5 Stars.",7,2,3,7 January 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," The Fall and Rise and Fall and Rise of the Batman
","He's getting too old for this sh*t. Apparently.I am reminded of Lethal Weapon 4 (hell, Part 3 was the beginning of that series) during The Dark Knight Rises. True, people grow old and weary, but these are fictional characters and that's not what I wanted to see, for Gotham's sake. Likewise, I wouldn't welcome Sean Connery's return as Bond in today's world – I want to see my 'super' hero be just that, not one hobble from retirement and doesn't 'go back for that one final job' cliché.Allow me to explain. In The Dark Knight Rises, many years have passed from the previous installment – although you wouldn't know it with the many flashbacks, Bruce is sequestered and all-but in a wheel chair. Naturally, someone(s) sparks life back into the ancient Wayne and back-from-retirement comes Batman.Now, stating Batman returns (again) is not a spoiler – but this is: don't get used to seeing Batman for too long. He's in barely 10% of an almost 3-hour film. This very well-crafted film with very good cinematography and deep characters – both older, established ones and new ones, is an entertaining character-driven story, but light on both action and Batman.Personally, I like my Superhero/Comic Book movies with the actual Superhero at center stage. Obviously, that wasn't the goal, and so be it. It was entertaining for the other aspects.Bane (a barely understandable and muffled Tom Hardy) enters the realms of Gotham with a mission – and bang while burglar Selina Kyle (a delicious Anne Hathaway) steals various items for (no spoiler, but for very, very weak) reasons of her own. After countless conflicts with practically dozens of character pairs, Gotham is under siege and it's up to a broken man to 'learn to pick himself up' again and save the day.(I really didn't want to give away the majority of the story or spoil any more – but in a nutshell, that's the gist.)While the movie isn't terrible, or bad by most reasons, it's filled with plot holes, pacing issues and a grand minimum of 40+ minutes could have been cut easily. That all said, it's worth a viewing and it was a nice conclusion to the Dark Knight trilogy. Also, I loved Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anne Hathaway and their characters.Suggestions for the inevitable reboot: MORE BATMAN. Oh, and keep a great story with great performances, definitely, but fit MORE BATMAN in there, please. Please.",5,4,9,24 July 2012
Black Panther," He Just Can Wait to be King
","Serviceable. As many positives this movie featured, the one word that popped up in my head constantly was: Serviceable.Don't get me wrong: the movie's good and there's not much to point to that's bad, but stripping away the great cast, incredible world-building universe and special effects, it's the most average origin story.The star and best part of the movie, Chadwick Boseman a.k.a. The Title Character, was fantastic and stole every scene. Granted, I would've liked to see him more in his full-body superhero outfit (you'll see as much of him as the Panther as you did Batman in The Dark Knight Rises. In other words, not much.) But, thankfully, he does carry the feature with his great chemistry with the cast and charisma on screen.As mentioned, the world these characters live in and their mythos was also great to see and unbelievably believable. I knew little to nothing about this comic book's background and for them to set it up so nicely that it became realty, was very welcomed.Also really nice was that this was a self-contained story in a huge universe. Never opposed to other Marvel characters showing up, even just to say: 'Greetings!' but it's nice this stood alone. Of course, aside from the setup, that is.Boseman's T'Challa is still mourning the loss of his father in Captain America's Civil War movie...but, then again, it's only been a week since those events. Nevertheless, he needs to be the new King of his (certainly not a ****hole) nation of Wakanda, he needs to prove himself to his people, himself and his father's spirit and bring in a criminal who's taking a break from Middle Earth, Kong Island and this very MCU. There's much more to the story, but why ruin it?The movie takes itself very seriously and that's an ENORMOUS relief from Marvel's go-to formula: 80% comedies with 20% superheroing, i.e. Spider-Man: Homecoming, Iron Man Three, both Guardian of the Galaxies and Thor: Ragnarok. Those movies relied almost exclusively on humor and so little on what I bought a ticket for. Mercifully, they kept the humor - which was sometimes funny - to a minimum here.This isn't a movie I'd rush to see again, mostly because the main plot is so average and predictable, but it's definitely recommended to see once, especially for all the positives mentioned above. ***Final thoughts: As a favor and quasi-birthday gift to my friend, I agreed to stay and see the two post-credit scenes that I usually hate to waste my time waiting for. No spoiler to the content, but a warning: these were two of the lamest I've seen. The first is something we already knew was coming and the second is something we already knew about. There were no surprises and, AS ALWAYS, they were completely avoidable. They're always available online to see so you don't have to spend an extra 20 minutes in the theatre to see 3 seconds of blah.",5,10,20,18 February 2018
Iron Man," He is Iron Man
","I really wanted to reward one of the best superhero movies with a higher rating than just 8/10 stars, but each time I've seen this (now on the 5th time,) I can't get past the two major flaws and one scene, though incredibly original, I didn't personally 100% care for.Let's get the negatives out of the way, because the positives thoroughly outweigh the minor downfalls of Iron Man. #1: The story is just too damned old, familiar and makes it not only predictable, but very A-B-C. #2: The so-called 'villain' is so foreseen, even for the first viewing, that it's funny they should even put in the 'surprise' scene. The scene that was original, but I'm on the fence with, was the last few seconds of the film. It's hard not to give away the spoiler, but since the trailer for Iron Man 2 specifically lays it out, it's Stark (Downey Jr.) revealing his secret identity.I grew up on superheroes, namely, Superman, and one of my favorite aspects, if not the #1, is the secret identity part. Of course it can be considered unrealistic – uh, glasses and the farm-boy stance hardly makes Superman invisible, especially to his 'incredibly brilliant and reporter' partner. So, I'll give it to Iron Man as it would be hard not to put two-and-two together and they were doing just that in the finale's press conference. But, now the fun's gone and I strongly worry, though still curious, about the direction part two's going to take.Okay, glad that's over. The #1 best thing about Iron Man: Downey Jr. He made this movie. Literally without him, this would be just another run of the mill Superhero film. His wit, depth and incredibly funny one-liners shoot this film up to the top 10 (if not 5) best superhero movies. In addition, Paltrow did a great job (up to her nervous fumbling in the closing) of bouncing very nicely off him, as he did with the robots, as well. Bridges, as much as I like him, wasn't a great part of the film. I wouldn't go as far as to say he was miscast – on the contrary, for the character he played, he did fit the part. But, he was just, well, there. Nothing special. Howard's the same and I'm not sad to see him go for the second movie.Back to Downey Jr. If the opening hilarious 'taxi' ride doesn't grab you with his humor, stance and instant charisma, you might as well turn the movie off. Sure, the action's good, in fact, most of its great, but I strongly believe he made the movie.Stark is an alcoholic, rich, spoiled, womanizing, sarcastic and incredibly smart engineer who heads up his deceased father's weapon company until he gets a change of 'heart' while captured, tortured and forced to break free with the Iron Man 1.0 model. After the initial transformation of Stark (inside and out) the movie plays out like almost every other superhero/comic book origin story – again, with the exception of the phenomenal performance of Downey Jr.Not my favorite superhero – like I said, I like the change the superhero has to QUICKLY go through to save the day and here, like Batman, it's a long drawn out process. (I will say this though, they must've known people might have a problem with that because they made it sincerely interesting, despite time-consuming.) But, they definitively got a new fan here to the decades old hero.I do look forward to #2 as well as any kind of Avengers movie with Iron Man – as long as Downey Jr. plays Stark. I can't imagine anyone else stepping into those 'not-really' Iron Shoes. (I could see them cutting costs on that Avengers movie with Iron Man now played by Freddie Prinze Jr. Save your role-stealing to Jack Bauer. Another character you'll never replace.)",8,2,4,10 January 2010
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Men of Tomorrow
","The Ultimate Experience BATMAN v SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE – ULTIMATE EDITION (★★★★★/5 Stars.) Just a quick recap of what I experienced the night of the BluRay released: biased or not, this was the best extended cut film I've ever seen.While Aliens remains as one of my all-time favorite movies, the Director's Cut added scenes that were pretty good and enhanced the characters. Was it 100% necessary to the overall experience? No. It's safe to watch either cut and enjoy both.I'll probably never see the theatre cut of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice again. And this is coming from someone that gave that version ★★★★½/5 Stars and is my current favorite movie of 2016.This 'Ultimate Edition' cut boosts the theatre cut tenfold, without a shadow of a doubt. Characters were enormously fleshed out, emotions merely touched on before are thoroughly explained and an incredible amount of needed tension/investigations helped the viewing. I saw the original three times in the theatre so it was easy for me to see the difference of larger character arcs, brand new scenes and even a simple one line of dialogue that added to the character interactions. This is not to say the theatre version didn't deliver. On the contrary, I still stand behind my four and a half star rating. These additions (or cuts?) simply made the experience better than I could've predicted.Though I wish they had released this instead, I can fully understand why they didn't. Maybe, like Jonathan Kent in Man of Steel would say: the world isn't ready for this, they thought the risk too high. Perhaps. But, at least we all have it now on home video to enjoy dozens of more times.***Final thoughts: Like I stood behind my theatre cut review rating, I stand behind this five out of five star enthusiasm. BUT there was one thing I did NOT like. The comical fact they added the words 'Ultimate Edition' to the opening credit's title. Seriously? That was unnecessary.Mercifully, I got over that instantaneously when this version flew past my expectations.(The following is my original review of the theatre cut back on 3/24/16)When I was young, Chris Reeve's 'perfect hero' Superman was my world. I idolized him and tried to be the good person he was had he been real. I even rejected any variation I saw of him not being so high on a pedestal. Well, I just grew up.Batman v Superman, or BvS, was so radically different (for both Supe and the Bat) it even completely shifted gears from its 'new' origin story film, Man of Steel. This version of the superheroes and villain was so, ah-hem, alien to me, I loved it. I loved how it was made as both real and comic bookish at the same time. I also loved how there was so much here, so many details and plot directions, it demands a second and third viewing which I will gleefully comply with.It would be completely hard to give away a synopsis without ruining all the twists and turns, but suffice to say, it begins where Man of Steel left off, only, from Bruce Wayne's point of view. And from his angle, it's not hard to understand he's wildly concerned about Superman's great powers. As his suspicions increase, Superman has his own direction on how the 'real' world might view him and his place here. And of course, it wouldn't be a based-on-comic-book movie without someone in the background cooking up their own plot.Honestly, that's as vague as I can be to be fair to everyone else reading. Not to mention, I do need to see it again for my own sake of figuring everything out as there was just so much in this movie I know I missed.I enjoyed the hell out of this. I loved the changes. I loved the new Bat. I loved how Superman/Clark was both updated but with so much of the spirit of the old. Heck, I even loved the new Lex's persona I've never seen before.Even though, in this DC take on the Marvel trend of universes, Man of Steel was first and set some of the foundation, this is the one that is really going expand the DC universe to many more movies that I am going to welcome with open arms.This is just my quick take on this movie. I have a feeling this initial great feeling I had here isn't going to wane; if anything, I think I will even rate it higher with additional viewings as I believe Director Snyder really had deeper meaning I was too blissfully overwhelmed to catch. If you have an imagination to expand on your expectations or preservation of your past, I believe you, too, might love this new direction.***Final thoughts: While the world loves Marvel more – to each their own, I love the fact we didn't have to wait 5-6 movies to get many of the great DC Superheroes to meet. Though I know we have a couple of stand-alone Superhero movies following before the Justice League movie, I am appreciative DC didn't try my patience as Marvel did to get to their group hero film.",9,6,13,24 March 2016
Blade Runner," The Running Blades
","Well, it's time to move out of Southern California for, in SEVEN years, it's gonna be one hell of a hellhole and not a single owl in existence!The gorgeously shot Blade Runner shows a future just shy of 37 years (at the time of release) that 'might' have happened considering the technology progressions back then. But, in reality, maybe these 'advancements' in technology everyone's so worried about isn't moving as fast as everyone fears. Hell, our hero, Rick Deckard, lives on the 97th floor in his apartment building – which isn't the top floor, and I do not believe there to be a building that size yet erected in L.A., let alone in the process now, in 2012, that would take probably more than 7 years. Oh and there are more buildings just like that one. And half-as-tall, fire breathing pipes!I digressthis was a fantastic movie, filled with unique characters, grand sets/designs, a fairly decent score, wonderful cinematography and deep characters – especially, but not limited to, Sean Young, who is NOT a favorite of mine, but probably did the best job of all actors in this movie. Sadly, I avoided watching this movie my whole live – its 30th Anniversary is in less than a month – because after two attempts, I 'felt it was too slow and dark' and turned it off 15-20 minutes in.Well, that was my right, but I'm glad I acknowledged the fact it is, as it is, a slow burner, and that I could move forward to an extraordinary looking and good story.Ricky boy, better known to most as Deckard (Harrison Ford) is a 'kind of' ex-cop, or Blade Runner, brought back into the line of duty – isn't every retired cop in movies? – to trace and find five rogue replicants (of humans) because they're outlawed on Earth in the far-distant future of 2019. Lucky for him, these angry robots don't really have any super-powers, aside from being immune to both hot and cold and they're sorta stronger and they're just as bright as humans are.Of course, the story takes turns, gets complicated and we learn a bunch along the way. And as mentioned, it's a deliberately paced film, so sit back and enjoy both the film noir story unfold and the fantastic shots, both aerial and in new/old buildings.As beautiful as the cinematography and crisp and original as the designs, sets, locations and ideas, sadly the monitors took me back a bit. I had to laugh a bit, because for all they came up with: the flying cars, the space colonies – oh, I forgot to mention that, they're pulling an Aliens before The Company did – and of course, the replicated humans, themselves, no way they could've made any of that using the computers/monitors displayed in the movie that probably heated up too much when PONG was played.YES – I know, that's not a flaw, in fact, that was all they had back then, well, those 'state of the 1982 art' monitors and little patience on imagining what the future computer screens might look like. Heck, if my argument was valid, Director Scott's own Alien ship, the Nostromo, 3-years prior, may never have left the dock considering their monitors were even less sophisticated. So, I wouldn't downgrade the movie for that, I just thought it was funny.At its core, it's the grand tradition of detective stories, it's a 1940's private dick plot set in the future. For 99% of the graphics and ideas, this movie was far ahead of its time 30-years ago and is highly recommended for anyone who hasn't seen it.(SPOILER ALERT – do NOT read on without having seeing the movie) On a side note, I was a tad bit confused with the ending – and I'm not referring to the odd cat & mouse chase scene where our 'villain' strips to his skivvies following him kissing a man on the lips in the segment prior. No, I mean, some idiot person I knew many moons ago spoiled the 'secret' of who Deckard really was. Since the movie, itself, was left wide open for interpretation, I chose NOT believe my person's take, especially after my research following the film. The original author, Phillip K. Dick, did not make Deckard a replicant and therefore, despite all other theorist's ideas and blatant clues left by Director Scott throughout, I chose to believe Dick. (No Pun.)",8,1,4,3 March 2013
Monsters University," M.U.4.Yutes
","It's nice to see a movie with their heart in the right place these days. Though, despite their many, MANY, attempts, it was barely funny at all – I smiled a bit, but only laughed once, Monsters University definitely improved on the original. And that was my least favorite Pixar film until Cars (and eventually, Cars 2) came out.Sadly, the criticisms don't stop there. The movie went on for far too long. This isn't an original story by any measurable means, even when it works. It did not need to go on for an additional approximately 15 minutes to tell the same ole story.But, that said, this probably unnecessary prequel – why not a sequel? Huh – was still a good ride and the messages were literally from the heart and not forced. I had fun and marveled at the incredible graphics on screen. Yet another visually stunning Pixar film.The story transports the main characters of the original Monster's Inc, Mike and Sully, back to college so they can prove themselves as 'scarers.' Along the turbulent way, they have to learn more about themselves and help fellow underdogs achieve potential as well.Again, I was NOT a fan of the original, but I didn't hate on it. I felt the exact same here. But, considering the recent mediocre to very bad Pixar films of late, this one was refreshing to get back to a G-Rated, heart-filled story.* * * Final thoughts: I haven't seen the original, since it premiered in 2001. Never planned on it. Maybe I will revisit to see if I truly felt this installment was actually better, but as it stands, I think it does.",5,1,3,3 November 2013
Casino Royale," Royally the best Bond
","I was definitely skeptical at first upon hearing the departure of Brosnan (and how they got rid of him), yet another reboot, a relatively unknown who didn't look like Bond and even at the title song that didn't match the movie's name (Yes, this isn't new, but the most recent entries, the ones I'm most familiar with had it.) Yet, that all changed when I saw 'Casino Royale' which is my absolute favorite Bond film.I did end up loving the title song (it's also my favorite Bond theme song), the score is one of my favorites – of any movie and Craig did an excellent job at portraying human, (emotional and unemotional,) spy and action hero.It also doesn't hurt that I love poker and even those scenes were exciting, though unrealistic. For example, it maybe one thing to work your opponent all-in with your trip Aces to his three Kings, but the final hand – can't give that away, but the odds of four great hands – all on the final hand dealt – was laughable to me. And ironically enough, most poker movies, aside from 'Rounders,' are a complete bore, so at least this one made it exciting.The only other flaw I could think of was the length; oh, how they could have cut 30 minutes out of this. (SEE: the train and rehabilitation scenes.) Nevertheless, to me, it had everything in, ah hem, spades: espionage, tons of action, beautiful cinematography (including extremely realistic CGI/green-screen, you didn't really think they were up on those cranes, did you?), dialogue, beautiful women, comedy, twists, cons and wonderful worldwide locales. I even loved the immediate and stylish B&W opening which shows some action, followed by the opening song/credits and boom: a thrilling chase scene – my favorite of the many great ones in the film.The movie starts with a bang, and quickly gets Bond his double-0 status. He's quickly establishes himself as worthy of the job and is on the trail of a terrorist banker.Though some might complain by comparing it to previous Bond films, I didn't at all. This is a REBOOT - i.e. a new start. If they just threw in the absent Q and his gadgets, a suped-up vehicle, Bond that flies to the moon or a villain with one golden shoe, it would be a sequel. I know why the rebooted it - the threat of how well made and how profitable the Bourne movies were. I don't necessarily compare them to this film as this is pure fantasy espionage, while Bourne was more grounded in reality.Final note: I'll say it again: this is my favorite Bond movie. And I thought Craig did an excellent job. I didn't grow up on Connery, Moore or even Lazenby. In fact, my first Bond was 'License to Kill' with Dalton, which I really liked at the time. It's hard for me to watch the other Bond movies now, because of two reasons: #1 They're so incredibly dated and #2 I saw all three 'Austin Powers' pictures before I saw my first Connery Bond movie. So, I couldn't help but laugh when I finally saw what Dr. Evil represented. My partner at the time was none too pleased with my laughing at the so-called serious Dr. Evil, er, Donald Pleasence's Blofeld.",9,1,4,12 September 2009
Toy Story 3," Third time's a Charm
","I think the harshest thing I could say about the latest Pixar adventure, or Toy Story movie, for that matter, is even attempting to determine with Toy Story film is the best.How Pixar does it blows my mind. Time and again. Sure, they start with what I consider the number one quality of any movie: story. Character depth and development ranks second for me. Despite all my male-counterparts that simply love action, things blowing up, beautiful women (or people,) etc., fall behind – far behind – the front two. Toy Story 3 has all qualities needed to make a fantastic, adventurous and successful movie for tons of people of all creeds. But it puts both of my favorite staples first: excellent story with (yes, even animated) deep characters. And it's a lot of fun to boot.Starting off with a literal bang, Toy Story 3 sets the scene early that these 'Toys of Owner Andy' love to be played with. It's what they were made for, what they yearn for and it gives them hope and a soul. Unfortunately for them, like the expiration on food, (yes, even Twinkies, thanks Zombieland) kids grow up and out of toys.Will Andy be faithful, keeping his prized Buzz Lightyear (Allen,) Woody (Hanks) or (most of) the rest of his toys, ones adults like me grew up with in Toy Story and Toy Story 2? Kinda.As in usual Toy Story fashion, there are mishaps and the adventure begins! Follow the toy crusaders from this point on from Andy's house to the curb, from the day care of hell to new child's house and so on.I would hate to even divulge in more of the secrets, twists, turns, comedy (and I mean roll on floor laughing humor), suspense or ideas presented. I can't imagine even some movie-goers on the fence that actually 'have to decide' to see it.As equally tough as it would be to rank all Pixar movies – though, I plan to – and rank these Toy Story movies in order, it would be equally hard to pinpoint the best parts of Toy Story 3, aside from to aforementioned great script and characters. But, I'll try.I loved the monkey! Though brief, I laughed so hard every second he was on screen. Furthermore, I loved the other new characters, especially Mr. Pricklepants (Dalton.) I loved the intro. I loved the plan of escape. I loved the Ken 'secret' references. I loved the español. I loved the comity (as found in the other Toy Story movies, but I would say it's most evident in this feature) between the leads, as well as newcomers. I loved the extreme attention to detail, the crispness of the film and the cinematography while never forgetting this is a cartoon. (And to add to that, by far, the graphics and technology has tripled this time around, even though the previous groundbreaking entries were still way above par.) I loved the overall comedy, including the tongue-in-cheek jokes. (I actually found myself laughing hard and out loud at some of the under-the-radar jokes that apparently no one else either caught or cared for. It was a tough and somewhat quiet crowd around me – aside from the annoying and crying kids and their equally inattentive guardians who don't know how to muffle their kids.) I love that as well created and designed it is, this could very well be a stand-alone feature, though it helps to see the first two and it does play homage to fans of the other Toy Story movies. So much so, it's hard NOT to get choked up in the finale, if you can make it that far without getting somewhat emotional.That's just a short list. There's so much wonder and awe and it's jaw dropping that Pixar, or the returning voice talent/actors could pull this offagain. But they did. It's highly recommended, and I would say to see it on IMAX 3-D for the quality and grand scale – like I did, but Disney STILL has yet to shock me with their 'version' of 3-D. I was blown away during the 3-D in Monsters Vs. Aliens, but here, like in Up, it was so-so. Thankfully, Pixar does know how NOT to rely on 3-D as a gimmick. They spend their money on the talent to create everlasting stories, fun and adventures.Side Note: The preceding animated short, one I always look forward to prior to any Pixar film, Day & Night, was pretty good, and inventive, but not great. At least it featured Vegas.",10,12,17,19 June 2010
Before Sunrise," Before the Cameras
","Lucky me. A couple of months ago, I got to experience the entire BEFORE trilogy and not have to wait 18 years to reach the (possible) end.When Before Midnight was released in summer 2013, I had a full day of BEFORE movies and was pleasantly pleased.The first, Before Sunrise, is the only one I'd seen before. A long, long time ago. I really did like it back then, and with this second viewing, I still admired it and loved how it holds up today, 18-years-later. I absolutely loved the dialogue, the originality and especially the camera following these two strangers who were destined to be with each other.The movie starts with the unlikely pairing of an American on holiday in Europe who meets his instant attraction, a French student. Both are on a train, but with different stops and yet, he convinces her to debark with him in Vienna. For one solid day/evening/morning, they literally walk and talk and get to know each other. Of course, they fall in love – so much so, that the 'lust' they thought they knew was relevant at first, wasn't that at all. These two were meant to be together.It takes balls for Director and Writer Richard Linklater to pull off a 105 minute movie based solely on walking and talking and only truly starring two unknowns, buthe pulled it off. The dialogue was crisp, the connection and charisma was present and the originality of such a basic, yet deep, film was refreshing.People in real life only dream about this kind of chance encounter. This may be fantasy, but it's one that many, including myself, would yearn our whole lives for. If you don't get the sense of true love, true connection and true meaning upon the finale of this film, you might want to restart the film.I did laugh, I did admire and I did fall in love with these two. I even loved the ambiguous climax. This was a love story that you'd love to read in a great novel and cherish every moment.Finally, I loved the simplicity of this film. Kudos to Linklater for such a great experiment that worked. If there were no sequels, which are certainly very good on their own, I would be okay with how this movie can stand alone.",9,0,0,2 September 2013
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Vicky and Christina in Borelona
","Here's a word I despise using in reviews: boring. But, I seriously can't avoid describing 'Vicky Christina Barcelona' as just that: boring. Probably because I've never been a Woody Allen fan. Well, you're either a Woody Allen fan or not, an Adam Sandler fan or not, a Jim Carrey fan or not, or even a Stanley Kubrick fan or not. (Personally, only of the ones mentioned, I'm only a Carrey fan, but only for about 70% of his films.) 'Vicky' seems just to be a simple story of two different, but best gal friends on holiday in Spain who both get seduced by a completely lost, and drama-followed painter (Bardem.) We learn of their loves/likes/dislikes and definitely unhappy lifestyles they either are leading or will live. Everyone is lost, unhappy or despicable. Barely a character will think twice about having an affair, a destructive threesome or someone else's feelings. In fact, the only character you feel for, or maybe supposed to care about is Chris, the finance/husband of Vicky, much like John C. Reilly's character, Amos, in 'Chicago'  both Amos and Chris are the only respectable characters/spouses in their movies and both are completely oblivious and naïve. Yet, we get to watch them get lied to, stomped on and kept in the dark throughout. Granted, both title characters did what they could with the material they were given, but the real reason I watched was for all the Oscar buzz concerning Penelope Cruz. Yes, she was good. Great? Not really. My vote still leans towards Marisa Tomei in 'The Wrestler.' And you have to stammer through the first 50 out of 96 minutes to finally see Cruz. Aside from her performance, I'm not surprised no other nominations were handed out. Oh, yeah, they were probably just as bored as I was.",2,25,41,18 February 2009
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Cuss Me for Taking This Long
","'The Fantastic Mr. Fox' is kinda like coffee or smokingI don't think anyone jumps head-first into either. Neither did I. This being my (LONG OVERDO) first viewing, took me awhile to get into the fashion of animation that's completely different than anything else I've seen – including Pixar, normal CGI and Wallace & Gromit. Butwaitonce you do go down this fox hole, chances are it will surely grow on you, make you smile more than a dozen times, warm thy creative heart and laugh out loud. One running gag I loved so much and never got old: the cuss word(s). This movie is weird, and continues that way to the end and I'm guessing we're rooting for the bad guys/thieves – boy, George, he can really make you side with him, even when animated. Oh, and those are not complaints. BIG Thumbs up.",9,0,2,8 January 2012
Speed," Need for (only 1) Speed
","Hard to believe it's nearing 20 years since they released Speed. And it, pretty much, still holds up today.This was just one of the long lines of very good to great movies that starred and was certainly not helped by: Keanu Reeves. At the time, he was the luckiest man in Hollywood, from Bram Stoker's Dracula to Speed to The Matrix. He got to be in the cream of the crop without having to show any depth or acting ability. Perhaps, that's what director Jan de Bont was looking for here: a soulless and cardboard cop and well, there you go.Actually, the real star here was Sandra Bullock and this was her break-through role. She stole every scene, had the best lines and timing and looked stunning. Hell, even Dennis Hopper's juicy and fun Howard 'anything but a' Payne was no match for Bullock. So, if you forget the forgettable Jeff Daniels and Joe Morton and, naturally, whiteout Reeves, the true stars were Bullock and Hopper.They were so good, that even with the great amount of enormously enjoyable action, it's worth seeing just for them two.Speed focuses on disgruntled Payne and when his terrorist plot of bombing an elevator – too bad he didn't pick the one from the terrible Devil movie – is thwarted by the cops (Reeves's Jack Traven and Daniels's Harry Temple,) Payne shifts to road wars. He rigs a bus that, once it hits 50 mph, it will explode if it slows below 50 mph. Luckily, for everyone on this LA bus, when the bus does hit 50 mph, it's navigated by shrewd, albeit rightfully scared, passenger Annie Porter and Traven, who happened to 'catch the bus.'There are rules, of course – this is a 90s terrorist action flick, duh. No one can get off the bus, and Payne wants money for an undisclosed and anti-spoiler reason, or he'll blow the bus. Annie must pilot this bus through the already terrible LA traffic while the stiff, er, Jack figures out what to do.Since the years, and now almost decades, since this came out, this movie's been dissected enough. Sure, there are huge plot holes, some even big enough to drive (or leap) said bus through – even at 50 mph, but if you sit back, leave your brain at the door, you can enjoy the ride. It's campy 90s action fare, and for those of us who loved it back then and still do, this is the movie for us.I will say, I do have one huge problem with this. Okay, maybe not the original, but the sequel. STAY AWAY FROM (anything but) Speed 2: Cruise Control. That movie was a tragedy from beginning to end. And this kind of movie did NOT need a sequel. It was great as it was. Just have fun here and don't take the next bus.",8,0,0,28 September 2013
Live Free or Die Hard," Old Dog Tricks Don't Die Hard
","What better line to describe 'Live Free or Die Hard' (or Die Hard 4.0) than 'You're a Timex watch in a digital age' for 'old' and 'old-fashioned' John McClane. I do admire book (or computer) smarts, a la Justin Long and a band of new-age terrorists. But, honestly, I'll take someone just simply smart, in survival, the streets and in reading humans over someone simply focusing all their talents in one area. I feel that can take you further in life. Enter the perfect reawakening of John McClane 12 years after his last adventure in NYC. He returns to DC (from Part 2) with a new unwilling partner, his young cyber-connection to post-9/11. And speaking of which: yes, the previous films were before 9/11, and were almost blue prints for real life terrorism. This one embraces it. I loved the new script. I loved seeing McClane doing what he does best despite his so-called 'old-way of thinking.' The action was intense, the lines were hilarious, Kevin 'Warlock' Smith was awesome, as was his and Long and Willis scenes, and another great villain from a very favorable actor, Olyphant, who I've admired since 'Broken Hearts Club.' Olyphant's lines were also hilarious, especially when dealing with a certain female hostage. Sure, as any 'Die Hard' film, you'll have to suspend your disbelief, such as when McClane's 'out of bullets' helicopter attack – though, if you let your critic guard down, it was a great scene. Unfortunately, what nearly killed the film was the closing where a single military jet simply destroys a stacked freeway, followed by a leap frog escape, though more believable than McClane's out of plane experience in #2. Other than that, this was the best since #1, intelligent, fun and I hope for a 'Die Hard Already' part 5.",9,0,1,18 May 2009
X2: X-Men United," X-Phobic People must Unite
","As great the original X-Men was, X2 topped it, much like Spider-Man 2 over Spider-Man. They certainly up'd the ante on action, story and character development. And none of that was easy with the increased character/mutant list. Director Singer should be incredibly proud on pulling off what 98% of Comic Book sequels fail at: adding more and yet keeping the perfect balance all the while improving on the original. (Perfect examples are the recent Iron Man 2 and the original sequels to the original Batman.) There are multiple story lines here, but the majority wrap around the increasing war between Humans (and Politicians) and the Mutants. Profession Xavier (Stewart) is juggling a lot on his wheelchair-bound lap: Wolverine's (Jackman) background, Grey's (Janssen) future, Magneto's (McKellen) present, all while running a school, bartering for equality and helping even the guilty/used mutants.Most times, I have problems with multistory lines in movies, especially comic book and definitely comic book sequels (SEE: Iron Man 2 and Spider-Man 3) but here, everything was used to both further the story along and to enhance it by once again using everyone's different personalities and powers efficiently. Every scene was extremely well crafted, there was enough plot and character development for you to root for both the good and the bad.The battles were well crafted, the characters flushed out perfectly and the action intense, even when nothing was happening. In a lot of movies, the actors simply rely on the director to command everything with full trust. Here, it paid off, in dividends, and they seemed to be having a good time while portraying a good story. As a sequel, it was a great pay-off. On its own, it's a great movie. No one should miss this great adventure.I haven't given too much away – one of my Kryptonite weaknesses, so just sit back, enjoy. If the actual premise or the fact you liked part one is your fancy, you will love this feature.",9,0,1,13 May 2010
Thor: The Dark World," Thortal: The Movie
","When the character I was looking forward to seeing the least becomes the best of the bunch, I'm pleasantly surprised. And the second Loki was on the screen, I fell in love with him all over again.Thor: The Dark World also jumped leaps and bounds over its predecessor in regards to CGI and overall look. I actually laughed and shook my head a lot – at the original for its terrible CGI. During this one, I barely noticed a thing wrong with the presentation on screen and that's a good thing, since the first film's disastrous graphics were an incredible distraction.But, getting back to Loki, or who I like to refer to as: Loki Luthor, since he's in every Thor-appearance movie to date, and Lex Luthor was in 4 of 6 (if you don't count 'Lex Corp' in the background of Man of Steel.) It was just overkill and lacked originality. Even though, he was one of the few bright spots here, in this Thor sequel, I might change my mind if he's, once again, in a third Thor movie, or heavens, The Avengers: Age of Ultron.Thor's sorta cleaning up the mess left by his brother in chains, Loki, when the incredibly long intro back-story kicks in, i.e. Thor's long-distance girlfriend, Jane, gets attacked by a 'Spawn from Hell.' Then, he sorta has to clean up that mess with the help from, yep, Loki and the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Leo and Jemma. Oh, wait, make that some characters from the original Thor and one failed comic relief dude.The story's a mess, barely coherent at times and hardly original, pacing and length had me squirming at times, the dialogue's barely acceptable – and the subtitles did nothing to cover up the bad script, the editing's way off and Chris Hemsworth all-but phoned in this Thor. But, dang, that all said, I had a much better time here than the first movie which was way more a mess. Here, in part two, while Anthony Hopkins, Renee Russ and even Natalie Portman did what they could and were entertaining, it was really Hiddleston's Loki that stole every scene and you could sense he was both the glue to the film and the most enthusiastic person to be in this movie.For the some parts, it was a fun and funny ride – I did laugh out loud a few times, only not at the movie, this time around, and it's entertaining for probably one viewing. Noting huge, but definitely a make-up for part one.* * * Final thoughts: I was told there were two 'extra, Marvel-sig' endings during/following the end credits. Come on guys; the movie was long enough as it was and after the second of three endings, pending you're counting the real ending, was actually pretty lousy and not worth the 2 minute wait for that one. I did leave at that point since I knew there was a minimum of 10 more credit minutes. Lucky I did take off; I found out later that thee final ending was actually worse than the first two. Bah!",4,18,32,9 November 2013
Moonrise Kingdom," The Dark Kingdom Rises
","I am awaiting the day one of the greatest and under-the-radar directors of all time, Wes Anderson, finally gets his honors.Admittedly, I've had to revisit most of his previous works more than once in order to appreciate or even understand him. I still have Rushmore to explore once again.Well, with Moonrise Kingdom, a movie I'll undoubtedly see again, I wouldn't need a second viewing forI loved it from frame one.Months from now, when the Oscars are revealed, it's sad that I highly doubt this will win the top prize. Granted, I haven't seen the other obvious nominees, such as Zero Dark Thirty or Argo, but I absolutely loved this wildly and unabashedly original distant twist of Romeo & Juliet and hope it surprises everyone and wins Best Picture.Back to Anderson and his genius for a moment. This movie is filled with kids: bright, young, full of energy and potential, and yet, this is probably one of the few times in my life have I seen spirits flow through their faces and knew it was the director that pulled that special talent out from their tiny depths to the open. You could see it in the boys faces, it was written all over them. They might turn their futures into the next Joseph Gordon-Levitt or Leonardo DiCaprio, but it was Anderson that helped them shine here.The wacky – and believe me, all Anderson fairy tales are – story revolves around nutso islanders of the 1960s trying to keep a small and disfavored orphan, Sam (played wonderfully by Jared Gilman) and an equally disliked young female, Suzy (also played without a flaw by Kara Hayward) from loving each other. Reasons: unknown. Selfish adults.Part of the beauty of this odd fairy tale is the adventures of Sam and Suzy, with the backdrop of a pending monster storm foretold almost immediately in the story, and the diverse directions the landscape and mood takes and never sways from the heart, humor or straight line the story promises it will take us.During that, characters grow, reveal themselves, realism strikes and we genuinely care for the people's outcome even when they don't mesh with how we feel they should act or what they should say.I know I said I wouldn't 'have to' watch it a second time, but sure as shuck, I will. I know there is more depth here that I might have missed, more humor and more realizations I might have overlooked while trying to take in all the beauty of this filmmaking.In fact, I look forward to my revisiting the Moonrise Kingdom. It's an adult kid story that as an adult kid, I want to experience this again and again. Well done, Mr. Anderson. I look forward to you getting the absolute acknowledgment you deserve as of one of the best filmmakers, or storytellers, of any time.--Side Note: As I prepared to create the film review page for my website, I glanced over many film stills for Moonrise Kingdom and I smiled with fondness and felt remorse for neglecting some key aspects. I didn't even touch on the secondary characters – played by the wonderful Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton and Bruce Willis. They all did awesome, as did the cinematographer and both the film's score and soundtrack are to die for. I just had to throw these acknowledgements in because they all made the film well-rounded and I neither forgot them, nor the art created.",9,2,3,11 December 2012
The Producers," Hitler for Hire
","Can you imagine if this was made today, but the play was about ____? And they get upset about cartoons made about ____!(You fill in the blanks. I'm no prude, but some people are wacko about their beliefs. I choose to live!)But, I am trying to bring up a good point. While most of this movie does work today, and I did find myself laughing a couple of times – once really loud, I'd much rather see this in 1967 or 1968 when it rolled out. Though decades had passed by that point, WWII and Hitler, especially, were still fresher in people's minds than almost half a century later.The producers of the title are trying to get rich quick by producing a 'guaranteed' flop of a Broadway play/musicalonly, it's painfully obvious where it's headed.Although I liked the movie, it was a tad short – I definitely feel seeing more the creation of the play would've been more interesting. Plus, it's just not my type of humor. But, that's Mel Brooks. Never been a fan, even though he does get one or two really hearty laughs out of me in each of the movies of his I've seen.While I mentioned it could've been longer, it's quick enough for fans of Gene Wilder to see if they haven't already. That said, and I've only seen a VERY small selection of Wilder movies, it's probably one of my least favorite films and performances of his. ***Final thoughts: And speaking of Wilder, a big R.I.P. to the comedic master. He just passed away earlier this week and I finally got a chance to sit down and explore some of his works I've missed, including this one. Next up: Young Frankenstein. I don't believe I've ever seen it, though I recall hearing the Ritz song many times",5,2,3,2 September 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Forced to Stay Awake
","Despite all the retreaded ideas, non-charismatic new characters, incredibly slow scenes, uninventive battles, one hilariously bad CGI individual and laziest of all Star Wars scores, Episode VII was at least a different movie than the rest.I didn't hate it, but damn, The Force Awakens felt more like a bridge movie, like Attack of the Clones and The Empire Strikes Back before it. I truly felt like I missed the movie in-between VI and VII and spent more than half the time trying to keep up with dozens of character's backstory as well as all the events that led up to the beginning.Backtracking for a moment, the story, itself, is fairly simple and a straight line. So, that, I got. I just couldn't get into any of the characters, new or old, and felt indifferent on whether or not they survived or completed their individual goals. THISis a 180 from all the wonderful and deep characters of the past movies. Yes. Including the prequels.Funny thing is: now I am more looking forward to Episode VIII since this left open probably 20 unanswered questions and directions. In the movie's defense and maybe my problem, I do need to see it again to really get it all in. That said, I have a bad feeling about this (ah- hem.) This movie made me feel like I had to go out and read every Star Wars book and comic and watch all the Clone Wars cartoon episodes I've never seento have a remote clue on where everyone and every plot point fits in. That is part of what made the original trilogy so special: the simplicity and universal offerings for everyone. Here, it's almost like you needed to take a Star Wars semester course at a Community College to be prepared. On a more positive note, there were some cool scenes, one nostalgia moment I liked and some genuine humor I did laugh out loud at. It wasn't ineptly made, but it really didn't need to be in 3-D. In fact, I blamed my viewing on it being so dark all the time on the 3-D, so I will make sure I pick the always better alternative (2-D) the next time.Overall, I guess I might recommend it for Star Wars fans that have not seen any of the original trilogy episodes in 20+ years. The nostalgia slapped in our face, repeatedly, might mean more to them.* * *Final thoughts: NO SPOILERS, I promised myself, so this gripe will be as vague as I can beDAMNITAGAIN?!?! I mean come on; the third time is NOT a charm and is just lazy storytelling at this point.",3,49,72,19 December 2015
RED," Paint This Town RED
","A friend of mine at work had to actually entice me to see Red. And I'm sorry I needed such persuasion to see it, finally.I mean, I love Bruce Willis in an smart action role (SEE: Die Hard or Live Free or Die Hard,) I love Morgan Freeman in anything, even bad films and most of all, I love Helen Mirrenespecially when she holds a gun a third of her weight without a blink.So why did it take me this long? No excuse. I just had so many other movies to see. Now, you shouldn't have an excuse, because Red was just simple 'leave your brain at the door' fun.You can't take a movie like this seriously. It's close to the aspect of 2010's The A-Team, whereas you'll try and rekindle the past while knowing: nothing you see is possible. And that's part of the fun.Ex-CIA agent Frank (Bruce Willis) is wooing a call-center gal, Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) when he's targeted for assassinationbut wait! This is the Bruce Willis you know and love! (If you don't: press stop now. In fact, why the hell did you rent this anyways, if you're not a 'die hard' Willis fan?) He won't let anyone take him down, not even his love (lust) interest, Sarah.So, he rescues her while hired assassin, William (Karl Urban) begins his quest for annihilation of Frank and his soon-to-be crew of retirees: Marvin (a wonderful John Malkovich,) Joe (Morgan Freeman) and Victoria (Helen Mirren.) Not to mention the -gasp- Russian spy Ivan (Brian Cox.)Pretty much the rest of the movie pans out as they're trying to survive – with little help, oh! I love super-human characters in fictional stories – while solving the puzzle of who's trying to kill them and not allowing them to stay retired. And alive.Here's the deal. Yeah, it's unrealistic, I get that. It's a movie produced by the DC Comics crowd, for goodness sakes. But, the weak spot is Mary-Louise Parker's Sarah and her barely unflinching willingness to go along for the ride. She all but almost dismantled the crew or my desire to further watch.Skip over her. I beg you. This is an extremely fun, no-brainer film with actual shocks, twists and even a sadness when one character dies. I highly recommend it, but make sure you leave that deep-thought cap off when you press play. Again, that is, once you realize you are, in fact, a closeted Willis fan.",8,0,1,31 January 2011
Flight," US AAirways
","So, Flight is another movie that made me kinda mad prior to seeing it, thanks to the trailers.From what I remembered – and now, rewatching it, the preview promised action, comedy, suspense, courtroom thrillingand when you see it, you will, indeed, get all thatfor about 10 minutes out of 138. Unfortunately, I was told this fact prior to seeing it, even though I try not to listen or read anything about films I see beforehand, and they were dead on.That said, at least I was prepared. This movie is a big-screen Lifetime Film about addiction first and foremost and the slight background is that action-packed plane tipping scene in the trailer. Oh, and that 'courtroom scene'? Well, it's really not a courtroom and that disappoints me since I do love the very few courtroom movies produced since the birth of cinema.And after I've already wrote, I actually kinda liked the finished product. Perhaps, because I was prepared? Or perhaps, I understand addictionfartoowell.Drunk pilot Whip Whitaker – really, that's his name, and with the star's name, (Denzel) Washington playing him, we got the WWW – takes the pilot's seat to what could be a dysfunctional plane. Sort of like him, I suppose. In order to save the '102 souls onboard,' Whitaker inverts the plane and lands the best anyone could've done.Unfortunately for him, his life gets a lot worse following the crash landing as his defense team (including friends, relatives and attorneys) scramble to keep the alcoholic out of jail for flying intoxicated. Only, Whitaker's not helping at all.Will Whip Whitaker wind up winning or wosing? (Sorry, that was bad. So what if I'm drinking right now while writing this? Ha.)At any rate, I can see why Washington was nominated: he was, in fact, good, but not great enough to win. So that, Oscars, I agree with. And the movie, itself, was a tad bit confused on what it really wanted to be – and I am excluding the misleading trailer. At times, and even leading up to the climax, it threw in unusual humor that really didn't fit the scene or mood. It was almost as if they were trying to get us to side with the fact he might be able to get away with flying '102 souls' while drunk.The movie's a tad bit long with his journey of alcoholism and only really perks in the finale scene that I really liked. Bookmarked, in reverse, that is, I liked the opening and exciting flight inverting. It's the middle part that's not necessarily bad, but doesn't even remotely hold up a second viewing ever.Recommended? Eh. Sure, why not. Have a few drinks, thoughIt is a long film and I do love irony.",5,1,2,21 March 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Anything-But Hallow
","It's well known in my small circle that I'm not an overall fan of the Harry Potter seriesbut damn, what a great finale.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part Deux, or HP7b, was not just fun, exciting and adventurous, but it was a wonderfully written and tight conclusion wrapping up multiples of story lines without over doing it. It's for die-hard fans to pinpoint all the singular references from the previous seven movies. (It helps me that, instead of waiting the year – or in some cases, TWO – in between, I watched them all within 9 days. Yeah, even I had a day off in between)The revolutions in this, including some major character's motivations, were enjoyable and it was nice to finally get the answersespecially after having to sit through an astounding 1,178 minutes of film to get to a conclusion that was foretold from all-but minute one.Basically, I've already given the synopsis, but with more clarity: it's the final (and thoroughly EXCITING) battle between No-Nose and Harry Potter, the boy that livedthrough their first meeting 16 years prior. There will be destruction. There will be deaths. There will be blood. And mercifully, no one spoiled who died, or when, but I actually expected more deaths from more significant characters.In fact, as spoiler free as people were courteous to be, the way they ranted about the deaths in Deathly Hallows, I had it narrowed down to one of two (of the countless) main characters who were going to kick the wicked bucket. I was wrong.At any rate, I had a ball. It certainly was one of the best (and thankfully, was the shortest) of all Harry Potter movies, although if I were to rank them, it would go something like this:1. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix 2. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 3. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 14. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets 5. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban 6. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone 7. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire 8. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Well that concludes, and probably for good, my Harry Potter journey. As much as I complained (okay, RAGED) through some, as much as I got excited in other parts, I did have fun and will be happy I got through all 19½ hours to say, once and for all: I do have an open mind to all cinema. Even ones that aren't typically my cup of British Tea.Cheers!",8,0,1,3 March 2013
Final Destination," Don't Count on the 'Final' Part
","In an agethe late 1990s and early 2000sof the horror revamp (thanks, Scream) comes one of the most clever and original horror/slashers to date: Final Destination. In fact, it was so smart, it was a slasher without a slasher and the main enemy/culprit that you won't see.Nowadays, the character of 'Death' has been mocked pretty heavily, thanks mostly to Family Guy, but here, it's not so nice. Sly, but fair. Invisible, but present.A high school class is headed for 10 days to Paris, only 'nobody' Alex (Sawa) has a pretty descript vision of their plane not making it a few hundred yards, let alone across the world. Awaking, and he really does, his outburst causes some of his peers and one teacher to deplane only to watch his premonition come true before their eyes. And, the FBI gets involved, thinking Alex has something to do with the explosion.Picture it: the year was 2000. The date of release: 3/17/00. Just think if this movie would've been delayed another year and a half. Or even then, if it would be released at all.Anyhoo, each of the survivors are naturally freaked, and when they 'mysteriously' die one by one, Alex relies on his newly found intuition to solve the reasons of the deaths while heavily relying on Clear Rivers (Larter) – love that name, by the way – and Bludworth (Tony Todd of Candyman fame– the perfect choice for the undertaker.)Apparently, there's a pattern, a new one, that is, since Alex stepped in Death's way. Is that a role you'd like to take? Or would you be able to double dip in saving the survivor's lives?The movie, though a little hokey at times, is nearly brilliant for what it is. I remember shouting out, when it first came out, 'FINALLY,' an intelligent horror movie. A thinker. And with a great cast. I would soon grow to love (yeah, I mean LOVE) Ali Larter, although the rest of the cast did what they needed to accomplish. Even Seann 'Stifler' William Scott down played his typical over-the-top performance – but not by too much.The movie was equally shot well, had well-thought out 'death-by-accident' scenes and a good soundtrack/score. It's not too deep, but its fun and quick and tight – what all horror movies should be. Also, it was refreshing to see that the absence of sex, nudity and excessive amount of gore can still drive/sell a 'teen' horror movie.Highly recommended, if you haven't already partaken in Death's plan.",8,1,1,19 February 2011
Rear Window," Eye Spy(in 1954)
","Actually I don't know why I put the '(1954)' up there. It's not like I ever want to see the remake.In my fifth examination of Hitchcock, following Psycho, The Birds, North by Northwest and Vertigo, I would have to say this is probably my least favorite so far. And that said, it's still incredible work here. From the direction to the incredible script to the originality from back then and even today to the acting to the ultimate suspense, everything worked extremely well together.Twenty years before another great director, Steven Spielberg, would achieve giving extras (the town folk in Jaws) living and breathing souls, Hitchcock already mastered it here in multiple and beautifully choreographed apartments and their tenants. Who could argue that Hitchcock wasn't just the master, but he was always decades ahead of everyone else?A photographer on his last week of being in a cast witnesses what he thinks are clues to a murder that may or may not have happened across his courtyard and in an apartment their windows face. No one believes his suspicions at first, but then everyone's on board, with the exception his ex-war buddy turned detective. Was he right? Will he get the evidence he needs since he's wheelchair-bound? Will he ever be nice to his too-good-for-him girlfriend?The movie is so contained and yet so interesting. Only one shot takes place outside of his small apartment and the camera doesn't range outside of the courtyard and into the view of the other apartments from the photographer's point of view. That alone is noteworthy, but Director Hitchcock (and writer John Michael Hayes) didn't stop there. The interactions were spot on, the mystery was believable and it was even fun being a peeping tom right along our 'hero.' Not to mention, I found myself laughing out loud at some of the appropriate comedic relief bantersfrom a movie more than 60 years old. Also funny, maybe it was just me, but I've started and stopped this movie a few times over the past couple of decades. For reasons, I don't recall. But, once I finally allowed myself to carry through to the end, I was, of course, not disappointed. You shouldn't be either.***Final thoughts: Now, I wasn't around in the 50s, but I guess the only thing I didn't buy was how an incredible dame like Grace Kelly would fall for the 21-year-older (who looked even older than that) James Stewart. I guess, to each their own, but he was never really pleasant to her, in addition to the age difference and attractive-scale. Humph.",9,0,1,7 July 2016
The Purge," The Top Twenty-NineThings That Purge Reality
","1. At least we don't have to worry about any of the Congressmen following the 12-hours of The Purge.2. I wonder if The Purge was all prompted by all the Stand Your Ground acquittals to come? 3. So, security is super tight, but not electricity? 4. Be wary of your neighbors: they might be jealous of the fortune that they willingly gave you.5. And after realizing who your neighbors really are, good luck selling that zillion-dollar, built for a family of four, 36,000 square-foot palace in this market.6. America is the only country that does this, and yet no one thinks to leave the country for the days, or hell, hours, surrounding The Purge?7. A security system that's 'not built for worst-case scenarios' probably shouldn't state that in the brochure.8. For 12-hours, people have the right to kill, maim, dismember, steal, destroy, slaughter, rape and yetthey gleefully adhere to a curfew? 9. Kids are so innocent. They feel bad for procrastinators who, for 364 days, didn't think of a place to hide for a mere 12 hours.10. Today: People buy flowers to honor the dead. Tomorrow: People buy flowers to promote death.11. Worried that your peaceful speech won't go as planned to the father of your underaged love interest? Why not get his immediate attention by shooting at him to break the ice? 12. 'Due to the success of the first film, a sequel is in development by Universal and Blumhouse' says the IMDb Trivia. Well, if Twilight did it, why not, America? 13. Pervert children with mechanical half-eaten baby doll cams know the best places to hide. Well, duh.14. Crime does pay in the future: it gets unemployment down to 1%.15. Miraculously, though somehow not implausibly, in less than ten years everyone agrees politically, despite having 'their own opinions' and votes in ONE governing power. Thanks, Fox News.16. Of course, a Plan B never occurs to the top security salesman who doesn't even fully believe in his own product.17. Mercifully, this movie's family has a brilliant son who knows when someone is speaking into a muted camera when that person's mouthmoves.18. During The Purge, you can, literally, get away with murder and, yet, some people still like to wear masks. Oh, and play on tree swings. All for dramatic effect, I suppose.19. Never thank a family that saved your life. Simply stand, be quiet and at the most opportune time, hide by use of a half-melted, red-eyed devil baby on wheels.20. The greatest advancement of technology in the next decade isn't cars, tablets, security or weapons. It's glowing sunglasses.21. Also, speaking of the future, 'equipment' to break into people's secured houses is so highly developed, they have a name for it that we already use today: a truck.22. And I don't think Burning Down the House by the Talking Heads is ever played in the future because, well, why not give your victims some of your precious, few hours bypassing the easiest way in and waiting for said truck? 23. When barely anything has happened yet, multiple facial close-ups with people who look like they're sucking on golf balls has to be a universal sign of fright, apparently.24. Does homeowner's insurance apply to The Purge hours? 25. I'm not sure wasting 12 of the 8,760 yearly hours, doing whatever the hell you want to do, on one house and for one victim, is the best use of your time.26. 'Hide in the basement!' says Dad to his son. Waitthere's a place to hide? 27. A huge arsenal of weapons should be clearly ignored – for the rest of the movie – when multiples of people are bent on killing your family and it's much easier to carry just a handgun. You know, just as a 'precaution.' 28. While it's grand that Hollywood broke from yet another tired 'Ghost-Story-Paranormal-House-Found-Footage-Supposedly-True-Film' clichéd movie, I would've been happier if they had actually hired a writer with an original thought. And speaking of which 29. Why don't these people have a PANIC ROOM available for when THE STRANGERS who attempt to play FUNNY (and HUNGER) GAMES while COLLECTing the victims after entering their beautiful TOY STORY home with CLOCKWORK ORANGE appeal and show that they're THE DEVIL'S REJECTS?",2,13,22,31 July 2013
Pitch Perfect," Almost Perfect
","Almost a year to the day of my first (and late to the game) viewing, I watched this again having purchased the BluRay immediately after that first watch since I loved it so much at the time. Now, while I don't believe I had the same reaction I did a year ago, it was still a ton of fun, funny and had a ton of cute guys I had forgotten about – a big shout out to Treble backup singer #2 (Michael Anaya,) who had zero lines, sadly, but my eyes were never anywhere else than him when he was on screen. Unfortunately, this was his one performance, but here's to hoping to see him again. I digresswhile I had a ton of fun with the great music and dancing, the characters and their dialogue was, in fact, perfect. Fat Amy, Jesse and Gail were all great, but the actress I'm not a real fan of, but completely won me over, was Anna Kendrick (Beca) who just elevated this movie even higher with her hilarious wit and delivery. If you haven't seen thisdo so now. I mean, the sequel's coming out soon, so hip hop to it!",9,0,2,2 May 2015
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Tina! Mother! Krueger! Scream!
","I knew someone who didn't much care for horror movies, but he kept screeching 'TINA!' around me and his partner attempting to either A: scare us, B: simply make fun of the dialogue or both, in A Nightmare on Elm Street. I can say that, nor the movie itself, scared me. In fact, none of the series (so far) 8 installments, including Freddy Vs. Jason, scared me. And that's okay; it wasn't the scare factor that impressed me or kept me wanting more. It was the humor and inventiveness.Growing up, I was a huge fan of the Halloween, Friday the 13th, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Hellraiser and A Nightmare on Elm Street series, or in other words, cheesy 1980s horror/psycho killer films. (Yeah, I know some of them started in the 1970s, but it was the 1980s that made them famous.) The one series that topped all others, even to today, was the Freddy Krueger films.Generally speaking, the first in any series is usually the best one. I.E. Halloween, Hellraiser and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Though I thoroughly enjoyed the original A Nightmare on Elm Street, it wasn't the best and by no means is it a perfect film. But, it set the stage. It took it's predecessors to a new level. Namely in creativity. Which is one of the reasons why I liked this series the best. Well, that and Freddy is the best of all the serial killers in the aforementioned horror franchises.Nancy (Langenkamp) and her high school pals are having bad dreams, and slowly they discover that they're all experiencing the same horrific nightmares about a man in a 'weird hat, red and green sweater and knifes for fingers.' What they don't realize is that even though the dreams are really, really bad, they soon become deadly when Tina (Wyss) is murdered supposedly by her boyfriend during the night.Boyfriend Rod (Corri) is framed and in jail, but the killing continues! The kids, namely future series heroine, Nancy, attempt to put the mystery together while trying to stay awake and find out who this man of their nightmares is.No spoiler here, but it's Willie from the original V series! Okay, it's just Freddy Krueger, known here as Fred. (At least they didn't call him Frederick.) Nancy must rely solely on herself and her instincts to solve the mystery surrounding Fred, why he's in her dreams and stop him. And seeing the people around her, her blatantly drunk mother, her 'dumb jock' disbelieving boyfriend and her angry and overprotective cop dad are all of no use. (Heck, all of the cops should be fired – I loved the hesitant one in the closing when Nancy's going berserk. Hilarious.)I guess why I rated A Nightmare on Elm Street only 8 stars is because of the laughable dialogue, the inconsistencies and irregularities. For example, some things can come out of the dream when captured, such as the hat and (spoiler – someone else) but then the trellis she doesn't even hold onto comes back with her. A feather from her pillow is seen floating but the mirror Fred crashes through survives. Nancy requests 20 minutes to capture the killer and still has time to set half a dozen traps, have a nice mother-daughter talk and fall into deep sleep. And Fred is only supposed to appear when one's asleep; yet, Nancy receives a call from him and the ending blows any of the story's mythos out the window. Literally.I'm not just talking about goofs, as all movies have them, but they set up a premise, a good and original one in a series of horror movies that relied on a masked killer stalking in the shadows. At least they tried here to change the trend. But, unfortunately, they kept breaking their own rules. It actually would've made more sense to have him as a ghost and then all bets are off. (Granted, he's sort of a ghost, but with rules.) As for the dialogue, though some of its iconic by now, it really doesn't hold up. A few years back, I saw A Nightmare on Elm Street in the theater for a one-night presentation. Being a huge fan, I arrived way early to get good seats, but still thought hardly anyone would show up. Well, it completely sold out. And to my surprise, everyone practically laughed all the way though it and it appeared both at and with the movie. I had to, myself. Even though I grew up on the series and loved them, the movie really was silly, namely for some of the lines, acting and characters – Oh, that drunk mother! Alcohol should be part of any nutritious breakfast! I don't think the audience was really criticizing the movie, they were just having fun.Aside from negatives, I am still awarding the movie 8/10 due to the movie being enormously inventive, original, fun and despite Fred(dy) not being in it too much, he was extremely iconic, an instant super-villain. Also, I'm glad it started a cult following since a lot of the sequels explored a lot more and were, in a lot of ways, far superior to this original one. So, it did set the stage, introduced a whole new world and just as Jaws did for swimmers, this one did for sleepers. Only, with Jaws, you could choose to stay out of the water. Here, and in real life, you eventually have to sleep. Maybe for the last time.",8,3,4,2 January 2010
The Matrix," Whoa! I think I just entered the Matrix.
","'The Matrix' should be seriously considered an absolute classic and milestone. Is it perfect, though? No. But neither was 'Star Wars' (1977) and it's considered the same. Both had mediocre at best acting (Mark Hamill and Keanu Reeves must've applied at the same strip-mall acting schools,) yet both were before their times and started a brand new trend in movie-making. Actually, 'Matrix' takes the cake in too many numerous rip-offs/copy-cats, too many to print. However, back in 1999, it was refreshing to see a movie where the action leads the hero into running alongside a wall while shooting and actually gives a reason they can physically do that. Neo (Reeves) is a computer hacker who's being courted by digital heroes he worships while being investigated for cyber-crimes. After being convinced to follow his soon-to-be mentors into the 'rabbit hole' he learns (or more accurately, takes the rest of the film to learn) that the world he was accustomed to is just a computer program, a la 'The Matrix' and the mainframe's using humans as batteries. Bring on the 'Terminator'-type save all humans from technology storyline. However, with strong performances from Fishburne, Moss, Foster and Weaving, incredible action/chases and state-of-the-art special effects (that still hold up today, 10 years later) we have a fresh, exciting, action packed adventure with smart dialogue even with the same ole 'Savior' or 'The One' storyline. The film's biggest weakness, or really only blemish, is Reeves, who once again proves he's the absolutely luckiest actor in history. Most of his big-budgeted movies are really good, aside from him. For example, 'Speed,' 'Bram Stoker's Dracula,' and 'The Devil's Advocate,' were all wonderful films and were all nearly brought down on the horrid (lack of) acting Reeves gives. Despite that, 'Matrix' is an absolute must watch.",9,0,1,14 June 2009
Godzilla," NowThey'll Need a Bigger Box
","Shame on anyone who even comes close to comparing this 2014 updated Godzilla movie to the horrid 1998 Matthew Broderick version. It would be like putting Batman & Robin in the same league as The Dark Knight.So, in other words, forget that tragedy of a mistake 16 years ago. But, do remember Godzilla from the better part of the last century.This is a movie to absorb and recount your feelings following. Definitely followingbecause all the way through it was I disappointed in this or that and that was probably because this was my movie event of 2014 and one I was looking forward to the second that 1998 movie ended. I wanted them to make a serious Godzilla movie. I knew they had the technology (Jurassic Park was half a decade before the 1998 flop) so I wanted to see a real, honest, big-ass Godzilla flick.Once this movie was over, I did realize that they actually did immortalize the series and original from sixty years ago. They captured every element (aside from one) and give Japan a very well-made, apology/make-up from the 1998 movie.What disappointed me during the screening was the lack of SHOW DON'T TELL – the technique I learned as a journalist in school. Consistently, we got the 'Look at what the monster did!' destruction scene, but we hardly got to see it happening. Or, if we did, we saw it on a sad little TV screen. Um, I paid to see this on the BIG IMAX (Liemax, whatever) screen. This reminded me a bunch of the other huge green monster on screen: Ang Lee's Hulk when a ton of the action I wanted to see big was in tiny little boxes. How cuteNOT.Yes, I get this is from the director of Monsters, a movie I really liked. But, there, where he showed his giant creatures rarely, as well, I figured it was because they had no budget. Here, he proved it was for some TELL DON'T SHOW opposite effect.I don't care for this style of filmmaking. I understand there are a bunch of people out there that like their monsters in the shadows, or worse, off-screen, but I do want to see them. Almost always on screen. I could go home to a dark house and pretend there are monsters around every corner and have the same impact. Hell, I'd even save money and time doing so.So, unfortunately, most of the movie is putting together what everyone in the movie is seeing but we'll never. Mercifully, the end climatic battle – no spoiler there, you knew that was coming and expected, made up for 90% of the vacancies in the movie. Backtracking here a bit. Godzilla starts with multiple stories in the past which lead up to our cast of a few humans tracking the events in the story and why we would have a giant beast named Godzilla in the first place. It does twist the original story a bit, but for the most part stays faithful to the core of the legend.Present day arrives and government cover-ups from years/decades past unravel and the situation cannot be contained. Godzilla is on the loose and the world will see his wrath.Absolutely will I provide no spoilers here in regards to the plot, motivations and surprises. But, suffice to say, when all is said and done, i.e. you get to the climactic battle, it IS ALL WORTH IT. Especially, if you've grown up on the Godzilla lore, like I did.Actually, I am a HUGE Godzilla fan while growing up. Saturday morning's 'From Beyond' segment followed the normal cartoon lineups. Heck, even the opening credits to that two-hour TV block was the water waves produced by Godzilla emerging from the depths of the ocean for the very first time.For the structure (and special effects, score and cinematography) they satisfied my need to get the Godzilla film series back on track in America. Unfortunately, there was one bad side-effect on them trying to be as faithful as possible to the source material: a poor line up of humans. The actors, God love them, especially Bryan Cranston, his on-screen hunk of a son, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and the obvious Asian voice of anti-human/pro-nature: Ken Watanabe. They all did what they needed to do on screen. Nothing more. Nothing that made me truly care of any of them lived or died. One can argue these movies don't need to elevate to Oscar performances and I would argue: it couldn't hurt. So, with my disappointment of far too many 'Oh, look at what the monster did!five minutes ago' and lack of depth in the acting, caused just a couple of bumps down in my rating. That said, it's absolutely worth the viewing and I cannot wait to see it again. Now that I know what to expect and any previous expectations are extinguished, I think I might have an even better time with this production. * * *Final thoughts: I am a huge Las Vegas fan. I visit there 3-4x/year and because of this, my friend and I had to laugh when a Las Vegas scene appeared. Not only did they show a devastated Las Vegas Blvd (or 'The Strip') but the scene begins at the very hotel I booked for a mere week away from me seeing this movie: Caesars Palace! Not only that, of its five-six buildings, the one with the most damage (the building was cut in half) as they pan back, is the very building I am staying in – the Augustus Tower.I don't care. Luck is on my side. I'm still going. And even if a giant monster did attack the Strip, then I might have most of the place to myself. Viva Las Vegas!",7,2,5,16 May 2014
Looper," Next Week on Looper
","What horrible timing this movie had. Sure, even though it came out months before the Sandy Hook school shooting, it's still arriving on home video just weeks following the massacre.Looper should have a warning, or at least, a tribute, if they keep with the December 31st release date. Spoiler: (and there might be a few more minor ones – fair warning,) there are scenes where a man hunts down to slaughter very young children. They even show a scene of a very young boy getting shot.Sure, this was made months, perhaps a year, before the Connecticut shooting, but I believe it should be shelved for a bit longer.I digress. My opinion of this 15-subplot film was that I was puzzled it wasn't actually another network 1-season failure on TV. It was amazing that they seemingly fit one Sci-Fi Action/Adventure Drama season of 24 episodes into 2 hours. Since they can do that, that gives me hope for a 24 movie, finally.The movie was all over the place, since they, like I said, fit 2 dozen episodes into 2 hours. It starts off with one bland and clichéd future and speaks worse of another future. The plot holes are wide and before you get a chance to get hung up on those, it shifts to another movie. And another. And another.Oh, and before you think: Well, at least we have our hero to attach onto throughout the multiples of ideas presented, think again. There's barely a character to latch onto. Everyone is an asshole and the only difference between the characters are levels of asshole'ness.Let's see if I can come up with even a basic premise for this random movie: Young Joe shoots and kills future mob trash sent back in time because for some dumb reason, it's apparently harder to bury a body in the future than it is to travel through time.Eventually every 'Looper' must kill themselves, pending they lived long enough to see time travel invented. So, Joe knows he must kill old Joe, and despite what the misleading trailers of the film told us, he has no problem with this. He's just a bad shot, and old Joe gets away.There. I gave you the first of about 14 more story lines to discover. That's the gist of what you'll really need to know. Well, that, and the blah (only in this performance, that I've seen) Joseph Gordon-Levitt either had a digitally re-mastered face to look like old Joe (Bruce Willis) or he's just damn good at squinting for weeks of shooting.As mentioned, this might have worked as a one-two season Sci-Fi show on TV, and it might have been more interesting that way. We might have had more fleshed out characters that we would be more invested in. Perhaps, I wouldn't have thought they were all assholes, or actually believe them when they finally do the right thing.Still, despite all I said, it kept my interest barely enough to complete the loop of the movie. It might be hard for those lost loved ones recently or still in shock of what happened on the East Coast, but other than that, it's a harmless, albeit below-average, flick.",4,2,6,24 December 2012
Casino," A Trusted Gamble
","Talk with most guys, at least ones around my age and they'll tell you they're Goodfellas fans. In addition, or subtraction, they'll also mention Scarface and, no doubt, The Godfather I, II or both. (Laughably, no one ever seems to bring up III without wincing.) Me? I'm gambling Casino will be my mobster movie for all my days.It's a safe bet. Revisiting Casino, for the first time in probably a decade, is like visiting an old friend. And for three hours, it's a ride I can't wait to take again. For, I've done it many times before.I'm not one to like very long movies, or movies that move slowly – and before I go further, this is NOT one that ever moves a bit slowly. But, ever since it came out on video (originally on VHS, back then) I couldn't help myself. I literally watched this three-hour movie over and over. And over. To the point sometimes, when it went to credits, I would insert tape one (yeah, again, VHS, humph!) and start from the beginning.I lovedand STILL DOthis movie so much, in so many ways, it was easy for me to continuously watch it. With this third purchase – VHS, DVD and now, BluRay, I can't wait to plug it to experience it another time.This movie is so near perfect on so many levels and depths, it's hard to sum it all up in one review. The movie's onion layers keep surprising me with each viewing. And it's bonus of two movies in one is fantastic.Movie One, or the first half, is made up of all-but fantastic, interesting and driven narration of how casinos work, the rise of the two best friends/street guys and the mobsters in 1970's Las Vegas. From all my research and first-hand experience, this mentality of the 1970's is fairly close to what it is today. In fact, it's almost dead-on. Naturally, some things do NOT happen today – the place is now like Disneyland: any bad press is VERY bad for the place. So, good luck in smashing a cheater's hands and not having a hundred reporters/bloggers tearing apart your casino the same hour.Movie Two involves every bit of the mistakes these guys made in order to eventually rid Las Vegas of the mob. (There's a lot more to it than from this movie, but for this story, it's centered on these wise guys.) Originally, when I watched this countless times, I narrowed it down to one main slip-up: the firing of a connected relative. But, examining it this time, there were so many nudges to their house of cards, it's hard to add them all up. Each and every bump to the base playing cards had an involvement to everyone's downfall.To top it all off, it's enormously interesting, fun, exciting and suspenseful to see how this well-laid based on true events played out. Oh, and I haven't even gotten to the acting.I never once saw Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone or James Woods (amongst others) on the screen. Ever. These people were truly Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, Nicky Santoro, Ginger McKenna and Lester Diamond, respectively. How each of these excellent performances did NOT win Oscars is beyond me. Actually, while we're at it, how the movie didn't get nominated for, and win, for Best Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Cinematography, Score, etc...baffles me.I digress. These performances were mesmerizing. Each in their own way. All the way down to James Woods, whom I felt did the best of his career and Sharon Stone showing incredible depth.Beyond the incredible feats by the actors was the brilliant direction, cinematography, story, score, soundtrack and pacing. Never did this movie feel slow, nor did I ever 'check the time counter' because it's nearly three hours. The movie just kept going and on the right course. The plot unfolds as it needs to and the recounting of events and voice-overs were just as interesting as what was on screen.This movie was so powerful, as were the performances, that I almost rooted for De Niro's Ace. His gal, Ginger (Stone,) not so much. On a side note, she was fairly despicable and we wouldn't have hated her so much, if not for Stone's great take on her. (Or, again, the weasel, Woods as Lester.)Normally, I would absolutely and readily admit that I love this movie ten times more than the already very good Goodfellas or Godfather series because I am a gambler and have always (since early teens) been infatuated with Las Vegas and its history. It would be obvious that I'm naturally biased because of the reasons just mentioned. But, I am being honest: past my obsession with both gambling and Vegas, I loved this movie on all levels. Yes, it does help that this gives me a much more in-depth view of a certain segment of Vegas' past, I still love the journey Director Martin Scorsese gives me eachand...every time.",10,3,4,30 April 2013
Heat," The Heat is (Back) On
","Whenever the far majority loves/respects/raves about a movie that I cared little for, chances are, I'll give it another shot. I must've missed something, I figure and even after years, or in this case decades almost, I've been yearning to revisit the film. My original thoughts was that it was too slow – which is one dislike I generally have for Michael Mann's films, and that I was thoroughly disappointed in the first ever meeting of two legends, Pacino and De Niro, was a 5 minute scene in a 3- hour film. That's all I could recall of this, except, again, I didn't care for Mann films or Val Kilmer. 2015, almost 2 decades since I've seen this and BOYwas I off. This was a fantastic, interesting and, yes, well paced yarn. Incredibly intriguing, enjoyable action and deep characters. Even Kilmer. While I liked Pacino, I wouldn't count this as his best. In fact, I loved De Niro way better. And his character was one of the best aspects of the film. Incredibly, I wanted him to succeed and get away with it. That, to me, is always a sign of a well-made feature – when we actually root for the bad guy.Certainly, I won't wait another 20 years to see it and only regret I the last two decades I was stubborn to return to the Heat. Mucho recommended!",9,0,2,3 June 2015
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The Only Hope
","What hasn't been said before? Well, nothing from me, that is, until now.I was much too young, or so my parents were to tell me later, to see 1977's Star Wars (Episode IV: A New Hope.) Granted, I was three at the time of release, but I'm sure I would remember at least some of it.Most of my childhood memories of the Star Wars franchise came from the follow-up, Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back. So, basically, my earliest memories would be of my love of Yoda, the main 'spoiler' of father/son and the big walking dogs at the beginning in the snow.Not those weren't great memories – they were, but I was envious of all the other boys (and some girls) around my age that experienced the absolute joy the original Star Wars film gave them.This movie had everything for almost everyone: young/old, adventurous/romantic, Sci-Fi/grounded. So, any boy or girl who got a chance to see this must've absolutely loved it when it was released.Unfortunately, since I was not part of that bracket of 'younglings,' I can only admire it from an older kid/adult point of view.This movie, no matter when you watch it – meaning now, in 2014, or back when it opened, is an incredible landmark in filmmaking.There are movies that change the course of all film history and this one is absolutely in the top five of that list. Jaws, The Blair Witch Project/Paranormal Activity, Toy Story, The Matrix, Airplane! and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs also appear on that list, but Star Wars (Ep. IV) should be on the top or near it. I truly believe this carved a huge section of my generation.I understand this wouldn't have had the biggest of budgets, and in this case, it is a benefit. Case in point: Watch the 'new' trilogy, i.e. Episodes I-III and then this 'follow-up' and see the difference. There are a thousand things/objects/mostly CGI in I-III in each shot and far, far less here. I did just watch I-IV and let me assure you: the simplicity of A New Hope was not only refreshing, but exhilarating. It was this minimalism, whether intentional or not, that made me cheer this one far and above I-III.The story is an age-old one of good vs. evil, heroism, get-the-girl, underdog and David and Goliath. Despite its 'unoriginality,' it all fit perfectly and was understandable for both the very young and reminiscing elders. I don't generally forgive movies that have bad dialogue or poor acting, but when it's called for and it is what the movie needs, it's a necessity. Here it is. Of course, they, or more specifically Georgie Lucas, tried to recapture that for the prequels and failed miserably. It was welcomed here with this story and it shouldn't have gone further into the late 90s and into mid-2000s.At any rate, have you not seen this movie? SEE IT. If you're privileged and lucky enough, do NOT see the Special Edition which throws unnecessary and some horrible shots in – i.e. the unintentionally laugh-out-loud scene with Jabba the Hut. If you can find the original cut, see that. I, and I know I am NOT ALONE, wish that edition would come on BluRay.Until it does, may the force be with you. Always.* * * Final thoughts: Following this (#??) viewing, I just had to revisit my two personal favorite spoofs of this movie: Family Guy's Blue Harvest and the everlasting classic: Hardware Wars. Now, there has been dozens, if not hundreds of spoofs, spin-offs, imitations and homage's to Star Wars (Episode IV,) but those two were absolutely the best – yeah, even better than that mostly unfunny and tedious Spaceballs.I have been known to quote Hardware Wars 10x more in my life than the actual Star Wars. And I am proud of that.",10,0,1,6 April 2014
Deadpool," Drop Dead Hilarious
","Soit's not a remake of the Dirty Harry movie? I wondered where Jim Carrey was.If the incredible open credits for the 'cast and crew,' doesn't grab you, it's best you leave then. I couldn't stop laughing throughout the smart opening and never really stopped to the end. But, it wasn't just funny, it's brilliantly written, refreshingly crass in the goody two- shoe PG-13 superhero movie world and when there was action, it was extremely fun to watch.All thanks to Ryan Reynolds. A role he was born to playuh, more than once, but definitely an improvement.The movie jumps all over the place with the origin and present day stories while telling the story of smartass Wade/Deadpool's journey from almost death to basically immortality. Oh, and despite his gift, he's destined to kill his creator and get the girlback.I really can't wait to see this again. I know I was laughing so hard or marveling at some of the fantastic cuts to both this own studio (à la Family Guy jabs at Fox,) Reynolds' movies and himself and trying to watch both the action and humor to get everything in, in one viewing. And despite Reynolds playing this character before, I knew virtually nothing about him, so it was kinda nice going into this completely cold and leaving completely satisfied.It did help that the internet nearly blew up on the last portrayal of Deadpool. Personally, I didn't know any better when he showed up in X- Men Origins: Wolverine, and still didn't until this full-on origin story began here. I wasn't much of a fan of either the character back then or the movie, itself. I am now.Seriously hope they consider making more Rated-R superhero movies. This one was so great and will do so good at the box-office, maybe they will. See it!***Final thoughts: And speaking of Rated-R superhero movies, I rewatched another one of my favorite superhero movies of all-time last night, Kick-Ass. While I liked that one better than this one, both now are extremely high on my list of best superhero movies. Sadly, though, this one is gonna be tough to beat this year, especially with my personal favorite superhero, Superman, flying back into theatres next month. Unfortunately, I can't see myself liking that film more than this one but who knows. Hopefully, I'm wrong and even though this one was excellent, it only goes up from here.",9,2,10,13 February 2016
Get Him to the Greek," Remembering Sarah Marshall
","Forgive me up front by saying: I truly believe both Johan Hill and Russell Brand might very well be comic geniuses. And this is coming from someone who only liked Brand in small doses, but always loved Hill.Here, in the faux-pas sequel to Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Get Him to the Greek, they're both absolutely hilarious and despite the movie being a tad uneven and overlong, I had a great time with the misadventures of Hill's Aaron Green character who needs to lead his rock idol from London to L.A. for a reunion concert.One Sunday, well, yesterday, I vegged by watching four movies and left this one for last – if I got to it, that is. It appears I did save the best for last, for, I had the most fun during this than the previous three movies, two of which, were supposedly cult comedies.Normally, I would provide a synopsis, but I pretty much already did. Music recording enterprise employee, Aaron, must hand deliver Russell Brand's aging rock star, Aldous Snow, from England to several U.S. cities while trying to deal with both the crazy antics of the druggie has-been Aldous, his own possible ex-lover, Daphne and his eccentric boss, Sergio, played wonderfully by Sean Combs.Like I already reported, the movie is a tad uneven as told with the sometimes directionless plot and clichéd shenanigans, but the basic concept keeps us entertained until the 'big show' that will both further Aaron and Aldous's career.I really did laugh out loud a lot during this movie and was sad that I missed it when it was released almost 3 years ago. It's not a movie I would want to buy, but I am glad I got a chance to see it, finally.I know this is short, but, let me assure you, it is hilarious in most scenes, thanks to both Hill and Brand and all the secondary characters with inside jokes. It's highly recommended.",7,1,2,22 April 2013
Cloud Atlas," Quantum Leaps
","There were more jumps in Cloud Atlas than in a March Madness season, more cuts per minute than inside a Great Clips hair salon – on a busy day and more story lines than in the Bible. What a feat!Too bad, it far-too-closely resembled the terrible movie-within-the-movie in Gentlemen Broncos. Actually, I would rather watch the fictional film within Gentlemen Broncos than Cloud Atlas again.It's obvious this is a LOVE-it or HATE-it kind of film, and if only judged by the Oscar snub and America's Box Office receipts for this, I'm not alone in the HATE-it category. But, to be honest and fair, neither when the Academy completely misses a film or when a movie receives low Box Office numbers, it does not equate bad quality for I've seen plenty of fantastic films that basically made nothing and were rejected on award night. So, without using those to measure quality, I'll let this movie speak for itself on how bad it was.The movie truly had terrible, uninspired and unoriginal dialogue and narrative. Further, the costumes and makeup seemed like they were from a first-year film student that didn't drop out but was kicked out. (I must've laughed out loud a few times with Tom Hanks' multiple of characters and horrendous outfits and makeup.) And while I would normally admire its ambitious drive to cram what could have been a six-part series of films in just shy of three hours, the choppiness of too-many story lines made it feel like the book it's based on had roughly 1,500 chapters, all of which began and ended in under three sentences.Since I won't be seeing this again, I would just have to guess on how many abrupt transitions there were in between the story lines and timeframes. Probably, the same as my estimate number of chapters of the original manuscript. Again, I would normally rate a film higher that went outside the box and leapt all over the place with the different plots, all in a strobe light rapid pace. But, that feeling of admiration pretty much left me 30 minutes in when it all started to give me a headache. Sadly, as the movie speedily progressed, so did the number of sudden edits and transitions.I guess the positive part of all the cramming they did in this, is that it gives me more hope for a Kiefer Sutherland 24 movie. It appears it's possible to condense 24 hours of footage down to about three hours.As for the synopsis, that would be a tough one. And I just watched this film. Well, let's see, there's about 6-7 story lines, many, but not all, star the same actors in different gear and in many different time periods. Supposedly, all are supposed to connect and show a trend/bloodline from the 1800s to the, I don't know, 2500s. And that might be an accurate conclusion to the plot(s), but I either lost interest or was too bored. Even despite the rapid fluctuations of story lines, I found myself thinking of other things I could rather be doing during these three treacherous hours.I got what I needed to out of it. I understood where each was headed – oh, and that's another thing, none of these 6-7 stories had any remote amount of surprise or originality – so, it was easy to let my mind wander.When I did pay close attention, and when I thought: 'Hey, I might actually like this, finally,' they shifted gears once again to more ridiculous and embarrassing characters, flat and completely humorless 'comedy' and the CGI was so bad, the landscaping so insipid, it made 2008's Speed Racer seem more, well, normal. I'm aware who directed/wrote this so it shouldn't be a surprise that Agent Smith pops up quite a bit or that one, sorta main character (meaning, no one really is a 'main character' when there's just about as many characters are there were extras in Braveheart) completely and unintentionally hilariously mimics Neo: Jim Sturgess's Hae-Joo Chang.All in all, I might have to rethink my low rating I gave to The Tree of Life. While that was just as trite as this mess, at least the movie moved beautifully through some good cinematography and score. It was just as long and boring, but at least I had pretty scenery to move me.SKIT IT. Duh.",1,3,12,31 March 2013
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Check (so-so) Mate
","Despite the hundreds of clichés and no-surprises, this mimic to WANTED was actually ten times more enjoyable than that Angelina Jolie flick. The action is fun, the plot is numb and Sam Jackson's lisp is dumb. But, if you can safely leave your brain at the door, the movie works. Namely because of action Colin Firth and assassin Sofia Boutella. The 'lead,' Taron Egerton is a ton cute, but his character – basically a third-tier Captain Kirk from 2009's STAR TREK, was so unbelievable from the get-go, it was too-hard of a sell. Overall, it's a fun action piece that works only because on how silly it is and how much Colin Firth gave Liam Neeson a run for his retirement money.",5,1,6,31 May 2015
Cube," Cubed
","In the pre-Saw independent days of 1998 (actually, released outside of the USA in 1997) was a wildly original and inventive film called Cube. I saw this many years ago and loved it. However, after rewatching it, I feel it definitely deserves a solid eight out of ten stars.Why it lost the full 2 stars (I originally gave it) to drop it to four was just two factors: serious overacting at times and the most depressing finale. No, I won't spoil the climax, per se, but you're grasping throughout the movie for an ounce of hope and need something to pick you up. The rug's pulled, so in a sense, you fall instead of rise.That said, and despite the size of the set the actors are all-but exclusively in, I loved the camera work/cinematography. Unlike Saw with its flashbacks – I think total now 900,000 from the first movie to date (Part VI), this movie shot in the metal rooms had to be a challenge. They did a great job. Also, I love puzzles, and this movie is full of them. Finally, (despite the sequels) I loved not knowing the big picture – I.E. how the characters came here, who built the place. This placed you in more tension like the cast.Several men and women awake in a puzzle of identical 'cubes' or perfect metallic, square rooms, each side (including floor and ceiling) contains a portal to the next, seemingly similar dungeon. But, beware! There are traps abroad and it's these somewhat unrelated and unwilling participants must decipher a way out, room by room. And they must work together to achieve freedom as they start dying off one by one, each in a new and inventively gruesome manner. (I.E. the Saw reference. Saw's writers Leigh Whannell and James Wan must have got a lot of ideas from watching Cube.) As much as the movie contains suspense in spades, I am super glad they decided not to continue the movie past 90 minutes. It's obviously a two set movie (two cubes built side by side) and though they added depth to the characters, they really could only take this so far.For lovers of suspense, claustrophobic horror, character study, numbers (you'll have to refresh on your math skills before or after) and small, indie films with quality, I would highly recommend this movie.",8,0,1,7 March 2010
The Hangover Part III," Overkill's Still Better than the Remake
","Believe it or not, while the Hangover series overstayed its welcome with a part III, it still was 10x the movie the bridge film was. Now, that's really not saying much.I absolutely didn't fully dislike this film. But, then again, nor did I laugh. Hardly at all. Sure, The Hangover Part III was fun, adventurous and got the Wolf Pack back to where they belonged: Las Vegas – if just for a bit. Unfortunately, it just barely had a few lines of comedy. Sad. This is SUPPOSED TO BE A COMEDY. THIS IS A COMEDY SERIES.At any rate, again, it's better than the terrible, atrocity and shot-by-shot remake the second movie was. In fact, it was a little bit of fun I've missed since the first adventure in 2009.Basically, once again Doug is absent for the majority of the film and his friends must track down the flamboyant Mr. Chow for the deadly criminal Marshall who's holding Doug as collateral. They span two countries and try and outsmart the actually-smarter-than-meets-the-eye Mr. Chow to Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.The guys looked tired in this and Zach Galifianakis was the only one who seemed to put effort into his role. They were clearly doing this for a paycheck, and maybe make up for the dud the second one was.It's not a movie to watch more than once. In fact, as I've recommended before, you really should only stick with the first one, which was a great comedy, fresh and fun. No need to venture all the way to part III. (But, if you decide to do that, go ahead and skip over Part II. That movie doesn't even tie in here. Mercifully, so.)Side Note: One of the biggest things I admired about the original The Hangover, was that they got the Vegas scenes right. In too many movies, like 21 and Con Air, the Vegas skyline or continuity to the locations of the movie's characters is way off and anyone who's ever been to Sin City, will know they have no idea what they're talking about when they showcase the characters on the Las Vegas strip. 2009's The Hangover showed us scenes that made me feel I was right there and that's a rarity. Sadly, Part III, went backwards and got the strip all wrong. For example, Stu is driving southbound on Las Vegas BLVD in a crazed chase scene and moments after he passes the Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino, suddenly he crashes into the old strip approximately 5.5 Northeast of his location. This is all fine and dandy for the two people left in the world that hasn't visited Las Vegas. C'mon guys; we're not that stupid.",5,0,1,30 September 2013
Easy A," Olive Branches Out
","Thanks to Emma Stone's 'Olive' Branch, Easy A was extremely easy on the I's. Whoa, OK, never mind. I mean, she made the movie elevate beyond the disaster it could've been.Fine, I have to get over my Zombieland prejudices. I HATED her in that movie. Well, more her character, than her. She was absolutely wonderful here (in Easy A) and sorting through IMDb shows me more projects I've either seen and loved or want to view, such as Superbad, Paper Man, The Rocker, or The House Bunny.Now the movie, itself, isn't perfect on its own, butdamnI would personally vote Stone for a Best Actress (Oscar) Nominee. Heck, if Tomei can get the award for My Cousin Vinny or Cusack nominated for In & Out, Stone EARNED the nomination here.Okay, let's forget Stone for a moment. The supporting cast (Kudrow, why did you have to wait until half the movie's over to show up?), the cinematography and the dialogue were all good here in Easy A, a veryVERYloose adaption of The Scarlet Letterbut let's face it: Stone's witty comments and delivery gave this old concept a fresh perspective.Olive (Stone – Oh! I get it) is the 'little miss sunshine' of her high school until one lie to her BFF of getting out of a weekend engagement blossoms into her having (GASP!) sex with an older man. Well, far be it from (100% unrealistic) kids who will judge, envy or mock (or all three) Olive. Unrealistic, as in, a LOT of kids have sex in high school. Sorry, Leave it to (their) Beaver parents. It does, in fact, happen.Anyways, in this fantasy world, no teen has sex, so Olive's immediately branded as a harlot. She does (& doesn't) care so much, until people catch on, like her other BFF, gay guy friend Brandon (Byrd). A lot of people will look down upon his 'acting straight' to get through high school as 'lying' but let me set the record, uh, straightuntil homophobia goes bye-bye with the back of the bus, it's best to fly under the radar until college. This is coming from experience.I digressHe gets a laid reputation which is followed by others (enter 'fat' stereotypes here) who want the attention until her lie snowballs uncontrollably. Will she do the right thing? Well, time will tell in this John Hughes update. Not coincidentally, the late (and definitely GREAT) Hughes is mentioned here.As I've shined more than once, Stone is both the centerpiece and also the glue that holds everything together. She alone didn't make 100% the movie – give it up to a great performance from Clarkson and Tucci as the (somewhat) clueless parents – but she really nailed the lines in an unrealistic film (mainly in the out-of-left field never-would-happen finale.)I've mentioned this is loosely based on The Scarlet Letter film/work, and even though it's mentioned throughout (SEE: her 'Laverne' A on the clothes) it's never actually about adultery. In fact, she never commits (in the fantasy or real world) adultery. In any case, it's worth watching for some quick and fun dialogue – too many very good lines to quote. I'm surprised to like such a film, but again, it's all about the Stone. Look forward to seeing more of you!",8,0,0,21 December 2010
Fast Five," The Top Twenty-Seven Things I Took From Fast Five
","1. There was enough testosterone in Fast Five for me to get married and divorced three times, due to dozens of affairsall with women.2. To even use the phrase 'Leave Your Brain at the Door' to describe this movie is like describing Phoenix, AZ as hot.3. They gave The Rock a goatee so you can tell the difference between him and the other meathead.4. The group-heist scheme was so juvenile, even Danny Ocean would call them amateurs.5. Of course, they left it open for a sequel, which, no doubt, should be called The Fastisix.6. Pregnant women that leap from two stories and crash through the roof of a structure should at very least get a spot on the next Planned Parenthood promotional video.7. What comes after the following series of battles? King Kong Vs. Godzilla; Freddy Vs. Jason; Alien Vs. Predator; Pacino Vs. De Niro..uh, Dwayne Vs. Diesel? 8. Not everyone likes sequels being made. But, I'm sure as hell Paul Walker does.9. The movie's not going to be considered for Best Picture anyways, so I hope they fired whoever made the decision to delete the scenes that the series is known for – racing cars to win other fast cars.10. Thankfully, EBay sells everything, including an entire, full-size vault, exactly like the one you plan on robbing. Heck, in one click, you can get it delivered in hours. To Rio, no less.11. The movie opened in April 2011 to $86 million which spun Hollywood Honcho's heads until summer began. Then their heads were just shaking.12. Expecting Fast Five to be realistic is like believing there really are prehistoric piranhas in Lake Havasu, AZ.13. Calling this predictable is as predictable as calling it predictable.14. Incredibly, there wasn't a writer's strike during the production.15. Sooothey steal four cop cars, and their first instinct is to race them in plain view?16. Also, now that four cop cars are now missing, much to the bottomless pit of luck to our antiheroes, the police never bothered to GPS the cars, much less write a theft report.17. Joker burned money to make a point. These guys did it because they couldn't come up with one original idea.18. These guys have more lives than Jason Voorhees and yethave only about half as many sequels.19. You could mute this movie and still know what's going on.20. Cops turn bad so frequently in this series, they should turn to politics next.21. The cartoonish finale is so 'Yeah, Right' that it makes Wile E. Coyote's schemes plausible.22. Why is it in heist movies, it's always their last gig? Their last take? Their last job? Their last everythinguntil the next installment?23. What is Monica Geller doing in Rio robbing crooked police?24. UFC called and asked Vinnie and Rockie how they can make their fights now not look so school-yard-brawl'ish.25. When you find out you're gonna be a dad, asking the nearest tough guy his fondest memories of his own dad is like Ted Striker asking the guy next to him to pinch him to see if he was dreaming.26. Wow...Vinnie's actually smarter than he looks. He took an additional role as Producer.27. With everything wronghow on Earth was this just simply entertaining and probably the best of the series? (Yes, indubitably, I actually enjoyed this mindless flick.)",4,7,23,21 August 2011
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," The Top Thirty Things I Learned from Eclipse
","1. Native Americans fear 'Cold Ones' as if they're attending Alcoholics Anonymous. Oh, wait2. 'Jake! Stay!' is probably considered an insult to someone that changes into a dog.3. Mormon writer, Stephenie Meyer, should be proud of acknowledging there are other races out there, though portraying Native Americans as savage beasts and Blacks as murderers should put her right back in the good light with the Latter-day Saints.4. Brokeback Mountain tent love can happen between any two males, even the hairy and undead ones.5. Terrible acting, hilariously bad dialogue, faux-pas Goths and unnecessary flashbacks can equate $300 million in revenues. Thanks, America.6. Quickly moving someone with a broken back is first on the list of any medical student drop-out.7. Pending Don Knotts was still with us, he surely would've been frontrunner for Bella's dad, Charlie.8. There are more shirtless boys in the forests of Washington than all ballparks of the U.S.9. Shift-changing Native Americans wear little clothing and have little regard to what happens when they change back. Do they store those shorts in the same place prisoners sneak contraband?10. There are more forest battles in Washington than all of Planet Endor.11. Bleak Bella is the most wanted girl in the world. Reasons of why are still unknown.12. Using six tons of blush doesn't make you a vampire. It makes you Cher.13. Turning into a six-ton wolf doesn't make you a werewolf. It makes you Beethoven.14. These are NOT real Vampires! These are NOT real Werewolves!15. These are NOT real Vampires! These are NOT real Werewolves!16. These are NOT real Vampires! These are NOT real Werewolves!17. Eclipse is as much a vampire and werewolf movie as The Exorcist is a feel-good and romantic comedy.18. Eclipse is as much a teen romance as Speed 2: Cruise Control is about speeding.19. Eclipse is as much of an epic adventure as Aliens is about Joe Arpaio's plight.20. Eclipse is as much as about good parenting as The Stepfather is.21. Bella is an incredible dead weight to anyone who is protecting her. Her best defense is to stay out of the way, cut herself like an emo and allow boys (and girls) fight over her. 22. 'Waiting for marriage' is just as acceptable as taking your spouse's life on her wedding night.23. Surprisingly good cinematography and a decent score does not equate a quality movie. Unless you want to watch a PBS special on the rainforests. 24. Who needs a spoof like Vampires Suck when you can laugh your ass off during the real movie? 25. The title is truly misleading; it would be far more entertaining to watch 30-seconds of an eclipse that you don't see in the movie, as it would the entire two hour film, itself. 26. High School graduates actually want to 'make mistakes' so they can be all they can be. These filmmakers followed suit. 27. Bella is the saddest, most pathetic, manipulative and selfish character created next tonext tono one. She is, in fact, the saddest, most pathetic, manipulative and selfish character created. 28. Eclipse has the least exciting climax next to The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. 29. This movie should NOT be considered for Best Costume Design. I've heard Lady Gaga actually rejected these outfits for her own act.30. The un-dead fear 'Newborns' just as much as Lindsey Lohan fears sobriety.",2,55,77,26 September 2010
John Wick: Chapter 2," Die Harder with a Vengeance
","God. The one person you want to listen to and not p|ss off is John Wick. Well, I guess broken rules and burned bridges are Common amongst the baddies.Like the first one? Personally, I loved it. This 'Chapter 2' is one of those rare direct sequels that doesn't necessarily improve on the first one, but beautifully continues the saga of a Man and His Dogs.Previously on John Wick, after briefly mourning his dead wife and getting his car stolen and dog murdered, John returns for his car for 'old time's sake' and is immediately and unwillingly thrust back into the life of the kill from a promise – a marker. 'First rule of assassination: Kill the assassins,' said Captain James T. Kirk in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. So, here, there wouldn't be a movie if John just paid back his marker.While the first movie was great, it was simple. This one is definitely more complex and yet it is seamless in the universe John resides in. It's hard to compare or state which one was better as they're both different and yet, both a perfect companion piece.On a deeper level, I do love the character of John Wick. Part Super- Villain with a heart/Part Super-Killer with a low tolerance level. He also has some Super-Powers that surely would've killed him 10 minutes into his career had he been based on a real person. The fun part of this fiction is how balanced his human-side is with his indestructability on the playground.As for his human-side, I love how awkward John's steps are, how he fumbles getting out of his cars. As much as everyone builds him up as The Boogeyman, or 'the man you send to kill The Boogeyman,' he's very clumsy at times. Don't get me wrong; the hype around his legend is warranted and I believe it in the stories about him. That said, and as much of a Bourne fan I am, John Wick seems to be much more ferocious and effective in the slaying game. And those falls he takes – just one small example: the three layers of stairs – I have no idea how the real actors pulled those off and lived. Well done. If nothing else, these actors must be honored for what they put their bodies through for entertainment and the director and crew should also be praised for their extreme ability to showcase such brutality in the fight/killing scenes. Bravo! This is one of those movies you can't skip the previous chapter and frankly, why should you? These are perfect together. Just send the kiddies to bed, get the popcorn and know you won't be disappointed.***Final thoughts: Pleasemake this a trilogy. I have an idea how it would end and I don't want to see that ending, but this definitely needs another Chapter. Only, and I never thought I'd say this, I feel bad for Keanu. These movies HAVE to hurt him bad. At least, in the bruising department.",8,6,12,30 May 2017
Jackie Brown," Jackie Crosses the Street
","I make some mistakes on some of the repeat viewings I have of movies. A few years back, I re-watched Jackie Brown and immediately named it my favorite Tarantino film. And this was after the release of Kill Bill Vol. 1-2 but before both Death Proof and Inglourious Basterds. Though, Jackie Brown remains an almost excellent film, I take back my statement. Besides, I get a lot of flack from my friends who always seem to name either Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction as their favorite.Okay, I'm getting off the subject. Jackie Brown is an excellent film in reference to acting, dialogue, suspense and character depth. My problem, and the reason it's no longer my favorite Tarantino effort, is the length and his simple desire to never edit anything out, or so it seems. Recently, I watched Inglourious Basterds in the theatres and that one, too, I had the problem with the drawn out scenes. (Side Note: I've been bashed pretty hard on that one, but I guess I do have little patience for very slow moving movies. Not all Tarantino movies are, but almost all (if not all) of M. Night Shyamalan and Michael Mann's movies are. I try to avoid those two directors at all costs.) This movie should have been cut down, and by a lot. Such as a minimum of 30 minutes to make a much more tight and suspenseful film.Regardless of that argument, it's the acting and dialogue that shines the most for me. I've never been privy to see any of Grier's work, but I absolutely loved her in this movie. Every motion she made, the nervousness, the human side to her lying/trickery was played out perfectly. But not just her, Forster (another, I haven't seen too much of to make an opinion outside of this film) had such depth, even with barely moving his face or body. You could tell he was just plain tired. Worn out.As for the rest of the performances, they were also top notch. We already know Robert De Niro will go down as one of the greatest actors of all time, but I think his turn in this movie shocked the heck out of me. Clarification: it was the most original performance I've seen of his career, something completely different and despite him not being 100% likable, it was the range De Niro had that enthralled me.Fonda and Keaton were also good, but there was yet another well done job by a personal favorite: Samuel L. Jackson. Sure, on the surface, it looks like he's playing every other role he's played, as he often does. But, here he certainly adds depth, and you can see how his demeanor changes as the stakes are raised. Also, the fantastic lines he spoke helps make this one of his best performances ever.(Spoilers follow) After a rather long opening, we learn of Ordell's (Jackson) gun-selling empire, his girl-keeping properties and his $500,000-hidden money in Cabo. Two of his minions get into trouble and Ordell gets to business to get them out of jail to eliminate them. One's easy: Beaumont (Tucker) but the other has a lot more to lose and gain, Jackie Brown (Grier.) She's a fast-thinking, smooth criminal who convinces three sets of people to help her better her situation, i.e. taking off with the half million.Group 1: the cops who are more interested in nabbing Ordell. Group 2: the bail bondsman responsible for setting both Beaumont and her free and is obviously smitten with her. And Group 3: Ordell, himself, and his gang of lowlifes. Watching her move/use her magic on the various people is part of her and the movie's charm. Will she, or even, could she get away with this without ending up like Beaumont on the slab? This is a must-see for Tarantino fans, but beyond that, anyone that loves character and plot driven stories, like myself. Throw in some awesome tunes and dialogue, and you have a near-perfect movie.Side Note: Yeah, I know I said the opening was rather long – but I'm referring to after the immediate opening credits with Jackie on her way to work. It may seem simplistic to some, but just her standing still, while moving, in conjunction with that amazing song, Across 110th Street, is absolutely one of my favorite opening credit scenes of all time.",9,1,3,20 December 2009
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Laughter Never Dies
","Up to this point, I've only seen Indy go after the Grail. Yep, took more than four decades for me to finally see Monty Python and the Holy Grail.Now, there's a good reason. Absolutely Fabulous, Hugh Grant and Simon Pegg & Gang aside, I've never been an English comedy fan. In fact, I've always hated the Monty Python gang's brand of humour. I've seen some clips, I think I might have seen part of Life of Brian and watched a bit of their show. Never liked it.Well, mercifully, I finally opened my eyes when a great friend of mine recommended it after he showed this to his kids at one of his fantastic movie marathons he hosts for them. I agreed and made the effort.I cannot tell you how many times I laughed out loud. Over and over, from the opening credits to near the end, I was bursting out and in almost tears from laughing. Of course, I was dead wrong on my original opinion of both British humour and Monty Python. Previously, I did keep telling myself 'Yeah, I get the humour, but it's just not funny.' Wrong again. The running gags, breaking the fourth wall (especially to stop a musical number) and the rips against medieval films and clichés: ALL freaking hilarious. Even when I remember certain clips from a long time ago, like the dismembered knight and the raging rabbit, I still laughed tremendously.Now, that all said, with the exception of the heart attack scene, I wasn't a fan of the cartoon segments. Perhaps that's lifted from the series, I don't recall. I'm sure die-hard fans liked that, but I wasn't pleased. And not all jokes or running gags worked or kept fresh after a whilebut that percentage was probably only 5%. Thankfully, those gripes were minor and really didn't take away from the great time I had.What can be summarized that hasn't been said about this 41-year-old comedy? It's a rip off the knights' quest for the Holy Grail. Misadventures galore as 'knights' break off to find the Grail.Don't be me. If you haven't seen this and didn't care or understand British humour, take a chance and join the journey. You really can't go wrong here.***Final thoughts: (Joke Spoilers Ahead) Gonna need to see this a few more times now. I know I'm totally late to the game, so I can't possibly match how many times others have seen it, but I do want to revisit this for some of the jokes that are still making me laugh. Like the policemen, the guards, the anti-singing dad, the mostly dead gags, witch arrest, the bird's strength, and the French threats: 'No, now go away or I shall taunt you a second time!'",9,0,1,29 July 2016
The Ugly Truth," I'm guessing they learned the ugly truth with the box office receipts
","The ugly truth is this movie is enormously unfunny and predictable. The uglier truth is that only a handful of actors, dead or alive can pull off screwball/slapstick humor and Heigl/Butler are not on that list. The ugliest truth is that I appear to be the same man-pig Butler describes in the movie (a trait I despise) as I only watched this movie for Butler.Now that's out of the way, The Ugly Truth isn't truly the worst movie I've seen, or in 2009 and it wasn't 100% unfunny. I might have laughed two times. Unfortunately, I cringed at almost all the attempts at humor or the blatant crude behavior/talk just to be like the Judd Apatow films. The difference is, Apatow is generally fresh, original, funny and actually contains a story. The Ugly Truth harbors none of these qualities. (In fact, the only similarity was Heigl, who was oodles better in Knocked Up.) We've see it all before. Uptight woman (Heigl) is looking for love, but her standards are too high. Easy-going, smart-alecky and fast talker male – with a past!, (Butler) helps said woman romance her neighbor when, you know he wants, well, it's obvious thatreally? Is this a spoiler? Roxanne anyone? Sure it mimics a hundred or more movies, plots, stories and honestly, that wouldn't be a problem if it was well executed or at least you cared about the characters. Heck, maybe you could throw in a surprise or two. Not one person did I give a second thought to, not one scene in this movie wasn't foretold; even the poster gives it away. It makes you wonder why they even tried.Butler was the only saving grace. He was funny once or twice – he did have some quick moments, and it was nice to see a male be so unashamedly open and honest about what (majority of) men want. I'm sure a lot of what he was saying is true, but he blanketed the entire male population, whereas there are gay males out there who don't really care that much about breasts. (I'm sure some do, but you get my point.) And speaking of which, I guess his character and/or this movie could be described as homophobic, if I cared enough. I mean, the character is really a low-life himself, so I don't give him enough credit to worry about his anti-gay remarks.As for Heigl's character, she was so predictable, literally boring and so clichéd I barely could watch her on the screen. And the secondary characters? Oh mythe neighbor looked like he belonged on Desperate Housewives, although since he's so dull, I'm sure one of them would kill him off within the first few episodes. The newscaster 'hot-n-heavy' older couple was so incredibly over-the-top and unfunny, they were hard to look at. What were the writers thinking? That their problems are so hard to find in their marriage that TV guy's man/butch host Butler can bring them together on the air live, have them perform sexual acts in front of the audience and BOW! we'd like them or even laugh along? I'm absolutely no prude, so when it came to them making me feel uncomfortable, it wasn't about the sexual nature; it was about how incredibly bad their attempts at humor were and how far they fell. They belonged on the Mary Tyler Moore show or any 1970s sitcom – not in modern comedies.I love hearing the phrase: 'If you see one movie this year' or 'one comedy' For this movie, you're best off if you have never, ever, in your entire life, or past life, seen a movie. Then you might enjoy it as something fresh, original, funny and surprising. However, if you've seen more than one comedy, or dramedy, then skip this one. It's just too painful to watch and I'm only guessing here: comedies aren't meant to be painful.",2,2,4,3 January 2010
The Cabin in the Woods," This Cabin Gave Me the Fever
","To avoid any kinds of spoilers, I will begin and finish this review with: I loved The Cabin in the Woods. See it. Thank you. Good-bye.(Man, I probably would double my fanbase all the way to two if all my reviews went like that)There's been such an internet uproar on spoilers for movies, this one in particular. So much so, I finally avoided all podcasts and all reviews – EVEN if they stated theirs didn't contain any. (Yeah, I know I am saying the same thing, so I understand if someone won't read this. But, allow me to assure you, I will NOT give anything away. It would be wrong on many accounts, but for the most part, this movie is plain fun as it progresses and divulging any secrets would ruin someone's amusement.)On a side note, sadly, one unhappy viewer on The Facebook® gave away one of the aspects I didn't know about. I quickly stopped reading and immediately dismissed their opinion thanks to ruining one part of this great film.This movie was, in fact, great, and as mentioned, it progressively got better – which was hard for me since I ABSOLUTELY loved the intro and film's title appearing on the screen. In fact, few impress me, but this would fall in the top three next to The Silence of the Lambs and the 'changed' one from Death Proof.Generally, I give a synopsis, and perhaps I can give a general onefive youths, all stereotypical Breakfast Club molds and usually found in these 'cabin in the woods' horror films, travel to said cabin to party, but things aren't gonna be easy and they might have listened to the old, tobacco spitting gas attendant warning them to go no further. Sound familiar?Oh, GOD, if it were that simple, it would turn most away. I, however, LOVE those types of films – and had wished the early 2012 release of Don't Go in the Woods would have been a 1/10 of that. But, I digress, that movie wasn't and this is dozens of times more fun, original, intelligent, scary and hilarious – namely I loved the character of Pothead Marty who delivered the funniest and surprisingly deepest lines. It surely nourished all I craved growing up and so much more.I can see the reviewer's POV of giving away spoilers, despite their wrong-doing. This movie is almost 97.5% impossible to describe without spoiling anything the trailer didn't provide. But, like that remaining 2.5%, it can be done and suffice to say: This is the best new movie I've seen in 2012 and should be seen by all horror (and horror-comedy) fans, especially ones like me – who grew up with horror all the way from the late 70s through to the 1990s horror.It was so good that any down time that's usually in the (honestly and I'm afraid) overused 'Cabin in the Woods' horror story lines was filled with interesting, funny and fresh approaches. You cannot pinpoint pacing as a fault here or unoriginal ideas, EVEN with the same 'ole plot that's actually presented here.Summing this all up: if you're a horror-comedy fan, a (typically 1980s) 'cabin in the woods' horror buff, you will love this fresh, exciting and bright approachdespite how dark it can be.Oops, I hope I didn't SPOIL anything there.",9,0,3,26 February 2013
Spectre," UnSPECTREcular
","The only person who falls in love faster than James Bond is that new Facebook friend who needs money to get to America.It appears we need yet another Re-Bonding. First Brosnan drilled his four Bond films into the ground and now, in Spectre, Craig has overstayed his welcome as 007 in his fourth movie, as well. What starts off very nicely as Craig's previous chapters did with an elaborate and exciting action scene, the movie has the distinction of being the only movie in Craig's films to completely fall apart after that thrilling opening and never recovers. It's so hard to pinpoint all the things that irked me here, but I'll try to summarize without giving away too much. Here are a few: > Craig looked worn out and disinterested. No wonder why he wants to quit the role.> The score was literally a carbon copy of Quantum of Solace and the title song was probably the worst one in all 24 movies.> The action was completely minimal, uninspiring and far from fresh (with the exception of the opening which eventually made me think it was a deleted scene from one of the other superior movies at the rate the movie progressed.)> The nostalgia thrown at us like the movie was in 3D was just an excuse to pad the already too-long running time and though clever at times, it got old, fast.> Already Craig's take was a Bourne copy, but one of the themes here was blatant theft.> The plot, which was already pounded to death in the previous three movies wasn't just old here – it was 30 years 'getting too old for this sh|t' old.> 20% action, 8% villain. This is something we would except from the 1960-1970s Bond movies, but times have changed and it's not time to be in reverse. > And speaking of the lack of villain, Waltz was wrongfully underused and sinfully misused when on screen. Where was the great character we loved him for in the Tarantino films?> But, worst of allit was boring.Yes, admittedly, I am not a fan of a lot of the original 18 or so Bond films, specifically the Connery ones. Obviously a lot of people/fans are, so I do actually recommend this movie to those people. They will get the slow-paced, very little espionage (in a SPY MOVIE, huh,) the VERY EASY escapes from the villainous traps, the sexuality of Bond and the so-called comedic Q-moments galore. Personally, I've become accustomed to the action-packed, smart and modern Bond and was thoroughly disturbed with getting him back to doing practically nothing he hasn't done for 50 years. Hell, all the way to the third act, I was checking the time and when the lamest climax to any action movie in the past decade arrived, I actually started to doze off.This all said, I didn't actually hate the movie. With the opening so strong and just a few of the jokes and throwbacks that worked, I don't put it on the bottom of all Bond movies. But, it certainly should put an end to both Craig's reign and to the one complete story separated into four movies.Re-Bond again, please!",3,8,21,6 November 2015
Joy," Find Your Enjoyment Here
","I don't think I've seen a movie where I didn't find, ah-hem, JOY in seeing Jennifer Lawrence on screen. Okay, fine, I haven't seen that panned House of horror flick of hers or Parts 2-3b of The Hunger Games, but the seven I have seen made me fall unabashedly and non-sexually in love with hertalent. Fine. She's gorgeous too, but, I digress.Clichéd or easy to write or not, Joy is a joy to watch. It's also hard sometimes, but just seeing the fantastic Jennifer from scene to scene, as she strays from Take-Care-of-Everything Mom to her own person, it's worth the trip. Her dysfunctional family would make just about anyone scream and makes you fight in her corner all the more.Joy's life is always on a thin thread while she manages her ex, her parents as exes and her bills and kids, but the inventor inside and that fire lit from her incredible grandmother/narrator makes her want to better everything, and everyone.Now, her journey of creating a product from scratch to sell and help everyone in the family is shown fairly neat and even though it does show some conflict – as heart wrenching as it was, it does feel a little too easy, as if there was another hour or more footage to explain everything. As impatient as I am, I am happy with not having a three- hour movie here, though as skeptical as I really am, I would've really liked to see everything.That all said, this somewhat sugarcoated WOMAN film was uplifting and worth the journey. Kinda reminded me of a simpler Erin Brockovich, which, by the way was much better, but if you liked that, you will find Joy here. On a side noteunless Bradley and Jennifer are dating, or secretly twins, I don't see the absolute need to make them into this generation's Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. While Bradley wasn't necessarily bad here, he wasn't needed either and took a little away from the movie. He was an unnecessary distraction of what I wanted to know more about: Joy. Fine, same director, same actorsnot everyone needs to be J.J. Abrams. Concentrate on the big picture, David O. Russell and not your entourage. Annnd, rant over. Enjoy the show!",7,1,6,12 January 2016
Moon," Dark Sides of the Moon
","(Mild Spoilers) Not that I had anything particularly bad to say about 'Moon' when I give it a straight-average rating, but it wasn't something that jumped out at me as wonderful or incredibly bad. I liked the sets, the lunar shots and I always love Kevin Spacey, even just for his voice. But on the dark side of this 'Moon,' it was rather slow at times, it had the same ole corporate story (Ripley didn't just battle aliens in her outer space films) and Rockwell – act as he might, he never really does anything for me. 'Moon' is set on a moon base, a few weeks shy of the end of the three year contract for Sam. We're told up to this point that he's heard voices, seen images of people not there – side effects of long-term space jobs. What could possibly go wrong with only mere weeks left? Enter another Sam, or is it an image, or is it a clone? I liked how the movie turned from somewhat boring scenes of working out and connecting with his wife/daughter on Earth to the mystery of Sam 2.0. I think it was a noble effort and on the same track of another low-budget space movie 'Sunshine.' Both were based on very old ideas, both with twists and both without the budget to be a huge box-office hit. I can recommend it for those interested in sci-fi and are extremely tired of the alien/dark corners genre that's overcome a lot of sci-fi movies of the past decades. Also for Sam Rockwell fans (again, I'm not one of them) due to this being basically a one-man Rockwell-fest. I, on the other hand, wish just once big-bad corporate doesn't play the bad guy. Yeah, I know in reality, they're rarely perfect, but still.",5,1,8,8 November 2009
True Romance," Natural Born Romantic
","Something compelled me to revisit this film 20 years after I saw it once before. I remember thinking it was just 'okay' before, but every one of my friends thought it was one of the best movies they've seen. I always meant to watch this again as I thought I might have been wrong with my initial viewing and everyone else's praise of it.My thoughtsremain the same. It's just okay. The script and Christian Slater remain the best parts of this film. It was interesting from a layman's point of view. Not as wild or inventive as Quentin Tarantino's future scripts, but definitely acceptable.Strange how we can root for the bad guy, as we did here. They're not perfect, or completely good/bad to put in the plus column, but still we wanted these newlyweds to succeed.An all-star cast, perfect for movie lovers to jizz over, they do what they needed to in their roles. Unforgettable? Not really, but fun to watch as the amateur crime drama unfolds. Recommended for 90s crime-movie-lovers.",5,7,14,2 August 2015
Her," Her, Interrupted
","I want, want, WANT this technology now!In the meantime, I'll settle for the incredible movie, Her.What started off to me sounding like an unoriginal idea – man falls for inanimate object – was quickly squashed. This brilliant adaptation of real life, but mainly where it's headed, was anything but imitative. And, we're just talking about the premise here; there is so much more to Her than meets the eyeor ear.While I am not a huge Joaquin Phoenix fan, he gives one of his deepest performances, despite that awful mustache. (I wondered how that terrible trend came back in the future, and when I asked myself that, all I could hear is Doc Brown's puzzled voice asking about men's facial hair in the future.) He plays a depressed man so well in this, you'd won't be able to distinguish Joaquin from his counterpart, Theodore.Teddy pulls a Total Recall and due to an ad he sees during his public transportation route, he acquires an A.I., or as they call it here, an O.S. (1) and develops a deep relationship with the O.S. and rightfully so. It's spoken by the sexy voice of the sexy Scarlett Johansson. Of course, all relationships are rocky from time to time, but the ideas presented here and the direction of this mismatched pair is simply wondrous.As was this film as a whole. The score, soundtrack, cinematography and mood were all excellent. I loved how it was shot, breathed and directed. The characters, namely Teddy and OS, Samantha, were so deep, I couldn't take my eyes (or ears) off them and see what they'd do (or say) next.While not a mainstream film, it is a refreshing view on the love story and where we're headedand should be headed by the film's end.I would completely recommend Her.* * * Final thoughts: Yeah, yeah, I pray frequently for the day of the holodeck, but in the interim, this would work. At very least, to tide us over, bring on the sequel more geared towards me: Him. (They can even be clever with the title: Him, Too.)",10,1,4,11 January 2014
The Nice Guys," Never Mr. Nice Guy
","Wait. This was labelled as a comedy? When was it funny?Fine. I laughed maybe twice in two hours. And I suppose I recognized their brand of humor, I just didn't find 98% of it humorous.It seems Director, Co-Writer Shane Black really nailed the 1970s, but failed to make it wildly interesting. The movie wasn't bad, per se, it just was there. Something to watch and hope for something more exciting to happenand stuff.A real 'hit'man for hire and a greedy, subpar P.I. team up to kinda find a girl, but are more interested in solving the string of murders surrounding said damsel in distress. Or so, they think she is. Oh, and the smart, sassy daughter of the P.I. tags along becausemovie.True, I am a Russell Crowe fan and not at all a Ryan Gosling follower, but the chemistry between the two was good and it did look like they put a lot of effort into this. I just kept thinking: the movie wants to be so much more than it is. It wanted to be a less serious L.A. Confidential, which, not coincidentally, also starred Russell Crowe and Kim Basinger.I guess if you'd like to see the tongue-in-cheek version of highly superior L.A. Confidential, this is for you. Otherwise, it's just there.***Final thoughts: Speaking of a less-serious L.A. Confidential, just watch Kiss Kiss Bang Bang which was like this but, again, far superior.",4,21,39,6 August 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Relentless Road
","It took me nearly a month and a half to finally see this movie, and that's mainly because I am not into post-apocalyptic movies. They literally depress me as there's very little to look forward to in any of their finales. But, I gave this a shot, and every single thing my friends had posted about this, couldn't have been any truer. This movie was unyielding, merciless and, yeah, furious with its action and almost exclusively non-CGI visuals and stunts. While I mentioned I'm not a post-apocalyptic movie guy, I'm less a CGI guy. So, this was refreshing. The story was void and what was on screen wouldn't confuse a 3-year- old, but the whole point of this movie is to see strong leads and an absolute roller coaster of a car chase downyou guessed it, a Road of Fury. Theron was excellent, as always, and Hardy, though good, was mostly just present. The real star of the movie was the superb and extremely long, albeit welcomed, detailed action scenes. So many for so long, that you probably have 10-15 minutes in the two hours to catch your breath.Wasn't a fan of the connection to part three. The never-ending battle in Max's head to give him some depth. I give them kudos for attempting to add development and understanding, but it came off like a deep background story for a Friday the 13th teen that's just gonna distract what we bought our ticket for.Strictly for action and I mean REAL ACTION – phooey on CGI, and nothing else, totally recommended. Actually, this is hard to NOT recommend since the action is so intense, so mind-blowingly awesome.wait, I'm just circling here. And if you saw this movie, like you should, you'd see what I just did there.",8,0,9,29 June 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Thou Shall Not Kill, Except...
","This movie reminded me of a childhood favorite character and his best line from his entire show:'I will not carry a gun, Frank. When I got thrown into this war, I had a clear understanding with the Pentagon: no guns,' says Benjamin Franklin 'Hawkeye' Pierce, M*A*S*H.(Frank snorts in disgust)'I'll carry your books, I'll carry a torch, I'll carry a tune, I'll carry on, carry over, carry forward, Cary Grant, cash-and-carry, carry me back to Old Virginia, I'll even 'hari-kari' if you show me how, but I will not carry a gun.'Hacksaw Ridge and I have something in common: we both hate guns. At least, Spidey does. I feel the same as Andrew Garfield's character did, but for different reasons. I all-around hate guns and if I never pick up one for the rest of my life, I will die happy. This movie, or another 'true story,' deposits other reasons for not holding.This movie is very, very long. Did it need to be? Absolutely not. While not at the caliber as Pearl Harbor, it's fluffed with so much back story that's completely not intrigue to the final message/heroic mission, I wonder why Passion Director Gibson would pad it so much.That all said, it was incredibly shot and ruthlessly real with war- scenes that went on for what seemed like hours. As much as I hate war as I do guns, I wasn't checked out by the carnage, but I was ready to get to the point.And that point? Well, for the synopsis, we get background on Garfield's Doss' home life as WWII began. Additionally, his love interest, his complicated father and his passivism. He agrees to enlist with the 'Everyone Else is Jumping Off the Bridge' hype, but only to medicate people despite his lack of schooling.Following, we have a chunk of the movie where he stands against guns for various reasons, a war scene that seemed like a good third of the movie and come-full-circle climax that makes the entire movie worthwhile. Truth be told, I didn't stand with Doss. His anti-killing attitude is admirable, but to enlist in a war that does just that is contradictory. It's like applying at a convenience store but refusing to sell cigarettes due to a moral high ground. Or wanting to be part of the NFL but refusing to work on Sunday, the Sabbath. Or a vegan chef at Arby's. Or being pro-choice and volunteering at a Republican convention. Now, yes, all jobs are possible, but dumb. Nonetheless, he volunteers and what's to become of him needed to be told in film. Only, in just a tad bit shorter film.Make no mistake: this movie is incredibly shot and if you want realistic wartime, borderline NC-17 blood and guts, this is the film for you. I'm sure some people would want that and just praise this for the gore alone. More power to you. Hackaway at more human beings.***Final thoughts: I gotta look this up. Okay, I did. Nope, I could not find the Japanese box-office totals for this. I bet they won't be very high. Like the Jews Gibson hates, you'll see how much he thinks of the 'Japs' here.",7,1,8,28 January 2017
The Runaways," The Bomb That Took Down the Jett on the Runaway
","Well, I completed my homework assignment of watching The Runaways. Can I go out and play now?The objective of the task a friend gave me was to see a different side of Kristen Stewart since I thought I hadn't see a movie with her in it yet – outside the Twilight series, that is. Turns out, yeah, I did see Jumper and Into the Wild, but I do not recall her in those. Hereyou'd be blind not to notice her even while she's fairly mellow. As always, it appears.Now, I'm not a Joan Jett fan, though I do enjoy her music when it comes on. I'm so ignorant on the topic of her past or present, I thought it was just her and some backup chicks. I didn't know anything about 'The Runaways' band, nor the sequel: 'Joan Jett and the Blackhearts.' (I guess I was right on my thoughts for that one.)Well, despite my ignorance and the fact this movie really wasn't about Joan, I enjoyed the ride of the girls wanting to develop a band from virtually nothing into sexy stardom. And they didn't waste any time jumping right into the destructive drug usage.Perhaps this movie was accurate, because not only was Joan Jett one of the major producers, she apparently was on set all the time pointing out the accuracies. If this is true, and I have no reason to suspect otherwise, it was a pretty dull ride with so little happening, the movie seemed to be stretched out as far as it could to make this a feature length. Again, that's not to say I didn't enjoy it, but it wasn't the most 'explosive' biography I've seen. (In fact, the original poster's tagline was: 'It's 1975 and they're about to explode.' Hardly.)But, it did have fairly decent acting all around with, surprisingly the best performance in a movie about an all-girl band was Michael Shannon as Kim Fowley. He was sure out there, but I thought he was above the rest. And the rest wasn't that bad: the two leads, Stewart as Joan Jett and Dakota Fanning as Cherie Currie were very goodat looking melancholy all the time. Sure, that, again, might be accurate; these real life ladies might have been a bit of a couple of downers. I did believe in their performances, but they didn't grab me to care one way or another where they ended up.The soundtrack, of course, was killer and the decades old scenery believable. I would recommend this movie of the (sorta) rise, (sorta) fall and (sorta) reinvention of an all (sorta) kickass girls band – they really didn't see that badass, by the way.And, yeah, it was nice to see some range out of Stewart, even though in the two big rolls I've seen her in were sorrowful and downhearted rolls.",5,1,3,3 March 2013
Donnie Darko," Darkness Falls
","Warning: do not read too much into Donnie Darko. And by 'read' I mean what the internet dissects from the film. Talk about spoilers for the experience!And what an experience this gem was: an all-star cast in which everyone was either great or excellent, a perfect soundtrack and above all else: it was one of the most original movies I've ever seen.Probably, about a decade ago, I first saw Donnie Darko, and that was the 'Theatrical Cut.' Unlike 'edited for television,' I don't mind theatrical versions because a lot of the time, the 'Director's Cut' thoroughly ruins the experience. Best example, the near-excellent Payback's 'Straight Up' – or Director's Cut – edition is positively awful. And same with the Richard Donner's Superman II version. Blah.That all said, after buying Donnie Darko on BluRay, I decided my second journey down this, ah-hem, rabbit hole would be with the Director's Cut. Not disappointed was I, but it did 'clear up' a lot of 'left open for interpretation' scenes the first go-around. Some people would rather figure it all out on their own, while some need some explaining on the menu. I could go either way, unless it's too widely out of left field and takes fifteen discussions to understand. Donnie Darko wasn't 100% straight forward, but I 'got it' both times I've seen it.Sleepwalking Donnie inadvertently dodges a huge bullet, in the form of a jet's engine that falls from the sky and obliterates teen Donnie's bedroom while Donnie was wandering his small town at night. The kid's already having problems – he's on meds, sees a shrink, in fights with his parents, he's an outcast at school and has an imaginary 6 foot demonic man-rabbit friend. But, he knows something no one else does.It's easy to pass this off to his illness, but we know something else is going on here. Amongst all the going on's, that is. This movie is chock-full of intertwining and interesting story lines with some fantastic characters. But, getting back to this synopsis, this is a journey of Donnie Darko attempting to understand all the 'signs' following his near-death experience.Did I mention he knows when the end of days is? And it's coming up fairly soon.The movie's extremely well shot, enormously interesting in how different it is and leads people to so many conclusions even though it's quite concluded at the end. The score and music are top notch, despite not being from this 1988-era set movie and there should be a drinking game to count how many actors flooded the screen without looking at the credit list online prior.Overall, this experimental film was a blast, and I loved how even a 'weird' movie doesn't have to cross the line into 'spaced out.'(Yeah, I've seen those 'spaced out' types of movies and wouldn't recommend going into one that has a great premise and just falls apart because the director/writer cannot control their drug habits.)",9,0,2,21 January 2013
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," For Ages 0-3
","As preposterous, unfunny, immature and horrifyingly bad, believe it or not, Transformers: Dark of the Moon was the best of the three movies. But, that's like saying it's better to be deaf than blind.Aside from the blatant swearing, this movie should've come with the warning: Not for those over three years of age. I mean, the cuss words were so obviously put in to give this juvenile film 'an edge' as was Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's flaunting of her body for the young teen boys.I'm no prude – in reference to the profanity, but just to add it to make the laughable cardboard characters 'tough' is just plain stupid. And weak.I'm aware this is a part III of an already established dumbed-down action/Sci-Fi series based on toys, but there's a point of leaving your brain-at-the-door that goes too far. The point for me, aside from the ridiculous mismatching of this 'story' and stock footage of President Kennedy, was about 20 minutes (of 157) when idiot Shia, er, I mean, Sam played with his obnoxious little Transformer pets.The positives for this feature was the fact they toned down the lengthy and complex story finally and made it a lot easier to tell which robot was which – they added color to the Autobots. Neither of these attributes elevated this above 1 star out of 5. It was just a speck of a gift for all we had to endure to get to the end of the film.Quick story brief: previously outed-alien metal race Autobots is helping humans thinking the bad aliens, the Decepticons, are out of commission. Well, obviously, they're not and both parties are trying to regain planet-destroying materials from their defunct planet. Oh, and Decepticons want to use humans as slaves, à la Borg/Matrix.Really, the point of the movie is for us to sit through painful dialogue, pitiful acting, awful jokes and minimal action sequences to get to the inevitable crushing of Chicago in the last 40 or so minutes. Matrix Revolutions, anyone? In both Matrix 3 and Transformers 3's over-long final battle scenes, I was literally left bored despite all the efforts they put in for 'heart' and special effects. Numerous times, I just looked away from my screen and played a game on my phone.Even when Leonard Nimoy ('Sentinel Prime') barked his signature Spock line, I had already checked out and could care less when he said it. I seriously can't recommend this to anyone. Again, I would for the under three crowd of toddlers if not for all the deliberate vulgarity.I guess I could end on a positive note. I did laugh hard a couple of times. Both scenes involved Sam being thrown in the air sloooo-mo while his yellow friend Bee went to catch him. That was (unintentionally) hilarious!",1,6,12,13 October 2011
Born on the Fourth of July," AlmostBorn on the Fourth of July
","Exactly 25 years ago today, I went to my normal, daily summer routine of watching everything and anything in the theatres. Mostly dollar cinemas – yeah, when they actually were a dollar, since I never had any real funds. Luckily, this movie was still playing and I thought so appropriate that I would see this on the Fourth of July. But, unluckily, the film broke half-way through the feature and we were all given free passes to return. I never did. Well, at least to this movie.Not that I didn't like it. I was actually getting into it. But, I had other movies to watch. Then, it obviously came to home video, but I never got around to it. Coincidentally, I chose the quarter of a century anniversary for me to finally return to it and finish it once and for all.I'm glad I did. It was an extremely well-made movie and far ahead of its time with its dealing with PTSD and a country divided. Yeah, this dealt with the Vietnam War, but, it fits events today as well. Cruise, who oddly enough was ALMOST born on the Fourth of July (7/3/62,) was excellent and it was heartbreaking what happened to the real-life character he played. Sadly, America's head got way too big from the WWs, and even though Korea was a bust, there was still enough patriotism to fool more men to go fight a no-win war. Thankfully, there were protesters, or people who stood up and questioned what was force-fed us.I'm getting a little political here, or, more accurately, anti- political, but that's this movie. I just happen to agree with it. Miserably, a lot of the same politics play today with more brainwashing and mercifully, there are still people who will stand up against the fear mongers. I digress. Very good movie and you shouldn't wait 25 years to see this. See it now.",8,1,2,4 July 2015
The Social Network," Social Disease
","Wow. Where to begin? OK, The Social Network is a definite for the best picture nominees, and only due to the buzz and not just the 'ten-nominees, let's get viewers' best pic award recent change.Do I agree with that? Well, yes and no. Yes, because we have to fill 10 slots and 2010 was a horrid year for movies. No, because, sadly, it might win.By all means, it wasn't a bad film; it was a very good film, indeed. But, it was not Best Picture caliber. And if they allow it to win, it can only mean: they're trying an outreach to the 'younger' crowds. Quite frankly, despite the cast, premise and target audience, this is NOT geared to the college kids. In fact, anyone who lived in the era this is pertaining to is in my age group: mid 30s.Anyways, I digress The Social Network show the BIRTH and (almost) downfall of the latest (and in my opinion, better) version of MySpace. It's enormously face-pacedand generally, that's a good thing. Here, you just better keep upbecause, it rarely slows down.The main character is one Mark Zuckerberg (Eisenberg) who's a nerd, a FAST talker and an arrogant asswipe who uses all around to amuse himself. In this case, he develops the now-popular Facebook, springing from judging women and his boredom. Lucky himit's proved quite profitable.And that's the other part of the movie: the disposition of 2 lawsuits involving the frontrunners to the social site and their greed for their 'rightful' cut.Is the world ready for the background story of Facebook? Do we all need to know how the site we (well, 99.5% of the world) log in daily, if not hourly, came to be? Time will tell on those stories, but call me ignorantbut I could care less. I'm an American, just give it to me, make sure it works and I'm happy.As for the movie, it does have good acting (I can surely see Eisenberg nominate, and not upset if he wins), good dialogue and again, the pace is as fast as the internet connection to keep Facebook a fun and social activity.Is the movie great? No. It's moody enough to catch people's attention. Thanks (Director) Fincher, who rarely lets us down. I would recommend, but it's not something I would jump to see again. As I said, it's barely interesting enough to see the birth (and almost downfall) of Facebook.but not enough to rush to see how it came to be, again.Just make sure it works, you I.T. nerds (no offenseI used to date one of you) and I will be happy.",8,0,1,17 December 2010
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," X Marked This Spotand masterfully
","By the time of this writing, Blockbuster Inc. stores probably have all but vanished. Each with a sign that indicates that it's 'just this store' that's closing. Sad, but that's how the story goes. Remember the Beta Video stores?When I was a kid, and we got our very first VCR – man, that was like the invention of television for those around my age – and I was able to save up enough money to buy two previously viewed movies. And get this: I had to actually pre-order previously viewed VCR tapes and they were incredibly $19.95 apiece!No matter; I really wanted both Lethal Weapon 2 and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. And bad.They were like gold for me. And they, along with a birthday gift of the original Batman, certainly earned their weight. I must've watched those three – my only movies – fifty times each.So, you can see: I am very familiar with Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Every inch, score number and frame. I love this movie.Later, I would contest and readily agree, Raiders of the Lost Ark is both a masterpiece and better film, but that doesn't deter on howmuchFUN this third installment is. And I'm not even mentioning the dreadful part two: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. In my mind, there's only Indy 1 and 3. You can even forget the (yawn) Young Indiana Jones (so-called) Adventures.Everything worked in this movie: suburb acting, hilarious and fun dialogue – mostly from the chemistry (or banter) of the two Jones's, extreme adventure, exciting action, fantastic characters, nostalgia – for fans of Raiders and great twists. And one of the best aspects is also a spoiler, – sorry, but if you haven't seen this 22-year-old epic, that's your fault – it has one of the best endings in the history of cinema: they actually ride off into the sunset. Brilliant and beautiful ending to the series!** - that is until they ruined it with the overkill: Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Best advice? Think of this as the actual LAST adventure and forget that wretched sequel.Heck, I can't really pinpoint many, if any, faults or flaws in Last Crusade. Pooossssibly, the over-long opening segment with the original 'Young Indiana' played by the late and great River Phoenix? Even that was entertaining, fun and had an awesome score track. So, technically, it's not a setback, but perhaps needed a little more editing.Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is overwhelmed at school, but is more so when his father, Henry Jones, Sr. (Sean Connery – in, Literally one of his best on-screen performances) is listed as missing. Indy is tempted with the prospect of finding the mystical Holy Grail, even though he, himself, doesn't believe it. He does set off on a mission to find his father, but we all know, he'd equally like to find this 'Lost Cup of Jesus Christ.'He meets up with (what I grew up referring to as 'the blonde') the beautiful and seductive dame Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody) and they quest to find daddy Jones and ward off Nazis. Not so much a spoiler, but he does rescue Henry Jones, Sr. and the race for the Grail is on between the Jones's and the Nazis.I left out a lot, but that's the basic, BASIC, premise. Seriously, if you have not seen this, or have even, see it (again, if you have) and learn to enjoy the film that frankly defines adventure. And a movie that captures the heart of the original, the atmosphere of the serials of before most of our times and how movies were really made: pre-CGI.On a related note: while some people are anti-3D, I am boarder-line anti-CGI. Sure it's a cheaper way of filmmaking, but I feel it's just that: cheap. Rarely will it be believable in my sight, for the most part it's all-but a cartoon and extremely laughable. That said, it can worksometimes. The recent 2010 Alice in Wonderland film is a perfect example of how it can really work and impress me. But, 80% of the time, it's just plain corny, distracting and again, CHEAP. My favorite action/adventures films are how they used to be made: with both inventiveness and heart. Like this one. Heck, I'll take a blue/green screen any day over a computer telling me what's 'real' looking.But, I digress. I hesitate in calling this a masterpiece (in filmmaking, at least) but in my mind it is. And seeing that this is an opinion piece, I will go on record: it doesn't get much better than this.I remember some of the promotional shots on the late night shows from Harrison Ford, et al, that casually admitted Temple of Doom was a disaster – I AGREE – and this was a make-up movie. It sure the heck was! This was thee number one redemption movie of all time.Note to Hollywood: continue the redemption. Make movies like this, verses the CGI-laced, no-script films of the last decade or so. Remember what it's like to have this much fun in the movie going experience. I remember. I recall 1989 when this was released as my all-time favorite year in films released. Too bad, they haven't come close to '89 in 22 years.And Hollywood won't listen. I ask that you do. Support and watch movies like Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Remember what it was like to have fun in the theatre, what it was like when real special-effect crews did real work on the fields and not in the office and remember what it was like to be a kid again. See this movie!",10,10,15,11 April 2011
Back to the Future," Go 'Back' to the Magic
","What teenage boy didn't want to be Marty McFly (Fox) if they grew up in the 80s? I certainly did. He had it all: someone he loved and loved him back, a best friend that could literally send him on adventures, played guitar in a band, a carefree spirit – using vehicles to accelerate his skateboarding, including a cop's and to be able to time-travel – catching his parents in future lies. I grew up on 'Back to the Future'; I must've watched it 50 times as a kid, never knowing I was taking for granted how much this comedic adventure masterpiece was completely unique and rarely a movie such as this comes around. Watching this now, having watched 1000s of movies since its release 24 years ago, I appreciate it all the more. The movie has great, pitch-perfect lines/comedy, extreme adventure, a heart, still well-made special effects and it certainly reminded me of how great movies used to be made: pre-CGI. Nothing against CGI, a lot of movies today benefit from the effect, but you have to appreciate the 50s town they recreated to scale, making me believe I was there. Marty accidentally gets sent back to 1955 by his best friend (played perfectly by Christopher Lloyd) Doc Brown and after a few scenes to convince him he's really back in time, he seeks the aid of Brown to get, well, 'back to the future.' At the same time, its damage-control with the paradox he creates that almost erases his own existence. Sure, it had minor flaws: Fox definitively didn't look like a teenager in the sequels –he barely pulls it off here and of course there's the typical 80s numerous product placements, down to the DeLorean itself – ironically, not enough to save the doomed car. Still, an absolute must-see.",10,1,1,3 July 2009
The Bourne Supremacy," The Whole Series is Supreme
","The Bourne Supremacy really wasn't the best of the three and screams 'bridge movie.' That being said, it was still an over-the-top exciting, thrilling, action-packed (boy, do I sound like someone who wants his quotes on the movie poster) film with above-par acting, suspense, intrigue and mind-blowing cinematography. Even though I call it, and it really is, a bridge movie between The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Ultimatum it's still highly recommended. While 'Identity' really is a standalone film, Supremacy sets the scene/mood: (no spoiler, as not only does it take place in the first 15 minutes, it's the basis for the last two sequels) Bourne is living in India with his love from the first film, Marie, who gets killed and Bourne is thrown out of semi-retirement to continue his amnesia-breaking quest, seek revenge and undercover the conspiracy of his beginning. Along the way, he's all over the globe, as is the CIA who believes he's part of an assassination and must be shut down, permanently. The best part is they introduce a new important character (of many) to the series: Pam Landy, played perfectly by the great Joan Allen, one of my all-time favorite actresses. She steals every scene she's in and enormously enhances the film and plot. Not to overshadow Damon, who continues to do wonders for his action-packed career builder role of Bourne. Sure, you'll have to suspend your disbelief, but what the (new) director brings to the table is a ton of action, feeling, heart and a true spy thriller not seen in years. True, Identity holds the honor of the best of the trilogy, and Ultimatum is oodles better, you still have to see Supremacy to get a better understanding of Bourne's mission.",10,0,1,1 December 2012
The Proposal," I propose 1 more re-write, but it'll do
","I am not sure if I want to start with the positives or negatives for The Proposal. Okay, I will start with the negatives to get them out of the way, but please stay with me for the silver lining.I'm sure myself and (even without reading the obvious countless other reviews from) the many other critics, will agree with the following words to describe The Proposal: unoriginal, obvious/predictable, practically minimal chemistry and virtually plot less. This story is a hundred years old, and each time I see it, I just sit back and wait and wait and wait for the obligatory 'Oh, we really do like each other!' scene. I mean, do they even try anymore?Whew, now that typical (especially for me) negative review's out of the way, I can say this wasn't really that bad. Well, yeah, it was low brow, but not as much as it could've been. I want to say, first off, that I see that it made an astonishing $314+ million worldwide and $164 million stateside in its theatrical run. Normally, that would anger me due to the quality of entertainment. Strangely, it made me happy here.America (and a lot of the world) has spoken. They were entertained. I am glad they make movies like this. Not all films can be perfect 5 star and thoughtful films; not all can be trashy 1 star films. There has to be a group of no-brain movies like The Proposal to please the average movie-goer. And since it wasn't the worst movie, barely did it make me cringe, I'm glad they make these, fine, I'll say 'light-hearted' romances.Bitchy-career woman Margaret (Bullock) is about to be deported to, ah-hem, Canada, unless she gets hitched. She immediately pulls 3-year 'Smithers' assistant Andrew (Reynolds) in as her finance. No one, except his family, believes them – and this is one of the best aspects I liked of the movie: they didn't dance around the 'secret' from her staff, bosses or the INS guy.The 'new' couple go to Alaska to visit Andrew's family, namely for Grandma's (White) 90th birthday bash. Here City Slicker Margaret has to obviously and predictably adjust to small town/island/strong family values, including an average guy stripper, the longer-sunlit days and a dog even just for a weekend until she gets back to NYC to have the green-card interviews. Hopefully, they'll pass so Andrew doesn't go to jail or her to Canada!Lovely Alaskan scenery, Betty White being fun (aside from the fire-dance,) some nice revelations from Bullock in the closing and 1 (ONE) scene that made me laugh – Bullock & Reynolds coming up with their proposal story, made this movie worth one viewing. If you're in the mood for light-entertainment and a movie to completely dull your senses, you might like it.",5,1,1,7 January 2010
13 Hours," Transforming Half a Day
","Whether or not I was told prior this was a Michael Bay movie, it would've been pounded into my head 52,000 times that Bay directed this. It's almost he couldn't hesitate to put his mark every few seconds, I guess, to prove he can direct something outside of giant fighting robots.Yes, I am aware he directed and I saw Pain & Gain, which wasn't all that good, and Bad Boys, etc. But, like James Cameron, he's been pretty much obsessed with one series for almost the past decade.I'm bringing up Bay a ton because to me, he was a distraction. His 'slight humor' at the most inopportune times, use of slow-mo, low angles, American Flags everywhere and that American soldiers can never do any wrong/always the hero, were all so spotlighted, I kept losing focus on what could've been a great movie.The movie itself is straight-forward, and this is coming from someone who knew NOTHING about the Benghazi incident prior to seeing this other than soon-to-be President Hillary Clinton's name is brought up a ton. Contractors/military men are not supposed to be in the worst region of the world, but they're hired by our government to protect an Ambassador and other spies. When memos, orders and fear sets in as the rebels attack, it's up to the contractors/military men to defend their 'base' and men until help arrives.When you take out the Bay'isms and the humor that worked sometimes, but mostly inappropriately timed, you can really get into what these men had to go through. I almost don't want to downgrade the movie because it was really intense for many of the scenes and I, of course, was really rooting for them to survive until the cavalry arrived. But, sadly, since Bay has such an ego, I can't recommend this movie.***Final thoughts: I'm guessing there is a lot of politics involved in this incident. Politicians lied to cover-up stuff. Uh-oh. Politicians lying? What the Hell? When did that start happening? Look, listen. I don't think the general public needs to know all about military operations or the enemies will know more. Duh. Lie. Lie some more. Keep these incidents between the parties that need to know. (Drops Mic)",4,3,13,12 June 2016
Warm Bodies," They're Getting Warmer
","'Arg!' says the undead.Actually, the undead aren't supposed to say a lot. And this is coming from someone who grew up on George A. Romero's films and recently, The Walking Dead. Maybe they did in the Return of the Living Dead films – 'Brains!' but that's not the norm.Warm Bodies is a touching and different take on the current zombie craze that's happened over the past few years to decade and it's the first I've seen that puts the viewer (and zombie film lover) in the mind of the living dead. And while it's not a bad thing that this is a comedy (well, romantic comedy,) I would also like to see this from a straight point of view.I digress. In a movie that's not even rated R – we're all probably becoming pretty immune to zombie movies, we have 'R' who still has a minute left of a brain yet to think consciously after being inadvertently turned into the undead. His thoughts, while both interesting and often hilarious, lead him to true love when he meets the un-undead of his dreams and rescues her.Once the initial and inevitable back & forth getting used to the idea one of the zombies would want to help the living and not actually eat them, the movie falls more and more into the predictable territory for a film that's set up like this, or the Romeo & Juliet theme, if you will.Now, the movie has more highs than lows, and that's thanks to the cast, namely Rob Corddry and lead zombie, R (Nicholas Hoult.) And the ending is one of the most original I've seen for a zombie movie and that was thoroughly refreshing.It's a nice take, has literal laugh out loud moments and enough for both the zombie & chick-flick fans.

Sully," Waterplane Down
","'You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.' Wow. Harvey 'Two-Face' Dent said that one year prior to this movie's events and was onto something!For the most part of Sully, it was heart-warming, tear-jerking and up- lifting. Intentionally, of course, but I bit, was enthralled and actively participated in how they wanted me to act during it. Now, that said, I don't know how much of this is true – I mean NOT EVERY SINGLE CHANNEL is on the same story for weeks. Unless, of course, a plane dives into something less wet in the same city this takes place in.I ask about the authenticity because, I guess there are real-life assholes who try to question a hero's actions. Hell, let's pull that back quite a bit and just say someone in authority is questioning another's 'good actions' and I know that to be true from my ten years in call centers. But, to this degree, they piled on the vileness of the villainous committee determined to prove this pilot who saved 155 souls could've saved some bucks by landing on concrete than water. The only scenario the committee wasn't shown doing was tying Sully up on a railroad track while twirling their long mustaches as the train approached. By the third act, I might have actually bought that in this realm.Regardless of the 'need' for suspense outside the actual heroism and plane going down two dozen times (in various shots,) it was a well-made, quick (thank you!) and as said above, completely inspiring from the point of view of the humble, straight-up Sully. The movie circles (literally) around a plane taking off from LaGuardia only to be immediately met by a mid-January bird convention and, though the movie says there were no casualties, I beg to differ with how many birds survived being shredded in the plane's engines. Anyhoo, Pilot Sully and his Co-Pilot, Mustache, have to make a quick decision to land on the Hudson when all other options were absolutely out of reach. Of course, enter our committee of haters who thought, 'Eh, really? That would've been a piece of cake!'Director Clint Eastwood did a great job of taking a water landing that lasted minutes – thanks to multiple heroes and wonderful coincidences, and NOT stretching it out past two hours adding needless added dramatic moments, characters that didn't exist or even more shots of what happened that disastrous morning. I thank you, Clint. Most directors, cough, cough, Michael 'Pearl Harbor' Bay, would've milked this to the bone. Instead, we get all we need and probably feel more moved than if we spent 3+ hours on some strange and fictional love triangle between two of the flight attendants and one of their dogs left at home.***Final thoughts: Funny. Using that Batman quote in my opening was just a coincidence since Aaron Eckhart said that as Dent in The Dark Knight and played Co-Pilot Mustache here. But, even he has to see the irony.",5,0,0,18 December 2016
Jurassic Park," Spared No Expense
","'Welcome, to Jurassic Park.'It seems like such a simple line, as it is, but I believe it went two directions: #1 it told you, the audience, were in line for an exciting, roller coaster ride of fright, suspense and intrigue. It's true; it didn't let you (or me) down. And #2: it started both the brand name of Jurassic Park in addition to the return of the big blockbuster. (Ironically, as it started off as a new brand name, it was marketed the same way the movie, itself, was preaching against. Much like Natural Born Killers taught us not to concentrate on violence. Good job!)There are just too many comparisons that can be made about Jurassic Park and Jaws, aside from the obvious: both were directed by Steven Spielberg. Both are huge summer blockbusters that bring back the heart to connect with multiple audiences. Both are When Animal Attack stories. Both had the predictable outcome due to its 'family nature' despite the gore. Both begin with a seemingly insignificant scene of death and foreshadowing. Both had source materials that were, in fact, deeper, more graphic, more adult and radically different endings. And both had one central leader who thought better of doing the right thing, valuing money over saving lives.Not that I'm knocking the movie. It was, as stated, one helluva roller coaster. I have yet to visit the actual ride at Universal Studios, but from what I've seen by someone who taped the whole experience on YouTube, I doubt even the 'real' experience is half of what this movie drags you, joyfully, that is, through.John Hammond's rich and loves to make flea circuses small and large. So he 'steps on what others have done' and genetically engineers dinosaurs on an island he's (ONLY) renting. I wonder what kind of pet deposits he had to produce like whenever I rent an apartment.So, due to an 'accident' leaving one dead from one of the smarter dinos, Hammond gathers up some prominent scientists, doctors and one lawyer to endorse his zoo/theme park, a la Jurassic Park, before it opens. Immediately, and not even allowing for the tour to be over, the group, Grant, Sattler and Malcolm justifiably see problems with 'control over nature' albeit zoos apparently don't count. That, above, is just the intro. The real movie arrives at one of the most influential and exciting scenes in almost any movie: Attack of the T-Rex! The power went out during the final bit of the tour and our heroes, including two thoroughly annoying kids, are caught between a meat-eater and a hard car in soft mud.From there, you get grand-scale adventure with crisp scenery and a hunt/be hunted suspense film as the dinos escape their habitats due to a greedy enemy of both Jurassic Park and Jerry Seinfeld (Knight.) I've tone down a lot that happens, but really it's a paper-thin plot with more emphasis on the adventure over depth. Not that that's a bad thing here. What works is the suspense, the fun, the humor and lines of Goldblum, (again) the adventure along with suburb cinematography and one of the greatest scores in any movie – kudos to another wonderful theme from the great John Williams.Did I mention the graphics? I was amazed back then, but damn, it holds up STILL (for the most part) 17 years later. Many have tried to reproduce, but haven't even come close to how real the dinos look and due to that, the suspense was heavier on whether or not our heroes will survive. If someone were to watch this for the first time today, they might even overlook the fantastic overlapping of the dinos and man, but think about it in 1993: like The Matrix, this changed cinema indefinitely.That all said, I wouldn't go as far as to say this is a 'leave-your-brain-at-the-door' feature, though it's close. Besides the cardboard cutout characters, there were flaws I just couldn't get past. Whether technical, such as the obvious car being lowered in the tree and the obvious green screen behind Goldblum while they strangely out run the T-Rex, or the continuity of one moment our heroes are looking over the edge and seeing the goat and the next, it's a 10-story drop. Hardly any movie's perfect, but in addition to the technical and continuity flaws, this also has the burden of having one of the oldest plot lines in Hollywood.I've read the source material by the late Michael Crichton who wrote both the book and helped write this screenplay. Of course, there has to be changes. They got the gist in the film, and I understand the change of the finale from the original draft/source material – Terminator 2: Judgment Day did the same thing: Hollywood just loves to leave franchises open for sequels. Both T2 and JP's books had definite closures whereas the movies left it WIDE open. (In T2's defense, the 'book' was made following the movie, but involved 'Judgment Day' rightfully thwarted.)I still award this 8/10 stars for being, well, so much fun. It's nice to get back to the real summer movie, it's nice to hear such a wonderful instrumental background juxtaposed with lush and beautiful surroundings and it's especially nice to see two of my favorites: Goldblum who was at the top of his game and Jackson, though he really, REALLY toned it down for his role. And finally, as mentioned multiple times, despite all that's wrong, it was a true adventure that seems big on the outside, but Spielberg did a perfect job of toning it down to a simple, though intense, story of survival. See it!",8,1,2,1 August 2010
Beetlejuice," Beetlemania
","With all the buzz about a potential – or real now? – sequel to this nearly 30 year old classic, I had to revisit this for only the second time in more than two decades. And wowwhat an incredible movie this was.My only grip, and this can't be held against Burton as it shows he did EVERYTHING he could with what he was given and entrusted with, was the poor animation trying to trick us as 'real.' Thisis another reason (from above) that I am truly looking forward to a sequel with a large budget and perfected CGI, if necessary. (Actually, I'm against most CGI – I like real heart and efforts from what I see in film, but some is necessary to showcase a larger world, à la Lord of the Rings.)But, beyond the beyond cartoons, the movie was brilliant. Absolutely hilarious, extraordinarily original, tight, with great music and a nearly flawless and memorable score. But all that is not to discount the performancesEvery single person in this film owned their parts and not once did I not feel one actor out of place. Some stood out, of course, like Ryder's Lydia, Shadix's Otho, Sidney's Juno and obviously, Keaton's dazzling 'Beetlegeuse.' But, unlike most movies, everyone still worked together wonderfully without having one or a couple steal scenes.Overall, it's the story, comedic pieces, imagination and characters that drove this very basic haunted house movie into greatness. I'm always willing to put aside my normal distain for such basic movies (far too many haunted house movies have plagued us these last few years) when it gives me something new and fresheven from almost three decades ago.",9,2,3,13 September 2015
Alien: Covenant," The Space Island of Dr. Nomore
","When the theatrical version feels more like the ultimate-extended- special-director's cut, you know the editor took too many PTO days.The weeks leading up to Alien: Covenant's release, I revisited all seven previous Alien films, including the Verses Predator installments and even with that, I watched this movie on its own merit. I knew even beforehand, you can't simply top the incredible first two films (Alien and Aliens,) but I was hoping for at least an overall competent film and a closer prequel to the original Alien.Eh. While it was well shot, the ferociously long and unneeded scenes, the completely retreaded plot, the paper-thin and boring characters and the 'twists' that a five-year-old who's never been exposed to any of the franchise films would see coming an hour before they landed all made the movie a chore to get through.A colonization ship headed into deeper space than Deep Space Nine hears (shocker) a distress call and heads to the planet/source to investigate. Wow, they landed on paradise – an even better planet to colonize than previously sought out. What could possibly go wrong?Well, more unnecessary long shots like learning to play the flute! or scenes designed to shock you later but are just as obvious as the reveal. Oh, and the title character enters the story in about the same timeframe as Peter Jackson's King Kong does. If this was meant for a trilogy and the final film, or the next one, is the actual connection to 1979's Alien, I'm not even sure if I want to see it. I vowed not to compare this film to the others, but since this is directly linked to Prometheus, I can say that one, despite its own problems, is oodles better. Better cast, better characters, more beautifully shot, more suspense and wonder did Prometheus contain. Alien: Covenant had only a fraction or less of any of those qualities. Now. It wasn't a complete waste. It was still competently made in the visuals, though not so much the little aliens. And it did give the highly annoying pricks behind me some obnoxious laughs during the tense scenes. So, there's that.Can't really recommend it even when it could just be a throw-away Alien film to watch on Netflix in a few months. Maybe they'll have the non- ultimate-extended-special-director's cut that the studio meddled with to see. Now THAT, I would've rather seen.***Final thoughts: Since I did just watch (now) all 8 films, here's how I'd rank them:1. Aliens (Director's Cut)2. Alien (Theatrical Cut)3. Alien3 (Director's Cut)4. Prometheus5. Alien: Resurrection (Theatrical Cut)6. Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem7. Alien vs. Predator8. Alien: Covenant",4,6,13,20 May 2017
Draft Day," Drafting on Looks? Absurd!
","Yeah, I spent the good portion of the last three decades hating on football. It was an amusement I played and social media made it all the more easy.That saidI joined a fantasy football league this year because a good friend/coworker of mine was enormously enthused about it. After a day of useless and backless – albeit fun – smack-talk, I vowed to learn more about this game.Step one: Draft Day. And what a way to start. This movie had its issues and clichés. The predictability level was at an all-time high, and still, it was a ton of fun.Granted, I still don't know all I need to know to get 'into the game,' but I definitely got a good idea.Sonny Jr. (Kevin Costner) recently lost his Sr. and still must keep his job by drafting for his Cleveland Browns team. Meanwhile, his job's on the line, the fans despise him and a baby's on the way with his coworker. He's got a lot on his plate. Oh, and he's expected to pick the most obvious first round choice for his traded first decision.Audiences, even ones not as familiar with football as I am, know what the REAL choice should be and it takes the better part of two hours to come to that conclusion. While I like this Moneyball version of football film – a lot, actually – it was so foreseen, I just needed to spend my time keeping up with the trade aspects and the football technical terms. Honestly, this is a good movie for both football fans and casual fans, alike. It's well shot – and the overlapping scenes were actually pretty cool – and the acting dead on for real-life characters. I'd still recommend Moneyball tenfold over this, but hey, you could certainly do worse concerning a movie based on football that shows very little real-time plays.* * *Final thoughts: True, my friend's enthusiasm and request got me involved in a Fantasy Football league this 2014 season. Because I had little invested and I do love great looking bears, I made my initial picks based on looks. In my defense, I went to the top 300 ESPN player's list and selected from there so that I would have both good looking guys and ones in the elite.This did NOT fare well considering my projected points were in the 40s and everyone else's was in triple digits. On Monday, before the season opener, I added/dropped a bunch of players and basically rejoined the league in time for the 2014 opener with my favorite team, the Seahawks and the Packers – a team I should love. I now match them with about 122 points projected, but with a less good-looking team. Ha. Regardless, this movie did open my eyes to a lot of the behind the scenes and showed me more of the passion my peers and friends have for this game.So without being the superior Moneyball, it's still highly recommended for my friends and football fanatics.",8,0,0,6 September 2014
The Wizard of Oz," The Wizard of Ahhhs
","Mere hours before seeing the latest incarnation of the land of Oz (2013's Oz the Great and Powerful,) I got a chance to see, for the first time since I was a little tyke: the original great and powerful The Wizard of Oz. And, let me assure you: this isn't just a movie, it's an experience.Far before it's time, mostly being in color notwithstanding, the sets, costumes, dialogue and special effects were absolutely advanced far beyond its 1939 release date. With this viewing, and who knows how many there had been, I found myself laughing out loud, enjoying the musical numbers, almost crying due to the genuine heart displayed by the characters and the actual feel of being in this land of spectacular Oz.Since the story has been told dozens of times and pretty much everyone has seen it, it's almost irrelevant to give the synopsis, but here goes anyways: young Dorothy Gale is thrust into a mystical land when she fails to secure herself from a pending tornado (or 'twister') attack. There, she immediately makes both allies and an enemy – the worst and, um, wicked kind, and she sets out to find her way home while meeting great friends along the way.For the three humans left alive that haven't seen this, there's more to the story and a lot of more iconic lines and characters than I probably could post in under a thousand words. Suffice to say, the number one was the world-famous Wicked Witch of the West, the pre-Darth Vader, decades before Anakin donned the mask.Keep in mind, while this does work for adults, this really is mainly for children and I am 100% pleased about this fact. That said, the almost too-scary-for-kids Witch from the West was so well played by Margaret Hamilton, so well done up from face to outfit to evil laugh, that she will – ah-hem, has – go(ne) down in cinema's hall-of-villain fame. Scratch that; she is one of the most iconic characters, good or bad, of all time, despite her short time on screen. And I loved every minute she was shown.Okay, she's not the only one that made this movie elevated from just 'movie status.' Judy Garland and her voice were excellent, the trio of Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr and Jack Haley as The Scarecrow, The Cowardly Lion and The Tin Man, respectively, were also smartly written characters that I absolutely loved and respected.I wouldn't call this movie perfect, but dang, it's right there on the absolute edge of perfection. What they did with what resources they had back 74 years ago astonishes me today. While most sets did actually look like sets, it never bothered me. I always felt like I was a part of the action, the adventure and truly in the Land of Oz.Aside from Chicago – my favorite musical, this film and the great The Sound of Music, I've actually seen very few musicals and it's quite known in my circle of friends that I don't rush to see musicals. That said, I love the majority of songs in this film and who really couldn't? I mean, when Judy sings the best of the bunch, 'Over the Rainbow,' or you get the timeless variations of 'Off to See the Wizard,' or when the bell was rung with 'Ding Dong The Witch is Dead,' you can't help but remember your childhood and have your heart soar.There's very little to say more about this fantastic ride that hasn't been said before. So, to sum it up and suffice to say: SEE IT!** - Again, that is.",10,1,2,9 March 2013
The Martian," The Farmer's Guide to the Galaxy
","If Matt Damon is stranded on Mars and is called a 'Martian,' why was E.T. an alien and not an 'Earthling?'Where Cameron is obsessed with the deep, Scott is lost in space. In good way, that is. Though I love Alien, It was thoroughly interesting to see a more realistic approach to space travel. (Oh, and take THAT, InterstellarTHIS was much more real.)While I wasn't a fan of the length – it really could've been trimmed a ton, or the Time Square crowds that would never happen in this case, The Martian was very captivating, inventive and engaging for the most part. Damon always impresses me and the twists to keep this simple idea of a castaway did motivate me to the end.But, as the memes go, why does Damon keep needing rescuing? From Saving Private Ryan to aforementioned Interstellar to this, Damon's constantly in need of saving? Was it Team America that showed the world this Daaay- mon is worth it?Overall, it's completely recommended, though some suspension of disbelief and patience is required. Oh, and it's always good to see that hunk, Michael Peña, on screen, even if just a minor role",7,2,4,26 December 2015
The Fighter," Rocky's Million Dollar Baby Cousin
","Wow. Do I have to mention to my reader(s) or friends or peers that I am not a sports fan, let alone boxing fan?YetI LOVED the following: Million Dollar Baby, Rocky (yeah, including part VI) and even Diggstown. Does Fight Club count? Or The Wrestler, even though it's technically not about boxing?But I didn't love The Fighter. Sure it was genuine in its surroundings and characters (SEE: Winter's Bone) and those, I believe, drove the movie to better than average (for most – me, just to average.) Like the mother, Melissa Leo as Alice Ward. She was great. Or the brother, Dicky (Bale) who was also a phenomenal creation.Beyond the wonderfully thought out characters and actors, I was literally bored for most of the sports scenes. Even the workout shots. With the exception of the finale that absolutely didn't let you know one way or the other on how this will pan out.The story goes: aging no-ambition boxer Micky's (Wahlberg) trying for a comeback with the aid of his rednecked mother/manager Alice and druggie older brother, Dicky. When they continue to bring him down, he (RIGHTFULLY) turns to outsourcing and does, in fact, start an upward climb in the ring.Naturallymeaning, no spoiler here – it is based on a true story, as alwayshe can't leave his family back, no matter how bad they are. So they regroup and things go as you might expect. Well, except for the finale.Honestly, I wasn't impressed in the overall product. Sure, it's well made. Leo did a great job and some are stating so did Bale. He did, and probably will win (FINALLY!) the Oscar. But to me, throughout, it was basic and by the numbers with no heartfelt moments. Nothing like when I watched Million Dollar Baby or Rocky. I can't even see past the blah film to credit such fine performances. Even the music was mismatched with the scenes.Finally, it's not necessary a movie to skip this Oscar season. But, it's not gonna rock any boats. It's simply just a movie to see. You won't take anything from it, unless you're marking it off your list of Best Picture nominations to see before the big night. And if Bale wins, kudos to him. I just wish he won for something more deserving, such as American Psycho or The Machinist when the Oscars were used to snubbing him. In fact, if they give it to him in pity, as they do, I'll be ashamed I actually watched such sell outs.",5,2,8,31 January 2011
Evil Dead II," Evil Dead Part Redux
","Hulk was remade, or, ah-hem, rebooted with The Incredible Hulk. While neither worked, the second film was a slight improvement over the previous. They felt the need to remake the first one, because, well, it was pretty shitty. So, why did they feel they needed to remake the original The Evil Dead?Perhaps, I should recommend people watch Evil Dead II (which, by the way is NOT a sequel, but a remake, as stated) before they make it to part one. This is because I just re-watched the first one last night, part II tonight, and will watch #3: Army of Darkness tomorrow night. All in preparation of the second remake: Evil Dead (2013.)And watching it in order makes me feel lousy for giving the first one only 3½/5 stars. This disaster, alone, should throw an extra star onto the first chapter. Much like what Jurassic Park III did to either of the first two installments of that series.I have heard that Sam Raimi wanted to remake his first cult hit because in 1987, six-years later, he was allotted a budget he didn't have in the first one. Humph! This part II seemed to have half the budget of the first one, more claymation than Wallace & Gromit and worst of all, replaced ALL scares with slapstick humor. Yes. Not one scene, not one frame, was either scary or eerie or even gross. And Brucey, boy, manof course you're embracing the, by this movie's release, B-Movie status, but come on. Even you are better than this garbage.Oh, and don't get me started on the numerous inconsistencies. Doors break, and are replaced, only to break again. Night seems to last for 15 minutes, the day even less, and then just when you get used to a short calendar day, it fluctuates back and forth between day and night within seconds. This is all the while, sunlight hurts the demonssometimes. And one of the greatest tricks, is the cabin goes from one story to two and back to one within the next shot. Maybe that's so the writers can throw themselves off the balcony before the movie was done.The plot was not found, but I can tell you what I observed: the first six minutes is about 80% of the first movie, so, basically, a fast forwarded recap of innocents going to cabin – A, B: having demonic words read and finally demons coming alive to possess and taunt. Then, just when you get somewhat used to Bruce Campbell – sorta – reprising his role as Ash, or previously, Ashley, running around higher than a Cheech & Chong guest at one of their midday parties, they attempt to throw in the replacements for Ashley's friends from the first movie, only dumber. Hell breaks loose, but at least they may have outs this time to stop the demons surrounding the transforming cabin in the woods.One incredible feat I will credit Evil Dead II for is that, incredibly, it's one minute shorter than number one and feels indubitably four times as long. And we're talking only 84 total minutes!Since, as mentioned, this is now a comedy, not horror. When the single and minutely humorous thing doesn't even make sense – Ashley holds down his severed hand with a copy of 'A Farewell to Arms' when it's, uh, again, the hand Ashley had to say goodbye to – you got problems. No horror, no suspense, and certainly no comedy in a movie that's 'made' for all three.Now, I did like the very ending – meaning the final 30-40 seconds, but I had already checked out by that point. For now, since I haven't watched the 2013 remake yet or the third film in order to review, I would just stick with number one. It's a lot better (now) than when I review it last night.",1,6,15,4 April 2013
Law Abiding Citizen," Law Abiding Irony
","Man, I love incredibly smart, prepared and omnipotent characters, such as Hannibal Lecter (The Silence of the Lambs) and Catherine Tramell (Basic Instinct) to name a couple. Also, I like both Gerard Butler, despite his string of too many bad to mediocre films and Jamie Foxx (ditto.) So, why was Law Abiding Citizen justokay? Let's skip to the end and state, it's the ending that did it in. But, we'll get to that later.Basically, this cat'n'mouse movie is like an 'adult' Saw flick. At least, it starts off that way. And speaking on how it starts off, what's with all these recent movies concerning vengeful fathers out for justice when their daughters get kidnapped or killed? (SEE: Taken, Edge of Darkness and now this, Law Abiding Citizen.) Again, I'm getting ahead of myselfSo here's the basic synopsis: Engineer Clyde (Butler) is having a nice evening at his home with wife and daughter. In (and out of the blue) arrive two men who stab, rape and kill both mother & daughter. Despite the bad guy's efforts, they're arrested and after one makes a deal, the other gets the death penalty.Fast forward 10 years, and as the deal maker, State Attorney Nick (Foxx) watches, the accused dies an unusual and cruel death. Immediately, the previously freed man on his plea bargain is suspected and before he could be apprehended by the police, he's caught and (literally) cut up by said-vengeful father, Clyde.But, Clyde's a clever one though. It's established fairly quickly that Clyde's in control. He's out to out-smart Nick, the police, city and most importantly, the system. One by one, Clyde makes Nick strike deals while Clyde controls things on the outside and people die. Make that, they die outside and inside of prison, all so that Clyde can make a point. Will he outsmart everyone, namely Nick? Let me state, I liked the movie, namely because, again, I like omnipotent characters, even when they're considered unrealistic. On the flipside, I think it's more fun when you don't know too much (i.e. Michael Myers in the original Halloween or Tramell in Instinct.) And that leads me to the closing. I can't spoil the finale, but I will say I didn't care for it and I doubt anyone else, who made it that far, will, either.On the technical side: though not 100% original, the plot's really not that bad, the acting's okay and the dialogue's average. Let's make that, thanks to the closing and revelations, the entire movie becomes average. Still, I will recommend if you believe in vigilante justice/revenge.",5,3,5,24 February 2010
Up in the Air," Up, Up and So Far Away
","I think why Up in the Air shot straight to the top of my 2009 best list is not only was it a perfect movie, it connected with me. I've seen a few dozen 5-star movies in the past few years, but none has connected with me personally since Lost in Translation.As depressing as it could be at times, it showed truism with the scenes and especially the dialogue. The movie was so well crafted and written, so tight and real, I loved every minute of the movie.It helps that I am a enormous George Clooney (Ryan) fan, but the biggest surprise for me was how incredible Vera Farmiga (Alex) fed/bounced off him with excellent ease. Listening to them go back and forth, especially with Anna Kendrick (Natalie) indirectly insulting them, was as much fun as watching Clooney (again) with Brad Pitt in Ocean's Eleven (or any of them, for that matter.) Ryan is set in his job, which because of the freedom of traveling and not being micromanaged, he is in love with his life on the road. His job (not the most ideal or friendly of employments) is firing those in multiple cities throughout the USA for approximately 320+ days a year. He does this due to the corporate big-wigs are too much of a pansy to do themselves. But Ryan has the gift of turning any negative statement (quiet, shouted, violent or sworn) into a positive. Yes, it's his job to do that, to ease people into their new 'lives,' but he is effective in actually helping some. (On a side note, and this is probably why this was a personal movie for me, I have to do the same thing in my own job. Unfortunately, bad news is what I have to give to some people. Though I try to detach myself, as Ryan is perfect at, I simply cannot at times and it is heartbreaking to be the bearer of bad news.) Of course, there wouldn't be a movie without conflict, so in comes two new women in Ryan's life. On the road, as usual, Ryan meets Alex in a bar. The scene was so juicy in dialogue and filled with spontaneity, I couldn't believe (at first) that this was their initial introduction. But, that sets the scene for their 'non-involved relationship,' whether sexual or just company in the long days away from their own homes. A perfect union of noncommittal, planned out encounters.The other variance in Ryan's life, the other female is a 23-year-old, extremely wet behind the ears college grad, Natalie who's book-smart, but hardly street-wise. Her idea is to save money by transferring live fires to chat-room lay-offs. Impersonal? Absolutely, and Ryan immediately clashes with her in one of the best scenes in the movie. Nevertheless, Ryan's boss (Bateman) sends her out with Ryan with fantastic comedic scenes, including and especially the ones where Ryan, whom you know pretty well by this point, is pitch-quiet.And that's how well made this movie is. You know the characters. You not only feel for them, you understand them. All the while the movie does progress and characters grow/develop and even more layers are uncovered. If the movie didn't grab me from frame one (and it did) the longer it went on, the ingenious plot developments, including comedy and drama and definitely realism, the more I fell in love with the film.It's almost award time. Here are my wants for Up in the Air: Best Picture, Best Actor (Clooney), Best Supporting Actress (Farmiga), Best Director (Reitman) and Best Adapted Screenplay. If it wins for all, it is truly a perfect world, but the following is what I am willing to settle for.No one, and I mean no actor living, could pull off the role of Ryan as Clooney did. I am hoping for another Best Actor Oscar for his performance, but I will settle on Farmiga as Best Supporting Actress. Not only was she a surprise scene-stealer for me, but she was absolutely excellent. I strongly believe also this should win a Best Adapted Screenplay at very least. And it's funny, usually when I said that, before the Oscars are announced, I'm usually right. I also wanted the following to win Best Screenplays (Original or Adapted): Brokeback Mountain, L.A. Confidential, The Silence of the Lambs, No Country for Old Men, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Juno, Lost in Translation, Little Miss Sunshine, American Beauty, Fargo, and Pulp Fiction. All of which won. (To me, the 'Original' award is even better, but nevertheless, I still wanted them to earn a screen writing Oscar.) As you can see from the list before, my favorite aspect of any movie begins with the script. Everyone of them above received a 5/5 (or close to) and it was related to the script. Real dialogue, interesting ideas, originality, pace. These are all things I look for, probably first, in a film. And Up in the Air captures all of these. So, again, in case the Academy Award voters are off again – and 7/10 times they are in the majority of categories (namely Best Picture), I'm hoping for the win in the Best Adapted Screenplay section.See this movie. Especially now with the economy in the state it is. Sure, the source material's years old, but this is as fresh as it can be. See it, at very least, to understand what happens on the other side of the desk when you're laid off or fired. Of which, I've been both and never bothered to put myself in the other's shoes.",10,1,5,2 January 2010
V for Vendetta," Remember, remember to put this in your que
","V for Vendetta really shot itself in the foot. It was advertised as a 'comic-book' adaptation with action!, adventure!, sword-fights! And yet you will get 95% of the action the previews show in the first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes of the film. The rest isjustplain dialogue.So, if you're looking for a typical, Hollywood/Comicbook/Superhero action movie with a mask vigilante who prefers snappy comebacks and swords over bullets, look further. Rent Batman Begins. You won't be disappointed and you'll be satisfied with your childhood fantasies coming true.Butif you want an amazing and adult 'comicbook film,' and a thought-provoking, wonderfully paced movie with extremely rich dialogue, character development and suspenseful intrigue, you can't do wrong with this excellent film.It's the future! And the grand ole U.S. of A. is no more. Leave it to England to rise above with a new dictatorship hell-bent on keeping people heaven-bound with 'good' messages and bad symbols underground. This doesn't sit well with 'V' (Weaving) who wants to model his fate with events centuries old. In other words, he wants to blow up the Parliament – on the (Remember, Remember) 'the fifth of November.' Make that, he wants to do it next year. This yearhe has plans.And the plot thickens. Why is he doing this? Why is he waiting a year? Why doesn't he ever take off that mask? And why does he bother with Evey (Portman)? You knowI'm gonna stop here. I've given possible 1/5 of the plot synopsis away. Watch this wonderful movie and discover the rest of the storyline for yourself. Now, let me compliment the rest of the efforts from those involved.Let me begin by saying I am NOT a Natalie Portman fan. At all. She was wretched in the Star Wars prequels. She was unbearable in that Wal-Mart Baby movie. (I'm so uninterested in her, I won't even look up the title of that one.) And yet, I did think she fared well in The Professional, but she wasn't what made that movie. Hereshe did a good job. Not excellent, but finallywatchable. She did what she needed to do, she showed emotion when she had to. The shaved head/G.I. Jane/Alien3 look was needed for the plot and yet, she barely stood out in the movie. Who really shined was a personal favorite: Hugo Weaving.I understand, you can't see him in this movie; his role might as well have been animated, butthat voice. His voice was mesmerizing. I've been a fan of his since The Adventures of Priscilla: Queen of the Desert and the first Matrix. But, unlike a lot of animated features, his voice carries the movie; his dialogue rich and serene. No one could've filled the 'V' mask as he did.When the action's hot, it's great. When the dialogue is rich, it's splendid. When the intrigue is on, it's interesting. You have an above-human character, one I love in almost any medium: the superhuman-human. And as devoted as he is to his cause, he's still human. They show plenty of examples, but mostly in Portman's Evey.There's so much to love in this movie – namely the originality, message and dialogue. It's worth a viewing and it's definitely worth a second shot. Of course, a lot of the 'surprises' or 'twists' are gone in your second plus screening, it's thoroughly wonderful to fully pay attention to what they're trying to portray or say in their directive.I'm sure I left out all I wanted to say or convey in regards to this awesome experience, but I must say: Give this a shot. Know that it's not all action, despite the fantastically choreographed action-packed introduction. Know that this very well could (and might) happen. Let's just hope there is a human being that's smart enough, strong enough and determined enough to show us we're not just cattle.Side Note: Listen to the dialogue. Rewatch the film and really listen to it. 'People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people.' And always 'Remember, remember, the fifth of November.' Side Note 2: (Spoiler Alert) I am thoroughly glad that, despite this being a 'Comicbook' adapted movie, it was NOT left open for a sequel. Not that, in most cases, that's a bad thing (I loved The Dark Knight, for example) but it's nice, for once, to have a complete movie/story on your hands. And just merely the trailers for this feature indicate a series or franchise. Thank God, they sealed the deal with just this one wonderful movie.Side Note 3: I recently recommended this film after watching a second time to a friend of mine. Not only am I pleased he liked it, he loved it. It's now in his top 3 of all time. I look forward to his comments on my site. With his enthusiasm, I might have to watch this a third time, sooner than it took me to watch it a second time – several years.",9,2,9,21 May 2010
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," D'Oh! The Misadventures of Brother Simpson
","Today's color, kids, is Brown. Boring, tan-tinted BROWN. Hope you like that color, because in today's video presentation of the old Depression-Age, you'll see a lot of it.Unfortunately, I don't like that color. Nor the color of the blues.Coffee's an acquired taste and so is the ever strange O Brother, Where Art Thou? Both I get, I'm not blind or lack taste buds. So, I understand the need for such substance from either source. But, since this is a matter of opinion and not a fact-based article..PHOOEY!Not everyone likes Adam Sandler, but if you do, chances are you don't like Jim Carrey and the reverse is also true. Comedy is very subjective. Here, I understood the slapstick and the screwballness of it all, but it wasn't my cup of brown, brown tea. I did not laugh once, but I admired the actor's balls for following the Coens wherever they wanted to lead. Including Clooney.Though he only started the movie on a different track from his normal performances, unfortunately, about half-way through, if you can get past the dirt on his face, you'll see the Clooney you've always seen. In addition, neither John Turturro (or Goodman) or the Coens change either. It was business as usual for them. They even had to throw in some classic Coens: Animal Cruelty.Three prisoners escape a real chain gang in the Depression Era – no not the late 2000's – and they're on a mission for gold. Along the way they meet goofball characters, do goofball things and sing aokay, good song.Sure, there's search for them there Goldor an ulterior motive. That's not that much of a spoiler – anyone who knows what this is based on should see where this is headed.And with that: They say this movie's based on Homer's Odyssey. I doubt the original text/poem, for which I have, in fact read, was meant to be this ridiculed. Heck, where was that Jim Carrey to step in and start singing? To watch this, you'll have to like the Blues. You'll have to like George Clooney. Wackiness. Barely a character to root for. And the color brown.Sorry, I just can't get over that brownish, tanish tint over 98% of the movie. Nor could I get over this incredibly array of wacky characters, so out of left field, it's distracting.Again, I get what they were trying to say and covey, but it just wasn't my bag. So, since I know it has a select audience, and you might be part of that – if you agree with what I wrote about what the film's about, I can't completely down-rate the movie to 1 star. At least I am able to acknowledge it does, in fact, have a following. More power to those who like it, I'm just not part of that group.",3,2,7,26 July 2010
Furious 7," Serious Seven
","I never got vested into the series until #5, still my favorite installment because they were finally honest and embraced the fact these are live-action cartoons and with each of the many 'Yeah, right!' near misses and stunts, it makes it actually fun. #6, though not as good, but still entertaining, carried that tradition.Unfortunately, someone decided to go back to being serious. Sure, there were some 'Yeah, right!' scenes I enjoyed in Furious Seven, but they were few and far between. In fact, maybe just 2-3 in an almost 2½ hour movie. Sad.Not to say this was a bad movie. The action scenes, though cut down tremendously from previous chapters, were really good. Mostly involving Paul Walker. And speaking of PaulYes, RIP Paul. I really did like him and his presence in movies. But, his part here seemed almost irrelevant. Yup, I liked his fighting the same dude twice, and he did have the most exciting 'Yeah, right!' escape in the best chase/action scene in the film. But, his part in the team just seemed blah. I understand his arc, destination, etc, but his character was actually the lamest of all of themincluding the bad jokester.What I did like most about Furious Seven were the characters played by Michelle Rodriguez and Kurt Russell. They absolutely kept things interesting. Unfortunately, the two I wanted to like more, but was sadly let down by, were: one of my favorite action stars, Jason Statham who was not as exciting to watch as is the case in any of his other films and The Rock, whose measly 10 minutes of screen time was a joke.Unbelievably, for this series, that is, they worked on the story and, while still simple, it was enjoyable. Basically it was twofold – revenge from the brother of someone they previously killed (Die Hard with a Vengeance, anyone?) and yet another big brother device they need to obtain from the bad guys sothe US government can use it. Um, seriously? I am proud to be an American, but would absolutely think that device would be best in the bad guy's hands than in our Government's. (Thoughthey probably already have something similar, if not exactly the same, to the one in the movie, anyways.)While the movie was decent and the few action scenes were good, I'm not 100% leaning on a recommendation since it was just sodamnlong. And what we came for just took too much time to get to. Maybe for fans, but even then, they were probably expecting what I was: another silly live- action cartoon, albeit fun, ride. They just took it way too seriously, especially for a part 7 in a franchise. That all said, at least director James Wan gave the dudes in the audience the two things they wanted most. And when those two things showed up, for my own amusement, I had to shout out at the screen: 'GIRLS! GIRLS!' and 'RACE SCENE!' (Taken from a hilarious YouTube video that summarized the previous six installments. And don't worry – the movie was so flipping loud, especially during those scenes, no one could hear me.)* * *Final thoughts: Yes, this is a movie. Yes, fiction. But, dang it, one of the most pointless and clichéd scenes that simply drove me nuts was one where a gun could've ended a dispute, but was discarded in lieu of a street fight. Again, I recognize this as a fictional movie, and definitively a Fast & Furious sequel, and Indiana Jones already did what I wantedbut still, it was frustrating. At least make the person run out of bullets and then do the butch, male fighting. Sheesh!",4,46,108,5 April 2015
