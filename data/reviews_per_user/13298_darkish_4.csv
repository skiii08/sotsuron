Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Genius!!
","I was very much obsessed about this movie for month and every thing other that what Volume 2 appeared to be would have easy resulted a disappointment, I don't think that there are too many people in the world that can appreciate the Kill Bill saga as much as I did, they might like it but not as much as I do. I mean it's like Quentin has watched an enjoyed the same movies I did and the same movies that I loved growing up and created this spaghetti western/kung fu epic masterpiece of an odyssey that I've always fantasized of watching. Delicious style mixed with great movie genre loving and savvy film knowledge, a great sound track, amazing acting performances and beautiful photography makes that movie a joy to watch.I'll be waiting for the DVD that will combine the two volumes and it will be hard to find another movie to get obsessed about!",10,1,3,22 April 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," I Could Watch it Every Day!!
","Quentin Tarantino's stylish revenge fantasy has come into conclusion and what a great one it was; Vol.1 and Vol.2 combined make an epic masterpiece which is a feast to the eyes and ears and a joy to the soul, a true movie obsessed spaghetti western marshal arts flick orchestrated by a genre savvy movie lover.And in the end it turned into an emotional touching story yet keeping it's revenge theme loud and clear, the characters are all loveable (Elle and Budd are my favorites) the soundtrack, Quentin's dialogues and Bill's monologues are quite awesome! I strongly recommend it.",10,1,3,20 April 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Great Flick!
","Kill Bill Vol.1 is a movie obsessed, skillfully made over-the-top stylish masterpieceI liked watching things happen in the world of Kill Bill. Quentin Tarantino made his imagination come to life in this movie and you could almost sense the fun he had doing that. The movie had his share of cool, smooth talking criminal with great dialogs, I mean Bill's 'Do you find me sadistic?' speech actually the whole opening scene was a piece of art, Uma Thurman did a great job playing the roll or the vengeful marshall art expert bride, the fight sequences were breathtakingly awesome full of extreme and lets call it 'creative' violence which shocks yet entertains you because it's a necessity to the movie's atmosphere, and of course needless to say that the soundtrack was one of the best I've heard.keep in mind that Vol.1 is only half of the Kill Bill saga and it's that good!!I don't get the people who didn't like it but I guess everyone is entitled to his/her own opinion",10,0,1,26 January 2004
Pulp Fiction," an icon movie!!
","This is one of few movies that give u the urge to watch it again even while you're watching it the first time! smooth and stylish yet full of substancevery unusual sorties about some very interesting characters adding up into one phenomenal movie, witty smart dialogue, outstanding directing and a very good use of music (as we used to in QT's movies) makes that movie the best of the decade and one of the all time greatest movies!!",10,0,1,26 January 2004
