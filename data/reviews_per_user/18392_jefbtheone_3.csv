The Hangover," critique for the critical critics
","From reading the reviews on IMDb and looking at the ratings of many movies, I now understand why it always seems a bit skewed. It is because generally the critics look for certain things in a movie, such as originality, creativity, great plot....but also decency. Tasteless comedies, pointless action movies and gory thrasher flicks get destroyed by critics. People need to appreciate a movie for what it is and have an open mind. Face the fact that you cannot be a critic for all types of movies unless you generally like those types of movies. I'm not going to post a rating for GI Joe because I'm not into military movies (other than maybe Full Metal Jacket which is in a category of its own). If you don't like dirty, unrealistic, ridiculous rated R comedies then why are you posting a rating? I would guarantee the same close-minded people that gave The Hangover a rating under a 6 probably also hated Knocked Up, Grandma's Boy, Porky's, and Clerks 2. The Hangover was funny, fun-filled and wild from beginning to end. Zack Galifanakias is a stand up comedian and is well-respected. If you don't think he's funny (for some odd reason) then give your sense a humor a sanity check. Ed Helms is on The Office. He is also a real comedian and actually The Office is a funny show (at least most human beings I know think so). If you don't think he's funny neither so be it. Okay - so the movie had a similar theme as Dude Where's My Car. The concept behind The Hangover is actually a bit more interesting considering it involves a bachelor party (if you think bachelor parties are lame and offensive then I seriously doubt you would like any dirty rated R comedies), a Vegas stripper, a cardcounter, a baby caught up in the mix, a mattress on a roof, and Mike Tyson, Ken Jeong and Mike Epps having a whole lot of fun cracking jokes and whatnot. A combination of an idiot savant, alpha male and a feeble nerd is actually a lot better than Ashton Kutcher and Sean William Scott acting like boneheads. The comedic brilliance behind this movie runs a lot deeper than some of these straight-to-the-point, predictable, basic comedies like The Proposal, What Happens in Vegas, and I Love You Man (which I respect all 3 of these movies). If you open your mind and truly enjoy a nice, dirty comedy, you might actually think it's funnier than classics like Airplane, Blazing Saddles, 40 yr Old Virgin, and Clerks. It is up there with the best of the best. I saw it twice and laughed throughout the whole movie.",10,2,5,19 December 2009
Hostel," Hostel
","First of all, to all the negative critics of Hostel 1, stop the hating. As far as critics go, usually they only give an A rating for complex, thought-provoking, intelligent stories. zzzzzz.... Eli Roth, to me, is over the top but that is his style. I enjoy entertaining horror movies and that is exactly what Hostel is. From watching a preview, you know the kids are going to end up getting tortured. We all know all the happiness was going to end at some point. Regarding the movie being pure entertainment, I liked the script. Josh was awkwardly funny and the Icelandish guy was hilarious. The girls weren't just hot because of their looks and the much-needed nudity (horror movies always used to have nudity!!!!). The accents were great and brought creepiness to the movie. 'Sirious Ameriken' . My only issue with Hostel and all the other horror movie that comes out nowadays is that it's just not scary at all. I think Eli Roth wanted it gory more than scary but still. I feel like the last scary movie I saw was Candyman. Eli Roth has been great but the fact that he's over the top at times turns people off. I mean Texas Chainsaw Massacre was kind of funny, especially part 2, and I like funny, but let's lean towards scary sometimes, especially for a horror movie. That's just an example of a classic horror movie that can be a bit comical. Hostel was by far Eli's best because he kept it pretty morbid. It is one of the most entertaining horror movies I have seen in a while. Hostel 2 was also pure entertainment, but he went Eli Roth on it and took it one step too far on the jokes (Goalllllllll). So overall, good script, good acting, good production, good nudity and good torture. 9 out of 10.",9,0,0,27 September 2008
Kick-Ass," Strong performance
","Over the last couple of years I've started to notice the rise of a great actor, Mark Strong. Sherlock Holmes, Body of Lies and RocknRolla - all 3 are worth checking out. And now we have the real stardom with his, pun-intended, strong performance in kick-ass. I just read one review noting the brilliance of the movie because of how it combines 'hilarious comedy with incredibly graphic, stylized violence' (quote from pgtmatrix's review). Well it could not have been done without Mark Strong.On a side note, only Nicholas Cage can be the Jean Reno to Natalie Portman in a comic book style comedy. It was just enough character from him to prevent the movie from being over the top or just straight up goofy. He connected well with the style of humor in the movie although I can understand why someone would dislike Nicholas Cage in general.Usually critics rip apart ultra violent movies or rated R comedies. Nowadays trash talking and bloodshed is just not accepted by critics. It takes this type of movie to shut everyone up. Some critics need to face the fact that they just don't like movies with added profanity and unrealistic killing sprees. If you don't like it better off sticking to PG movies or those deep Tom Hanks movies.",10,4,14,24 April 2010
