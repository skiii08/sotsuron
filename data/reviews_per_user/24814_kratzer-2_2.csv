Requiem for a Dream," The best movie I've ever seen
","This movie blew me away. I wish I had been able to see it on the big screen, but our local theater just gets big Hollywood pieces of crap. Burstyn gives the best performance ever by a woman, Leto continues to impress me, Connelly is excellent, and who knew a Wayans brother could be so good in a serious role. If you have the unedited DVD version of the film, I suggest listening to Aronofsky's commentary. It's very interesting, and he points out many things that I had missed. This movie is just great. Aronofsky is a genius.",Null,0,1,3 January 2002
Heat," Masterpiece that was just the right length
","Heat is one of the best films I've ever seen. Michael Mann is the greatest storyteller working in Hollywood today. I was amazed to see that a number of reviewers of this film commented that it would have been better if it was shorter. I think it would have been much worse. The movie was a perfect length. Even if one scene was deleted, the movie would not have been as good as it was. Another criticism of the film is the 'weak' ending. I thought the ending was perfect, and it should not have ended any differently. The lighting by Dante Spinotti stands out especially in this scene, even though it was excellent throughout the movie. Heat is the best crime drama in recent years. 10/10",10,0,0,18 August 2001
