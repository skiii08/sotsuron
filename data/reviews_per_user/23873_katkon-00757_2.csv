The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Without reason for existence
","As it was expected,the movie was boring and without interest at all. The third movie could be the final and not another movie that constitutes a repeat of two previous movies.The scenario in this part it was pretentious and there was no progress to this,essentially. However, the actors is a positive part of this movie and especially the main actress. Another positive thing is the excellent direction,such as in the previous parts of Hunger games, and it's clear that there is a huge budget. Unfortunately, the action is less than the previous movie as a result of the gaps in the scenario. I'm not sure if i will watch the next part of Hunger Games because i consider that it lost its interest after this movie.",4,1,3,27 December 2015
Ant-Man," Ladies and gentlemen,excellent in my opinion !
","Here, we have a great movie from Marvel with a very interesting plot. All the super heroes are huge and massive with a lot of super powers, which make them boring.In this movie, we have a tiny super hero who is stronger than all the others heroes of Marvel and constitutes a revolution in the 'world' of Sci-fi. A lot of action, funny moments and a different(!) view of all the insects(no spoiler).Of course,the movie gets credits for the role of Michael Douglas who is a class by himself. It should be noted that i'm not fan of this kind of movies, but this initiated my interest and ,clearly,right. Regarding the rating, i rate 10 for her originality. I consider that she worths better rating.",10,1,4,29 December 2015
