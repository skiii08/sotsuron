Raiders of the Lost Ark," Best Movie Ever
","I wish I could give this movie higher that 10 out of 10. I kind of wish I could give it 100 out of 10. This movie was one of the first real adventure movies I've ever seen. It is the absolute best movie I've ever seen, second only to maybe Jaws. It's such a great movie, everything is awesome. Harrison Ford is a great actor, Karen Allen is pretty good too. They're all great. Belloq is a sinister villain, and Marcus Brody is a good ally. I loved this movie so much. It's a great movie. My review has to be ten lines long, and I don't want to keep saying how great it is, so my only advice is to just see it. Just see it. Please. Go. See it now. Enjoy it. Go see the best movie ever! Go see it now! Please! Go now! See Raiders of the Lost Ark!",10,1,2,9 June 2008
This Is the End," So Funny It Hurts!!
","'This Is The End' is the directorial debut of screen writing duo Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, who also brought us 'Superbad' and 'Pineapple Express,' and to be honest, this is their crowning achievement. This movie primarily focuses on a group of comedians trapped in James Franco's house during the apocalypse. Aside from having a great premise as it is, the film's main draw is the fact that all these actors are playing exaggerated versions of themselves, which becomes the basis for some truly laugh-out-loud moments. For the most part, the script is fairly loosely written, which leaves a lot of room for improvisation by the actors. Those improvised sequences are where the film shines, because it creates a sense of camaraderie among the actors which adds a lot to the enjoyment factor. You get a sense that all of these guys are really good buddies just having a good time making this movie, and that's something the film captures really nicely. But above all else, the movie is just plain funny. It is quite often very sophomoric and juvenile, but it never insults the audience's intelligence. For me, every single joke hit hard and made me laugh to a point where my face began to ache! Movies don't get much funnier than this, and the credit really goes to the cast for making this premise work so well. Towards the middle of the film, it starts to feel like it drags, but it picks right up again towards the end that I don't mind. I easily could watch this movie 10 more times, and laugh every single time. I can't recommend this movie enough, I loved 'This Is the End.'",9,7,16,19 June 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Superb, Intense Action with Witty, Clever Humor
","It seems only fitting that the film that started the billion-dollar franchise is also one of the best films that Disney Pictures has ever released, and also one of the best adventure flicks ever made. 'Pirates of the Caribbean' has a little in it for everybody, great action sequences, sharp, hilarious comedy, stellar characters, a great story, and of course, Jack Sparrow, who's impossible to not adore.The film tells the story of Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate who teams up with a blacksmith Will Turner as they attempt to rescue Elizabeth Swann, Will's love interest, who has been captured by a cursed crew of a pirate ship called the Black Pearl, captained by the evil Barbossa. However, Jack has ulterior motives in their mission, and from there the film takes off on one of the most exciting and enjoyable action romp of the decade.The characters are all brilliantly fleshed out and interesting, and sympathetic, but the character who steals the show is Captain Jack. Johnny Depp gives the performance of a lifetime with Jack, masterfully crafting a character who is incredibly sly, charismatic, funny, and yet constantly gets himself into stupid situations. Never has a character like this been committed to film, and it's immortalized through Depp. He absolutely makes this film leap from good to great.The film's special effects, while somewhat dated by today's (and the sequel films) standards, still maintain a sense of charm to them and the stunt sequences are all fabulous. The action is intense and entertaining, keeping you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The swashbuckling never gets old, and the film is always great fun.Thanks to this film, the pirate genre was redefined from silly and hokey, to what 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' gives audiences: a strong story intertwined with intense action and humor. It's one of my personal favorite films, and definitely one of the best films to bear the Disney name. It's great, and I absolutely recommend anybody who wants to enjoy themselves with a movie to see it.",8,0,2,28 March 2011
Spider-Man 3," Sadly, A Disappointment
","I love Spider-Man. He's probably one of the greatest comic heroes in history. The first two films were absolutely amazing. Great pieces of film work. However, Spider-Man 3 fell very short of those standards. I did like it, but I didn't LOVE it as I felt about the first two films. I will first bring up some of the pros, and then the cons.PROS: Topher Grace was really surprising as Venom. I liked his portrayal of the character, but he was way under-used. I think he should have been the main villain of the film.The visual effects were the best in the series, except for the cartoony crane scene. Venom looked great, Sandman was cool, and the fight sequences are excellent.CONS: Tobey Maguire wasn't very good in this film. I liked the way he portrayed red Spider-Man, but once the black suit comes on... he sucks. He just wasn't good at being bad. Oh, and the crying. Come on! And the dancing! What is up with that?The multiple story lines kept it hard to focus on one thing. In Spider-Man 2, if was perfectly focused. Peter and MJ's relationship, Peter and Harry's relationship, and Spider-Man and Dr. Octopus's relationship. That was it! In this one you get Peter and MJ's relationship, Harry's amnesia, the black suit, problems at the Bugle, Gwen Stacy, Venom, New Goblin, and Sandman. It was just too much for the audience to get in one sitting! My advice would have been to leave out Sandman, Gwen, the amnesia thing, and MJ's whole play thing. It was too much of a serious romance movie rather that a super-hero action thriller.Venom should have lived. He is my absolute favorite villain in all of Spider-Man's rogue gallery, and he's killed within fifteen minutes after his appearance. He's way too under used and should have been held as a cliffhanger for Spider-Man 4, along with Harry Osborn His part as New Goblin is way too hidden behind Sandman and the romancy garbage that has absolutely no place in a super hero action movie of the summer blockbuster sorts. Sandman looked bad in some of the scenes. At the end, he's that freakin' King Kong of Sand, and I hated that.Overall, it's an okay entry in the films of Spider-Man, but I don't think it was good enough. I do hope the original cast returns, and that Spider-Man 4 is superior to this inferior film. I did hear of an interview featuring an unnamed actor saying his character appears to die in this film but actually survives somehow. Personally, I hope it's Eddie Brock, but only time will tell. Please don't make it be Harry, don't go all 'One More Day' on us. He's dead, it's done. I'd bet money Venom's returning. I'm holding out for Spider-Man 4 to fix this slight mess of a film. However, the effects do aid the movie to my liking.",6,0,1,7 May 2008
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A Fitting End to What May Be the Greatest Trilogy of All Time
","While 'Star Wars' laid the ground work and 'The Empire Strikes Back' flipped the formula on its head, the final chapter of the epic Star Wars Trilogy brings everything full circle, at long last tying up the cliffhangers from the end of 'Empire' in a perfectly satisfying conclusion to a truly remarkable series. Following an exhilarating rescue on Tattooine, the Rebels find themselves up against a Second Death Star. While the assault ensues, Luke Skywalker must confront his fate at long last, and face off against the evil Darth Vader, as well as the long-awaited appearance of the sadistic, tyrannical Emperor.As with the previous films, 'Return of the Jedi' is a great movie. While it isn't nearly as dark as 'Empire,' it doesn't have to be. It does its job just fine, wrapping up the trilogy in the most excellent way possible. The sequences in Jabba's palace and the speeder bike chase are some of the most enjoyable in the entire series, again showing how far technology advances from film to film. This is by far the most action-packed entry in the series, a high-energy movie that never leaves you bored.What makes this movie for me, however, is the climax. The three overarching battles are incredibly engaging, and a complete thrill to watch. The battle on Endor is a very enjoyable action sequence, the dogfight with the Death Star is the best space battle of the series, and the scenes in the Emperor's throne room are simply captivating, completely commanding your attention whenever they are on screen.'Return of the Jedi,' while a bit lighter in terms of its tone, still retains that incredible level of 'Star Wars' magic that its predecessors had, wrapping everything up in a simply perfect way. I consider it to be one of my favorite movies, along with the rest. 'Return of the Jedi' confirms the Star Wars series as one of the greatest trilogies of all time. A perfect ending to a spellbinding series.",10,1,2,19 February 2012
The Matrix Revolutions," Not That Bad, People
","Okay, I know this was not the best conclusion to the trilogy. It's very underrated. I watched it the other day, and thought that the main reason that people didn't like it was that it wasn't fully explained. Did Trinity die, did Neo die, what happened to everybody in the end, who cares! Can't you people see that the Wachowski's want people to make it up for themselves. I think that it's a really good way to end the series. It's a great way to end the series. The Neo/Smith fight was probably the coolest fight in the entire series. I thought the whole Bane/train station subplot were good. I thought that the entire movie was pretty gripping, and the entire battle for Zion was great. The only thing I didn't like really like was that they didn't go into the Matrix as much. It was only the opening with the train station bit, and the final Smith battle. I liked this movie. It wasn't as horrible as everybody else says. I liked it a lot. So, if you saw the first two and like them, then see this one. Don't expect it to be as good as the first two, but you will like it. I know you will.",8,2,3,9 June 2008
Man of Steel," Lays The Groundwork for What Could Be a Perfect Superman Movie
","Ever since his first appearance in Action Comics #1, Superman has been an American icon. Being the first real comic book superhero, it was only fitting that he be brought to the big screen properly for modern audiences. With Zack Snyder's 'Man of Steel,' I don't necessarily think this is the Superman film we've been waiting for all these years, but I do think what we got is something that set us off in the right direction. This is another take on the origin story of Kal-El, a baby born in the last days of the planet Krypton who is sent to Earth by his father (Russell Crowe), where he is raised by a simple farm family, the Kents (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane). Raised as Clark Kent, he discovers that on this planet, he has magnificent powers that he eventually decides to use to protect humanity as Superman. This is a story that nearly everyone knows, but 'Man of Steel' takes some different story beats that definitely lead down a darker, more emotional and realistic path that I really enjoyed. One of the strongest elements of the film is the casting, particularly the casting of Superman and his fathers. Henry Cavill definitely showed flashes of greatness in this film, and while he hasn't given a character-defining performance here like Christopher Reeve did in Richard Donner's 'Superman,' I definitely believe that Cavill has the potential to grow into that perfect Superman for modern audiences. The true standouts, however, are Crowe and Costner as Jor-El and Jonathan Kent, respectively. Both of these men gave performances that elevated the emotional weight of this film beyond that of a typical comic book movie, Costner in particular. Amy Adams also does a fine job, probably giving us the best Lois Lane yet.However, this film is not without it's faults. I think the pacing felt awkward in the second half particularly. The film was primarily split off in two halves, a story-driven first half and an action-packed second. I enjoyed the action in this film for the most part, but after a while, it started to feel sort of dull and lifeless. It was borderline excessive for this movie, but I also think that the problem with the action in this movie is that it was so separated from the story elements. If the action would have been more interspersed among emotional, character driven sequences, they probably would have seemed more special when they happened, but instead, the action sort of felt redundant after a while.Despite its faults, 'Man of Steel' is a really enjoyable film. While it's not the Superman film I've always wanted to see, I think the groundwork has now been set. I'm very excited to see where the sequels take us from here, because now that everything is established, we can now have a Superman movie we've been waiting for. And as far as the origin story goes, 'Man of Steel' is a great way to set up this DC Universe. I can't wait to see where Big Blue goes from here!",7,4,7,19 June 2013
The Shining," Horrid Movie
","Stephen King is one of the greatest American novelists in the past century. While he is dubbed a 'horror writer,' he is much more than that. He is a character writer, and while his novels are intended to scare, characters are the central point of the novels. They rely so heavily on backstory that the characters are practically real. However, this is very hard to do on film and it can result in making the story seem unimportant. So, as you can expect, I was not eager to see how they could ruin The Shining. Well, after reading the spectacular novel, I moved onto the film. After watching the film, I was flaming mad. The film The Shining does not fail from their overuse of backstory. These characters are completely shallow and you don't care about them. King novels are hard to adapt, but they can be done well. Carrie is an example of that. However, this movie is an awful adaptation. Kubrick basically took some character names, some locations, and made his own 'scary hotel' movie. Why he couldn't just make his own 'scary hotel' movie, I don't know. The acting is, for the most part, garbage. Shelley Duvall gives one of the worst performances I've ever seen. She's just so awful that you want her to get killed, as opposed to the novel. I just felt that I didn't care about anybody in this film. It felt empty and like there was no point to anything in the end. King said that he doesn't like the film because it doesn't make you feel. I agree completely with that. I felt nothing other than lack of interest when I watched this stinker. It wasn't even passable as a good stand-alone film. I hated every minute of this film. It was supposedly psychological horror, but it didn't make me think at all. This movie is horrible, and I hope book readers never have to witness an adaptation as bad as this atrocity...well, okay, there is the '97 TV movie, but even that's not as bad as this crap!",10,35,64,27 March 2009
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Everything Has Changed
","In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry becomes trapped in a much darker wizarding world where Harry is hunted after by an fearsome serial killer named Sirius Black, who sold his parents to Voldemort. Harry has a story that isn't as worried about the evil wizards, but more about past that is delved into even deeper because of Professor Lupin, the new DADA teacher, who is a brilliantly cast by David Thewlis. Gary Oldman is great as the dark on the outside, secretly good guy Sirius Black. Again, the trio's acting progresses. I think that this is the best movie in the series. Alfonso Cuaron's directing was pretty good, and change was only expected when they didn't do it in 2003, one year after the previous film like the first two. Change is good, and I think that this series is progressing constantly.",10,0,1,7 June 2008
Alien vs. Predator," A Guilty Pleasure If There Ever Was One
","OK, let me start by saying that I LOVE Alien, Aliens, and Predator. All three are excellent movies, with great stories, characters, and thrilling action sequences and incredible suspense. And when this movie is compared to those sci-fi classics, this film absolutely pales in comparison. But, I enjoyed it nonetheless. When I first saw this film, I had never seen the original films, so I didn't know what to expect. Before I go any further, let me say this: AVP is not a good film. Not by any means is AVP even in consideration to be called a 'good' movie. But, I still enjoy it. I mean, yeah, the dialogue is cringe-worthy, the acting is mediocre at best, and the story sounds like a crappy fan fiction written by some 12 year old kid. It's stupid, but, it's entertaining. It does feel like the violence is severely held back, but in the long run, I don't think it negatively affects the movie that much. This film isn't even in the same league as the original films, but I still enjoyed it because it's a fun, action-packed experience. I enjoyed it despite it's blatantly obvious flaws, and it definitely is a guilty pleasure of mine, along with its sequel that suffers even more from the same problems. In the end, AVP is a fun, yet unbearably stupid film. 6/10",4,1,2,7 February 2010
Batman Begins," Batman is Back and Better Than Ever
","Batman Begins is a great film. It's got great acting, a believable plot, and some fantastic cinematography from Wally Pfister. Christopher Nolan is a great director, and he does the Batman franchise justice with Batman Begins. He takes the film to an uber realistic, dark place where the Batman films have never even seen before. Christian Bale is very good in this movie. Watching him go from a revenge-seeker to a hero is a perfect story arc. Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, and Morgan Freeman are also appreciated talents that shine through. However, Katie Holmes was a bad casting choice. She's an annoying, un-sympathetic character that I just didn't care about. But, other than that, I really liked Batman Begins.",9,1,2,6 June 2008
Back to the Future Part III," A Fitting End To A Great Trilogy
","In Back to the Future Part III, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) goes back in time again...waaaaay back. For the past 8 months, Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) has been peacefully living in the year 1885, since the time machine was struck by lightning. After finding out that Doc is murdered, Marty goes back to the Old West to save his friend and return to 1985. This movie is my least favorite of the trilogy, but it's still a good movie. After the hectic Part II, Part III is a bit more laid back. I like this movie a lot, and although the first two are better, it's still a fun movie that I'll watch every now and again. By the end of the film, it's sad to know that the adventure's over, but it still was one hell of an adventure.",7,1,1,15 June 2009
The Evil Dead," The Ultimate Experience in Grueling Horror? YOU BET!!
","In the year 1979, a group of friends set out to make the Ultimate Experience in Grueling Horror. With a shoestring budget of less than $375,000, Sam Raimi, Rob Tapert, and Bruce Campbell deliver one of the scariest movies I've ever seen.The Evil Dead tells the story of 5 college kids (Bruce Campbell, Ellen Sandweiss, Rich DeManicor, Betsy Baker, and Teresa Tilly) who travel up to an isolated cabin in the woods for the weekend. However, while they're there, they find a strange book entitled Naturon Demonto, (renamed Necronomicon Ex-Mortis in the sequels) which roughly translates to Book of the Dead. They accidentally play a tape recording that recites demonic incantations from the book that eventually makes the demons reawaken and possess them one by one until the lone survivor, Ash (Campbell), has to step up and fight back.This is a great film. Sure the acting isn't great, but this movie features some great practical effects from Tom Sullivan. Yes, it's fake. Yes, it looks fake. However, it's impossible not to appreciate them.It's a VERY gory movie. For pretty much the last half-hour or so, blood is soaking everything. There's even a scene where a character get's it's hand hacked half-way off, so it tears the hand the rest of the way off with it's mouth.This film introduces Ashley J. Williams, better known as Ash. The character of Ash is well-known for being a badass, but don't expect that from him in this one. In this one, Ash is actually kind of wimpy for the most of the movie. It's not really until Evil Dead II that Ash becomes a full-blown badass.So, anyway, this movie is amazing. It's scary, it's entertaining, and it's a hell of a lot of fun to watch with a large group of people. So, in the end, does Raimi succeed in bringing us the Ultimate Experience in Grueling Horror? My answer is definitely yes.",8,2,4,19 June 2008
The Dark Knight," Best Batman Movie, Best Comic Movie
","I saw this last night, and all I can say is wow. This movie is amazing. The storyline is that DA Harvey Dent is putting the criminals away without wearing a mask, and Batman is starting to wonder whether Gotham really needs him anymore. And, when the villainous Joker arrives, causing chaos for the sake of chaos, Batman must confront everything he believes in to take down The Joker. Well, I can't really point out any flaws. The storyline was perfect for it's style: a crime movie. The acting was top notch as well.Christian Bale plays Batman/Bruce Wayne and was in my opinion underused. The film featured Joker, Dent, and Gordon more than Batman/Bruce. I thought that having Bale get into the batsuit more was a good thing to do, but I missed the style of the previous movie, with very little batsuit. Overall, Bale does a good job.Michael Caine plays Alfred Pennyworth, Bruce's butler and friend. Caine once again portrays the part beautifully and is one of the parts that shines the brightest in this movie.The late Heath Ledger plays The Joker, and is by far the best part of the film. Ledger's Joker is amazing. In this Oscar-worthy performance, Ledger completely transforms into the role of The Joker for this movie. When I look at the screen, I don't see Ledger on screen. I see The Joker. I will be disappointed if Ledger doesn't get an Oscar for his role.Aaron Eckhart plays Harvey Dent/Two-Face, and seems to be the main character. Dent is Gotham's white knight who goes bad after an incident with The Joker. His relationship with Rachel is, in my opinion, preferred to Rachel and Bruce. When Dent turns into Two-Face, he really turns. Two-Face is gruesome and frightening, and may disturb some people. Eckhart portrays the white knight well, and I enjoyed his performance.Gary Oldman plays Lt. Jim Gordon. Gordon is a great character, and is one of my favorites. He gets the character spot on, and is nearly flawless. Oldman is one of my favorite actors and portrays Gordon wonderfully.Maggie Gylenyhaal plays Rachel Dawes, and takes over for Katie Holmes. I don't like Katie Holmes, so I was glad to see Maggie take over for the part. However, Maggie still has trouble with the role and I didn't really care for her either. Maybe it's just the character of Rachel, but I didn't like her role.Morgan Freeman plays Lucius Fox, the new C.E.O. of Wayne Enterprises. Like Michael Caine, he is a bit underused but when he's used, used appropriately. I liked Morgan Freeman in this role, and I hope he's back on the sequel.Overall, The Dark Knight is a must-see film for anybody looking for a good film. It this isn't a big Oscar winner, then I'll be shocked. Bring on The Dark Knight at Oscars '09!",10,3,7,18 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Great Movie, Bad Adaptation
","Being a Harry Potter fan for almost 10 years now, I've read each book at least 3 times, but this one breaks the record. I've read Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix at least 6 times. Therefore, I know this book better that any of the others. It always has been my favorite book because Sirius is much bigger than ever before, but that was just foreshadowing to is imminent death at the end of the book. When I walked out of the theater, after seeing the biggest film of the year (for me), and meeting the actors who portrayed the Weasley twins, I was ecstatic. Afterward, though, I felt somewhat flat. This was my favorite movie in the series. However, as an adaptation of the book, I thought it was awful. But, I didn't want a carbon copy of the book. That's what makes the movies exciting. To see what they do with it. I hated the fact that Ron and Hermione were pushed outward, how short Harry cut his hair (Harry wouldn't do that, the scar wouldn't show, but you see it here anyway), and the removal of Quidditch. I know what they wanted to do with this movie, and I liked David 'Montage Man' Yates as director. I'm glad to see him return. Overall, I think that this is the best entry in the film saga, but falls short as an adaptation of an 870-page-long novel.",9,0,2,7 June 2008
Toy Story," My Favorite Animated Film EVER
","I love Toy Story. Plain and simple, it's a phenomenal film. Not only is it one of the most well-made animated films ever made, it's also one of my favorite films in general. It's incredibly appealing story, the voice acting is perfect, the characters are very likable and fun to watch on screen, and the animation is stellar for it's time.The basic premise of TOY STORY is life seen through the eyes of a toy. The film centers around the toys belonging to a boy named Andy, particularly following his favorite toy, a stuffed cowboy doll named Woody. Woody is primarily the one in charge of Andy's room, but his authority is threatened when Andy gets a new spaceman toy named Buzz Lightyear. The only problem is that Buzz doesn't know he's a toy. He genuinely thinks that he is a real space ranger.Tom Hanks voices Woody and Tim Allen voices Buzz, and both do a stellar job. I couldn't ever imagine anybody voicing these two characters besides Hanks and Allen. The supporting cast does a wonderful job as well, such as Jim Varney as Slinky Dog, Wallace Shawn as Rex, Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, Annie Potts as Bo Peep, John Ratzenberger as Hamm, and others. The characters are so fun to watch, and you truly care about them as you watch Woody and Buzz form a friendship. At it's heart, Toy Story is a buddy movie, and one of the best made at that.While the animation seems somewhat dated today when compared to PIXAR's more recent films, the film does still look very nice. Looking back at the film, it truly is a technological achievement as well as a film-making achievement in general.Being the first animated film done entirely through computers, Toy Story had a lot of expectations to meet. And not only does it meet expectations, it surpasses them to infinity and beyond.",10,1,1,3 June 2010
Toy Story 2," A Perfect Sequel in Every Respect
","Toy Story is a tough act to follow. The first film is nearly perfect in every way imaginable. But Toy Story 2 not only meets the high standards set by it's predecessor, it comes close to surpassing them.Tom Hanks and Tim Allen return as Sheriff Woody and Buzz Lightyear respectively, and this time, Woody is stolen by a greedy toy collector. Woody and the gang discover that he is actually a rare toy based off of a classic 1950's TV show called 'Woody's Roundup.' He meets the rest of the toys from his roundup gang in the collector's apartment, including Jessie the Yodeling Cowgirl, Bullseye the horse, and Stinky Pete the Prospector. He soon discovers that him and his new friends are set to be sold to a museum in Japan. All the while, Buzz gathers up a group of toys to go rescue Woody from his captor and bring him home.All the original cast returns in this sequel, and some new cast members appear as well, including Joan Cusack as Jessie, Kelsey Grammar as the Prospector, and Wayne Knight as Al McWhiggin, the toy collector. All the new voice talents and characters support the old ones as well as help develop them further.This time around, the animation is much improved upon. The characters and environments look more realistic and detailed. Another aspect that is improved upon in this film is the comedy. While the first film is also absolutely riotously funny, the sequel ups the ante a bit, and the film is even funnier than the last one.Overall, Toy Story 2 is a magnificent picture. The writing is tight, witty, and clever throughout, the characters and story are moved forward in a positive direction, and it leaves you feeling good afterward. Another thing I failed to mention in my Toy Story 1 review is the musical score by Randy Newman. I'm personally not a fan of Newman, but his work on the Toy Story films is by far his best work. Toy Story 2 is one of my favorite animated films made, and while it doesn't quite pass up the first, it comes pretty darn close.",10,0,1,3 June 2010
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Great Adaptation
","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the best way to start off the series. The book is filled with wonderful story and great characters. I think that the adaptation of the book was almost exactly the same as the book except for two instances where Neville was either edited out or replaced with Ron. I loved this movie. I remember when it came out, I had a huge fit because I didn't see it on opening day. It was worse for Chamber of Secrets, though. I watched it again, and I noticed it went by much faster than I remembered, but I still think that this movie is a masterpiece. I think that it was cool that they got a movie release so soon after the original novel. I will always love this movie, no matter how flawed it is, although there isn't that many. It's a part of my childhood. Chris Columbus, Steve Kloves, and David Heyman were the dream team of Harry Potter. I loved this movie, flat out loved it.",9,0,1,7 June 2008
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Pretty Good
","Okay, I love Harry Potter. That's a given. But, the thing is, I don't like the fourth book so much. The inside jacket of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire says that it's the pivotal fourth novel. I have to disagree. The only big thing is that they're getting older, and a villain returns to power. Nothing really big. Actually, I think that PoA was more pivotal than this one. However, the movie was actually pretty good. I did like Goblet of Fire, but it's my least favorite entry in the series. But, I liked the way the movie was quite a bit. If the actors could just freeze time, and stay looking this way until the last one is released, I'd like it. They look great in this movie, and their acting is at the top of their game. Ralph Fiennes is scary, noseless, and awesome as Lord Voldemort. The whole graveyard scene was awesome, and I think it's better that they stayed on the ground when Priori Incantatem takes place. The special effects are great, and the movie is all around wonderful. I actually saw this movie 5 times in theaters. I bet the record will be smashed when the seventh ones come out. Yes, there will be two seventh book adaptations. I love the Harry Potter series. J.K. Rowling will never let us down.",8,0,1,7 June 2008
The Matrix Reloaded," Almost Surpasses The First
","Keanu Reeves is back as Neo, the only one who can end the machine war. Again, I was enthralled by the Matrix. We meet the Architect, the creator of the Matrix. We meet Niobe, a fairly uninteresting character played by Jada Pinkett Smith. We meet The Merovingian and Persephone, the cruel Frenchman and his wife. We meet the Keymaker, the one that Neo needs to find to unlock the secret of the Matrix. We meet the Twins, the henchmen of the Merovingian. We meet Link, the replacement for Tank. A bunch of new people come into the series, and not many of them are that interesting. However, I really liked this movie a lot. The story was good, the writing and directing were good, but my favorite element was the progression of the special effects. The special effects were wonderful and the action sequences were wonderful, especially that long-elated battle with the Merovingian's henchmen to take the Keymaker. That freeway chase was absolutely wonderful. I loved this movie, and almost thought it was better than it's predecessor.",8,1,2,9 June 2008
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," A Triumph Over the First
","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a triumph over the first. Harry is warned by a house elf named Dobby not to go to Hogwarts for his second year because he will encounter grave danger. He does when the Chamber of Secrets is opened, Muggleborns are petrified, and Harry is accused of being the Heir of Slytherin. Daniel Radcliffe is a better actor since the first, as are Rupert Grint and Emma Watson. Everyone in this movie is great, as is the young Voldemort. Dobby was pretty cool, and I kind of wish that they kept him for GoF and OotP. As a triumph over the first, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is possibly the best entry in the series.",10,0,1,7 June 2008
Jaws," Can I Rate It 11?
","Jaws. Just saying the title makes John Williams' haunting score ring in my ears. When I first saw this movie when I was 7 years old, my life was changed. I'd never seen anything like it. It was breathtaking. For those who don't know, Jaws tells the tale of three men who set out on a perilous journey to try and stop a killer shark that has been terrorizing a small New England island. For the majority of the film, the shark is never seen. This builds up the tension until the big reveal. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss play the three men who set out to catch the shark, and they all give stellar performances. However, Shaw stands out the most. His speech about the USS Indianapolis is riveting, and each line he gives is perfectly delivered. The film also stars Lorraine Gary as Scheider's wife and the perfectly cast Murray Hamilton as the persistent Mayor Vaughn. The screenplay is written perfectly, and the character development is simply fantastic. Jaws is a great movie, and it will always be one of my favorites.",10,5,11,1 May 2009
The Wrestler," A Brutal, Touching Masterpiece
","The Wrestler is the kind of movie that you will see and remember for the rest of your life. Mickey Rourke plays Randy 'The Ram' Robinson, a famed professional wrestler from the 80's. He's still wrestling today, but when he suffers a heart attack, he is deemed unable to wrestle again for the rest of his life. So, without wrestling, he decides to right the wrongs in his life outside of wrestling. He has a stripper girlfriend played by Marissa Tomei, and she does a fantastic job. Also starring is Evan Rachel Wood, playing Randy's estranged daughter Stephanie. The Wrestler is a fantastic movie. Mickey Rourke's performance is one of the best I've ever seen portrayed on film. Rourke completely immerses himself into the role of The Ram, and I think that he deserved to win an Oscar for this movie. The ending is a fantastic one, and it leaves you thinking. The Wrestler is a brilliant achievement in cinema, and it deserves to be seen by everyone.",10,0,1,1 March 2009
Sherlock Holmes," Clever, Fun, and Very Entertaining
","Sherlock Holmes is one of the most iconic fictitious characters of all time. Created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in the late 1800's, Holmes is an incredible detective who is able to solve a case out of the mundane details in life that nobody else seems to be able to notice. However, prior to this movie, I was not very well-educated on the character. So, I went in with a fresh, open opinion and was very pleased with what I saw. This tells the story of a man named Lord Blackwood, who is supposedly involved in black magic. He is caught by Holmes and his partner, John Watson, early on and is sentenced to death. However, Blackwood is resurrected, and Holmes needs to solve the case. I wasn't so keen on the black magic elements of the story, but when the explanation came at the end, I was really pleased. It made me really appreciate the rest of the film a lot more. I liked the characterization of Holmes, and the mannerisms given to him by the fantastic Robert Downey, Jr. Downey plays Holmes perfectly, getting every little quirk the character has exactly right. There were a number of small things in this movie that I absolutely loved, like the little banter between Holmes and Watson, Holmes and the Inspector. However, what is quite possibly the best thing in this movie is the scenes where Holmes is shown sitting there, but you can hear all the other conversations and noises around him. That is really what defines his character, displaying his brilliance perfectly. There were some problems I had though. The film does run a bit long, and there are a number of scenes that could have been trimmed. The ending is also a big problem. It ends on a cliffhanger, and while I don't mind, I wish they would have saved the cliffhanger stuff for later installments. But, despite that, I really liked Sherlock Holmes, and am looking forward to further installments in this series.",8,4,10,26 December 2009
WALL·E," Pure Cinematic Magic
","I saw this movie and absolutely loved it. Everything about it was purely wonderful. Everything about it is quite wondrous. The story, the characters, the voices, the animation, everything was amazing. WALL-E is a robot who is completely alone on Earth...until humans arrive, taking him on a huge adventure full of excitement, comedy, and romance. I think WALL-E is an amazing movie and may be one of the best movies I have ever seen. WALL-E is pure cinematic magic and should not be missed by any human. I will definitely get this on DVD, and maybe on Blu-ray as well. WALL-E may be Pixar's best movie yet and it's only contender's for a better movie are Toy Story and Ratatouille. WALL-E is great and should not be missed out on.",10,3,6,30 June 2008
Halloween," Genuinely Frightening
","As this film reaches it's 30th anniversary, it doesn't cease to frighten. One of John Carpenter's crowning achievements, 'Halloween' is a movie about how Michael Myers escapes from his mental institution to return home 15 years after killing his sister at age 6. It was amazing to see that the movie could frighten so much without relying on cheap gimmicks such as overuse of blood and gore. As for acting, the best performances come from Jamie Lee Curtis, Donald Plesance, and Charles Cyphers. Donald Plesance is excellent in his first performance as the amazing Dr. Samuel Loomis, who has some of the best dialog in the movie, including the movie's most famous line. Jamie Lee Curtis makes her first on-screen performance in this movie, and it is still great and provides the number one reason as to why she has the title of 'The Scream Queen.' Overall, I loved this film except for the characters of Lynda and Bob, who were rather annoying. The soundtrack was one of the best in a horror film and it's one of the scariest aspects of the film. I absolutely loved this movie and it continues to scare the crap out of me after standing the test of time for 30 years. Halloween is definitely an amazing movie and is one of the best slasher movies ever made.",10,0,1,3 November 2008
Back to the Future Part II," Where We're Going, We Don't Need Roads...
","And so, the adventure continues, thrusting Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) into another trip through time to change the future. After visiting the future, Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) returns to bring Marty to the year 2015 to straighten out the future of the McFly family. However, while they're they're, an event occurs that creates an alternate 1985 where Hill Valley is a hell-on-earth. Now, Doc and Marty must venture back to 1955 again to stop this alternate present from ever existing. However, they mustn't interfere with Marty's previous trip. This movie is non-stop suspense from start to finish. Once it starts, it never lets up and you're constantly on the edge of your seat. However, this sequel doesn't measure up to the first film. Part II has some casting changes that really irritate me, but they're acceptable. The roles in question are small parts anyway, but I still think that Claudia Wells is a way better Jennifer than Elizabeth Shue. The replacement for Crispin Glover is more acceptable, though, because the scenes he's in are so small that if you blink, you'll miss him. Despite it's flaws, Back to the Future Part II is an energetic film that's does what it's supposed to do: entertain.",8,0,0,15 June 2009
Iron Man," Amazing...
","I saw this movie on opening night, not expecting much. The trailers had looked okay from what they showed, but I wasn't planning to like it nearly as much as the first Spider-Man. However, Iron Man may have surpassed Spider-Man. Robert Downey Jr. is absolutely amazing as Tony Stark and completely owns this role. Gweneth Paltrow was great as Pepper Potts, Jeff Bridges was terrifying as the Iron Monger, and Terrence Howard will rock as War Machine in Iron Man 2. The special effects were stunning, and the storyline was gripping. Being Marvel Studio's first film, I will expect quite a bit out of their movies from now on. I'm looking forward to The Incredible Hulk, in which Robert Downey Jr. cameos as Tony Stark in a scene with William Hurt's General Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross. I wish they had the Hulk Buster suit in that movie...but that's unlikely. Overall, I loved Iron Man and recommend it to every comic fan on the planet.",9,4,8,6 May 2008
The Matrix," Whoa!
","I saw this movie a couple of years ago, when all I wanted was to see some people shoot each other and have my mind blown by state-of-the-art effects. I loved it. But, just yesterday, I watched it again. Finally, everything makes much more sense than before. I will be re-watching Reloaded and Revolutions as well, but this is where I'm at. I thought that Keanu Reeves played Neo, who is the only person who can stop the machines from killing the last human city. Laurence Fishburne plays Morpheus, the guy who explains everything about what the purpose of the Matrix is. Carrie-Anne Moss plays Trinity. She is the first character we meet, and starts this movie off with a bang. She's pretty cool. Now, Smith is played by Hugo Weaving, and is part of the Matrix's computer program. He is a cool villain, who is sadly underused. Hugo Weaving is cool and creepy and all around weird. I loved this movie, and I always will. I will always have it in my DVD collection and hope they come out with a 10th anniversary edition next year.",10,0,1,6 June 2008
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Simply The Best Of It's Kind
","Since its release way back in 1977, George Lucas' epic masterpiece 'Star Wars' has gone on to become quite possibly the most popular franchise in motion picture history, with one of the biggest fan followings imaginable. But no matter how much money this franchise makes, or how many people see it, no matter how many sequels or prequels or re-releases or remasters it endures, the original classic still remains to be a very personal film. Despite the success it has undergone since its release, the production of 'Star Wars' was a highly troubled one, many people expecting it to not even get completed at all. The hard work and dedication that Lucas and his cast and crew went through to get this thing made definitely shows through, and that makes the movie all the more endearing to watch. Quite simply, it's an incredible achievement in movie-making.Now, these films have been discussed to death, but I feel like I'd like to give my own two cents on the subject, and my thoughts could easily be summed up in five words: 'Star Wars' is absolutely amazing. Everything about it, from the acting, the effects, the story, the mythos, the music, the incredible intrigue that has keep this series alive for so long, it all started here, and it's great. I don't feel like I need to go too in-depth with a plot summary, because this is one of the most iconic films in history, but basically, 'Star Wars' follows a simple farm boy living on a desert planet named Luke Skywalker, who yearns to fight with the Rebel Alliance against the evil Galactic Empire. Before he knows it, he's thrust into an intergalactic adventure, along with an inventive cast of characters, as he tries to help rescue a princess and destroy the Empire's newest weapon: a space station with the power to destroy planets, called the Death Star.As I said, this movie is awesome. The acting is fantastic all around, each one giving a perfect performance in these incredibly iconic, and unforgettable roles. The inventive special effects are some of the best of their time, and the action sequences are gripping and fantastic, never allowing a dull moment to come through. The story is incredibly fascinating, managing to blend science fiction through the space travel, droids, and aliens, with fantasy through the mystical Force, a defining trait of the Jedi Knights. The intrigue levels are really high here, and it's that intriguing quality that allows viewers to really get invested and really talk in depth about this movie.This film defined a generation. To this day, people still talk about it, and I doubt that it will ever stop being discussed. 'Star Wars' is one of the best sci-fi fantasy epics ever made, and will always be a binding Force of cinema for the rest of time.",10,5,7,5 February 2012
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Ups The Ante In Every Way Possible
","Following the monumental success of 'Star Wars,' this opened up the opportunity for George Lucas to release the final two movies in the trilogy he set out to create. That's not saying that 'Empire' didn't run into its fair share of problems, but regardless, this feels much more polished than 'Star Wars,' and that is saying a LOT.Now, I certainly think that 'Star Wars' is one of the greatest motion pictures of all times, a fantastic, A+, perfect film. The sequel, 'The Empire Strikes Back,' however, is a complete game changer. Everything is bigger and better than ever. The visual effects are superior to the already impressive originals, and the actions sequences are more explosive, but even from a storytelling standpoint, 'Empire' takes things to a whole new level.The story continues with Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, and the rest of the gang at the Rebel base on the ice planet Hoth, but following an attack by an Imperial fleet, the team is split up, with Luke setting out to the Dagobah system to train with the ancient Jedi master Yoda, and the rest of the gang evading capture by the evil Darth Vader, who is back and more villainous than ever. The story this time around is much darker, much more mature, and more fleshed out. It develops the story without being a mere retread of the previous film, and yet, it still maintains that trademark Star Wars feel that made the first one so good. The comic relief is sharper and wittier, the characters are developed in a really natural and fascinating way, and the new characters like Yoda, Boba Fett, and Lando Calrissian also perfectly find their niche in Star Wars lore, fitting in perfectly with the rest.All in all, 'The Empire Strikes Back' takes everything that made the first film so fantastic, and improves it significantly, and then turns it on its head. If 'Star Wars' is one of the best sci-fi fantasy films ever made, then 'The Empire Strikes Back' is THE best sci-fi fantasy film ever made. One of the few perfect films in history. I love this movie, and I can't rave about it enough. It's a classic.",10,0,0,13 February 2012
Back to the Future," Great Scott!
","That's exactly what I said after viewing this movie for the first time years ago. Back to the Future is one of the most successful films of the 80's, and today no film has done better at keeping you on the edge of your seat, and laughing the entire time. Michael J. Fox stars as Marty McFly, an average high school kid of the 1980's who ends up accidentally getting sent back in time to the year 1955 after his friend, Doc Brown (played by Christopher Lloyd) builds a time machine out of a DeLorean. Now, trapped in time, Marty has to find a way to get back into his own time. There's more elements to the plot, but I don't want to spoil the entire movie for you. Most people have probably seen this movie at some point in their life, but if you haven't, it's a must see. It has everything you could want from a movie: comedy, action, suspense, and great special effects for it's time. I love Back to the Future. It's one of my favorite movies, and it definitely deserves recognition as one of the best movies of all time.",10,1,1,15 June 2009
Evil Dead II," Kiss Your Nerves Goodbye!
","Evil Dead II. After Sam Raimi, Rob Tapert, and Bruce Campbell delivered the Ultimate Experience in Grueling Horror, they're back for more with Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn! After losing all his friends to flesh-possessing demons, Ash is forced to continue to hold up in the cabin and fight off the demons. However, when a group of strangers arrives at the cabin, Ash discovers that one of them may hold the key to stopping the demons once and for all.Evil Dead II is a great follow-up to the original gore-fest. The film does change in it's tone, but the dark humor is fantastic. The special effects are also great. The acting is, as like the first, awful. However, Bruce Campbell is perfect.Even though it's been thoroughly explained many times, people still insist that Evil Dead II is a remake. All one should do is skip the first 7 minutes of simplified recap, and watch on. It's a sequel. They didn't add a 'II' at the end just to sound cool.In the first film, Ash was rather wimpy. However, in Evil Dead II, he's just sick and tired of the constant onslaught of demons, and he becomes the ultimate movie badass. From his chainsaw hand to his sawed-off shotgun, Ash is finally the guy that you don't wanna mess with.So, all in all, Evil Dead II is awesome, about on par with the first. It's funny, it's scary, and it's fun as hell. I loved Evil Dead II.",8,0,0,20 May 2009
