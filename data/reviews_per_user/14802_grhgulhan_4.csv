The Avengers," might not be a masterpiece, but its pretty close in its own sense
","i ve seen a couple of negative reviews about this movie in here.. people complain that its not unique like The Star wars, or Matrix or similar movies that came out there with very inventive ideas and gave us something new to think about.. well.. this movie isn't that, and its not supposed to be either.. anyone who is somewhat familiar with comic book characters, do know who these guys are. and for so many years we have been craving !! to see a good flick where they are brought together with good effects, good plot, and good action. the idea has been out there for decades.. we don't want anything new from it, we just wanted what we already know to be presented in a nice package .. and yes.. they did itThe Avengers answers these all.. maybe not to perfection, but far the best so far. i had a great time watching this movie.. i enjoyed the action, i enjoyed how V.S. between heros was incorporated, and i loved the great sense of humor.. i laughed a god damn lot.. and in the end, i was satisfied, and yes, time after time i went back and saw it again.. hell yes.. if a movie makes me do that, in my standards.. its a good one. certain things could have been done better.. of course. i am damn sure that every director watching the final product says the same thing. but it just costs tons of money to go back and shoot a scene again.. that is understood. just to give a general idea from my side1: Loki is too weak.. and does not really pose a challenge. the main threat ends up being hordes of invaders 2: Thor launches a leaping blow with his hammer, and Cappy just blocks it with his shield causing a huge blast of sound waves.. well.. thats a bit silly :) but in the end, he is captain 'America' isn't he !!!3: Thor falling down in the glass cage.. and seemingly that cage was designed to hurt Hulk who happily jumps down that high butt naked anyways.. well doesn't really add up.. 4:the gigantic flying craft .. well.. too much time spent around it, and its not really exciting or convincing at all.. i hoped that it wasn't used at all5: in the end Iron Man falling off the sky is quite a bit 'cliche' but Hulk saving him saves the moment.. who ever thought of that 'bravo'maybe bits and pieces more. but not worth mentioningis this a great movie ? probably no. Is this a great comic movie? Hell Yes !! 9/10 from me Keep up the good work !!",9,1,4,2 November 2012
The Expendables 2," yes you did make them Expendable! what have you done !!!!!!
","What have you done ???? i would have hoped to see Arnie and Chuck in a great movie in, acting respectable characters that suit to their image and legendary movie history... instead,, you brought them back, got us all excited, and then.... then.. nothing.. an empty feeling, where i couldn't be sure whether to love them or pity them... the first movie was OK, it wasn't great, but it wasn't average either. It was fun, had a couple nice surprises, and a bit of a sense of humor. what you guys don't get is.. just because we liked a bit of hot spice yesterday.. doesn't mean we want to pick a large bottle of Tabasco and go bottoms up ... Certain things are only nice when in moderation. in 1st movie it was good.. in this movie.. at most cases it wasn't funny anymore, it was ridiculous.. there is a very fine line between the two, and Hollywood usually doesn't get that. I will never forget near ending, where everyone lined up shooting in slow motion... what a terrible terrible sight.. goodbye Arnie Goodbye Chuck This wasn't how i wanted to see you guys probably the last time.",3,1,2,20 October 2012
Looper," nice but has its LoopHoles
","it's not an easy thing to shoot a time travel movie.. no matter what you do, it always gets messed up. in Looper, i think they pretty much managed to keep the focus away from the time travel complications.. but it doesn't make the experienced viewer say 'hang on' . But over all i have to say the concept is creative enough and does rise enough attention to keep you watching. i would say the time sequence in the movie is flawed. it oddly jumps back and forth, making you feel as if its rushed and they just want go get done with certain parts. it jumps forth making you think that they will fill the gap with a nice surprise, but it doesn't happen. it just flashes back and you ask 'what just happened?' it is worth a watch, but its nothing like 'source code' or 'limitless' or not even 'Surrogates' there unfortunately isn't any decent element of surprise.. and majority of the plot is pretty much predictable. i don't want to go into details.. overall the movie didn't impress me in any particular way at all. its neither a success nor a shame. worth a couple bucks to see on screen. i would have given this a 6, but seeing how crappy movies rated here, i think it deserves a 7",7,1,3,24 October 2012
Mad Max: Fury Road," rating shows how pathetic modern audience is
","this movie is an utter garbage, nothing about art, nothing about acting, nothing about a decent plot, and nothing about logic... the fact that it is being liked by younger audience is a solid proof how PATHETIC film watchers have become, and crashing a few fancy toys in an absolutely lunatic way is enough to make people bite their ears and go 'cooooooolllllll' as years go by i am simply disgusted how a great audience of adult- children were formed, how film makers are abusing and farming this heads on, and there aren't simply enough people with brains left to form a decent population to show that this won't work... or it isn't right... there was a time in past, where film makers felt the responsibility of educating and leading the people.. not farming them like a herd of cattle...",1,40,82,24 June 2015
