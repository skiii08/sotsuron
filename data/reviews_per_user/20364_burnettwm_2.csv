The Lobster," Started out interestingly, but went nowhere very tediously
","While the film was creative in it setting and filming, the strange dialogue, which helped set a tone, made the interpersonal relationships seem completely forced even when they should not have seemed that way.The worst part is that I watched it until it stopped. It is as if the film maker didn't have an ending to go to, and just go tired of the movie. Unfortunately, that took a long time. As a short, this film might have been remarkable. As a full length feature, it was just tedious and not entertaining.On the positive side, it had a great cast who probably did as much as they could with the material they were given. Yorgos Lanthimos wrote, directed and produced the movie and I'm unlikely to want to go see another movie by Yorgos. It was billed as a wickedly funny romance, but was none of those. I did laugh once. It was a single 'ha', not a 'ha, ha, ha!'Ultimately a waste of time.",1,38,56,4 November 2016
The Finest Hours," Terrific true story - not a great job of retelling it.
","The effects are great. But, the directing was pretty poor. Chris Pine plays the hero Bernie Webber and spends an inordinate amount of screen time at the wheel of this little boat in the middle of a raging gale looking down at nothing. The compass is gone, so he's literally looking down at nothing. In real life he'd never take his eyes off the churning water around him. Very poor directing and way too much melodrama. Too bad because the real story is one of the U.S. Coast Guard's most amazing and mostly successful rescue missions in history. The best actor in the movie is Casey Affleck who does a pretty good job play the quiet, thoughtful, level-headed crewman aboard the stricken tanker.",2,2,6,17 July 2016
