Requiem for a Dream," Leaves you with a funny feeling
","As I was reading through most of the other reviews listed on IMDB, most of them dealt with the fact that this movie was about drugs and addictions. Personally, I don't feel this was the directors intention, and I wouldn't consider this as much of a drugs movie, as it is more of a full-scale drama about the loss of hope.  The plot revolves around four people, Sarah, Harry, Marion, and Tyrone, who each have their own sense of innocence and each have personal dreams about their futures at the beginning of the movie.  The three youth have already experimented with drugs and their addictions only strengthen as the movie moves along, making the relationships more tense and the dreams further away.  The older Sarah is especially a touching character, as she doesn't learn she is taking speed until she is addicted, eventually becoming a slave to the pills and becoming what Harry had warned her about.  Aronofsky put together a perfect compilation of scenes for the climax at the end of the film and capped it all off with the final Tappy Tibbons scene that just left me feeling so empty I was ready to cry.  I would recommend this movie to anyone and will stand behind it in any discussion.",10,0,0,22 September 2001
Requiem for a Dream," The best movie you've never seen, just make sure you're ready.
","This movie, without a doubt, is the greatest masterpiece ever created. Everything is perfection from the cinematography to the acting, and even the camera stylings of Darren Aronofsky.  The greatness of this movie, however, comes at a price that involves images and situations some people just can't handle (which I personally think is the cause for the majority of the bad reviews).  The visuals used in this movie to depict each character and their fate are each revolting in their respective manner, but are also necessary for the film to feel real.  There is nothing fake about this movie, it doesn't glamorize life and show how great everything is and how wonderful life is, this movie does the opposite and drags you down into the gutters and forces you to look into the faces of the weak, of the homeless, and of the hopeless.      That being said, Requiem For a Dream revolves around the lives of four Coney Island individuals, each one unique in their own way, and each one with their own demons to face.  Tyrone, who is driven by images of himself pledging to his mother he won't be a failure.  Marion, who is estranged from her parents after the flood her with money but no emotional value.  Harry, who resorts to repeatedly stealing his mothers television in order to buy his next fix.  And finally, Sara, who is plagued by lonliness and sees her chance to escape by losing weight for her spot on a famous television show. Their lives are woven together tightly enough so that when one starts to fall, the rest tumble along at an amazing speed.      This movie, simply put, is perfect.  But as I stated before, that perfection comes at the price of a lot of people not being able to stomach what is happening onscreen.  That is really sad though, because this is one of the greatest movies ever made, and nobody I know has even heard of it. Check this movie out, examine all of the symbolism and make a judgement for yourself.  Just make sure you're ready for some of the things you're going to see.",10,0,1,19 March 2002
8 Mile," Crossroads it is NOT
","Of course I knew who eminem was before seeing this movie, who doesn't? And yes, I heard the talk that this movie was simply another crossroads, a way for the movie studio to make money by putting out a picture featuring a top music star.  The only difference?  This movie is based loosely on Eminem's life, while crossroads...well, any movie with Britney Spears as a valedictorian can't start good or get any better.   Anyways, this movie really suprised me to the fact that it's better than I expected.  Eminem is actually a pretty decent actor, and a person who might not have known anything about his life before this movie might gain some insight into the person behind the music, something people rarely try to understand before judging him.   Other than that, go see this movie and decide for yourself.  If you don't like it, at least have a good reason.  Too many people already discredit Eminem just because of who he is and what he says, they don't look through the act to the person.  After all, look how he treats his daughter, he's a heck of a lot better than most of the deadbeats out there today.",10,0,0,9 November 2002
Donnie Darko," Amazingly Perfect
","Never before have I seen a movie that brings together a story as perfect as this.  Amazingly, this movie runs deeper than any other I've seen before, commenting on the social status of society along with the degradation of the school system, sublimation of people away from heritage and into pop culture, and the effects of the family structure, not to mention theory of time travel.  My words alone, however can't justify the amazing complexion of this film, you just have to see it for yourself.",10,0,0,20 April 2002
