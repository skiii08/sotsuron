Rang De Basanti," Best story ever made into a movie
","I am not sure whether cinema medium have been used like this before. Man, there were many great movies taken before but i am sure never before movie like this,which conveys a great message to its society in a very interesting and effective way. Usually the director who sells the India's poverty were considered best (recently danny boyle). But here is the real talented director who not only shows the problem in our nation but also tried to find the solution hats off sir. Usually we men do not shed tears easily but this movie brought tears in my eyes more than ten occasions . Yeah there were some other movies which brought tears in me like ghost , anbe sivam , titanic but once or twice but this movie? Man i don really have words to explain. Excellent performances by every actors particularly athul kulkarni. The real hero of the movie is director and the second hero is none other than two time academy award winner a.r.rahman what a music can slumdog millionaire's music can stand 1% to this music. It is not the kind of movie that sells the patriotism but teaches it. Man i had wrote many reviews but never said a movie is a must see one but this is 100% must see movie particularly for indians.",10,0,3,21 March 2009
Beauty and the Beast," Really beauty beauty only
","What to say beautifully scripted, directed, scored, film that doesn't fail at any aspect. A beautiful love story that will stand forever i give 9 because there were many more better films than this so only . Overall a good package that should be enjoyed with the family. The main aspect of the film is songs especially beauty and the beast. It doesn't get bored no matter how many times i hear it . The animation was super and characters were created excellently. Sometimes i actually forgot this is animation movie and started loving the beauty. The main drawback i felt movie ended so soon because i don't wanted it to end as i was living in that world. So what are you waiting for see the movie immediately. Was this comment useful please reply so that i might improvise thank you for reading my comment",Null,0,1,20 March 2009
Knowing," Another let down from Mr.Cage
","What happened to Nicholas of moonstruck and national treasure he gave a woody performance in this average (numerological?)thriller. Oh nothing new in this flick and a complete let down to Cage fans. Actually 5 writers used in this movie, for what? It too have some good scenes and one or two thrilling moments but for that we cannot tolerate a whole movie. Its plot too similar to various movies we have seen before including his own movie Next. Screenplay also not so good including some awful scenes unnecessary to the plot. Not only Cage non of the actors given their best performances. Background score is OK but it should have been done better considering it is a thriller(not me). Don waste your precious dollars on this movie wait for DVD. And for cage better luck next time please select good movies at least for your fans like me come again with a bang. Please reply my comment is useful or not so that i can improvise.",4,7,19,19 March 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," Indian food cooked by British in US restaurant
","Seeing this movie i overwhelmed with joy.mainly because of music, without that this movie doesn't matter this much. This is not a new story for Indian's like me,but all other aspects were great. surely i didn't thought this kind of film would win Oscar, because it is a complete commercial movie that everyone will like. usually Oscar would be given to serious kind of film . Danny Boyle was great in this movie. The only problem in this film is some scenes degrade our India's prestige. Anyway it is a must see movie. We can forget our sorrows and enjoy that 2 hours.do you need anything more? So see this movie immediately if you hadn't yet.",9,1,3,14 March 2009
