Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Hats off to Lucas!!!
","I found this film very entertaining.  Especially for a film with a character like Jar Jar Binks.  Don't get me wrong, there are times when he does bring humour to the screen, but for the most part I believe Jar Jar should be shot at dawn without any breakfast. One question brought up though... How is it that 20 years before Episode 4, that they are all so elaborate in handling the lightsabres... I might be far fetched, yet you think as someone as young as Luke could do the same as Obi-Wan in ROTJ however...",10,0,0,1 June 1999
