Blade Runner 2049," A Very Long and Boring Film
","Sometimes I really don't get people. This movie got excellent reviews and was ranked very high all over the world. Can anyone tell me why? There's hardly any story, and the little there is, well, it's not enough for such a long movie - a 30 minutes movie would have covered it. The music is terrible. I usually don't notice, but it's just so obvious. It is loud and screechy and over-dramatic. In general, someone thought that adding lot's of rain over a window at night, plus dramatic music, plus actors making mysterious faces is going to be enough as a movie. Basically, that's how you make a soap opera, and that's what we ended up having. The Story itself is downright ridiculous. All the characters are doing things that don't make any sense, and sometimes go against there own interests. I gave the film 3 just because I like Harrison Ford and because there were a few nice frames in the film - there's nothing else really.",3,15,32,8 October 2017
Justice League," That's how a Super Hero film should look like
","First and foremost, that's how you do it. Not too dark not too funny, with heroes who do heroic things and fight epic enemies and battles. I stress this point because to me it seems that most critics don't understand what a super-hero film is about. The epic is not a clich√©' it's a requirement. That's why I hated Logan - I couldn't bare a pathetic Wolverine whining all the time. Regarding the characters: Most are good even a touch cool, and I think Aquaman and Wonder Woman rule in this one. Batman is also good, but I really didn't like the Flash. Barry Alan is a really annoying super-geek who can't find the sun to know where East is, and doesn't bother to ask. The villain Steppenwolf was criticized thoroughly and mostly for good reason. There could be many reasons for why he's come: revenge? atoning for previous failure? but we are left with just 'I love power'. Bottom line, it's a great movie, with great potential for the future. And a final good word for Cyborg. The character and the his future are both worth investigating and are well described.",9,0,2,2 December 2017
