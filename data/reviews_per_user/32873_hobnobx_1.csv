The Mask," Positive review by non-Jim Carrey fan.
","Altho' Mr. Carrey is a fellow Canadian, I have not enjoyed any of his other roles in Hollywood movies. This is a notable exception. There is no question in my mind of Mr. Carrey's abilities, he just seems to have starred in movies I was not interested in. Hats off to Jim Carrey.",8,0,0,7 August 2002
