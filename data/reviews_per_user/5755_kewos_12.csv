Changeling," As usual... Clint Eastwood as director is a secure bet.
","I have to admit that I've always liked Clint Eastwood as a director. He never lets me down and 'Changeling' it isn't been an exception. At the same time I'm not a fun of Angelina Jolie but I have to admit I had to like her this time (not sure as everybody say worth an Oscar, but really good acting).Based in real event, and knowing what is this film about, means is gonna be a super-drama and it's. I always said that a good movie, liked or not, makes you feel things. And this one delivers Frustration, rage, impotence and shame and at the same time overcoming, hope and a deserved final justice.Great directing and acting, not just Angelina Jolie, all the cast. Superb recreation (portrait) of LA city and society in the 30-40's. Just mention is 137 min long and under my point of view the last 20/30 min could be taken out. Doesn't contribute at all in the story and the truth is, after the trial, it becomes slower and a bit pointless.Anyway, I can't wait to watch 'Gran Torino'.Overall a fair 7.5/10 and a well worth drama to watch.",7,5,7,16 January 2009
3:10 to Yuma," Shame of a stupidly quick thought end. Very entertaining rest of film!
","I wanted to see this movie after reading all the good reviews it have and it didn't disappointed me. I'm not a big fan of western although lately there've been a few good ones.As usual, there's the good guy, the bad one and a mission to be done. The fact is the bad guy is not than bad and the good one is strong enough to keep going in his mission under any circumstances. Both actors gives intensity, both can transmit a lot without saying a word plus they deliver good performances. Dialogues are well written, shooting work is brilliant, well done action scenes and outdoors.This remake is more cynic, brutal and faster than its predecessor in 1957.I don't rate it higher cause in my point of view there're 2 things could have been improved: - In the original one (1957) the countdown of the hours till 3:10 train is much better. The tension, the stress to get on time, etc. That is lost it this one, not at least with the same intensity.<ul><li>Shame of a stupidly quick thought end. Very entertaining rest of film!</li></ul>All in all, is a very recommendable western. A good popcorn movie. Enjoy!!7.5/10",7,1,2,21 January 2009
Skyfall," Bond 50th anniversary couldn't been worst
","Firrst of all I will say that I was a Bond fan in my youth but to me Bond died with Roger Moore. I stopped watching Bond movies for a while after seeing Timothy Dalton's. Then, after reading some reviews, and because I liked him as Remington Steele, I decided to give Goldeneye I chance (big mistake) and then once more with Casino Royale and this last one. Without loosing Bond identity features, its roots, I would expect the scriptwriters to squeeze their brains a bit more cause today is not enough if you make a cocktail with just a sexist man, a fancy car, a pretty girl, some random killing and action and a villain (shaken or stirred) and serve it thinking that as the ingredients are good anything with them in it is gonna be tasty and good, wrong! I need a more elaborated plot. Is like having a carpet in the kitchen or in the bathroom, sure 50 years ago was fashionable in UK but today I just do not want it.Reviews were good so I decided to go. Also for its 50th Anniversary, for Bardem, for Scotland. I liked the tributes made to the first Bond movies, I liked Bardem in his first 10 min but then as the story cannot be more absurd there's no way the actors can hold the movie. At some point I thought I could be yet surprised when action is translated to Scotland: 'could it be? Will Sean Connery make a surprise cameo?' After all the tributes at least I could have given that to the movie, a nice surpricse and the ability to laugh at themselves but not, wasn't Sir Connery, WASN'T even Scottish!! I tend to take now 007 as a joke, a comedy, a bad action movie and even worst thriller and I will try to refrain myself of watching next 'best bond' movie yet to come as that was 50 years ago. I will go to the pub instead and ask for a martini, shaken not stirred.",3,3,8,22 December 2012
Silent Hill," Nice surprise. Solid fantasy thriller movie.
","I knew Silent Hill is originally a video game although I 've never played so I decided to watch it with a very open minded and no prejudices at all. In result I have found a good film. Astonishing shots. Certeanly you can notice where it comes from cause I could picture in my mind how must be playing the game . Is visually amazing. And the storyline is pretty good too.I felt trapped in it right from the beginning. All casting give solid performances. The mist in Silent Hill is more creepy and add more atmosphere than the 'The Mist' itself by far. The atmosphere in general is great. It doesn't try to give you cheap frights like most of American horror movies. I'm not a big fun of violence in horror/thriller movies but watched this a fantasy thriller tale I didn't mind that much. Plus, I don't know the video game so I can't judge.Weakneses.. yeah, there are. Dialogues could have been better. Plot could be better explained (for those who doesn't know the game), more in depth but in general it's been a nice surprise. Comparing another recent horror movies reviews with this one For me this is a bit above the average.",7,0,1,20 January 2009
The Mist," I expected a lot more.
","OK, I'm not a big fan of Stephen King's movies made. Except the Green Mile and Misery and after watching this I will stick to those two.The plot sounds good. A mysterious mist wrap the city and you don't know why but is not good. Well, The Mist lasted for me 20 min. Once you know what is out there the movie lose everything. I've seen recently Silent Hill and the mist there provided more atmosphere than here. Especial Fx aren't good neither, even bad. Actually, the horror is inside the store. With Marcia Gay Harden (Mrs. Carmody) performing than good that you wanna kill her in her second line. Reading the book you feel claustrophobic, you want to get out of the store watching what's happening inside too but you are scare of what's outside. I didn't get that feeling neither in the movie. I didn't care at all.It's predictable, lame, flat and it didn't get me at any moment but hey, is just me. The final twist, I have to admit, took me by surprise, you don't expect it at all.If I would have gone to theatre to watch it I would have felt swindled. Instead I rented and after 10 minutes I completely forgot the movie. It could have been better, much better. If you have a flat brain day and you like horror movies go for it. It last 2 hours and you won't have to think for that time.",4,2,5,21 January 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A weak cocktail between Forest Gump, English Patient and The Notebook...
","I will try to give my review of this film and apologised in advance for my English but I will try best.When a short story is put in on the big screen and it last for almost 3 hours better you make a good entertaining piece of film... If it's a runner for 11 awards of the academy you expect to watch a piece of art cause potentially it could win all of them. Well I just see one Oscar coming and it's a make-up or special effects. Apart from that nothing but a fairy tale with flaws if we take the movie seriously.I won't named all of them. You can read it in other reviews and I don't want to be that critic. Just say that beside the story (a baby born old and getting younger with years) there's nothing new. Even more is a cocktail between Forest Gump, the English patient and Notebook all blended together and adding a lot of water. As a results you got a weak cocktail nothing remarkable, not to be the cocktail of the year at least.The plot focused mainly in two aspects; Benjamin Button getting younger which is probably the most attractive point in the movie and a weak and impossible love story due to his condition. Well, all the where abouts of his re-born life is not as good as in Forest Gump (speaking from a tale point of view) but as the movie can't deliver an appropriate drama feeling there's no other way to watch it. The drama fails as well in the love story. You care a bit but is predictable and you can recognised a lot of scenarios from previous films. All the story love comes from a diary, the be loved woman dying in bed and remembering her past and so on.Performances are OK and the truth is I was entertained for almost 3 hours even when some times is slow or you could have cut a few minutes or define better the plot, either just a tale story or drama love story but not in half way of both. Or you could make characters in more depth. Despite of all is a watchable movie just not expect the movie of the year. See it with an open mind and ready to enjoy and it will make its work. Do some popcorn too!!",6,0,2,1 February 2009
Taken," Great action-thriller movie.
","I have to admit that probably thrillers are my favourite genre plus I like Liam Neeson and when I can see him in a good thriller movie I like it double. Saying this, and if you like this genre too, you will agreed that is difficult to find out one that it keeps you on the edge of your seat for the whole movie. That's one of those difficult ones to find out. Probably in the mix there's more of an action movie than a thriller but still a very enjoyable piece. Everything goes to fast, straight-forward. You don't have time to breath. It's true that it doesn't allow you to play with the movie cause it gives you no time to think. Don't look here for a psychological thriller cause is not. Is pure tension, action, suspense and high levels of adrenaline.Better than any 'Bourne' movies, million times better than any '007' ones (at least for me). Make some popcorn, sit and relax (if you can). 8/10.",7,1,3,12 January 2009
The Wrestler," A lesson of good cinema!!
","The issue is common in every sport men life: 'It's time to leave. Where I can go now?' And Aronofsky reflects it perfectly with his narrative in the movie. The Wrestler shows how the story of the boxer whose career is over (or almost) still work out for the audience. OK, technically he's not a boxer is a wrestler but it makes no difference in the story.Randy Robinson (Rourke) is a wrestler at the end of his career. Fighting in 3rd category rings when he was a star in the 80's. One day he has a heart attack and doctors recommend not to go into a ring again and then is when he look around and realised he has no more in his life but wrestling, he's alone and not rich precisely. He will try to do the right things in his personal life when he couldn't do it before. The main character role is perfect for M. Rourke. Maybe cause he was (or he tried) to be a boxer in the 80's. Even Rourke admit this role has a lot to do with his career back then. He knits it to perfection, it's a superb performance by Mickey Rourke. I haven't seen yet other candidates to the Oscars award but he deserves to be nominated for sure. And then you have Pam (Marisa Tomei) the stripper and mother of two son also at the end of her career and in need of changes in her life. Marisa Tomeis is also amazing performing as stripper.This movie is a classic and it works so good. Aronofsky finds again the right way to relate the story. A bit depressive some times but isn't new in his movies. The scenes on the ring are incredible. Simple, no tricks but among 'Raging Bull' one of the best I've eve seen. You will get hooked watching this. I would recommend without doubts. Just have the day to watch a good drama. 8/10",8,0,1,22 January 2009
Prometheus," Grab a big pack of popcorn...
",".. so it can last for 2 hours cause is the only good thing you will have in that time.I was looking forward to see this movie. Well, I will resume this movie in 7 lines: <ul><li>2 hours of tediousness. </li></ul><ul><li>The script is poor, too poor. </li></ul><ul><li>Acting, cannot judge it cause the actors didn't have enough material. </li></ul>-Mr Scott.. what the hell is this? I guess you were thinking only in making money without bother in the script, the plot, everything. <ul><li>Huge disappointmen. I will think it twice before going to see your </li></ul>Blade Runner's sequel.",3,6,14,5 June 2012
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," as in the movie 'It's good but there's no salt in it'
","I always liked Allen and being myself Spanish and the movie being shot in Barcelona well... It was a 'must see' to me. After 90 min I can recall is not the best movie of Allen by far. Is not the worst neither. Is like he had to made it so he threw up an average script, hired good actors and set up some 'typical Spanish' locations and scenarios.There's the mostly unnecessary voice-over narration that fills in expository gaps. C'mon Allen, you have 4 fine actors who could have done it with no needs of this voice and it would allowed to go into the characters more deeply. Dialogues are just fine speaking of Woody Allen. Not as sharp or intelligent as used to be. A master in 'Catalan Identity'? Uummm... well. And how about a master in 'butifarras'? (catalan sausage). The pretext could have been better but it doesn't actually matter. It has no relevance in the movie. I have to say this movie is not about Spain or Barcelona. Barcelona is the scenario that's all. Some actors are Spanish playing Spanish. I can't understand why people is complaining about not being the real Spain what's is portrayed. This movie is about the story of one summer in Barcelona. Could be anywhere. And that's the way you have to watch it.Javier(what an actor!!), Scarlett and Cruz are all good, but it is Vicky character (Rebecca Hall) who stands out giving such depth.I've criticized enough this film but probably cause I expected a bit more. It has its points too. However I rarely find a film of Allen that isn't worth seeing The film is enjoyably light.",6,1,5,28 January 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," A nice fairytale movie.
","I went yesterday to watch this movie. I had read some critics and I decided to give it a try and after 2 hours I left the theatre with a mix of feelings. First of all I have to admit that If the movie had been 100% American. Meaning that actors, and scenes had been shot at any place in Europe or America the movie would have been completely forgettable. Liked or not, and in my point of view (being European) see some Indian stuff everywhere made this movie enjoyable and I'm not going to judge now if it's or not realistic.Saying that I liked the movie. Don't watch it as a masterpiece or under any big spectations cause in that case it will failed. Watch it as a fairytale based in India. With bad guys, good ones, love and almost impossible endings. The movie doesn't pretend to show us India in deep but it gives you brushes of it and that Boyle makes a really good work with the camera.The movie is predictable, indeed it is. That is not realistic, probably it is not. But it touches you. Makes you feel different feelings along the movie. It reminds me a bit to the first story in 'Amores Perros' ('Love's a bitch' in the English market) with a happy ending. And in India of course!!Worth to watch it. 7/10.",7,1,3,12 January 2009
V for Vendetta," One of the best movies of the year.
","I didn't know what to expect of this movie when I watched. I had no idea it came from a graphic novel and suddenly and after those words 'Remember, remember the fifth of November...' I couldn't believe I was watching one of the best movies of the year. It was a really nice surprise. Since then I might have watched it at least 10 times. Is one of those you don't mind to watch it from time to time.The plot is simple but at the same time powerful and can't leave you indifferent on the matter. Same one as the 1984 novel. A corrupted system, a lack of freedom to express any idea against the system, a big brother who controls everything and everybody in orther to keep the lambs under control and in the other hand the mind, the soul and the person who wants to remind us that to feel or think is a all right. The one who suffered on his own skin the atrocity of the system to reach the power and absolute control of mankind. Is a story of revenge is a fight against the corrupted system, a fight pro-freedom, it's.. a Jewell of cinema.Great casting, great portrayals, superb performances by every single actor, solid action, good scenes, powerful main character, good dialogues and a well done and deep plot which makes you think, depth characters so u can identify with them .. what else can you ask for? Is one of these movies which leaves you with an incredible sensation after watched it. Satisfaction.I can only say: Watch this movie cause you won't be disappointed. Even when u are not into movies which come from comic. You won't noticed. 9/10",9,3,10,14 January 2009
