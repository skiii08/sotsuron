Ford v Ferrari," A movie about friendship, determination and the contrast between artists and businessmen
","Eventhough it might look like another generic racing movie, Ford v Ferrari is actually a very engaging and emotional story about two people who work against the various obstacles they face in order to achieve their aim. The performances by Christian bale and Matt Damon were top notch and both their characters are throughly fleshed out. The storyline involving Miles's family was also executed very well and helped in further developing his character. The hard work done by Miles, Shelby and their team, in order to win the race at Le Mans as well as the constant interferences from the executives, form the central narrative of the movie. The movie portrays the contrasting perspectives of both these sides quite well. The racing sequences were directed magnificently by Mangold and keeps you at the edge of your seats. It was done primarily using practical effects and very little CGI and its impact is clearly feltThere are a few cliches that we usually see in biopics like this. There are also a few parts where we might find it predictable. But other than that, it's an engaging and excellently crafted movie that keeps you engrossed from the beginning, with well developed characters and a lot of heart",8,3,8,23 November 2019
Hereditary," Everything I wanted from a horror movie
","Let me start off by saying that I am not a big horror fan. Horror is the most subjective genre and different people get scared by different things. I personally don't find find modern horror movies like the conjuring, insidious etc scary. So I am happy that I finally found a movie that actually scared and deeply disturbed me in a really long time.The best aspect of this movie was how complex and well written the main characters were, compared to the poorly written, bland, boring one-dimensional stupid teenagers that we are so used to seeing in modern horror movies. Another great aspect of this movie were the feelings of sadness and dread that is present throughout the movie. This movie has some really scary sequences which involves slowing building tension and dread without relying on cheap jump scares. The themes of grief, depression, mental illness and loss were incorporated very well into the story in a metaphorical manner. Toni Colette's performance was the best I've seen all year and it's a crime that she wasn't nominated for an oscar.However I felt that, a small aspect during the climax could've been presented in a better manner. The naked cult members during the end turned out to be unintentionally funny instead of creepy and came close to ruining the atmosphere of the scene.Overall I think this is one of the best horror movies of this century right next to the witch, tumbbad, babadook etc.",10,0,3,28 October 2019
The Irishman," Scorsese has done it again
","This movie proves that Scorsese is probably the only director of his generation who can still create masterpieces like this, at this age. He has managed to stay as relevant as he was during the 70s and 80s, without being overshadowed by the new and young filmmakers. The Irishman definitely ranks among the very best of his filmography.Eventhough there are a few familiar faces and tropes from Scorcese's older movies like Casino and goodfellas, the Irishman is distinctively different from those movies in its themes. While we see Henry Hill from goodfellas look back at his gangster life as something he deeply loved and missed, here we see Frank Sheeran facing the pain, guilt and regret that his actions has brought upon him because of the life he chose. The movie also deals with complex themes such as loyalty, death, friendship and guilt. Frank Sheeran's life as a hitman and his relationships with Jimmy hoffa and Russell Buffolino forms the central narrative of the movie. Steven Zaillian's exceptional screenplay, Scorcese's direction and the performances, managed to thoroughly flesh out the characters and their relationships. Despite being over three hours long, the movie successfully keeps us engrossed from beginning to end. The performances by De Niro, Pacino and Pesci are top notch and are among the best in their entire career. Joe Pesci, who steals every scene he is in, proves his incredible range and versatility as he plays Russell Buffolino, who is nothing like the hot-headed psychopaths he is known for playing in goodfellas and casino. Seeing these legends together in which could probably be their last on screen performance together, was incredibly delightful.The digital de-aging was extremely well done for the most part, eventhough it is slightly noticeable in a few scenes. There is also a scene where where De Niro's body movements clearly resembles an old man. But that is such a trivial issue and wasn't distracting due to the incredible performances, direction and screenplay",10,3,9,6 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A little messy and inconsistent at times, but overall a satisfying conclusion to the skywalker saga
","It is pretty evident from the beginning that there wasn't an overall plan for the trilogy before production began. There are certain plot points that come out of nowhere without any set up from previous movies. The main examples being the return of Palpatine and the retconing of Rey's parentage. Palpatine's return was so abrupt and it is clearly understood that it wasn't something they had planned before. Rey's parents being no one was an interesting plot point and it fit her arc well in the last jedi, but that aspect was altered in order to please the fans. There are also a few other examples which showcases the conflicting ideas of Rian Johnson and JJ Abrams. The constant mcguffin chases in the first act become a little tiring after a while. The part where they discover the assassins ship and the dagger felt like a very convenient coincidence and was just lazily written. Palpatine's plan is all over the place and doesn't make much sense.That being said, the movie also has a lot of positive aspects as well. The character arcs of Kylo Ren and Rey were executed perfectly. There was great chemistry between the lead characters although some relationships should have been more fleshed out, since they lack an emotional impact, especially the relationship between Rey and Leia. The performances by the entire main cast were top notch, especially Adam Driver as Kylo Ren who is without a doubt, the best aspect of the sequel trilogy. The fan service was handled very well and was mostly interwoven with the main plot, although it might feel slightly pandering at times. The action sequences and visuals were among the best in the entire franchise.The concept of the force was explored through some new and interesting ways, which gave us some great sequences. The sendoff given to Luke, Leia and Han were also executed well.Eventhough the plot is slightly messy and inconsistent with the previous 2 movies, the rise of Skywalker is still a highly entertaining and satisfying conclusion that may not have utilized it's full potential",6,2,7,22 December 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino's most personal movie
","If you watch this expecting a typical Tarantino movie, you will probably end up being disappointed. This movie has a lot of Tarantino's trademarks but it also happens to be very different compared to the rest of his filmography.The focus of this movie are the 2 main leads, a 'has-been' television star and his loyal stunt double and their lives during 1960s Hollywood. This movie is Tarantino's tribute to the time period similar to how Roma was to Alfonso cuaron. These 2 characters are actually plot devices used to represent how things were back then. The relationship between these 2 characters is the heart of the movie and I will definitely watch hours of them just talking to each other about random stuff, because of how well written they are. Their individual subplots are equally entertaining. The ending was pure Tarantino and was the highlight of the movieWhen it comes to the negative aspects, I personally didn't like the way Sharon Tate was included in the movie. I completely understand why she's in this movie but it would've been better if she was a little more involved with the storyline of the 2 main leadsOverall this movie was amazing and it's my third favorite Tarantino movie after django unchained and inglorious basterds",9,2,5,28 October 2019
1917," A visually stunning and emotionally impactful masterpiece
","Despite being an year stacked with amazing movies, none of them managed to touch me as emotionally as this movie did. Directed magnificently by Sam Mendes, 1917 engrosses you and keeps you at the edge of your seats from the very beginning as the tense atmosphere and a constant sense of danger are maintained throughout the movie. The characters are not portrayed as invincible heroes but as regular young men who are trapped in this situation, fighting a pointless war. The character development for the two main leads was done subtly but very effectively, with limited exposition. The performances by George Mackay and Dean Charles Chapman were top-notch and makes us really empathize with their characters. The cinematography by Roger Deakins was nothing short of breathtaking. The one-shot technique makes the experience much more immersive as we feel as if we are present there along with the characters. The score by Thomas Newman was phenomenal and helped to elevate the impact of several scenes. Another noteworthy aspect of the movie was its incredible production design, particularly the battlefield and the abandoned town, which showcases some of the most impressive set constructions of the year. The sound design was outstanding and further helped to convey the intensity of the situation.The focus is less on the battle and more on the suffering, destruction and loss caused by war. The soldiers in the movie themselves comment on the pointless and destructive nature of war. The incredible screenplay, direction and performances manage to present this theme in an emotionally impactful manner",10,11,17,6 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A mixture of good and bad writing and a lot of wasted opportunities
","Never before have I felt such conflicted feelings towards a movie. On one hand, there are moments of genuinely brilliant filmmaking and on the other, there are some bafflingly stupid moments that makes you wonder how this was made by the same director.Let's start with the positives. This movie deals with some really mature themes such as failure, letting go of the past, leadership etc. These themes were utilized very well to fulfill the arcs of Luke, Rey and Poe. Kylo Ren is arguably the most complex and well written character in the franchise. The lead performances, especially by Mark Hamill and Adam Driver were top notch. Rian Johnson's visual style is evident throughout the movie. The technical aspects like the production design, vfx, cinematography etc were outstanding and this is probably the most visually stunning star wars movie ever.As a negative, there are instances where good storytelling is sacrificed for the sake of the theme. This is most evident in the scene where Rose saves Finn and says the much maligned, 'saving what we love' line. This was an excellent message but it is misplaced and doesn't fit innthe context. The light speed ram is probably the most visually stunning moment in the franchise, but since it was done by a poorly written character like Holdo, it wasn't very effective emotionally. Rose was another underdeveloped character. The casino sequence was poorly executed and doesn't fit in this movie. It was very reminiscent of earth and I wish they could've done something a little more creative. The force awakens provided numerous opportunities to expand the story. But this movie wasted a lot of potential and instead of building up on TFA's story, it feels like it tried to be its own thing. Another aspect was the humour, which didn't suit the movie very well and caused some tonal inconsistencies.I can clearly understand the divisive response this movie received. The main storyline which includes Luke, Rey and Kylo Ren was excellently crafted and incredibly satisfying. Eventhough I really liked this movie, I won't ignore the numerous flaws and wasted opportunities throughout the movie",6,2,6,30 October 2019
There Will Be Blood," An in-depth character study of a man driven by his unending desire for control
","The movie deals with the competitive and manipulative nature of men and the desire for total control. Daniel Day Lewis, in his Oscar winning role, gives one of the best performances in cinema history as he plays Daniel Plainview, an oilman who is willing to do whatever it takes to eliminate any possible competition against him, in-order to attain total control. He employs whatever means necessary, regardless of how vicious it may be, for achieving his goal. He is disgusted by the idea of someone else attaining a similar status as his. He even goes as far as denying the existence of God, inorder to cement his position at the top. Eventhough it results in him being an extremely successful businessman, his deeds eventually destroys him emotionally and psychologically. Day Lewis once again proved that he is one of the most versatile actors ever as he completely disappears in the role, giving us one of the most memorable movie villains ever.Another remarkable performance was from Paul Dano who plays a priest named Eli Cash. Dano manages to shine bright, despite sharing screen with a legend like Day Lewis. Despite being very different individuals, Daniel and Eli are essentially two sides of the same coin since their ultimate goals are the same. Eli as a priest, manipulates the people of his town using their superstitious religious beliefs, in-order to establish himself as a commanding figure.Written and Directed exceptionally by Paul Thomas Anderson, the movie hooks you and keeps you engrossed throughout its whole runtime without a single dull moment. The cinematography by Robert Elswit, which won a well deserved Oscar, was genuinely mindblowing. Another praiseworthy aspect was its incredible production design which manages to successfully recreate the time period of the early 1900s. The score by Johnny Greenwood was also fantastic. All these aspects combined with the magnificent performances by Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano helped the movie to cement its position as one of the greatest movies ever made.",10,1,1,11 April 2020
Joker," A deeply disturbing psychological thriller which deals with some mature themes
","This is a mature and complex psychological thriller disguised as a comic book movie. Joaquin Phoenix, one the greatest actors working today gives one of the best performances of his entire career. He once again proves his incredible range as an actor. He had big shoes to fill and he absolutely delivered. Todd Philips proves his versatility as a director, since this is a genre that he didn't have much experience with before.It tackles some very relevant themes such as class divisions, loneliness, poverty and mental illness and all these themes were incorporated very well without being too on the nose. The incorporation of the Wayne family was also done very well, eventhough some people had issues with this aspect. The background score and cinematography were amazing and really helped to elevate certain scenes.A lot of people had criticized the numerous similarities to taxi driver and the king of comedy. I am personally okay with some of these, since this was openly stated by the filmmakers and were intended to be homages. However at times the similarities are too obvious and it almost feels like a remake of taxi driver. I was hoping that the homages should've been presented in slightly more subtle manner so that the movie didn't have to lean so heavily on taxi driver",9,5,8,28 October 2019
