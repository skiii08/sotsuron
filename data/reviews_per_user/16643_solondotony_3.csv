It," Manufactured Hype and Rating 'IT'
",Yep you read the title right. No punches pulled. The Movie company bought good reviews and ratings for this movie. 'IT' SUCKS! I left the movie theater 44 minutes in. They want a sequel too!? Yah Hollywood keep pulling these fake reviews and ratings next time I will find a bootleg copy of the next movie ! IT is complete garbage,1,23,47,12 September 2017
Joker," Time will reflect how truly bad Joker was
","I was so hyped to see this movie considering what DC accomplished with all three Dark Knight movies. I let my guard down when it comes to DC Films, BIG MISTAKEJoker recieved so much hype because the movie studio spent a large portion of Jokers marketing budget engineering public opinion. Its the only rational thing I can think because Joker is nothing but a giant crap. Forty five minutes into the film I wanted to walk out of the movie theaterJoaquin Phoenix would laugh at awkward times and did this alot through the entire film. It never gave you a sense that Joker was starting to crack. Instead you feel that the director was telling Joaquin 'Laugh now' just to remind the viewing audience that Joker is crazy. It was so stupid.Mr. Phoenix is getting so much praise for his portrayal of Joker yet to be totally honest it stunk. Heath Ledger's joker was better and more realistic. In fact all three dark knight movies were better than Joker in every aspect especially the realism department.Joker is one of those movies that 3 months from now when the movie studio has stopped the social media manipulation the truth of how bad the movie really is will shine through.Congratulations DC you Hoodwinked Comic book movie nerds once again including me.",1,23,80,8 October 2019
Wonder Woman," Boring!
","Wonder Woman was boring. I absolutely love superhero films. This was just an Industry cookie cutter film. No substance bland and boring. I did expect it going into this film based off of B vs S and suicide squad. I didn't trust my gut and they got my money and my money.When Gal Gadot (wonder woman) decided to leave the Amazonean Island in search of David Thewlis (Sir Patrick) Wonder woman's mom was just like 'ok see ya later'. It really was just an emotionless scene. To top that off Wonder woman does not say goodbye to any of the other Amazoneans. Just so emotionless! Did wonder woman even have a best friend on the Island, Jeez! Anyway I knew right then I should have gotten up and walked out.Like I said cookie cutter. The fight scenes weren't even that good to me. In fact they were rather boring! You got me on Wonder Woman the DC movie I will wait for non professional reviews on the next one.",2,3,12,15 September 2017
