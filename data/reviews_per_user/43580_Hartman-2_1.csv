Antz," This is a very interesting film if you can overlook the language.
","I viewed this film by myself on the Wednesday before it opened and was really interested in the film until the Stallone character used the h--- word.  Now it was clear why it did not receive a G rating, however, the rest of the film was very good.  I don't know why they put in the 4 or 5 uses of bad language but if you can overlook that, I recommend seeing it.  The patrons at the theatre I work at have seemed to disregard the language content of the movie saying 'my kid's here worse on TV' but there were a few that decided to leave changing over to The Parent Trap instead (The only other PG or G movie we had).The movie itself is really good.  The computer animation is not PIXAR (Disney) calibre but a close (very close) substitute.  I will be really interested to see future releases from Dreamworks animation (Such as The Prince of Egypt in December). Also, this movie actually has somewhat of a story.  It's not just a bunch of bugs dancing around.  See this movie if you can, and if you're worried about your kids--watch it first before you take them and form your own opinion about the content.",8,0,0,4 October 1998
