Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A Cringeworthy Classic!
","If you enjoyed Ali G's technique of trying to trick people into revealing their prejudices by pretending to be stupid, then you'll love this film! It's pretty much the theme throughout, with some people clearly better at playing the Politically Correct game than others! You can see why the Kasakhstan government got so upset about it though: If a person was gullible enough to believe that this was a real documentary, they would get a pretty terrible impression of Kasakhstan! Basically, you get from this film just what you would expect from Sacha Baron Cohen: Knuckle-biting embarrassment punctuated by explosive laughter. The man is a genius!",10,2,13,6 November 2006
