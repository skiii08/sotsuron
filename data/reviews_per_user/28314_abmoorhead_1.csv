The Incredible Hulk," Incredible Hulk; Cool action sequences meets worst screen play ever written
","The Incredible Hulk is a very confusing movie. Not because of the plot, but because for every moment that makes you like this movie, there is an even greater moment that makes you want to leave the theater and demand a refund. Going into the movie, I expected a strong script, and good acting, along with mediocre and boring visual effects. I expected that if Edward Norton was involved, then the acting and screenplay would be good, at least for a superhero flick. And from the previews, I was unimpressed with the visual effects, seeing little improvement from Ang Lee's. But after viewing the movie, I was completely wrongThe action sequences, though mostly just mass destruction, were well done. The Hulk looked great,or at least 10 times better then the previous Hulk. The climactic battle between Hulk and Abomination was especially well done. The visual effects were flawless, and the fighting was very climactic and enjoyable to watch. The other portion of this movie, every part without the big green Hulk, was an Abomination, seriously. The dialouge had absolutely no flow, each scene between Liv Tyler and Edward Norton was extremely painful to watch. In one scene, when Norton is in Tyler's home, and they bump into each other in the hallway. Thus begins the worst acted and written scene in the history of cinema. Some fellow patrons and I found ourselves laughing hysterically at this scene. Since words cannot describe the sheer lunacy of the scene, I advise you to look it up on YouTube and see for yourself. Other incredibly poorly written scenes, ex. all of them, and a few extremely bad cuts and plot holes added to the bad experience. The rest of the movie was so bad, that whenever the Hulk showed up, it felt unnatural, like the screenwriters timed it so that the Hulk would show up in precise intervals throughout the movie, making it seem forcedIn conclusion, bad movie, if you have to seem a superhero movie, see Iron Man, and if you have to see the Incredible Hulk, wait till DVD and fast forward through every part without the Hulk.",4,2,8,15 June 2008
