Captain Phillips," Moderately Entertaining
","This movie left me a little underwhelmed. It was watchable but nothing exciting or amazing. The second half of the movie seems to drag on for far too long. Additionally, I thought the characters weren't developed all that much. Who are these pirates and why do they do what they do? Money, yeah I get that. But I would have liked to see more development. Same goes for the Cap's crew. Who are they? Why should we care if they get captured or killed? The movie doesn't really do a good job of drawing me into the characters or their backgrounds. It plays more like a dramatized news story, or a rescue 911 extended episode. Interesting, but quickly forgettable.I will, however, commend the actors on their fine acting. Especially the final scene in which Tom Hanks really gives a great performance in the one moment the movie actually made me care about anything that was happening on the screen.",6,16,34,24 October 2013
Skyfall," Average Bond Film...Nothing Spectacular
","This film met my expectations, which are never high for 007 films. I expected some action, chase scenes, attractive women and plot twists. I also expected shallow characters and substandard story lines. What I didn't expect was such a slowly developing plot. After the opening chase scene, which is very exciting, the film flat lines for about 30 minutes. Then, we're not introduced to the antagonist until nearly an hour in to the film and his motivations are revealed even later than that. That makes for a difficult film to be drawn into. But script writing has never been the strength of the James Bond franchise. It's best to just sit back and enjoy watching things blow up. Fortunately, the climax of this film has a lot of that to offer.",7,3,9,13 November 2012
Iron Man 3," No plot + No villain + No direction = Big Disappointment
","After watching this movie I'm still not sure what the plot is supposed to be. Is Tony Stark trying to save the world, discover who he is, avenge his friend, save his girlfriend or unravel a sinister plot? None of these themes was developed at all and nothing really holds this movie together or drives the main character forward. Another huge problem is that there's no real antagonist until the last 15 minutes of the movie. Sure, we see clips of some maniac blowing things up but there's no conflict between the good guy and the bad guy until the last few minutes of the film. This film left me feeling empty and disappointed. I'll just have to wait for Joss Whedon and Avengers 2 to get Iron Man right again.",3,4,8,3 May 2013
Gravity," Stunning and Spectacular
","This movie grabs you by the throat and thrusts you into the action like no other movie in recent memory. Never have I felt the sheer terror, the utter horror of the events that unfolded on the screen before me as if I were right there experiencing it. This is a testament to the fantastic writing and phenomenal direction which let nothing fall through the cracks. The claw marks will likely remain upon the seat I occupied for quite some time as I felt like I was holding on for dear life for the entire movie. Intense, engrossing, visually impressive and persistently memorable. This is the reason we go to the movies! Do not miss this one and if you can see it IMAX-3D, it's well worth the pennies!",8,5,8,4 October 2013
World War Z," Well executed but anti-climatic
",World War Z starts out with a bang. Barely after introducing the main characters you are caught up in their frantic efforts to escape and survive. The movie does an excellent job of making you care about the characters and their plights and drawing you in to the story and action as a result. The pacing is excellent as the story unfolds in an interesting way.My only complaint is that movie is over quite suddenly and feels very anti-climatic. This is not the ending I expected or even wanted for this film. Although the destination may have been disappointing the journey surely was not so I can genuinely recommend this film.,7,0,7,22 June 2013
Thor: Ragnarok," Tries too Hard but it's Still Fun
","There's a lot to like about Thor Ragnarok. Naturally, everyone's talking about the heavy dose of comedic elements, but I found that 80% of the jokes felt forced and unfunny, and 10% were misplaced. However, there were few groaners or eye-rollers so it was OK. I did like the tone of the movie, though, and Chris Hemsworth's comedy chops are quite impressive. It was nice to see him work with such diverse material. The plot wasn't great, but it was good enough.My favorite parts of this movie were the interactions between Thor and Loki. That's such an interesting relationship and I'm glad they gave it some screen time here. Characters like Loki I find very interesting, that is, anti-heroes with complex motivations.Everything else was pretty good, not super great, but good enough. I can recommend it.",7,11,18,6 November 2017
Pacific Rim," All Style No Substance
",The Good: Some of the best special effects in recent memory. CGI effects are beautiful and seamlessly integrated with actual footage. Fight scenes are satisfying. The scale of the battles felt authentic.The Bad: Very thin plot elements. Characters are shallow and not developed well (despite the screenwriters obvious efforts). Nothing to make you care about the battles or their outcomes.Conclusion: This movie looks great but is easily forgettable. There is nothing of substance to make you really care about this film. It's worth seeing on the big screen but I would recommend the matinée price if available.,6,2,8,22 July 2013
Oblivion," Intellectually Stimulating But Emotionally Vacant
",The Good: Great slow burn plot starts simply and becomes thicker and thicker in a well paced fashion. It keeps your interest throughout the entire movie.The Bad: The movie never engages the audience on an emotional level. The character's actions help drive the plot but you never really feel a connection with them or a reason to root for them. The action sequences are visually exciting but lack suspense.Conclusion: An above average sci-fi movie that pleases on a lot of levels but fails to connect with the audience in ways that could have made it a memorable masterpiece.,7,1,3,20 April 2013
Man of Steel," Started out promising but then crashed and burned
","Superman has always been my favorite superhero but I was disappointed by this film. Basically, the first 40 minutes are very watchable. The flashbacks of young Clark Kent struggling with being different and not knowing how he fits in to the world are interesting. But as soon as Zod and company show up it devolves into a mindless slug fest for the next hour. Character development and storytelling are completely abandoned in favor of explosions and gunfire. By the time the anti-climatic fight between Zod and Superman occurs I'm totally disengaged from this film and thinking about how I can beat the other movie goers to the parking lot. Too bad! :(",4,3,8,17 June 2013
The Lego Movie," Above Average, But Not Fantastic
","When I saw this got 100% on Rottentomatoes.com I was flabbergasted. NOTHING gets 100% on Rottentomates! Boy was I surprised to discover it's just a slightly above average animated film. Not bad, but not great, either. The jokes are chuckle worthy, the characters are somewhat interesting, but ultimately forgettable, the story is entertaining but not overly engaging. I'd say it was worth the price of admission, but it's not a film that could garner repeat viewings from me.Guess all the Rottentomatoes critics are just die hard Lego fans, or something.",7,5,12,8 February 2014
Now You See Me," Watchable but lacks depth & substance
","This is one of those movies that is somewhat entertaining upon first viewing but is easily forgettable and has nothing of substance to make a second viewing possible to enjoy. The plot is convoluted as we don't know what the main characters are doing or why. In fact, everything we know about the 4 magicians is revealed in the first 10 minutes of the movie and after that there is ZERO character development! The entire movie appears to have been made solely for the sake of the ending and yet it was so cliché that I was actually a little angry about the way they did it. It's unfortunate that in the filmmaker's attempts to be clever they neglected the most fundamental elements of storytelling: plot and character.Like a magic show without magic, you may find yourself somewhat entertained but inevitably wind up disappointed in the end because they left out the most important part of the show.",6,668,1005,7 June 2013
Captain America: Civil War," Great Fights, Boring Movie
","I'm a big fan of traditional storytelling. What I mean is, the plot should start off with an inciting incident which introduces the conflict that sets the story in action. The plot should build on this conflict until it is resolved in the climax.But I felt like this movie was all over the place.The climax is a confrontation between Steve and Tony (not a spoiler, it was shown in the trailers), which could have been great if the rest of the movie built up to that. But the inciting incident started a plot about collateral damage, political will, government oversight, and the responsibility of super heroes.Even these themes were not developed very well, imo, as we jumped from random location to random location, the script writers seemingly caring more about groping for reasons to make these heroes fight than putting together any compelling narrative. Then, in the end, the conflict isn't even addressed or resolved. The climax is basically an unrelated (to the plot) fight scene introduced by a random video.I found it to be a messy movie and I was thoroughly disappointed.",5,9,20,6 May 2016
Wreck-It Ralph," Wreck-It Ralph isn't just a home run, it's a grand slam!
","As a 30-something father of two I can say that I absolutely loved this movie. This is really what you hope every movie experience will be like when you go to the theater. The homage to my favorite form of media and entertainment, classic video games, was just the frosting on the cake as this movie had real substance. The plot was wonderful, as it contained all the right elements of surprise, anticipation and suspense. The characters were delightful and the movie really drew you in to their plights and made you care about them and their relationships to one another. I haven't seen a movie this well made, animated or not, in a long time (excluding Avengers). This is one I'll be able to watch over and over again and enjoy each time.",10,3,4,5 November 2012
Avengers: Infinity War," Fun Movie Despite Repetitive Plot
","I really enjoyed this film. It's biggest weakness was its repetitive plot, but its character interactions were pure joy and the way Thanos was developed as a character was a delight.PROS:Great character interactions. Seeing these heroes from diverse properties finally meet and interact in such interesting ways was really satisfying.Well developed bad guy. Thanos is interesting and compelling as an antagonist with understandable motivations.Genuinely funny and organic humor. The jokes were not forced and were often derived from character development, not one-liners. I laughed out loud on several occasions.CONS:Repetitive main plot. Instead of building and thickening throughout the film, the plot was a series of redundant scenes where Thanos tries to get a stone and the heroes try to stop him.Less engaging action sequences. There were a few good fight scenes, but some, like the 'climactic' battle in Wakanda, were a bit underwhelming.",8,4,11,1 May 2018
Frozen," 30 Something Father of Two LOVES This Movie
","I can't explain exactly why I adore this movie so much, but my kids (ages 7 & 8)and I have seen it 4 times over the course of its first two weekends. I guess its the likable characters, the fantastic music and singing, and the beautiful story of family and friendship. But I guess I can also relate to the theme of isolation and loneliness and the plight of Elsa's character. My daughter and I get choked up every time she breaks out in 'Let it Go,' one of the most beautiful songs ever written. EVER.This is just an absolutely beautiful and brilliant film that tickles your emotions and captivates your imagination. This will no doubt go down as one of the greatest Disney classics of all time and I can't wait to own it on DVD.",10,18,40,9 December 2013
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Long & Boring
","This movie wanders aimlessly for the first 45 minutes or so before anything happens. When the plot finally gets started it ends rather abruptly and then starts going in a different direction. It does this yet again and then seems to be over but keeps showing more scenes so that I asked my companion 'why is this movie not over?' I had no idea what the point was or why things were still happening.The plot was paper thin. Find the lost negative. It never thickened or got any more complex then that. Ever. There really was no developed storyline. After about the seventh 'zoned out' episode that Walter Mitty had I became very disinterested in these sideshows and just wanted them to get on with the story. If I was alone I would have walked out I was so bored, but I was with friends and family so I stayed for the whole movie.I cannot recommend this movie to anyone.",3,56,129,25 December 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Muddled Plot and Awkward Dialogue
","First, let me just say that the first 20 minutes of this film are fantastic. We finally get to see the Spider-Man from the comics that not one single movie of either trilogy has shown. I loved that. Then the film went South in a hurry.The next hour is spent introducing characters, and not in a very convincing way, I might add. Why so much time spent on introductions? Because this movie has more plot lines than spider web has geometric shapes. The plot is so muddled with so many different things and there is nothing tying them all together. There is no central theme, nothing for me as the viewer to grasp on to to carry me from one end of the film to the other. It's really a mess.The other thing that turned me off was the awkward dialogue. It was poorly introduced and unconvincingly written. For example, there is absolutely no time spent developing the relationship between Peter Parker and Aunt May, but all of a sudden in the middle of the film there's this big emotional breakthrough which is meaningless because it hasn't been set up properly. And many of the exchanges had me putting my face in my hands and groaning.What's the one redeeming quality of the film? The web slinging. It was the best of any Spider-Man film to date.",5,12,25,4 May 2014
Ex Machina," Fantastically Engaging From Beginning to End
","I watched this on VidAngel recently, and was astounded at how much I enjoyed this film. There were really only three actors and just a few locations, minimalism at its finest. In fact, this could have been made for the stage as well as it was made for the screen. At any rate, from the very first scene to the rolling of the credits I was completely intrigued.The plot, too be sure, progressed wonderfully. The pacing is excellent and the mystery held my interest throughout, with a satisfying twist at the end. But it's the character interaction that really makes this film shine.The dialogue is superb. Well crafted and realistic it makes the characters and their relationships with one another the centerpiece of this film. The characters are exquisitely defined and the acting top notch, completely drawing me into the story. Nathan and Ava are especially fascinating character studies, and long after the film had ended I found myself thinking about them and the way they were portrayed.This is a true gem of a film, and it makes me sad that it didn't attract the attention it deserves. I hope it makes up for this in its life as a DVD.",10,3,6,17 August 2015
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Shockingly, Surprisingly Good
","First, know that I am a gigantic Star Wars fan but I had no plans to see this movie at the theater. I just knew my heart could not handle another disappointment, and it has been decades of disappointment for me, from the prequels to Episode VII and Rogue One. However, my 11 year old son begged me to take him on opening night. I couldn't be happier that he did.Unlike VII, it does a nice job of developing interesting characters. Whereas Poe was a paper thin fighter pilot, now he's a fledgling leader driven to success despite (or because) of his personality flaws. I disliked Kylo and Rey in VII, but here an interesting relationship is developed between them that I found realistic and compelling. Luke's back story had me emotionally engaged throughout the movie.I would have given this movie a higher score if it weren't for it's many flaws. I thought Flynn's storyline was poorly done and I still don't find him to be an interesting or necessary character. I would have liked to have seen them do more with him than just chasing McGuffins. There's a few small plot holes, too, but I'm willing to forgive them because I enjoyed the movie so much.All things considered, I must admit that I haven't been this excited after watching a movie in a long, long time, and the fact that it's a Star Wars movie couldn't make me happier. It's a shame that Disney has brought Jar Jar Abrams back to do IX, but oh well, at least we got one good episode out of them before they screw things up again.",8,0,10,15 December 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," No one was more disappointed than me
","It hurts to rate this so poorly, but it certainly deserves the low marks. There were so many things that ruined this movie for me.1) The Storytelling - Or lack thereof. There was not a compelling story to be told here. Ultron wants to blow up the world, the Avengers try to stop him. That's all the audience ever really knows about this story and it felt flat and unfulfilling.2) Plot? - The movie opens with our heroes in the middle of a battle for reasons that are largely unimportant. That pretty much sums up this whole film3) The Love Interest - Totally underdeveloped. We're basically told by the script writer that these two people are in love, but never are we SHOWN that they're falling in love. It rang completely hollow.4) The Humor - There were WAY too many jokes in this movie, and that wouldn't have been all that bad if so many of them weren't eye rollers. Many of them left me groaning.5) Ultron - This guy appears out of nowhere and is woefully underdeveloped. Plus, he's supposed to be some kind of AI but he's constantly cracking off stupid one-liners and making facial expressions that I thought were inconsistent with what and who he was supposed to be.6) Character Overload - There were WAY too many characters to do any of them any justice. I would have liked the film to focus on a smaller group of characters and their relationships with one another, instead, we got a who's who of the entire Marvel universe leaving a lot to be desired.I could go on, but my heart is still aching and I don't want to talk about it anymore. I see that a lot of people liked it and I'm happy that they did. I only wish it hadn't been such a colossal disappointment for me.",5,814,1613,1 May 2015
Beauty and the Beast," A Missed Opportunity
","***SPOILERS FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW THE STORY***CASTINGI liked Emma Watson as Belle, she's a fine actress and a good source of eye candy and was well cast in that role.  Belle's father, on the other hand, played by Kevin Kline, was by far the weakest link in the cast.  He was a poor decision to play that part and I don't think his character was written very well either.  The actor who portrayed Gaston was absolutely wonderful, and although I don't care for that character in the animated version, I really enjoyed him in this movie.  However, as much as I like Josh Gad I don't think he was a very good choice to play LaFou.  Along with not being so well written I thought LaFou was kinda cringey in some scenes.PLOTI'm happy to say that the live action movie fixed most, if not all, of the plot issues I hold against the animated feature.  For example, instead of having the beast begin hitting on Belle as soon as he takes her prisoner it is now portrayed as a secret collaboration by the servants to get their master together with Belle, one which the beast initially resists.  This works SOOO much better, imo.  However, many of the scenes are woefully underdeveloped.  The wolf attack scene, for example.  The beast gets a couple of bites and we're supposed to believe he's incapacitated for days?  And the scene where Belle chooses to take the place of her father was not done well.  It's a critical plot point but they seem to rush through it.  Most egregious of these errors, though, is the handling of the climax.  When the last rose petal falls and Belle thinks the beast is dead, we as the audience are caught up in the emotion of it all.  She kneels down next to him and then the camera cuts to show what's going on in the rest of the castle.  By the time they get back to Belle and the fallen beast my emotional investment in the scene had waned considerably.  It's a travesty and a sign of poor direction or scriptwriting or both.CONCLUSIONI did enjoy the film, warts and all, and I like it better than the animated version, however, I think it was a real missed opportunity.  It could have been magnificent in the hands of better filmmakers.",7,1,4,3 May 2017
Edge of Tomorrow," Heavy on Plot, Light on Heart
","THE GOOD: Engaging and interesting plot. Great action scenes. Top notch visual effects. The movie delivers on intensity and excitement.THE BAD: Almost no character development. Really, the main character is not even developed. We know he's an officer who gets shanghai'd into active duty on the front line. We also know he has the power to reset the day when he dies. We never learn anything else about him. Zero, zilch, nada. Equally undeveloped is his 'relationship' with the secondary character played by Emily Blunt. There was some awesome potential for an excellent character there, but all we got was a companion he could run around with completing their missions. There was one brief farmhouse scene where they spent like two minutes trying to show that there was a relationship developing, but it wasn't enough.By the end of the movie I haven't been made to care about these characters, only what happens in the story. That is a HUGE script writing mistake, IMHO. This movie could have been spectacular if it had deep, interesting characters but as it turns out, it was only an above average action flick.",7,2,6,6 June 2014
Murder on the Orient Express," Uninteresting Characters & Dialogue
","I wasn't familiar with this story or the solution to the mystery but I knew it was popular, so imagine my surprise when I found it so uninteresting.None of these characters are compelling in any way. How am I supposed to care about this crime when I'm not made to care about the characters? Also, why should I care if the detective solves it or not, what are the stakes? If he fails, what happens? Nothing. This movie gave me no reason to care about the story or the characters in it.Additionally, the movie was about 90% dialogue, which isn't a problem unless the dialogue is dry and uninteresting, which I thought it was.If you like mysteries for the sake of a mystery perhaps you'll enjoy this one, but I found it rather dull.",5,3,7,30 November 2017
Arrival," Lacking Key Components of Good Storytelling
","I love sci-fi, so when I heard all the hubbub about this movie I was excited to see it.I was disappointed.It's like someone had a clever idea for what should have been a 30 min short film and tried to stretch it out into a 2 hour movie. These characters are never developed. I know nothing about their personal goals or desires, and they don't change at all, they have no arc. They are cardboard stand-ins so that the writer can flesh out their clever plot idea.There's also very little conflict here, and a good plot needs good conflict. So without a good plot or character development, the film felt quite empty.",5,2,9,21 November 2016
Thor: The Dark World," Poor writing and characters
","There are a number of reasons why I found this film to be disappointing, unlike its predecessor which I enjoyed very much.1) Underdeveloped Bad Guy Syndrome: I know almost nothing about the bad guy even after watching the film. A dark elf who wants to blow everything up. Apparently that's all we need to know and all we'll ever know about the main villain in the film.2) Pointless Main Characters: The main characters in this film offer nothing of substance or value. For example, you could have replaced Jane with any other character without affecting the film. She exists solely as plot vehicle. The film does not explore her relationship with Thor, her reaction as a character to being transported to a different world, etc., etc. She's as thin as cardboard, like the rest of the main characters of this film.3) Very Poor Humor: Almost all of the jokes in this film made me roll my eyes and groan. It's as if the script writers liked the humor in Avengers and attempted to duplicate it without any knowledge of how.4) Ridiculous Plot Devices: Things in this movie only happen because the script says they have to. For example, Jane being the one possessed by the dark energy. Or the car keys being discovered on another planet. These things make no sense but exist solely because they have to for the plot to continue. I hate that.I had high hopes for Thor II but in the end it was just another disappointing let down.",5,93,173,30 November 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A Disappointment on Every Level
","This film was a huge disappointment to me. Here's why:1) CHARACTERSRey - An obvious Mary Sue. Mary Sue characters are BORING. There's a reason they are so passionately argued against by lovers of great storytelling.Finn - Paper thin. He has zero depth. Maybe one of the most boring Star Wars main characters of all time.Kylo Ren - A sissy. He was not a compelling villain in any sense of the term. I liked Darth Maul better and he had barely more than 10 mins of screen time in The Phantom Menace.2) STORYCompletely Unoriginal - I felt like they cut and pasted the story elements from the first three films to make this script.3) PLOTWhat's the Plot? - They're trying to find Luke. Honestly, I can't even remember why now. Then they have to destroy another death star. :YAWN:It makes me sad that this film is doing so well at the box office. I hate to see mediocrity so well rewarded.",4,20,28,28 December 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Much better than the original
","The original Hunger Games left me feeling empty and unsatisfied. It lacked depth and substance. I almost skipped Catching Fire because of it but I'm glad I didn't.Catching Fire has several things going for it that the original didn't.1) A Great Bad Guy: Although Donald Sutherland was in the original his character was more of a token villain and the focus was on the rival contestants. In Catching Fire, we have a great bad guy that the audience can love to hate. There's real conflict and tension between Katniss and the President and this serves as a great foundation on which to base the film.2) Excellent Conflict: The root of any drama is conflict and this has a lot of it. I loved the conversation between Katniss and the President in the early part of the film that sets the stage for the rest of the movie. Two opposing forces who hate each other but must tolerate the others' existence while secretly plotting ways to either eliminate or mitigate the threat the other poses. A cunning game of cat and mouse ensues as they engage in a battle of wits.3) Interesting Characters: The relationship between Katniss and Peeta is complicated and interesting to watch as it develops on screen. Haymitch, the most interesting character from the original, continues to be entertaining. There are a lot of undeveloped characters in this film that I would have liked to have known more about (for example, Nuts and Bolts) but I am satisfied with the level of character development in this film.4) Emotional Appeal: Although the actual hunger games portion of the movie is devoid of emotion, much like its predecessor, the rest of the film manages to engage your feelings. Katniss & Peeta's visit to the other districts to pay respect to the fallen tributes was interesting. Katniss' insistence on Peeta's protection and survival was believable. Her emotional breakdown in the end was quite stirring. I was surprised the film was able to achieve this connection with the audience.All in all, this is one of those rare instances where the sequel is better than the original. That doesn't happen very often.",7,7,25,30 November 2013
Godzilla," Bored From Beginning to End...Actually Bored!
","This movie failed to make me care about anything that was happening to the people or the monsters. I was actually bored the entire movie. It started during the opening sequence where the nuclear plant was malfunctioning. I suppose it was suppose to be emotional and suspenseful as the main character tried to save his wife, but for some reason the movie just didn't make me care. With the other main characters we get a 2-minute scene of dad coming home from active duty. The entire character development of the whole movie is based on that one 2-minute scene as if that's all we need to care about these people. It wasn't enough. And when you don't care about the people in the movie, you don't care about the movie. I have never been BORED while watching a disaster film, even if it was bad, but I was bored out of my mind on this one. I can't recommend it to anyone.",3,7,15,16 May 2014
