Ford v Ferrari," What a ride!
",Great cast. Great direction. Great dramatic storyline.,10,3,6,2 December 2019
Bird Box," Honored the book with some + and - es
","I've Been a fan of horror since 1986. I've read 30 odd Stephen King books along with many other great writers in the genre. The story is original and honestly is best represented by the book by far.However, if you watch the movie first... It is well done. What it does well is tell the story honestly and fairly suspense-fully. What it lacks is the dynamic and tension in the house between the characters, the climax in its full glory , and the drama of the mom's reliance on the children's special abilities to hear on the river all threats. If anything, it should inspire you to read the story! Music and sound should have been better utilized ( they are blindfolded In most of the movie!). Overall though... it was a good B.",8,0,4,8 April 2020
