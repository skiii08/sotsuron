Hereditary," Rotten smell in room at the end of movie
","At the end of the movie, we could smell something rotten in our room. All of you reading this review will ask, oh is the movie that cynical? Is it that horrifying? All these ppl have given a 10. Well! the smell is of the POOP that the director Ari Aster dumped for us. The movie is sooooooo bad and is laughably stupid. It builds upon a very childish concept and throws random horror scenes. The genre should be gross instead of horror. Please people, stop being stupid! We can have good horrors like the Ring",1,1,6,21 April 2019
