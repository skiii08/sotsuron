Blade Runner 2049," A Well made, visually stunning return to the Blade Runner universe
","Following on from the original was always going to be difficult, but I think 2049 pulls it off in a way that is satisfying to old-time fans, and people watching without having seen the original. The film retains the atmosphere of its predecessor, partly due to the magnificent score of Hans Zimmer, partly due to the excellent visuals and overall theme of hope. Jared Leto was mesmerizing as the villain(?) Niander Wallace, who is trying to create replicants who are happily subservient it's a shame he didn't get more screen time. Ryan Gosling proves he is a capable actor outside of rom-coms by carrying the film as K, and Harrison Ford, while old, still retains his old acting charm.+Jared Leto +The atmosphere +Excellent CGI, especially recreating Sean Young +Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford's scenes-Could have been half an hour shorter -Spends too much time with K's holographic girlfriend -A few plot holes when you take time to think about itOverall, Blade Runner 2049 is an excellent sci fi film, one of the best of the year",7,0,3,11 October 2017
