The Ring," Nothing can top this movie, it has everything.
","I consider myself a horror, thriller, slasher film freak, and don't scare easly, and this movie did it for me.  This movie had everything a person like me can ever ask for in a movie: scare factor, gore, thought, camera angles, colors, good plot/story line was interesting, etc...  By far became an instant classic for me and one of my favorites.  A movie I will own when it is for sale.  Don't see this movie alone.",10,0,0,24 October 2002
