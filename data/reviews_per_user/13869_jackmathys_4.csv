United 93," 93 is the % chance that NO calls were possible...
","The so-called heroes chatting with spouses on iPhones from heights where phone service is not available, and then screaming the famous bonsai of 9/11, 'let's roll,' have served to create the urban legend of 9/11.
Evidence of a plane crash isn't even there, and the site was quickly and illegally controlled by the FBLie.
As the representation of a legal fiction, the film was poorly done and badly acted.",2,1,6,16 September 2018
Crash," Cheadle is a great actor!
","A favorite of mine, I especially enjoyed the performances of Cheadle, Ludicrous, and Dillon.",9,0,1,16 September 2018
Psycho," Janet Leigh, Amateurish!
","Re-watching this great film, it seems like Janet should have been wearing a big 'Yes, I'm a crook!' Sign. All those mistakes, I suppose, increased the dramatic tension in her character, but to me it's a tad bit unbelievable.",9,0,2,3 October 2018
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," One star-for the opening credits!
","America, do we really have nothing better to do? This sad and pathetic aesthetic sin of a film, which I viewed in fits and starts working my tax books while babysitting my little boy, provides ample proof of the dumbing down of our anti-intellectual society, and to such an extent as to make one weep.
Will Ferrel is just a guy with no shame. He's not funny. He comes from the new breed of comic, whose product is based on prehistoric facial mugging and mooning, body language and Schtick of a purely physical nature. Tina what's her name, for example, has one claim to fame, and it's that permanent smirk you see in every photo.
This pre-semiotic communication cum art used to be the sole property of the classic and disturbingly embarrassing 'nitwit.' You'll note Will and Tina don't do stand-up; my guess is that they are simply incapable of being funny standing still.",1,2,3,6 December 2018
