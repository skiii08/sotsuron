The Lobster," Warped but Good
","This film is severely warped. I like it. The peacocks have symbolism, but I am not complete on that. It is s story of enduring love with an obscure, odd plot to represent it. Objectification of M-F relationships is the backdrop. Some odd future....where people are morphed to animals. The characters are childlike, so is the representation of love. However, the odd nature of the world created and the odd nature of this couples love will capture your imagination, if you are the type or patient enough to watch it. 10 for plot and story, -2 for the naivete, with no add or subtract for the wonderful characterizations. The farther it goes, the odder the plot warps.",8,0,2,18 August 2016
A Star Is Born," Horrid
","OMG, what a horrid misery of a film. For women who put up with a horrid male partner, its probably a wondeful representation. For normal human beings its an observation of privalage and horrid waste. Why do I want to see a rich person waste their life because of supposed early life unhappiness or whatever? F this. F the folks who make and support this. You are weak and worthless. I grew up in a sh_t home, horrid parent for whatever reason and i have over come their weakness. F folks like those shown inthe film. Know when to say f u to a bad partner. I film in support of weak individuals who stay in abusive relationships. I hated this and hate the folks who promote this as inspirational. its horrid.",1,4,7,27 April 2019
Lion," Great Story
","What a great story. I recommend this film! Heart warming, sad, so much there. Most folks probably soul search at some point. This is the ride of a person going through that. However, the history is such that it is a story we all want to see. Where do I come from? All that. But there is a lot too his story. Really amazing.",9,0,0,26 July 2017
Nightcrawler," Slimy, Slimy, Slimy
","This film deserves a much higher numeric rating than I gave it, but it is just so slimy, I can't give it higher.The film is about the lowlife nature of TV news. How low they'll go to get a story. My view is really not changed by this for TV news because the way they warp public concern about weather events, create panic, create public unease purposely for ratings already makes me sick. The film shows that they go even lower than my opinion of them now. Jake G is now at his best level of acting skills I've seen. The awfulness of his character is disturbing. Pay attention to how much he pays his employee and all that unfolds with that character, since its a jaw dropper.I thought about how I would feel if I was one of the victims in the film and it turns my stomach. Jake G is the film.",7,0,1,7 March 2015
Oblivion," Good Sci Fi Flick
","This is a great sci fi flick. The plot unravels slowly, a marker of a good film. I think I figured a lot out after 30-40 min and probably a lot do, but I think people want that in a film, even if they say they don't. Excellent put together on this though. Good effects, compelling story, good soundtrack (M83), and overall ownership of the product by Kosinski.I wish I had seen this at theaters. My only criticism is that the plot is a bit thin as far as details go....or rather, not as believable but that is Sci Fi anyhow, right? Honestly, I think a lot of the ideas, colors, and theme mimic star wars movies a bit though it is not a star wars clone at all. If you look at the 'bad guys' the black and white color and flight abilities are like star wars. I guess it is hard for sci fi flicks to define themselves quite separately. I think it also borrows from movies like Memento.",9,3,5,25 August 2013
The Revenant," Good Remake
","Ever since I saw the previews, I have been trying to place this plot, story with one of the more shocking films I saw as a kid. Man in the Wilderness. This is kind of a remake of that film and for me it impacts my impression of this film. I can still remember Richard Harris' performance which left an impression with me. I think it still impacts how I feel about being out in the woods. John Huston's performance also comes back right away. Well after plugging this old version, now to this film. It is very good. It all appears believable when you are watching it, but it is so much a crazy miracle for that to have happened. I remember the change of seasons in the old one......this one not so much. So the distance and the period of time in the Revenant is different than for Man in the Wilderness. He doesn't appear to have been as far away from the fort as portrayed. I read about the actors putting up with difficult conditions making the film. I can believe that. The attack is very believable. The persistence of his comrades to help him surprises me in this film. I thought life was cheap back then and the others in the party questioning their potential demise would have been enough to abandon this man.If you have spent any time in the woods, in the winter, you'd know that the conditions are deadly. We hunt in freezing conditions in November and without all of my supplies, water, food and warming up each day that'd do me in in a day or two. Really, getting wet and being in that cold one time would probably do a person in and it happens to this fellow numerous times. I kept thinking he'd lose a foot fingers, etc, but he didn't.So, after a long, boring rambling review, I'd say I like this film, but too much unbelievable things in it for me.",8,0,4,10 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," Makes You Proud to be an American
","Hanks just chooses the best or he is the best, not sure. This film inspires. I mean you feel for the bad guy by the end of it. Hanks makes it innately human and American. He somehow always instills a sense of pride with his films where he plays a character like this. Honestly, I enjoyed the settings and costumery quite a bit. They really did a great job placing us in the time. I liked the scenes around the wall. It makes me wonder if that is how it was, just walk across the area as they built it. I have been to the museum at Brandenburger Tor. I didn't get some of the things shown in this film from that visit. Though a lot was shown.",9,0,3,18 March 2016
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Grand Budapest, Fun Film
","Grand Budapest is really a fun film. Fiennes is at his peak! The movie is funny, interesting. The cinematography is great and pops off the screen.I like the plot, way its told and the setting. Some of my favorite actors are in this and the newer actors are great too. The timeline jumps and the hops in the plot are just right, enhancing the story. I don't know if this is an award winning movie, but very, very well done and the type that doesn't ask for too much investment from you but entertains well.",8,2,4,7 March 2015
Gone Girl," LIke the film, but it is a frustration film
","I like this film, but it uses the simple tactic of unraveling the story to the viewer, while unknown to the characters in the film.You have a sense of angst and frustration watching it. It is very interesting and the plot swings make you think.The brashness of it is disturbing.The acting is pretty good, but Rosamund Pike gets the best of it. She is in so many roles kinda like this or similar to this. At least what I have seen of her. I am starting to frame her as this type of character. She is becoming one of the great villains of film to me.In the end this film really makes you think of what you are willing to accept.",8,0,3,7 March 2015
Room," Horrible
","Couldn't get past the first 40 min of depressing material. This is just too much for me. Why is the story of a captive and her child interesting? It is not. Shows the detailed life of a captive person. I am sure there is something uplifting at some point but I am just not interested. This is current, has happened, etc. I just don't need to watch the detail of it including the emotional pain etc. This is not a story that needs to be told it is a story that we need to prevent in the real world. It is not entertaining, just exceptionally depressing. The possibility of harm to the child by the captor is in no way exciting or interesting to me. I could also watch a day in the life of a prisoner who is raped in the cell but why? Is that somehow interesting? Not to me.",1,33,94,18 March 2016
Ex Machina," Plot Twists
","Maybe I rated this low. The big plot twist is the most interesting. The story, most of it unless you fall for Ms Vikander is not too exciting. I think this has been told in other ways. My biggest question watching it is how he gets the mods to the bots out there where he has to receive everything by helicopter and a walk through the woods..... I mean upgrades in hardware and technology of all those bots.... Software and such sure, no problem, but the hardware. Of course, sex has to get involved and sling it into the gutter a bit.... I watched it but it drags at some point. Story told many times. I think maybe the 60's Star Trek series told several flavors of this tale.",6,3,6,18 March 2016
Lincoln," Lincoln, a good story for folks to know today. The best!
","I enjoyed the character representations in this film. Of course, Daniel Lewis is just the best. However, Spader really caught my attention too. A fun part to play but he does it so well. The movie covers areas I hadn't thought about and I didn't realize the film would cover things in this way. Surprising, but excellent. I have read and heard rumors about Mary Lincoln but I liked the portrayal of her and all the detail. I think that this is a movie the family can watch, though our kids didn't go. It made us want to research the characters in the film. Thaddeus Stevens and Lydia Smith were two I had to check into after the movie. I don't usually go for Tommy Lee Jones in movies, but he was pretty good in this one. Even characters like Grant were very well done. I hope Lincoln was the man portrayed in this movie. Its a film that makes you proud to be an American.",10,3,8,8 December 2012
Sicario," Attention Getter
","OK this action, thriller kept me going and very interested. As the lead delves into the mired plot so do we, the audience. It is well done as an exploratory thriller. The shocks along the way they expose you to keep you interested. The breach of what appears to be right or wrong. If you are not able to handle graphic violence this film is not for you. I dunno about Ms Blunt and her constant plunge into action flicks. I guess it is believable and I bought it for this film. The outsider feeling is also something that kept my interest from her perspective. I have been some of the places in the film and did not realize the danger, so that was the biggest eye opener to me.",8,1,2,18 March 2016
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Not My Thing
","This movie is for critics, film industry folks, folks who romanticize the profession of acting in my opinion. While the cinematography is cool, some actor performances are strong, the film plot was ever so thin. The struggle of an actor with his ego? The artsy interludes of introspection with visual effects? It is really self involved and cheesy for folks in the film/acting industry to try to highlight the troubles of being a star. I mean are you kidding? Acting and fame are so hard? What? The story of introspection of an actor is really just......like a film crew was sitting around bored and said '...lets make a film about ourselves!'. Granted, a very talented film crew and actors.I see the stories told by film in a different light. Maybe I am just a fan of a movie like the made up 'Birdman' they talk about in the Birdman movie. I want a plot that interests me about something. For example, I had just seen Snow Falling on the Cedars (again) prior to checking out Birdman. There is no comparison. Both films cover human introspection and a story....but SFOTC is a story that touches folks and Birdman.....doesn't for me, not even close. I felt nothing seeing Birdman, but SFOTC immersed me in feelings about the plot, the story, and so the characters.I watched the Acadamy awards recently, don't always. The fact that Birdman won so many awards reminds me that the decisions of the Acadamy don't reflect the public's choice for the best films. The Acadamy's choices truly reflect the film industry's choice for best films, based on film industry folk's interests. Clearly they were interested about a film that highlights acting/entertainment topics that are important to them. Now it makes sense to me.",6,2,5,7 March 2015
The Big Short," Good for Understanding
","OK, this bored me to tears. Did folks not know the crash was due to companies 'propping' the market? Anybody buy a house and offered twice as much as they wanted? I was. I told them I live within my means and bought a home accordingly. It is the story of 3 levels of folks who figure out the market early,later, and latest from my view. Not interesting. How did they do this? I read the news and know how they did this, the mortgage folks that is. A lot of over characterizations based on one person representation such as the scenes about the rating agency. This is a film for those not clueful about this and those who are woefully uninformed. I was bored. I did not find Bael's performance was interesting or enlightening in any way. Why is a geek investor noting the numbers interesting?",4,0,1,18 March 2016
Win Win," Heart Winner
",This film will win your heart. The kid is somehow great coming from a bad background. That gets you vested. Not the case from what I have seen though. Small town life seems right to me how they portray it. The turn on events with the leads behavior is what makes the story. Giamatti is just the best at whatever film he does. We watched this with our teenager and she liked it too. I never liked wrestling to watch or to take part. This film has a very good spin on it. Some of the story is hard to believe such as a good lawyer who just can't get work..... I'd recommend this film for the whole family! Not a lot more to say without giving away the story.,8,1,1,18 March 2016
Life," Thriller, Horror
","This thing is just a horror movie and not that well done. There is no mystery here, nothing of that sort. I find this to be disturbing and quite frankly, just not necessary. I was trying to compare this to horror movies I've seen that are sci fi, scary, good. Nothing really comes to mind. I don't recommend this one.",5,0,5,26 July 2017
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Very Good, Old Tech, Not Held to Spy Movie Stereotypes...Mostly
","I really liked this film. It was a mix of the Avengers and James Bond. Not quite as slick all the way through as a James Bond flick but that's what gave it a distinguishing feel. A lot of old-new tech all the way through. A lot of new-new tech as in spy flicks as always too. I liked that. It is the story of an underdog. Also,I have never seen S Jackson in a role like this film. Pretty good. Colin Firth is great. Some of the cheeky humor goes overboard. Quite a lot of lines they use to make fun of other spy film phrases, actions, etc.However,the not so smooth feel of it makes it more interesting, I think. James Bond is not fallible, these folks are. I would have rated it higher,but if felt like so much of the story is missing....maybe on the cutting room floor? I think they needed a bit more to immerse me in the training portion and other sections of the film.",8,1,7,5 April 2015
Spectre," I agree, Must See
","I liked this film. I have not seen a bad bond film. This is not my favorite of the Craig, Bond films. It is good. There were less exciting sequences in this one and more predictable outcomes. The culmination sequence at the end was just not as techno-exciting as other Bond films. I mean, the desert complex scene was the least believable I have seen in a Bond film. It did not take much for that outcome. The end scene didn't take the over the top type of Bond techno-phycical- extreme type of activity I'd expect out of a James Bond flick. It seemed like James Bond light. The costar was just great and one of the best Bond girls ever. Christoph Waltz is really one of my favorite actors now. His performance too seemed like a ho hum repeat of roles in other films. He is a master of the glib, matter of fact delivery, but I have seen this nearly similar performance in his other recent films, nothing new.... He is just so much better than asked of him in this film. The ending where we are shown if Craig will/will not do another Bond film, in my opinion, was also rather drawn out and didn't pique my interest. I like Bond films, I liked this one, just not the strongest one I have seen. I found myself wondering about the next Bond film at the end of this one and how it will compare.",7,1,3,22 November 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Wow, How?
","This film truly captured the spirit of the first Mad Max to me. But with Charlize Theron, perfume commercial lady, being the tough guy, it is just amazing. I mean, Hardy is the guy, the tough guy, but I think she is shown to be tougher, odd! I liked this. It was really good. Too much violence for violence sake as in all Mad Max films, but still awesome. The story line kept my interest. Lots of the crazy in it too. Hardy is almost too silent and not enough content from him. Theron is the enduring hero though....wholly crap! I guess she has done roles like this though. The fire spitting vehicles, crazy ruler, tribal followers, are all Mad Max to the max.",8,2,5,22 November 2015
13 Hours," True Story, The Details Tell It
","Well I did not rate this too high based on the acting, cinematography, and how the director unraveled the story.It is a 10 out of 10 for informing me on what happened at Bengazi. I did not know all of this. I have read a lot about how the state department did or did not do things correctly, but watching this it is squarely a failure of the military to support these folks. It occurred over a really long period of time and help was hours away. They should have gotten help. I understand that the State Department/Congress did not fund the embassies around the world enough. However, the CIA local directors self preservation and the failure of the military in that part of the world to support them also shocked me. The most shocking to me is the ambassador was delivered alive by Libyans to a Libyan hospital. What the hell!If they ever find out that the state department ordered there to be no support or something, I would support the anger toward them but I don't think that is what happened.The film shows that for whatever reason, confusion, misinformation, etc, the folks in Bengazi did not get the rapid, real, support they could have gotten. It is painful to watch. The state department was not in charge of a tactical circumstance like this. The military is in charge, period, unless somehow limited. The detail about the accurate mortars, the preplanning and all is interesting, very much so, but really not part of any unraveling conspiracy in my opinion. They wanted to kill us Americans there. That is it. I am glad there was some support from the locals as it did hurt us, but also helped it appeared. Fighting a war where your allies are your enemies at times is the craziest part! I have been to many, many US hellholes around the world in the Navy and I feel very lucky that during my military service I was not laid out without support like these folks. We in the US are so insulated from the real world where folks will kill you for your citizenship, a price on your head, well for many things that wouldn't seem worth it. I still cannot bear to watch our culture move toward 'Idiocracy' when I see 3rd world cultures whose basic culture and mode of operation are that of how it was in the US 30-50 years ago. I guess I am just getting old. I am always glad to come home now from work travel abroad and that has not changed anytime in my life. I am a proud American. I see the immanent decline coming, though. If you want to know what will happen here, look at culture in Western Europe as our decline will mimic theirs though lag by years at a time.",7,2,6,18 June 2016
The Martian," Spirit of Can Do
","That is the best part of this film, the spirit of can do. It is the spirit of Apollo. He is constantly confronted with the impossible, but he works his way through it. Really, something inspiring to everyone, well to me anyhow. He's a biologist, but works through many types of problems outside of his expertise by a logical approach. Aside from being just interesting, it is a thriller of sorts and the ending culmination leaves you in amazement, well me anyhow! The spirit of the film is so optimistic and so much what is missing in the US culture today that it is refreshing to watch. He doesn't use a cell phone to call someone to take care of his emergencies and accept that he can't do it..... It highlights the spirit of self accomplishment and shows teamwork too, amazing.",9,2,6,22 November 2015
