Catch Me If You Can," Really entertaining!
","This is a typical Hollywood entertaining movie!  I couldn't help crying 'genius' as I watched the movie.  Yes, they produce the movie to fulfill dreams of people that can never be realized in real life. Of course the story can't be totally true: the plot that Frank escaped airplane by screwing off a few screws, truely interesting, but later with careful thinking, a normal human being can't just screw that off from top advanced instruments such as airplanes. Despite that, it's a wonderful Hollywood dream!",9,1,2,15 April 2003
Memento," Freaky editing
","With a man wearing freaky tattoos, this is a movie of freaky editing.  For a moment, I told myself that I liked this editing.  But later on, I realized the key to good editing.  Only ones help telling a logic story can win 'Best Editing' awards.  I don't think this movie has a good logical editing.",Null,1,2,29 September 2003
Finding Nemo," Only Disney!
","Yes, It's only Disney who is able to make such a cartoon movie a splendid, magnificent, and charming one! Heard that the little son of my wife's colleague was scared and later delighted by the plot. Though being an adult, I was not so moved by the story, but I'm still attracted deeply.  My wife said I was so dedicated into watching the movie. I love this one, really.  Comparable with 'Lion King', as a sentimental cartoon.",9,0,1,18 August 2003
Chicken Run," not only for kids
","There's a lot of fun in it, one thing is that the 'human beings' in this animation picture, all look like chickens! Only Americans can make animation movies so maturely a motion picture. Not at all a movie to teas the kids, except that the funny figures can attract them a lot.  But the chicken's crying of 'freedom' make you think what?  'Brave Heart' for me.  This is an eternal slogan for all, admit it or not.",9,1,2,20 October 2001
Chicken Run," Chicken-face
","It's really fun!  Not only the chickens themselves, but human beings in this animation picture, looks like the animated chickens!  With their noses to be the counterpart for chickens beaks. But anyway, there is still the eternal slogan in American movies, also their national motto: 'Freedom'.  Like that in 'Brave Heart'.",9,1,2,20 October 2001
The Day After Tomorrow," A good apocalypse to all human beings
","Especially American! As said by the 'U.S. President' in the movie, we have deprived too much from the earth.  We get revenge! Please do something to stop this extravagant deprivation from the nature. Another interesting thing of the movie is that Americans become refugees into Mexico and other Latin American nations.  But this was solved too simply by an exemption of national debts announced by the 'President'.  But saying them to be so generous could be true.  They could add a condition: no US governmental officials should cross the border!  But this might make the plot too lengthy. Hmm... I said back in 1996, maybe.  That disaster movies are resurrecting these days.  Noticed the name of Rolland Emmerich, who was the director for 'Godzilla', 'Independence Day', and a set of disastrous movies!",6,0,0,29 May 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," clones unclear...
","It conforms well with the Star Wars series, by those specific 'terms' like 'May Force be with you', 'the dark side(of the Force)', etc.  And visual-effect faults are less than the older episodes. But flaws are still obvious, in the structure of the story, though.  It is called 'Attack of Clones', but the clones are not described clearly. Another interesting thing is that I can find origins of most of the scenes, mostly American scenes.",6,0,0,16 July 2002
American Pie," adolescents
","I don't like adolescence movies very much.  And there are so many disgusting scenes in it. But still, the way they are thinking is still nice.  And the American parents are fun. And, the final part is kinda interesting, how they are gonna say 'goodbye' to the high school lives.",5,0,1,20 July 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," ugly vs. beautiful
","Though the story, the visual effect is cool, I think there're too few beautiful impressions, only that sweet fairy lady.  The whole movie is full of ugly monsters, terrible scenes... I don't like that. I think it should give more scenes to the beautiful things, more stories told about the fairy lady, or something.",6,0,0,3 February 2002
Cold Mountain," Symphonous scene is marvelous
","I remember a scene with soldiers fighting, and the background music is a symphony. I can't recognize what music that is, but really sounds powerful.Another thing that caught my attention is the accent of W. P. Inman.Have I ever met the cast in the movie? Maybe I have dreamed of them once! Or, have they phoned me?I have impression that they phoned me, but I don't have the calling record on my cellphone. Due to my flamboyant disarray of dreams lately, I can't be sure whether this impression is real memory. Upon this problem, only 'detale' can provide answers. But I'm still not sure, maybe it's all dreams 'implanted' by my teacher.",8,3,5,29 March 2005
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," visually, no greater than former 2 parts
","The TX machine is just a combination of T101 and T1000.  Sometimes it will just shine like a T1000. I prefer the final words John telling the audience, but it's too short, and can't make this movie great by merely a few words. Generally speaking, visually, it's no greater than the former 2 parts.",6,0,0,18 August 2003
Spider-Man," Comparable to 'Lord of the Rings'
","I used to enjoy this type: mystery+SF, but I don't any more.  This movie is not bad as a SciFiction, very cute imagination, and complete one.  But the story, I didn't finish the whole thing, is not very charming.  Just like 'Lord of the Rings', nothing is beautiful in the scenes!  Well, maybe it's better according to my taste: for its SF part, it's certainly better than 'Lord of the Rings', which only contains mystery, but no science.",Null,0,0,19 May 2002
The Game," original, but not touching
","The plot is interesting, original, and cool.  But actually, I don't feel anything emotionally touching me.  Only through rational thinking, I can feel the serious meanings in the plot.  It is people's careless thinking, that take other's lives as games.  But think about it more carefully, isn't it a fable that tells people the reality?  To think about the reality from another point of view.  The reality is indeed like a game, only in real life, the games don't run this way, maybe not this fierce.  And it's definitely possible in the US.",6,1,2,2 December 2001
National Treasure," Watch the unfolding story...
","Now, the movies are getting more and more from computer games. This one is not so much from action games, but rather from RPG(roll playing game) games.You see that, he works hard to get an answer, and it is just a clue for the second answer. As he worked on and on, the plot unfolds more and more.I don't think the plot is so great to intrigue my deepest emotions, but hey, the unfolding plot makes the story quite intriguing already!My rating is based on my own feeling towards the movie. For those really touching my soul, they got higher scores.",7,1,1,22 March 2005
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Good visual effect, and lovely Emma Watson
","A good second-class movie!  I mean, the story is not really perfect.  But visual effect is good, and I like the girl Hermione(performed by Emma Watson), I should remember this name, and see her future performances!",7,0,0,9 December 2001
Enemy at the Gates," Cool
","The coolest part is that the guy helped to reflect strong light into the German, and Vacily caught this 2-3 second time to shoot the guy. Also, the emotions part between Vacily and the girl is also attractive.",8,0,2,4 January 2002
A Beautiful Mind," whose mind?
","Whose beautiful mind?  Nash's?  His wife's? My guess is like this: he's finding the beauty of mathematics, and his mind is purely a mathematician's mind, and is full of the beauty of mathematics. Although that mind is wrecked by imaginations, illuminations.  Maybe the mathematical part is beautiful.  Beautiful in a mathematical point of view.",7,0,1,18 September 2002
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," John Woo styled
","I had an impression that this movie is made by John Woo. Since the actions played by Brad and Angelina are just flamboyant! This complies to John's 'violence aesthetics' doctrine. Though I'm not quite sure of it, I'm by all means intrigued by their body actions. I think this is the shining point of this movie, and the reason to make it attractive.Now, after I've looked up the IMDb data, I know it's not John, but I'm happier to know it, because this means John's style is influential to Hollywood. Ask the director if he's affected by John Woo. And my email is rtan_cn@yahoo.com.cn.Doug, if you've seen this comment, please contact me!",9,9,17,18 October 2005
Shrek," You ARE beautiful...
","Though it's said to be the first pure computer graphics created animation('Toy Story' was not that 'pure'?).  I was attracted by not only the visual effect stuff.  It is amusing by its American-styled humors: like Shrek's saying to the princess that he's a 'delivery boy'.  And what's more important, I like the ending, when the princess said 'I'm supposed to be beautiful', when the sunset brought her an ugly looking.  Then Shrek answered, 'But you ARE beautiful!'",9,0,0,11 August 2001
Vanilla Sky," Always the old styles...
","In the first section, I can see only Tom Cruise playing his old styled roles.  I just wonder how long can Tom keep on make money by his face like this.  Though in the rest of the story, he did have his face deteriorated, however, his old looking was resumed.  Maybe the final part, when he commited suicide kinda solved the conflict in his mind. I still think, for Tom Cuise, only 'Born on the 4th of July' is okay.  All the others, are worthless go-go movies.",5,0,0,16 March 2002
Amélie," another Audrey!
","Audrey Hepburn was always my favorite star.  Now here's finally another Audrey!  Though not the same pretty as Hepburn, I found her looking so much like Audrey Hepburn in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's', with a pair of sunglasses and a colorful dress. BTW, talking about the movie itself: those imaginary scenes are funny, look at the dreamy old man turning off the lamp.  This is totally a feature of French movie!",7,0,2,7 December 2003
