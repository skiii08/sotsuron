Source Code," Excellent Thriller
","I have to agree with the previous reviewer. This is the best thriller I've seen in years. Definitely kept me on the edge of my seat.The writing is outstanding. All four principal actors do well and Gyllenhaal, especially, carries the plot forward extremely well.At the start, I feared a stock, predictable Hollywood thriller. But soon I found myself en wrapped in Gyllenhaal's puzzle-within-a puzzle.At the end, the Industry audience for this screening erupted in spontaneous applause.Duncan Jones is definitely a young director to watch.If you like thrillers, go see this film!",9,310,447,20 March 2011
