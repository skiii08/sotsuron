The Hangover," BRILLIANT
","The Hangover is a very innovative and brilliant comedy, you will never stop laughing during the movie thanks to an amazing cast which represents an entertaining group of friends ready to face every unexpected event.
After watching the movie, you will get attached to each character due to their strong foolishness and their usual inappropriate jokes, but everyone has on own different peculiarity, starting by 'Phil' (Bradley Cooper): a badass teacher who manages to handle every difficulty with such an enviable calm, 'Stu' (Ed Helms): a quiet doctor with a demon inside and last but not least 'Alan' (Zach Galifianakis): a crazy preppy who is also a drug user.
After 10 years from its release I always love watching it and in my opinion is still one of the most hilarious Hollywoodian comedies of all time.
I would also like to highlight Zach Galifianakis' astonishing performance, who gave birth to one of the most iconic and funny characters of pop culture, despite he interprets a stupid and mad over-seized man, he did it in a very unique and clever way.
