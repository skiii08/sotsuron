The Blair Witch Project," One of the most frightening films ever
","This movie is serious business, very frightening experience to say the least. Since I am someone who always wanted to make a documentary of my own, I could relate to it more but I am pretty sure, all of us film ourselves during such expeditions these days. The film triumphs in two areas. One in consuming your entire attention span to travel with these three characters, the other in presenting it to you in a more believable, frightening manner (pieced through amateur footage) This movie is an influential work because it then spawned a slew of similarly made movies (although Cannibal Holocaust was made earlier, this seemed more real and entertaining to this day and age). I thoroughly enjoyed the horror aspect of this movie, and I am not someone who finds horror movies very shaking (Except for The Exorcist, of course) but this was quite scary. I felt mind- numbing frustration in situations when the main characters' spirit & tolerance started to decline, and slowly begin to realize how meek, insignificant we are if we are not part of our society or within our comfort zone or left it the dark with an unknown fear factor, with very crazy things happening around you but you can't see or tell what it is. The makers manage to infuse terror in a very natural way too, that's the main success feature of the film. I feel sorry for some viewers in this forum who couldn't enjoy the film because they were trying to make 'sense' out of the characters shooting such frightening situations, calling it unrealistic etc. Probably why IMDb has a low rating for this movie too. It never bothered me, my suggestion is either you don't notice it/disregard it OR you look at film as their passion, or something humans can do in hopeless situations (ie, if I know my fate is sealed in such a terrifying situation, I would consider filming myself so that the world gets to know what happened to me someday, now that I can't save myself anymore). Watch the early interviews with locals carefully (real people) for you to understand the ending very well. Excellent movie. Definitely goes down as one of my all favourites. Cannot think of a major flaw.",8,2,4,31 October 2013
Interstellar," Truly one of the best movies ever made.
","There's something unique about movies that get high ratings on IMDb but disproportionately lower % on RT - love. A beautiful piece of work by Nolan, this film takes on a different dimension of film making - literally. As a revolutionary film maker, he explores path breaking concepts boldly. Even if you are not a science geek you will easily 'get' and enjoy the language used for story telling through the universe. The mesmerising play across the realm of time, space and gravity while running a flawless story for 3 hours to perfect closure.While watching I felt like I had been on a journey too through the dimension of time. I had never bent my mind so much so comfortably while watching any movie. Hans Zimmer's music is soul-stealingly haunting. Mcconaughey, Chastain and Hathway put up spectacular performances. Love it.",9,3,9,3 April 2015
American History X," One of the best movies ever made!
","I loved this movie, so well written so beautifully portrayed. This movie made me watch the whole of it in one breath.. it was so powerful. I am not even from the US, never lived there.. but the movie carried a universal message for everyone. I do not intend to really reveal much here about the plot, except to say this story is amongst you, you have heard it, you have seen it around but while watching it through the beautifully artistic eyes of Tony Kaye and through intense, amazing performances of the always amazing Ed Norton, Edward Furlong, and Beverly D'Angelo, you would enjoy it as if you have never had that perspective. This is the beauty of this movie. I could sound overstate its greatness, but i waited 4 months after watching it the first to write a review here, so that I don't really come out & speak out of the immediate after effects. A clean 9/10.",9,0,2,25 July 2014
Joker," Near perfect character arc
","Enough has been written about the movie being worth all the hype. So I'll not go much into it. This is a truly remarkable cinematic work. What stood out most sharply for me was how Todd Phillips painted the picture of Joker - it wasn't at all simplistic, but the complexity is never too labouring for the audience. And his genius actor, Joaquin Phoenix rises above possibly all his expectations to complete a near perfect show! Whether Academy gives the Best Actor to him or not, he's already a winner in all of our hearts. He was phenomenal, I could sense everyone in the audience could feel his pain. And not to mention the costume, set design, camera work and brilliant score. Violence in the movie is absolutely necessary and very tastefully done. Last but not the least, the story is set in the 60s or 70s Gotham City but its message & violence are well adapted to today's hate-filled world. Without a doubt, the best movie this year! 9/10.",9,0,2,20 October 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," The only time I'd call anything The Best Film Ever Made.
","This is it, I have always been so careful on not getting carried away while watching great films and calling it the best. I am talking about the league of The Godfather, Casablanca, The Good The Bad & The Ugly and 12 Angry Men. So I always called each of them one of the best. I never believed THE BEST ever existed. It can't be, right? How can anything be the best or perfect. Definitely not perfect film. There's got to be something wrong somewhere I just need to look close enough.But I was wrong. Although I knew I was all the way. Right from the very first time I watched The Shawshank Redemption on HBO in 1997 (18 years ago) and I waited 18 years, 5 thorough viewings, 1 sceptical review before I wrote my final judgment of this film. This is the best film ever made. Spotless. True classic. And it was not even directed or acted by the legends we know today. Sure they are true legends. But what Frank Dorabont, Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman & their amazing crew did is something extra special. They created the best work on cinema ever with almost none of those legends working on them. This film needs no further description. Ten out of ten in every department of film making. Full of incredible moments. Beauty, class and intellect in almost every scene. You do not need to know the No.1 film status on IMDb for over a decade to actually believe in the power of this genius work of art. This is the best, if there is one. This is the film that reaffirmed my faith in hope, human perseverance and friendship. I'm sure there are many who believe this isn't that great, but I am glad I think otherwise - and believe me, its a great feeling. Of having found the best film, being a huge film lover. 10/10 - the only time I ever did or would do this on IMDb or elsewhere.",10,3,4,27 November 2015
