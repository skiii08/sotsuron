Walk the Line," A movie with heart
","I truly enjoyed this movie. I thought it had a lot of heart and several tender moments. Joaquin Phoenix captured that sad eyed Johnny Cash look. And Reese Witherspoon was sassy and spunky as June Carter.Phoenix's singing was excellent. He sounded very much like Cash and he took on many mannerisms of the singer without looking like a comic imitation. Witherspoon has a very pleasant voice. And in some ways her voice is prettier than Carter's, although she captured the southern twang of the original very well.I felt the movie was not as tightly put together as 'Ray' in that 'Ray' tended to cover more ground, over all, in the life of Ray Charles. However, it must be considered that 'Walk the Line' is dealing with, to a certain extent, the life of Carter as well as Cash's.",8,0,0,9 March 2006
