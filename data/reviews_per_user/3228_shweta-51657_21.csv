Sucker Punch," Well done, well layered, engrossing movie
","This movie was different from the get go. As an audience, you are not given time to acclimatize yourself to the different scenarios and realities presented in the film. You just go with it and try to grasp as much as possible. But damn, this was soo well layered. The ending leaves you thinking to the threefold outcome for a while at least.Right from the first scene, the soundtrack had me downloading the entire OST. What beautiful covers of some classic songs! Sweet dreams especially set the tone for the entire film. Another standout: Oscar Issac. After Ex Machina, we all know he can play a negative character. But here, he does so with aplomb! Decent acting by the rest of the all female cast as well. Do watch and enjoy this, its certainly nothing like what I expected.",8,3,5,1 February 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Was a better prequel ever made??
","I left this movie with one intention: to go watch the original trilogy all over again! This movie was soo brilliantly made, every detail so well thought out, it was, honestly, a marvel to watch. Its such a wonder to me how a movie made in 2016 could have tied in SO AMAZINGLY with the first part released in 1977! The transition from the ending of this movie progresses seamlessly to the movie that sets off the original trilogy that began nearly 40 years ago. I attended the film with someone who was not a fan at all. But he didn't need an intro or an explanation prior. Certainly, he was full of questions later, (so Darth Vader is bad news, huh?), but as the movie opens right in the middle of the War between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance, you are filled right in with the nature of War and its effects on our heroes (It was odd however, not seeing the usual open credits roll up as the movie begins).Diego Luna was a pleasure to watch. Knowing his incredible acting prowess from movies such Milk, he carried off Cassian Andor with aplomb and with this movie has certainly garnered female attention (me included). Ben Mendelsohn was so good in his bad role, he was great. I thought Alan Tudyk's K-2SO would be a hard sale against the legendary droids (3PO and R2, who btw, who also have a few seconds in this movie) and BB8, but his comedic timing won me over.What caught me by surprise was the portrayal of Grand Moff Tarkin. I knew at the back of my head that Peter Cushing had passed away but his portrayal was done so well, I had to double check! His role was reprised to near perfection by (I found out later) Guy Henry and the help of CGI. What was a first for me, I realised as the red lightsaber lit up the screen in the dark .. was that this was the first time in MY lifetime that I was able to watch Darth Vader on the big screen. And oh dear lord. Did he deliver. I had goosebumps! Never did I think that in my life would I sit in the theatre as a movie goer and ever get to feel frightened for our heroes as the Imperial March plays in the background. But I did. This wasn't on TV, or a DVD, but was happening in real time for me for the first time ever! (in the theatre, but, hell, you know what I mean)I now understand how desperate the fans back in the 70s and 80s must have been, impatiently waiting for the next part to be released, waiting eagerly all year round for the next one.Thankfully, May is only 5 months away. But until then, may the Force be with you.",10,2,6,31 December 2016
This Is the End," Go in with zero expectations and you will actually laugh out loud
","Dont get me wrong, I am embarrassed that I enjoyed this movie as much as I actually did, but there is no denying that it got me laughing out loud and hitting repeat on some scenes. This movie is pure silliness and just fun. Goes without saying dont expect too much and you wont be let down.",8,1,1,5 May 2019
World War Z," One of the best Zombie movies out there
","And trust me, I have watched them all. From the classics in the 80s to all the rubbish new ones. This one had me pausing to catch my breathe at soo many different parts in the movie, I honestly dont recommend it lightly. I can understand why Brad Pitt attached himself to the project and produced it, its well written, well paced and ticks all the right boxes. Its a bit far fetched I will admit but the movie pulls it off with aplomb! You heart will race, you will be whispering 'kill it, kill it' or 'run, run, faster' under your breathe through out the movie. I went in to the movie watching it with apprehension because if you have seen one zombie flick you have seen them all. But honestly, from the first scene it was handled really well. Its cheesy, campy but oh its soo good!",8,2,3,8 September 2018
Ed Wood," You're the ruler of the Galaxy, Show A Little Taste!
","Another successful collaboration between Burton and Depp. This movie offers a good insight into Ed Wood and Hollywoodland back in the day. I only came to know Ed Wood through this movie. Depp has done well by bringing him to life in this black and white light drama, his portrayal eliciting laughs from the viewer, but never full blown pity. His sheer optimism despite his circumstances is endearing and comical.Together with a good cast, the director brings out a believable portrayal of the campy movie director that was once tagged as the Worst Director of All Time. Martin Landau's likeness to Bela Lugosi was laudable. I have to say, the sound on this movie would take you right back to the black and white era of Hollywood. Think Bride of the Frankenstein.If for nothing else, watch this movie for the one liners. The one liners in this movie are the best thing about it, in my opinion!",7,0,0,13 January 2017
Thor: Ragnarok," Fun, entertaining shallow Marvel movie
","Don't get me wrong, it's far better than Suicide Squad, (oh sweet Lord, nearly any popcorn film these days is). Its very entertaining. But it's a fluff popcorn film. Honestly, good for a one time watch but you won't regret paying for the popcorn. Hence the 8 on 10. Some scenes could have been done with a touch of class. Some scenes were executed beautifully and I couldn't ask for more.The comedy in the movie wasn't overkill, rather it was very tastefully done. But overall, an entirely shallow movie and it didn't have to be, it had immense potential to milk tears, ( the producers decided otherwise I suppose).Huge potential to be deep and dark and overly frightening. I'm not complaining. How can I? They used Led Zeppelin in the soundtrack. I just wish it wasn't treated as popcorn flick which it sadly is. Hemsworth on the other hand. Who knew he could do comedy? Apparently, Director Taika Waititi did! Hela was a nice surprise too. Oh. And Mark Ruffalo was on screen having loads of fun. Do watch. No regrets here",8,1,4,5 November 2017
Snatch," Funny, witty, crazy paced movie by Guy Ritchie
","I have yet to see a bad Guy Ritchie film. He just doesn't seem to get his formula wrong ever. It is a well thought, smart comedy which will keep your attention right till the end. You can tell it is a Guy Ritchie film by the similarities it bore to Lock, Stock. But this one definitely stands its own ground.This movie is paced so quick, each part written so well, edited so brilliant, you really don't want to miss a single scene. The story ties in really well with the different characters and each of their own subplots. I can not pinpoint my favourite actor in this movie. Every actor has done a brilliant job. I have to say, if nothing, watch this movie for the dog that squeaks. Those scenes are downright hilarious.",8,0,2,14 January 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Slightly dissapointed, lacked a certain depth and magic but not too shabby either
","Its finally ended.. the longest successful running franchise of all time! Breaks my heart a bit, really. Mostly because it wasn't done as well as you wanted it to be made. The film left me feeling ambiguous .. It lacked the magic of the first trilogy and some parts just didnt make much sense in the longer context of things. On the other hand, some scenes were done soo well and you couldnt have asked for a better ending to character arcs. This balances it out, which sort of salvages the film overall really, but I wont deny that I wanted more. It was a thrill seeing old (but never forgotten faces) on the screen again. John Williams's music as always was amazing and hair raising.Look, everyone is going to b*itch and crib it. But are they still going to watch the movie? Hell yea, we are. Lets just stop hating and try some loving and enjoy the last film of the trilogy and indeed of the series (?). It will make you laugh and cry.",7,2,6,2 January 2020
Pacific Rim," A good popcorn film
","I can see why people loved this movie but I can also why its only rated a 6.9.So lets start with whats good: great idea, great story, great execution. Loving the acting from certain cast members, they have used actors to their strengths here. Charlie Day stands out and so does Idris Elba. Cant not commend the effort made by the art and graphics department in this movie. Scenes spanning a few minutes on the screen have very painfully and artfully been translated which needs a shout out.And now for what went wrong: Theres too much happening.. This could have been packaged better. Maybe as a mini tv series or a two part movie or since Hollywood seems to love trilogies, they could have gone for a whole bonanza. But at 2 hours and 11 minutes long, you really feel the length of the movie in the second half. The acting and dialogue in certain scenes is just too painful to watch. Certain aspects of the story could have been handled better but now I am just nitpicking.Overall a pure popcorn flick. Nothing wrong with that, especially when it is done so well.",7,0,0,20 September 2019
Pitch Black," Absolutely enjoyable
","Loved the movie. The two leads did a heck of a job to carry the movie. Captivating story and great execution. The best bits of the movie in order are 1. Vin Diesel: I don't think I have seen him pre-Fast Furious franchise but if this is his prowess then FF have absolutely not utilized his skills. The shoulder dislocating scene alone..! (some effects were used, but it was real). His portrayal of a psychopath is really good. 2. the Imagery. LOVED IT. The colours, the lighting, the negative scenes, all really good. The aliens themselves could have been better but hey. 3. The soundtrack keeps a good pace with the movie. Overall, totally enjoyable.",8,2,2,24 February 2017
Avengers: Endgame," Dont even try- NOTHING will prepare you
","I laughed, I cried, I exclaimed, I cried, I laughed, I cried and then I kept crying.Rest assured, the writers do our heroes every justice they deserve, by closing long running arcs beautifully, albeit, sadly. It is a painful goodbye to the Infinity arc but they've done it superbly. The endgame of over 20 films, a saga spanning 11 years has culminated into something so powerful, so awe inspiring on the screen, I urge every one to watch it to feel firsthand, the beauty, the pain and triumph of our heroes.Stan Lee is up there somewhere, smiling. And we too will learn to smile through our tears.",10,18,48,24 April 2019
The Lion King," Goosebumps throughout the film
","Let me say first off, the 1994's version is the epitome of my childhood. I would cry every time the wildebeest scene would come (like all of you did too, I am sure), the music shaped my childhood, the beloved characters I recognise as my own friends. The backyard of Pride Rock is where I played and grew up. The 1994 movie is one of the first clear memories of my childhood. My father bought the LCD (laser disks for you Gen-Zs and Millennials who dont remember this relic from the 90s) and after it became obsolete, the VHS copy which we still have, safely tucked away somewhere, collecting dust. I was a year old when the movie came out, yet my father's pride in his LCD sound system resulted in the Lion King being played quite frequently on the weekends at my house. I remember my elder brother crying and running to the kitchen so he wouldnt see the wildebeests in that pivotal scene.What I am trying to tell you is The Lion King holds a very special place in my heart. And I was very very worried on hearing it was to be remade. What I feared worst was a repeat of Ghostbusters. Thankfully this isnt the case here. When I heard Jon Favreau was behind the helm, I felt we could all rest easy, he wouldnt botch it up and he didnt! He understood what it was to stay true to the real spirit and magic of the film and still take advantage of modern technology to only make the film experience better.This movie from start to finish, was a sensory experience of unbelievable proportions. Goosebumps from the opening scene, right until the end. The music, oh my god. The music! They have stayed true to the original versions and still managed to incorporate music from the original African roots. I loved the life John Oliver, Seth Rogen, Beyonce gave the characters through just their voices. So grateful that James Earl Jones, the one true king, was able to lend his voice to bring to life the majesty and regality of Mufasa. Have to say Chiwetel Ejiofor did not bring the magic to Scar the way Jeremy Irons did. If anything thats my only complaint.The visuals, oh my god.. The magic of animated version was brought to life so remarkably, it takes your breathe away. Imagine revisiting your favourite childhood haunts as an adult, with every vague and hazy memory brought to life with such vivid colours and detail, you cant imagine how the artists did it. And the music.. the new versions by Hans Zimmer will have you singing along and bopping your foot and still catch you by surprise.Dont listen to the haters, the movie is a treat and a trip down childhood for all us 90s kids.",8,0,2,11 February 2020
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Pirate's Life for me
","Let me start off by stating, I nodded off during Stranger Tides. The movie was a complete waste of my time and it besmirched a very good franchise. I refused to complete the movie till date. If something takes that much of effort to watch, I'd really rather go put my efforts into anything else. But with this movie? They hit their usual stride again. Fast paced, good action scenes. I think I subconsciously knew that if they managed to incorporate Hans Zimmer phenomenal score from the trilogy into this movie, in a way that satisfied me, I would give it 8 on 10 ( I keep my promises). But the movie did more than deliver and stay true to the original trilogy. It brought back the feelings of old. I wont give away spoilers but I was very happy to see old faces return to the screen. They have also laid down good groundwork for the new generation of characters. I wouldn't mind sticking about to see how this soft reboot gets along with out the original characters. Do watch, you will be pleasantly surprised.",8,13,27,9 June 2017
Million Dollar Baby," A searing movie
","I can not give this movie enough praise. I just can not. Acting. Direction. Story. Pacing. Just everything. I am afraid of saying too little for fear of not doing justice to the film but I am afraid of saying too much, I would rather just suggest you watch it and enjoy. This is by no means an easy film. I can however state with firmness that with each watch, it will unravel more layers to the story, the acting and the dialogue between the characters. This movie will haunt you for a long time, for more reasons than I dare to put down here. I can only hope my minds picks up on the more happier scenes than the darker ones.",10,0,2,12 January 2017
Black Hawk Down," They won the battle but lost the war
","This is one of the most accurate adaptations of a book to a screen I have seen. The Battle of the Black Sea was considered a failure by the men eventually in the White House but not by the men who fought there that day.The movie shows the story of the veteran Delta team and the young, innocent, naive and idealistic Rangers and their ordeal through October 3rd 1993 in Mogdishu, Somalia. It showed the shocking, futility of war through fast paced camera work and sound work.So many scenes in the book were brought to life in the movie. Jaime Smith's death after getting injured in the field and not having medical evacuation being approved was poignant and painful in the book and is every bit painful to watch as it was painful to read.
Another scene that translated well from the book was the absolute shocking ending where the rescue convoy comprising of 10th Mountain simply and Malay soldiers simply had no room so the soldiers who had no water, no respite for hours, fighting were their lives were made to run on foot alongside the convoy, a convoy that eventually sped up, leaving the men to make their own way to friendly grounds. The book indicates the shock and outrage of the ordeal, but the movie really delivered that scene better. I cant describe the feeling of helplessness the soldiers must have felt in this situation from their country.Ridley Scott did an stellar job adapting Mike Bowden's book to the screen. 8/10.",8,0,0,8 January 2020
The Water Diviner," Beautiful and painful, but you cant look away
","Russel Crowe's directorial debut and what a movie. After years of playing the lead actor, he takes on the director's role as well as producer's while still playing the lead actor in the role of a father who loses his three sons in the battle of Gallipoli and against all odds and hardships, he vows to travel to Turkey to find them. At times beautiful, at times extremely painful to watch, you cant stop watching. Its amazing how Crowe was able to capture so many emotions on screen.. This was a movie that I had lying around and for no better use of my evening, I decided to watch it. I was shocked by the pain in it and the emotions it brings forward in pivotal scenes.4 on 5 stars, but 5 to Crowe personally. Do watch but keep a tissue handy.",8,1,2,24 October 2018
The Greatest Showman," This is where I want to be..!
","I usually detest musicals (Sound of Music being the greatest exception to this statement) as I dont find the music enthralling and captivating. More often than not, I find myself drifting off during the musical bit, waiting for it to come to an end and wait for the story to progress. 
The Greatest Showman on the other hand was a real show. The music builds and flows and has its own life in the movie. Catchy, beautifully lyrical, intense and delivered superbly by each and every actor in the movie. I can still hear the music and beats in my ears while I type this. I go a step further and say I might get the soundtrack, this movie was that fantastic!",8,1,3,25 June 2018
Unbroken," Not an easy film to watch but worth it nonetheless
","Well, Angelina Jolie has established she can direct and she can direct well.The movie isnt easy to watch but dont get me wrong, it is because of the content. Jolie has been able to convey a tough subject artfully, depicting violence and pain in equal measure with human redemption. The scenes towards the end of the movie are quite powerful.Jack O'Connell has outdone himself from the last time I saw him in Eden Lake. To give such a powerful and emotional performance at the age pf 24 is remarkable.. This one deserves every accolade that comes his way for his portrayal of Louie Zamparini in this movie.",7,0,2,31 October 2018
Cloud Atlas," Well adapted, multi layered movie
","I am usually of the kind to read before I watch. And in the case of this movie, I am certainly glad that I did so, the themes used in this movie go much above the regular movie goers taste. I do realise that this means that those who haven't read the book will have a hard time understanding what is being presented, but I do hope to make the viewers try.This is a movie that has taken 6 very different stories, very different settings and themes and yet managed to weave a fantastical tale that has a deeper and more layered agenda. Sure, it is long, but don't good things come to those that wait? As the audience, I had my favourite segments and not so favourite segments. My favourite even while reading the book was Robert Frobisher. The adaptation of his part was brought to life by almost perfection by Ben Wisham. One part that took me completely and pleasantly by surprise: the enacting of Old Georgie. A standing ovation to Hugo Weaving, the costume designer and the make up artist for bringing a concept like Georgie to the screen. Everything from the top hat to the nails, just well done. The movie certainly takes a few liberties but never have I seen a movie so painstakingly adapted (franchises not counting). The make up?! The setting?! One of the liberties hugely taken or maybe I myself never picked up on it was having actors from each segment play a different role in another segment. It was certainly not hinted at in the book except for the main character. This one left me pondering and I think it was a mistake as how can one be evil in one life but good in another? Overlooking this one fact, loved the movie in all its entirety.",8,2,3,30 June 2017
Warcraft," Intense, captivating, enThralling! (see what I did there?)
","I went into this with very little expectations (the last movie I saw being Assassin's Creed, this is understandable). And WoW, oh Wow, (okay, I know, I should stop). I loved this. I didn't expect it to be so captivating, but the CG and cinematography! As it pulled me in, what struck me was how they cinematography was positioned to depict actual game-play. Another similarity to the games, was how as the story is being played out, the viewer sees both sides of the war and the internal debate is never answered as to who wins or more importantly, who do we want to win. Your heart ends up beating for both sides. All talk of how this does justice to the games aside, I think even non players can watch this, it is thoroughly enjoyable and it just does not quit. I had no idea about the background of this story however, having played only Reign of Chaos and Frozen Throne, but despite that, I absolutely enjoyed this! I cant wait to see what Blizzard releases next in this franchise! Loved the cast: Dominic Cooper, Travis Fimmel. Ben Schnetzer as was likable as Khadgar. Maybe even Arthas will make an appearance next time?",8,1,3,8 January 2017
Beetlejuice," Michael Keaton is a star!
","Burton is at his absolute ridiculous, out of the ordinary, downright weird best here! His sense of odd ball nuttiness was brought out perfectly in the characters. His use of stop motion animation only adds to the feel of the movie.BRILLIANT SETS. And now. For the best bit: Michael Keaton. THAT WAS ACTING. Not a boring moment to be had while he was on camera. I had no idea, he could act like that! His body language, delivery, his eccentricity! Whoever did his makeup did a great job.The only thing better than Keaton was the Dinner Party scene. That if nothing else gets an 4 on 5 from me. The actors acting out that scene stayed in character so darn well, I watched it twice. Watch the movie for that bizarre and hilarious scene if for nothing else!",8,1,1,29 March 2017
