Gremlins," Grembrilliant
","I was lucky enough to see Gremlins on the big screen a few days ago after a 10 year or so stint without seeing this masterpiece. I was reminded on what a fantastic peice of filmmaking that Gremlins is, it stands head and shoulders above all eighties monster flicks and as a eighties horror it also fares very well. Comparing to it's peers, The Goolies, Critters etc seems a little unfair, the story is sharp, fast paced and is carried by all the actors. It has the distinct feel of a B movie but the dialouge at the end reminds us that we have seen a film which dares to be corny and comes out trumps. On top of all this it is the best peice of anti-CGI work since the Jason and the Argonauts Skellington fight. The models show real character from the unquestionably adorable mogwi puppet to the humerous yet somehow frightening gremlins. Had this film been made in the last 8 or 9 years the character of the film would have been lost and along with that half the fun. Take the scene where Spike is followed by thousands of Gremlins all stomping their tiny legs, to the audience this isn't perfect animation by any means but the movement gives them real character. When I read reviews that state this movie is predictable and one dimensional I remind myself that idiots that make comments like this must've forgotten that from start to finish the movie is presented as a ghost story. The essence of any good ghost story is telling you a moral. However predictable it is. When the moral is as well presented as this anyone who doesn't enjoy the film should check their pulse.",Null,1,2,25 February 2003
Catch Me If You Can," I've given up.
","hi, My names Pip Hodgkinson and before I go any further I'd justlike to say Speilberg is one of the most fantastic directors in thisday and age, but this film is the last straw.Why oh why can't he end a movie? With AI I was a little upset, buton a second viewing I was satisfied with the glossy ending. WithMinority Report I was in a world of my own until he went off on hisBrian De Palmer tour of filmmaking! And on a second viewing Iwas just as upset that he managed what could have been thefinest film last year look very ordinary with the last 20minutes. SoCatch Me If You Can was his chance of redemption, prove that hehas a little more variety in his abilities as a filmmaker thanconstantly not being to end a film (god knows what would havehappened if he'd directed the Ice Storm!) so image my distresswhen I'm loving the movie, pleased with the plot,pace andperformances then bang. Theres an ending, but no Steven doesn'twant to leave us with any distaste in our mouths so he takes us offon a 15minute buddy movie style ending, oh at first they wereagainst each other then now! the work with each other! Wow didntsee that one coming. If Minority Reports ending reminded me ofMission Impossible then Catch Me if you can was Dragnet.  Thenhe manages to do the most lazy straight to tv trick in the history ofcinema. Oh yeah you got it, he uses the rolling text to make surewe understand that it IS an happy ending.So while I celebrated both Minority Report and AI as good films thatcould have been great. Catch Me If You Can is not its a disgrace, ithad all the makings of being ten times better than both the beforementioned films and one of the best films of the year but hemanages to make the film ordinary with its ending.  So why shouldwe praise this movie?Speilberg is the greatist movie maker for the openings to his films,take Jaws, Saving Private Ryan, Indiana Jones (all three) and nowCatch Me If You Can and you can see a genius at work. But I find itvery hard to find an exceptional Speilberg ending since Jaws?Surely thats as or more important than the start?",6,0,2,6 February 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Better than The first?
","Controversial I know, but over the past four days I''ve seen this film 3 times and its grown each time. I'm not a massive fan of the Terminator francise, but i've loved Schwartzenegger ever since I can remember, his recent downfall in ratings and reviews needed to stop and T3 was the perfect way to do this. He provides a performance which is the greatist by any leading man in an action film since? what True lies? I don't know, he conveys power, but also willing to laugh at himself. Does Vin Deisel do this? Does Will Smith command the screen every time he's on it? Arnie has proved with this movie he is a star at another level to the before mentioned actors. His fee he picked up was deserved as it would not have been a movie without him.Arnies not the only good thing about this film don't make any mistake about that. John Mostow creates a vision which no other director has dared do over the past few years, take a high budget film and dare cut it down to under 2hrs, sometimes a long picture deserves its length, The two lord of the rings films could not have been cut down, the size of narrative Peter Jackson is conveying deserves more screen time not less. Lets take other narratives though, the Matrix? it should have been shorter or not made, Hulk undoing was making a 2 1/2 hr film out of such a simple idea, people get bored, and in the end remember trudgeing through endless minutes of dialouge which is pretentious and meaningless rather than the sequences which did inspire awe. I was guilty of this with Hulk myself. John Mostow has broken the mould, he's taken a simple chase story and made it the length it should be, and i'm sorry but the ten minute fight scene between the T101 and the TX p****s on the proverbial parade of any of the 20 minute monster fights in matrix reloaded! You just get bored.Character development is riskey and underrated in this movie thats Mostow and all the other actors taking the limelight.Okay it cost 140m to make, thats a lot of money, and it's fair to demand an exceptional movie. Thats most peoples problem with this film, But this film is a lesson in making films to all the would be action directors and actors, make sure its not to long, unless it needs be, use real explosions and cars whereever you can, and get a star to perform in the movie, a name, who wasn't a little excited when the austrian oaks name fills the screen before the title of the film comes up?For these simple lessons i give this movie 9/10  I give the same to T2 and I give 8/10 to The Terminator. T3 can kick the industry up the arse and show producers that just because it's costing loads it doesn't need hours of screen time and CGI being used to it's death. In an ideal world Arnold and Mostow will have recovered the action genre so the next Bond film is worth watching and the Matrix Revolutions doesn't get the hype of Reloaded. (and Vin Deisel will never work again!)A cult classic.How often do you say that about a $140m film?",Null,0,0,5 August 2003
