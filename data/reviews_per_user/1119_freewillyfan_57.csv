The Avengers," The Avengers
",The Avengers was kind of ground breaking for its time. It was the first time all these heroes were brought together and Joss Whedon pulled it off beautifully. The cast is great and they work together wonderfully. The action is great and the final act is amazing. The villain Loki is great even though his plan is one of the take over the world plans. The first bit of the film is slower paced but I thought that it worked well. This was a great movie.9.2/10,9,0,0,3 November 2019
The Incredible Hulk," The Incredible Hulk
",This is the best Hulk solo movie in my opinion. That being said I don't think it is an amazing film. The action is entertaining but average. The cast is good and the villain is decent but the plot is fairly forgettable. There's not much about this movie that stands out to me even when ignore the fact that it is the forgotten MCU film. At times I find this film can get kind of boring. I would say the final act is fun and when the Hulk first shows is good.6.3/10,6,0,0,2 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Phantom Menace
","The Phantom Menace is a disappointing addition to the saga. It is quite dull compared to the others. The cast is a mixed bag and the plot is not overly interesting. The duel scene at the end was fantastic and the best part about this film. The whole film is forgettable, other than that duel scene. When I was young I liked jar jar but not I find him more annoying.5.8/10",6,0,0,30 November 2019
Skyfall," Skyfall
","Skyfall is the third Daniel Craig Bond film and is my personal favourite in the franchise at the moment. All their performances are great. The opening scene is amazing and this film has great action and a great plot. The villain is great, although he could have been it in more. There isn't really a main Bond girl and instead the film expands the relationship between Bond and M which I really liked. The film also expands on bonds back Story which I liked as well. I loved the final act and it felt more personal compared many other Bond films. The directing is great and the film looks terrific. Not only is this my favourite Bond film, it is one of my most favourite movies of all time.9.7/10",10,2,5,2 November 2019
Iron Man 3," Iron Man 3
","Iron Man 3 does a good job of showing the effects that the events in The Avengers had on tony. In this film we see a lot more of Tony Stark rather than Iron Man which I liked. Robert Downy Jr is once again great. The action is a lot of fun in this, I really liked the final battle and there is good humour in this film. I didn't mind the twist with the villain because I never read the comics so didn't know who he was but I can understand why it upset people. I do think that the film might have been better had they not done the twist because the real villain was not great. Also some stuff that was done at the end of the movie was ignored in the future movies. But overall there is a lot of fun in this film and it is better then the second Iron Man .8.0/10",8,0,0,3 November 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Rogue One
",Rogue One is pretty good and entertaining but I felt that it lacked the heart and charm that most Star Wars films have. The characters we're very forgettable and at times the film got slow. The film is visually stunning compared to most in the franchise and has some good action. The Darth Vader scene at the end being the stand out. The story is also quite good but with the characters not being interesting it's hard to be as invested in this film as I wanted to be. Still it can be entertaining.7.0/10,7,1,1,30 November 2019
Captain Marvel," Captain Marvel
",Captain Marvel is an entertaining film but not one of the best from the MCU. Brie Larson is pretty good but at times seems a little wooden. I really liked the twist with the villain and the story is pretty good. The action is enjoyable but nothing too special. Nick Fury is the stand out in my opinion. For the most part the stuff in here is good but not great.7.5/10,7,3,6,3 November 2019
Iron Man 2," Iron Man 2
",Iron Man 2 is a decent follow up to the first. The cast is great again and there are some fun action scenes. The race scene and the final fight are quite good. Unfortunately there are multiple plots that make the film feel a little messy and the stories just aren't as interesting as the first movie's. We get an introduction to Black Widow in this which is great. Overall there's fun to be had but nothing amazing about this film and it doesn't have the same freshness as the first.6.7/10,7,1,1,2 November 2019
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," X-Men Origins Wolverine
",This is definitely the worst of the Wolverine films and at the moment worst of the X-men films. The opening was actually pretty good and Hugh Jackman is great as always and Liev Schreiber was really good in the film. The CGI in this is terrible and what they did to Deadpool was awful. There can be fun to be had with the action but the plot is pretty dull and I thought at one point it got a little too convoluted.4.5/10,4,1,2,2 November 2019
Aquaman," Aquaman
",Aquaman is a fairly fun film. Jason Momoa is great as Aquaman and has some fun moments. There is some fun action and great visuals in it. The villain is alright and the plot is good. Similar to Black Panther though. It gets cheesy and has so many typical movie trope. Most of the humour fell flat for me. Some of the cheesiness got too much for me. Overall entertaining but not a great film.6.3/10,6,0,0,9 November 2019
Deadpool 2," Deadpool 2
",Deadpool 2 is a great sequel to the first. It's funny and has some great action scenes. The villain in this is an improvement over the first. The new characters are are great for the most part. The kid has alright.the twist through me off for a while but now I can accept it. The film do feel as fresh as the first but it still lots of fun to watch.8.8/10,9,2,2,2 November 2019
X-Men," X-men
",X-Men help to start the Modern day superhero movies. It's quite good with telling it's story and the cast is perfect. There's not a whole lot of action but the story is pretty good. The effects haven't held up to well and Halle Barry's performance is a little over the top. But all the others are great. Overall a good start to the X-Men franchise.8.0/10,8,1,1,2 November 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Thor Ragnarok
",Thor Ragnarok is a huge step up from the first two Thor movies. This one is less serious and is in my opinion the funniest film in the MCU. The CGI is good in this and the villain is good. Thor and Loki are great and there are some great new additions in this movie. The action is great and I loved the final act and the use of the immigrant song in the film. This was a very fresh entry in the MCU and one of my favourites.9.2/10,9,1,6,3 November 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spider-Man Homecoming
",Spider-Man Homecoming is a very fun film and one of the best Spider-Man films. Tom Holland is great as Spider-Man and the rest of the cast is great. I thought Robert Downy Jr was used well and the villain was great. The action is fun but does lack the intensity of other Spider-Man movies. It was a fun film that is very rewatchable.8.8/10,9,1,1,3 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Return of the Jedi
","Return of the Jedi is a great conclusion to the original Star Wars trilogy. Is might not be as good as the first two but it is still great. It starts off a little slow but picks up the pass and gets really fun and exciting again. The final confrontation between Luke, Vader and the Emperor was perfect. I can see why some people don't like the ewokes but I actually like them. Overall this is a very fun and satisfying conclusion.8.5/10",9,0,2,30 November 2019
Suicide Squad," Suicide Squad
","Suicide Squad is a pretty boring film in my opinion. Will Smith and Margret Robbie were really good and the two best characters. It didn't find it funny, the action was entertaining enough and the plot was a pretty good premise. The villain was vary bad. Most characters were forgettable and the Joker was very disappointing. In my opinion this is the worst DCEU film at the moment.4.6/10",5,1,2,9 November 2019
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Captain America the Winter Soldier
",Captain America the Winter Soldier is an amazing sequel and one of the best movies in the MCU in my opinion. This film has a great villain and some of the action and fight scenes are the best in the MCU. This film is more serious and grittier the most MCU films. It feels like a political spy thriller mix with superheroes. The addition of Falcon in the MCU was great and black window was very good in the film. Overall it is a fantastic movie.9.3/10,9,2,3,3 November 2019
Doctor Strange," Doctor Strange
","Doctor Strange is a fun film that introduces magic into the MCU. Some of the CGI is amazing in this and the final battle I thought was clever. The cast is great and has lots of fun moments. The plot feels a little formulaic but it's good. The villain is Ok, but the rest is good.8.1/10",8,1,1,3 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The Rise of Skywalker
","The Rise of Skywalker was in my opinion a disappointing ending for the saga. To start of with the good, the acting was great and some of the visuals were stunning. I enjoyed the Lightsaber duels and this film is very well paced I thought. It never got slow it just kept moving. The final battle with the starships was pretty epic too. Unfortunately there was a lot that brought this film down for me. To start, the reveal that Rey is Palpatine's granddaughter was kind of weird. I could see what they were going for but it felt a little confusing when I thought about it more. Also I don't remember them explaining how Palpatine survived from the Return of the Jedi and that fact that he did kind of makes what Darth Vader did feel less meaningful. Luke was barely in it which I was not happy about. Some stuff they did with Kylo Ren I liked but when he turned to the light side and came to help Rey, that felt like it could have been handled much better and it fell flat for me. Finally the actual 'Rise if Skywalker' was very disappointing. It was just Rey calling herself a Skywalker now and I think all the actual bloodline Skywalker' are dead. So overall I wouldn't say it quite the worst Star Wars but it was the most disappointing. For me it doesn't quite get a 6/10 (I just rounded that score) because of the major issues I have even though it has a fair bit to keep you entertained.5.7/10",6,1,4,21 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Attack of the Clones
",Once again in this film the cast is a mixed bag and the dialog is very poor at times. The CGI is very bad and the plot feels a little unfocused. The action is good at times and the scene when Anakin's mother dies is good and probably the stand out scene. There is no chemistry between the two leads and at times it feels a little awkward. At the moment this is my least favourite Star Wars film.5.5/10,5,1,3,30 November 2019
Ant-Man," Ant-Man
",Ant-Man is a small movie but a lot of fun. Paul Rudd is perfect as Ant-Man. The heist story is very good and this movie is very funny. The side characters are great and a lot of fun. The villain is bland and boring. Other than that this is is fun movie and one of the most rewatchable films in the MCU.8.2/10,8,1,1,3 November 2019
Captain America: The First Avenger," Captain America the First Avenger
","Captain America the First Avenger is a solid origin story and a good start to the Captain America trilogy. The cast is great and the villain, Red Skull, is decent. The movie is very good before he becomes Captain America and the final act is good. The film drags a bit in the middle with the montages and the Captain America stage performance stuff. Other than that a good movie.7.7/10",8,2,2,3 November 2019
The Bourne Ultimatum," The Bourne Ultimatum
",The Bourne Ultimatum is in my opinion the best in the franchise. It is once again very fast passed and the action is at its best in this film. Matt Damon again is great and so is the rest of the cast. This movie has my most favourite scene in the series when Bourne tricks the person after him to leave his office and then Bourne sneaks in while he's gone. We finally learn the truth about Bourne and it has a very satisfying conclusion. Overall and amazing action film and a great entry to the series.9.6/10,10,0,0,2 November 2019
The Bourne Identity," The Bourne Identity
",The Bourne Identity is a very good and interesting movie about the character Jason Bourne. Out of all the movies in the series this one is the character study. Bourne has forgotten everything about his past and spends his time trying to figure out who he is and it is all very interesting. Matt Damon is great as Bourne and the action is quite good. The story is great and all the supporting characters are good. This was the perfect start to this franchise.8.5/10,8,1,1,2 November 2019
Justice League," Justice League
","Justice League is a generic and forgettable movie. The plot wasn't too interesting, the new characters were not developed well. Batman was even quite boring compared to how he was in BvS. Superman was alright but that flight scene with him against the rest of the Justice League felt very out of place and he had two of the cheesiest lines in this film. The CGI was bad and the villain was terrible. Some of the humour was good and some decent action. The plot wasn't anything special and there wasn't really anything that was very memorable about this film. Overall a disappointing first team up film for the DCEU.5.5/10",5,0,1,9 November 2019
Man of Steel," Man of Steel
","For me, Man of Steel is a mixed bag. Henry Cavil is really good as Superman. I like the darker tone and seeing him struggle with his powers when he is younger. The action was good for a while but after a while it became to much for me and it no longer felt like Superman to me. That's were my biggest issues lie. Some of the CGI in the battles wasn't great. I didn't mind Superman Killing the villain. It's entertaining but at times it doesn't feel like Superman and the action becomes too much at times.6.2/10",6,1,1,9 November 2019
X-Men: Days of Future Past," X-Men Days of Future Past
","This one of my most favourite superhero movies ever. I loved that this film brought the original cast and knew cast together. The performance are great, it's fun and there are great character interactions. There is some great action and the plot is great. I liked Mystique in this much more then in the previous film. The villain is ok but doesn't have much motivation to be doing what he is doing. Overall a fantastic movie in my opinion.9.4/10",9,1,1,2 November 2019
Captain America: Civil War," Captain America Civil War
",Captain America Civil War is a great Captain America and Avengers movie. It has a great plot and some of the most memorable action scenes. The airport battle and final battle were amazing. The villain was pretty good with understandable motivations but some of the things in his plan that happened were kind of convenient. The introduction to Black Panther and Spider-Man were great. This was a great follow up to Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron.9.1/10,9,1,4,3 November 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Avengers Endgame
","Avengers Endgame is a terrific end to this decade long story. It's slower passed then Infinity War but I think it works. It takes its time to explore what has happened to the characters and what they do in this situation. The Professor Hulk at first throw me off at first but by the end of his first seen I liked it. I was good with the time travel but the way it was created was too easy. I didn't mind the fat though and by the end of the movie he was still fighting strong. I do see why people have a problem with him being the joke in this. I really did enjoy all the time travel, the were some fun and heartfelt moments. The final act was one of the best final acts I have ever seen. The portals scene was great and we finally got to hear the line 'Avengers Assemble'. The action was intense and fun and Iron man's death was handled very well. For me Infinity War was faster passed and more exciting and Endgame was more satisfying and I appreciate the slower pass. To me they are both of same quality and are my two favourites in the MCU.9.4/10",9,1,4,3 November 2019
Quantum of Solace," Quantum of Solace
","Quantum of Solace is the second Daniel Craig film and is in my opinion his worst. I don't hate it, but it's not great. First the villain is bad and the Bond girls aren't great. The plot about the oil was bland and uninteresting. The action is a mix bag. In some scenes it is hard to tell what's going on, but some are fun. I enjoy the foot chase on the rooftops in the beginning. Daniel Craig is still good as Bond. At times this film feels more like a Jason Bourne movie in the way that it is made. Overall it's not great and is forgettable but it has its moments of entertainment.6.3/10",6,0,0,1 November 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Avengers Infinity War
","Avengers Infinity War is an amazing movie that brings all the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy into one film. This is a very fast passed film with fantastic action and character interactions. The villain, Thanos, is the best in the MCU. this film is funny yet tragic at the same time. The cast is terrific and the CGI is good for the most part. At times it gets a little poor unfortunately. Having half the heroes die at the end was very shocking and a great way to go into the next film, even though I know they weren't going to stay dead. Overall a fantastic film.9.4/10",9,0,1,3 November 2019
X-Men: The Last Stand," X-Men the Last Stand
",The third X-Men film is a let down. It's not terrible but it's a drop in quality from the first two films. The cast is once again good and I do enjoy the final battle. The problem is that there are too many plots and non feel like they are fleshed out enough. Even the stuff that was done pretty well was not on the same level as the previous films. The is some fun in the film but the film feels a little unfocused and a let down.6.0/10,6,1,1,2 November 2019
The Bourne Legacy," The Bourne Legacy
",The Bourne Legacy is in my opinion very forgettable and the weakest in the franchise. Jeramy Renner gives a good performance as well as the rest of the cast. Unfortunately the main character in this is not as interesting as Bourne and the plot feels pretty bland too. The action isn't as exciting as the other films. It's entertaining enough but pretty average. Overall forgettable and bland.5.3/10,5,0,1,2 November 2019
X-Men: Apocalypse," X-Men Apocalypse
","This is a disappointing sequel to Days of Future Past. There was a much bigger scope in this film and it didn't work for me. The CGI got quite poor at times and the villain was underwhelming. The start of the movie kept going all over the place and at times got boring. The film also feels a little too long. The cast is good for the most part and there is a very fun scene with Quicksilver. I liked what they did with Magneto in the beginning as well. Some of the new characters are good. The plot is pretty good, just not executed too well. Overall a disappointing film.5.8/10",6,0,0,2 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Last Jedi
","I can definitely see why the Last Jedi divided fans. When I first saw it I wasn't quite sure how I felt. Now I can say overall I enjoy it but I do have a few issues with it. To start the Finn and Rose subplot wasn't very interesting and ultimately led to nothing. Also the way Rose stopped Finn's sacrifice and her reasoning was really stupid. The story between Holdo and Poe was weird I thought. Why she couldn't just tell him she had plan is weird. And Finally Luke's Death. The scene was done very well but to me it just didn't feel justified. Had they waited to the final film then it might have been better. But depending on how he is used in The Rise of Skywalker, I might change my mind on this. As of what's good, I enjoyed everything with Luke and Rey and I didn't mind how Luke was in the Film. I really liked Kylo Ren in this film. Smokes Death didn't bother me and I thought that whole scene was great. As well I like the Luke force projection at the end. So overall it's not without it's issues but I can watch it and enjoy it.7.2/10",6,4,13,30 November 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy," Guardians of the Galaxy
","Guardians of the Galaxy was a wonderful surprise. I didn't know anything about these characters but I loved the characters, cast and the movie. It is very funny and has tones of fun action. The characters are great and the cast works very well together. The story is great and the sets/location are cool. The one issue I have is that the villain is very boring. Besides that it is a very fun movie.9.0/10",9,0,0,3 November 2019
Logan," Logan
","Logan is at the moment my most favourite superhero movie ever. This is the Final time Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart play these roles after 17 years and the both give amazing performances. The young girl in it is very good as well. This film benefits from its R rating. The action is great and the story is too. This film is heartbreaking, yet has moments that feel very happy. It do feel like a superhero movie which I really like. This film looks at things like regret and redemption which really works for the character of Wolverine. This was the best way to send these characters off. Definitely an amazing film.9.6/10",10,0,0,2 November 2019
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Avengers Age of Ultron
",Avengers Age of Ultron is in my opinion an underrated movie. It's not as good as the first but it's still very good. The film isn't as dark as the trailers made it look which was disappointing. And at times the film got a little unfocused when it had to set up other films. Once again the cast is great and the are some great action scenes. The new characters are good and the villain was good but I wished he was darker and less goofy. Still there is a lot to enjoy in the movie.8.0/10,8,0,0,3 November 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Guardians of the Galaxy 2
",The second Guardians of the Galaxy is good but not as good as the first. It is still quite funny and the cast is great again. Yondu gets a good story in this and the villain is good. The plot is not as strong as the first and the movie is a little messier then the first. It is also not as fast passed as the first movie. It was great on first watch but for me it hasn't held up on multiple viewings. Still a fun movie.7.5/10,7,0,1,3 November 2019
Thor," Thor
",The first Thor movie is quite good. The cast is good and Loki is one of the best villains in the MCU. the action is fun and some of the fish out of water stuff is funny. The film does drag a bit when Thor is on Earth and the Earth characters aren't as interesting. This film also has a good soundtrack to it. Overall a pretty good film.7.0/10,7,0,0,3 November 2019
Joker," Joker
",Joker Is my most favourite comic book movie of 2019. The performances are amazing! I would be surprised if Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get nominated for an Oscar. The directing and story are great and I really liked the soundtrack. I never got bored watching this film. I can see why some people might not like it but I loved it. This is a win for DC. I hope they do more standalone films like this. This film transcends the genre and doesn't feel like a comic book movie. For some people that might be an issue but for me it works. I would highly recommend this film.9.5/10,10,3,5,31 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Revenge of the Sith
",Revenge of the Sith is the best of the prequel Star Wars trilogy. The CGI is better in this film and so is the plot. The action is the best in this trilogy. The acting and chemistry is still a mixed bag. The film at times drags a bit and there are still times were the CGI is still not that great. Also I found Anakin's turn to the dark side very sudden and the reasons weren't the best in my opinion. Still it is enjoyable.7.0/10,7,0,0,30 November 2019
Wonder Woman," Wonder Woman
",Wonder Woman is a very fun and entertaining film. I thought Gal Gadot was very good in the role and her chemistry with Chris Pine was great. Most of the visuals are good and the action is great. The plot is good and has some very fun moments. I liked the twist with the villain however the final battle is the weakest part of the film. A little generic and the CGI gets quite poor. Other than that a very solid film and at the moment my favourite film in the DCEU.8.7/10,9,6,15,9 November 2019
X-Men: First Class," X-Men First Class
",This was a great way to breathe new life into the franchise. The performance from the two leads are great and their characters are great. The villain is good and the plot is pretty good as well. Some of the new characters aren't as interesting as the original and I didn't like Jennifer Lawrence's Mystique in this. There are plenty of fun scenes even though they don't stand out as much as others in the franchise. Overall a great film.8.5/10,8,0,0,2 November 2019
The Wolverine," The Wolverine
",I actually quite enjoy this film. I like the darker tone and High Jackman gives a great performance. The first two acts are really good and interesting and have some excellent action scenes. The final act lets the movie down by loser some of that darker tone and becoming more run of the mill. Some of the new characters in it are a little bland as well. But overall this is an entertaining film.8.0/10,8,1,1,2 November 2019
Black Panther," Black Panther
",Black Panther is another great film out of the MCU. the cast is great and this film has one of the best villains in the MCU. it has a good plot and the action is really good and fun until the end. Some of the the visuals are good. The CGI takes a dip in quality in the final battle and the villain becomes a evil version of the hero. But the villain's send of was nice although they probably could have kept him on for more films. Overall another fun movie.8.6/10,9,1,3,3 November 2019
Iron Man," Iron Man
","Iron Man is terrific start to the MCU. Robert Downy Jr is perfect in the role. This film I find gets better each time I watch it. It has a good plot and even though the villain is great, I still enjoy him. The action is exciting and the effects are really good. Overall this is a fun and exciting start to the MCU.8.9/10",9,0,1,2 November 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Batman v Superman
","Batman v Superman is entertaining but a mess. Ben Affleck I thought was great as Batman. I didn't like the villain in this. Batman had good reasons for not liking Superman but Superbad no reason to be against Batman. This move has many plots and some of the CGI isn't good. The actual fight between the two was very short and while entertaining it weird to think that in Man of Steel Superman was fight another power person and punching each other into buildings, but here Batman is hitting Superman with a sink. And the way the fight ended was really stupid. And the final act with Doomsday was too much. If you want to watch Batman it's a good movie but it is a mess.5.0/10",5,2,4,9 November 2019
Casino Royale," Casino Royale
","Casino Royale is the first Daniel Craig Bond film. This was a great way to reboot the franchise. It was dark and gritty and it was nice to see Bond as a brand new 00 agent who is much more reckless. Daniel Craig is great as Bond is my person favourite Bond. The villain and plot are great. The Bond girl is one of the best. The action in this is terrific, every action scene was done brilliantly. The poker scene is actually really good to watch. It could have been very boring but it's not. The film does get a little slow after the poker but it has a very good payoff in the final act. Definitely one of the best bonds.9.3/10",9,2,5,2 November 2019
X2: X-Men United," X2
","X2 takes what the first film did and improves upon it. The story is very interesting and it's cool to see the heroes and the villain from the last film working together. This film is also darker then that first which I liked. There is more action, with the Wolverine in the school scene being a standout. The cast is really good again and there are some great new additions. Night crawler was probably my most favourite new addition. The villain was quite good as well. X2 is an example of how a sequel can be better then it's predecessor.8.9/10",9,3,3,2 November 2019
Thor: The Dark World," Thor the Dark World
",Thor the Dark World is a pretty forgettable movie. There is some good action and acting. But there earth scenes aren't interesting and Natalie Portman doesn't seem interested in the film. The plot is forgettable and the villain might be the worst in the entire MCU. Loki is great again and the scenes with him and Thor are good. Overall and average movie.6.5/10,6,0,0,3 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Force Awakens
","The Force Awakens was a fun return to the franchise. It is very similar to a New Hope which is unfortunate but the benefit of that is it felt much more like the Star Wars we know and love unlike the prequel films. The new cast is good, but it was great to see the old cast back. Especially Han. My biggest complaint is that Rey could beat Kylo Ren in a lightsaber duel without any training. That was a big misstep. Other then that it's a very entertaining film.8.4/10",8,2,14,30 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A New Hope
",Star Wars a New Hope is a fun space adventure. Darth Vader is an iconic villain and Luke is and iconic hero. The whole cast and characters are great. It is fun and exciting. This was a great introduction to an amazing universe and the start of fantastic story. I loved the interaction between R2D2 and C3PO. The films is and instant classic.9.1/10,9,0,0,30 November 2019
Deadpool," Deadpool
",Deadpool is an hilarious movie did the character and Ryan Reynolds justice after X-Men Origins Wolverine. The cast in this is perfect and the movie is hilarious. The action is fun and the plot is very good for this movie. The R rating really works for this film. My only complaint with this film is that the villain is pretty bland and run of the mill. Other than that this is a great film.9.2/10,9,0,2,2 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Empire Strikes Back
",This is in my opinion the best Star Wars movie yet. It improves upon the first movie and has the one of the best plot twist of all time. Luke's Story in this is great and Yoda is a lot of fun. Darth Vader is an even better villain in this film. This film is fun and exciting from beginning to end. It never gets slow and is fast passed. This is an amazing film.9.5/10,10,1,1,30 November 2019
Spectre," Spectre
","Spectre is the fourth Daniel Craig Bond film. I personally really enjoyed spectre, I thought it was underrated. It's not on the same level as Skyfall but it doesn't have to be. The opening sequence with the helicopter fight is one of the best openings in the franchise. Many of the action scenes are some of the best in my opinion. Daniel Craig is great and funny at times. The Bond girl is pretty good. I enjoy the plot how the villain was a little underwhelming. He didn't get to do a whole lot and the twist was a little much. The final act felt a little rushed compared to the first 2. Overall I have a great time watching spectre.8.0/10",8,1,1,2 November 2019
The Bourne Supremacy," The Bourne Supremacy
",The Bourne Supremacy is a great sequel to The Bourne Identity. Matt Damon is back and is great. The new characters are really good and add new depth to the franchise. The action I thought was great except for one fight were at times is was a little difficult to see what was going on. In my opinion this film is actually a little better then Identity. It is faster passed and has a great ending were Bourne confronts the daughter of two people he has killed and admits to doing it. That was very well done. Overall a very exciting and fast passed movie.9.0/10,9,0,0,2 November 2019
