The Blair Witch Project," Awful!
","How anyone could find this film scary is beyond me.  What this film was - just downright boring.  I had trouble keeping my eyes open while it was on the screen, plus it made me dizzy.  I was not alone in my opinion because when the film came to a conclusion, the audience booed!  I saw it at a special screening, so thank God I didn't put down any money to see it!",1,1,3,20 September 1999
Casablanca," You can't get better than this!
","If one film represents the studios of Warner Brothers, and if one film represents the 1940's - it's 'Casablanca.'  This is a film that can be seen time and time again, you always see something new.  Most films become a time capsule for their era, this film transcends all periods.  Brilliantly staged, filmed, and performed.  This film will live forever.",10,0,0,26 October 1998
Amistad," Powerful!
","Powerful film from the Cecil B. DeMille of our generation, Steven Spielberg. Matthew McConaughey is the only weak spot in the film.  It's not his fault, however, the part is badly written.",7,2,6,30 November 1998
10 Things I Hate About You," Charming!
","My teenage daughter wanted to see this film, so I took her even though I had no desire to see it.  What a surprise!  I thoroughly enjoyed it and thought the film was very charming.  Note:  When the ending credits roll, stay for the end because they show some amusing 'out-takes.'  Most of the audience had left at this point and they missed some fun!",7,0,0,6 April 1999
American Pie," I admit it, I thought it was funny.
","As a parent of two teenagers, I would like to be appalled by what I saw in AMERICAN PIE.  But hey, I was once a teenager too, and this generation is just as horny as my generation.  We all faced similar situations.  So relax, watch, and laugh.  You may not agree or like what you are seeing, but I guarantee, you will laugh!",5,0,1,12 July 1999
Doctor Zhivago," One of my all-time favorite films!
","One of my all-time favorite films!  So having said that, let me tell you what I find wrong with it.  First of all, no one in the film looks remotely Russian.  Plus, the film was made in 1964 and all the women look like 1964, especially Julie Christie with her bouffant hair, false eye-lashes and white lipstick!",9,0,1,22 January 1999
Gone with the Wind," Why not Franchot Tone?
","My only criticism of this, my all-time favorite film, is the casting of Leslie Howard as Ashley Wilkes.  In the book, Ashley is 28 when the story begins (and Leslie Howard was then pushing 40).  Franchot Tone would had been perfect and just the right age.  Why was he never considered?  Also, wouldn't it had been great if Elizabeth Taylor had been cast as Bonnie Blue? She too was EXACTLY the right age (seven) and would had been completely believable as the daughter of Vivien Leigh.",Null,1,2,16 October 1998
Some Like It Hot," You can't get better than this!
","My all-time favorite comedy, you just can't get better than this!  Director Billy Wilder pulled off a miracle when he took a basic burlesque sketch and made it into a non-stop feature length comedy classic.  My only complaint is that he chose not to film it in color.",10,1,2,30 December 1998
The Wedding Singer," Decency wins out!
","It was refreshing to see a comedy about a decent guy who all he wants out of life is to meet the right girl, fall in love and get married.  I don't care what anyone says, Adam Sandler has great screen charisma and is cute as he can be.  He and Drew Barrymore made a charming screen couple.",5,1,2,28 December 1998
