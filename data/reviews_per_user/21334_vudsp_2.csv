3:10 to Yuma," The Original is better
","In the original 310 to Yuma to story is straight and pure and the ending has is good. However in the remake, the ending is confusing.In the original the wife comes to see her husband off. Rains and the tracks are double track and the buildings are made of mud not hard roads etc and the contention town and the saloon are quite natural The sex in the saloon is better in the original than in the remake In the remake the associates of Russel Crowe are sincere and in the last portion of the film Russel crow kills his trustee who did no wrong in saving him. It looks bit odd and the ending leaves a bad tasteAnyway a nice movie is remade",6,0,0,25 December 2013
Zootopia," Made me to remember the novel ANIMAL FARM by George Orwell
","Animal Farm is an allegorical and dystopian novella by George Orwell, first published in England on 17 August 1945. After 70 years we get a nice movie well written and allegorical commenting on the two legged animals we see every day.Though the movie gives a solution to the animal behavior, we are yet to see any solution to the daily killings of human beings - mammals too - by human beings in the name of religion race and what not.Its difficult to find the solution for the whole earth as different type of specimens live in different parts of the world and its very difficult to have a single control over these animals",9,9,17,29 May 2016
