The Lobster," Another pretentious crap by Yorgos Lanthimos.
","I have watched 'The Lobster' after watching 'The Killing of A sacred deer', and I must say 'The Lobster' is much worse.Yorgos Lanthimos probably is addicted to making pretentious, overly-symbolic movies and yet he forgets that a good movie is not made of symbols or weird movie scripts, but of good character development, good cinematography and a decent movie duration.Here, we don't have any of these 3 items. Character development is one of the poorest I have ever seen in a movie. The way actors speak make they look like robots. I am pretty sure Lanthimos wanted this to happen on purpose to make the movies look 'quirkier' , but it only makes the movie boring and insufferable to watch. Léa Seydoux's and Rachel Weisz's ridiculously amateurish performances made me want to punch them in their faces. I swear, they are worse than amateur actors having drama classes in high school. Colin Farrell makes the movie more palatable, giving a very natural and humble performance, but he cannot save the movie, because once again, HIS CHARACTER IS NOT DEVELOPED. We cannot give a damn about anything about him. We don't care. Lanthimos creates characters we don't care about.Regarding cinematography, mediocre at most. Though photography is okay, the soundtrack kills the movie. I was almost going insane with all those cellos, being repetitively played in every scene. Enough is enough. Also, the movie is too long for a mediocre story. Yes, the story is mediocre and disappointing. I was mildly interested during the first half at the hotel - which seemed to be a parody of our sick and disturbed society, but after the main character leaves the hotel and goes to woods, the movie becomes a poorly developed crappy love story. What a pretentious and boring movie. Like I said about 'The Killing of a sacred deer', Lanthimos thinks his movies are better than they really are. He probably thinks he's the next Kubrick but he's definitely not him.",6,0,2,17 December 2017
A Star Is Born," Definitely the worst 'A Star is Born' remake
","I dare to differ from the bandwagon here. Bradley Cooper's debut as a director is okay, but nothing beyond that.This is undoubtedly an unremarkable movie, and perhaps the weakest of all ASIB remakes. The first mistake Bradley made was to remake a remake. And if he was trying to do something new, he didn't accomplish the mission.Cooper's ASIB looks and feels like a movie made for TV. Pace is absurdly slow, cinematography is as basic as it gets and the acting of both Bradley and Gaga is mediocre and I honestly cannot understand the buzz over them, especially when it comes to Gaga.I can acknowledge that she wasn't terrible as Ally but she wasn't brilliant, either. In all honesty, playing a singer with an unique nose is not something out of Gaga's comfort zone. And the basic, underwhelming plot kept Gaga locked in that comfort zone. I didn't see one single scene (not even the so much talked about bathtub scene) that made Gaga work hard or use her so-called acting skills. Everything was dramatically easy there. If there really is a brilliant actress inside Gaga, this role didn't enable her to show it to the audience.Cooper's performance is way better than Gaga's - and his character, dramatically speaking, is much harder to be played - but unfortunately, he is not getting much appraisal while Gaga is getting nominations that to me are not justified. I honestly think that people are mistaking Gaga the actress for Gaga the singer and judging her acting skills (?) based on her singing skills.Regarding the songs, by the way, the only one that is not that bad is Shallow, but any vocal coach would agree that those high notes in the chorus are definitely not Gaga's comfort zone and she shows it. She is almost screaming in the chorus and the rest of the songs are just a pop pastiche that you don't want to listen at home. And to think that the latest remake had the greatest singer alive, Barbra Streisand!Anyway, this is to me a movie that won't be remembered in the next 10 years. I am pretty sure Bradley Cooper has a lot potential as a director, but he has to keep working on that and maybe cast better actresses for his movies.",1,16,28,27 January 2019
Passengers," A great movie about life choices and moral dilemmas
","Critics are bashing this movie because apparently they did not understand the purpose of this movie. THIS IS NOT SCI-FI. If you're expecting a SCI-FI movie, or something similar to 'Gravity', forget it. THIS IS NOT SCI-FI. This is not a movie about the adventure of being in spaceActually, this is a PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER/DRAMA that happens in space. And for being a psychological thriller, it's actually a wonderful movie. If you happened to enjoy 'Moon' featuring Sam Rockwell, you'll definitely like this one. Jennifer Lawrence's performances usually annoy me a little for being a little prepotent, but in 'Passengers' she brings a leap of fresh air with her natural, unpretentious acting. You can see she matured a lot and her acting has improved by leaps and bounds, and she's no longer annoying like she used to be, she's growing into a great actress right now. I was also very positively surprised by Chris Pratt's performance. I have always seen the potential he had to be a great actor apart from being mostly a action movie stud. But in this movie, his acting skills are shown, and they don't disappoint. His emotions are natural and visceral, his acting is mature and convincing, and, in my opinion, deserves an Academy Award nomination. You can see he clearly worked very hard to play this character, and he deserves recognition for that. Unfortunately, I think this movie will be ignored by the Academy, since the Academy follows a lot the rules of the critics. The cinematography of the movie is superb, with beautiful love scenes between Lawrence and Pratt. Also, Michael Sheen and Laurence Fishburne surprises with their adorable, great, essential cameos, like cherries on the top of a sundae. This is not a light-hearted movie, or an action movie about life in space. This is a movie about moral dilemmas, life choices, loving and being loved, and, most of all, forgiveness. The ending, which was actually unexpected in a way, made me smile and pity the characters a little at the same time, for being so innocent, such dreamers. This is a beautiful movie, that goes deep into our emotions, and if you have ever had a dream or loved someone, you'll understand its deepness and meaning.",8,5,9,3 January 2017
Us," Another case of 'The Emperor's New Clothes' by Jordan Peele
","I guess Jordan Peele's 'horror' is not for me. First, it's not horror, because it's not scary - well it's only scary if you find movies like 'Scream' or 'Scary Movie' scary. All the horror clichÃ©s are there. Some very cringe worthy comical moments with jokes that weren't funny. Plus, there is no character development. No character development at all. Only a solid first act, then followed by very disappointing second and third acts, with killings and more killings and a predictable 'plot twist' I could guess right during the first 15 minutes of the movie. The concept of the movie is nice, cinematography is also nice combined with the soundtrack but these technical aspects don't save a plot that is very simplistic, with a terrible self-explanatory and predictable conclusion. Lupita's amazing acting is the only good thing in it.Now that I have watched the second movie by Jordan Peele I can say that his movies are basically acclaimed by the critics and they are as disappointing as they are overhyped. Don't believe the hype.",1,76,135,21 March 2019
"I, Tonya"," This is a movie about a bidimensional, white trash ice skater - not Tonya Harding.
","I finally have watched this movie and I can say I am deeply disappointed. I, as a big fan of figure ice skating was really thrilled about this movie and expected much more. If you don't know much about Tonya Harding's story, I suggest you read about her and watch some of her old and new interviews and you'll understand why I didn't like the movie. One of the reasons is its screen script. There is no 'official story' about what happened to Tonya Harding or Nancy Kerrigan. The script was written based on interviews with Tonya and her ex-husband, carried on by the screen writer himself. So, much of what is told in the movie is purely fictional, especially the parts about her mother, since she never agreed to talk to the screen writer or the production staff. Tonya herself said some parts of the movie were inaccurate, and Margot Robbie said that when she first read the script she thought it was about a fictional figure skater, not Tonya Harding. Besides, many things in this movie remain unexplained. The movie is basically about the verbal, physical and moral abuse Tonya endured throughout her life, but shows too little how Tonya built her athletic and ice skating career. And regarding the Nancy Kerrigan controversy, there isn't much talked about, either. Nancy is just a shadow in this movie, there's nothing about her point of view or how the incident actually affected her or her career. In the end you feel that you don't really know what the life of Tonya Harding the ice skater was really like.Regarding the direction, I found really tasteless Gillespie's attempt to give a comical tone in the NUMEROUS domestic violence scenes of the movie. The characters break the 4th wall to give the violent scenes a more 'casual' look (because according to Gillespie, Tonya talks about her violent past in a very casual manner), but cinematographically this 'casual tone' didn't work - it only makes it look like the movie romanticizes abuse and underestimates its impact on a woman's life. Also, the whole sarcastic/comical tone of the movie made it feel superficial, boring and childish. To me, a more serious approach to Tonya's life would be more appropriate. And regarding Margot Robbie's performance, I found it very disappointing and amateurish. Regardless the fact that she's not as bulky or athletic as the real Tonya, she played a white trash, foul-mouthed Tonya Harding that never existed. Her interpretation of a redneck is purely stereotypical. Also, I don't know where Robbie's accent came from, since real-life Tonya doesn't have that strong southern accent - she's from Portland, come on! It's an annoying accent that appears and disappears throughout the movie, alongside with the numerous bad words (some of them included by Robbie herself) and a very artificial, rude way to talk that Harding didn't have. Robbie didn't convince me and made me feel NOTHING for her character. On the other side, Allison Janney is BRILLIANT as Tonya's mother. She could flawless play a sociopath, and truly deserves at least an Oscar nomination as a supporting actress. Another good surprise in this movie is Paul Walter Hauser's acting. To sum it all up, this is a mediocre movie, that didn't entertain me (how am I supposed to find funny a story with so much domestic violence?), and didn't move me. It also barely tells who in fact Tonya Harding was. It is a superficial, bidimensional portrait of a woman who's surely much more complex than what was shown in the movie.",6,47,101,26 December 2017
Bohemian Rhapsody," A movie that had potential but looks and feels like a boring TV biopic
","Amid the controversy regarding Bryan Singer and the scandals he's involved, I will try to stay away from the accusations to give my most neutral review on Bohemian Rhapsody.I have never been a huge fan of Singer's work - his best work was definitely 'The Usual Suspects' with its non-linear narrative, but after that he's basically specialized himself in directing superhero and action movies, that basically rely on boring and linear narratives, so I think he's lost the ability to shoot an interesting movie again. I honestly don't understand the hype of Bohemian Rhapsody, and I really think people are mistaking their love for Queen with the love for this movie.Bohemian Rhapsody unfortunately commits this sin - its linear, predictable narrative makes the movie boring, looking almost like a TV biopic. Freddie Mercury's story is summarized in a very reckless way - parts that could have been shown (such as the years when Freddie lived in Munich, Germany and worked a lot with David Bowie) or more properly developed (the creation of Bohemian Rhapsody, Freddie's relationship with Paul and Mary, Freddie's bohemian parties and lush lifestyle, etc) were basically ignored or portrayed in a very flat, emotionless way. Not even the part where Freddie finds out he's got AIDS was touching - it look amateurish, bland, just like something from a cheap TV biopic.Those who haven't read or known more about Freddie Mercury will never feel, by solely watching this movie, what a larger-than-life figure Freddie was. He had a very strong, flamboyant personality, with a lifestyle that matched his epic attitude - and the movie fails to show that. Here, Freddie is just a lead singer - a very talented one, by the way - and nothing else. A talented singer with no soul - that's what the movie shows, and that's nothing close to what the real Freddie Mercury was. I also question the need to reenact the Live Aid concert - we can watch the original performance on YouTube at any time, why the need to make actors reenact it? Those were several minutes wasted in the movie, minutes that could have been used developing better other parts and elements of Freddie's life and personality. I honestly think the movie would have ended in a better and more interesting way with the following final scene - Freddie steps on the stage at the Live Aid concert and sees the enormous audience praising him, sits by the piano and starts playing Bohemian Rhapsody. At the first notes, screen goes black and the credits begin with the song in the background.Casting wise, I wish a stronger-looking actor was cast to play Freddie - though Rami Malek did a great job in a disappointing movie, physically speaking he doesn't send off the strength and physical charisma that Freddie had. I have to praise Rami for being the only interesting element that made me keep watching this movie - though I still think he wasn't the best choice for the part and his teeth were absurdly exaggerated (which kind of annoyed me) - I have to acknowledge that he did his best with a poorly written character in a poorly written plot - he studied very well Freddie's gestures and could imitate them perfectly, his acting was decent and his presence is undeniable.Unfortunately, this is a movie that had a lot of potential, but that fell flat into a boring narrative, weak plot and a very summarized biopic of Freddie Mercury. It's a pity that Bryan Singer didn't use the flamboyant personality of Freddie Mercury as an inspiration to shoot a more poetic, artistic movie with more daring shots and visual elements that unfortunately were absent in this work.",5,2,3,29 January 2019
The Favourite," A pretentious, cliché-filled, dull love triangle disguised as a portrait of the British Royalty
","Once again, Yorgos Lanthimos disappoints me. Before you vote my review as an unhelpful, lemme explain myself. Perhaps I have an issue with his movies, because I have never enjoyed any of his work, and this movie, unfortunately, is no exception.Because of the hype and the multiple Oscar nominations, I had high expectations of it, but none of them were fulfilled. Here we have the story of Queen Ann (Olivia Colman) and two women who lived with her - Lady Marlborough (Rachel Weisz) and Abigail (Emma Stone). Be warned - there is no plot in the movie, only a lesbian love triangle among the 3 lead characters. At one point Abigail, who was nothing more than a servant of the palace, realizes that Lady Marlborough is the Queen's favorite for being her lover, so Abigail decides to give the Queen some love as well. Expect awkward, irksome scenes of oral sex between swollen, scab-covered legs - at this point, the audience should know 'irksome' is Lanthimos's comfort zone. There's some childish jealousy when Abigail tries to poison Lady Marlborough and some even more childish melodrama when the Queen misses Lady Marlborough's touch and vice-versa. And a lot of rabbits. And that's it, and I am not exaggerating.Of course, the movie has basically zero character development. We know all characters are flawed and do horrible things - like all characters in Lanthimos's movies do - but we don't know why they do these things, what happened to them in their lives to make them do what they do - and that's called character development, which lacks in this movie in a very blatant way. And to make matters worse, here we have the cliché-filled portrayal of a royal figure (the Queen) as a weak, gullible, laughable figure who is easily manipulated by servants and maids who seem to be smarter than Her Highness herself. Expect also the cliché scenes of the nobility in decadent parties , displaying deplorable habits. Yawn. As if we hadn't seen this is so many movies before.Cinematography wise, I got tired, exhausted of the poorly-illuminated scenes and the fish eye camera. It made everything claustrophobic, which seems an useless strategy in this movie, because there was nothing shocking or claustrophobic going on, just a boring love triangle and a woman with bandages around her legs. The only remarkable elements in this movie, in my opinion are:<ul><li>Olivia's acting - Olivia Colman is unrecognizable as Queen Ann, in a very good way; (Rachel Weisz did nothing incredible here, her role was 0% risky dramatically speaking. Emma Stone had a more difficult role but once again she still displayed the same mannerisms she showed in 'Easy A', 'Lala Land' and almost every movie in which she acts - exaggerated, unconvincing, trying-too-hard gestures and expressions).</li><li>Costume design;</li><li>Art direction - decent artistic portrayal of the English Royalty during late 17th/early 18th century.</li></ul>Unfortunately, this movie, which has probably cost a lot of money considering its production, art direction and costume design, was a waste of budget - such a beautiful ambiance fell flat into a boring, empty plot. This is movie is not either enlightening nor shocking, neither incisive or witty, it's just a boring love triangle with very disturbing characters disguised as some 'fun criticism' of the nobility and the high class.",6,89,159,13 February 2019
Mr. Nobody," An empty, simplistic way to talk about free will and its consequences.
","I have taken a long time to watch this movie. I have only watched it because it appeared in many lists as a movie with a 'mindblowing' ending. If I knew how disappointing this would be, I would have never watched. These were 2 and a half hours that I will never get back. The movie basically talks about the choices we make in life and the consequences behind every choice. The main character, played by Jared Leto, is different from everybody else for knowing beforehand the consequences of every choice he'd make in life. And this is the plot. The end.There is nothing, nothing with one slightly deep, philosophical meaning in this movie. This may seem great to those who are not used to watching movies, but anyone who has watched a good amount of movies and is familiarized with philosophy will see how empty and even childish this movie is. Jared Leto and Diane Kruger give us solid performances, and cinematography and soundtrack are decent. But good cast and cinematography do not a good movie make. The plot is too weak and simplistic to make a meaningful, remarkable movie. Moreover, it is unnecessarily long. 40 minutes would be enough to tell everything. The director used a non-linear timeline to make the audience THINK this is a good movie. But it isn't. It's pretentious to say the least. If you're an experienced movie watcher, you'll probably recognize the many flaws of this movie.",5,1,1,14 August 2018
La La Land," Overrated romantic comedy with boring references to Old Hollywood
","This movie is overrated to say the least.Because of the reception it had among critics and the amount of Golden Globe Awards and Academy Awards nominations it got, I thought this would be genius work, a true masterpiece.That's not exactly what this movie is.First, Emma Stone doesn't deserve best actress nomination. She can't act if her life depends on it, has no charisma, no presence, and in this movie she has the same mannerisms she had in that stupid teen movie 'Easy A'. No effort at all.Ryan Gosling deserves the nomination, but definitely does not deserve the award. Though his performance is convincing and pleasant, it's not amazing enough to be awarded with an Oscar. That being said (spoiler alert), the plot is basically this: girl meets guy. They fall in love. Girl wants to be a famous actress. Guy wants to have a jazz bar. They both make bad professional choices in life, which eventually make them fall apart. Years later, girl is already a famous actress, married, and meets the guy in the jazz bar he founded (boring Casablanca reference, anyone?). She obviously does not stay with him and the ending implies that they never saw each other again. The end. Basically, this is the plot in a nutshell. Now add some cringeworthy dancing and singing scenes, some attempts to dance jazz and a vintage costume design and you'll have what's called by most deluded critics 'a masterpiece'. Don't waste your time watching this.",4,9,14,26 January 2017
Platoon," A masterpiece with timeless philosophical meaning
","I don't know how I've lived without this movie until today. It was released the year I was born and it spoke to me as if it was fresh and new. This is definitely Oliver Stone's masterpiece, and my respect for the director only increased right now.In Platoon, we not only see the horrors of the Vietnam war - we see a brutal and honest portrait of the many war crimes the American army committed, how millions of Vietnamese civilians were murdered, how entire millenarian villages were decimated and how, in the end, this is one of the most ignorant, gratuitous, unwarranted and pathetic wars of all times - aren't them all?But although all these facts already make Platoon one of the greatest movies of all times, surprisingly, they are not what make it a masterpiece. The real geniality in Platoon is to raise philosophical questions about the relevance of war and the duality of humankind - with its flawlessly constructed and complex characters, we see that nobody is entirely bad or good, and we also see that sometimes morally condemned acts will be justified by opportunists as an 'unnecessary evil'.Technically speaking, the movie is impeccable. A 2-hour-long war movie that feels like it lasts only 30 minutes, because tension and action is maintained at their peak the whole time, and you don't want to blink to miss anything. Edition is something to be acclaimed as well, because the war scenes were absurdly difficult to be filmed and yet in a multidimensional environment which is a battle camp scene where everything happens simultaneously they managed to show everything that was happening without confounding the audience - all scenes were explicit, clear and understandable. Everything had a point or a reason to be shown.Needless to say, this is the quintessential Willem Dafoe movie. I have always thought he is one of the greatest actors of all times and he's terrible underrated. I now am very sorry for the fact he didn't win any relevant award for this performance - few actors could deliver the emotion and the charisma he delivered only with his eyes and his body language. I have to say the same thing about Tom Berenger - that acting was the work of genius - and yet both Tom and Willem were nominated for an Academy Award and neither of them won, in the year when Platoon won for Best Picture. Charlie Sheen and Forest Whitaker also shone as well - it's absurdly refreshing to, every once in a while, to watch a movie in which the ENTIRE CAST can actually ACT and do a great job.As if this movie didn't have enough qualities, cinematography is another undeniable quality of this capolavoro - the green palette in the entire movie highlights the blood and the human expressions amid the horrors of war - and beautiful and iconic scenes (such as the one portrayed in the movie poster) were filmed in such a gorgeous way that they will certainly be in my mind forever. I have never seen aerial shots done so masterfully like I did here.Platoon is neither a horror show or a gruesome war movie - you won't see a blood battle here, though the battle scenes are relevant. The point of the movie is, fortunately, not to shock the audience with blood or mutilated limbs - the aim of this work is to startle us with the horrors of human nature - and how apparently normal people can hide monsters that will be only released in the right conditions.There were scenes halfway into this movie that made me cry in desperation and lose my breath like any other movie could. To think that events like that happened in real life only made me feel even more miserable and question how exactly humankind evolved throughout the years. Are we really civilized? Are we actually becoming a better species? Oliver Stone, with his brilliant plot and direction, created a masterpiece who will be imprinted in our minds not only as the portrait of one of most terrifying genocides of all times - his work will resonate as the fire that stirs philosophical questionings about the true meaning of life, humanity and morality. Unfortunately, when we watch this work of genius we realize the world hasn't changed much since then. That says a lot about what kind of humans we've become. That proves how relevant this movie is today - and it has impressed my mind and heart like only very few movies could.May God bless the souls of whoever died in those very dark times.",10,3,4,10 March 2019
Life," Shocking, beautiful, philosophical sci-fi journey!
","This movie is amazing. I really do not understand the bad reception of it. I guess many critics didn't like it because this is one of the few sci-fi movies that has a very depressing, catastrophic ending - which, in my opinion, is exactly what makes this movie so clever, credible and remarkable. Here the viewer is confronted with ethical dilemmas regarding researches of extraterrestrial life - how far science can get? Are we allowed to play God?In this movie, when astronauts find out that there is indeed extraterrestrial life, they start to explore the new alien cell inside their spaceship. That's when things go terribly wrong, and the new discovered creature displays an out-of-control behavior. After that, astronauts do not only fight for their lives, but have to deal with the catastrophic consequences of their own acts, the desperation of eminent death, and the conclusion that human lives are much weaker than we thought. Cast is amazing and once again Jake Gyllenhaal's performance doesn't disappoint. I also congratulate Ryan Reynolds and Ariyon Bakare for their amazing work in this movie. There are bloody scenes that can make our stomachs churn, but in a good way - and the actors work very well to create the tragic atmosphere of the movie.The ending could not be more nihilistic, cruel and catastrophic. Humankind is faced with its own decay, and only the brave can appreciate such kind of movie. A clever, daring, unique sci-fi masterpiece that got me thinking and wondering about it for a few weeks after watching it.",9,2,7,7 August 2017
Deadpool," Overrated, childish, boring, raunchy - and not funny.
","I don't care about the amount of raunchy jokes and profanity in the movie. I do care that the movie is not funny at all. You can be both raunchy and funny, but this didn't happen in Deadpool.Ryan Reynold's performances are usually laughable, but here it reaches the level of pity. I pity the fact that he accepted to act in such crappy movie. It feels like something a dumb teeanger would watch. A very dumb one.If you don't wanna waste your time, don't watch it. It's definitely not worth it. I guess the overhype around everything about this movie is a circlejerk mess. Definitely the worst movie of 2016.",1,30,60,27 December 2016
