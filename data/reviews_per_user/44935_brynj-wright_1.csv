Casablanca," Timeless classic, great plot, great cast, so many quotes!!
","With a superb supporting cast and a great plot you overlook the small blemishes on this classic movie. It has a timeless quality that makes the film watchable even though you may know the plot and some of the dialogue off by heart. Claude Raines, Peter Lorre and Sidney Greenstreet are wonderful in their supporting roles but the performances of Bergman and Bogart lift this film to the very top of cinematic excellence.",10,1,1,10 June 2003
