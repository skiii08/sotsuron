Angels & Demons," Good entertainer..!!
","The movie is good.I have read the book and i like the movie too, because i went to the movie hall with a mind set that no one can reproduce a complete novel to a movie and i wanted to see how brilliantly the director has handled it. I was happy with the way the story has been shown and i really doubt if it can be done in any better way. But I missed the X-33 in the movie, they could have included that in it. I was expecting to see more CERN parts in the movie, but it was very less. Of course, they can not show more of it as the main story totally in the Vatican City and they shown it beautifully.Good work. I'll give 8.5/10 for this movie.",8,1,4,29 May 2009
