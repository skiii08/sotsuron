Scarface," The F Word
","I have to laugh at the dramatic immaturity (and Americanism) of some reviewers of this film who actually made an effort to count 'the F word'. I really am beginning to think that any movie review forum that tolerates comments like this is best avoided - as are countries where such mind-sets are tolerated.But now onto the movie. Shown on TV recently in a much abridged version, with most of the violence (and not, for once as is the prudish American way, the sex) being cut out, I was impressed with the deep story-telling ability of this movie. Credit it to Brian, or to Oliver, or to Al for a magnificent performance, but the style, the pace, and the quality of this movie all differ dramatically from anything we have up at the cinema today. Most recently seen here was LOTR which is rightfully claimed as a great movie - and yet Scarface, ironically and almost ridiculously, has more of the Tolkien feel and tempo than Jackson's excellent epic.Is Al Pacino, grandson of people from Corleone, a city that is really feared by Italians everywhere, one of the greatest actors who have ever lived? You watch this movie and decide.",Null,0,0,11 January 2002
Walk the Line," It's All Reese
","They say Reese is the best paid actress in movies today. After making this movie for sure. And after seeing this movie it's understandable.It's no exaggeration that she carries the entire flick. Look at her awards here at the IMDb and see just what she picked up - a zillion gajillion. And it's very much deserved.I've never been a fan of Johnny Cash or known much about him and after seeing the film I'm fairly sure I never will be either. His was a twisted sad existence and if the movie is accurate, it's only the bubbly Reese/Carter who gave him respite.Phoenix and Witherspoon supposedly sing and play all their songs but in at least one case this is improbable. Whatever.",Null,1,6,30 November 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Critics Don't Know Squat
","I'd heard all the hype and read all the bad reviews and was totally prepared for the worst. And thus rather surprised at what I saw.Critics don't know squat, and I doubt I will ever read or trust one again. If have a funny feeling that those who claimed the new movie didn't measure up to the old ones were in the forefront of the criticism of the old ones too, and are only now trying to get on the bandwagon.Perhaps the best summary of this movie was the 'report' rather than the 'review' in Time Magazine. Lucas has taken movie making further, and I wouldn't be surprised if it takes another five to ten years to realize what he has really done here.P.S. Time says there is only one scene totally without special effects. We seemed to see two. Clue: think 'Tom Jones'.",Null,0,2,29 August 1999
50 First Dates," Winging It
","Of screenwriter George Wing the IMDb report that he spends months of outlining, telling his story to anyone who will listen, before actually writing anything. One wonders what kind of people Wing had listening and how many they were. One suspects very few and of limited cerebral franchise. One guesses most of these monologues were aimed at cold walls. Add to that the fact that this 'gem' was floating around years before it was picked up and you have something extraordinary, albeit not in a good way.When Sandler's 'almost good' he's just about tolerable, but this is not talent in any sense of the word. Barrymore is sweet and as with The Wedding Singer (which far surpasses this turkey) she makes the movie by setting the tone.No movie can run its full length without one or two gags that work, and this one doesn't fail there either, but as you're watching you're bound to ask yourself how many people wrote this schlock (it was only one) and how little contact they had with one another throughout the writing process and why oh why did the studio insist none of the writers be told what the others were writing about?And as for suspension of disbelief - forget it. Any minute now this movie is going to redeem itself, you'll be thinking as you worm your way to the tortuous denouement. But it doesn't.",Null,1,2,20 October 2006
Casablanca," Best Movie Ever Made
","It has to be. Not only is it extremely well made, but it has a story to kill and everything about it has passed into folklore, becoming icons along the way.What is curious about this movie is that it gets stronger for every viewing. I remember when I first saw Casablanca, generally regarded as one of the two greatest movies to ever come out of Hollywood: I appreciated it, but I was not yet ready for the devastating emotional impact it has. But once you are familiar with it you see the care the movie makers have taken, you see what they wanted to accent, and some of these scenes are destined to become part of our collective unconscious, if they are not there already.If you can get the edition with the Lauren Bacall documentary You Must Remember This, all the better.This movie wins hands down, no contest, as the best movie ever made. It is also the best movie experience you will ever have.",Null,0,1,8 June 2001
Minority Report," Mixed Message
","Spielberg wants us to think he has a dark side, so he grabs onto more of the spurious writing of the eternally plagued Philip K Dick. He enlists the help of Tom Cruise, because the latter looks so good doing chase scenes in his Mission Impossible extravaganzas. He rounds up a team of future experts, at a cost only he could absorb, to delineate what the world will look like fifty years hence. He pounds us with nightmare visions of retinal scan-based demographic tracking and advertisement. And he tries unsuccessfully to emulate the cinematography of one Ridley Scott, who made Dick famous twenty years earlier.But Minority Report is ultimately a run-of-the-mill detective story, not film noir. And although some may see a parallel with Sam Spade, most will instead see a very contrived, very predictable plot denouement.Whatever Spielberg wanted to say about the evils of demographic tracking is not known. He does paint this future, but it's doubtful he wants to warn us about it, it's doubtful he's against it and wants to be taken seriously in this movie.One need only look to Cruise's continually displayed Bulgari watch, Cruise's entrance into The GAP, and the fabulously touted Lexus future car (which looks more like a VW Golf driven backwards) to realise that anyone - and especially Spielberg as we've all along suspected - has a price.Add the clumsy music by John Williams and you have a cinema visit which can be thought-provoking and interesting only if you want it to be. The raw material here is innocuous (and insidious) Muzak all the way.",Null,0,0,27 June 2002
Shakespeare in Love," Take Your Breath Away
","Sorry, just got back from seeing this piece, and it took my breath away. There is so much here, and I doubt offhand if I have seen a more magnificent example of cinematic art in my life. The word 'magnificent' comes to mind time and again, found myself whispering it under my breath throughout.The first hour has no lapses, it is ecstatic. Only the pavement under your carriage changes. As the revelations come one after another you are carried into the pathos - and deeper meaning - of the piece.For anyone who has loved with such a passion - fleeting moments no doubt for all - there is a lesson to be learned. Namely that such things do exist, and it is only through one another that we can attain such heights, such metaphysical experiences, and it is thanks to one another that we have such a memory with us forever. For it is truly better to have loved - with such a frenzied passion - and lost than to have never loved at all. As for me - I am happier. It took me only several years to realize how fortunate I am, and not the fortune's fool at all that Will at first fears he will become.",Null,0,0,14 March 1999
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Works on All Levels
","This is masterful entertainment for people of all ages. I didn't take it seriously the first time even though Depp impressed as always. He certainly did get a slew of awards and nominations, including a chance at an Oscar. He was certainly deserving of it.Amazing the concept comes from a theme park. Everything is done right here. Often movies fade as time goes on, but this one moves from strength to strength and builds up to a finale the way it's supposed to be done.I don't like Disney and don't understand anyone who does. So it just doesn't feel good this coming from such a financial - and even political - empire. But it's good fun all around.The soundtrack, made by Zimmer collaborator Klaus Badelt, moves along just like a Zimmer production would. It keeps things going.Masterful entertainment without being profound - and the lasting memory will always be Captain Jack Sparrow. That this one is in the all time top 250 at the IMDb is perhaps too much - but an 8 out of 10 is exactly appropriate: it's that well done.",Null,2,5,3 May 2006
Ed Wood," Cannes & Landau
","If you look twice at the context in which this movie was made, you can't regard it as anything but serious. It's a biopic that may very well have you laughing hysterically. And if you do find your funny bone being tickled, you're not getting the wrong message; you're getting the right one, because this true story told so accurately and meticulously by Tim Burton is really that funny - and tragic.Wood's Plan 9 from Outer Space won the Golden Turkey Award in 1988 as the Worst Movie Ever Made. This is a singular distinction. Many film critics say that amateur film makers would have done a better job. Check the memorable quotes section to see just how bad Wood's scripting was - it's atrocious.Yet Wood is history, and through Plan 9 and especially this movie, possibly as well-known as his idol Orson Welles.The movie itself is done with such care and precision that it can't help but engage you. Depp's Wood is nothing short of fantastic; no one but Parker could have done the Fuller part as well as she did; they're all great.But Martin Landau stands out from the beginning. Landau does more than portray Bela Lugosi: He is Bela Lugosi. The transformation is so complete you forget you're watching an actor and become completely engrossed in this tragic tale. Wood is tragic, and it's about Wood this movie is made, but the personal real life story of the real life Lugosi is almost too horrible to contemplate here. As Landau quips, 'Hollywood chews you up and spits you out.'We watched this tale on video just tonight; I'd seen it once before. And I couldn't get over how incredible Landau was doing the Lugosi part, and blurted out loud 'but that should have been worth at least an Oscar nomination.' How appropriate then for the temporarily clueless yours truly to discover that Landau won a total of 11 (eleven) major awards for best supporting actor, including the Golden Globe and the Oscar.Everything that Ed Wood was not Tim Burton is in this movie. Alexander's screenplay, based on Grey's book, is spot on at every twist and turn. Ed Wood is simply amazing, and its b/w cinematography should not bore you either, but knock you out: this movie is a tribute, as the Golden Turkey Award was, 'to everyone who has ever had a dream, an ambition, and pursued it relentlessly - only to fall flat on their faces.'",Null,0,0,23 September 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Industrial Light Years
","LOTR it isn't. Lucas can't write dialog to save his life, and even with a script doctor AOTC comes off as so corny the audience is given to uncomfortable laughing and giggling. But about three quarters of the way through this awesome roller coaster romp the special effects suddenly get to you and you say, 'ok, this is enough, game over', because it's just too spectacular. There are scenes there where so much is happening, like a video game with real actors, except - except what they're doing here is industrial light years ahead of what anyone else can do.",Null,0,1,17 May 2002
Forrest Gump," The Hype
","The hype said this movie would change you forever. The movie is unique in that it evokes laughter and tears at the same time and you feel both swelling up inside you and you literally honestly really don't know which will win out and come out first.The trivia section for this movie is ripe with clues that some people don't seem to get - but without getting them it's a mystery what people see in the movie. That a song called Blowin' in the Wind was written by Bob Dylan but the performer in the movie uses the stage name Bobbie Dylan - would this scene have any value, make any sense, if we didn't know that? It's clear that to some nuggets like this were pure revelation.As a keeper it's weak. You start to see where the story line is 'just a bit too thin', but this is the second Oscar in a row for Hanks (after Philadelphia) and no offense to the easily offended Hoffman, but this one takes a lot more work and talent than tilting one's head to the side and insisting there are 246 toothpicks on the floor when you really don't have a clue.Was released twice in the same year and cleaned up both times; won six of its possible thirteen Oscars; Hans Zimmer is good and his music was no exception in The Lion King, but it's a shame one can't give awards to all who are deserving: Silvestri's work on this one is some of the best of the past ten years.",Null,1,3,15 October 2004
Léon: The Professional," Comsummate 'Cinematics'
","It was extremely gratifying to see this movie amongst the top 250 at the IMDb. We know it well and viewed it again tonight, and so there were no surprises for us, but this one literally plays like a symphony (and we don't like classical music) with the anticipation growing powerfully with each scene. It is an extremely powerful - and extremely satisfying - cinematic experience, Busson showing clearly here that if he really wants to, and if he's on a winning streak, he has a lot to teach the fat cats in Hollywood.It's extremely violent - extremely - but it's not a 'Sly Stallone throw it in your face look how cool I am' violence. No, the violence here is 'dramatic' - 'tragic'. Besson builds on the contrasts between tender emotions, innocence, and the bile and vile of the earth.Everyone's praised Portman for her work here. Everyone is over the top great. The story itself is magical. But it wasn't until tonight we saw how much detailed meticulous crafting went into this one, how each and every scene was perfectly planned and perfectly filmed, how the story line coordinated with the music - this is undoubtedly one very professional, one very successful attempt at movie-making.You can almost see Besson standing there with an easel and a paintbrush, going over the entire canvas, brushing up every detail until the overall impression is 'perfection'. Not all of Besson's efforts have been as good. After Nikita he probably wanted to make sure he'd never get ripped off again - and so made this one.We don't normally go gaga over Eric Serra's music but in this one he's spot on.Those who have recognised the quality of the art in this movie, despite its overboard violence, have most likely seen the same things we have.One of the best made movies you'll likely ever see.PS. Titles of user comments articles are automatically 'corrected' for spelling. This might seem innocent or even good. The fact that the spell checker used is so severely limited makes matters rather impossible. The title of this article was originally 'Consummate Movie-making'. The word 'moviemaking' passes spell checkers for the UK. The IMDb automatically put an annoying hyphen in - 'movie-making'. Not good.",Null,0,2,22 October 2006

Cold Mountain," Epic Tragic Romance
","Minghella's Cold Mountain is a long one - over two and one half hours - and it delivers on all cylinders. It's a love story cast in the classic 'epic love story' mold.The acting cast are impeccable and impressive: Kidman, Law, Zellwegger, Hoffman, Gammon, Gleeson, Ribisi, Sutherland, Winstone, Baker, Portman - and an assortment of mostly English to round things out.That gives reason to pause: this is a movie about the US civil war with a mostly non-US cast and filmed in Romania. That's reason to pause and ponder.It's an intriguing tale, very bloody at times, and it's not hard to see where it's going, but its obviousness does not deter. It has its requisite 'stacked deck' and it's not hard to see where the final comeuppance there is going to be either.But in movies such as this such comeuppance is not without its price. This might be a love story, but it's also a tragic love story, and so even the scenes the audience long for must be tainted with sorrow.Alison Krauss sings a couple of tunes for the soundtrack, one of which is composed by G Sumner.Kidman is hardly my favourite actress or personality yet she shines here. Although she doesn't have all the classic features, Seale knew how to grasp what she has. If anyone stands out above their colleagues it is Renee who deservedly won an Oscar for her performance. But they're all good. And Law is an excellent counterpoint. And there are so many good anti-war quips in this bloody drama it's not funny.Watch for a punk rocker singing hillbilly tunes.Well made and infinitely more sympathetic than The English Patient from which it seems to derive theme and substance, but is it a keeper? Something to have on the DVD shelf?That's another question entirely. You might appreciate it and enjoy it but it's likely you won't want to buy it.",Null,4,8,10 October 2006
The Patriot," Braveheart USA
","So Rolle's made more than Stargate, ID4, and Godzilla! And it's a nice cast too. Jason Isaacs takes the bad guy to a new level, paralleling Alan Rickman at his sleaziest and putting so much creepiness into the role - a method of portrayal far from what Max von Sydow does for example. Joely Richardson is excellent, as is Heath, as is Tom Wilkinson in a small role. And the music by John Williams, usually horrible, is almost palatable, save for the fact he seems to be plagiarising a lot of Xmas songs.And you might wonder what for all the blood and gore or what it all is supposed to be about, for it surely doesn't make sense on any level, but then you'd be begging the obvious, for in the lead role you have the person who makes it all fall apart.It's just impossible to watch a movie with that creep anymore and come away feeling good and not totally disgusted.",Null,2,5,4 September 2006
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Something About Uncle Arthur
","Uncle Arthur needs to get laid and he gets the assistance of his mates at work. You'd almost expect to see Cameron Diaz as co-producer.Don't miss the outtakes and special features. They're often funnier than the movie itself (alternately not at all as funny).Apatow's wife does a great bit part as Nicky. And watch for her in the deleted scenes. It's Jane Lynch and Seth Rogen (who also co-produces) who have the most chops. A lot of this is evidently ad-libbed with Apatow shouting out possible dialogue to the actors as the cameras roll. There's a lot of humour here and a lot of talent.But if Bill the Bard were called in to do a rewrite, he'd probably start by asking why so much sexual and scatological humour for the mosh pit but nothing for the others paying a shilling for a cushion.And at the end of the day this is a Hollywood film with all that means: shallow, formulaic, and ultimately leaving you feeling the cultural heritage of Tinsel Town is barren.",Null,0,0,3 December 2006
The Usual Suspects," There are only a few
","There are only a few truly original stories of this kind in literature. Two of Agatha Christie's come to mind immediately, and she may be credited even with a third. This screenplay has one of them, and after that 'that's it'. There are no more. And it's actually very hard to be this original: there are only so many ways you can do stuff like this.I remember when I first got this movie (on video, not at the cinema). The guy in the store told me to not get distracted while watching as otherwise I'd miss the plot. And I still kept working at home, watching the movie out of one eye, and I worked a long time that night and rewound the tape several times until I just got plain frustrated and figured I'd better lay off the work and sit this one out. At that point I was halfway through spin #4.So I sat down, away from my work, and watched, and I'd seen enough by then to pick up the pieces pretty quickly - but was no wiser for that, others might want me to add.Until the very very end that is - when suddenly it hit me like a freight train, and I stopped the movie, rewound a bit, checked out a scene or two again, and then uttered something to myself along the lines of '!!!!!!!!', rewound the tape to the beginning, and finally watched the entire movie as had been suggested, and watched very carefully. And when you realize the full portent of the movie, of what you've just seen, you might get up and applaud, right there in front of your own television screen.McQuarrie got a lot of grief for this screenplay. He also got an Oscar, so go figure. But the objection all along from the studio was that the screenplay was too difficult. McQuarrie was adamant and refused to give in, and we have him to thank for that today.",Null,1,4,7 September 2004
The Butterfly Effect," Absurd
","There are those who say this movie has real 'brio' - whatever that's supposed to really mean. The bottom line is that nothing measures up. And although others say one is not supposed to regard this movie as science fiction, this is exactly what it is - what it is supposed to be. And it does win a science fiction award or two. And as for those who so opine, let's just say it's their relatively low IQ coupled with their total lack of understanding that they're so singularly untalented. There are no extra points for being a nerd when it comes to this one.Not to say the movie isn't executed in a professional manner. From the direction to the acting everything is well done with Smart being the outstanding one on screen.But to the story itself. Naturally you're not supposed to understand what's going on initially, and it is this desire to figure out what you're watching that leads you on.And when you finally understand what oversimplified plot prop the writers are using you find yourself blurting out 'ridiculous' over and over again.The difficulty with this one is that it has pretensions of being so much at once - and of course that the writers have a predilection for lots of unsavoury things - so for that matter if you're experiencing an unsettled stomach you might want to try an episode of The Simpsons instead (and it will probably work better as science fiction too).If you're going to get into subtleties like chaos theory then you'd better think through things better. What we imagine, after witnessing this pseudo-piece, is that the writer(s) probably made enough money on the sale of the screenplay to have a blast of an expensive fourteen year birthday party.And that said, we're now on our way to our local convenience store. They have notebooks there and we'll buy one. And no matter people use computers today to jot things down - as do the campus cretins in the movie - we're going to write an entry about on this evening having seen this movie.And then we'll concentrate on the page, and concentrate real hard, and then suddenly everything around us will go a big blur and we'll hear lots of pseudo-impressive 'dts' sounds, and in the end we will never have seen this waste of time at all.",Null,6,12,29 October 2006
Before Sunset," Insult to Injury
","The prequel was bad enough: this is a direct insult. Rick Linklater's not been back to Europe (some would guess from the first movie he only saw it on postcards) and Julie Delphy's contributed most of the dialogue.And dialogue is all you get, dear moviegoer, and if you think for one moment there's something deep and subtle here, maybe you should go on a wild goose chase for the holy grail or UFOs in Nevada. Delphy wrote good dialogue, but the premise of this turkey is tripe, tripe, and more tripe.Endings can always be bad, but Linklater excels at them. And if the first one wasn't bad enough, here he comes spitting in your face with the second. He has one thought on his mind only: $$$. I won't spoil the ending, but let's just say it's an utter crass cynical cop- out with a sole purpose: leave everything open for yet a third movie in this abortive series.And what will they call that? 'Before Sunrise X' as they initially called this one, where 'X' becomes '2' or '3' depending on? Or how about 'Before Noon'?Whatever: it's going to be a turkey too. If you've seen both this and the first, avoid that third one if/when it comes. Don't strike out.",Null,2,4,6 October 2006
Saving Private Ryan," Sorry
","Sorry, but a first viewing leaves me feeling 'totally overrated non-movie.' I didn't like the on-screen format (too low aspect ratio, the *size* of Omaha and Normandy were not there), the initial scenes, which were supposed to be so stark, all this preview 'hype' about veterans freaking out, well I'm sorry if they did, but I didn't see how. Spielberg's psychology was so easy to see, already in the initial moments. Instead of hitting you with a big build up as is done in ordinary scare movies, he just hits you when you're least expecting it - and knowing that, you can read the 'surprises' and the horrors that he's supposed to deliver like an open book. So much for realism.Nor was there much 'vastness' to the D-Day assault. Memories of Ryan's book on screen were much more convincing from that viewpoint at least. Omaha was a terrible disaster - and vast as well, and three Allied boats on screen do not really do the trick.Hanks was excellent, of course, they all were, Sizemore, Damon, who couldn't be drawn into the story, but watching the aftermath a la Schlindler - no, I do not find this kind of story-telling convincing.Several critics have hailed this movie as Spielberg's best ever, I find it hard to agree - although I wouldn't know which movie to pick in its place - as I do not think Spielberg is a real auteur by any stretch of the imagination, or ever could be. He is imminently successful, but his is the 'big shot', the opposite of Ingemar Bergman, who says, 'kill your darlings.' He can film, he can see the 'shot', but he cannot create. Harsh words, and perhaps a bit overdone, but it seems accurate at this moment.Which is not to say I did not enjoy the movie. Of course I did. It was an excellent movie. Well told, accurate depictions for the most part, astounding acting all around - it just wasn't the 'Saving Private Ryan' it was cracked up to be. Its reputation bloated it all out of proportion. It is not Spielberg's best movie (though it may be close), it is not - I firmly believe right now - an Academy Award winner either. Which is a shame for Tom Hanks, who has worked so hard, and been such a convincing actor through so many memorable performances. Perhaps his time - his third Oscar - will yet come.",Null,0,1,21 October 1998
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Famous Last Words
","Yes, I too was duly impressed with The Two Towers. I found it a better film than Fellowship, and still found Fellowship to be a great movie, so my impression of The Two Towers is that it is a great work.It's the second of three, and has not had the advantage Lucas had with The Empire Strikes Back. Potentially it suffers the same fate as Titanic, where everybody knows the outcome.(I was very surprised to hear Jay Leno broadcast that he has never read LoTR - that he has not read it is no surprise, considering who he is; that he should admit this is amazing: He's telling the whole world what they might not already understand about him.)Understanding that it takes jumping through quite a few hoops to pull off makes it all the more interesting to watch, but Jackson's sense for the dramatic is great. There are scenes leading up to Helm's Deep where the editing does it all - scenes that had the public in our theatre wrestling with themselves and their emotions, and there is no way Tolkien himself could have brought out such matters in the book itself.I think the music got a bid grandiose at times, a bit overpowering, but on the whole it was a good score, unlike the 'art' of composers Arnold and especially Williams who have this uncanny ability to totally ruin a movie.Gollum was a major feat. Many have said it's the best CGI ever, and one would be hard put to not agree. It certainly shames ILM thoroughly.Woods' Frodo is still a disappointment. One reviewer in the UK praised Astin for saving the scenes where Woods looks like he's going to make a pass at him. I agree: Woods more or less looks the part, but I don't think we're seeing great acting here. Astin, however, does a remarkable job - he does impress, and much more than in Fellowship.The girls love Orlando Bloom. His is a bit of Errol Flynn. My hero is Viggo, who doesn't have a clean face in 179 minutes. The portrayal of Strider brings home the gritty reality of a story that in book form was cloaked in niceties.The sex angle is mostly lost in the book too, but here we have lots of it, and a possible love triangle as well. This is well done of Jackson in my opinion: LoTR is otherwise too much of a 'guys story', and it makes it all so much more real.Time and again I found myself in a position - a predicament - unlike that of the reader of the book. Where the book offers a fantasy with lots of cool characters and a derring- do plot, the movie, with its incredible realism, makes you a part of the story, and you can't really close your eyes and fall off to sleep - you live in this world, a world that is basically an evil, threatening one.I think Jackson has transcended Tolkien: He's taken LoTR and given it a vision, and I am sure he and his crew have studied the book meticulously, and therefore been able to bring out detail most readers did not notice or soon forgot.Elsewhere at the IMDb one can read of dissatisfied surfers who don't want to wait another year for the finale, who think that six months is too long to wait for a SE DVD; and I think the irony here is thick.For starters, JRR Tolkien was a professor and expert and lover of the English language; and yet here we find some of the worst abuses of it ever. And no one seems capable of even reflecting on the themes presented by JRR; it's more about how good the CGI is, how good other special effects are, or in the best possible case how well the movie follows the book. And yet JRR had something very important to say. Here's a message that could be debated for a long time, with the human race the great benefactor.But no. We shall instead agree that Smeagol is well done and that some of the helicopter landscape shots are well formatted and that Treebeard is convincing, Mr Greenleaf is still the swooner, and that Aragorn son of Arathorn is a fitting successor to Middle Earth.",Null,1,2,15 November 2006

That twang she had in Leon was fine and even spot on what the doctor ordered, but it's 'matured' (devolved) since than and her career could falter because of it.This movie has such depth, a kind of Seinfeld feel to it (Braff even looks and acts like Seinfeld in some scenes).

","It's hard to believe the US distributors could muck up this masterpiece as much as they have, but it isn't the first time. Central to this movie, beyond the incredible camera-work, is the music, and for once Eric Serra turns in an astounding score. Save for his attempt at being a rock singer at the very end, this is great work. (And yes it would have been a lot better if he'd stuck to one of his themes for the movie for the closing credits, but he does things like this, did it for a 007 movie, and was gratefully never asked back again.)Besson's parents were scuba diving instructors, so you get where he got the idea for this movie. And it's 'inspired' by real life stories - those of Jacques Mayol and Enzo Maiorca (called Molinari in the movie). Mayol also collaborates on the screenplay.Besson's photography is amazing. He's also made a short about dolphins dolphins and nothing but dolphins, so you get the fact he likes and is inspired by dolphins.Rosanna Arquette plays her part to a 't' and it's questionable if she's ever looked so delicious. And there are great locations for this one, especially in Taormina and what most likely is the renowned San Domenico Palace Hotel.Don't go for the shorter version, no matter on what side of the Atlantic it was made. Of course the one for the US market is directly atrocious, but cutting this down to a theatrical running time simply doesn't work. This one takes three hours: grin and bear it.There doesn't have to be a lot 'happening' in a movie to make it good, and this is proof. You want action? Rent a Jackie Chan or a Jean Claude god Damme. You want a movie that really gives you something sublime? Get this one.",Null,0,1,21 September 2006
Mission: Impossible II," Why Didn't They Ask Me?
","I can just see Xenu Princess Warrior over there, getting depressed as ever. He still doesn't have an Oscar (you mean the crying sequence in Top Gun wasn't good enough) and he's never been asked to play James Bond! Of course Cruise isn't English, which makes it difficult to consider him for the role, but if Cruise was the last English applicant left I am sure Brocoli would just shut the project down.This movie is just stupid. It is a total yawner. It has no brains. Most likely because the people who made it don't have any. And that includes the star. All he's trying to do is be James Bond. He can't get the role so he wants to show everyone he's better than 007. Hey that's going to work - not! In the first film they totally ruined the premise of the original series. They start out by deliberately sabotaging it so the screen writers can just pour out all this drivel. Hey that was great. Now they take the little intelligence left in the first one and get rid of it altogether.How about a new Rocky movie where Sly absolutely demolishes Cruise in the ring? Everyone would love that.Check the trivia section for this movie if you want another clue how brainless this is: the screen writer was directed to weave a plot through action scenes John Poo already decided on. This is even worse than Spielberg.The trivia section also says the movie was smuggled to theatres with the fictitious name 'Doll House'. That seems much more appropriate. Maybe Tom Cruise could take up Ibsen as a hobby. When he's finally gratefully out of work. And before he flies off with the thetans again.Total loser. 1 is too high a vote. 0 would still be too high.

Mission: Impossible," Good Night Mr Phelps
","This is horrible. Seeing that the average rating on this one at the IMDb is 6.6 at time of writing lends much credence to the oft-held postulate that the planet is increasingly populated by morons.Warrior god Xenu drops nuclear bombs in the volcanoes of the planet Earth only 75 million years ago in an attempt to cure his own civilisation of a slight issue with overpopulation - something on the order of a trillion gajillion zillion of them. This all makes perfect sense. And your mission, Tom, should you choose to accept it, is to go on screen in this shameless waste of a viable premise and make more of an ass out of yourself than even you had been capable of before.You've done everything you could to get an Oscar short of administering group oral sex to the entire AMPAS, so you maybe better concentrate on the green stuff instead - and face the fact your esteemed colleagues just don't like you.Watching Cruise go through the motions of being an action hero is pathetic - and then suddenly it dawns on you: this idiot is so crazy he really believes he's an action hero. He gets to be all the things he isn't in real life. This twit is long gone.In fact, thinking about this - inadvertently thinking about this, it's impossible to avoid, what with all we know today about what a looney tune Cruise is - makes it impossible to take this sorry excuse for a movie seriously.The original small screen formula is easy to research: it's listed here on the IMDb. Perhaps some of the IMDb's bumpkin reviewers would do themselves a service by reading up on it (if in fact they can read - this is open to debate, as we all know, as there is ample evidence they can neither type nor spell).The only light in this movie (aside from the visual delight of Emmanuelle Beart) is Henry Czerny who gets kudos for again (as in Clear and Present Danger) getting the style of the slimy crook down pat. How Czerny does this I do not know: they don't scrape his face as with Le Chiffre - he's always given a robot look and still he can come off as totally threatening. If fact I might even be a bit wary of this bloke if I met him on the street - that's how well I think he does his part.As for the rest of the movie, it's everything the critics said it was - and worse. Far far worse. It appeals only to people with an IQ below zero. Only to people whose brain cells work like amoebas and where Mother Nature is still waiting for that first cataclysmic split. There is no story - none; they dash the premise of the original to smithereens within minutes (leaving one to wonder why they wanted to grab the franchise in the first place) and the plot thereafter makes absolutely no sense at all. Worse, the special effects are horrendous. Cartoons do it better and are more realistic.This is the movie, box office success or no, that finally convinced the world Tom Cruise is nuts. Totally nuts. That he chooses to go out into the world and promote his latest cash cow MI3 while his 'wife' is at home going through labour with her test tube baby is only more evidence that Hollywood have an incredibly unique and totally hopeless loser on their hands.Good night Mr Phelps.",Null,2,4,30 April 2006

","No one will ever be able to replace Julia Roberts. Reading the trivia here, and if it's to be believed, mulling on who was considered for her role... There is no way any of the others would have worked as well as she does. She even makes some scenes in Runaway Bride work just on her personality alone.Back home, according to recent surveys, she's the #1 woman men dream of sleeping with. She doesn't impress me this way, but looking back on this movie one sees class and a fantastic actress.Everyone is good here - Gere too actually, and Hector is priceless. It's very well made and extremely well acted.The only drawback - two points on the ten star scale - is that this movie resulted in such an influx of US midwest girls all intent on coming to LA and hooking on the streets and meeting their own Richard Gere.It's reminiscent of how people were reputed to accost Larry Hagman on the street and rip him apart for being such a bastard, unable to distinguish between Larry the actor and JR Ewing the scum bag.And that's something a lot of people will never understand. And in the case of this movie, with all the 'chicken hawks' working the area, it was a real tragedy. So one wishes the movie could have had a slightly different import.Other than that, watch it and study how a great actress operates and above all study a great - a phenomenal - actress.

And were severely disappointed for the second time.I have no issue with Howard making this one. Someone was bound to, so why shouldn't he pick it up? What scares me is that he probably took it seriously.The author has some serious work to do to become a first rate author and he has some serious traveling (and foreign residence) to put behind him before he can be called someone capable enough of weaving a tale such as this.His language continually fails, as does his imagery, and I dare say his narrative style is nigh on non-existent - and this shows through as well in the final movie.This is like a Tom Stoppard conceit short circuited. It's a hodgepodge of lots of things good god fearing 'Americans' of course have no clue about (and for which they remain just as clueless afterwards) put together in the most haphazard fashion. To admire this movie necessitates approving of the total dime store novel aspects of it - and the 'hack' quality of its writing and plot.In other words, it's a piece of junk - a piece of trash, both the book and the movie, precisely because the tenet is so unbelievably childish and amateurish.This book was written not by someone who was familiar with the scenarios in the book but by someone who'd read about them. Imagery is so lacking and trivial that after a few sentences, a few abortive one or two page chapters, one is forced to put the rubbish down as utter nonsense.Of course the movie fares no better.

","This movie grows like a good wine. I really didn't get it when it was first released; I avoided it like the plague. But people have a curious tendency to mature and change their POVs with time, and so was it with me. This movie opened me up to a lot of things - believe it or not, I didn't get the 'Call Me' sequence at first: I was lost, and admit it. But I am not lost now, and this movie is partly responsible.Meg might be the reason guys want to see this movie, again and again, but after a while you begin to appreciate the contribution Crystal made to the film. The dialogue has his name all over it. The dialogue in this film is at times simply amazing - check the memorable quotes here if you've seen the movie and have forgot.I would not pick this movie out of a barrel as most likely to be so influential, but it's a fact that it is, and rightfully so. Great support from Kirby and Fisher. Today it's Hanks and Ryan who are paired, thanks undoubtedly to Sleepless in Seattle, but one wonders why no one has tried to get Crystal and Ryan back together again.

",It's rare to find an original 'romcom' but this is one. It's even more rare to find one that is good but this is one. Originality is very important here and most 'romcoms' today are embarrassingly cliché. But this one is different.The script is good. It took a lot of research and was written meticulously.The secondary characters are actually the main characters. James and Valletta steal the show and they're supposed to.The ending is a bit long and one wishes they'd found a way to speed it up - or rather not have it so unnecessarily drawn out - but there's a punch line at the end and so it's 'almost' worth waiting for.Does Will Smith ever make a bad movie? He can now claim he's made a refreshingly original romantic comedy and that certainly doesn't happen every day. Digging away at the IMDb yields earlier original 'romcoms' like Harry/Sally and Sleepless which are at least fifteen years old - between then and now about all that's happened is Matthew McConaughey.

Boipics are supposed to be factual, historical, and the ones that want to make big money go out and convince you they're doing that - as this one.And then you find out you've been lied to.Foxx is so strong in this one - he was nominated and then got the Oscar for best lead actor. You know this was hard work for him. And you literally do not realise it is him playing a role. He's that convincing.Everyone is very very good in this one, and the narrative succeeds in giving you an impartial look at the man, warts and all - and for that you love him and appreciate him more.And then you're on your way here to rate this movie and give it a '10' and then someone comes in and says 'did you know they changed history and for no good reason'.Mr Charles was to himself have read and approved the screenplay, so why did he let this pass?

And sticking with that movie a second, the story is cute and it's capable of holding together.Now cut to this 'gem'. Carrey's contortions are replaced - in some places augmented - by digitally created special effects. We need this? We want this?

Yes, the clues are there from the beginning, as there must be in all movies of this genre, so you could possibly pick it up early on.Some of the acting is superb. John Hawkes is a stand-out with many; he gets some fantastic lines. You may have seen Pruitt Taylor Vince in Murder One, where he plays more or less the same kind of part.Direction can be magnificent at times. Timing and precise writing in other words. Don't be surprised if you feel the movie is playing tongue in cheek with the audience and the genre.Should you go see it? My question exactly. I went because the g/f wanted to see a movie - any movie - and because the pickings have been so exceptionally (and dismally) slim for so long. Is it better than the average fare out right now?

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Yes But
","It's fantastic that someone finally succeeded in bring Tolkien to the big screen like this, and it took fantastic planning, and Jackson is deserving of every award he's received - and he should have received more.But there comes a time when CGI gets so close to but yet so far from reality that everything looks like a cartoon animated by van Gogh. I think these movies go too far without having much of a choice.The first part was enthralling because it was finally happening, and the Ringwraith were fantastic. The second part surprised by the emotion it invoked - it had all the flurry of a Lucas attempt at an epic but it had guts and grit too. And Jackson made his cast look earthy and human, and he introduced hormones into things that seem absent in the book(s).And it's a fantastic conclusion to be sure, but as with Titanic, the achievement is first and foremost that it happened and that it was a success. There is no way Jackson can get enough acclaim or recognition for what he has done.All I've got to say is I don't especially appreciate all these special effects. They come closer and closer to looking real but they will never be convincing. Serkis is amazing of course, and he should have received some sort of award. But there comes a time when the fantasy of the mind is better than trying to paint the impossible on screen.A lot of people will laud the movie because the effects were so good; this doesn't have squat to do with the quality of the movie. Like saying James Bond's Aston Martin is cool, therefore Connery/Lazenby/Moore/Dalton/Brosnan are good actors.No one can take away from Jackson what he did: a major achievement, a milestone in cinematic and cultural history. But I wasn't overly impressed, and in fact found myself looking at my watch wondering when it would all finally be over. Maybe I was satisfied the movie had made it and lost interest because I already knew the ending; maybe it was the plethora of CGI wizardry that had me longing for Wiley Coyote and his Roadrunner friend.At least there no one's trying to fool you into thinking it's real.",Null,4,6,12 January 2006

And a bit of sex provided by Brooke Langton.It's a straightforward and deliberately unrealistic conceit: a football team go on strike, so Jack Warden uses Gene Hackman to round up a Con-Air team - and you basically know how things will turn out.There's ample room for stereotyped characters, prefab comedy situations, and dozens of eminently predictable subplots. Also you're drowned in standard NFL muzak.

Thirteen Days," Hollywood Story
","It's a sad day in history when people watch a movie and think they're seeing history. Completely forgetting that Hollywood are not about to give them facts if said facts make them uncomfortable and not wanting to come back for more.It's a sad day when people can't do their own research - especially today when the resources of the World Wide Web stand at everyone's disposal.But in the gung-ho mindset of the US, it's perhaps not surprising. Hollywood is more liberal than a lot of people think, but that doesn't mean they're about to tell the truth if said truth should in any way interfere with their box office.There is a clear agenda here - and considering the real story of this historical event, there is a thin line one must tread, as going too far in making the actual facts all too explicit could easily alienate the charged audience. Hollywood knows cinema at their level can't be scandalous - and yet to tell the true story of this 'Cuban missile crisis' at such a level of exposure would have caused a scandal.In 1961 the United States committed an act of aggression against the Soviet Union. The US deployed fifteen intermediate range nuclear missiles closer to the Turkish border, directly threatening cities in the Soviet Union.Soviet strategists tried to achieve equality by placing missiles in Cuba. The crisis was finally resolved when Khrushchev, after waving the big stick, started dangling the carrot: if the US backed their missiles in Turkey, he'd remove the weapons in Cuba. He even let the US look the heroes - and in this concession won disfavour with his own back home who didn't see as he should have done that.But hawks were on both sides of this conflict, as the movie shows. What it does not show however is the actual truth of the story. In typical Hollywood fashion things are made up and the US have to look good by the final credits. When in fact if the mad brass in the Pentagon hadn't been pushing so hard all along, the entire affair would have been avoided and that generation would have been spared one major scare.This cannot come forth in a Hollywood movie. Of course it can't. And many of the reviewers who have colleagues at their offices who know the full score don't even know it because it's kept conveniently from public sight as much as possible - it finds its way to the back page of newspapers and history books lots of those 'god fearing' people in the US don't want their poor children to read.And yet the facts stand for themselves. One need only wander over to Wikipedia to read the 'real' story without the Hollywood trimmings and falsehoods. A great crisis was brought on the world because of a bunch of mad generals in Washington - and the worst of it is they probably never regretted it, probably never woke up and realised what they'd attempted to perpetrate.The movie does give adequate insight into the kinds of political power struggles that go on in any government and how hard it can be for a public leader to control military idiots like this. At times the actors' portrayals go a bit too far over the top: the grimaces and dirty looks are just too evil (or are they).But at the end of the day it's like this: if you've heard about this crisis as we have and you want to find out what really happened, don't rely on this movie. As is said in so many words: 'we need to get the truth here'. And it doesn't matter that Jack Nicholson's character in another movie about the military bellows out: 'you can't handle the truth'.

Remarks about Schadenfreude are also all right if you're totally lacking in polyglot chops, sophistication, and all-around intelligence quotient.In other words the movie's about pain - more specifically pain to the skull and nether regions. And that's funny, says the director/writer.Not that the movie is a total wash-out - after all, it's rated a '2' instead of a '1' - but it takes quite a lot to climb up that single rung of the ladder, not the least of which are VV and above all Christine Taylor who presents incredible eye candy.Hey! You might like it! Not to worry about subtleties like the fact they waste more time and money on scenography than on developing a truly humorous script - it's got a lot of gags and dumb one-liners and three second cameos from people you'd least expect to see and hope you wouldn't have to see.So renting this one won't be a total waste. Unless of course you have better things to do with your evening. Unless the local gym is fully booked and you can't get in a game of dodge ball of your own. Unless your goldfish are tired of playing charades with you. Unless you're a total loser.So go ahead - rent it! Enjoy!",Null,0,1,10 November 2006
The Godfather," Sucks
","I cannot express strongly enough how bad this movie sucks. Great music, great actors - but what does that give you? Coppola has everyone but his nursemaid employed in this one; Puzo's screenplay is pure speculation and nothing but - and the mob supposedly loved it; but people took this seriously: they really thought Puzo (and Coppola) had an inside track when they did not. And Puzo and Coppola knew full well what they were doing, making this movie as unconscionable as they come. And after that I don't care how many monkey movies Brando studied at home, or whether he propped his cheeks with orange segments or thousand dollar bills: this movie is cheap, and it sucks, and please tell me: if Coppola is all that good, why is there nothing coming out of that supposedly great mind of his? Nothing but the same old schtick, the same three worn out pseudo epics, the same three better forgotten films, recycled and recycled and recycled? No one gets this, but despite the great acting ensemble, this movie, its two follow-ups, its creator and director, and its screenwriter are the biggest bunch of hyped losers in Hollywood history.",Null,5,23,23 September 2002
