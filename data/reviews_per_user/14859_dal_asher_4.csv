Ford v Ferrari," Got Me Back to the Movie Theater
",I generally don't enjoy going to the movies anymore since I can wait a few months and watch on our big screen in the comfort of my own home but I was excited to see this movie. We saw it the day it opened in our local theater and I was not disappointed. What a great film. Damon and Bale were fantastic from beginning to end. The characters were very well developed and you actually felt like you knew these guys! The whole cast was phenomenal. I'm not much of a race car fan but this movie had suspense and humor that made it entertaining for everyone! Well done!!,10,26,49,18 November 2019
Million Dollar Arm," A feel good movie!
","I lived in India for nearly 3 years and can really identify with this movie. A down on his luck sports agent, Jon Hamm, goes to India to try and recruit a baseball pitcher in a contest called Million Dollar Arm. His scout, played by the always wonderful Alan Arkin, is a welcome addition to the cast. They also recruit a young Indian, Amit, played by Pitobash who is excellent in the roll, as the interpreter. After traveling all over India they find a couple of young men who are very raw but have potential. Of course they've never played baseball before so it's not going well. Enter Coach house played by Bill Paxton. He has six months to turn them into baseball players so they can have a try out with a major league team. Lake Bell as the love interest and nurturing influence has good chemistry with all the guys. Based on a true story (with, I imagine, plenty of literary license) it makes for a good, old fashioned uplifting movie. I've seen this now several times and enjoy it as much now as I did the first time I saw it. I'm not a huge baseball fan but it wasn't so much about the baseball as it was about second chances. Probably not for everyone but a good vehicle for Jon Hamm as he moves off the small screen and into movies.",8,0,0,14 November 2015
The Legend of Bagger Vance," Loved This Movie!
","I loved this movie and felt that it was truly underrated. Matt Damon and Will Smith were magical and the chemistry between them was so believable. The story of a down and out golfer who overcomes the adversity of war and pulls himself from the depth of despair to rise like a phoenix from the ashes is not a new one but this one makes it seem fresh. Charlize Theron is good as the love interest and it works. The kid who inspires and believes in him adds so much to the story. And Jack Lemon as the old man (who was the kid as a youngster) gives the story depth. It inspires a love of the game of golf even in those who previously hadn't found it very interesting. It's a wonderful history lesson about the game and since I first saw this movie I began to enjoy watching golf on TV. I may even attend one of the big tournaments one of these days. The character development and back stories are interesting throughout and it makes for an engaging movie. I've seen this many times and whenever I need a feel good movie, I watch this.",9,1,2,23 June 2015
Straight Outta Compton," Excellent History of Rap Music
","My husband and I watched this last night on DVD and although we aren't fans of rap music, we both found this movie an excellent history of the genre. It tells the story of Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, Easy-E, MC Ren and D.J. Yella, all well played by Corey Hawkins, O'Shea Jackson, Jr., Jason Mitchell, Neil Brown, Jr., and Aldis Hodge respectively. The story begins when Dr. Dre leaves the home of his mother as she wants him to get a regular job to support his girlfriend and newborn son. He is frustrated by his need for self expression and his dream of creating something new that will speak to the young people struggling with unending police harassment and discrimination. He meets up with Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti), a music manager who offers to manage Dr. Dre and his like minded friends, N.W.A. Dre is the producer and Easy-E and Ice Cube write and rap. They produce their first hit with Straight Outta Compton. As the police continue their harassment of them they express their feelings of anger and frustration through the lyrics and rhymes. This resonates with young people around the country and they are soon stars. The usual problems come up and they move away from each other and Jerry, some making better decisions that the others. Although they part ways, the bond remains a deep one that will eventually bring them back together after a tragedy. This movie was well acted by all and even though we have never really liked rap, this was truly eye-opening. We understand and appreciate where it began now and can respect the genre in a way we never expected. This movie engaged us throughout and I can recommend it for any one that can get past the language and violence. It was needed for authenticity. Really good movie!",8,4,30,20 December 2015
