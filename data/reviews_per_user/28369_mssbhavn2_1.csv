Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Are we really so shallow...
","I am offended by the assumption that Americans are so shallow and stupid that we won't realize that this extremely over-rated and over-hyped film is neither funny nor meaningful. There were two spots that were funny enough to elicit a laugh, and those were weak slapstick which aren't memorable enough for comment now - one week after viewing.Borat! makes its point if the point has to do with how disgusting human animals are or how the only thing a woman is good for is sex or the true nature of men is more debased than that of a common farm swine. Otherwise, it is pointless.Women, beware. I doubt this film depicts men in the U.S. realistically, but if these scenes are, indeed, unscripted then we are the target of some really bizarre and insulting ideas.
