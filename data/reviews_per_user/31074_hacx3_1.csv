The Hangover," Funny
","Funny and at times over the top (especially those jokes involving the baby). It's defiantly worth seeing in the theater. I had a number of good laughs and with the audience response it was a little better. Don't expect reality here - it's one long skit of sight gags. But that's what it's intended to be. If you can suspend your disbelief (and you will need to to get past the obviously unrealistic events), get past the fact that there's really not much of a plot, some stereo-typical garbage, and just enjoy the laughs you'll like this movie. I thought the acting was sufficient. One warning, its definitely not for kids.",8,2,5,11 June 2009
