Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Going for the story of the book? Not here
","Now i have read all the books of Sherlock Holmes, and if you are going to this movie thinking that they have made it from the book, then you are wrong and will be disappointed. This movie has as much with the original book of Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty to do as Sherlock Holmes has to do with The Detective Colombo. Yes they are both detectives and they solve crime, but thats about it. Many characters in this movie doesn't exist in the original book, a lot of the main story of the film don't exist in the book and Sherlock Holmes don't act like the Sherlock Holmes in the book would have done. The creator of this movie has not given Sherlock Holmes the credit that he deserves. This movie doses not deserve to be called Sherlock Holmes. If this movie had been called something completely else, i would have given this movie more stars, but since this is called Sherlock Holmes then i cannot give this movie more stars.. because it don't justify to be called Sherlock Holmes.",8,17,34,25 December 2011
Aladdin," Lost a bit of magic but i still enjoyable.
","So i sat down to watch this movie with a friend. I loved the original animated version as a kid. Genie was always super fun and made a lot of magic happen. Will Smith as genie was a good cast. He is a great actor. The only thing that was missing was a bit of the magic. I felt the original genie had a bit more POW and FIZZ. And was a bit more like clowny? But you gotta remember that the original was a animated movie made for kids, which of cause gives a lot more freedom to do that sort of thing more easily. But Will Smith still made it work. And he made the songs into his own. Aladdin and Yasmin and the sultan was very good in their roles. They looked right and did a fine job acting. Carpet and Abu was good too. Where i felt it was missing a bit was with Jaffar and Iago. It was like they wherent evil enough, there was not enough battle between Aladdin and Jaffar. And Iago actually being just a parrot without the real ability to talk normally was also a bit of a let down. But the scenery and colors and setting was very well made. So its still well worth a watch, but its not a 10 out of 10.",7,0,1,27 August 2019
Finding Dory," A good fun adventure!
","This is supposed to be a sequel to Finding Nemo? Well No its not called Finding Nemo 2. Its called Finding Dory! Its a new movie in the Finding Nemo universe. And yes we get to see bits an pieces from Finding Nemo, but Finding Dory is its own film. Add i liked it. You know now a days when you watch a movie right?, you often get to thinking halfway into the movie if this will soon be over. You know if the movie is good but not super good. You will start wondering if its over soon. But with Finding Dory i never got that thought. When it ended i was like, wow! This went fast! I felt time flew when i watched this. I am a big fan of Finding Nemo and Pixar in general. And Finding Dory is a good edition to the Pixar universe! I had some good laughs and it has a great story! Not boring at all. Yes yes its not as good as Finding Nemo, but that's how it always is. Most of the time the next movie in a series is never as good as the first one. But its not far from it. It really is a good movie. I believe i gave Finding Nemo 8 and Finding Dory 7. And its funny, the people that really like a movie seldom writes anything about it, where as the people that don't like it often feel like they have to tell the world about it. Its the same in here. The movie rating is 7.7 but if we only took the rating of the reviews it would have a rating of 4. So don't listen to the grumpy people in the reviews! Its a good fun movie that if you liked Finding Nemo, you have should watch this too! No doubt about it!",7,3,10,1 November 2016
