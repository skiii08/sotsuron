Despicable Me 2," I really liked it, very funny and great fun. Not as good as the first one.
","DESPICABLE ME 2It was a very funny film, but nowhere near as good as the original movie.Gru is recruited by the Anti-Villain League to track down a super villain who has stolen an entire research lab from the Arctic. Gru has to investigate this crime with his new partner, Lucy. Whilst all this is going on, his oldest daughter has started to find boys attractive which then leads Gru to anger and he has to do his investigations whilst watching his daughter with this new boy... and if that wasn't enough, his minions are getting kidnapped too.The story was enjoyable, and the characters were brilliant. The thing I noticed about this film the most though, is they film makers knew that the minions were really popular from the original movie, so they made them more of the main characters in this one. I thought the minions had the funny parts and were the main advertising technique they used for the film. The only thing I was slightly disappointed with, was the really funny bits of the movie were shown in the trailer... there are other really good bits, but most of the them I had already seen.The voice cast was quite impressive, but I never understood why. Steve Carell, Kristen Wiig, Benjamin Bratt, Mirander Cosgrove, Russell Brand, Ken Jeong & Steve Coogan are the voices. Why would the movie company pay so much more for famous people to use their voices, when they could clearly find someone unknown and the audience would not know the difference? Especially Steve and Russell... if I didn't already know that they did these voices, I would never had recognised them, so surely they could have found someone cheaper. But I don't mind... it's their money. I suppose it is just to draw in the crowd a bit more.This movie is great for kids and will keep them quiet and entertained for the duration. Very funny & great fun.I will give this film 7 out of 10.Very good, but not as good as the firstFor more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,0,1,9 July 2013
The Mask," I love this movie and can't say anything bad about it.
","THE MASKI remember watching this when it first came out. It was such a big thing back then.The movie is about a sad lonely banker who finds a mask one day. When he goes home and tries it on the mask sticks to his face and changes him into a completely different person. The problem is, he robs a bank that a criminal organisation were already going to raid. Now they are after him as well as the police.This is a comedy that is more like a cartoon than live action. There is slapstick as well as musical sequences. But it is all so well done that you can't help but watch it in wonder.The movie stars Jim Carrey and Cameron Diaz. This was Camerons first movie. She was very good in it considering she didn't have much acting experience. Jim was fantastic in this, Back in the 90s is when Jim was in his prime. He was making so many great movies back then and he was so funny. This is probably my favourite Jim Carrey film. He is still making good movies now, but they just don't seem to be as funny as the ones he made back in the day. One of my favourite characters ion the film though is not even human. Milo was fantastic. Milo was Jims dog in the movie. The dog that was used was so well trained that even he was really funny and made me laugh so much.As I said before, there are some musical numbers in the film. Yes it is done in a very cheesy way, but it fits in with the movie very well. The songs are very catchy and funny to watch... especially Cuban Pete. I actually bought the 12' vinyl single of this back in 1994.The special effects are still very good even for now... so you can imagine how good they were when the movie came out in 1994. It really was amazing back then and it was completely awesome to watch.There is a sequel to The Mask called the Son of the Mask... avoid at all costs. It is terrible and really destroys this classic film.The Mask is so funny and very entertaining. It really is one of my favourite films from the 90s.I will give this film 8 out of 10.'Hold on, sugar! Daddy's got a sweet tooth tonight!'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",8,1,1,1 December 2013
The Avengers," Excellent film
","THE AVENGERS ASSEMBLEI had seen this film when it came out in the cinema and I was blown away. I thought it was awesome.I watched it for a second time yesterday and felt the same way it is such a great film and well put together.I had seen all of the original films about the characters and I had mixed reviews about them.Captain America = I didn't like it.Thor = I thought it was good.Iron Man = I loved it.Iron Man 2 = I liked it, just not as much as the first one.The Incredible Hulk = I liked it.But put them together and you have an amazing film.The story was good, the action was great, the characters were great and the actors were great.Everyone did a good job but for me the main character and star was Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man.A lot of people thought the Hulk was the best character, and he was great but there is just something about Iron Man that I think is special.Besides, I like RDJ I think he is a great actor.I was a little bit confused as to why someone different played Bruce Banner/Hulk I was expecting Edward Norton to reprise his role from The Incredible Hulk.I still don't know why he didn't do it.Robert Downey Jr., Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson & Jeremy Renner all make a great team.Since this film was released, news has broken that there will be a lot of sequels on the way. Thor 2, Captain America 2 and Iron Man 3 to name a few.Then in 2015 there will be The Avengers 2.There are some great comedy moments in this movie too. Hulk is the main character that made me laugh. He just doesn't care about anyone and his actions make good comedy at times.The success of this film really has boosted the comic to film transition. Man of Steel comes out this year and there are a lot more Marvel & DC comics coming to the big screen.I am a super-hero fan, (in the movies I never read the comics) so for me this is only good news. I just hope they don't ruin any of the classic characters.I will give this film 8 out of 10.It is better than all of the individual movies and I can't wait for the sequel in 2015.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",8,1,6,17 April 2013
Black Swan," You do not need to be a ballet fan to enjoy this movie
","What an amazing film.I have always been tempted to see this film, but the only thing that put me off was the ballet. I don't mind ballet, but I am not really a fan. But the trailer for this movie does look really good... My girlfriend and I watched it last night and I was not disappointed.The story is about a ballet dancer who takes ballet very seriously. She is fighting to get the role of the Swan Queen in Swan Lake, and when she gets it she is fighting to keep it... but she is a very disturbed and paranoid person.It stars Natalie Portman... I am a fan of hers, I think she has made some great movies. But this to me is the best performance of her career. She is so believable. It also has Mila Kunis who plays her ballet rival. Also, in a supporting role, you h ave Winona Ryder. A very strong cast.The story is very tense and full of suspense. I was that engrossed that at one point, i jumped a mile. haha.Also, the special effects that were used in this movie were very impressive.This thriller is such a good movie, that you do not need to like ballet to enjoy the film. If you like thrillers, you should see this film.I will give this film an 8 out of 10.Amazing story, amazing acting, amazing film!For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204",8,1,3,12 December 2012
The Incredible Hulk," A much better film... Let's forget the first.
","THE INCREDIBLE HULKWow... At least they made a decent Hulk film this time. This film fixes everything that the last film ruined.The story is 100% better. I'm really glad that this is not a sequel. This is a whole new film, you don't even need to even think about the original film. You don't need to worry about it being part of the story as this one just starts again.This film has it all. Action, drama, romance, thriller... And the best part is there is not too much of any one thing. It is spread out really well.I really liked the characters in this movie. You really did feel sorry for Bruce. He is always on the run. It is a well put together chase film.The effects were mostly good. There were times when I thought the Hulk or the other monster didn't look very real, but it didn't ruin the fun of the film.The casting was perfect. Edward Norton was a brilliant Bruce Banner. I was really disappointed to see he was not in the Avengers Assemble. Especially as there was an awesome little cameo at the end by the legendary Robert Downey Jr﻿. It tied it all up nicely for the big film. Other cast members were Liv Tyler, Tim Roth and William Hurt. Excellent job done by all... Especially Tim. His character was a power hungry, evil man... And it was played perfectly. I really hated hi throughout this film. He was scary.Of course Stan Lee makes his usual cameo nicely. I do hope that one day he plays a bigger part. It would surprise everyone and it would be great. The other thing I really liked about this is the original TV series had a couple of nods of appreciation. The Hulk in this was voiced by the original Hulk himself, Lou Ferrigno﻿, and also he makes a cameo as a security guard. Nice touch.I suppose I would like to have seen a little bit more Hulk in the film. It felt like there were long periods of not seeing him.This is a very good film, entertaining and a lot of fun, but it's not the best comic book film out there.I will give this 7 out of 10.'You won't like me when I' hungry.'For more reviews please like my Facebook page.Ordinary Person Movie Reviews.",7,0,0,29 July 2014
Lucky Number Slevin," I liked it... good cast list.
","LUCKY NUMBER SLEVINIt was quite good. All the way through the film, it seems Levin is in the wrong place at the wrong time. He is quite possibly the unluckiest person in the world... He loses his job, his house gets renovated, he finds his girlfriend in bed with another man, he gets mugged, his friend goes missing, he gets kidnapped as he is mistaken for his friend and is told he owes a gangster $95,000... then he gets kidnapped again and finds out he has to pay another gangster $35,000... all in one day!What a bad day or is it?This film stars Josh Hartnett as Slevin. He meets a girl who wants to help him and she is played by Lucy Liu. The gang bosses are played by Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley. There is also a hit-man in the movie played by Bruce Willis. The whole cast is very good. Everyone does a great job... But I have to say, my favourite character is a guy named Sloe. Sloe is a meathead played by Mykelti Williamson. He was not in the movie much, but when he was on screen, he was so funny.There are some funny moments in the film and some twists that I was not expecting. But then there were some twists that I saw coming a mile away.This film is entertaining all the way through... and well worth a watch if you have not seen it.I will give it 7 out of 10.Disagree? Let me know. :)For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,0,0,29 March 2013
Sucker Punch," Not a great film, but entertaining enough.
","SUCKER PUNCHI had heard nothing but bad things about this movie... but I never go with other people opinions, I like to come to my own conclusion.The movie is about a girl who is left with her step father after the death of her mother. She is abused and sent off to a mental institute for the death of her sister (which she didn't do). While there she starts getting these visions that she is a dancer in a brothel. Her mission is to escape with some of the other girls and find the freedom she is looking for.The story is very confusing at times and not easy to follow. It was OK in the end when it explained itself, but it was still not a very strong story.The effects were not great. Some of it was very good, but at other times it felt like I was watching a computer game. It could have been better. There were times where I thought that it was good... some of the 'dream' characters were really well done. I liked the way that when some of the soldiers got killed, steam came out of the wound instead of blood. I thought that was different and looked great.The acting was average at best. There were some actors who did a good job, but others just seemed bad. The movie starred Emily Browning as Babydoll. Unfortunately I thought she did a bad job. She was not very convincing and her fighting scenes looked uncomfortable. Other cast members were Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgensï»¿, Jamie Chung, Carla Gugino and Oscar Isaac. Oscar was the best actor in this by far. He was creepy and horrible and played it really well.It looked like all the girls that were there to kick some butt, just didn't have it in them. You could tell these girls felt like they couldn't do it and the fighting scenes suffered because of it.I don't think this film deserves the bad wrap it got. It was not a great film by any means, but it was entertaining enough if you don't expect a great big box office movie.I will give it 6 out of 10.'Have you ever wanted to just take something back?

Source Code," A great film...
","SOURCE CODEThis is a bit like Groundhog Day but with a mission. It was very good.The movie is about a bloke who wakes up on a train, but he is not himself. When he looks into a mirror he sees a different man. 8 minutes later... the train explodes killing everyone on board. Then he wakes up again in a capsule where he is told that he has to do it again until he finds the person who planted the bomb on the train... he then wakes up on the train again with 8 minutes to go until the bomb goes off.It is a bit confusing to begin with as it doesn't really explain itself until about two thirds into the movie. We were wondering what was actually happening and why. This film does keep you guessing though. There are a lot of people on the train an the terrorist could be any one of those people. The only problem is, my gorgeous girlfriend and I guessed who it was right from the beginning. That's not to say it is too obvious, we probably just got lucky.The film stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farmiga & Jeffrey Wright. The acting is great... I can't say a bad word about any of the performances here. Jake does a great job.There are some really good slow motion shots when the train explodes too. The effects were good.I will give this film 7 out of 10.A very entertaining sci-fi/thriller.For more of my movie reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,0,0,9 June 2013
Skyfall," Bond is back!
","Bond is back baby!This film is awesome... I was so surprised at how good it is.I do like Casino Royale and even Quantum of Solace, but to me they didn't feel like Bond movies. There was something missing from them... but as action films, they were awesome. But, Skyfall brings it right back. This is a Bond film! It has it all... I never saw Daniel Craig as James Bond before, but this film has finally, in my opinion, changed that... he is now James Bond.The beginning action sequence was amazing... I really liked the chase at the beginning of Casino Royale, but this blew it away... what a great opening to a movie.Skyfall has a really good story to go along with the action. I honestly am struggling to find a fault with this film. It has some parts in the film that give a wink to some of the classic Bond movies, which I thought were clever and a lot of fun. Plus it was so good to hear the original Bond theme tune again.Javier Bardem plays Raoul Silva, the main bad guy in the movie... and he does a really good job... Another classic Bond villain.The only thing I can think of to criticise this film is, it is a long movie, and it felt long. It is on for nearly 2 and a half hours! I was in the cinema and towards the end I was really uncomfortable and fidgeting, I couldn't feel my butt anymore and wanted to stand up. But even though it is a long movie, you don't get bored... It was entertaining from beginning to end.I know all Bond films are unrealistic, but there were a couple of moments in this one that I felt were a little too unrealistic. They really stuck out. But again, it didn't spoil the enjoyment of the movie.I will give this film 9 out of 10.Excellent film, and if you like the classic James Bond films and have not seen Skyfall yet... go and see it!For more reviews, check out my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",9,1,12,29 November 2012
The Hangover," A lot better the second time around.
","THE HANGOVERI remember watching this when it first came out and I was the only one out of all of my friends that thought it was crap.The film is about 4 guys who go to Vegas to celebrate a stag party. The problem is, the stag is missing and nobody can remember what went on the night before. There are a lot of things wrong when they wake up the next morning. The stag is missing, the room they are in is wrecked, the dentist is missing a tooth, there is a tiger in the bathroom and they find out they have as police car! Their missing is to now try and retrace their steps to find out where their friend is so they can get him back in time for the wedding.As I said at the beginning, I have seen this before and was very disappointed. But after watching it again I really liked it this time around. The story is really well planned out. I love the idea of the film starting when it has already all gone wrong. You have no idea, just like the characters, what has happened and it is a great adventure what happened the night before.I loved some of the twists in the story. It does just keep you laughing throughout. Just when you think it couldn't get worst something else comes to light and you realise it is a lot worse than expected. The characters were not very likable. Every one of them has something about them that makes them the worst friends in the world. But they do stick together and do not stop until they get their friend back. The acting was really good throughout. It makes a change but the casting was perfect. The film stars Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, Justin Bartha, Heather Graham and Ken Jeong. There was even a great cameo by Iron Mike Tyson. Mike can't act to save his life and he definitely can't sing but it did add to the comedy in this movie.The adventure in this film plays along so well that it is a roller-coaster ride to watch. This film is very funny and if you have seen it and didn't like it, watch it again. I liked it a whole lot more the second time around.I will give this 7 out of 10.'What do tigers dream of when they take their little tiger snooze? Do they dream of mauling zebras, or Halle Berry in her Catwoman suit? Don't you worry your pretty striped head, we're gonna get you back to Tyson and your cozy tiger bed. And then we're gonna find our best friend Doug, and then we're gonna give him a best friend hug. Doug, Doug, oh, Doug, Dougie, Dougie, Doug, Doug! But if he's been murdered by crystal meth tweakers, well then we're sh*t out of luck.'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,0,0,23 September 2014
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," An absolute classic.
","WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT?It has been a long time since I saw this movie. I loved it when I was a kid... and I still love it today!The first movie I saw in 2014... and it is a classic!The film is about a private investigator who is hired to take a few photographs of a singer who is accused of cheating on her husband, TV star Roger Rabbit. But when a few photos starts a bigger investigation into murder the case soon hots up.This film was a complete break through in movies. There has been a few movies where live action was mixed with animation, but this was so far ahead of all of the others that the others were not in the same league.The whole film is so well done. The way the actors mix with the cartoons is amazing and most of the time you can't really tell they are not looking at anything. The whole cast did a fantastic job.The film stars Bob Hoskins. Bob is a legend and it is a shame that he has retired. For me this is his best film. Other cast members were Christopher Lloyd. Christopher played Judge Doom. A judge that has found a way to kill 'toons'. He actually plays quite a scary character. I remember watching this as a kid and thinking he was freaky. Especially at the end of the movie. Joanna Cassidy was also one of the main characters. The voice work was awesome too. Charles Fleischer is the voice of Roger as well as a lot of other characters. Charles has had a great career so far. He is in a lot of movies that I have seen and didn't know it was him! Kathleen Turner is the voice of Jessica Rabbit. Every single person in this film was brilliant.The story was like something I had never seen before. This film brings back so many memories for me. It is one of my childhood favourites and will stay with me my whole life. I will watching this film again and again. I will never get bored of it... I can't wait until my baby girl is old enough to watch it with me. I want it to be a part of her childhood too.The main thing I love about this movie is the characters that were put together... The classic Warner Brothers short characters, Buggs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Yosamity Sam etc, all on the same screen as Disney classics Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck... even Dumbo! Betty Boop, Tweetie Pie, Daffy Duck, Goofy... the list just goes on and on.I honestly love this film and have nothing bad to say about it. Every single child should watch this film... they would love it.I am giving this film 9 out of 10.'I'm not bad. I'm just drawn that way.'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",9,2,2,1 January 2014
Gravity," Amazing from beginning to end!
","GRAVITYWhen I found out that I managed to get tickets to a preview screening of Gravity, I was so happy. I have been waiting for this film for ages. Ever since I saw the trailer I instantly wanted to see it. I thought the trailer looked amazing. So, there I was sitting in the cinema waiting for the film to start, 3D glasses on and thinking to myself 'I really hope this does not disappoint'. I had the same feeling about Open Water. The trailer for that looked good it had the potential to be a good film, but when I watched it I was so disappointed. I thought it was very boring and felt let down. I didn't want that feeling again, so I tend not to get too excited about a film, but with this I could not help it. Thankfully this film was amazing! Far better than I thought it was going to be.The film is about a group of astronauts that are in space fixing a satellite. All of a sudden there are reports of a missile destroying another satellite and the debris is heading towards the astronauts. Their ship get's hit badly and they have to fight to survive being stranded free floating in space.The story is so gripping. It has been a very long time since a film has had me glued and worried about the characters as much as this. I spent the whole film so tense. I could not relax at all. I even found myself holding my breath a couple of times too. You really find yourself getting into it. You don't really know the characters before everything kicks off, but that doesn't matter. There is no time to introduce the characters as it is pretty much action from the start. You grow to like these characters a lot and all the way through I had no idea if they would survive or not. I like this because it was an original story. Yes, there have been other space disaster movies, but this felt completely different than anything I had seen before.The casting was perfect. Sandra Bullock takes the lead role. She was really good and convincing. I always said she was better in serious roles and this is, in my opinion, the best film she has ever made. There are talks of her getting nominated for an Oscar for this I think she deserves it. It was also really good that Sandra made this film with no make-up on at all. It made it feel more realistic. It is a brave move really for a big Hollywood actress to be seen on screen without anything to make her look made up. George Clooney was the other main character. He did a fantastic job also. You really like his character. He has a laid back more relaxed attitude in space just cruising around with his jet pack on. But he seems to be the character that takes charge. I think he should get some good recognition for this too.The film was shot really well. Space looked amazing. The film was visually beautiful. There were so many shots where I was wishing I was up there. As a photographer I would love to be taking photos of those views. The other thing I really liked about this movie was the soundtrack. The music was very well put together and made the 0065perience even more tense. I also loved the fact that when there was an explosion in space or a crash you heard nothing but the music. In space there are no sounds so it is great that this film kept it real.If I was to say anything negative about this film I would have to say that the 3D could have been better. It was really good in places, but in other places, it was not very good. There were a few places where you could see there were bits that were meant to come out, but didn't really. But this did not ruin the movie too much. I am also thinking that if I watched this in 2D it would be a bit weird because a couple of times you could see it was made for 3D. It might look a bit out of place in 2D. But it shouldn't ruin the film too much. This film is one that has to be seen in the cinema, in 3D watch it in IMAX if you can you will not regret it.I loved this movie and will give it 9 out of 10.'No, no, no, Houston, don't be anxious. Anxiety is bad for the heart.'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",9,3,5,23 October 2013
Citizen Kane," I didn't like it much.
","CITIZEN KANE.I didn't like it, but I appreciated it.The story is about a guy who runs a newspaper. He dies and his last word was Rosebud. Journalists are now investigating why he chose that as his last word and speaking with everyone who knew him.I quite like the story of them trying to find the meaning of someones last words. But it was very slow in places. I thought there were moments that were quite boring as nothing really happened. But there were a few scenes and bits in the film that I thought were entertaining.The acting was alright, but not as good as I was expecting.But I do appreciate that fact that at the time it was made, it was the first film to use the camera in that fashion. I know some of the shots in that film were never used before and is now taken for granted as we see the kind of angles in all film these days. So for that alone Citizen Kane is a classic.I will give this film a 5 out of 10.Not my kind of movie, but it has got some good moments.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page.http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",5,1,5,22 December 2012
The Hunger Games," I really enjoyed it... bring on part 2.
","THE HUNGER GAMESI was not very eager to see this. I saw the trailer and thought it looked just like a rip off of one of my favourite foreign movies, Battle Royale.It had it's similar parts, but in the most part it made the story it's own.The film is about a TV show called the Hunger Games. Every year 2 people from different areas have to compete in the games... they have no choice. 24 people are in an area and must fight to the death until there is only one person left alive.The film centres around one character from District 12, Katniss. She is a talented hunter which definitely helps her with the Games... but she has a nightmare along the way.The acting was actually quite good. There were a lot of good actors in this movie... some I had heard of before and some that are new to me. Katniss was played by Jennifer Lawrence. I had only ever seen her in X- Men First Class. She was good in that, and she was good in this also. Other cast members are Woody Harrelson, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz, Stanley Tucci & Donald Sutherland.I am a big Woody Harrelson fan... he is in one of my favourite films ever... Natural Born Killers. I didn't know he was in this until I watched it... it was a good surprise.The characters are great. I love the look of the film and the characters. Their make-up and costumes were awesome. They reminded me in a way of a Tim Burton movie. They were colourful but creepy. The effects were really good too.The action was really good, but a bit gory for kids. My 12 year old daughter watched it and I thought it was a bit harsh for her. She was fine though and loved the film. I really enjoyed the action. There was some amazing fighting scenes. It was well choreographed and put together.I will give this film 7 out of 10.It was very enjoyable and I am looking forward to Catching Fire.If you would like to read more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=tn_tnmn",7,0,3,21 June 2013
The Impossible," Excellently executed.
","THE IMPOSSIBLEI remember watching the news at Christmas time in 2004 and thinking how bad the Tsunami hit the world. It made a very happy time of year a disaster there were over 200,000 deaths in numerous countries around the world. This film is about one families fight to survive and be reunited together.The film is shot so well. The whole thing is so realistic and scary. It brought back memories of watching the news. It is a sad story this film really does show how dangerous nature can be. Life is a precious thing and we should all cherish the time we have together, because all it takes is one natural disaster and it is all over.Anyway back to the movie. The direction of this film is brilliant and deserves praise. The film was directed by J. A. Bayona. He has a bright future ahead of him if he sticks to making films like this.The acting is really good from everyone. It was a very honest and heartfelt performance from the cast. Ewan McGregor, Naomi Watts, Tom Holland, Samuel Joslin & Oaklee Pendergast star as the family. The children in the film also did a great job, which is hard seeing as all child actors are generally annoying and really bad at acting natural in front of a camera. But all 3 were brilliant.The only negative things I can say about this movie is it does not answer all the questions. You meet characters in the movie that are on a similar quest to find their family, but you never find out if they find them. I wanted to know I had to Google it afterwards and you can find the answers that way, but they should have included it in the movie.The other thing that I was a little bit disappointed about was the choice of actors yes, they did a brilliant job, but the family this film is based on is Spanish why do we need an actor from Scotland and an actress from Australia? Why couldn't they find decent Spanish actors and kept it more to the real story. I know all true stories have changes in them and made up bits, but this was one I thought was pointless.The emotions through this film is strong there are some very sad moments and some very happy moments. You really do get to connect with this family and the people they meet on the way. Not knowing if you family is dead or alive must be a horrible feeling and their search is so long. The film is a roller-coaster from beginning to end and it is a great ride to go on.I will give this film 8 out of 10.Possible the best natural disaster film ever made.'Go help people. You're good at it.'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",8,0,3,23 August 2013
Public Enemies," Good film.
","PUBLIC ENEMIES.I enjoyed it.I have been wanting to see this for a while now. I am a Johnny Depp fan and a Christian Bale fan.The movie is about a notorious bank robber named John Dillinger, played by Johnny Depp. There are only 2 things he loves, his girlfriend Billie, and robbing banks. Christian Bale plays an FBI agent who is determined to catch Dillinger.The movie has some really good action scenes in it. I love the bank robberies and I also love the scenes where he tries to escape from prison. This movie is set in the 30s and has that old fashioned feel to it.It is not Johnny Depps best film in my opinion, i prefer the ones where he is made up not to look like himself... but it does make a nice change to actually see his face on the screen.I thought Christian Bale could have been in it more. He does not have anywhere as much screen time as I had hoped. Also, he is speaking in a strong accent and I struggled to understand some of the lines he said. But this does not ruin the movie too much.I remember thinking while watching Public Enemies how in a small way it has a similarity to Natural Born Killers. Mickey & Malory Knox were murderers on the run but the general public grew to love them anyway and were cheering for them to escape the police. The same thing happens here... Dillinger was robbing banks and shooting his gun all over town, but he was loved by most of the public. They protected him.I give this film a 7 out of 10.Great movie, but like all bio pics, how much of it is true?For more of my reviews please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?fref=ts",7,0,0,23 November 2012
The Other Boleyn Girl," Surprisingly good
","THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRLI was pleasantly surprised with this film. It was very good... I got given this film on DVD for Christmas and I decided to watch it with my girlfriend last night... It is about King Henry. His wife, the Queen, loses their baby before it was born, and the king then goes away and finds a mistress. In a little town there is a family with 2 sisters and it is Natalie Portman who is chosen to be the mistress until she was blamed for an accident that the king had. He then turns to her sister for comfort, even though she is also married.It is a family fight between 2 sisters and their twisted family over a king and power.The acting is very good actually... Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson and Eric Bana were all very good.I felt the film made the King look very weak and thick. He seemed to let everyone else around him control what he was going to do. He seemed to be easily swayed on decisions by anyone.The only thing I can say about this film is it can be very slow in places, but not for long enough to get bored...I will give this film 7 out of 10.A very good drama that is worth seeing.For more of my normal reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,2,3,26 December 2012
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Better than I was expecting
","PRINCE OF PERSIA: THE SANDS OF TIMEI really enjoyed it. I didn't know it was a Disney film before watching it, but it was not really a typical Disney film. There was a lot more violence in it.I didn't really know what to expect from this movie, I had not seen any trailers... just a poster.The effects are not brilliant, but not bad either... you can see when it is computer simulated. The fighting scenes were really good... there were some really good sword fights. I especially liked the throwing knife fight.The acting was alright too. I wasn't sure about Jake Gyllenhaal being in it, but he did a good job. I like him really, I just haven't seen him in too much.It also had Ben Kingsley in it. I quite like him. Species is one of my favourite films with him in.The film is about a king who gets murdered and his son gets the blame so goes on the run. He gets hold of a dagger that has sand in the handle. If he presses the end of the handle, he travels back in time.I wish this movie had more time reversing in it. It looked quite good when they used the dagger, but i wish they used it more.I will give this movie 7 out of 10.It is a good movie... a lot better than I was expecting.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,0,0,7 February 2013
Ted," A funny movie
","TEDIt was good.It is typical toilet humour. A lot of swearing, getting high, hookers etc... Basically, it is what you would expect from Seth Macfarlane if you have seen Family Guy.The movie is about a little boy who gets a teddy bear for Christmas one year and wishes it would actually talk to him. On the night he wishes for this, a shooting star happens to shoot by in the sky... the next morning the bear is alive. 20 years later, the bear and the boy have grown up and are partying hard.The bear actually looks real through the whole movie. The effects are very good. I didn't notice Mark Wahlberg talking to himself at all... when he was talking to Ted, he was actually looking at him.There are some really funny moments in this movie, most of which are in the trailer. There are some other really funny parts that are not in the trailer though. I was just hoping there would be more. It is a laugh out loud comedy, but there could have been more which I am hoping will be in Ted 2, which I have read is going to be made soon.There are some great in jokes too... as well as some retro tunes (Knight Rider, naming one) and a classic guest star appearing in the form of Mr. Flash Gordon himself, Sam J. Jones.I will give this film 7 out of 10...A very funny film, but thought it was going to be funnier than it was.For more reviews, like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,0,1,17 December 2012
Oldboy," Awesome movie with a lot of twists...
","I thought the movie was really good... but I will watch it again to make sure I understand it completely. I get the main story of the movie, there are just a couple of things about it that I feel I didn't get an answer for.It is about a man who gets kidnapped the day of his daughters third birthday, and wakes up locked in a hotel room... his captors keep him there for 15 years and then just let him go. He now goes out to find out who stole 15 years of his life and why.It is a controversial film with some scenes that will stick in your mind. The story is really good and the cast were really good.This film was made in Korea and is spoken in Korean with English subtitles.Apparently it is part 2 of a trilogy, but I didn't know that when I watched it and it didn't ruin it for me... but it does make me want to watch the whole trilogy.The whole film kept me guessing and wondering what was happening and why he was kidnapped etc... when I got to the end of the movie I was shocked. It was a really good twist ending to a movie. I recommend this film to anyone who likes thrillers and doesn't mind subtitles.I give this film a 7 out of 10... the rating might be higher when I watch it again though.Plus, there is a live Octopus being eaten too... gross! :)For more reviews check out my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,0,6,7 November 2012
Spider-Man 2," A sequel that matches the original.
","SPIDER-MAN 2This is the sequel to the successful Sam Raimi movie.The film continues 2 years after the original movie with Peter Parker now living in a flat on his own still protecting the city from the bad guys. His nemesis this time around is Doctor Octopus.It is very rare for a film to be better than the original movie or even be close, but this is easily as good as the original in my opinion. The story is really good and even though Spider-Man has an enemy in Doctor Octopus, this film concentrates a lot on the emotions he is going through and not just about the action. Peter is going through a lot of stress with life as Spider-Man. He is in love with a woman he can't be with, he can't hold a job down, he is failing his studies, his best friend is badgering him to find out who Spider-Man is because he wants revenge for his father and he is riddled with guilt because of the death of his uncle. I like the story in this as it shows that he is human and has emotions and you start to feel actually quite sorry for him as you see that even though being Spider-Man is cool, he is sacrificing a lot for the people.The action and effects are really good and it stays entertaining all the way through the film. There are some comedy moments which breaks up the emotion and it is well timed.The stars of the original movie returned for this. Tobey Maguire was Spider-Man, Kirsten Dunst played MJ and James Franco plays Harry Osbourne. Alfred Molina played Doctor Octopus. Toney did a good job playing a guy who was running out of emotional energy. He really did look like he was struggling with everything. James again did a brilliant job. He looked angry and played the part well. Alfred did a great job as Doctor Octopus. Even though he was the bad guy in the movie, he was also the victim. I felt sorry for his character. The cameos again were great in this Stan Lee and Bruce Campbell made appearances.There was one scene that I thought was rubbish. During once sequence Spider-Man was seen by a lot of people without his mask. They all tell him that they won't say anything and his identity was kept a secret I straight away thought this was rubbish. Someone would have spilt the beans for the right price and let's face it. The Bugle would have paid cash for that story. I enjoyed this a lot and thought it was a great sequel to the original.I will give this film 7 out of 10.'I'm back I'm back! WOOOOOHOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!! My back! Ouch, my back!'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,0,2,24 April 2014
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Pretty good...
","X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINEI am not a huge fan of the X-Men films... I do like them, but I think they could have been better.But this is a good film... this is the second time I have seen it now and I still really enjoyed it.Wolverine is such a cool character... he has an attitude about him that plays well on screen.The film is about the life of Wolverine before he joined the X-Men.You see him as a child and when he grows up. The rivalries and fights he gets in with a lot of people are good.The effects are good and the fighting scenes are impressive.There was a dodgy copy of this film going about when it first went into the cinema. It showed the film with the effects not finished.I only saw a little bit of it and it was weird seeing him jump around with wires attached... and seeing him slash things without any claws.It is so much better seeing the whole film completed.Hugh Jackman returns as Wolverine. He does play the part well... It was good to see his character when he was young.Liev Schreiber plays his brother who has a similar power to Wolverines, but not quite the same.It also has got Ryan Reynolds in and Will I Am... It is quite funny really, because when Will I Am speaks in the movie, he sounds like he is doing a bad Mr. T impression. Haha!I have never read the comics so didn't know the background of Wolverines character... it was good to see how the blades got inside of him.I will give this film 7 out of 10.Very enjoyable, and I would like to see the Origins of some of the other X-Men characters.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,0,2,1 February 2013
Troy," Not bad... but not great.
","TROYThis is an epic film. It is not really my kind of film, but I can understand why it is popular to other people. There were things about this film I loved, but there were also things I was not too keen on.The film is about the battle of Troy. The main character is Achilles played by Brad Pitt. The acting was really good and the film had a brilliant cast list. Starring in this film with Brad is Sean Bean, Julian Glover, Nathan Jones, Peter O'Toole, Eric Bana & Orlando Bloom Everyone does a great job.The story was quite good, but I felt it dragged on for too long. I was hoping it was going to be gripping throughout the movie, but there were times where I was getting a little bored. But just as I was getting bored, another fighting sequence came along.The fighting scenes were absolutely amazing. They were violent, gory and very well shot. I don't know how much of this film was computer effects and how many extras were used, but there were so many people during the fighting scenes that you didn't know where to look. It was action and excitement every time. Sometimes you could see that when the people were stabbing each other, they were missing by miles, but it was not very often and it didn't ruin the scene.My favourite scene in the whole film was when the king played by Peter O'Toole went into the enemy camp to get his sons body back. The conversation he had with Brad Pitt in his hut was very tense. I could sense the respect and tension between both characters, and even though they were only talking it was a very captivating scene and the best scene of the film. Both actors played that scene perfectly.I will give this film 6 out of 10.Good fight scenes and great dialogue, but it was too long and a little boring in places.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",6,1,1,1 July 2013
Just Go with It," I like this one...
","JUST GO WITH ITI have seen this before and I do like it. It is not Adam's best film, but it is still funny and entertaining.The movie is about a plastic surgeon who pretends to be married just to get girls. All goes well until he falls for a girl that he meets at a party, but then she finds the wedding ring in his pocket. He then tries to convince her that he is getting divorced, but when she wants to meet his soon to be ex wife he panics. So he persuades his receptionist to pretend to be his wife and then the comedy begins.It is a typical romantic comedy there is comedy right up until the end of the movie where it is all romance. The comedy is very good, but it has the typical Adam Sander feel to it, which is not a bad thing. Adam as always gives 100%. He is a great comedy actor, but unfortunately his recent movies are just nowhere near as good as his earlier ones. Grown Ups and Jack and Jill was average at best. In fact I was very disappointed with Jack and Jill, I just thought that was terrible.This movie also stars Jennifer Aniston. Jennifer is a typical romantic comedy actress. I am still waiting to see her actually challenge herself and take on a serious role. I think she might be OK with it, but until she gets out of the comedy rut, she will never be an Oscar winner. But putting that behind, I don't actually mind her. She is good at comedies, and she can be very funny at times. She does a good job in this, but it is not her best performance. Another great character was Eddie played by Nick Swardson. He was pretending most of the way through the film to be from Sweden (I think), but his fake accent and his character was hilarious. Especially when he tries to give CPR to a sheep. I was laughing so much. You have to see it.It was very good to see Nicole Kidman in this too. She has a very small role but she plays the character very well.The children in this movie were not too annoying either. I find children actors very irritating most of the time, but they were not too in your face. The girl, played by Bailee Madison, was slightly annoying, but that was because she was putting on a fake English accent throughout the whole movie. It started out funny, but after a while it lost its comedy value and I stopped laughing, I just wished she would stop talking. Too much of a good thing is never good. But generally not bad little actors. The boy was played by Griffin Gluck. He was quite good too. I believed he was a sad little kid who had Daddy issues.The story is not bad, the acting is not great but works very well with the comedy & the romance is not too over the top which is always good. I always find that with romantic comedies the romance kills the mood sometimes of the comedy because it is drawn out too long, but this movie is not too bad for that. There is a lot of fun to be had with a plastic surgeon in a comedy, and Adam knows how to make it funny. He goes to extremes to be funny with his ideas. He also seems a likable person which always helps to find him funny.I will give this film 7 out of 10.'Mommy! That man put his pee-pee on my face!'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:Ordinary person movie reviews",7,5,8,27 August 2013
Home Alone," Classic Christmas Comedy
","HOME ALONEThis is another classic Christmas film.I do think it has been over played over the years, but I can't help it. I love it at Christmas time. For me it was the start of this kind of movie that has now been ripped off a million times (Dunston Checks in, Baby's Day Out etc...).The acting is not particularly good, but with this kind of movie, it doesn't need to be.This is the film that made and probably destroyed Macaulay Culkin.The comedy is brilliant, Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are fantastic. They are so funny... they know how to take a fall and their faces are classic comedy.Classic Christmas songs are played through it too... it has a very good soundtrack and score.I probably don't need to write too much about this, as 99% of you have probably already seen it... more than once.I will give this film 8 out of 10.Great to watch at Christmas time... but there really should not have been any sequels... even thought part 2 was not that bad.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page: http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",8,0,0,26 December 2012
Spider-Man 3," Good... But not great.
","SPIDER-MAN 3The final chapter in this trilogy.The movie continues on from the second movie with Peter and MJ together, Harry angry with Peter and looking for revenge and 2 new villains on the loose.This was entertaining, but was disappointing compared to the other films.The story was actually not bad, but it seemed very stretched and there was a lot of things crammed into one movie.The rivalry between Harry and Peter was very interesting, but would have liked to see more. I thought Harry's anger towards Spider-Man was so strong that the Hob Goblin could have had a whole movie to himself. The other bad guys were not really needed. But, the Hob Goblin was not the main villain. Sandman was the main bad guy. The effects were quite good for him and I thought he looked great, but I feel he should have been more evil. The writers made him more of a victim than a bad guy.The other bad guy that made an appearance was Venom. Venom was my favourite character through the movie, I was just very disappointed that he had such little screen time. Especially as you have the posters with him all over. The scenes he was in were great though.There were a few things about this film I didn't like. It felt like this film was ripping off parts of other movies. At one point it reminded me of Superman 3. Spider-Man started changing into an evil version of himself. During this time, Peter walks around town dancing and thinking he is gods gift to women. This just didn't seem to fit into the movie at all. It took the atmosphere away from the story and added too much comedy to the film. It distracted us from the main story and point of the film. I know Peter was going through some changes, but it should have been done differently. Secondly, there is a scene where Peter is dancing with some girl to make MJ jealous. This is another scene which should have been left. Out. It looked like a scene from The Mask. It just didn't fit in this film.The effects and action sequences were very good. I really enjoyed them and thought they were as good as the other movies.The acting was as good too. The original cast returned. Toby Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco. All did so good job. Other cast members were Thomas Haden Church & Topher Grace. It was also good to see Bruce Campbell and Stan Lee back.OK, look... This is a good film, and I did like it... But the are a lot of things that were not so good. This is 2 films squeezed into 1 and it all feels a bit rushed.I will give this 6 out of 10.'You know... I guess one person really can make a difference. Nuff said!'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page.Ordinary person movie reviews.",6,0,0,13 May 2014
Snatch," A very funny film with great characters.
","SNATCHThis is one of those movies that I was never really interested in watching because I couldn't stand watching Brad Pitt. I was never a Brad Pitt fan... Until I made a deal with a friend of mine. He hates Tom Hanks, but I said he had to see Saving Private Ryan. He said he would watch it if I watched Fight Club. I watched Fight Club and loved it, he still needs to watch SPR... he is putting it off well. Since then I have grown to like Brad. He has made some great films.Anyway... back to Snatch.I thought it was brilliant. A great comedy with plenty of action. I really liked Lock Stock so am not really surprised that I liked this.The film is about a diamond... a big diamond that it seems everyone wants. I would say the main character is a guy called Turkish. He is a boxing promoter, and a dodgy one at that. He makes a deal and fixes a match for a very dangerous man named Brick Top. Turkish gets a pikey named Mickey to fight for him as he knocked out his prized fighter, but Mickey does not like to play by the rules. Whilst all this is happening, there is still the small matter of the diamond that is being killed for by a few people and are chasing it around London.The story is kind of all over the place, but it is great... it is not hard to follow and it has some great comedy moments in there. I was laughing at the situation and the reactions of the characters.The cast list is also very impressive. It stars Jason Statham, Benicio Del Toro, Dennis Farina, Vinnie Jones, Brad Pitt, Alan Ford and Mike Reid. Yes, that's right... Frank from Eastenders. Everyone acts great in here. It is a proper cockney gangster story with a comedy twist. But this is definitely what you would expect from a Guy Ritchie film. It is as good as Lock Stock.I will give this film 7 out of 10.Very funny and with some great characters.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,0,2,13 June 2013
Horrible Bosses," A really funny comedy.
","HORRIBLE BOSSESI saw this in the cinema and recently got it on DVD. I loved it just as much the second time as I did the first time.The movie is about three friends who really really hate their bosses for different reasons... so one day over a few drinks they decide to kill each others bosses... but all does not go smoothly for them.The story is great... I fully understand hating your boss, but these guys really go to extremes to get rid of them. It has a lot of twists and turns in the story that really are funny. I laughed out loud a lot through this movie. The writing was brilliant and the script was also really funny.The casting was spot on... Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis are the three hopeless friends. They were all brilliant in this film, but the star has to be Charlie Day. He was hilarious and easily had the best part in the movie. The three bosses were played by Jennifer Aniston, Colin Farrell and Kevin Spacey﻿. They were also brilliant. In fact I would say that this is probably one of Jennifer Anistons best roles to date. One of the best characters in the film was called MOTHERF****r Jones who was played by Jamie Foxx.I don't really have anything bad to say about this movie. I really like it and could gladly watch it again. It does make a change to have a comedy that makes me laugh out loud more than a couple of times... but these guys really work well together and seem to have a great working relationship.I will give this film 8 out of 10.'Why would you put his whole bathroom in your ass?'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",8,0,0,16 February 2014
The Polar Express," A fantastic Christmas movie.
","THE POLAR EXPRESSI love this movie... I watch it every Christmas.It is a great story of a kid who starts to disbelieve in Santa, until one Christmas eve a train pulls up outside his house, even though there are no train tracks, and takes him on an adventure on the way to the North Pole.The animation is really good and the voice acting was also good in most places. Tom Hanks plays about 3 or 4 people, but unfortunately, no matter how much he tries to change his voice, it is always going to sound like Tom Hanks.The colours and Christmassy scenes in the movie are beautiful. It is a very pretty film as well as entertaining.I will give this film 8 out of 10.You have to watch this with the kids at Christmas... or even on your own. :)For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",8,2,4,26 December 2012
Life of Pi," Amazing...
","LIFE OF PIThis is a movie I wanted to see in the cinema in 3D but never got round to it. After seeing the Blu-Ray, I can honestly say I am gutted I missed it.The movie tells the story of an Indian lad who was named after a swimming pool his name is Pi. His family, who owns a zoo, decides to move to Canada but on their long journey their boat hits a storm and sinks killing almost everyone on board. The movie is about Pi's fight for survival on a little life boat Not only does Pi have to find a way to survive being stranded in the middle of the ocean, but he is not alone. He is stuck in this small boat with an aggressive Bengal Tiger.The story is amazing it is very entertaining and full of excitement which surprised me seeing as 90% of the movie is set on a small boat. Before watching this I was thinking that this would be quite a slow movie and there would be parts that would be boring but there isn't. It really does keep you glued to your seat.Yes, the story Pi is telling is very unrealistic and when I watched it, a few times in the movie I was thinking that if this happened in real life he would be dead.Visually, this film is probably the best looking film I have ever seen. The images and scenery were amazing. All the way through the movie I was thinking (as a photographer) that I would love to be there with my camera. I have a photography website and there were so many images there that I wish were real so that I could go and visit and get some amazing shots. The colours were amazing, very vibrant and they jumped out from the screen. I could imagine that in 3D it would make the experience even more beautiful.The only thing negative I could say about this film would be that the effects were not always on form. Most of the time it was brilliant, but then every now and then you could see that the tiger was computer generated and not real. That goes for some of the other animals too. They just didn't look right in some scenes. They didn't move realistically.The casting was perfect. Suraj Sharma plays the main character. This was his first movie and I hope he gets a career out of this because he did a great job. The only famous face in the movie was Gerard Depardieu, but he only had a cameo.I will give this film 8 out of 10.Excellent effects, excellent action, excellent story, excellent acting.'Animals have souls...

Pacific Rim," Brain dead entertainment.
","PACIFIC RIMI have heard a lot of mixed reviews of this movie so I didn't really know whether I would like it or not. And after seeing it I can honestly say, it was very very average.The planet has been attacked by huge aliens, the only way we can fight them is by inventing massive robots.I know it's not much of a story line, but that is basically it. The story was very flat. There was no depth to the characters or the story itself. I thought it was actually quite boring.The film did have it's good moments though. The effects were amazing. The battle scenes were so good that I could not stop watching it. It was dark in places, but that didn't ruin the scenes. I thought the fighting was really well done. Also, the aliens looked awesome. They were very original looking and really looked horrible. I loved the way their mouths glowed blue. It really made them look good. Visually, it was an amazing film. It was a good looking movie.The movie starred Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi, Charlie Day & Max Martini. I am sorry to say that nobody really did a great job on this. I am not saying that the actors were fully to blame for this, but the characters were not easy to play because they had no personality.This film is worth watching if you don't think about it. If you just want to watch giant monsters fighting giant robots and just want a bit of good looking fun, then it is worth watching but don't try and find a deep plot because you won't find one.I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it.I will give this film 5 out of 10.'We can either sit here and do nothing or grab those flare guns and do something really stupid.'For more reviews please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",5,2,7,5 November 2013
The Godfather: Part II," Great story...
","THE GODFATHER PART IIThis was a good sequel... I can understand why there is a lot of debate over which movie is better, part 1 or 2. Personally I am sitting on the fence. Part 1 was a good film... I enjoyed it as you can read below... but part 2 was a better story.This film has 2 stories in it... the rise of Michael Corleone as the new mafia boss, and the other story is about Don Vito Corleone when he was young making his rise as the Godfather.The casting as before was brilliant. Al Pacino returned as Michael, and he played the part really well. Robert DeNiro played his father (a younger version) Don Vito Corleone. DeNiro was a fantastic choice to play the Godfather... he looked the part. I could imagine DeNiro growing old to look like Marlon Brando. Excellent stories.Again though, it was pretty slow paced during parts of the movie... it is such a long film. I don't think it needs to be that long. I know I say that a lot about films, but it's how i fell. I don't think that about all long movies... there are some movies that I love that are over 3 hours long... but these films felt long. It probably didn't help that I had to keep pausing this movie all the way through. I actually watched it in 2 halves because it was taking me so long.I will give this film a 7 out of 10... I know I gave part 1 the same mark, but they are 2 completely different films.Great story!For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,0,4,25 January 2013
Rush," A very good rivalry movie for anyone!
","RUSHI have been wanting to watch this movie ever since I saw the trailer. I missed it in the cinema, but now it has been released on DVD.The movie is about a rivalry between two Formula One drivers. This rivalry wasn't like other rivalries... these guys really took it to the edge. They disliked each other as well as wanted to beat each other... but they respected each other.The movie was very good. I am a big Formula One fan and have been for many years. I am not old enough to remember the Niki Lauda/James Hunt rivalry, but I have heard of it and seen video clips. Niki and James are both legends in their sport and will remain that way forever. Niki is still a presence at the track these days as he works as a consultant for the Mercedes team and can be seen at almost every race.The action in the movie was very good and the racing scenes were very well put together. Ron Howard really is good at making a great action film.The film stars Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl. Both actors did a fantastic job and it is amazing how much Chris and Daniel actually look like James and Niki. It really is the perfect casting.There are some scenes in the film that were a bit awkward to watch. When Niki had his accident he went through a really harsh time through his treatment. Some of which was really horrible to watch. Niki went through as really hard timer, yet he still got back in the car the same year to finish the season. That man is crazy! I have so much respect for him. He was very determined and focused for his passion.Niki was not a very likable person. He took his career very seriously and he didn't care who he had to walk over to get what he wanted. He didn't have many friends and he didn't care. He wanted to be world champion and that was all he focused on. Weirdly though, I really liked him. He was very blunt and said what he thought no matter who got upset. I like honesty in people and that is a very good thing in Nikis favour. James on the other hand was the complete opposite. He was a playboy. He liked women, drink and drugs. He was sometimes deemed dangerous in the car, but he had a talent and was very good at what he did. There were times through the film where I didn't really like James. I thought his attitude sucked and he wasn't a very nice man at times. In the end though I felt sorry for him. His life went off the rails a little bit and I thought he maybe deserved a little bit more help than he got from the people around him.According to Niki this film is very close to the truth, which is a very good to know. I hate the fact that most true stories are full of untrue parts.I don't really have anything bad to say about this film. You will enjoy this film if you do not like F1, but you will enjoy it more if you do. I don't think it is Rons best film, but it is up there with the best of his career.I will give this film 8 out of 10.'The closer you are to death, the more alive you feel. It's a wonderful way to live. It's the only way to drive.'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",8,2,3,10 February 2014
The Aviator," A great film about a very unusual man.
","THE AVIATORThis film is a biopic about Howard Hughes, the film director, producer, businessman and aviator.Howard had some problems in his life including an anxiety disorder. He was obsessed with hygiene and cleanliness of everything. He had to wash his hands every time he shook someones hand.The film is very interesting. I didn't really know much about Howard until I watched this. The story is gripping and interesting, his career and relationships with the people in his life was a roller-coaster.The casting was perfect in this film. Everyone played their characters brilliantly. Leonardo DiCaprio played Howard. He did a great job. I always hated Leonardo, but the more I watch if his work, the more I think he has a skill with acting. Other cast members are Cate Blanchett, Kate Beckinsale, John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin, Ian Holm, Gwen Stefani, Jude Law, Brent Spiner and Willem Dafoe. A few of these actors only made cameos, but they made their mark on the movie. I was surprised at how well Gwen Stefani acted. I am a fan of No Doubt and I know she can sing, but she is a talented actress too. I hope she makes more movies as I would like to see more of her work. Cate Blanchett played Katharine Hepburn... she was so annoying. I hope she wasn't like that in real life... she was really irritating the way she was and spoke.The way this film was shot was brilliant. Martin Scorsese does a great job again. The scene where Howard crashes his plane into the houses was absolutely immense. It looked amazing and was by far the best scene in the whole movie and even the best crash scene I think I have ever seen. That scene will stick in my mind for a very long time.I have never seen a Howard Hughes movie, but I will be looking out for one to see what it is like.I will give this film 7 out of 10.A very entertaining movie, but don't take it all as fact as all biopics are not 100% true.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,1,2,11 June 2013
Man of Steel," A great movie... I look forward to seeing more.
","MAN OF STEELThat was so much better than I thought it was going to be.I always thought this looked good by the trailer, but it blew me away.The film is a new beginning for Superman. This movie has nothing to do with the other 5 movies that have been made. You see the birth of Kal-El, the struggle with Jor-El and the planet Krypton and the fights they are having with General Zod. Then Kal-El's life here on Earth, trying to adapt to life with these powers that nobody else has... until Zod finds him and seeks to destroy Earth to rebuild Krypton.The film is full of action. the fighting sequences were amazing. In all of the recent super hero movies, when the fighting sequences are happening you can see that there has been some computer generated moments, but in this film I can honestly say that it was so well done that I didn't notice anything like that. It genuinely looked real.The acting was good throughout too... Henry Cavill plays Clark/Superman/Kal-El, Amy Adams plays Lois Lane, Michael Shannon plays General Zod, Diane Lane plays Martha Kent, Kevin Costner plays Jonathan Kent, Laurence Fishburne plays Perry White and Russell Crowe plays Jor- El.I have to say I don't agree with the complete casting on this film. Henry was a great Superman, Amy was a good Lois, but she was a completely different character than the Lois from the original films. She was more serious and less accident prone. Kevin Costner was not that bad as Jonathan Kent. I was a bit sceptical, but he was OK. I think the biggest mistake was Laurence Fishburne playing Perry White. Perry should always be a character that was hot headed, always shouting with a bad attitude... but Laurence played the part calmly. He needed to shout more. I would have thought Louis Gossett Jr. would have played it better. He knew how to shout.General Zod was brilliant. He has such an evil look about him. And the fighting scenes with him and Superman were fantastic. Another thing I liked about this film is Superman does not get to save everybody like he does in the original movies. People actually die. Superman is not super enough to be able to rescue them all... during the fighting and destruction of Metropolis, a lot of buildings get destroyed and there are explosions everywhere... it makes a change to see Superman slightly beatable in that aspect.There was a couple of things about this that I was not fond of too... but I don't want to put any spoilers in my reviews so I will let you watch it and see if there is anything you don't like about it and see if I agree. Nothing big, just a couple of little things that I thought should have been done differently.I will give this film 8 out of 10.A great start for a reboot... I look forward to seeing another one which I am sure they will make. This could be better than the recent Batman trilogy... and I am more of a Batman fan.For more reviews, please like my review page on Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",8,3,7,8 July 2013
Doctor Zhivago," A good movie, but very long.
","DOCTOR ZHIVAGOPhew... this film is a mission to get through!The movie tells the story of a doctor/poet. It spans through his life from childhood to his death.The film is on for over 3 hours, but I made the big mistake of watching it with a 2 year old around... there was a lot of pausing and a lot of noise. I did understand the film, but I have to admit that it was a nightmare to get through. It literally took me over 6 hours to watch!The story was harsh in places. He went through so much in his life that made him stronger. What I liked about this is he was not the perfect man. He made mistakes and paid for them.The story is very long, but it was entertaining. There were moments where I thought it was dragged out a bit. I know this is a classic but to be honest, it was not as good as I thought it was going to be. I didn't really know what to expect. I had not seen anything about this, apart from the fact it is widely known as a classic. I don't think it deserves to be called a classic, but it is a good movie.One of the great things about this film was the acting. The performances were really well done. The movie starred Omar Sharif as Yuri Zhivago. Omar did a brilliant job. His character was so full of feeling and emotion and that comes down to the fantastic job by Omar. Other great performances were done by Julie Christie, Geraldine Chaplin, Rod Steiger and Alec Guinness. I was a little disappointed that Alec wasn't in it more. I am a fan of his work and wished he had a bigger part.There are not many effects in this, but there are a couple of scenes with blood. The blood looked so fake. Some of the make up was really well done, but then on other parts it really let slip. But the film was made in 1965, so I don't expect it to have amazing effects. For it's time it was perfect. It had a good looking feel to it.I will give this film 6 out of 10. This is a perfect Sunday afternoon film, but my suggestion to anyone who wants to see it would be... make sure there is not a 2 year old around when it's on. It is such hard work.'They rode them down, Lara. Women and children, begging for bread. There will be no more 'peaceful' demonstrations.'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204",6,0,3,1 September 2014
American Beauty," Gret story, great film!
","American BEAUTYI loved it...This film to me was unknown. I had heard of it before and seen the poster before, but I never watched the trailer and didn't know anything about the story.The film is about a family... from the outside they look like a normal family, but behind closed doors, it is a very unhappy family. The husband and wife hardly talk, never have sex and basically hate each other. Their daughter hates her father and hardly talks to her mother. She also feels very left out and hardly has any friends. It is basically their lives and how it all falls apart.I felt it had a very Cohen Brothers feel to the movie, but they didn't have anything to do with it. It was directed by Sam Mendes.It stars Kevin Spacey as Lester, the husband. He does a fantastic job in his role. He was a great character. He becomes obsessed with his daughters best friend and tries to impress her. His wife is played by Annette Bening. She is great in this. Especially when she is breaking down and going mad. She really played the role well. Their daughter is played by Thora Birch. This was a perfect role for her. She has always got a moody looking face and seeing as this character hardly ever smiles it works very well. Her best friend is played by Mena Suvari, who is the girl all over the poster. She plays this high school cheerleader who flirts with Lester through the movie.The story was really good. There were some moments in the film I was not expecting which surprised me and some great comedy moments. This really is a film that made me laugh, but also had a serious tone.I will give this film 8 out of 10.A very good film with a great cast.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",8,0,2,12 January 2013
Salt," I really enjoyed this film.
","SALTWell... I was not expecting this to be that good.The movie is about a CIA agent who interrogates a suspected terrorist... but when the terrorist says there is a spy amongst the CIA and he names her... she goes on the run to try and clear her name.It is an action thriller and it delivers on both subjects. There is plenty of action, but not all of it was great. Yes it was entertaining but during some of the action sequences, it just felt too unrealistic. I know it is a movie and I know that it is not supposed to be real... but at points where you could see that the main character would not survive, it ruined it a little bit. Also, there was a scene where there was a huge car chase and a car crashes off of a bridge... someone climbs out of the car, undoes handcuffs and casually walks away without any of the 40 strong crowd even looking at her, let alone stop her.But the surprise factor was there... and it was done very well. I tried to predict what was going to happen... and I failed. It is a great film for keeping you guessing. There was only one part of the movie that I guessed correctly, and even that I was not sure about.The casting was brilliant... I can't fault anyone for their performances. Anjelina Jolie is the main character. I don't mind her, but I don't see her as the best actress in Hollywood like a lot of people do. She has made some fantastic movies though... and this in my opinion is one of her best. But I have to say I think the performance of the movie has to go to Liev Schreiber. This is by far the best performance he has done yet that I have seen. I mainly know him from the Scream movies which I love, and I have seen him in other things too... but he did a fantastic job in Salt.The main thing I was disappointed with was the ending... I was comfortable watching this movie and really enjoying it... but it felt like it was unfinished. Honestly, the action was about to carry on, then the credits started to role. I was so confused and gutted. Thankfully, there are rumours of a Salt 2 on the way... hopefully they will finish the story this time.All in all I loved this film. Yes there were things I was not too impressed with, but I was hooked from the beginning.I will give this film 8 out of 10.'How many more like you are there?'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",8,5,7,25 July 2013
We're the Millers," Very funny.
","WE'RE THE MILLERSAnother Jennifer Aniston comedy... Does anyone think she will try a serious role? I think she would be quite good at it... and no... Leprechaun does not count. haha.We're the millers is a comedy about a drug dealer who is forced into picking up a lot of drugs and smuggling it into America from Mexico. He thinks he will never gets away with it on his own so decides to get himself a fake family and pretend they are on vacation. He hires the dopey boy that lives in his apartment, a runaway girl that hangs out outside his place and his stripper neighbour that hates him. All goes well until they get some serious drug lord after them for stealing their stash.I liked it a lot actually... it was so much better than I thought it was going to be. But that was mostly because of the acting. The actors had some great lines and they had the timing down perfectly. The comedy was very funny and it was not a romantic comedy, so the romance was little which made the film better anyway.The movie stars Jennifer Aniston, Jason Sudeikis, Emma Roberts & Will Poulter. Everyone in this film had great lines and were good, funny characters. I am not sure they should have got Jennifer to play a stripper though. Yes she has a good body and she pulled it off well, but I still think she was a little too old to play a stripper. But then if they got someone younger, it would not have been as convincing for her to be the kids mother. It is a tricky part to cast. But she did a good job anyway. The funniest character though was Kenny, played by Will Poulter. Will has such a funny expression and has a great way of acting a bit dim. He was by far the funniest character and the film would not have been anywhere near as good if he was not cast in it. It is hard to believe he was the kid in Son of Rambow. I didn't even recognise him.The story was good, the comedy was good and the acting was good. If there was anything bad to say about it, I would say it is just another typical comedy. There were some very cheesy moments, and there was a bit of romance near the end... but that is to be expected these days in most comedies. It is not the best comedy I have ever seen, but it is still very entertaining and worth watching.I will give this film 7 out of 10.'This is not a smidge of pot! You got me moving enough weed to kill Willie Nelson, man!'https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,0,1,20 September 2013
Ender's Game," Not bad but not great.
","ENDERS GAMEI don't know what it is about sci fi films, but I love them. I love the idea of being in space, other planets, the idea of life in the universe. It is the perfect escapism for me.Ender Wiggin is a very smart kid who is believed to be the chosen one to end a war between the human race and aliens that want to wipe us out.The story is quite good, but I just thought that a film about a child being trained in killing aliens could have been a lot better. Ender just wasn't very convincing as a character. There were a few characters in this film that I thought were not very convincing. I didn't believe that this kid was as smart as he was made out to be. Then the bully character was just laughable. I think the casting and probably the story just didn't add up.The film has some pretty big stars in it. Harrison Ford makes his way back to science fiction films after a long period away... And seeing as he has signed up for the next instalment of the eagerly anticipated Star Wars saga, it seems he is hanging around sci fi for a while. You never know... That rumour of a sequel to Blade Runner might actually come. Harrison was probably the best actor in the film, but he should have been in it more in my opinion. The film also has Ben Kingsley in it... Ben has a relatively small role, but he is memorable in it. The main cast were Asa Butterfield﻿, Hailee Steinfeld﻿ & Abigail Breslin. Asa was not great. I thought in some scenes he was OK, but generally he did not pull this character off. Hailee did a good job. I thought she was he best actress in the film (next to Harrison and Ben).The thing I loved about this film the most was the visuals. It was an amazing looking movie. I loved the scenery and the effects. It was all done brilliantly. It made me feel that I wanted to be up there. It looked beautiful.The ending was really good. I thought it was really well done and I did not expect the ending like that. The ending was actually worth waiting for.Not a bad film, could have been a lot better, but visually it is worth watching.I will give this 6 out of 10.'Your mother cheated, that's why you look like a plumber.'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:Ordinary Person Movie Reviews",6,2,3,28 July 2014
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," A very nice surprise...
","HANSEL AND GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERSI was fully expecting this to be a disappointment just like Red Riding Hood but I could not have been more surprised. This was such a great film I loved it!Hansel & Gretel kick some serious butt in the movie.The film had such a strong start, that I thought that it was going to be one of those films that has a strong start to get you hooked and then slow down and be a bit dull throughout but it was full on action through most of the movie. And even when it was not fighting scenes and magic, it was a good story too.The characters were amazing I actually grew to like Hansel & Gretel their relationship was so strong as brother and sister that you could see they were there for each other all the way through (mostly).Also, there was a fantastic character named Edward. He was a huge ogre that was being controlled by witches.He was such an awesome character.One of the things I really liked about this movie is it looked like there was not much CGI it felt like a classic old movie because of the effects they used but it was not a bad attempt at the effects. Everything looked great.Edward, for instance, looked like he was made of animatronics.The magic was obviously CGI, but looked really good also.The acting was really good the movie stars Jeremy Renner as Hansel and Gemma Arterton as Gretel.Famke Janssen played the lead witch Muriel.Everyone in the movie did a great job.Hansel & Gretel might be a fairy tale, but whatever you do, don't let your kids watch this.It is really adult orientated. The language is full on there are a lot of obscenities and even some nudity also the violence it gory. There is a lot of blood. I loved the way some of the people died in this film it felt like a great horror film.I will give this film 8 out of 10.A great surprise and I can't wait to see it again.For more movie reviews, please check out my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",8,1,2,20 May 2013
Spider-Man," A lot of fun and a good film to watch.
","SPIDER-MANThis is the original Sam Raimi version.The movie is about a school student and photographer who gets bitten by a spider and develops special powers like a spider. His nemesis in this is the Green Goblin.I like this film I know the Sam Raimi version got slated by a lot of people, but the films were a lot of fun. The feel of this film is very comic book. But that is what I like about it. I felt that with the latest Batman trilogy they took the comic feel away from it and made it into a very dark, realistic feeling movie I loved it, but I still preferred the Tim Burton version of Batman because it still had the comic book feel.The effects are not too bad, but at time you can tell that there are a lot of computer generated moments, especially when Peter is sunning along the roof tops.The casting was quite good, but I thought there were some lines and scenes where they delivered the lines so badly. Especially MJs facial expressions at times I have to admit, I did laugh at it. Tobey Maguire plays Peter Parker/Spider-Man. He does a great job. I think he is a good actor, but haven't really seen him in much else. Kirsten Dunst plays MJ. Kirsten is a very good actress, but this is not her best work. She has times where she is very convincing, but other times she was quite bad. James Franco plays Peters best friend, Harry. James has grown in leaps and bounds he was good in this film. I understand completely why he is as big now as he is. The Green Goblin is played by Willem Defoe... he is an excellent choice for this role. He has the perfect facial expressions for the part and does a brilliant creepy performance. I also really like the cameo appearances from some famous faces Stan Lee, WWF Superstar, the late great Macho Man Randy Savage and the legend that is Bruce Campbell.There were parts of this movie that I thought were ridiculous. It just didn't make sense. Peter gets bitten by a spider, it swells up so badly and he feels really ill so instead of going to the doctor or hospital he goes home to bed? Really? No-one would ever do this! I also thought it was really funny how MJ was so confused all the way through the movie she was so immature for her age. She starts the movie by dating the school meathead, then starts dating Harry, then she has a school girl crush on Spider-Man and then ends the movie telling Peter that she loves him Blimey, get a grip woman! It seems that she has no clue as to what love is.This film is a great movie which I will watch again and again. Sam Raimi has done a good job with it and I love the way the whole film feels. A nice little finishing touch was right at the end of the credits you get to hear the classic Spider-Man theme tune! Awesome!I will give this film 7 out of 10.'With great power, comes great responsibility'",7,0,1,17 April 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man," Good film, but should not have been made yet!
","I enjoyed this film. But, I still think it was too soon for a reboot. It feels like the Sam Raimi versions were only just out, why did this need a reboot? I enjoyed the Sam Raimi versions... yes... even Spider-Man 3. :)This movie starts the whole story over again... Peter Parker, a normal kid who is bullied in school and gets bitten by a spider. You should all know the rest.The story was good, the acting was good, but I didn't really connect with the characters as I did in the last ones. The effects were really good as were the action scenes. But I was thinking that I am not sure he could have made that Spider suit that well himself.The actors are good. Andrew Garfield does play a good Peter Parker.He looks more the part, but for some reason I preferred Toby Maguire. Emma Stone as his love interest was OK, but I am sure they could have found someone more fitting to the role. Rhys Ifans plays The Lizard which was a great villain. He, like always, does a great job... Then you have the supporting cast which has some great names involved. Sally Field, Martin Sheen and Denis Leary.I will give this film a 7 out of 10.Really good movie, but it should not have been made for another 20 years or so.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,1,2,9 December 2012
Tropic Thunder," I like this...
","TROPIC THUNDERI had seen this when it first came out and I was very disappointed with it. I remember it being not very funny, and all the funny bits were in the trailer. Now after a few years, I decided to watch it againÂ… I really liked it.The movie is about a bunch of actors who are shooting a war movie called Tropic Thunder. The whole shoot is a disasterÂ… so the director decides to end them to Vietnam to shoot the movie in the real jungle. Everything sounds like it will make a good movie until they get attacked upon by a group of drug dealersÂ… but the actors think it's all part of the movie! It is a comedy, and there are some very funny moments in the film. I love the use of languageÂ… it is executed so well.The actors do a great jobÂ… even the ones I don't like did really well. Tropic Thunder stars Ben Stiller (who also directed it), Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr. & Anthony Ruivivar. I quite like Ben Stiller. He has made some very good films, but in general he can be a little bit annoying. But he was very funny in this film. Jack Black is an actor that I am not very keen on. I think he is over the top and very annoying, but he has also made some good movies. I just don't really like his acting styleÂ… but again, in this he did a very good job and was not annoying at all. He was actually funny. I am a big Robert Downey Jr. fanÂ… I think he has made some amazing movies and plays all the roles with passion and really does a great jobÂ… especially in Natural Born Killers. Finally, Anthony RuivivarÂ… I don't think I have seen anything with him in before. He was very funny and really fit in well with the other actors.There were a lot of other famous faces that had smaller roles, but really made their mark in the movie. Matthew McConaughey played Bens agentÂ… he was not in the movie a lot, but was still funny. Nick Nolte plays an ex Vietnam veteran, whose life story is what the film is aboutÂ… Nick has gone off of the rails, but he really is a good actor and it was good to see him in this. I hope to see him in more in the future. Steve Coogan plays the movies director. Steve is another actor that annoys me a little bit. I just don't find the man funny. He was not that bad in this. But the best character for me was definitely Les GrossmanÂ… played by Tom Cruise! The thing I love about Tom is he can play any kind of character. He doesn't normally play comedy roles, but when he does he is so funny. Especially his dance. His character in this was hilarious. He had some of the best lines in the movie and he delivered them perfectly. I was crying with laughter when he was on the screen. There were quite a few other famous faces that had cameos in the movieÂ… but if you have not seen it, it is more fun trying to spot them. Good luck.The beginning of the movie was brilliantÂ… at first I thought I pressed the wrong button on my DVD player. I pressed play and a load of movie trailers started playing. They are fake trailers for the movie, but they were really well made. It was a great way and a different way to start a movie. Very unique and entertaining.The story is very good, the acting is very good and the comedy is outrageous in places but funny.I will give this film 7 out of 10.'I don't read the script, script reads me.'For more reviews, please check out my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,0,0,9 September 2013
Die Hard 2," A worthy sequel.
","DIE HARD 2Bruce Willis is back as John McClane. Life after the terrorist attack on the Nakatomi building has not been better for Detective McClane. He is happy with his wife, his job is going well and he is happy but when he goes to the airport to pick his wife up, things just don't seem right. John sees a couple of men looking very suspicious when police officers walk past them little does John know that following them would mean that he is stumbling across a big terrorist takeover at the airport. It is now down to John again to stop the terrorists that plan on crashing a lot of planes to get what they want.This film is a good movie but nowhere near as good as the original. It is a lot of fun, but it is a hell of a coincidence that John just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time again!The action in this movie is great. Again, like the first film there are some great fighting scenes and shoot ups. The explosions are not very realistic. You can see that a lot of them are pasted onto the backgrounds with computers especially the scene where John uses an ejector seat to get out of a plane that is about to explode. It looks bad but I can imagine that back in 1990 when the movie was made it looked great. I still like the bad effects though to be honest. It gives it a nice retro feel to the movie.The acting is as good as the first film with a lot of characters making the crossover from the original. Bruce Willis returns as John, his wife is again played by Bonnie Bedelia. William Atherton is also back as the slimy reporter and yes, he is as annoying in this as he was in the first. Reginald VelJohnson makes a nice little cameo as Johns partner from the first film, Al. And we have some new cast members for the sequel. William Sadler plays the main villain Col. Stewart. William is an evil looking bloke. He does a great job as a bad guy. He has a very cold stare. John Amos also has a great role in this film as the 'take no prisoners' soldier Maj. Grant. John does a great job. I mainly know John from Coming to America where he is so funny but in this he plays a bad ass that takes no trouble. He does it very well and is one of my favourite characters in the film.There are some classic comedy lines in this film, again mimicking the original and Bruce says his catchphrase right at the end let's face it though, everyone is waiting for him to say 'Yippie-Kai-Yay, Mother fu' and when he says it, you can't help but smile. The other thing I like about his character is no matter how much trouble he is in, he always seems to manage to be funny. His sarcasm is brilliant.The film is again set at Christmas time, which makes it feel like a Christmas movie even though you don't get to see Santa anywhere. Why does John always get himself in this kind of trouble at this time of year? The good news is in Die Hard 3, it is the summer time.This is a worthy sequel and is a great addition to the franchise. If you liked the first one then you should like this one.I will give this film 7 out of 10.'And where do we get those big portable lights? Borrow them from Batman?'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204",7,0,1,9 January 2014
Dirty Dancing," A classic.
","DIRTY DANCINGA romance film... Not my sort of movie, but there is no denying that this is a classic.The movie is about a girl who goes on holiday with her family. There she meets a group of dancers. She finds out that one of the dancers is in trouble and decides to help. To help she needs to learn to dance professionally. Whilst learning, she falls in love with her teacher and they have to hide their affair as he would get fired and she would be in a lot of trouble with her family.The film stars the late great Patrick Swayze. Patrick was such a good actor. He made so many great movies and even acted towards the end of his life in the TV show The Beast even though he was in a lot of pain. He is in my top 5 actors of all time and he is missed. Dirty Dancing is one of his biggest movies. The man knew how to dance well and he really shows it in this movie. Jennifer Grey played the girl in the movie. Jennifer is a good actress and she played this part well. She has been in a lot of movies and TV shows, but she will always mainly be famous for this film.The soundtrack to this movie is one of the strongest draws to this film. It is a near perfect soundtrack. It has a lot of great songs in it and it is made all the better by the song called She's Like The Wind which is sang by Patrick Swayze himself.The story itself is actually quite weak. It is a love story that has no deep meaning other than a holiday romance. Normally it would not be a good story for a film... But it works because of all the elements that work well together.I really like this film. I watched it a lot when I was younger as it was one of the first VHS I owned. It is a classic that I liked now as much as I did. But I can imagine that I wouldn't like it as much if it was the first time I saw it.I will give this film 8 out of 10.'I carried a watermelon.'For more reviews please like my Facebook page.Ordinary Person Movie Reviews",8,0,0,11 August 2014
District 9," A really entertaining movie. Must see.
","DISTRICT 9This is a really good movie.The film is about a species of alien that has come to Earth but they can't get back to their own planet. The humans are mistreating them and keeping them locked in their own area called District 9. When the humans decide to move the aliens to another area, they send in a group of people to evict them. The leader if this group gets sprayed with some black liquid and then seems very ill. All of a sudden he is being hunted by the humans. He has to ask the aliens for help.What I love about this film is the way it is shot. The first half of the film is shot like it is a reality show. A camera crew follow the eviction team around and it is shot like a documentary. It's not until the main character is on the run where it gets shot like a movie.The effects are great. The aliens look really good. You really dislike them at first, but the more the movie goes on the more you grow to like some of the aliens and hate the way they are being mistreated. I love the little child alien... he is so sweet.As the film goes on you start to really feel sorry for the guy that is on the run even though at the beginning he seems like a douche.Another thing I love about this film is the setting. It makes a change for an alien invasion film not to take place in America or the UK. Instead this time they have come down over South Africa.The action and violence is brilliant. The alien weaponry are awesome. The humans literally explode... it looks great and is really well done.The acting is good throughout. The stars of the movie are Sharlto Copley, Jason Cope and Nathalie Boltt. But the stars of the film have to be the aliens.This film is a lot of fun and if you have not seen it I suggest getting it ASAP.I will give this film 8 out of 10.'Get your fokkin' tentacle out of my face!'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",8,1,2,6 May 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," A good movie, but unfortunately pointless.
","THE HOBBIT: DESOLATION OF SMAUGPart 2 of the pointless trilogy.The movie continues on from the original one where Bilbo Baggins goes on an adventure with Gandalf and a group of dwarfs... they are heading towards a mountain which homes a very dangerous dragon.The movie is made very well. The effects are again very good much like the original movie... and you can tell Peter Jackson made this just by watching it. It has the same feel to it as the Lord of the Rings trilogy.What I love about the film the most is the fantasy element. The creatures look amazing and really does drag you into their world. It is a great form of escapism. The dragon, Smaug, was amazing. He looked really good and huge. I was very impressed with the effects.The acting again was brilliant. These movies really have been cast so well, I can imagine this Bilbo growing old into the Bilbo at the beginning of LOTR. The movie stars Martin Freeman as Bilbo. It is great that Hollywood is starting to really see the potential in some of the better British comedy TV stars. Some of them really does deserve a shot at the big time... and Martin is one of them. Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf. Ian is a legendary actor and can be very intimidating in places. He is the perfect Gandalf... it is hard to imagine anyone else playing him. Other cast members were Richard Armitage, Ken Scott, Graham McTavish, William Kircher, James Nesbitt, Stephen Hunter, Dean O'Gorman... the list goes on and on.I suppose the main thing I have against this film is the whole point. I loved the Lord of the Rings movies and you had 3 very long movies to cover 3 very big books... that I understand. Why must Peter Jackson and the greedy movie industry make the Hobbit into 3 long movies for 1 small book? The movie has a lot of filler in it that the book does not have. I liked the book a lot and was happy that Peter Jackson was making it... but I am disappointed that it is a long trilogy. It seems a waste.My favourite bit in the film though was the barrel scene. If you have seen it or read the book you know what bit I am talking about... it was really well shot and a lot of fun and action. By far the best scene of the film.I will give this film 7 out of 10. It is very good, but not as good as LOTR.'If this is to end in fire, then we will all burn together!'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,2,4,18 January 2014
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Good story and well acted... but too long.
","THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD  I was expecting to like this film, but not love it... and that is  exactly how it was. It was good, but not great.  The story is in the title... it is the story of the outlaw Jesse James  as told by the man who killed him.  The story is really good, but it was stretched out in places. This film  could have been 2 hours long and it would have been just as good... but  instead it was on for 3 hours. There were a few bits of the story that  I thought didn't need to be in there.  It was very interesting to see how Robert Ford killed him... and if he  did kill him the way they said in the movie... he is a coward. Back  when the film was set, it was the done thing to make sure you are face  to face... but Jesse James was shot in the back.  The film stars Brad Pitt as Jesse James, Casey Affleck as Robert Ford,  Sam Rockwell & Jeremy Renner. The acting was really good... I liked  Brad Pitt in this. He did a great job, but the best performance was  Casey Affleck. He really played a dodgy character. He was not likable  at all throughout the movie.  The scenes where someone was killed was really well shot. The camera  angles and the effects were really good.  I will give this film 6 out of 10.  A good story and entertaining, but too long and stretched out.",6,0,1,8 July 2013
Wreck-It Ralph," Another great Disney film. I loved it.
","WRECK-IT RALPHIt was really good.Disney seems to be on form at the moment. Wreck-It Ralph was a lot of fun, and seeing as I am an 80's boy... it was great to see some of the super retro characters on the screen.When I was a kid I loved playing Mario, Sonic, Street Fighter etc... and a lot of the characters from those games and more appear in this movie.Ralph is the bad guy from the arcade game Fix it Felix. But when the arcade closes at night and all the games close down... the characters come to life. Ralph is sick and tired of being a bad guy and wants to be a good guy. He feels like all the other characters from his game hate him and he just wants to be accepted. Ralph seems to think that if he gets a medal, he will become popular, so he crashes another game to get a medal... and the adventure begins.The story is genius. I thought it was very imaginative. The characters were great and likable.It is also very colourful. I watched this film with my girlfriend, my 12 year old daughter and my 7 month old daughter. My little girl was even glued to the movie for over an hour... until she fell asleep... but I doubt it was the film that sent her to sleep... it was just past her bedtime. :) hahaWIR is not as good as some of the classic Disney films, but it is a great film.I will give this film 8 out of 10.A very good movie, and I hope Disney can keep up the good work.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",8,2,3,24 March 2013
Bridesmaids," Better than I thought it was going to be.
","BRIDESMAIDSThis was actually better than I was expecting. I was thinking it was just going to be another romantic comedy that is only slightly funny... well, it was quite funny.The story is about a woman who is getting married, and when she gets her best friend to be maid of honour, one of her bridesmaids decides to try and outdo her and steal her best friend away from her. It then turns into a competition between these 2 women.The comedy is actually quite funny. There were a few moments that made me laugh out loud. The relationship between these women worked really well. All the cast gelled well and worked well together. The movie stars Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne, Melissa McCarthy, Wendi McLendon-Covey, Ellie Kemper, Chris O'Dowd & Jill Clayburgh. It was also good to see a couple of maneos in there. Matt Lucas and Terry Crews popped up in there.There were a few moments that were really gross... but they were really funny. The language used as well felt like it was there for shock value, and that was not really necessary.All in all, I enjoyed it. It was far better than expected and it is not as romantic as it sounds like. It really is just about these women trying to get along.I will give this film 7 out of 10.'This is so awkward. I really want you to leave, but I don't know how to say it without sounding like a d*ck.'For more reviews, please like my facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,0,2,18 August 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Good film but too long
","THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEYI am a fan of the Lord of the Rings movies... I have never read the books though. When I heard this movie was being made, I made it my mission to read the book before the film came out.The book is awesome... I loved it. The movie is also very good, but there are bits I am disappointed with.I think the film is a really good movie, but there is absolutely no need to stretch it out into a trilogy. I know in Hollywood it's all about the money... but this story does feel very stretched. The book of the Hobbit is about a third in length of Fellowship of the Ring, so surely it should only be one movie?!?The thing with Peter Jackson in my opinion is his movies are too long. He makes some amazing films, but they are too long for my liking. King Kong for instance is a really good movie, but the first 90 minutes really should have only been 25 minutes of the movie.The Hobbit is a really good film. The effects are great, the story is great and the characters are really good... especially Gollum.I felt that the beginning of the movie was very good, the ending was very good but the middle was very stretched out. I thought the middle slowed down a little bit too much and should have been shorter.The way the movie ended makes me wonder how they could stretch it out into 2 more movies though... they got quite far in their journey in the first movie alone.The casting was brilliant. Martin Freeman plays a really good Bilbo Baggins. He looks like he could get older and look like Ian Holm. It was also very good to see some of the old cast from LOTR back to reprise their roles in this... Elijah Wood made an appearance. It was also good to see the legend that is Christopher Lee back.I really did enjoy this film and will give it 8 out of 10...I can't wait for The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",8,3,6,17 January 2013
Zulu," Not as good as it should have been.
","ZULUWhat a disappointment. I was thinking this was going to be such a good film... everyone I have spoken to says this is a good film and a classic... but I just thought it was average at best.The film is about a group of British soldiers who are at war with Zulu warriors... but the British solders are greatly outnumbered.The story was very weak. It could have been so much better. The first half of the movie was very slow... not a lot happened and it was just the build up to the big battle that went on through the second half.The big fight scenes were good. I enjoyed them, but the acting was terrible. When someone got shot or stabbed it was so badly done that you could see that they were not even being touched. The blades were fake and when a man had a giant hammer, you could see it was made of foam as it kept bouncing and bending.The film stars Stanley Baker, Jack Hawkins, Ulla Jacobsson, James Booth and Michael Caine. There were some good performances at some points in the movie, but in general it was not very convincing.The second half of this film was fun to watch, but they didn't need the first half to be that long.I will give this film 5 out of 10.I was expecting more so was very disappointed.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",5,3,13,17 June 2013
1941," Such a shame!
","1941What can I say about this? Not a lot I am afraid.The movie is a war comedy set a few days after Pearl Harbor. a town is getting ready for an attack from the Japanese, but all in comedy fashion.Everything that this film had going for it really should have made this a fantastic film. Directed by Steven Spielberg, written by Robert Zemeckis, music by John Williams, the film stars John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, John Candy, Ned Beatty and Christopher Lee... sounds like the perfect team right? Wrong!This film was just not funny. There were a few moments which made me chuckle a little bit, but to be honest it was just all over the place. One minute the story is about getting ready for an invasion, the next minute it is a love story about a guy who is not in the army, then it is a fetish movie about a woman who loves planes and will only go that step further with this guy if they are up in the air... honestly, I didn't get it. I really wanted to, but I was just thinking this would be far funnier than it ever was.The characters seemed to have no connection together. I have no idea what John Belushi was doing through the movie. He was just on his own in the air for most of the film flying around.I can't complain about the acting in general. As always Aykroyd, Belushi, Candy, Lee and Beatty did a good job. I just think they agreed to the wrong movie. It was badly written and a lot of it was set at night so it was very dark and hard to see. I will give this film 3 out of 10.It is such a shame because I am a fan of everyone that is involved.'You know, this year wasn't the big year of the war, '41. I think the really big year is going to be 1942.'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204",3,3,5,27 November 2013
The Little Mermaid," A complete classic... one of the best.
","THE LITTLE MERMAIDThis is one of my favourite Disney films.The movie is about a mermaid princess who dreams of exploring outside of the ocean. One day she saves a human prince from drowning and she falls in love. The problem is, she is a mermaid... so she signs a deal with an evil witch to change her into a human for 3 days. She now has a race against timer and has 3 days to make the prince fall in love with her, otherwise she becomes one of the witches weeds.The story is great and there are so many great characters in this film. Ariel is the main mermaid that falls in love with Prince Eric. Her friends are there to help her through her adventure though. Flounder is her little fishy friend, Sebastian is her crab friend and Scuttle is her seagull friend. Sebastian is my favourite character in the whole film. He is so funny... but then so is Scuttle.This is pretty much what you would expect from a Disney cartoon. It is a complete classic and is up near the top of the list in my mind near Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King.What I liked about this too is they didn't use famous names to sell it. I have never heard of any of the people who did voices for this movie. Jodi Benson, Christopher Daniel Barnes, Jason Marin, Buddy Hackett, Samuel E. Wright and Pat Carroll do the voices of the main characters.This film is full of adventure, love and music. The songs are very catchy and you can't help but tap your feet along to the classic songs Under the Sea and Kiss the Girl.This really is one of the best, and it is made even better because it was drawn and not computer animated. I always did prefer the drawn cartoons.I will give this film 8 out of 10.'Somebody's got to nail that girl's fins to the floor.'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",8,2,2,10 March 2014
JFK," An interesting film, but is on for far too long.
","JFKWow... this film was a mission to get through.It was good, but way too long. It was on for just over 3 hours... but it really did feel like it was longer.The movie is about the assassination of the former president John F. Kennedy. What I really liked about this film was the fact that they used real footage of JFK. There were no actors playing him, it was actually him. He got shot right at the beginning of the movie, and then the rest of the movie was about District Attorney Jim Garrison, who believes that Lee Harvey Oswald was used as a patsy and Kennedy was shot by someone else. It then turns into a court drama.I did like it, and it was very interesting, but it just seemed to be a very slow going movie.There were some fantastic performances though. The cast list was amazing in this movie. Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldman, Joe Pesci, Kevin Bacon, Jack Lemmon, Sissy Spacek, Walter Matthau, Donald Sutherland, John Candy, Michael Rooker & Wayne Knight.The film was made by Oliver Stone. The man is a legend and knows how to make a great film.The make-up was not so good... Joe Pesci looked terrible. He was wearing a really bad wig and huge fake eyebrows. But later in the film, you see they are supposed to be bad. Tommy Lee Jones' wig though was hilarious. I couldn't help but laugh when I first saw him. I wasn't expecting John Candy to be in it... I was pleasantly surprised. He was a great actor and he made so many classic movies. He is still missed now.I didn't know much about the JFK assassination when I watched this. I obviously knew about the conspiracy behind it all and the grassy knoll. But I didn't know much details. This really interested me in the movie and made me want to look into it a bit more. It is one of those mysteries that probably will never be solved.I will give this film 6 out of 10.It would get a higher mark it if wasn't on for so long... It did not need to be that long and it ruined it a little bit for me.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",6,1,8,24 June 2013
Django Unchained," Another great Tarantino film
","DJANGO UNCHAINEDI am a big Tarantino fan... he has made some films I didn't like too much, but generally his movies are great. This is no exception. It is a good movie.I had heard so many people say this film was the best Tarantino film they had seen... I disagree. It is nowhere near in the same league as Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs.The film is about a bounty hunter who is looking for his latest bounty. He does not know what they look like so he finds Django. He knows that Django knows what they look like. Django is a slave. But when the bounty hunter sees what talent Django has, he makes him a deal... If he frees Django and Django helps him hunt, the bounty hunter will help him find his wife and free her too.The films stars Christoph Waltz, Jamie Foxx, Leonardo DiCaprio & Samuel L. Jackson. Everyone does a great job... they were all believable in their roles.This film is set back in the day when slaves were legal. It was such a racist time and you can really tell when watching this.There is the typical amount of violence for a Quentin Tarantino movie... but I love that. It would not be a Tarantino film unless there was a decent about of blood.The film is quite long... it is on for 2 hours 45 minutes... but I didn't mind in this film as it was entertaining from beginning to end.My favourite character was Stephen who was played by Samuel L. Jackson. He played the part so well that I hated him. I hated DiCaprio too... but Jackson did an outstanding performance.The other great thing was the brilliant little appearance from Quentin Tarantino himself. I am glad he was in the movie... i think it really cements a Tarantino film.I will give this film 7 out of 10.Again Tarantino delivers another great movie.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,1,4,28 April 2013
Bolt," Another awesome Disney film.
","BOLTI am a huge Disney fan... but had never seen this one before.It did not disappoint... I loved it.It is about a dog who is an actor in a TV show, but he doesn't know he is acting. He believes everything that is happening and even believes he has super powers... until he escapes the set to rescue his owner and discovers he is a normal dog.The story was really good, pretty much a typical Disney film. It had action, adventure, sadness, happiness and fun! The only thing this film didn't have which is always expected from a Disney film was songs... there were no singing and dancing in this film at all.The voices were provided by John Travolta and Miley Cyrus. I couldn't actually tell if Miley was the voice of a cat or the little girl. But John Travoltas voice is unforgettable. You knew his voice as soon as his character spoke.This is a great Disney film, but it is not as good as a lot of the other classics. Disney lost it's touch a little bit. They made amazing films like The Lion King, Aladdin, Beauty & The Beast, The Little Mermaid to name a few... but unfortunately they don't seem to be as good as those any more. They pulled it back with The Princess & The Frog and Tangled which were awesome. We will just have to wait and see if they can keep it up now.I will give this film a 7 out of 10.A great film, but still not Disney's best.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,1,2,27 January 2013
Frozen," Another great Disney film...
","FROZENAnother Disney film that did not disappoint.The movie is about 2 princesses. One princess has powers where she can freeze anything at all. Everything is fine until one day she accidentally hurts her little sister whilst playing with her in the snow. Since then she is being forced to hide her power from everyone, so she locks herself in her room and hardly every comes out. One day when she becomes queen she accidentally freezes the entire town and runs away. Her little sister takes a trip to find her big sister so she can help her and get her to defrost the town.The film is a great little adventure. It is a lot of fun to watch and full of excitement. The new characters she encounters along the way were brilliant. I thought they were funny, especially the little snowman and the deer.Halfway through this film I was thinking that it is a typical Disney film with a very predictable ending, but the truth is it wasn't. The ending was not expected. It is a nice surprise not to guess the ending of a princess story.The other thing I liked about this is it didn't have a typical villain. The bad guy through most of the movie was the queen, but she was not bad she was just scared and wanted to be alone. It made a change to the typical story and I really liked that twist.The only thing I was disappointed with was the trailer. I loved the trailer so much. The snowman was trying to catch his carrot nose on the ice as the deer tried to catch the carrot too... both of which were slipping and sliding all over the place. I thought this was so funny and even though I have seen it a lot, I was looking forward to seeing it in the final movie, but it is not there at all. It was made as a trailer only which is a shame. But i still love it.If you are a fan of Disney and you love animation movies, then this is not to be missed.I will give this film 7 out of 10, but only because it is very good, but not as good as some of the older classics that I lover so much.'It's not nice to throw people'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,0,1,30 December 2013
Hellboy," A lot better the second time around.
","HELLBOYI had seen this when it first came out, but to be honest I didn't remember much about it, but I do remember thinking it was average at best.Now, after watching it again I can honestly say I enjoyed it a lot more the second time.The movie is a fantasy film about a demon who gets sucked through a gate through time and space to Earth by the Nazis. He is brought up by a professor who believes that he can help fight crime. All goes well until the people who brought him through want to reopen the gate and bring through these creatures to destroy the planet.The story is quite interesting and a lot of fun. There are some comedy moments in there, even a couple that made me laugh out loud. The action sequences were over the top, but for a fantasy film it is what is expected. The fighting was big and there was a lot of destruction. The make up and costumes was good... I liked the dark, but colourful look of the characters. You could tell this was made by Guillermo del Toro. It felt like one of his movies. He has a certain feel and look to his films, much like Tim Burton, but slightly darker. There were some scenes where the effects were not that great... but you can get past that.The film stars Ron Pearlman as Hellboy, and you can tell it's him from the outset. I have been watching Ron ever since I was a little boy. He was in a TV show I loved as a kid called Beauty and the Beast. He played the beast. He has a really interesting face. He plays characters like the Beast and Hellboy brilliantly. Also in this film was John Hurt, Selma Blair & Rupert Evans. Selma is a bit hit and miss. She can be good in some roles and bad in others. There are some episodes of Anger Management where she is so bad that it is embarrassing... but other where she is really good. This is one of those roles... she is good in a lot of scenes, but not so good in others. John and Rupert did brilliantly.A great fantasy action film with a lot going on. Visually a treat as well as keeping you entertained through the whole movie.I will give this 7 out of 10.'Red means stop!'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,0,0,25 July 2013
The Longest Day," I am not a big enough war film fan to appreciate this.
","THE LONGEST DAYThe longest movie more like!Now, to be honest I am not a huge war movie fan. There have been some great war movies... but in generally I find them all the same. Unfortunately, this one didn't really stand out for me. I was bored through some of it. It just felt like another old war movie. I know it did well when it first came out... it was nominated for 5 Oscars I believe.The acting was good by everyone... there is a very impressive cast list for this movie. I loved the actors in this film and am happy to have seen them all in one movie. The film stars far too many people to list, but the big names are... Richard Burton, Sean Connery, John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Roddy McDowall, Leslie Phillips, George Segal, Rod Steiger & Robert Wagner. Very impressive.The actual fighting scenes were pretty good, but being a war movie, that was pretty much it. There were a few parts of the movie that I thought were great... I loved the idea of them dropping little fake soldiers out of planes just to distract the Germans so they could attack from behind. There were also other parts that I really liked.The film is on for so long too... the movie goes on for 3 hours, and it definitely felt like it.I will give this film 4 out of 10.I do understand why this is a classic, but it is not for me i'm afraid. This film is made for war movie fans. For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",4,0,5,6 June 2013
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A really good drama... watch it if you can.
","THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTONThis movie is a movie that has always interested me, but I never got round to watching it until recently.The movie is about the life of Benjamin. When Benjamin was born his mother died during child birth. When his father saw the baby for the first time he was disgusted by the way he looked and left him on the steps of a house. The reason he looked so different was because Benjamin has a condition which makes him age backwards. He was born an old looking child and the older he got the younger he looked.I like the idea of this... when I first heard about it it did make me ask a lot of questions. The good thing is, they all got answered.The story was sad in places, but so happy in others. It is a drama that keeps you hooked to the TV. The movie is steady throughout. I can't remember one bit where I was bored or lost interest. The movie is quite long, it is on for 2 and a half hours, but it didn't feel that long.You really get to know the characters. Another thing I liked about this film was the fact that Benjamin was a likable guy most of the time, but from time to time he was horrible. He did things that was not too nice and even made me hate him at one point, but then he seemed very gullible at times.The acting was top class from everyone. Brad Pitt was fantastic playing Benjamin. He was even good at playing an old and young man. Cate Blanchett did a fantastic job too. I really felt sorry for her most throughout. Her character went though a lot and didn't deserve what she went though.Finally I have seen a movie where the make up is amazing. Brad Pitt actually looked old without the make up looking plastic. I have never seen make up this well done... in fact I am not sure it was make up or just computer effects that made him look old. It was just too good.This is a great film that I will watch again in the future. I am not surprised that it won numerous awards. They are all well deserved.I will give this film 7 out of 10.'It's a funny thing about comin' home. Looks the same, smells the same, feels the same. You'll realize what's changed is you.'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,0,1,30 December 2013
Million Dollar Baby," Absolutely brilliant... one of the best Eastwood films.
","MILLION DOLLAR BABYWow... this is a great film. I am not surprised that it won 4 Oscars, 2 Golden Globes, 2 Screen Actors Guild Awards and 10 other awards from various institutes.The story is about a guy who lives and works in a gym. All through the film you are hearing what he is seeing. He is seeing a tough trainer refusing to train a girl, all because she is a girl. The journey the three of them take together is a real roller coaster. I really can't explain more than that without posting spoilers.The story is so touching and emotional. I have been sitting here staring at this screen for about 10 minutes not knowing what to type. This film really has left me speechless.At first I thought it was going to be Rocky with a female. But it was nothing like it. Yes there was boxing and training, but in a completely different way.Now, it seems a boxing film can't be made realistically. Every boxing film I have seen just can't quite make the boxing look real... unfortunately it is the same with this one. I watch a lot of boxing and it is all about skill and technique. But in these movies it seems it is all about getting your butt kicked until you all of a sudden win with one punch. There were bits in this film where one boxer in particular did some underhanded moves... if that happened in real boxing the boxer in question would have been disqualified straight away... but not in this film. It is a shame, but I also understand that the film makers are trying to make the film more interesting. I do still love boxing movies... the Rocky movies are classic (except for part V... terrible!), and they are not very realistic either.The acting was absolutely brilliant. The casting was perfect. Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank & Morgan Freeman star in this. And if Clint wasn't busy enough, Directed by Clint Eastwood, Produced by Clint Eastwood & Original Music by Clint Eastwood. The man is a legend.There is so much I want to talk about here... but I can't really because it will give to much away.I will give this film 8 out of 10.A very strong story and a very strong performance.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",8,1,3,15 July 2013
Brave," Not a classic Disney film, but still very good.
","BRAVESo for Christmas, my parents got me a few of the Disney films missing from my collection. Today I watched Brave. I had never seen this one before which is not like me... I normally see them in the cinema, but for some reason this one passed me by.The movie is about a Scottish princess who is being forced to get married, but she really doesn't want to. So one day when going through a forest she stumbles across a witches house, she decides to purchase a spell from her to change her mother. The problem is, she wanted to change her mothers opinions on the forced marriage... instead she changed her mother into a bear. Now she has to find a way of changing her mother back into a human before her father finds the bear. Her father kills them.It is a great story, but I am sure Disney have done this before... or at least very similar. Brother Bear is similar to this. There are obvious differences, but they are both about them trying to find ways of changing someone important back from a bear.The animation is brilliant as always, but I find it very hard to fault Disney of their animation. I honestly believe they are the best in the world.As always there are some musical numbers in the movie. They were quite good, but not very memorable. They just didn't seem to have the typical Disney hook. They were not very catchy. But they still fit in with the movie quite well.There were some very funny moments in the movie which made me and my family laugh.The voice work was also very good like normal, the only problem I would say with it though is, there were a lot of famous people used for the voice work in this movie, but I only recognised one voice. They really could have just got anyone to do the voices. The main recognisable voice was done by Billy Connolly. He has such a distinctive voice that I could tell, it was him straight away. Other voice artists were Kelly Macdonald, Emma Thompson, Julie Walters & Robbie Coltrane. I didn't know these guys did the voices until the end credits of the movie.If you are a fan of Disney, then I recommend this to you. It is very entertaining for you and the kids. Yet again Disney did not disappoint.I will give this film 7 out of 10.'If you had a chance to change your fate, would you?'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204",7,2,4,27 December 2013
Evil Dead," I liked it, but did expect more.
","EVIL DEADI was looking forward to this film so much... I hate the way everything is being remade at the moment... but seeing as Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell were both involved in this, I thought it was going to amazing! It was very good... but I was still disappointed.The movie is about a group of people that go into a cabin in the woods to help their friend get off of drugs... she is going cold turkey. They discover in the cellar a load of dead animals and a book that is wrapped up in barb wire. One of them opens the book and starts to read it, which then lets in the demons that take over their bodies and goes on a massive killing spree.I really liked the idea of them going there to help their friend... it makes a change. In most horror films, they always end up in the cabin in the woods just for a holiday or a trip out etc... finally a different excuse to be shacked up in the middle of nowhere.There was so much gore in this film... and I loved it. The ways that the murders happened were really well done and some where very inventive... but unfortunately, most of the ways they happen have been seen before. It seems the guys making it wanted to scare the audience with shock value other than being actually scary. You saw everything (almost). There was no mystery or moment that had me on the edge of my seat wondering if they will get out alive. It was pure violence.The other way this film might have scared some people was the jump scares... there seemed to be a lot of them. So many times in the film, there were things jumping out or loud noises right in the middle of a quiet period of the movie... they were put there to make everyone jump. It's a shame, because this is a cheap way of scaring someone and I am not a huge fan of it in horror films. I like it to happen once in a movie... but when it happens so many times it loses the effect. This film did not make me jump once. I was expecting most of them to come.The acting was actually quite good... I have never heard of any of the actors in this film, which is a very good thing for a horror. I always find it to be more believable when you don't have a familiar face on the screen. That way you have no idea if they will survive or not. We all know that if there was a horror film starring Brad Pitt or Johnny Depp, the likely hood of either of them dying is very slim. Although it is possible as we found out from Scream... poor Drew Barrymore.The whole cast was great... not one bad actor among them. I hope their careers take off now from this.The make up and special effects were very good. I can't fault it at all... everyone looked really freaky and scary. I really liked they way they looked when they were possessed.All in all this film was really good... But I guess I was just expecting it to be a bit more mystery and was hoping I would have to use my imagination more. Sometimes that can be more scary than seeing everything.I will give this film 7 out of 10. But I was expecting to give it a higher mark before I went to see it.Maybe it would have been slightly better if Sam Raimi directed it.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,4,16,1 May 2013
Clash of the Titans," Finally a good remake.
","CLASH OF THE TITANSThe original is a complete classic... so when I heard they were remaking it I had my doubts. I went to the cinema to see it because the trailer actually looked quite good... and I loved it. I finally got it on DVD and decided to watch it again today... did I like it as much the second time around?The movie is about mortal people turning on the immortal god Zeus, so when Zeus sends his brother down to the planet to teach the humans a lesson in respect and get them to prey to Zeus again. Zeus' brother, Hades, goes and releases the Kraken. A huge monster that only knows how to destroy everything in its path. The only man who can stop all this destruction is Perseus... the son of Zeus.This remake is a complete success in my mind. It has everything I wanted from the original. The thing I love about the original version was the really bad effects... for their time they are amazing. But I would not want to change them. The effects in this version are up to date, but there are moments where you can clearly see it is computer generated.I loved the giant scorpions and I loved the Kraken, but my favourite characters from this story is Medusa. They all looked amazing, but Medusa was awesome! I loved the snake hair and the face when she stares at people is really spooky.The movie stars Sam Worthington, Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Jason Flemyng, Gemma Arterton & Mads Mikkelsen. Everyone dies a great job. Especially Liam Neeson. I am not really a Liam Neeson fan, but since he has started making action film I am starting to like him a lot more.The film is full of action from beginning to end. And the action is full on. I really like the fantasy world that this film is set in.Finally, I was super impressed to the little nod to the original version when Perseus pulls out the original mechanical owl and asks what it is. Perfect!Is is exciting and a lot of fun to watch... and even though it is missing the feel of the original film, it really is a remake that I like.I will give this film 7 out of 10.'There is a God in you. Be sure to bring it. End of lesson.'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,0,1,13 February 2014
The Hangover Part II," A lot better that I was expecting.
","THE HANGOVER PART III was not a fan of the first one... I didn't really like it and it didn't think it was very funny. This one was better.The film was yet another adventurous trip for the 3 best friends... the problem is, nobody remembers what they did yesterday... again!The same cast came back in this and they were OK. The movie starred Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, Justin Bartha & Ken Jeong. I like Bradley Cooper... he is a good actor and he does a good job in this. Ed Helms was OK... he was supposed to be worried about his future brother in law through this film, but he didn't look too bothered at some points. Not a very realistic reaction. Zach Galifianakis is annoying. He has not made any good movies that I have seen... and he is irritating in most films I have seen. Frenemy being the worst. The star of the film is definitely Ken Jeong... I love this guy in Community and he brings that same characteristic to these movies.There are some really funny scenes in this film. The most shocking and funniest scene is where Ed finds out that he cheated on his fiancé with a ladyboy! Oh my god... I laughed so much.Iron Mike Tyson makes another appearance in this movie... blimey! That man might be one of the greatest boxers of all time, but he can't sing at all. It was awful.Watching this film has made me want to watch the first one again. I don't remember much of it... but I do remember I didn't like it much. Maybe I wasn't really in the mood for it. I will give it another go now because of this.I will give this film 6 out of 10.A good movie with some good laugh out loud moments... but also has some bad moments too.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",6,0,1,19 May 2013
Friends with Benefits," I quite liked it.
","FRIENDS WITH BENEFITSI had seen this before and back then I thought this was quite good... and it still it only quite good.This is a typical romantic comedy. It is funny up until about two thirds in and then it goes all romantic and turns into a full on chick flick.I really enjoyed this movie. I thought the story was good and everything was going so well until the end. Of course the story always ends up living happily ever after etc... but just for once, I would like to see a romantic comedy where they don't end up together. I think the only film I have seen where it is not the same old happy ending was The Break-Up.This film stars Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis. I like both of these people. I think they both are very talented actors. Although, this is not their best film.The story is about a couple of people who become good friends... and when they both decide that relationships are not for them, they decide to just stay friends, but have sex. No feelings, no commitments, no awkward situations... just sex.This does make for a very funny movie. There are some great scenes in this movie that made me laugh... and as much as it pains me to say it, Justin Timberlake can be funny at times. He is a good actor... shame about his music.I will give this film 7 out of 10.Good acting, good story, funny... but predictable ending.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,0,2,1 April 2013
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," I liked it...
","This film is a complete mind bender! I had not seen anything about it really apart from the poster. I Didn't see the trailer or read the synopsis before watching the movie. I just decided to see it because it had Jim Carrey & Kate Winslet in it.I had been told it was not a comedy so knew not to expect Jim Carrey's over the top comedy acting that we all expect from his work. But when I started watching this I felt sorry for him... he plays a depressed man really well. He had problems and seemed so lonely. So at this point I thought I was watching a movie about a guy with personal problems meeting a woman and their lives together trying to cope with his depression... I was wrong!Imagine my surprise when all of a sudden memories are being erased from their minds thanks to a company that can help you lose all the bad painful memories in your life.I won't give too much away just in case you want to see it, but trust me when I say that this movie is all over the place. One minute you are with Jim and he is sad because his relationship is not going well and loses his partner (Winslet) and he goes to get his memory erased to get rid of the pain, the next minute you are seeing him happy with Kate during happier times, but during these times things around them are fading and blanking out.There is another side of the story which involves the staff at the company that erases the memories. This fits well in the movie and ties nicely up at the end of the film.Jim Carrey plays the part really well and I now see him as a good actor as well as someone as you can just laugh at when he is over the top . He has proved he can calm things down and play a serious role. I feel Kate Winslet did a good job too, but didn't shine as much as Jim did on screen.The supporting cast also has some famous names in there too including Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood who play employees of the company.Final mark I personally give this movie is: 6 out of 10.But whatever you do, do not watch this film unless you can sit down and watch it from beginning to end. If you are not concentrating on it or catch it from the middle of the movie, you will struggle to understand it.For more reviews check out my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204",6,1,3,7 November 2012
Taken," I thought it was brilliant.
","TAKENI thought this was brilliant.I always avoided watching this. I always felt the Liam Neeson was not a great actor, but this is his best role by far that I have seen. He has made some other good films, but I never expected he could pull off an action role.This film is about an ex CIA agent who has retired to be near his daughter. She then goes to Paris to follow U2 and get's kidnapped. The kidnappers intend to drug her, pimp her and then sell her. Liam goes in for the rescue.This film gave me so many emotions. I really got into it. Whether that be because I have 2 daughters myself or not I don't know. Firstly, I felt so sorry for him at the beginning of the film. All he wants is to spend some time with his daughter, but he doesn't seem to get the chance. At her birthday he got left behind because her new stepdad, who is rich, just outdid him with presents and party etc... Then there was Liams ex wife played by Famke Janssen. Oh my god... she made me so angry. She was such a bitch at the beginning of the movie.Then when he went to Paris to save his daughter, I was really on edge... I didn't know if he was going to be too late. There were s many girls that they had kidnapped and sold etc that he was having a hard time. With films like these you never know if the daughter could have lived or died... she could easily have died and he would go for revenge, or she could have easily lived and he would just rescue her. It was a good, on the edge of your seat thriller.The acting was really good by everyone. The story was a typical search and rescue story, but it is a very good story to tell.There were a few bits in the movie which made me question things. I know he is an ex CIA agent, but where did he get all the equipment he used. There was one scene where he saves a random girl from the drug dealer/pimp guys, because she could have information about his daughter... he helped her by having a drip set up in his hotel room, needles and everything else to make her better. He made the room look like a hospital. haha. Where did he get all that stuff from?I will give this film 8 out of 10.I really enjoyed it... and it changed my mind about what Liam Neeson can do.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",8,0,2,8 April 2013
Victory," I liked it.
","ESCAPE TO VICTORYThis film was recommended to me by my parents. My Dad is a fan of this movie... and I can see why. It is a good film.I am not a football fan at all, but I did really enjoy this film.It is about a group of people being held captive by the Germans during World War II. They start to play football whilst being held, and the German soldiers challenge them to a game. The game becomes a big thing and ends up being played in Paris. The whole time they are arranging this game, the inmates are arranging to escape during the half time break.The film stars a young Sylvester Stallone and Michael Caine. I am a fan of both of there guys. They are both legendary actors. This is neither of their best film... they have both made better movies. But this is still very good. The legendary footballer, Pele, also stars. Pele makes a great shot in the final match. :)The story is a typical war escape movie. It's not as good as the classic Great Escape, but still is similar in ways.The acting is not bad. There are some bits that were not brilliant, but you hardly noticed it really.There were a few bits that I thought were just a little too unrealistic. For instance, a German soldier sees one of the prisoners escaping, and he just smiled and sat down. Hmmmm... not overly likely.I will give this film 7 out of 10.Very entertaining, but not really realistic. :)For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,2,3,7 April 2013
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Not bad... but I have a lot of things I didn't like.
","TWILIGHT: BREAKING DAWN PART IIOK, now I have some issues with these movies. I have seen them all now with my girlfriend, who is a massive fan. She has read all the books and seen all the movies and loves every bit of it. I on the other hand, am not impressed too much.I did enjoy them, they are very entertaining movies and I can see why they are popular. But I won't be reading the books.In case you don't know, Twilight is a love story between a mortal girl, a vampire and a guy who changes into a werewolf.I love vampire movies out of all the mythical creatures, vampires are my favourite by far. But this story killed 2 of the most important things about vampires. 1. Vampires have fangs to help them drink the blood of their victims... not in this movie! They have normal teeth. 2. Vampires can't go in the sunlight because they burn Nope, not here... they glisten and shine in the sunlight. I was not happy about that at all... when I saw the first movie I was really disappointed with those facts because it goes against what vampires are.Anywho, back to the final chapter in the series... This one was OK in places. The story is good, the action was good, even the acting was alright. There are some really good actors in this film. I don't rate Robert Pattinson much. He is OK, but I don't think he is as good as everyone else seems to think he is. Kristen Stewart did well in this one... I prefer her character the way she is in this movie compared to her previous ones. Then you have Dakota Fanning who has always been an amazing actress, and then Michael Sheen... this guy is awesome and has made some brilliant films in the past.But, the effects in the film were terrible, Bellas baby was clearly a computer generated baby, you could see how unrealistic it was. Also, when the vampires were running in the forest and jumping around, you could see they were on wires... you could not see the wires, but it all looked a bit too much like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.But, finally the ending was painful! I felt like I had been robbed. I hated the ending to this movie. I watched it in the cinema and when the ending happened there were a lot of groans in the cinema. I don't think there were many people happy with what happened but my girlfriend loved it. Maybe it's a girl thing. JAnyway, I will give Breaking Dawn Part 2 a 6 out of 10.The whole series was entertaining, but it definitely had its weak moments and the less said about the end the better!For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",6,2,5,6 December 2012
Mama," I liked it a lot.
","MAMAThis was a good movie. I really enjoyed this one.This is a horror movie about a guy who kills his wife and takes his 2 kids away... but when his car crashes, he gets lost in the woods until he finds a cabin. He takes his children inside, but there is spirit in there protecting the children. The spirit then follows the children into the city when they go and live with their uncle.It is not very scary... there were a couple of attempts of jump scares, but not too many... and none of them made me jump anyway.The story was very good and there were quite a few emotions throughout the film. At some points of the film I felt so sorry for the children, but then something would happen and the next minute I would think the kids are evil. All the way through you don't really know whether the kids are good or not.There was one scene in the film that was really horrible. There was a woman who had a dream and this dream was horrible. There is a baby in the dream and I felt so bad for this baby. It looked so scared.The effects were not brilliant at times, but that didn't ruin the movie. The story and the acting carried it through well.The actors were all really good... especially the children. Normally I find child actors very annoying and too young to have much talent. But not in this case. Both kids did a great job. The stars are Jessica Chastain, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Megan Charpentier & Isabelle Nelisse.I will give this film 8 out of 10.I really liked it. Great story, mixed emotions about the characters and great acting. A horror film that is definitely worth watching.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",8,1,2,2 July 2013
Super 8," A good movie, but was expecting more.
","SUPER 8I remember watching this when the movie was first released. I thought it was very average at the time... but now I have watched it again I thought it was better the second time around.The movie is about a group of kids that are trying to make a movie. One night they are filming on a train station when they witness a huge train crash... what they don't realise is that the train was carrying some alien creature that has now escaped.The story is quite good. What I like about it is it has a lot of different levels to it. There is not just the one story about the alien... there are other elements to this film. The relationships that the characters have towards one another are really good and add a lot to the film. The relationship of the children with their parents is a big part of it. These kids are going through other things in their lives other than the disaster going on around them.The film was shot to make it look like an older film than it is. It tried to feel like an 80s film... but failed mostly. There are moments that felt like it could have been made in the 80s. We have the hair, the cars, the soundtrack... but for some reason it is still missing something. I just can't put my finger on what it is. Maybe the effects are too good. I think if the effects were more 80s then it might have had the right atmosphere.The acting was good throughout from everyone. The movie stars Joel Courtney, Ryan Lee, Zach Mills, Riley Griffiths, Gabriel Basso, Ella Fanning, Kyle Chandler and Ron Eldard. All deserve a lot of credit, but the best performance by far came from Ella Fanning. She has a lot of talent just like her older sister. I always thought that children were terrible actors and mostly annoying, but the Fanning sisters were both amazing when they were little. I just hope that they continue on and become big stars. They deserve it.I was a little disappointed that we didn't see the alien sooner. I understand the suspense side of things and I agree with it in a lot of ways, but I did think that the alien could have been seen a bit more in the film. It also took the creature too long to even make it's first appearance in the film.The movie was directed by J. J. Abrams. So as you can imagine, there was a bit of lens flare... no wait, a lot of lens flare. It was crazy! At some points I thought it was ridiculous. On the bright side though... Steven Spielberg was involved in this film also. These guys work well together.I did like this film, but unfortunately I am not sure there was too much memorable in it. I can't guarantee that I will remember this film 1 year down the line. Only time will tell.I will give this film 6 out of 10.'Excuse me, can I have another order of fries?

Sinister," It was alright...
","SINISTER.It was alright.I was really enjoying this movie until something happened and then I thought it was just ridiculous.There are some really good scenes in this film. Also, the ending is really good.I just thought that some of the bits in the film felt like a live action Scooby-Doo story.The casting was good, the characters were all believable. Apart from one... the deputy that helps the main character was really bad. I mean, why does there need to be a stupid police man in a horror film?Sinister wasn't very scary though. I have never been scared of a movie which I am really upset about. I would love to feel scared from a film, after all that is what a horror film is for... but for some reason i have never felt scared watching them. But even so... Sinister is not a scary film. There are a few jump scares in it which might make you jump. There was one scene that might scare you a little bit if you are easily scared by films. In fact it was my favourite scene in the whole film.I will give this film a 7 out of 10.Pretty good, but could have been better.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,0,0,31 December 2012
Up," Another great film, but with a few big surprises that you don't see in any other Disney movie.
","UPWell... this movie is a surprise.A guy promises his wife that they will go to Paradise Falls to live one day... but as their lives together go on, they let the dream slip away. But when his wife dies he ties a load of balloons to his house and floats it to Paradise Falls.It is a great adventure just like every other Disney film... which is a good thing. After all that is what I love about Disney.There are some big differences in this movie though. Firstly the beginning of the movie is very sad. As I have stated above, the main characters wife dies. Now I know this is rare in a Disney film, but not unheard of. I know Bambi's mum got shot and Simbas dad was murdered... but this was different. She not only died of old age, but during their life you are made aware that she had a miscarriage. It is a very risky move from Disney to add this to the film. It really was not needed, but it did add to the back story. It was a very sad start to the film which I never felt with a Disney movie before.Secondly... there was blood! There is a scene in the film where the old man is having an argument with a builder... and he gets very frustrated and hits the builder on the head with his walking frame. The next thing you see is the builder on the floor with blood coming from his head. Now I might be wrong, but I do not remember ever seeing blood in a Disney film. It actually shocked me a little bit as it just seemed out of place. Normally when a character get's a hit of the head there is a bump or red mark, but never blood. This was another bold move, but just felt unnecessary.The story was very good. I loved the idea of the old man after many years doing what he promised his wife. I think everyone should finish what they started before they pass on. It was a film about completion. The old man was not very likable in places. He was a mean old man who was horrible to almost everyone. The little boy that went with him on his adventure was brilliant. I thought he was very funny and I felt so sorry for him in places. One of my favourite characters was the talking dog. He was great. I laughed so much when he was chasing the ball and squirrels. What a great character.After this film was made, someone actually tried lifting a little shed with a load of balloons to see if it was possible... it was. They actually got the shed off of the ground. There was a documentary made about it.A very moving story and possibly one of the saddest Disney films made. It is definitely worth watching and enjoying more than once.I will give this film 7 out of 10.'Won't you please be my prisoner, please, please, please!'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,0,1,30 December 2013
Rio," A good entertaining movie.
","RIOThis is a film that I saw the trailer of when it first came out and thought it looked average. Now after watching it I can say in my opinion it is better than I thought it would be.The movie is about a blue Macaw named Blu. He is a domesticated bird that lives with his owner in a book shop. When a man walks into her shop and asks to take the bird to Rio so he can mate with a female Macaw, they reluctantly agree. Whilst in Rio, the 2 birds get stolen and now it is a hunt for the 2 missing birds and an adventure for them as they find their way back to their owner.The story was really good and the animation was very good too. I liked the characters. I thought they were very funny and the relationship they all had together was really well done.The action was good and was steady throughout the movie. There was not really a lot of time in the film where not a lot happened. It was entertaining throughout.The voice work was really good. They were so funny in places. Jesse Eisenberg was the voice of Blu. Very well done and very funny. Anne Hathaway was Lewel, the female Macaw. She was also very good, but nothing special. I didn't even realise it was her until the end. They could have got anyone do this voice. Other voice artists were Wanda Sykes, Jane Lynch, Jamie Foxx & Will.I.Am. Again though, I had no idea that these guys did the voices.I thought this was very good and had its own feel to it. You could tell this was not a Disney film, but that does not take anything away from it. It is a great film.I will give this film 7 out of 10.'Not cool man, not cool!'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,0,0,27 March 2014
Total Recall," I love this film, but Arnie has done better.
","TOTAL RECALLWhat a classic movie. I have seen this film so many times... and it is still as good today as it was back in the 90s.This is Arnie during his peak. He is a legend thanks to the movies he made in the late 80s and early 90s.I know this film didn't really stick to the story in the book it is based on, but I think this film made it it's own.The effects were not too bad for it's time. Obviously these days the effects could be better. But in a way the dodgy plastic Arnie heads makes this film better.As always, Arnie has some great lines that me and a few friends of mine like to quote on a regular basis... 'Come on, you got what you want... give these people air'... it obviously sounds better with his accent.I love the mutants in this film... there are so many good actors in here. I would say the casting was perfect.This is not Arnies best film... in fact he has done a few that are better... but this is up there. I am a huge Arnie fan and I loved this film this time around as much as I did the first time I watched it.I will give this film 8 out of 10.A classic Schwarzenegger movie and one that will be treasured for many years to come... especially as it is a lot better than the remake.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",8,0,1,17 March 2013
In Time," Great film
","IN TIME.I loved this film. I have never seen a film like it... the story was awesome.In this film, there is no money... you buy everything with time. Everyone has a clock in their arm which they can see. The time just keeps ticking down and if the counter gets to zero, you are dead. You work for time... to get paid you have to put your arm in a machine that adds time to your clock... to buy things you have to use the time you have to buy it.The story really did appeal to me... i thought it was a great idea.It has got Justin Timberlake in it... Now, I don't like Justin much, but the more films I see him in the more I like him as an actor.He does a great job. The main actress in it is Amanda Seyfried. She does a good job too... the film also stars Cillian Murphy.There were 2 things in this movie I was not really impressed with. Firstly, there was a scene where a car crashes and falls down a hill before crashing to a halt at the bottom... the effects were terrible. You could clearly see the car was computer simulated. It didn't fall like a car would. Secondly, in the film people could fight for time... I liked the idea of this, but Justin had a way of winning these fights... but his way of winning was weak... i just didn't get how he could win the way he does. Watch it... you will know what I mean.All in all this film is great. I really enjoyed it.I will give it 8 out of 10.Justins best film so far.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",8,15,19,24 February 2013
Thor," I liked it more than others.
","THORI know out of all the superhero films that have been released, this one got one of the worst reviews, but to be honest I liked it. It was not the worst one by far... Captain America was terrible.This movie is about a God who is banished from Asgard to Earth to live among the humans... but when he is here he becomes one of the heroes that protects us.The action in this film is great. I always thought Thor was quite boring before watching this. But this film soon changed my opinion on him. The fighting scenes were great and full of excitement.This film is also visually beautiful. The scenes up in Asgard look amazing, especially at the bridge. The effects were brilliant too. The machines and creatures looked brilliant.The acting was questionably from a couple of people, but the main cast did a good job. The movie stars Chris Hemsworth, Anthony Hopkins, Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston, Stellan Skarsgard and Kat Dennings. Another actor that was a supporting cast member but deserves a mention is Idris Elba. That man has been in so much recently and he is great in everything I have seen him in... except that Sky advert. haha. Tom was the star of the movie though. He played his part so well that you didn't realise he was turning into the bad guy of the movie until it was too late.There are some comedy moments in this film too, but they are places and done so well that it didn't take anything away from the action or the story. It was funny and perfect for the film.All in all this film was not as bad as everyone else thought it was. I enjoyed it and would watch it again.I will give this film 7 out of 10.'I never wanted the throne, I only ever wanted to be your equal!'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,0,2,6 May 2014
The Untouchables," A good gritty drama.
","THE UNTOUCHABLESI always avoided this film because it starred Kevin Costner. I am not a huge fan of his, but he has made some good movies.This movie is about a federal agent who is hell bent on arresting and convicting the infamous Al Capone. Federal agent Eliot Ness gets help from a beat cop, a rookie and an accountant.This drama is actually really good. I was expecting this to be a very slow film, but it wasn't. There were a lot of good action scenes and the gun fights were really good. In places this film was gritty and really sucked me in. It was interesting to see how the federal agent planned on convicting Al Capone, especially as Capone was a very dangerous man and was also bribing everyone. Eliot had a big problem trying to get anything to stick on him.The effects were not too good. There was one scene where a guy was falling from a roof top, but this was awful. You could clearly see it was a fake background as he was falling. It reminded me of a comedy film. The only other thing I can complain about the effects. When a guy got shot in the face, you saw the blood on the wall behind him, but he clearly didn't have an entry wound in his head. They didn't even try and make it look real.The acting was pretty good throughout. The film stars Kevin Costner in probably his best role I have seen him in. Other cast members were Sean Connery, Andy Garcia and Robert DeNiro. I thought this casting was perfect. I was not sure Sean Connery would be any good in this role either, but I have no complaints. He did a great job. The best performance for me though would be for Andy Garcia. I thought he did a brilliant job as the rookie.This is a very good drama and very entertaining.I will give this 7 out of 10.'You just fulfilled the first rule of law enforcement: make sure when your shift is over you go home alive.

The Godfather: Part III," Such a disappointing ending to the trilogy!
","THE GODFATHER PART IIIOh dear... i really didn't like this one. I was so disappointed. The first 2 were good, but this really let the trilogy down.I was actually bored through parts of the movie.I can see why people think this is the worst one of the trilogy... personally i think it should be wiped out of the trilogy and we should all pretend it doesn't exist.There are a few bits in the movie which are good. I didn't hate it all, in fact to be honest I didn't hate it... I just was hoping for so much more that i felt let down. As a movie, it is average... but it is nowhere in the same league as the other 2 movies.The story lacked something... and the characters were not as good in this one as the others. Even Al Pacino wasn't as good in this one as the other 2. I know his character was trying to go straight and leave the Mafia life behind, but still... it was like a whole new character. It didn't feel like the same Michael from the first 2 movies.And just to top things off, it was on for 2 hours 45 minutes! :(I will give this film 5 out of 10.Very very disappointed. I was hoping for a much better end to the trilogy.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",5,1,3,25 January 2013
Zombieland," Excellent comedy...
","ZOMBIELANDOK... It's time to nut up or shut up.I have seen this movie before and loved it. And can say I loved it just as much the second time around.The story is straight forward enough... it is about a student trying to make his way to his parents house whilst the rest of the population are zombies. Along the way he meets a guy who is very much unhinged and on the edge... they also run into a couple of girls who are trying to make their way to an amusement park as they have been told there are no zombies there.This is not a horror as such... it is more comedy. I was laughing all the way through this film. The language and situations they all get put in was hilarious. Also the facial expressions on the cast are brilliant.There are also a few animated sections in it too which makes this film even better. When one the the guys is telling us about the rules he sticks to to survive, you see them appear in the background on the screen. The same kind of text is during the credits at the beginning. It is really well done because the letters and words get smashed and knocked out of the way by zombies.The casting was brilliant. The actors were Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone & Abigail Breslin. Every one of them had funny moments in the movie and they all had good chemistry. They all worked very well together. For me though, the funniest and main character was Woody. I think he is such a great actor. He can play serious roles and comedy roles excellently.There was also the best cameo ever in a movie... The characters make their way into a mansion and then you realise it is Bill Murray's house... Bill Murray... BILL F*****G MURRAY! haha. Also, Bill has the best line in the whole film. That man is a genius and he makes me laugh so much.The make up was good... the zombies looked gross and the guts looked nice and juicy... I am glad they didn't cut back on the gore too much, but also it was not too bloody.I will give this film 8 out of 10.And remember... rule number 32... enjoy the little things.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",8,0,2,13 July 2013
It's a Wonderful Life," A nice family film. I understand why it is a classic.
","IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFEAnother classic film I dad never seen before. I liked it.The most I had seen of this movie before was in Gremlins, when Billy's mother was watching it in the kitchen.The movie is about a man who is completely selfless. He thinks about everyone else and other thing before himself... he gives up so much for other people. But when things start to go wrong for him, he feels desperate and tries to kill himself... until he is saved by an angel. The angel then teaches him what things would have been like if he had never been born.It is a lovely film. It has romance, comedy and drama in it. It really is a nice film to watch at Christmas time.The movie stars James Stewart, Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore & Thomas Mitchell. The acting was over the top a little bit, but back in the day when this was made, all acting was over the top in one way or another.I will give this film 7 out of 10.It is a nice family film that will have all the old women crying.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,0,4,16 June 2013
Die Hard," A classic action film...
","DIE HARDHell yeah!This film is about a cop from New York, named John, that is spending Christmas with his estranged wife and kids. While he is waiting for his wife in her office at her work place, a group of terrorists come in and holds everyone hostage. The hostages make a few demands, but while the police and FBI are outside trying to negotiate their way in, the terrorists are trying to break into a vault that holds a lot of money. John is on his own in there, picking them all off one by one while he tries to save his wife and the rest of the hostages.This is a blast from the past for me. I watched this a lot when I was a kid. The action is awesome this really is one of Bruce Willis' best movies.The film is full of funny catchphrases that is quoted every day. I love the language they use in this film. Hans Gruber is the bad guy, he is from Germany and his accent is brilliant. I love the attitude that John has all the way through this film. He makes me laugh at times, but also angry. It is a good combination. His sarcasm at times really makes the film better.The relationship he has with Sgt. Powell is brilliant. I love the fact that the contact he has with the outside world was with one cop. They form a nice bond and a friendship even though they have never met. It is a nice moment when they do finally meet at the end of the movie.The action scenes were epic back then too. The film was made in 1988, and the explosions and gun fights were great. The other thing I liked about this film was the fact there were explosions, gun fights and even fist fights. During the fist fights, the good guy got his butt kicked too it was good at the time because he was losing so badly that you really didn't know if he could beat them all.The effects were questionable in places. Some of the explosions didn't look too real, but then others looked brilliant.The casting was fantastic. Bruce Willis in his most famous role. He will always be remembered for being John McClane. He was great. Bonnie Bedelia as his wife Holly was also really well chosen. She had great 80s hair back then, but it suited her and the time. She is a great actress, especially in this movie. Reginald VelJohnson played his friend Sgt Powell. I recognize Reginald from a few films. He always has a very friendly smile and seems like a guy you would like straight away. He is a good actor. Alan Rickman played the leader of the terrorists, Hans Gruber. This was the perfect role for Alan. He is really good at playing slimy, scary characters. Other cast members were William Atherton (another actor who is great at playing slimeballs), Robert Davi and Grand L. Bush.This is such a classic movie and should be seen by everyone. There have been 4 sequels to this movie so far and there are some great films amongst them, but they will never top the original although I do love part 3 as much as this one.I will give this film 8 out of 10.'Welcome to the party pal!'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204",8,1,2,9 January 2014
When Harry Met Sally...," It was average at best
","WHEN HARRY MET SALLYI was disappointed.This is supposed to be one of those classic films I guess I didn't get it.This was just a regular, average romantic comedy. I didn't hate it it just wasn't anything special.Everyone knows the famous scene in this movie when Meg Ryan fakes an orgasm in a café.Yeah it was funny, but not laugh out loud funny.The film stars Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan who are 2 people who car share their journey after leaving college.They do not get along very well on the way.5 years later, they bump into each other and they still don't like each other.Another 5 years passes and they bump into each other again and they both have something in common they have both recently been dumped.So they cry on each others shoulders and become friends and the rest is what you can expect from any romantic comedy.The one thing that was different about this film was the dialogue. A lot of the movie was just Harry & Sally talking. Not a lot else happened through the movie, it was just their opinions on certain things and them talking to each other but I liked this. The dialogue was very good in this film. It was not boring and you actually wanted to hear their conversation. It was very well written.The acting was really good too. Billy and Meg both did a great job and Carrie Fisher was in it and she did a good job too.One of the things I did like about this movie was the feel of it. I love 80s movies and you can really tell this is an 80s film.They have a completely different feel to them than the more recent movies and I love them.In my mind, the 80s films are the best.I will give this film 6 out of 10.It was OK but I guess I had to watch it at the time to understand why it is so classic.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",6,3,6,15 April 2013
The Wolf of Wall Street," A good movie, but on for far too long.
","THE WOLF OF WALL STREETI know this film got a lot of press and award nods, but I don't fully understand why. Yes, this is a good film, but is it a great film that will become a classic? No.The movie follows the life of a stock broker who starts out with nothing and ends up with millions of dollars and a very successful life... But he is not doing it all the legal way. This is a true story based on the life of Jordan Belfort.For a start this film felt like it went on forever. It was 3 hours long and it felt like it. Even though the film was entertaining, it didn't feel like the time flew by... It felt like 3 hours and towards the end I started getting slightly fidgety. I was not very comfortable and I was ready for the movie to end.Jordan has led one hell of a life. He was the boss every bachelor would love to have. Drugs, hookers and hardly any rules applied in his offices. Some of the things they did was shocking. I am surprised this guy didn't die from the amount of stuff he was doing. He did seem to have a lot of fun though... But he didn't seem to care who got hurt along the way.There were some very funny scenes and characters in this movie. I did laugh out loud a few times.I don't pretend to understand the stock market, but you don't need to understand it to enjoy this movie. I enjoyed it even though I still don't understand what he did for a living. It doesn't try and teach you anything, it just concentrates on his life which is a good thing.Jordan is not a very nice man, but I can understand why people wanted to be around him. He looked after his friends well, but he also dragged them down with him. Sometimes he did a nice thing and his heart was in the rig place, but other times he was as mean as they come.Overall the movie was good, but it dragged on too long. I don't know if I will remember too much about it in a year.I will give this film 6 out of 10.'My name is Jordan Belfort. I'm a former member of the middle class raised by two accountants in a tiny apartment in Bayside, Queens. The year I turned 26, as the head of my own brokerage firm, I made $49 million, which really p*****d me off because it was three shy of a million a week.'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page.Ordinary Person Movie Reviews.",6,0,1,2 August 2014
Ice Age: Continental Drift," Very funny and entertaining.
","ICE AGE 4: CONTINENTAL DRIFTI was fully expecting this to get old now. I thought part 3 started to slip into the monotonous but this pulled it back. I thought it was very funny and really good.The story is about Manny and his friends. They get separated from Ellie and have to find their way back to his family as the planet goes through a complete meltdown.The original voice cast members return as their characters Ray Romano as Manny, John Leguizamo as Sid & Denis Leary as Diego.There were a few new characters too. I loved the pirates that kidnapped them all. They were really funny and they fit into the film really well. You also get to meet Sid's granny. She was hilarious. She has not teeth and watching her to try and eat some fruit is so funny.Other voices were provided by Seann William Scott, Josh Peck, Peter Dinklage, Wanda Sykes, Jennifer Lopez, Queen Latifah, Nick Frost, Alan Tudyk & Nicki Minaj.As always though, the funniest character was Scrat. He is such a great character. I am surprised there is not a spin off movie yet just set on him. He is and always has been the star of the movies. Besides without Scrat, there would be no movie he causes all the mess in the first place. The film is full of action and adventure, which is what you want when watching a family film. The kids will love this. I watched it with a load of adults but I will put it on again for my daughter as she loved the other 3.I will give this film 7 out of 10.Very entertaining and made the Ice Age films more appealing again but I still hope they don't make any more as I don't want it to get stale.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,1,1,12 July 2013
Dark Shadows," A good movie, but not what I was expecting.
","DARK SHADOWSI remember seeing this film was coming out in the cinema and I was really excited. I love waiting for a Tim Burton movie. Tim is my favourite director and I just love the feel of his movies.The movie is about a wealthy man who scorns a woman that works for him unknowing that she is a witch that curses him and turns him into a vampire. She buries him and leaves him there. 200 hundred years later he gets dug up and realises that times have changed and the witch is still around running the town. The battle for the town begins.I went to see this in IMAX when it was released, I remember liking it but being slightly disappointed. The trailer makes it look like a full on comedy, but it's not really. There are some very funny comedy moments in it, but most of them were in the trailer.The story was really good. I like the rivalry between the vampire and the witch. There is a sexual tension between them, but even though there is that tension there, he really doesn't like her. It is a weird relationship.The casting was very typical for a Tim Burton film. Johnny Depp stars as Barnabas. Johnny has starred in a lot of Tims films. I have read some negative comments about that, but I disagree. I see them working together and it is a winning combination. If a partnership works, then why break it up? If you look at the films they have made together I can honestly say that I like all of the films they have made... even the remakes that Tim has done. I am not a fan of remaking a film and I was very dubious about it when Tim started making remakes, but I do like the ones he has done. Helena Bonham Carter also stars in this with Johnny. I know... no big surprise. But again, it works. Michelle Pfeiffer, Jonny Lee Miller, Eva Green, Jackie Earle Haley, Bella Heathcote, Chloe Grace Moretz and Gulliver McGrath star. The acting was quite good throughout, but again, the annoying one was Chloe Grace Moretz. She has yet again proved she can't act. It is a shame, but I really don't see what people see in her. Her lines seem so forced and it feels like she is reading every word she says. It was good to see Michelle Pfeiffer in a Tim Burton film again. The last film the made together was Batman Returns. There is also a great cameo by Alice Cooper and Christopher Lee.It was also really good to see the original cast of the TV series made a small appearance. Jonathan Frid filmed his scene and unfortunately died before the film was released.The effects were really well done. The end of the movie is where the effects are really shown to it's full capacity. Eva Green's character starts cracking and it is really well done.The soundtrack to this film is great. The movie is set in the 1970s so all the way through the film you have some classic 70s songs. They really do go well with the film.This is a good film that is a lot of fun to watch... but don't see it thinking it is a laugh out loud comedy, it is more of a fantasy film.I will give this 7 out of 10.'You may strategically place your wonderful lips upon my posterior and kiss it repeatedly!'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,0,2,1 September 2014
Shooter," Great film... great cast!
","SHOOTER.I really enjoyed this movie.It is a great thriller about a sniper who gets framed for an attempted assassination on the president of the United States.The people who frame him try to kill him but he gets away and is on the run.It stars Mark (Marky Mark) Wahlberg. He plays a great part in this film. He is generally a good actor anyway and does another good job in this.The supporting cast is also very good. Michael Pena is a great FBI agent in this film... I really like his character. Kate Mara plays his friends girlfriend. She plays the part well, but I don't think she would have helped him so quickly in real life.Danny Glover is also in this movie... I Like Danny... he has made some great movies. He is really good in this too, but I don't know why he has got a lisp in some scenes... i actually thought something was wrong with him.Finally, it has Ned Beatty in it... Every time I see him in a movie I can't help but think of him playing Otis from Superman... I keep expecting him to say 'Yes sir, Mister Luthor.' Haha!The story was good, the acting was good and the action was good. I honestly don't have anything bad to say about this movie. It's not the best action/thriller I have ever seen, but it was very entertaining.I will give this film an 8 out of 10. This movie is definitely one of Marks better films.For more of my reviews, please check out my Facebook page.http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",8,0,1,25 November 2012
The Woman in Black," A really good film. Don't let the 12 rating put you off.
","THE WOMAN IN BLACKThis is a very good movie. I fully expected to see it and think it was not very good, but it was a pleasant surprise.The movie is about a guy who has to go and sort out the paperwork at a house where the owner has died. The problem is, the house is haunted. Because he has entered the house, the ghost is taking revenge on everyone in the town.The trailer always interested me with this movie, and seeing as the legendary Hammer Horror company did this film, I had to see it. 2 things were on my mind when I went to the cinema to originally see it. First of all, the movie is a horror film but is only rated 12... how could it be a horror? It is very psychological. There is not much scary to see in the film, the whole thing is in the atmosphere in the movie. Secondly I thought, can Daniel Radcliffe get past Harry Potter with a career? Can he really act? Well, the answer to both questions is a big yes. Daniel acted very well. I thought he did a brilliant job and hope to see him in more roles in the future.The horror element obviously wasn't that scary due to it being a 12 rating, but I did like the woman in black character. She was very subtle in places and when she crept up on Daniel, it was creepy.The acting was great by everyone. The movie stars Daniel Radcliffe, Ciaran Hinds & Janet McTeer.This film is best watched with all the lights out in the dark and the volume up high.The effects are very good. The ghosts looked great and were all very spooky looking. I will give this film 7 out of 10.'I believe the most rational mind can play tricks in the dark.'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,0,1,22 December 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Good film but not the best!
","THE DARK KNIGHT RISESI saw this in the IMAX when it first came out... I really liked it but still left feeling a little disappointed. When I watched this last night, I felt the same.It is a really good film, the action is great and the characters are cool... I am a big Batman fan... he is by far my favourite superhero.There are a few things I am not keen on in this film. It is pretty slow going sometimes... I wish it could have been a bit more action and a bit more Batman. It felt like Christian Bale was more Bruce Wayne in this film. He hardly wore the famous suit at all. More Batman in a Batman movie is always good.Bane was awesome... I know a lot of people didn't like his voice in this film, but I loved it. I thought his voice gave him a more sinister look. I was not very happy with Catwoman though... too much of a good guy. Catwoman should be a bad guy, end of.I also was not impressed with the ending of the movie. I was hoping the ending would have had a better clash.I know there are a lot of bad points, but to be honest it is still a great film. The casting was spot on... even Liam Neeson shows up again.To me, the Tim Burton Batman movies are still the best. But thats because they were made to look more comic, where this trilogy has been made to look more realistic (or as realistic as Batman can get).I would have to say this is a very rare occasion with this trilogy... part 2 of the trilogy is actually better than the original. Very very rarely does any sequel outdo the original... but The Dark Knight does it.I will give this film a 7 out of 10...Very good, but not as good as The Dark Knight.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,2,7,20 January 2013
Blade Runner," Very good... I hated it the first 2 times I watched it.
","BLADE RUNNER: DIRECTOR'S CUTThis is the third time I have seen this film. I originally watched it about 20 years ago on VHS... I hated it. I then forgot most of the movie and watched it again about 10 years ago... I hated it. Again I forgot the whole movie... the only thing I remembered about this film was that I hated it. But a friend from work told me that it is a classic and it is his favourite film of all time. I know this movie is highly regarded by so many movie fans and finally I am starting to see why. I really enjoyed it.The story is about a retired Blade Runner (a cop who is assigned to find and kill replicants) who is forced to come out of retirement to find 4 escaped replicants. A replicant is a human clone designed and created for use in colonies as slaves with a 4 year life span. These 4 replicants have made their way to Earth to find their maker to try and make their lives longer.The story is very good. It is based on a book called 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' and is made really well.The visuals of this is amazing. I loved the futuristic look and the landscapes were beautiful. It has an awesome 80s feel to it which is one of the best feelings in a movie for me. There are still talks of a sequel to this film which I think would be a mistake. It is not the 80s anymore and that is one of the things that made this great. The new one would feel too modern and would just not have the same effect... just like Star Wars episodes 1-3.The films starred Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Daryl Hannah & M. Emmet Walsh. Everyone did a great job. Especially Rutger. He has a real creepy look about him that I feel he brings to most of the roles he has played.I loved the toys that the character Sebastian made. I thought they were a fantastic part of this movie and really helped to make the movie more fun.I did find that the movie was slow in places... there were quite a few scenes where there was a lot of thinking and just looking. And the blues/jazz soundtrack was not the greatest... but it kind of felt right with the mood of the film.The film was made by Ridley Scott who is a genius with Sci-Fi films as we know seeing Alien and more recently Prometheus. Ridley is a legend and I hope me makes more movies soon. Ridley is also apparently lined up to direct the new Blade Runner film... whether it be a sequel or remake... no-one knows as of yet.I will give this film 7 out of 10... which is really good seeing as before watching it this time, based on the last 2 times of seeing it, I would have given it 2 out of 10.'More human than human is our motto.'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,0,3,14 July 2013
Saving Mr. Banks," A very touching film... but how true is it?
","SAVING MR. BANKSAs soon as I saw the trailer for this movie, I knew I wanted to see it. I am a big Disney fan and love all the classic Disney animated movies. I also love some of the live action movies too, especially Bedknobs and Broomsticks and Mary Poppins.This film is about a famous author named Pamela Travers. Pamela's biggest seller was the Mary Poppins novels. The film is centered around the period in her life when she stopped writing and Walt Disney kept contacting her about giving him the film rights to the book. Pamela was not interested and hated the idea of Walt bringing Mary to life as she hated his movies. She is not a fan of his animation. Finally her accountant talked her into flying to America to meet with Walt and maybe sign the rights over to him. She agrees on the condition that she has final say in ever decision that is made about the movie and characters and one of the stipulations was 'No animation'. Pam makes it very hard work for Walt and his team.This is a drama about her American trip, but even more it is a drama about her childhood. The film makes it look like she was haunted by her past. Her relationship with her father who she adored and his troubles. The movie is very well made. It is very sad. Saving Mr. Banks is not a feel good movie. I left the cinema just feeling sorry for her even though her character is not very likable. You grow to really like her as the film goes on, but she really is a mean old woman. But I am thinking she was only mean because he is so attached to the character in her book that she does not want to let go or even give anyone else the chance to portray her. There are some very funny moments in the movie though. Some of the things she says and the way she acts towards Walt's' film makers was brilliant. Pam was a woman that took no mess. She knew what she wanted and had no problem saying what she thought. She has some fantastic comedy moments.The film stars Tom Hanks as Walt Disney and Emma Thompson as Pamela Travers. The whole cast was brilliant. I thought Tom did a great job as Walt. He played with passion and conviction. The star of the movie for me though was Emma. I thought she should get top billing for this as her performance was by far the best. Her character was very believable and she played it to perfection. Colin Farrell played Pam's father. I am not a massive Colin Farrell fan, but I understand he is a good actor. He did a very good job in this too and for an Irish man he really can pull off an English accent well.The film does drag on a little bit. There is far too many flashbacks for my liking. I know that we are learning about her childhood and the troubles her family had but it just felt that the first half of the film was stretched out a bit because of it. But it did help with the connection of the characters. I suppose the main problem I had with the movie was the ending. I have read up about Pamela Travers and from everything I have read, it turns out the ending of this film is not 100% accurate. I don't want to put spoilers in my reviews so I won't mention anything that happens, but I am just disappointed that they did not stick to the truth fully but then no bio pic ever does. I suppose that being made by Disney was also the reason for it they will not make themselves look bad. But anyone that knows anything about Disney knows that they have had a very controversial past but this does not take away my memories of watching their cartoons as a kid and adult and loving every second of them. They know how to make a decent family movie and I love them all the same.My favourite part of the movie was the credits. As you watch the film you see the Pam told Walt that she will only help them with the film as long as every meeting was taped. During the credits, you can hear one of the recordings from the meeting. It was awesome watching a movie about this woman and seeing the hell she puts these guys through, and then to hear the real recording at the end of the film. It was a brilliant touch by Disney and really nice to hear it it was also topped off by the photos that they showed of the real Pam Travers with the real Walt Disney too.I will give this film 7 out of 10.'Stop! Mary Poppins is not for sale! I won't have her turned into one of your silly cartoons.'",7,3,9,19 November 2013
Thor: The Dark World," A good sequel.
","THOR: THE DARK WORLDAs sequels go, I was expecting this to be quite bad... but to be honest, I liked it as much as the original movie.The movie is about Jane Foster. Jane was the love interest in the original movie and she has now been hot with something that has given her a strange power. Thor returns to Earth to protect her from the evil Dark Elves.This is a very worthy sequel. It was made after the Avengers Assemble, so if you are going to watch these movies in order, then watch the original Thor, then the Avengers Assemble and then this.The story is really good. I like the way that Jane has got more involved in the fight this time around. Thor takes her up to Asgard to protect her so most of the movie is set up there. As I have stated in the original review, the vision of Asgard is so colourful and beautiful so I was happy that a lot more of the movie was set up there.As before, the effects were very good and the fighting scenes were great. The action was a lot of fun and kept you glued to the screen.The main thing I didn't like about this film was how quickly Thor had forgiven Loki for what he had done. Thor needs his help and understand that, but he should never forgive him for destruction and death he has caused in the last 2 movies. It just didn't feel right.The movie stars Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Anthony Hopkins, Tom Hiddleston and Christopher Eccleston. The acting seemed better in this movie than the last one. It was great to see Christopher in this. I have always liked him and thought he did a great job in this.The make-up looked great too... the creatures looked really creepy and fit in really well into the movie.This is a good movie and if you enjoyed the original one then you will like this.'Well done, you just decapitated your Grandfather.'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,1,1,6 May 2014
RED," A good movie, but nothing memorable.
","REDI had seen this before when it first came out, but I didn't remember too much about it. Now I have watched it again I can see what it was forgetful. Don't misunderstand me, I liked it. For me it was just nothing too special.The movie is about 4 retired assassins who find themselves on the hit list so they come out of retirement to save themselves.This is a comedy thriller. Not usually two categories that you get together, but it went well. There was a lot of action which I liked and the relationship the characters had was very good. The characters all liked each other but at some stage of their lives had all tried to kill each other too so there is a lack of trust between them at first. That made for amusing comedy. There was not too much to laugh about in this film though. It was not really laugh out loud funny.The action was great. I loved the fighting scenes and the gun fights. All of it was very well done.The casting was also very good for this. The only doubt I had was with Bruce Willis. Yes, Bruce is getting on a bit, but he still looks quite young so I struggled to see him as someone who would have retired because he was too old. It just didn't seem right to me. Bruce still did a good job though. He is still the action legend that I grew up watching. Other cast members were Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman﻿, Karl Urban & Mary- Louise Parker. Every one of these actors did a great job and really worked well together. The star of the movie for me though has to have been John Malkovich. His character really was a little crazy and John played it perfectly. He was by far the funniest character in the movie and I enjoyed watching him the most.The only down side to this movie really, as I said at the beginning of this review, is that it is forgetful. There is nothing in this movie that I have not seen before. Yes this is well done and a lot of fun to watch, but there is nothing new in here. The twists were very predictable and there was only one moment in the movie that I did not see coming. Everything else just seemed very safe and straight forward. But it is still good to see for a night in with your friends and you want to watch an action filled movie that you don't really need to concentrate on.I will give this film 6 out of 10.'Frank, I never thought I'd say this again. I'm getting the pig!'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",6,1,1,27 November 2013
The Purge," I know a lot of people didn't like it, but I really liked it.
","THE PURGE  I have been waiting to see this movie for quite a while now. I saw the  trailer a while ago and loved the idea. This is a highly anticipated  movie for me.  America is a peaceful country since a new law has been introduced for  one night a year, all crime is legal! The police, ambulance and fire  services are not available for 12 hours. So during that night, as you  can imagine is hell. The whole country has turned into a riot murder,  rape, arson, robbery you name it it is happening and is legal. One  wealthy family lock their house down with really high tech equipment  and everything is fine during the night of purging until the young son  hears someone screaming for help and decides to open the security to  help him now their house is targeted by a large group.  It is a very good thriller and it did not disappoint. There were a few  moments where it was very predictable I saw a few of the moments  coming before they happened but there were also a few surprise  moments. The ending is really good too.  The movie stars Ethan Hawke, Lena Headey, Max Burkholder, Adelaide Kane  & Edwin Hodge. Everyone did a great job in their roles but the only  problem I have is with Lena. She did a great job in this, but  unfortunately I think she has been typecast as a bad person. I have  seen her in Game of Thrones & Dredd and she plays a mean bitch in both  of them and she plays it well. I just didn't quite believe she was the  housewife victim she was portraying in this movie. But the star of the  movie for me was Rhys Wakefield. He played the leader of the group  outside and he was great. The way he played the character was actually  really polite and nice, but with a very mean streak. I thought it was a  nice touch and he did a brilliant job.  The action is great and there are some nice twists. Seeing as the whole  movie is set in one house, it gives it a sense of entrapment. You don't  get bored either it has a great suspense about it.  Excellently shot and well made. I am so glad that this highly  anticipated movie was not a disappointment for me. I was hoping to see  it in the cinema, but I missed it apparently it was in the cinema for  only a week. It didn't have enough publicity really this film deserved  a lot more publicity as I believe it would have been more popular that  it is.  I will give it 7 out of 10.  'Incoming reports show this year's Purge has been the most successful  to date, with the most murders committed.'",7,39,56,13 October 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," A good sequel, just too long.
","THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIREThis is part 2 of the Hunger Games movies, so that automatically usually means that it will not be as good as the first one. It is very rare that a sequel is better then the original...The movie continues on from the original movie... Katniss and Peeta won the last Hunger Games and they are about to go on a tour of the Districts. There is a rebellion against the politicians and the games, so the president decides that Katniss must die as she is the person the rebellion has chosen to be their leader. The next games would be different. The participants are previous champions. Katniss and Peeta are going back in. Will they survive again? The thing I liked about this too is there are some people they can trust but some they can't... It is very good watching this wondering if the people they are talking too are trustworthy. It keeps you guessing.The main thing I felt about this movie was it was too long. It is on for about 2 and a half hours which is not normally a problem, but the first hour of this film really dragged out. My favourite part of these film are the games themselves, but the games do not begin until roughly 75 minutes into the film. The first half of the movie i felt could have been shorter.The film is very good. I enjoyed it a lot and I liked the new idea of the battle ground. It is set in a different place this time and I loved the twists that presented themselves throughout the movie. It seems they are not just trying to survive against the other contestants... they have other problems to deal with too.The casting was again very good. As far as I could tell, everyone from the original movie returned for the sequel with a few new faces. Jennifer Lawrence﻿ played Katniss. Jennifer was very good in this movie again. SHe is a very talented actress and I can see her in a lot of movies in the future. Josh Hutcherson﻿ played Peeta. I thought that Josh did a great job too. I really feel sorry for his character. He clearly loves Katniss a lot and will do anything to protect her, but she does not seem to have the same feelings, but she will protect him from anything. It is a weird relationship. haha Other cast members that did a fantastic job were Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland and the late, great Philip Seymour Hoffman.It will be very interesting what they do with Philip's character as he still had one more scene to shoot for the next movie. I hope they don't replace him or make a mistake with the character.The violence was again very good in this film. Some scenes were harsh but still very well done. This is a dark movie.I will give this film 7 out of 10.'Remember who the real enemy is.'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204",7,0,11,9 February 2014
Cloud Atlas," nice but weird
","CLOUD ATLASWow this is a confusing movie.Visually it is a beautiful film. There are so many gorgeous scenes. Lovely colours and great effects. The only thing is, there are so many different stories in this movie and it goes on for so long that I just could not understand it all fully. I am not the only one I watched this film with 3 other people and all of us were the same. I recently watched an interview with the cast from the film, and they were asked if they could explain the movie to everyone, and all of them said that they couldn't explain it.Speaking of the cast, it is very impressive. Tom Hanks is one of the main cast members Tom is one of my top 5 favourite actors. He has made so many great films, and this is good, but not up there with his best. Halle Berry is also in it. She does a great job. I find Halle to be a bit hit and miss. She is a great actress, but she has not got the best judgment in choosing movies. It also has Jim Broadbent in it. I know Jim from various TV shows and a couple of movies and I have to admit, this is his best role to date. Susan Sarandon also makes a couple of appearances. But he big surprise of the film has to be Hugh Grant I am not a big fan of his. He has made some good movies, but I don't really rate him as an actor. He has been typecast as a romcom actor and all of his films are very wet. But not in this film. He does a great job and it shows he can do other things other than romantic comedies. I know he was in Extreme Measures which was not a comedy, but he struggled through that. He looked so uncomfortable and out of his zone, but in Cloud Atlas he is awesome.The film is on for nearly 3 hours another long movie. Why are all the films these days so long? What happened to the days where a film could be on for 80-90 minutes and that was good films do not need to be dragged out to 3 hours. This film does feel long too sometimes when I go and see a movie and it is a 3 hours epic, it doesn't feel that long and the time flies but not here. It felt very long. That is not necessarily a bad thing, I did enjoy the movie, I just didn't understand it. I could not explain the story to you sorry.I will give this film a 6 out of 10...Too long, very confusing but visually very nice and some great performances.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",6,0,2,11 March 2013
Jackie Brown," This is a lot better than I remember.
","JACKIE BROWNI first saw this movie when it was first released and I hated it. I thought it was boring. now after 14 years I decided to try it again...The movie is about a flight attendant named Jackie Brown. She gets caught up in a huge arms deal and decides to risk everything to help herself other than anyone else.The movie is quite slow going. There is not a great deal of action in it, but the character building is brilliant. A lot of time is spent getting to know the characters and dialogue. That is one thing I love about Quentin Tarantino﻿s movies. The man really knows how to build a character. The dialogue in all of his movies is what makes him stand out from everyone else. This is one of the reasons why he is one of the best.Another thing that is really good with this movie and a lot of Tarantinos films is the soundtrack. I read that he bases his films around the soundtracks, and this has some classic songs throughout.Even though there is not a lot of action, you can't help be get drawn into the story and trying to guess what Jackies next movie is. All the way through the film I was trying to guess what she was doing and who she was actually helping. It is a good film to keep you thinking.The casting was fantastic. Every single actor did a great job in this movie and they all deserve some credit. Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Forster, Robert DeNiro, Bridget Fonda & Michael Keaton star in this movie. It was also a nice surprise to see a young Chris Tucker and also Sid Haig appear too.The main thing I noticed from this film compared to most of Tarantinos others was the lack of violence. There were not many scenes where the violence was high. This is a very subtle film but runs very smoothly and very enjoyable.I will give this film 7 out of 10.'Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga does a nigga a favor, then, BAM!, hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gots to be that kinda nigga.'For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,1,2,6 May 2014
The Cabin in the Woods," A great film...
","THE CABIN IN THE WOODSWow... this film surprised me. I was expecting it to be a typical slasher film... basically another Evil Dead wannabe... but it was different... and I loved it!The movie is about a bunch of kids who go up to a cabin in the woods for a small vacation (yeah I know... sounds all too similar so far) but then they accidentally bring a group of zombies to life. The difference with this film though, is they are all being watched and it is all part of a set up by a company that is sacrificing them without them knowing.The film is very entertaining and had some great bloody moments. The deaths were very cool.The effects were great and the monsters/zombies were awesome. I loved they way this film didn't follow every other horror film. I also think the ending is brilliant.The acting was OK mostly... there is one guy in the movie (Fran Kranz) that I think could have done better, but his bad performance was funny which added to the movie. He might have even played it bad on purpose for comedy value.Other cast members were Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth, Anna Hutchison, Jesse Williams, Richard Jenkins & Bradley Whitford.Chris Hemsworth just seems to be in everything these days... he is a good actor, but he has made some bad decisions... he has made some movies that I have not been impressed with. But not this one.I will give this film 7 out of 10.A very good movie that was a mixture of Night of the Living Dead, Evil Dead and The Cube.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7,0,2,5 June 2013
The Godfather," Good movie... but I have seen better.
","THE GODFATHERA long time ago I started to watch these movies and got about an hour into The Godfather and was really bored so I turned it off... until now.I liked it... but it was long! I'm pretty sure it could have been shrunk down to 2 hours.There are some really good scenes in this movie. The hits that are made on various people were really well done for it's time. Don't get me wrong, you could see the blood wasn't real, but back when this was made i am pretty sure they didn't have the effects and make up we have now.The story was really good, but it was a very slow paced movie. It took a while for the movie to get going. There is a lot of dialogue and if you listen to it properly and get into the movie you will enjoy it.The Corleone family is a family you don't want to mess with. They take no prisoners. If you are their friends they will look after you, but if you get on their wrong side, you won't live long enough to regret it.The casting was really good. Marlon Brando played the Godfather, Don Vito Corleone. This was the best role he has played that I have seen so far. Al Pacino played his son Michael. A brilliant performance. He looks so young in this film... I nearly didn't recognise him. James Caan played another son, Sonny. I am not a huge James Caan fan, but he did well in this movie.The Godfather is not the best gangster movie I have ever seen. I think Goodfellas is still the best in my opinion. But I can understand why this is a classic. This was probably the first big gangster film.I loved the soundtrack too... the theme to this film is legendary. I have listened to it a lot. Slash plays it on guitar really well at his concerts.I will give this film a 7 out of 10.A good movie, but a mission to watch due to the length. I will be watching The Godfather Part II very soon.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204",7,1,2,17 January 2013
