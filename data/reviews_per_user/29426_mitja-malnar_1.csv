Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Cohen holds the mirror for us all.
","You have to admit that Borat is really something special. I wouldn't say the film is original, that no one thought of something like this before (Czech Dream, 2004), but it has a far-reaching consequences for comedy genre. Not only that it is hilarious, it also has some lessons for us all. There is not a doubt in my mind, that after megalomaniacal success, there will be raining with similar comedy movies. Cohen knew very well, that he can pull this one off only in USA. Most Americans aren't interested in the world outside their borders. Not knowing where many of the countries are, let alone knowing how people live there, allowed those Americans in the film really believe that a person like Borat could actually exist. If we all laugh at Cohen at first, now it's the other way around. If you aren't offended by some of Borat's humor - and you shouldn't be - you can see what is really the target here. It's stupidity. And what makes this movie great? Because it serves us the point he is trying to make with just that. Stupidity. We all should laugh not only to 'some stereotype', but also to ourself for believing in it. Let's all look in the mirror an come to terms with ourselves, we will be better people for it. Knowledge, respect amongst people is a foundation to world peace. Peace everybody.",8,3,11,15 November 2006
