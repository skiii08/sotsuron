Requiem for a Dream," Take a tour through the intensifying horror of consuming addiction.
","Requiem for a Dream follows the lives of four individuals who use drugs on Coney Island. As their dependency grows, their relationships start to set them apart. Each person develops their own unique brand of personal hell.All of Darren Aronofsky's past work has an underlying theme of obsession. In Black Swan, a ballerina puts everything including her mental stability on the line for the pursuit of perfection. In The Fountain, a doctor struggles through space and time to cure death. In Pi, a mathematician pushes the limits researching a number that could serve as the blueprint of the universe. Requiem for a Dream is no exception, following Harry (Jared Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), and his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) as they live out the life of heroin addicts. Harry's mother (Oscar nominated Ellen Burstyn) finds herself on a different fix, but the outcomes of all four characters are horrible and painful to watch.The style of the film is polished and cut frequently (it has more than double the cuts of an average movie). One of the most distinguishing aesthetics of Requiem for a Dream is the clever use of split screen. The dual screen isn't presented to show collages of multiple actions in plot, but to illustrate the mental divide between each person. Even though a connection seems to be present in certain scenes, the characters are separated by their true motives and growing individual dependencies.As beautifully and creatively put together this film is (the soundtrack is iconic as well), it is ironic that the majority of people watching already know the horrors of doing hard drugs. Requiem would be far more effective as a movie about self destructive substances to teens, but because of the explicit sex, language and violence it will never happen. If it were to be used in place of drug education videos, you certainly wouldn't see a classroom of sleepy eyed students waiting for the bell to ring.",9,0,1,7 February 2017
Being John Malkovich," 'You don't know how lucky you are being a monkey. Because consciousness is a terrible curse.'
","This film has a densely layered plot with plenty of insight into the human mind. John Malkovich is a vessel literally and metaphorically. The discovery of the portal amplifies the true nature of each character. Craig, the puppeteer, craves the acceptance of the public for his talent. Lotte, his wife, lives to care for her animals but ultimately wants a child. Maxine, the woman both Lotte and Craig claim to love, believes her beauty is worth the status she lacks. Malkovich is the means by which they believe happiness is possible.Being John Malkovich is very applicable to this digital age of live celebrity updates and involvement with the public. Many wish they were someone who had more freedom to do whatever they wanted in their relationships, profession, and overall life. Craig, Lotte, and Maxine are all out for themselves: seeing Malkovich as an opportunity and not a human being. Walking in someone else's shoes is traditionally viewed as a chance to understand another person, but in this case it is exploited for narcissistic agendas. Only one character in the movie has true compassion for other human beings, and it is Elijah, their pet monkey.",8,6,13,13 April 2017
