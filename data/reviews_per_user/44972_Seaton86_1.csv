United 93," Excellent!
","**** (out of ****) I saw this film at a free advance screening in Atlanta tonight and it was excellent-definitely one of the best films of the year so far. The tension and suspense are almost unbearable. The film's documentary style makes it seem like you are on the plane with these people. It was a very moving tribute to those who perished that fateful day. The opening scenes inspire a sense of dread as you see the passengers boarding the plane, as well as the scenes inside the FAA and NORAD centers which illustrated the almost criminal lack of communication between the two groups. Many people may choose to not see this film, and that is understandable. However, for those who are curious, be prepared for an emotionally draining but worthwhile look at what may have taken place that day.",10,16,37,25 April 2006
