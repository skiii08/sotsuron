Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," boring
","Honestly, I just knew that this movie won't live up to the three original ones. And I was right. The only things worth seeing in this movie were the out-of-this-world special effects. The studio people did a really great job. Otherwise, I wouldn't really recommend the movie to anyone but the fans. The Matrix was a much better sci-fi film than The Phantom Menace.",Null,0,1,30 May 1999
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A Star Wars rip-off? Geez...
","To all those people referring to CTHD as a Star Wars rip-off... geez... stop being so ignorant! CTHD was adapted from a Chinese wuxia novel that is about 100 years old!! The martial arts novels have long been an important tradition in Chinese literature, and the theme of the 'young trainee and the master' had existed long before George Lucas even got his idea for Star Wars. Why don't you go ask Lucas where he got his brilliant idea for the Stars Wars series?",Null,0,0,11 March 2001
