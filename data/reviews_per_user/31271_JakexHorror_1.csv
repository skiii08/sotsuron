Insidious: Chapter 2," A super natural haunted house sequel.
","In 2010's insidious Acclaimed horror duo James Wan And Leigh Whannell, creators of the SAW franchise unleashed upon us a terrifying take on the haunted house movie. Insidious, told the story of a family plagued by unwanted visitors, The Supernatural Kind. Fast forward to 2013 and now we have Insidious Chapter 2. The Lambert family have now moved from the house and moved on from all the experiences they had in it. Josh, Renai and their three children are all safe, and safe with Josh's Mom. The story starts with a young Josh and explains how he has the gift for astral projection, which with the help of Elise, he eventually suppresses this and forgets about his gift. Just when the family think they are safe and their horror has passed them, things begin to go bump in the night. But this time its not little Dalton who's in trouble, its Josh himself. Renai and new character, Carl get help for Josh after they both sense theirs something not quite right about him. They set out to free Josh and the family from the evil that haunts them. Told through a series of story strands its interesting to see the direction the Duo have taken with this and everything builds on top of each other to create an interesting narrative which combines the best of the first film and expands on the story of the first one and the women in black from the photos, its interesting to see the character development portrayed. Combining the best elements from The Shining, Poltergeist and Psycho proves to be a successful formula and nothing seems forced or contrived here. Tying in perfectly with the first one, I found myself shocked at some of the twists and how it tied perfectly into the first film. If you are expecting edge of your seat scares then this film will disappoint you. The jump scares are effect due to the camera work by James Wan. The ending leaves the door open for a sequel, it will be interesting to see where the series will go now Wan has bowed out from the Horror Genre, if this is his final swan song for the genre then he has done a phenomenal job and can bow out gracefully.",8,8,16,13 September 2013
