The New World," Q'Orianka Kelcher is a phenomenon
","Hers was the most powerful performance I've seen in a good, good long time. She can more clearly state what her character is thinking using her eyes and face than if she had actually spoken. I am dumbstruck that this was a 14 year old girl in her first major production; My only regret is that it is unlikely to see her execute such a mature, and subtle role. Instead of Christian Bale (who also made a believer out of me with this film), to see her opposite a lesser leading man in a blockbuster with explosions and car chases would offend me deeply. This movie fulfilled the contract with the viewer that says if you just willfully suspend your disbelief for a bit, I will take you somewhere or somewhen you've never been. Q'Orianka was largely responsible for that. This movie blew me away, and I hope to see this amazing actress again soon in a worthy role. Perhaps the next Fast and Furious?",9,3,7,25 June 2006
