The Equalizer," Insanely good movie
","I have DREAMED of this movie to be created. I have dreamed to see on the big screen a movie as powerful as The Equalizer! It sucked the last air out of my lungs while watching it, and it left me ... hope-full. Hope, that there will always be someone who cares. That there will always be someone who cares enough! Enough, to go out to serve and protect the disadvantaged ones. I do hope the 'tyrants' around the globe would watch this movie. I cannot imagine something worse, that the mighty one breaking the spirit of those less fortunate. If someone has power, then this power should be used only in service to the others, nothing else. Great acting, great fighting scenes, great directing! It did thrill all my senses, it made me think, it provoked me in many ways. I do not buy movies on DVD, BUT this one will be purchased and played again. I saw it yesterday and I am still buzzing all over :)",10,6,18,28 September 2014
