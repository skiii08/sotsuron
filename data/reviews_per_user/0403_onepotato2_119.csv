Saturday Night Fever," surprisingly trashy artifact
","The moment is firmly over for this, but I'm not a joiner, so I'm just getting around to it. I guess I'll get to Rocky this week too.This is much more grotesque than I imagined it would be. Watching insecure, self-involved, low-class Brooklyn Italians is about as appealing as it sounds. The slim plot stops completely for the dance numbers just like a musical. The idiot who grows up (a little) storyline just doesn't hold much interest. Every aspect of this study of 70s meathead priorities is grotesque; unsubtle stereotypes, travolta in a speedo, hideous chicks, fried hair, terrible dancing, people who couldn't find a beat if you were pounding them with a hammer. This is like junior Scorcese. This is the culture that needs to be saved from gay marriage? I still know meatheads who get on the dance floor and make the pointy move from this. Somebody needs to strangle them.",3,3,13,17 January 2008
Angels & Demons," Some interesting stuff
","I'm not a fan of Ron Howard or Dan Brown ...but I have to give it to them for this one. Early on, buy-in comes slow, and it's easy to roll your eyes (anti-matter again? ...that old chestnut?) but it steadily gets better. I thought it slightly better than a potboiler, and it has a stunning climax. As opposed to an emotional wallop (Your girlfriend is the descendant of Christ) it has a WOW aspect. Let's just say if you mention a new kind of bomb in an action movie, that bomb is both, a) required to go off, and b) be more interesting than the lat three hundred bombs, when it does. The climax is followed by a coda that lasts a good 15 minutes; and its machinations are very interesting, but which come (strangely) after you're ready for it to conclude. There's not a single development in the first two thirds of the film that's original or interesting. Everything good is in the coda.This one takes place in Italy rather than France. It balances the mockery of religion and its hypocritical materialism; with a real reckoning of its power... before retreating safely to establishment respect (Booo! A cop-out). The rapid, on-the-fly analysis of 10 unremarkable Rennaisance sculptures offers nothing to match the breathtaking analysis of a single artists most famous paintings from da Vinci Code. Robert Langdon the 'symbologist' has precious few moments to detect/decipher symbols. The time frame (4 hours) is ludicrous. There's no way so much ground could be covered in 4 hours. And who are these villains that treat murders like puzzles?When action/effects movies end, the mind usually reels as endless credits go by, implying that thousands of people got paid, but no one had much taste or brains. This was the opposite for me. The craft of FX movie-making is definitely on display. The hordes that must have worked on this receive my appreciation. This is a triumph of generally inconspicuous green screen work, punctuated by some nice FX sequences.",8,2,5,15 December 2009
Vertigo," Swirling Void
","Back in the 80s when this film wasn't available, I read so much gushing praise for it that made me want to see it very badly. Finally the rights were resolved and five missing Hitchcock films were re-released.Despite my eagerness to see it, I was absolutely shocked to find it plodding, unintentionally amusing (the Saul Bass nightmare with Stewarts floating head) technically awful (those terrible, terrible rear-screen shots for the driving pursuit sequence.) and so gimmicky; that junky, clunky disclosure letter (as a narrative device) that gets torn up after Scotty finds Judy. And the powerfully unsubtle-ly Freudian Midge who just falls off the face of the earth around the halfway point.For the color restoration version I was more impressed. This must have been a factor of seeing it in a theater and coming to appreciate Stewarts anguished, pre-method performance.After watching all the parts of it I could bear last week I'm back to my earlier assessment of it. Technically it's just so crappy looking; the haze in the graveyard. Jimmy Stewart as the worst detective ever. 'Oh my God Kim Novak is two feet in front of me.... I'll just stand very still.' And the introductory malarkey with trances & Gavin Elster works exactly once; on further viewings it just sits there, in the way.Vertigo receives one alternate reading very well and that's about it for the enormous investment of your time. I find this movie artless. Give me Rear Window anytime.But you didn't need my 'me too!' vote. That's what all the other easy raves are here for.",6,4,11,22 June 2007
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," limp
","I love the characters Ali G and Borat on Cohen's show. Both of them reveal painful truths about our cultures (Brit and American) by burying our hero in apparently ignorant characters that elicit authentic ignorance from real people. Cohen's character Bruno (who will have his own movie before long), a gay club-kid/fashionista, is much, much less interesting. When all you do as a straight comedian in lampooning a gay character is act like a shallow sissy, you're probably working something out for yourself (wink wink), but you're not entertaining me. All this character says to me is that Sasha Baron Cohen has some need to dress up and act like a sissy every now and then. (Let us know how that works out Sasha.) At any rate the Bruno character is infinitely staler than the other two. The show was funny because it was smart. This movie is beneath me on both counts. By the time I rented it, the accolades had been piled so high, and the value of the concept so overstated, that it couldn't live up to the hype. I couldn't even finish this. The whole movie is set in motion when Borat decides he has to track down Pamela Anderson after seeing Baywatch. Oh stop... ha ha ha... my sides are splitting. The last time I heard something that funny, I fell out of my horseless carriage. Yeah it's actually that limp. Ensuing jokes are set up even limper.'Borat' heads into shallow one-joke 'SNL movie' territory very early. Much like Little Miss Sunshine it takes potshots at people we all already agree have poor values. There it was just the kiddy pageant set. Here everyone is an idiot.So let's examine the naked wrestling scene that audiences found so amusing: Here's how I understand the offense-scale of these viewers: Gay sex is gross; but something which is ninety-five percent of the way to gay sex, involving simulated sex positions (analingus) with a repulsive obese man with a hairy back, a flabby white paunch, floppy man-boobs and droopy buttocks is a new height in humor? So actual sex performed by attractive guys, is more distasteful than simulated sex between repulsive ones. You'll have to show me how I reset my taste & values, so I can get my head around that one.At one point Cohen almost breaks character when a fat black hooker he has used to humiliate herself and others, says his name correctly as they say goodnight. He registers a look that's more thoughtful than Borat should, remarking 'You said my name right.' The moment and the way it's played is already borderline, and then the movie cheesily underscores the scene with schmaltzy 'message' music.The critics who raved over this are just so many squares who came to the Sasha Baron Cohen party late, but want credit for being hip. This is not a smart movie. I wouldn't even call it outrageous. It's the same limp movie that TV-to-film comedians have been making for three decades.This is desperate. Most of you fell for it.",2,4,9,15 March 2007
Lucky Number Slevin," I liked it
","Despite this movies problems (conveniently listed below*) I enjoyed it. It has style, maybe too much. It has quite a payoff in the end. Willis and Harnett, both of whom I can take or leave, are pretty good here. The idea of two buildings taking on personalities is interesting. If you are on the fence about renting it, I'd say give it a try. Problems (and spoilers): * It's supremely violent and unethical before you learn the rationale for it, which you may decide does or doesn't validate the excess. * Arbitrary moral code: Lucy Liu is o.k., in the end, with Josh and Bruce killing her neighbor, Nick? So now the family of this poor jerk they kill (for the Kansas City Shuffle) is entitled to exact their revenge on Willis & Hartnett? Or it's o.k. to kill that schmo because we don't know him and he's in debt?* There's a horrid, scenery-chewing performance by Ben Kingley as an ingratiating Jewish gangster. He seems incapable of anything else since Sexy Beast.* The death that 'doesn't actually occur' occurs twice in this movie. I'd love to never see this device used again, and any author who uses it should have a computer keyboard shoved up his anus. This movie is too clever for a ruse this stupid and exhausted. Did MgGuigan pick it up from Danny Aiello's asinine 'miraculous non-death' in Hudson Hawk, another Willis movie, albeit a very poor one?",6,0,1,16 April 2007
The Ring," Your actual fright may be less than advertised...
","For better and for worse, The Changeling has influenced every 'ghost story' film since 1980. It was an OK movie with perhaps three good scares, but it initiated a formula which is now exhausted: Nancy Drew type clues are discovered (a secret, an old well, a hidden room, an illegitimate child, a spirit who cannot rest) and lead to other Nancy Drew type discoveries, eventually leading to a pat, unsatisfying resolution. Hollywood spends more time trying to convince you old ideas are fresh, than it would take to devise a new idea. As regurgitated in the Sixth Sense, Ghost, Session 9, the Devils Backbone, The Shining, The Others, A Stir of Echoes, The Lady in White, Sleepy Hollow, 13 Ghosts, Ghost Story, The Mothman Prophecies, Dark Water, The Fog, Flatliners, Poltergeist & any episode of MTVs fear... etc. there is no one left on the planet who doesn't GET IT. You know the story arc before you set foot in the theater. All of these movies forego legitimate scares to instead 'touch' the viewer and put the deceased to rest. Freud has been very, very busy at the graveyard. Plodding procedure displaces fright. I can't even recall the last movie I was actually scared at. This is extremely tiresome. It coincides exactly with the emergence of the phrase 'bringing closure' pervading pop culture, and appearing in news stories that involve death, and it's that hoary goal that the modern ghost movie is preoccupied with. Unfortunately none of these movies offer you anything remotely frightening. It's post-psychological, 'let's-put-the-ghosts-spirit-to-rest' hokum. Whatever fear people are feeling at this lame crop of movies they're bringing along or they have very weak spines. What Hollywood desperately needs is a ghost story where no one gives a damn about putting a spirit to rest, in which the ghosts are evil, people die horrible deaths, and the film scares the hell out of the audience... and I'm not talking about the 'things suddenly appearing very close to the camera,' or the 'sudden loud phone ringing' variety.Although the batch of conceits in this movie are OK, the fatal choice is made to have the protagonist be a journalist with investigative skills, who seeks/finds/follows a well-worn (and interminable!!) path of ghostly clues. Could anyone in our solar system be surprised when they discover the spirit of someone wronged is at the core of the disturbances? Worse, this main story thread intrudes before we've even seen the myth play out with any minor character (No! That one doesn't count! All of it is off-screen). Before the myth even gets established we're on our way to solving it. How boring! It was very nice to see a cast of unknowns though. I can't imagine how awful this would have been with name talent in it. Brian Cox appears in a goofy part here. The movies absurd compression of time is a hoot. (The wife wears wears Victorian equestrian clothes, but her husband is still alive?) Perhaps best of all is an unintended (?) analogy about irresponsibilty in marketing. But all of this is insufficient to save the movie. I was revolted to see the wholesome nuclear family at the center of this movie escape their fate (seemingly) so I could not have been happier to see someone actually die when they finally did almost 2 hours into the movie, at which point it was way too little, too late.",Null,3,8,20 April 2004
Casablanca," Idealism behind cynicism
","When I first saw this as a young film snob, I liked it, and said it was important, but I didn't really know as much about human emotions, or the topics depicted as I thought. I found some scenes (the ones I was too young to understand) to slow it down; the 'morning after' dialog at the bazaar, the sale of the club to Greenstreet. All I really knew was that the surprise ending was regarded as a sentimental powerhouse.Now I find its storytelling structure to be so sleek and on-track that I seriously doubt the lore that says that pages of the script only arrived minutes before they had to be shot. It is a speedy, singular-minded machine that doesn't have an ounce of fat, that manages to be Bogart's best role and performance to boot.Fans attend viewings to hear iconic lines within a context that ingeniously frames its well-known, pithy phrases in relation to selflessness, patriotism and sentiment. The electrifying smack-down of the Nazis delivered to 'Le Marseilles' is one of the most rousing moments ever put on film. And it's kept in good company by boatloads of other famous scenes.It portrays patriotism in terms of idealism (not narrow-mindedness, victimization and/or hate) so even a liberal (the more idealistic of the two political viewpoints) can love it. This movie is a classic because it's an ennobling pleasure.",8,2,6,26 May 2008
Finding Neverland," Barrie Reassembled.
","When watching this movie, with it's deterministic cause and effect, wall-to-wall clichés and hackneyed sentiment, can anyone be so naive as to think that this is actually how Barrie's life played out? You watch it in a posture of disagreement. Hollywood biopics aren't based on the individual lives anymore, they're just rewrites of previously successful biopics. If Hollywood made a movie about your life it would be filled with such perfect synchronization that you'd barely recognize your own story. Any personal complexity would be obliterated by some all-explaining, simplistic backstory. Your story would resemble 'Rocky' because it's the only life-arc Hollywood knows how to produce anymore. We couldn't leave the audience pondering anything left open-ended as they exit. This movie doesn't trust an audience to figure things out without being led to them. I perceived the captain hook/mother reference eons before the movie literalized it for me. I could see the 25 kids twist coming for days.This is a completely average movie. Not horrible but not great. Hence it's likely to be showered with a few Oscars next year. There's nothing the Academy likes better than congratulating itself for finally noticing patterns put in place over the previous thirty years.From the New Yorker article 'Lost Boys' by ANTHONY LANE: 'Arthur Llewelyn Davies, also adored his boys, and it may be unfair of 'Finding Neverland' to omit him, for streamlining purposes, from the scene; by the time that Johnny Depp meets Kate Winslet, she is already a widow, whereas Arthur was very much alive when Barrie first entered the consciousnessand, little by little, the homeof the Llewellyn Davies family.'Finding Neverland' is a weepie. From the moment that Barrie met George and Jack, and started to ponder the means by which they might be rendered immortal, the story is sad, but the reality is even more dismal: 1907Arthur Llewellyn Davies dies from cancer of the jaw. 1910Sylvia dies of lung cancer. The five boys are orphaned; Barrie is made their guardian. 1915George is killed in the First World War, fighting with his regiment in Flanders. 1921Michael, an undergraduate at Oxford, is drowned while swimming with a friend. The two bodies, when recovered, are found clinging together.On April 5, 1960, Peter Llewellyn Davies, by then an esteemed publisher, threw himself under a subway train in London. We should not presume to read a mind in torment, but we may note in passing that, if he had lived another month, he would have reached the centenary of Barrie's birth and thus, one imagines, a fresh flurry of interest in 'Peter Pan''that terrible masterpiece,' in the words of Peter Llewellyn Davies.",4,47,75,30 December 2004
In Bruges," Doesn't Work
","I bought this DVD after viewing it once a few months back. I must admit my judgment was wrong. 'In Bruges' fails utterly to align its two conflicting urges; to be maudlin, and to be shocking. It's very amateurish. As an alternate take on the hit-man movie, it goes places the others don't, but it's not terribly interesting. It feels like a gay hit-man soap opera paid for by the Belgium tourism council (The voice-over intro which dispenses with the reason they're in Bruges in one line - before the movie even starts - is just pitiful). The two hit-men hug, they cry, they mope. I'm gay and this movie makes me squirm. It's about as much fun as watching two sulking gay guys pass the time while they iron out their relationship over a vacation. It's too elegiac and subdued to be much fun ...and too puerile to be much of a guilty pleasure.Author McDonagh revels in foul language but doesn't find much glee in it. And the movie becomes a clunky, ever more meaningless action-movie-cliché-machine for the last half hour. Post-'Sexy Beast' villains are all the same (Here it's Raelph Fiennes). The angry midget gag is stolen from 'Lost in Oblivion.'",3,7,20,31 March 2010
The Big Lebowski," Phoning it in
","There are all sorts of ways to make a bad movie. Excrescences as diverse as Home Fries, Showgirls, Nothing but Trouble & Dune come to mind. After hinting at true originality with their first effort (Blood Simple), the Coens chose instead to coast and make a certain type of bad movie over and over.It's clear that they make more effort than most of Hollywood. But success can lead to a standard & safe approach to the work. The Coens return to the studio after each release and exert the exact same effort, making a similar movie, shifting locales, emulating the known favorites of a genre, changing a detail here or there, including the required amount of eccentricity that their fans expect. All signs are painstakingly arranged for the perception that it's a fine film. Your reaction has been engineered into the equation.But the Coens efforts are identical and the movies suffer from a debilitating sameness. It's as if they are most concerned that the production levels match from movie to movie. Rather than trusting themselves to actually see and evaluate each addition to the Coen canon, a devoted group of film nerds eagerly wait to observe what genre has been been fed though the Coen Bros movie-pooping-machine so they can be the first to declare it a masterpiece. The endless feedback loop of praise and regurgitation has pretty much stopped the Coens development.It's clear that it's turned into just a job. The Big Lebowski is the film one would make after coming to resent even the intellectual laziness that produced the previous half-dozen pictures; the lousy, pointless work that inevitably follows a bunch of easy raves. I hated every insipid, overwritten, precious moment of this movie which I find astonishingly asinine.",Null,3,8,2 June 2004
Dawn of the Dead," comme ci, comme ca
","Generally I liked this movie better when it was called 'ALIENS!'This is roughly on a par with 28 Days Later which had a stupid 2nd act. This Dawn has its scares but I really hate cheap shots, and I get very tired of scripts in which people in new, possibly dangerous surroundings, split up (!?) to investigate individually. (say... that's been a terrific idea for decades!) Sadly, it's the whole cast is filled with dumb characters. A girl who traverses a crowd of thousands of zombies to save a dog. Sarah Polly witnesses how fast her husband transforms but can't figure out the bite is the problem? What's up with depicting the playboy as a snide gay guy? They're two different things! I never believed he liked chicks for minute. Just kill them all, NOW!People who are offended by the changes in the remake should 1) explain why a remake should be remade if nothing is rethought? If there's not new riffs to play with, why remake a movie? Did the shot by shot remake of Psycho earn your praise? 2) They should also view the 1978 flick again. I had such strong memories of that film that I thought a remake was a dumb idea. After renting it again, it's comically dated, with bad acting and effects. Remakes will occur - Accept reality.",4,1,3,2 January 2005
12 Monkeys," Standard noisy, overwrought Gilliam product
","I saw this last in 1998 and really disliked it. I thought I'd give it a second chance. I still dislike it, for the exact same reasons.Gilliam always offers viewers some neat-o production design which seems to be enough for his fans, but he never has a clue about the basics. He starts complicating his story before it's even established, and embroiders and embroiders; hoping he can escape his basic shallowness. ('It has to be important! It's elaborate!') He gets very serious before the audience is on board. Loudness, chaos, eye-popping sets, and cinematography, big acting...? It's all there. But thirty years into his career, those are still no substitute for a decent script, or depth of ideas. The self-important tone here suggests Gilliam believes the thoughtless raves he gets with each movie. In the end his bloated, overcooked stories always reveal his major goal is to throw 2o mawkish, Mannerist moments up on the screen. 12 Monkeys is just empty calories for your eyes. It's a big dumb, showy Hollywood movie of no importance.",1,40,95,22 May 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," waste of time
","I zipped over to Burbank to beat the L.A. heat and get three hours of free air conditioning watching this, but I couldn't bear this movie that long. It's a long incoherent jumble. With a plethora of sub-plots (all of them uninteresting) running into each other. At the point they cut back to Keira Knightley, whom the plot has abandoned for an hour or so, I could take no more and exited. I didn't care if I got to see Jack nibble on another toe-necklace, or if Davey Jones face-tentacles became calamari, the movie was lame, and there was no saving it. It was a crashing bore scripted and filmed incompetently.There's no reason that this should have the highest opening box office receipts.",1,3,4,29 April 2007
12 Angry Men," quickly goes astray
","For decades now, films about 'social issues' have been problematic; making conscientious viewers believe they've thought deeply about a noble cause, and getting them to applaud themselves for embracing some progressive value that they probably already support*. This movie, in considering the responsibility of jury duty, neglects a finer point (& a larger idea) which remains undramatised; the process of American justice is not designed to declare people innocent... it only concludes whether the prosecution succeeded or failed at proving a person guilty; this is reflected by the very specific terms, Guilty and Not Guilty. A suspect is freed when the prosecution hasn't made its case, not when the suspect is proved innocent. No one is ever declared 'innocent.' The difference is important (occasionally Not Guilty and Innocent are equivalent, but innocence is generally a higher standard). The jurors of '12 Angry Men' are confused about many things, but none moreso than this. The movie never clarifies this point. It would help these gentlemen immensely.At both ends of the spectrum - lynch mob to gee-whiz pushovers - the jury here utilizes thought-processes which are toxic to justice. The jerks are too interested in hanging. The 'bleeding hearts' - in the films parlance - are way too engaged in actively dismissing the whole case, not in merely detecting reasonable doubt. At one point Fonda has been able to discredit evidence (which is OK - a discovery supports this) and use a dicey method to disregard so much witness testimony (which is frankly, bizarre) that he might just as well start denying there was a victim, or that a crime occurred at all. 'What if the victim isn't dead?' and 'What if there was no body?' are only slightly more unreasonable than a few of his crazy, trial-negating suppositions.It remains a good idea for a movie. There are strong points (a moment when E.G. Marshall, as the reasonable opposition, quietly concedes is particularly powerful), and it's directed and shot well, but the script is so off-course that by the time the film ends most viewers will feel content that an innocent life has been saved, a moral determination not supported by the film, which is neutral concerning culpability. Worse, the offscreen case rings dramatically hollow when reassembled from the details we do get; it suggests some kind of flimsy, polemical courtroom, 'What on earth did these lawyers debate, if it wasn't the crime details? Was this a 4-minute trial?' I'm sure this movie had an impact on viewers likely to be called to jury duty, who WOULD prefer to wind things up so they could get to a ball game, but it does end up affirming that 12 people off the street are usually ignorant, and without some enlightened golden-boy on your jury (and a dramatic structure to reign them in) will hang your sorry ass. In a shocking example of tunnel-vision, the movie neglects to note that this nifty trick of persuasion might also be deployed by the morally un-righteous. To wit, couldn't just as interesting a scenario be imagined in which a juror whose motives are secretly nefarious, and who is intentionally trying to undermine the process, achieve the same reversal and get someone executed? Could one clever sociopath with a quick mind get a jury to reverse its verdict? That's a creepy, equally promising possibility which viewers aren't supposed to consider, but which is inherent in the premise, and which should have troubled a McCarthy-era audience. I think I'd actually like this movie if Fonda's moral value was left intentionally vague in the end, but it isn't. His righteousness is endorsed by heraldic music on the soundtrack and just so there's no mistaking his virtue, he walks away in a glowing white suit.This is only a good argument, not a good film. If you're the kind of viewer who prefers that there's no work to do to find a films meaning or your own nobility (Do you like To Kill a Mockingbird?), this is for you. There's no meaning to find, because none of it is hidden. It's all important on the surface. There isn't movie I love that's this overt with its meaning. 12 Angry Men is a nobility machine. Viewers are fed through it, and come out the other end righteous.(* Grapes of Wrath, Ox-Bow Incident, To Kill a Mockingbird, Call Northside 777, all of Jodie Fosters issue films, all of Kevin Costners issue films, etc.)",5,15,32,3 March 2008
Hostel," Comme ci, comme ca
","Hostel is about three guys rambling around Europe. The plot is not that important. Within the hour people start being rendered into meat and meat by-products. This is pretty much in line with the preview which hinted at three horny guys looking for sex in Europe, and then getting drawn into a new level of R rated violence, which is exactly what occurs, without further nuance. The only thing the movie adds to the preview is more violence. It doesn't get deeper, more clever, or more interesting. This could have had the power of Bue Velvet or Last Tango in Paris, but it quickly gets run through the Hollywood formula which removes any trace of believability or interest. Instead it's pretty much a retread of Friday the 13th in which sexually-active teens are mutilated; the moralism that feeds the country.The characters are super bland. They have the most normative of sex. They 'make love' to some super-models. The movie is little more than hetero boy wish-fulfillment. You get to see some boobs on hot chicks and there's enough homophobia to reassure nervous viewers there's no possibility the movie will veer into any unexpected direction. You even get to hate Europeans. bonus. And gay people are back to being twisted psychotic sadistic freaks! double bonus. The guy gets to be heroic and save the chick (uh, well sort of).Gee what brave choices.",3,0,0,26 July 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," The bloating
","I was really surprised at how seriously awful this movie is. The early scenes are fine enough, and Lucy's entry into Narnia is nice. But ultimately 'Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe' seems to exist to transport audiences back to a time 30 years ago, when grotesque, over-produced, over-extended children's fare was the norm, because understanding children was a very low priority. Where to begin...? If your story culminates in a protracted, climactic war, you've made a war movie; this isn't exactly a genre kids are screaming for. That, and it takes the form of a long, lifeless sermon... another format that doesn't make children stampede to theaters. Every single moment of the movie is unengaging. The script sucks and lazy, hierarchical thinking insures that every moment has been scrutinized for maximum staleness; everything is done the way someone did it before. The film-makers find a sluggish way to mount every scene, and continually find ways to bring the movie to a complete standstill with characters spouting yet another boring pronouncement. It moves at the pace of a funeral dirge, and after maybe half an hour it has all the excitement of a diagram. Specificity vanishes to make room for more setpieces. Both Liam Neeson and Tilda Swinton give performances that some committee of drones approved. If your kid likes this, you've got yourselves a dud. Only pasty, anemic indoors-oriented Brit brats pining for a lordship could tolerate even twenty minutes of this. Sadly it's over two hours long. This movie is D.O.A..",2,3,6,20 July 2008
Coffee and Cigarettes," Aren't coffee and cigarettes stimulants?
","This movie is a feature length riff on a trifling idea that can't withstand it. I have no problem that Jarmusch works at the quiet end of the spectrum, and I welcome ambiguous alternatives to Hollywoods brainless output, but this derails pretty rapidly. Initially it feels like a Marx Bros. routine or an Ionesco theater of the absurd skit, but it never goes deeper, or makes a point. No matter how many vignettes of people meeting for coffee and cigarettes, and what order J.J. strung them together, Jarmusch just flashes a bunch of cool earmarks at the audience hoping they'll overlook that he has made an uninvolving and easily abandoned film - Simply being cute doesn't sustain a viewers interest. His script reaches a tiresome, suffocating pattern before ever drawing you in. Although the movie starts provocatively and recovers a bit by the end, the middle provides films most desperate definition of tedium and wasted celluloid. Remember Stranger than Paradise, and it's self-concious pauses? Jarmusch is still noodling with that idea, still attempting to make a cool product that urban hipsters will align themselves with. It's really pathetic that the deepest he will ever go is to continue playing to an audience whose coolness was defined by 1983! You could skip every movie he's made since then and jump right to this movie and there it is; Jarmusch's signature style sitting there unaffected and uncomplicated by a fresh development after 20 years.
Not since Book of Life have I seen such a tragic, posturing self-admiring blob of hipster excresence. Aren't you tired of hipsters? I have friends who still think Bauhaus are music's finest moment. They haven't grown since 1983 either. Life has moved on Jim.",Null,1,2,29 May 2004
Finding Nemo," a whole lot of blah
","After the over-the-top praise this movie received, I was surprised to find it to be an pretty unremarkable movie, and one that's not especially imaginative/visual. It is uncomplicated by any element not approved by committee, which means you get regurgitated under-sea relationships, with slightly modernized shtick. (Yep, there's a shark chase, but he's in recovery ?!) Take any three familiar mass market plot lines and average them together and you get something as tepid as this. This movie was gone from my mind the second it ended. I don't recall a frame of it.The only way you could be a fan of this movie is if you think a movie is supposed to spell everything out for you and cause you to emote every twenty minutes. It never touched me and it never engaged me. Nobody ever went broke tossing look-alike projects at undiscerning American audiences.",2,4,9,24 April 2004
Superbad," Funny but... (not a comedy milestone)
","It's been a summer of successful advance marketing campaigns for disappointing comedies. Superbad is certainly funny, but I had hoped for a movie that suggested or heralded the next era in comedy, as I had with the Simpsons movie. The P.R. machine hinted at something special. Instead it's just a comedy. The Simpsons Movie wasn't a comedy milestone & neither is this. It mixes humor with off-color language very well (Noone's gotten a hand-job wearing cargo-shorts since 'Nam!) But to deliver 'special' as it promised, the movie might need a less trivial plot, a shorter running time, a plot that went productive places, fewer cop scenes, a more daring pretext (other than just setting a record for F-bombs), and leads that are enjoyable to identify with. I'll forget Superbad in 2 months, in a way I'll never forget Rushmore, which WAS a comedy milestone and covered similar ground. The 'superbadness' of the title refers to the McLovin' storyline more than the other two lead characters, who have much more typical story arcs. Superbad tries to parlay Evan's 'first time' into a sentimental, not a 'superbad,' moment. Without a hook this storyline is the least interesting and forgettably conventional. Who cares if Evan wants to 'respect' Becca? This isn't a movie I came to see for a hackneyed message & she's a drip. He'll forget this dingbat a few minutes after he leaves for college. And he'll have to abandon his square ideas about females (or come out). Only closet-cases talk like this about girls in high school. That aside, Michael Cera, as Evan, continues to find ways to make bumbling, adolescent awkwardness funny & endearing. If you missed his role as George Michael in Arrested Development (He was amazing) this is your chance to see that technique. Not since Benjamin flopped at 'playing it cool' with Mrs. Robinson has someone been this good at being casually awkward. Dustin Hoffman was great but I think Cera is better. Really! He is unbelievably good at embodying high-school self-consciousness. You'll enjoy his performance of 'These Eyes' under duress in a room full of cokeheads.But I worry about where a young likable actor can go when he has so mastered a certain type of small character. I hope there are good roles in his future, but I bet Hollywood will either ignore him or require him to play this type of character 20 more times. They certainly won't know what to do with his atypical looks. A challenging role like Sandler in Punch Drunk Love, that requires him to be funny & shy but deliver depth, would be great. I hope we can see something like that.Less funny, but memorable is the movies conclusion which makes you recall how awful it was to say goodbye to your buddies.",6,2,15,18 August 2007
Alexander," Bewildered
","I'm trying not to pile on here. But this movie lost it's way so frequently that I was left with two questions. What was Stone hoping t achieve? and, Who on earth was the target audience? Stone just revived the antiquated swords-and-sandals epic formula and popped in some gay nuzzling. Structurally it's really a mess; it has flashbacks within flashbacks (Directors Cut) At various points I thought 'I'm really ready for this to become interesting.' But no it just soldiered on into obscurity.Two words: 'Blond Wig' Why on earth do you cast a dark brunette in the role of a golden blond god that then requires using awful wigs, and leaves Ferrell with thick black eyebrows? Ferrell may be hot but he's just not golden.",2,2,3,15 April 2008
Brokeback Mountain," It's nice enough
","The state of drama today is frustrating. The Academy has proscribed a certain tasteful treatment of topics, with high-production values and the thrust is always 'We should be more thoughtful and polite to (the hyper-intelligent, the sub-intelligent, the misunderstood criminal, the underdog, the outcast, gay cowboys).' Every recent drama can be inserted into that sentence. Even if I agree with those sentiments, it doesn't mean I want to sit through ensuing groups fed through the formula; or that I'm satisfied with that narrow recipe for drama. Life and people are deeper than that rubber-stamp allows. It's tiresome. Brokeback Mountain is the next entry in that contest. It's the kind of issue movie that the Academy loves.As far as drama goes BBM is at the rather simple end of the spectrum. The plot is as modest as this kind of movie event can bear. You've already imagined all the scenes that it could possibly cover before you go see it. It suffers from a few small problems; increasingly bad aging make-up and a peculiar stingy, puritanical need to move critical bits of drama offstage at odd moments (usually reserved for movies directed by Robert Redford). And a major flub in which a character dies and the the sub-text receives a confusing, inept visualization not in the main viewpoint of the movie. It had my crowd asking 'Who the hell's viewpoint was that?' I thought it would skimp on scenes where love grows from small bits of intimacy, but they're here and they're nice. What it does skimp on is the female characters who receive token coverage and have nothing to do.It's what the culture needs right now; an utterly safe polite movie about the topic. If it wins the academy award it's going to have the kind of shelf-life of something like Guess who's Coming to Dinner. A look back at it from the future will present a pleasant, mild curio that wasn't as important as it seemed.Dramatically it has some 'Oh Come on!' duds like Jack popping his wife in the butt. Mmmm. how literal. And the fact that Ennis doesn't even know the sightlines of his home that offer enough privacy to make out. I expected to dislike this movie but I didn't. Heath Ledger is quite good. It's a nice movie. It lacks a climax. But it's still in my head after two days.",7,3,19,27 February 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," grotesque
","After the end credits of POTC3 which last fifteen minutes, one's head is spinning. How could thousands of people who contributed to this idiotic movie believe it had anything going for it? The problem here is the problem of life: meaning. Virtually any movie that makes even a token stab at meaning is better than this, which doesn't even try. Each meaningless, arbitrary development arrives and is dispensed with without ever engaging a viewer. Your eyes are occupied by the shrill visuals, but none of it reaches your brain. About ten myth extensions show up the very second they're needed to get the characters to another special effects sequence, which is dependably more overdeveloped, tedious and moronic than the last. It's all pointless and loud. Ultimately the myth in the movie has no internal logic whatsoever. Because the plot arrives only as needed, up until the ending, a viewer has no hope of figuring out if the movie has two big sequences left or twelve. All this and a villain who's a total femmy wussbag.I lost interest in deciphering the stupid plot at about the 20 minute mark, and I was numb loooong before it ended. Any of Sparrow's charm or Depps talent from the 1st film is now completely squeezed off the screen. A whirlpool sequence goes on for twenty five minutes until any semblance of a threat has been neutered. That goes for every sequence. Here's how you can write POTC4: Add another rule to the myth, crank the volume & blow some sh*t up. The movie is also a study of bad skin.The duo who are supposed to be the comic relief are some sort of weak, corny writing I haven't seen since the 70s. It's family-oriented crap like you might see in Pete's Dragon.The first movie was a comedy, a pirate movie and a romance BUT became a blockbuster. The next two went straight for blockbuster, and just became crap. Noisy. Insipid. incoherent. shrill. exhausting. bloated. charmless. laughless. overproduced. overdeveloped; the same hideous qualities that we refused to watch in musicals from the 60s & 70s. How did we get to a place where we think this is entertaining instead of stupid and obnoxious? ...Oh that's right, Star Wars killed the 1970s film renaissance, and introduced thoughtles drivel as the norm.At World's End is every bit as terrible as Dead Man's Chest, which I walked out of at the 2 hour mark.The AMC theater chain owes me two hours of air conditioning after turning it off after the first hour. Find another way to cut costs and max profits, you jerks.",1,7,12,9 June 2007
Cloverfield," dumb, across the board
","This is the movie that technically talented but shallow people (people who think Star Wars is deep) would make. Even if you buy the premise, of all the people this event would affect in Manhattan, we have to spend the whole movie with dumb, inarticulate, shouting, self-absorbed 25 year olds (all of them white, natch), who couldn't think their way out of a dumpster. I guess all non-white people over 25 made it off Manhattan. You just get the feeling that these shallow dicks cannot wait to tell everyone it happened to them.The movie takes all of about twenty minutes to squander its potential. It starts with an interminable, dumb party scene whose entire purpose is to convince 25 year old viewers that the characters are cool enough (and the right age) to identify with. There is nothing of later importance that you need to take note of in the party scene. Then we're deposited in the poorly developed, intelligence-free creature half. The design of the creature is just a massive dud. Its semi-revelation comes way too soon, at which point it's such a lame concept that the only thing the movie can be is 'Biggest zoo animal ever, loose in the city.' If you don't have better ideas than that, just never show the damned creature. Just because your chosen format (video journal) doesn't allow the characters to fully understand the story, doesn't mean filmmakers can proceed without one so they can blow crap up. Why an undersea creature farts flaming bombs is just one of the juvenile resolution/conception problems (who knows?). Even if you read about the creature's back story, it makes no sense.I was trying to imagine which idiot would be the tastiest. And couldn't this thing eat them quicker? And then track down the writers? For this to receive accusations of originality is just sad. Everything in the movie is how Hollywood does it. It never feels real (which would have saved it) because characters continually do the same dumb, scripted things that Hollywood would have them do. Eminently fast-forwardable. This is a unusually dumb, very silly movie.",2,1,4,23 April 2008
Sleepy Hollow," Cheesy Hollow (Junk Commentary from Tim Burton)
","This movie is over-the-top cheese, and Depp plays an amusing sort of cowardly constable. Following Demi Moore's 'Scarlet Letter' school of text adaptation, this has zero to do with the Washington Irving story, but there you go. The movie's value is mostly visual.My previous low-water mark for commentary on a DVD is either Jodie Foster's obsession with talking only about what is real and what is fake in every shot of Contact, or of course the chronically stupid 'funny' commentary on Blood Simple, but this is right down there with them. It took me exactly six and half minutes to run out of patience with Tim Burtons inane, self-evident remarks. Between long stretches of silence he exhausts one adjective (amazing... Michael Gough is amazing, the cast is amazing, big Spanish horses are amazing...). Hey Tim, feel free to make some notes and watch it once before you you record your comments. But if he could do that, he'd be able to realize that nine out of ten of his movies have crappy scripts; Tim is quite inarticulate.I doubt anyone can top the immortal 4-word summary of this by LA Weekly's Manohla Dargis 'Sleepy and hollow indeed.' Too funny.",5,3,6,7 January 2005
Once," Guileless
","'Once' is a slight and charming film. And when it's over, the final scene captures a bittersweet tone I haven't seen since Local Hero. It closes a moment in these characters lives and sends these people away very respectfully, very nicely, which is completely in line with the rest of the movie. The pleasures were modest, and yet one misses the chance of further moments with such ordinary people instantly. Initially, as I watched, I was selecting places the conflict would come from and casting new faces as the villain... but this movie dispenses with villains, explosions, chases, false conflicts, false endings; underscoring what tired contrivances they are. It also dismisses iPods, style, attitude, bitchiness, conspicuous consumption... All of this crap proves to be extraneous. Reality sells itself. Human beings are back, front and center. How is it that Lars von Triers reductivist 'Dogme 95' rules, which should result in simple, direct movies like this, instead yield his last 5 pieces of phony, over-mannered, art-schlock.As soon as I was done I wanted to review certain scenes. The standard sincere contemporary Irish emo ballad (caterwauling) and the Irish tendency for rooms full of drunken people to break into awful songs, are not my cup of tea but it barely matters. The movie is very small and honest. Try pitching that to Hollywood.You: 'I'd like to make a nice, small, honest movie' Hollywood: 'That's not what we do'The supportive Irish family (There IS such a thing?), supportive friends, & strangers seem atypical to this Irish American. Where are the miserable, envious relatives undercutting your every move with crippling, defeatist remarks and guilt? (yuck yuck) I would love to see this movie win a boatload of Oscars to show Hollywood another, less grotesque, way to proceed. Unfortunately with the writers strike, the Oscars are likely to be canceled.",8,4,7,31 December 2007
Snatch," cocky
","Snatch was perceived by me and my buddies at the time as unapologetically male entertainment. We were all on board with a movie like this that was a template for male behavior we might snag. There's barely even a minor female role in it. As male attributes are largely performed, maybe the movie would show us how it's done. We wouldn't have admitted that at the time, but I'm more comfortable with that now. Guy Ritchie knows how to make a first movie that gets attention (and thus gets made), but one would have hoped he had better, more developed ideas about the 2nd; than to just duplicate the 1st movie; than troweling on style as anxiously and nervously as he does here, to disguise the fact that nothing's really going on. This movie's complexity doesn't reveal any more on ensuing viewings than it did on the 1st. It's complex for the sake of being complex. It's not really a film... it's just entertainment. Ritchie is obviously fond of these hoodlums in all their variety, and he makes us fond of them too; the self-assured, masculine Turkish, the vulnerable good guy Tommy. I loved watching Turkish and Tommy but their scenes don't add up to more than the sum of their parts, and that's the big problem with both of the movies (this and L.S. & B.) They're just a string of poorly-related conceits or 'features.'Pitt is fine here as an unintelligible thug. And Ritchie HAS come up with a pretty loathsome villain, not the easiest thing to do; a low-class, mean S.O.B. in an enormous pair of glasses. He can mark that down as an achievement. The movie is a strong reminder that there really are people you do not want to meet in this life, despite Hollywoods tendency to paint villains in generalities and broad strokes.The authors of Lucky Number Slevin (which you should see) obviously like this movie.",3,4,14,3 January 2008
Scary Movie 2," Atrocious.
","Stupid, loud, unamusing trash.The whole show here is vulgar language. I have no problem with vulgarity if the writing is skillful, but here it's mistaken as a direct substitution for wit. Every exchange here is a chance to swear or top the previous vulgarity, as if vulgarity itself is humor. Every place you can mention asses, penises and vaginas is considered a punchline. If you aren't twelve years old, you may not agree. It's just harsh and sophomoric. This formula wears out it's welcome in the first ten minutes. Each new bit is lousy and unfunny, and runs on and on without eliciting even a giggle: Chris Elliott with a withered hand, a foul-mouthed parrot, a Nike basketball spoof, a fist-fighting cat. What does any of this have to do with scary movies? It's so chronically off-track that you begin to wonder what the hell it is they're 'satirizing.'This is not how the first movie operated. Whoever directed this has no sense of humor, excess or pacing.No one will ever go broke making ever-more stupid movies for baked twenty-year-olds. This is a horrible movie made by the retarded, for the oxygen deprived.",1,6,13,7 August 2004
Alien," What do you get when you cross an alien with a snail?
","When I first saw this with a friend around 1983, we fired it up, and after a while she took a phone call and came back 20 minutes later, 'What did I miss?' she asked. '...nothing!' I responded. Truly, nothing had actually happened in 20 minutes.This is an unusually slow-moving movie. Contrary to arguments voiced here, movies were definitely paced faster than this at the time. (Except maybe Solaris and 2001) Yes, that's right, in 1983 we already thought this was slow. This is the movies major problem. It has only mood, production design, and a couple of scares. It's slow in the wrong parts and quick where it should be more developed. It takes 40 minutes to locate the distressed ship, which introduces the conflict, and 15 minutes near the end is devoted to the self-destruct sequence, and what's left over (the plot - killing everybody) is perfunctory and still dull somehow. 5 minutes for Harry Dean Stanton to look for a cat? A long self destruct sequence starts, an attempt is made to reverse it, then it goes ahead anyway. The reversal effort does nothing but increase the running time. Once on board the Sulaco, the alien spends a lot of time mugging from his perch in some pipes. It's destroyed about four seconds after it frees itself; a wasted opportunity. I just watched it again to see if I needed to reassess; there was no need. I completely honor it's achievement of changing sci-fi movies, but structurally it's bare. Characters are vaguely sketched in. Ad-libbed dialogue around the meal-table would have been a swell place to deepen the characters, not keep the language inaudible and trifling. It has no ideas. If you provide no ideas to think about, pacing is critical. Cameron was a better director for this type of thing as he proved with the superior sequel. This is reputed to be the first time blue collar workers are shown in space. Perhaps trying to look casual in space, Tom Skerrit is deliberately low-key and contributes to the films lethargy. Yaphett Koto receives the dumbest expository line in the script ('Ash is a ROBOT?') Yes, we're all about 3 minutes ahead of you there. Ridley Scott has an eye for detail, but he's just the wrong director for horror. It's just too arty to be scary. When Dallas gets it, there's a shock appearance of the alien who makes the 'Ta-daaaaa!' gesture with his hands which is unintentionally funny, not scary. There's enough bad direction like that to kill the mood. And a cat is a lame reason (& a lousy device) to continually leave your co-workers to die. On top of that the design for these DVD menus is very irritating. Gigers design for the majestic, evil alien is still astonishing.",5,12,27,4 March 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Humor is gone + Bonham Carter is horrible
","Let's get the bad out of the way first. This piece did not need to have it's grimness, bleakness or grotesque violence emphasized; and material this dark doesn't need dark film stock; that's unimaginative and literal. Leave it to Burton though (I'm not a fan) to strike the wrong & most obvious chord. This story is so dark that Sondheim provided much humor to lighten the piece. Burton is still too much in love with his production dioramas, and he mutes every glimmer of humor, because he's still more committed to being Goth than to finding a suitable expression for a unique project. I imagine he liked Sweeney Todd because he saw something he could squeeze through the same exhausted & shallow filters his previous work came out of. He took an epic sweeping tragi-comedy and found only a horror movie in it. How literal... How small.While one gets used to Johnny Depp's singing, Bonham Carter doesn't even register with her thin, dull, piping voice. Most of her lines are inexpressively sung and therefore her lyrics are utterly lost. Depp cold be playing opposite a mannequin for how little she brings to this. Nepotism handed her a star-making role, and she chose to sleepwalk through it. Any other female with a pulse and working facial muscles would have been a better choice. There has been talk of Deep getting an Oscar here; He does better than H.B.H., but just how nuanced is it to hold a scowl for an entire performance?Although some have praised this for how it's been opened up, the best filmic moments come early. There are just too many grey shots of Depp looking out the window. These characters need things to do. All Burton can muster over and over is to point them at each other while they're singing. That isn't enough, and it isn't direction. It still feels stagy & Burton's signature artifice can't relieve that. The final moment is the wrong tableau to end on. It's just too, too bleak. We should have had a few seconds of Antony reunited with Joanna.I'm amazed at how much they were able to keep from the play. They didn't muck it up too badly. The missing songs are forgiven. And I cried at least twice, from beautiful songs that Burton couldn't ruin no matter how 'adequate' or 'bland' his visuals; Sondheim is just that good. 'My Friends,' a love song sung to a razor, is still both powerful and chilling. 'Not While I'm Around' which somehow, miraculously didn't get cut is an absolutely beautiful moment. Ed Sanders who sings it blows Bonham Carter off the screen, because he can actually sing (There's an idea!) and as an actor he's able to realize the drama of that moment; meanwhile Bonham Carter seems to only be concerned that her lack of effort matches from scene to scene.Sondheims rousing orchestrations, despite changes, are as powerful as ever, and wonderful to hear on a movie theaters enhanced audio system. And his breathtaking musical structure (leit-motifs & revisited melodies) is largely intact. It reached me emotionally. I was crying as I drove home. But I just don't think that's the emotional terrain I had hoped a film Sweeney would cover. I'll be amazed if this material finds an audience.",6,10,22,21 December 2007
The Best Years of Our Lives," Dated of course, but touching
","I've been on a WW2 kick since seeing Band of Brothers. I didn't really enjoy From here to Eternity last night. I'm a cynic that loves It's a Wonderful Life, so getting me to soften up about The Best Years of our Lives was a tough-sell. But enough scenes accumulate that began to soften me. No one giving Dana Andrews a chance.... Myrna Loys candor in admitting how many times she's hated her husband. By the time Wilma helps Russell go to bed, I definitely shed a tear or two and I was very touched by the ending. Although Frederic March seemed like he'd turn out to be a hard-on, I even liked him by the end. Although his son just seems to evaporate at some point.

","Being an American entails watching people robotically tell themselves they like something that a marketing dept told them they like, and/or insisting there are laughs in the last few horrible Will Ferrell vehicles. The bits here are strenuously unfunny. The movie is a schlocky piece of garbage lifting garbage-y ideas from other garbage-y movies. This movie doesn't have an inch of redeeming celluloid. Every copy of it should be collected and dumped into some live volcano. Then we should all pity the volcano... Favreau made it for his adolescent daughter. It is over-ripe maudlin, sentiment that stinks worse than the dirty diaper you stepped in, in the Red Lobster parking lot last week.

Shutter Island," So Terrible... Why does Scorsese get a free ride for his weak films?
","From the opening seconds of this movie, it is dismaying to observe that a) this is clearly going to be the type of movie that hinges on a big twist, and that... b) Scorsese hasn't even been able to disguise that! It's clear in less than 2 minutes that Teddy Daniels (!) is an unreliable narrator; and Mark Ruffalo's character (who has precious little to do) is obviously only there to query Teddy and keep him talking, to relay his viewpoint as a narrative workaround; until the actual truth can be revealed at some arbitrary moment. I got news for you Marty; That is simply not interesting enough, and no amount of flashy technique will help. On top of that the story arc is indecipherable. We're asked to ingest very familiar 'startling' developments from the very start, and about every five minutes after that. So none of them seem terribly important.Scorsese is not assisted in this effort by a thoroughly mediocre Leonardo DiCaprio who can barely disguise his ambition to join the lineage of Scorsese's tough guys; no matter how much he doesn't fit the mold. DiCaprio can barely convince a viewer he's an adult, let alone a tough one. Not since Tobey Maguire appeared in 'The Good German' has an actor been this out of his depth. Given the pedigree of all involved, you'd think someone would have figured out this stinker had no potential. There is no merit to be found in this pre-digested, overproduced dud. There is nothing to sustain this irrelevant trip through the machinery again. Sometimes in the pursuit of thrills and and innovative imagery in an effort to be interesting, it's a good idea to just stop what you're doing and be interesting.",2,2,8,24 February 2011
Lost in Translation," Laconic
","There's a nice film in here trying to get out, which is probably what all the kudos and awards acknowledge. The other nay votes do have a point: this movie shows one too many scenes of cultural isolation / modern ambivalence. On the other hand it's just like life in it's lack of overall momentum and it's quieter moments. It's really free from Hollywoods dirty fingerprints, which makes it remarkable for a second film. The score and the sentiments are gentle, which is why a young audience can't make heads or tails of it. Gentleness has no place in American culture anymore: It couldn't be sold to anyone for a profit.There are too few films made about friendship. Unfortunately while Scarlett Johanssen looks lovely and Bill Murray is a national treasure, this movie stays in the average pile. The movie seems chronically underwritten. The script says something about being adrift in various ways. It just doesn't say it very rapidly.I used to think that people like Murray used humor to bring people closer, but now I realize it's way of keeping people at bay by never letting them see even a hint of who he really is. I begin to wonder if this is Murray's problem, an observation he brougt to the character or both. It would be nice to see him actually relate to someone instead of to exist outside of the moment mocking it. His humor is a pretty effective force field.",5,1,2,22 April 2004
Barry Lyndon," Completely avoids the obligation to entertain
","A slow movie isn't necessarily a bad movie. Often when viewing a slow movie, it's still possible to detect and enjoy a director's intent. In outwardly dull movies such as Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Conversation,' Kubrick's own '2001,' and 'Being There,' the movies are actually teeming with subtext, and exciting ideas which afford a view of what the director intended to explore. I cannot find any such quality in Barry Lyndon. I am unable to even guess why Kubrick wanted to make this. It's difficult to see what excited him about the project. How does the social rebellion of 'A Clockwork Orange' and '2001' dissipate into this constipated movie by 1975? Kubrick foregoes both entertainment and camera movement to a Puritanical extent here. The movie is also homophobic. It's filled with sophomoric tableaux lifted from Hogarth's 'A Rakes Progress,' which still don't answer the question, 'What's the point?' If I don't care about the obvious level of a movie, I don't feel any compulsion to look for symbolic or thematic value. Most of the establishing shots in this movie are beautiful, as are some settings which are photographed like paintings. It's just not enough.",2,19,50,27 March 2008
The Grapes of Wrath," profoundly unsubtle
","This is a social conscience picture form the genres heyday. Although never described as such, the dust bowl was an American refugee crisis. Wrath follows some of the affected characters who are so poor they probably owe rent on their own skin. From the very first frame Gregg Tolands photography is amazing, whether it's simply a static composition or whether the camera is in motion.John Ford, as Orson Welles has said, was an artist, but he's not particularly known for getting anything more than serviceable performances out of his corral. And usually any of the finer points of a performances are held a beat too long, or are notched up well past what is necessary, as are movies of the period.But the real crime here is that the film's 'nobility of the common man' pap is piled upon itself so high that a viewer begins to suffocate. A little of that goes a very, very very long way. I was shouting at my TV - 'Oh please, will you move on. We got your thesis! Everyone GETS IT!' He also does this in They were Expendable. He does it in 'How Green was my Valley.' He doesn't do it in 'The Quiet Man,' which is a movie I like. In this world poverty is the signifier of moral righteousness. Grampa Joad gumming his way through addled, irritating, overacted speeches, and Pa Joad going for a bath with his junk flapping around are thrills I'd prefer to miss.As is the tradition in Amercan films, if a man over 70 gets in a car for a long trip he ain't going to make it. As was his style, Max Steiner selects a musical motif and beats you to a pulp with it. Here it's Red River Valley. The crew ends up at a Utopian work camp as unreal as the epilogue in Raising Arizona. But the conflict is still pretty accurate about how conservative reactionaries generate phony causes to dismantle any peaceful, progressive threat to their viability. And it only hints at what complete thugs conservatives will become.",5,4,10,31 January 2008
Corpse Bride," stiff
","Burton cranks up the machine again to poop out this formulaic product ...and there it sits. It cost me nada to watch and I still couldn't bear more than about half an hour. Developments are non-existent (The sole plot point is the title). There needed to be some attitude to the material, a concept...there is none. The tone is forthright. Characters just stand around, repeatedly explaining how very little is going on; stretching things thinner and thinner, until you're looking at 100 percent concentrated boredom. Danny Elfman's songs are half-hearted musicalizations of the lackluster narrative points.Most of Burton's favorite visuals get recycled again. He clearly stopped thinking after he penned a gag for each scene, throughout the whole movie. That's just not good enough. His first idea is almost always cribbed from somewhere else, and has been weakened over a century to the point of cliché, by the time he finds it and shouts 'Eureeka!' in complete obliviousness. Burton should sit down with a textbook that explains how narratives work, before he ever touches a camera again.",1,7,17,23 July 2009
The Bourne Ultimatum," parallels
","When we Americans need a break from the depressing news from our inept violent actions around the world, we go to the movies and see six previews for new violent movies, before we settle in for a violent feature like The Bourne Ultimatum. Ahhh, nothing like a little light entertainment. Gee. I don't understand why we're misunderstood in the world.The movie, its action sequences & its music are certainly well beyond anything in the tired James Bond series, but the backstory here turns out to be flimsy & ridiculously insufficient to have put the violence & actions of the 3 movies into play. We find out who Jason Bourne is in a scene so underwritten that one has to guess that his original motives were well-intentioned. Or as I was thinking; 'Poor dumb thing... How could you be so naive?' The movie would be better without this scene.And it's here the movie unintentionally parallels the real world and makes the same painful point we're relearning in Iraq; the efforts and intentions of the young and patriotic can be warped & misused for sick, corrupt, personal & political reasons; until say, a stupid backwoods girl is holding the leash of a naked prisoner and going to jail as a scapegoat. At the start of the war, naive people were warned that they were being used, but they didn't listen and lambasted people's patriotism. Now the same people tell me it's my duty to 'support the troops.' Well I'm more knowledgeable than you; I don't let myself be used by corrupt politicians. It isn't the nations job to make you feel better about the ill-conceived decisions you make, which help ruin the reputation of OUR country abroad. I am disgusted by the deaths and injuries the young are withstanding after willingly placing themselves into this war. They have my deep sympathy, but some lessons come at a high price.For Jason Bourne, it's a dead girlfriend (Film 2 in the series) and a lost memory. I enjoyed the movie but how can people question so little, before offering their services as a killer?

The Aviator," Tucker; the man and his car / Part 2
","Many moviegoers bemoan Woody Allen's work of the last 15 years as being a shadow of his former self. But late Scorsese work is not a pretty thing either. Gangs of New York was a self-impressed bouquet of flowers to the dimmest of male viewers. Age of Innocence was glacial and uneventful. Shutter Island was Scorsese's limp contribution to the twist-ending genre. Aviator (like GoNY) proves that Scorsese continues to take interesting story ideas (here, the rise and fall of oddball Howard Hughes) and turn them into flat, superficial projects. The movie has a script that might've been written by-a-machine. The author is working in shallow mode. The excessive winks at the audience are tiresome. (Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow, Rufus Wainwright as a big band singer) DiCaprio is again amateurish and wrong for the role. He cannot play a character of any complexity; also miscast are both Blanchet as Hepburn, and someone else (?) as Ava Gardner. Another character mispronounces the name of Theda Bara because she's just some nobody mired the past. Blanchet looks like the only cast member who appears to be older than 19. And the acting is straight out of a high school play. Inexplicably, this won an Oscar for it's exceptionally cheap-looking cinematography. There is nothing to discover in this movie, because nothing is hidden. Scorsese is at least as shallow as Michael Bay. His early work won kudos for being forthright, but ideas just don't adhere to his films.",2,2,7,6 March 2011
Léon: The Professional," Many Deviates like this Movie
","The Professional is an awful movie. Natalie Portman is precocious and godawful. The premise is absurd without knowing it is, or being entertaining. It has no internal logic. The scene in which Portman tries on outfits & performs is excruciating for anyone who is not a child molester. Films that engage adolescent girls (who spend their adolescence being as grating and needy as Portman is here) are rare in Hollywood. The equal to Portmans work here is the excruciating character of Penny in the Lost in Space remake. Gary Oldhams performance is this achieves a new height; the height of idiocy.But the movie has much, much more wrong with it; namely the eroticization of a 12 year-old girl, in the movie and in the public reaction. This is deeply disturbing. An entire cult of straight weirdo's has sprung up who talk very heatedly about Portman in this movie. They consider her a nymphet like Lolita. They brag about in the uncut European edition in which Leon (reportedly) has sex with Mathilda.Hey freaks, if you think this movie is hot, you're a sociopath.Portman has turned into a striking young woman who unfortunately dependably continues to select and make more bad movies.",Null,4,11,8 March 2006
Burn After Reading," Powerfully lousy movie-making
","This is the crappy movie the Coens have always hinted they have in them, and now this dreary, leaden, pointless dud is in the evidence archive for keeps. It's the best argument for why the Coens should never, ever stray from their formula again. 'Burn After Reading' is the kind of Mannerist, misguided movie you make just to keep working, rather than because you have a decent idea. Structurally it's incompetent. Characters and motivations are introduced (in maybe ten minutes) and then we're in a holding pattern for the rest of the movie. Nothing develops. All of the characters proceed to behave like thinly written morons from the 'American Pie' movies. Scene after scene just sits there, piling up, one after another, defying the urge to entertain, building to nothing. There isn't a confident move made in the whole thing.The cast all has a 'Hooray, I won the lottery... I'm in the next Coen Bros movie!!' look on their faces. But the firepower just ends up being too heavy for this piddling idea (And when I call it an 'idea,' I'm being very gracious). You've never seen so many big names with so little to do. Despite all the super-positive energy on display, no one can convert this turd into something else. And no one is as lost as Brad Pitt, who tries to shoehorn a leading man effort into his small, dumb supporting part.This is a comedy? Can the Coens tell a joke without over-explaining it like a pair of nerds? It was so very, very easy to tune this movie out and think about my utility bills, consider where I should go on my next vacation, compile a list of chores I needed to do, etc.. Just a terrible, terrible movie. Water-thin.",1,9,20,26 December 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Dork World - Yap Yap Yap...
","Does the prospect of watching elves, warriors and wizards talk and talk and talk, interrupted by seven or eight nearly identical battle/peril sequences appeal to you? If you liked Willow, Legend, Dune, Spawn, Gladiator this is pretty much the same thing. If you liked Star Wars (which singlehandedly ruined movies) you'll like this garbagy sermon. George Lucas stole most of his Star Wars story from this. This movie has the same things wrong with it that all costly blockbusters do. They're too expensive to risk being original so you get a lot of scenes that barely mask their origins in previous blockbusters. You get thrill-ride special effects sequences (that aren't very thrilling) in place of any really engaging ideas. Characters yammer with faux-profundity for 3 hours. A script like this is for people who resent having to find meaning themselves and just want the characters to tell them what a movie means. Then they can declare it 'high-art' because of it's pseudo-poetic pretensions (Spawn, Final Fantasy) and it's Wagnerian pretensions. I guess that makes paintings of English cottages with thatched rooves (you can buy at a starving artists sale) masterpieces too. You'd have to be under five to miss any of the supposed 'allegorical' meaning here.I doubt you'll remember a single line from it after you leave. It lacks subtlety, a unifying idea, a volume-knob, anything entertaining or challenging etc. This is a tedious by-the-books filmed book. An overwrought score (ripped off again from Karl Orff's Carmina Burana) attempts to make you feel emotions that the script has neglected. A huge percentage of webkid/Tolkein fans saw it the first two days and have front-loaded positive reviews acros the web. Hopefully the second wave of opinions will push the title off of top ten lists where it does not belong. It might be the number one lifless filmed book of all time, but it ain't a film. This is not the worst movie ever made but it is utterly mediocre with lazy scripting & visualization; a catalog of the ever-lowering standards that became accepatable in movies over the last decade of the twentieth century. There is little that's unique or memorable in this movie. The chases in this movie look exactly like what chases have looked like in films for seventy years.There are plenty of early warning signs that it's a lemon: Narration that obfuscates and embroiders before you even get your bearings (remember Dune?). Leaden lines of expository dialogue tell you things instead of showing them to you. Every fifteen minutes someone spouts 'We're nearing the (blank) of (blank) i.e, the Pit of Shimmwatz, the Caves of Killjoy, the Chasm of Infinite Boredom, etc... The names are unintelligible and the effect is comical. It's just an arbitrary sequence of events that occur along the path to a goal, which is never even reached ( ! ). It has no dramatic arc.Whether this journey went on for 90 minutes or 3 hours makes no difference to fans because the generation that thinks Star Wars is a good movie doesn't realize that SW chucked pacing, character development or even building a story. Hopefully digital epics will wear out their welcome much the same way the pre-digital epics from the fifties and sixties did. It's not good that actors are capable of reading a script like this and thinking it's good, but it's worse that pre-hyped audience is waiting to call it a masterpiece. This movie is junk. It's really depressing that people could mistake this for even an adequate movie.Tolkein fans are gushing over it because they bring feelings (established while reading the book) with them and project them onto the movie. But you get the sense that these people would think a film about three people sitting around talking about hobbits would be a masterpiece too. If you're interested in a movie and it's a little pretentious, anything you like is a masterpiece. But, whether a director has reverentially embalmed a book is not decent criteria for declaring a film a masterpiece. The geeks who are saying so have no higher goal for a movie than that it be made from a book they love. The 'kewl' visuals resembling the understimulating CD-ROM game Myst are a plus. The fans are spastic to get online to tell you that it's a masterpiece AND that it doesn't match the way they visualized it. Hey guess what, that's not any decent films job!The final scene of the movie in which two hobbits confirm that they are great friends as they move off to address the threat the movie has been plodding towards for 3 hours, is absurd. This isn't the kind of story where the friendship of 2 hobbits means anything conclusive; Getting to THE POINT would have been swell.Bring a cast iron butt and an alarm clock with you. Watching it is a feat of endurance.",1,4,16,21 December 2001
The Caine Mutiny," about as complex as a doodle
","In order to provide Bogart with Oscar attempts at the end of his career he jumped to supposedly complex roles, which were often just 2-dimensional heels. Bogart was a professional but it was his bad fortune to require these roles in the '50s, a very poor time for drama; the doldrums between noir and the French new wave. There probably is a great drama to be generated from a supposed U.S. mutiny. It very well might star Humphrey Bogart as a character like Captain Queeg. If this had been made in the forties it would have had a chance, but by the fifties dramatic efforts had become regressive and shallow, mired in spectacle and production merits as a tool to wedge people away from their sofas and TVs.The 2nd half devolves into the standard dumb courtroom sequence, a format beloved by crappy writers for it's ability to infuse some cheap drama into a movie. Will there be surprise testimony? an outburst? Will a jerky witness shoot himself in the foot? ...can you name a single movie with a courtroom scene where two of those three things don't occur? Robert Francis plays the wholly unnecessary part of a whitebread, dull as-a-post Momma's boy who finds it easier to mutiny than he does to put his mother in her place. Oy vey! He also kills time in a conventional love story that has no reason to be here. The sub-plot might as well have aliens in it, for how little any of it matters. The signature characterization of Queeg as an insecure guy who nervously plays with some steel balls at moments of vulnerability is as thin as paper. Van Johnson is the only actor here who's asked to show any range. The largest of the movies sins after its hokey dramatic arc is the infuriating over-scoring of the movie. Max Steiner, never a very imaginative composer, takes two motifs; an original theme, and From the Halls of Montezuma, and blares them endlessly to convey two points: 'The plot is thickening' and 'Although we all hate Captain Queeg, we're still pro-military!' Mmmmm, won't you please, please, please pound me over the head with one of these two stupid music selections again? This is the last time I can watch an over-scored movie from between 1930 and 1960. I really cannot bear anymore of this unsubtlety after Grapes of Wrath, Moby Dick, The Heiress, etc.This movie is about as complex as a game of tic-tac-toe, and perhaps about as compelling. If you want to see Bogart play a heel, just rent Treasure of the Sierra Madre. I'm with Dave Kehr who wrote, 'Dymytrk's ham-fisted direction does little to alleviate the obviousness of the drama and the thinness of the characterizations' But I can sum those points up even quicker, 'Pffff-f-f-f-ffft!'",1,11,26,2 February 2008
28 Weeks Later," zombie mombie
","Well, here we are again. The zombies are back after being quelled. It would have been terrific is the writers devised a clever way to revive the extinguished plague. Instead the absurd plot posits that two bratty idiot kids bring about the 2nd zombie outbreak; that their half-zombie mom is the vessel; and that their dad (her husband) who happens to be the guy running the safe zone is the first full-on zombie, with an alpha security clearance. It's nice that they could keep the entire plot in the family. It's like Dickens' lost zombie novel where everyone (again...) turns out to be related.Rarely has the solution to a zombie invasion been this simple; target and kill this whole stupid family in the first few minutes of the movie; the stupid kids, the stupid father, even loving mom. That should do it. God how I came to hate this family. At one point the boy brat asks, 'Do you think Mom is alive?' when he might better ask 'Do you think our genetically-inherited stupidity caused all of this?' Why have the people in zombie movies never heard of zombies? Why don't characters who freak out when a person appears and disappears over an edit, have the knowledge I do from ghost movies? Why do characters spend half a horror movie not acknowledging what they've seen? Why does the world of knowledge acquired from film not exist for characters in films? This idea would save audiences a lot of annoyance and crap movies. I guess it's only fair that it doesn't start well because it also has no ending. It's nice to see London go up in flames though.",1,43,70,23 November 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," Insipid
","Wow. I'm stunned.Every once in a while a movie comes along that is jaw-droppingly horrible to the point that it leaves your mouth hanging open. I lack sufficient terms to express how trite and repellent I find this simpering movie. It's an exhausted 'human spirit' movie so cloying that it needs to be taken off life support. From the first time I saw the TV commercial which featured the hackneyed ruse of getting the whole family in one vehicle for the duration of a movie, I suspected the script would have difficulty making that premise believable. It certainly fails there, but that's the least of its problems. But still, the wealth of good reviews drew me to buy a ticket. My initial reservations were right. This script is an inept piece of garbage long before you evaluate it on moral grounds, where it collapses spectacularly.The family here is a mix of characters so drippy and dense that they never realize their dumpy, uncoordinated, bespectacled daughter isn't the Junior Miss type. It takes them exactly one pageant (following a needless cross country trip) to figure that out. The same family doesn't realize that a heroin-snorting, horndog grandfather shouldn't be the one teaching their adolescent daughter her beauty pageant dance number. Why not go all the way and include a 'funny scene' of grampa molesting her? The setup is practically there; a scene so distasteful feels like it's just off-screen (or on the cutting room floor) in this wholly objectionable movie.Long after a ridiculously unbelievable 'chance meeting' in a gas station, long after paper-deep villains have been thrown at the screen, long after the annoying Murphy's Law plot line is exhausted, comes the most sick, saccharine, crappy moment in all of film history which involves a family attempting to redeem their seven-year old daughters failed, inappropriate talent routine (a strip tease) by joining her on stage. Sexualizing a seven year old girl without her being developmentally able to understand it... mmm, that's comedy gold. This 'edgy material' is about as palatable as a cup of bleach.I'm not one to look for messages but here we've got something like 'Let's all support each other as we swim up the cr*p river of life!'I'm sure it's supporters think I've missed the point and that the humor is just dark. It's not dark. Making a dark comedy is an art. This comedy has no edge in it's delivery. It's filmed straight. It's acted and presented ineptly. It's about as edgy as a smutty episode of Seventh Heaven. This is the rotten family-values homily to end them all. Drawing big saccharine payoffs to support a family values theme also places this squarely in mainstream whitebread entertainment.It makes perfect sense that idiotic Hollywood would nominate this tripe for a bunch of Oscars, but I can't believe I respect people who like this atrocity. The Oscars have become so gratingly self-impressed, and the nominees so limp, that all you can really do anymore is root against films you don't want to have any further influence on the culture. I am so glad it lost the Best Picture award last night; Today it starts a long descent to the bottom of time's toilet, exactly where it belongs, where it will be forgotten.",1,67,124,22 January 2007
Doctor Zhivago," David Lean phones it in
","Dr. Zhivago concerns a bright, privileged figure who should've risen to the ranks of the Russian cognoscenti, but the decades-long revolution consumes the entirety of his life. This long story tracks the random, glancing interactions of 4 or 5 major players. But those moments deliver little of the frisson they might. Director David Lean is on autopilot, and assumes viewers are interested. But the movie has very little forward momentum and is about as involving as a chart. It never develops a center. And there's no getting around the fact that Omar Sharif is miscast. Even he was surprised when Lean offered him the title role. (He was seeking a smaller part) Sharif hits his marks and no more. He has no presence or weight; and he makes you wonder why a very long book was written about this vague, empty character. Additionally, a British-inflected middle-Easterner is lost in the middle of all this. Rita Tushingham, was apparently cast for her ability to bulge her eyes ambiguously for hours on end. Megahit 'Somewhere, my Love' is intoned continually despite the fact that it undermines things.",2,13,28,30 January 2011
The Shining," Book, schnook
","Many King fans hate this because it departed from the book, but film is a different medium and books should change when they make the jump. That notwithstanding, the movie does fail completely, but it fails entirely on film terms. I'd like to smack the people who tell me it's the scariest movie ever made. I always follow up with the question 'Really... exactly what scene scared you?' Every fan I've asked, goes silent. Occasionally someone, at a loss for a decent scare (There are none...), names the 'Grape-juice-shooting-out-of-elevators' shtick. If you're afraid of that, I don't know what to tell you, except maybe that you're easily scared. I just rolled my eyes watching these z-grade horror ideas play out in this schlocky, incoherent movie.One place it diverts from the book and really is insipid is the tedious work the movie does to get Mr Halloran up to the Overlook only to kill him; with the dumbest member of the audience knowing that Jack is waiting behind one of the columns in the corridor that it takes Halloran FOREVER to walk down. Really one of the stupidest sequences ever put on film. Oh, and nice choice for Mr. Halloran's artwork Stanley! Black light afro-nymphomaniacs really add to the mood and character development of a horror movie. Has there ever been a more 'off,' out-of-place shot in any movie ever made?I consider it a miracle that I was eventually able to bypass this turd, and agree that Kubricks 2001 is a truly important film, given the immense 'bad will' generated by both this stupid, stupid movie, and the cult of fawning but inarticulate Kubrick fan-boys, who couldn't describe an idea at work in it with every film resource in the Library of Congress in front of them. Toss in the grotesque overacting of Jack Nicholson, the introduction of dumb one-liners at tense moments, and the Razzie nominated performance of Shelly Duvall and you have a very crappy movie.",1,17,38,21 December 2007
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Here's what it looks like when a movie dies on screen
","I laughed once or twice when I saw the first ten mins of this, then had an obligation to attend to. Never saw the rest. But I picked it up on clearance last night for just a buck (!), and I can only say; even a dollar, was waaaaaaay too much to pay for this turd.The entire 'Watch how funny we make this next extremely unfunny scene!' thing is way dead. Every single gag feels like it was written down once and never improved; in the hope that the now-thoroughly irritating combo of the Apatow Barn of blunderers, and SNL 2nd raters would really push it over the top. They don't. This is lifeless. It's a movie where comedy goes to die. As with all Sandler, Carrey, Apatow movies, the half-written humor is blended with conventional, sentimental touchpoints that don't belong anywhere near a comedy movie. (I thought we were mocking that.)",1,9,20,17 December 2011
Van Helsing," a seriously dopey movie
","Taking a very, very dumb page from Sleepy Hollow (in which a famous textual schoolteacher was somehow changed into a cop), van Helsing the occasional vampire killer is now the full-time enforcement arm of the living against all things dead and evil, James Bond c.1889 if you will... If you stir in some of the moribund over-dramatics of Interview with a Vampire you get this frantic, loud, stupid movie.Things are off to bad start with two unnecessary introductory sequences which eat up twenty minutes at the beginning that serve no purpose except to confirm for viewers that, yes this is the dumb fx movie you have been waiting for. The second of the two involves an absurd Shrek-like Mr Hyde. whom would scarcely fit into Edwardian London as a ten foot tall giant with acromegaly. If a sequel is made, presumably van Helsing will kill a nine-foot tall Lizzie Borden or Jack the Ripper with 4 arms.The plot is one long bad joke. The beautiful princess Dexatrim (Kate Beckinsale) gets her brother killed and mayhem follows with all the Universal monsters except the Mummy. The euro-trash Dracula is grating and unsexy in everyway. He looks like a slightly uglier, more feminine k.d. Lang and unless you're a goth-nerd, his ponytail is about fifteen years late to offer even an ounce of hipness. The Frankenstein monster is excruciating. It's like he reimagined as a nerd/accountant. The 'romance-novel' grade script requires that all the men have long hair. This is best suited for sugar-impelled viewers for whom the current scene needs to be an overstimulating distraction because the last twenty weren't enough.The last time this extravaganza was filmed it was called Hudson Hawk. This time it's more excessive. It's too long, too boring, too annoying, way too stupid and simply not enough fun. I know it's just escapism, but I have no need for any movie that makes my brain hurt as much as this.Note: This decades film-work is being marred (and will be recalled historically as marred) by the tendency of fx film directors to ruin movies by shooting even simple no-fx-required shots with green-screen, because it's cheaper, easier, and they're lazy. Another film revolution will occur when Hollywood realizes when filming a simple shot of a guy with a torch in a field looks really amazing when you just shoot the damn guy in a field.If you want to smirk while watching a piece of silly, campy crap, rent the grade-Z movie Frankenstein Unbound. 'Camp' is when you have ten thousand bucks to make a movie and you let the movie have some fun by acknowleging that. It isn't spending millions on a loud, stupid movie because you lack taste. This movie is an exhausting drag.",1,1,3,10 March 2005
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," already dated
","A friend had just watched this and was reliving their favorite scenes a few days ago. I recall liking the movie but my response was continually, 'I don't remember that scene... I don't remember that... or that...' I had vague positive feelings about it, but had forgotten the entire movie except the waxing sequence, and the 'You know how I know you're gay' banter. Watching it tonight, I was really stunned at what a loose, aimless string of shock/humor/provocation it is. Like 'There's Something about Mary,' most of it's value was in seeing it the first week or two, in a packed theater, to laugh your ass off over things that were startling to see on the screen. There are laughs in it, but your interest is frequently lost in obviously extemporaneous dialog, and lots of padding.Apatows comic style is the one-joke movie, and usually the joke is invoked by the title as in this and Knocked Up. His comedy doesn't revolve around plot, but language and observed behavior instead. There's nothing wrong with that and I'll be forever grateful to him for sparing us from asinine idea-comedies like 'Click' with Adam Sandler. But in all his movies, the characters just kind of go through the motions once the premise is introduced. We all drank the Apatow Kool-aid but the moment is quickly passing. I'll be amazed if he has more than a year or two left in him. Maybe if he learns to recognize/produce a finished script.Because Apatow mixes more sentimental urges with raunchy humor, people give him a pass, but all his movies include some really sappy crap. Steve Carell's magic tricks, action figures & the final musical number all make my butt tighten. At this point we still knew so little about Carell that we gave him the benefit of the doubt paying such a dork, because the movie was so edgy. But when you go on to make Evan Almighty in an effort to pander to the lowbrow, bottom-feeding religious dollar, you actually are a dork.",5,1,3,28 December 2007

True enough but that goes double for the conflict, the villain and the resolution of each new calamity, which are as predictable and shallow as video games.Within a year of watching people fall to their deaths from a collapsing World Trade Center, we're entertained by a movie which features Kirsten Dunst about to fall to her death from a damaged skyscraper. That's entertainment? No that's bad taste. You'd have to go back to Murder on the Orient Express and watch author Agatha Christie recycle the Lindbergh kidnapping to sell books after too short a passage of time, to see anything more cynical.Instead the correct means of channeling fear and unresolved feelings over 9/11 is to pester two kids who scared the dumber members of the culture with light-brights, featuring the Mooninintes.

Ratatouille," Starts O.K.
","...but goes to pieces.I appreciate that this was about a goal other than falling in love. The choice of a plot that introduces kids to a passion for food is fresh. The final development which portrays food as a gesture that invokes love & memory is very nice. The critics change of heart is poignant like the Grinch's. Storywise, I can't accommodate why Linguini, who can't wait for a moment to monkey with the boiling soup, has to know absolutely nothing about cooking for the whole film. The two ideas are incompatible. The fraud storyline is not engaging. The movie is about twice as long as I'd prefer, due to dual protags whose stories need to receive development & resolution, but the usual psychodrama of earning a parents respect (Remy / rat) and believing in oneself (Linguini / human) must be a tiresome saw for kids, and adults have seen it a thousand times. The climax in which a swarm of rats gets the run of the kitchen of a French restaurant is over the top (and frankly kinda gross). All of this goes down while revisiting two of Disneys most exhausted, irritating mainstays; A) protagonists regardless of race/nationality will appear to be Caucasian Americans, and B) villains will always be foreign & physically extreme. Adding insult to injury is that there is a token black character in the kitchen who doesn't have a single line of dialog.I'm not a big fan of Pixar's run of successful movies. Only Monsters Inc. did anything for me. I disliked Nemo in the extreme, and you couldn't lure me to go see Cars with a thousand dollar bill on fishing line.

Aliens," The good kind of escapism
","I've been a fan of this movie for over 20 years now. It's hard to believe the years have passed so quickly since it made the cover of Time magazine! 'Aliens' owes everything to 1) a wonder of a script that gives even those in small roles, who may only have a handful of lines, a pretty defined character. Structurally it's very intelligent, and every single new character in the large cast is memorable. 2) Syd Meads impressive gadgets 3) Sigourney Weaver! who knows enough to be fierce AND scared, and is given sequences where she can actually save some of this crew. Which is not to say that other elements aren't also impressive (score, camera work, fx, editing and... it goes without saying, direction). You never doubt this world exists for a moment. It's so convincing and alive. All that, while being true to the first movie, while freeing itself up in amazing ways. Every choice is smart and produces a better movie than the usual cop-outs one finds in a sequel. All this and the only role Bill Paxton has ever been good in.In 1986 this movie delivered shock after shock in scenes that have since become boilerplate. It's a catalog of continually hopeless scenarios dropping while Ripley soldiers on: Your sole means of getting off a planet has just crashed in front of you? Keep a tough disposition, be a hard-ass and work it through. She wipes the floor with the Marine troop she's supposed to be depending on. The movie has more than rewarded your interest before the very cool climactic brawl plays out. I see about three movies a decade that don't blow their final act. Weaver is so awesome as Ripley that it's hard to believe that once she owned the franchise, she made such dependably rotten decisions. Cameron drunk on kudos went on to write the simpering, facile script for Titanic, which means his writing and evaluative skills are not as honed as Aliens would suggest. If you haven't seen this yet, what are you waiting for?(I always found it amusing that planets and spaceships helpfully count down their own destruction)",8,14,22,16 February 2008
No Country for Old Men," Better work (finally) from the Coens
","I'm an enormous fan of Blood Simple and not much else from the Coens. I consider The Big Lebowski, and The Ladykillers two of the dumbest films ever made. This movie is much better than the Coen's last 8 genre ripoffs. Its structure is very forthright; it's a pleasure to watch the Coens make plot points and connections with something other than dialog; you have to pay attention (but really not even that much) to understand/anticipate the motivation of the next scene. Even respected directors (Scorcese) have become dependent on actors explaining things to make plot points; and been filming talky scripts with little invention. It's just better when it's done in a filmic manner. The wordless connections here reminded me of the silent sequences where plot develops in Antonioni's Blowup.The real problem with the movie begins about the time Jones who has been an internalized man of few words for the whole movie, meets up with his brother and suddenly becomes effusive. Everything that was underplayed, or in the subtext, becomes hideously direct and clumsy. Jones had already been heading for a best actor nom, but the Coens apparently wanted to give him a hammy scene or two to pump the Oscar-consideration process, in the media hype that leads up to that free-for-all. These scenes are leaden.It's generally very economical. All the questions I wondered about were answered with a little thought except one; How the hell do Jones and Bardem not encounter each other in the hotel room? Also the title is so dumb it almost prevented me from seeing it; telegraphing the theme, the ending, the final score, etc. I can imagine about a thousand better titles. And changing it from the book may have grated them the freedom to scrap some bookish scenes. You could toss everything away that occurs after Bardem exits the family household and looks at his boots. In these places it begins to look like their meandering, pointless Man who Wasn't There. It has about 4 endings too many.I've recently revised this review downward after a suitable amount of time has passed. I am utterly neutral (no interest) about seeing this movie a 2nd time, so it failed there for me. It also doesn't make me contemplate a thing, not even film technique.",3,5,11,20 November 2007

That's at least as flimsy and poorly explained as anything in the Schumacher dreck. He wants to avenge his parents death? Well his parents were shot by a two-bit thug. Not by the mob, or some convoluted conspiracy. You don't need to travel to Asia to learn martial arts to put a thug behind bars. The burglar who shoots hi parents is presented a figure of pathos. You never really believe B.W. hates criminals. So it has a hollow center.It's also bizarrely Manichean. None of these horrible conspiracy plots and arch-villains existed before Bruce starts dressing up.Katie Holmes who's brain has been rented to Scientology still looks like she's about 16, and the scarecrow also. You begin to feel that no one over twenty-two can land a decent job in Gotham. The scarecrow guy is at least as scary with his mask off, with his weird plasticene face and lips. When you look at him you just start to think they couldn't talk Ryan Phillipe into the part. Chicago has never looked more brooding.",5,1,6,26 June 2005
Saving Private Ryan," A pile of corn
","I successfully avoided this until seeing Band of Brothers, which raised my previously low interest in Spielberg productions; having seen one too many of his mawkish, sentimental pieces of malarkey. Instead, it turns out it was wise to skip this for almost a decade.A troop that has just landed at Normandy is diverted to move 100m into France and find a single private whose value has just gone up. And sure... they walk the whole way (never even hitching a ride) They encounter provisioned troops every fifteen minutes along the way (any of which would have been more efficiently tasked with the mission.) and they find Ryan not alone & lost behind enemy-lines (maintaining radio silence, or in imminent danger); but amidst another platoon (also provisioned) and ready to take on a mission against 4 German tanks and about 80 Germans. Really... what a bunch of schlock!Why do people make up stories to tell about WW2 to show their respect for those who fought it? Make up characters? Invent a phony mission that never occurred? What? ...the hundreds of thousands of personal stories that exist didn't have enough dramatic range? This is a brazen slap in the face to all who fought. S.P.R. is just so much retrograde 1950's storytelling, and Spielberg doesn't have it in him to recognize cinematic cheese when he smells it. There's so much time for soldiers pouring out their hearts & having profound discussions that it's a wonder they even had time for a war. Spielberg is only a shade subtler than flashing subtitles every now and then that say, 'CRY NOW!' and 'WAVE THE FLAG!' I'm as susceptible as anyone to patriotism, but come on. The 3 stars I gave it are for the battle sequences. Every time the action slows & Spielberg needs to come up with something dramatic he delivers a pile of corn... and earns a barrel of lemons. Structurally this feels like a grab-bag of scenes made for an even longer movie. They find private Ryan almost effortlessly.And what's with the all-star cast, Hanks, Giamatti, Diesel, Damon, Danson, Hines, Ribisi... I can't imagine any of these guys are WW2 figures because they're all so overexposed in the current timeframe.I didn't need this giant pile of malarkey and all it's cheap sentiment to make me feel a debt to the Allies in WW2. I have reality to do that.",3,6,14,20 October 2007
Lawrence of Arabia," half an epic
","When I first saw this, I was leaving the phase of my life where I could be tricked by good production values into thinking I had actually seen quality. A friend of mine loves it, but you could probably write 'great man narrative' on an index card and show it to him and he would get excited and start clapping. I'm open to a 'great man narrative' but at 4 hours, I'd like other supporting ideas, and belonging to the most advanced species on the planet, I have this goofy idea that a movie should ask me to think. At it's worst, Lawrence is a motion-postcard. I'll watch 'Being There' 20 times for each viewing of Lawrence of Arabia.At the time of my first viewing, it did remind me how vivid location photography is, compared to junky attempts to fake it; the photography is simply amazing. Even by the half hour mark, it's really well-made; editing, crisp lenses, great restoration. As epics go, it one-ups competitors like Spartacus by shooting every single exterior scene in the great outdoors, and never cheating inside the studio. It's also remarkable to see a director in the 60s willing to shoot at a darker end of the spectrum than Hollywood is comfortable with.But the movie is a hard sell. Maurice Jarre's theme is shoved down your throat at every opportunity. In a 4 hour movie, it would have been nice if subsequent musical motifs were developed. Whoever decided we should first hear the theme under the credits, while we look down at ten square yards of a motorcycle court should be shot. Is there something transcendent about concrete? A very clumsy & dumb decision.Early on the movie addresses rare topics, like male camaraderie, the naturalized expatriate life arc, etc. As it continues it becomes more generic and less well-made. It gets into heraldic, hagiographic mode and can't escape. Sadly, the 'only one man can save us' line of crap has been paying regular dividends ever since. (Everything from Dances with Wolves & The Postman to every Schwartzeneggar movie) To miss the very high quality of the first hour or two is a crime, but when I get nearer the end, I begin to sympathize with its detractors. Bombast is one of my least favorite flavors. I really doubt if most fans understand what the hell is going on in the movie. The developments and conflicts feel pretty arbitrary.Despite being wrong on many many details, a movie that could both reach the western audience and not treat Arabs like villainous scum is notable for doing exactly that. What it says for diplomacy and the rewards of working past cultural barriers is, for me, more important The first two hours are a pleasure, but I've never seen a movie yet that can make art out of massive social movements. The last hour offers nothing comparable to the rest of the movie. It reaches the height of idiocy when every single person in a sort of huge Arab congress has to depend on the single white man who can save them. And scenes of O'Tooles quivering, bug-eyed version of crazy is extraordinarily unsubtle in a movie playing in 70mm. The most annoying recurring detail is the cutesy appellation 'Orrence' they give to him, despite the fact they can all pronounce 'L' just fine everywhere else. Phony pidgin English is not worthy of the movies better ideas.",6,6,21,15 January 2008
JFK," Mr Smith goes to Dealy Plaza
","There's a great movie waiting to be made about the Kennedy killings and the sheer hogwash the government expected people to accept. Oliver Stone's JFK movie (assessed apart from it's scandal-rich premiere) is a lousy, scatterbrained, corny, half-baked movie. It's made ineptly and it's composed of the flimsiest string of three lonely conceits. 1) A very crappy star turn by Costner, again playing Mr. Morality 2) One or two sequences that clearly received more of Stone's attention (they actually build - Fletcher Prouty) and 3) An all star cast. The script may offer the wobbliest plot ever filmed; a single-minded crusader doesn't have a prayer of winning his laughably assembled conspiracy case; also... he has the defacto 'whiny wife' (Spacek). Stone hopes to provide enough surface activity that you won't notice he has no guiding concept, that the all-star cast is actually undermining the movie and the damned thing is going nowhere. Despite earnestness and good intentions, it has no momentum, no ending and precious little intelligence. An overwrought score beats you over the head in an effort to inject some intensity.The climactic court case is just absurd (and belabored). It feels like Stone needed both a dramatic climax and a morality showdown, and manufactured this weak, weak case to those ends. The case is composed of barely-connected, legally ridiculous courtroom moments; Garrison badgers people whose connection to Clay Shaw is indecipherable until his final 20 words attempt a weak link. If the case actually went as depicted, it's no surprise Garrison lost, because he speechifies about everything except how Clay Shaw is related to the killing.In casting every role large, Stone bowdlerizes the assassination by advancing a solution that looks trifling compared to the scale of the machinations and his production. In the end JFK's assassination is pinned on some utterly nonthreatening gay bogeyman (an idea that has no place to go) for god knows what reason ...how very small.In need of passion, the movie pours on the straw-man antics; there's a zero-sum game fight every twenty minutes. Ridiculous lines like 'Let justice rain till the heavens fall' and 'We're through the looking-glass now, people...' intended to make major dramatic moments are just bad dramatics. Not helping any of this, are some very poor, over-the-top southern accents. Everyone from the south doesn't talk with a full-on, corn-pone accent, but tell a star his character is from the south and it's vocal amateur hour. Metcalf is quite bad. Costner sounds like Elmer Fudd, despite the fact that Jim Garrison himself has a cameo in the damned movie, and has NO regional accent whatsoever. (?!)The controversy that surrounded the movies opening reflects a legitimate failing of the movie. You would have to be a JFK assassination scholar to detect and determine what elements are factual, and what has been completely manufactured by Stone for the movie. It's all presented as fact. The best that can be said of the movie is, thank God Stone got access to the Zapruder film so that it could be disseminated at a massive, irretrievable scale; placing it in front of incorruptible audience-eyes that won't forget what they've seen. The horror of the 26 second Zapruder film is indelible.",2,2,20,7 October 2008
The Number 23," lost in its own baroque designs
","This is the usual 'happy guy who discovers he's the true author of his new, favorite book which is really an epic confession describing how he killed his previous girlfriend' story we've seen countless times before. The movie eats up so much time visualizing the damned book that it will obviously turn out to be a convoluted back-story. Gee what a surprise ...it turns out to be a convoluted back-story.I can't wait for the era in which film-makers learn that a little production design goes a long way, and that design is still no substitute for a worthy script. Number 23 never accidentally veers towards human psychology or natural behavior of any sort, in deference to reverse engineering the entire story backwards from its zowie (not so zowie) twist ending, which makes the foreground an afterthought; and it's complete obedience to the production design gods. Writer Fernley Phillips (!) can not steer this idea to a good movie. It's just another overwrought consumable. If you're hoping to see yet another breathy, sincere narrator explain his way through over-produced imagery, this is for you. I know I really craved another closeup of a clock with its second-hand ticking ominously. 23 is shockingly amateurish.This is a companion piece to 'The Nines' which, despite reviews to the contrary, is actually crappier. As limp as 23 is, it represents a step up for atrocious movie director Joel Schumacher.",2,2,7,5 February 2009
Hellboy," Okay
","For such a piece of escapism (and for someone as cynical about movies as I am) I didn't expect much from this. But it has its moments. The nasty demon dogs are pretty lame, but other elements (a robotic villain, an enormous pendulum that destroys an escape route, etc.) persuaded me after a long time that imagination and creativity do occasionally turn up in Hollywood.But I managed to not look up even once from my work as the final prolonged, noisy, climactic battle (presumably intended to be very stimulating) took place. 'Gee I wonder if explosions will be involved.' After thirty years of look-alike climaxes, this 'very stimulating' conclusion is exhausted. It's the same-old, same-old dumb fight/crescendo that I can't wait for Hollywood to get as tired of, as I am. It hasn't been satisfying in thirty years.Sienna Miller does zilch for me. She's just kind of puffy-faced and sullen here.Ron Perlman is also good in The Name of the Rose.",6,1,2,15 November 2007
The Mist," So very, very, very silly
","Bugs are scary and icky, are't they? So then it must follow that a bug a hundred times bigger than a wasp must be a hundred times scarier. And a wasp blown up a thousand times must be a thousand times scarier. Um, no. And I don't find bugs scary. If that's the best King can come up with, it's just more confirmation that he's a writer with no ideas. Also with reality factionalized into annoyance, why on earth, when I go to the movie for a little brainless entertainment, would I want to see a micro-society break into combative factions and annoy me further? The massive flaw in the movie is that the incident takes a format that allows the exact same conventional scenes we've seen for decades to transpire. When I see lovers having their last conversation, people begging to die, zealots spouting scripture, a horde of white characters with a token black guy... When I see panicked people trying to be deep ('I mean people are basically good right?')... And always a little nipper who can poop some sentiment into things... I just roll my eyes. No one even turns on a radio or makes a phone call in this formless malarkey. How does Thomas Jayne keep choosing these crappy scripts?Most obnoxiously, the movie steals a 'Dead can Dance' song from the astonishing movie 'Baraka' to make you feel something profound about giant bugs. I mean, really!",1,2,11,7 June 2008
The Elephant Man," shallow, pathos machine
","This is the story of Joseph Merrick (here called John Merrick). Whenever I watch this movie I appreciate that it was filmed in b&w, and I cry a bit. It always makes me consider what an unbelievably cruel god it must be to take an already difficult Victorian life, add to that poverty and abandonment, and add to that virulent tumors that misshape a man to this degree, insuring absolute cruelty from his society, and that he can never seek employment. It's why I always have a big 'No thank you' for religion. But I'm astonished that David Lynch (!) didn't attempt more with the material than mere sentiment. He tries to squeeze tears from viewers over and over. Apparently audiences are too stupid to get a point unless he wraps pathos-scented wrapping paper around a cinder-block and drops it on your toe.The movie vacillates between two types of scenes. A) Sympathetic figures cry, or cause Merrick to cry, and b) Merrick's heartless antagonists show up at the hospital and torment him. That's 90 percent of the movie. No doubt the hospital situation was better than the sideshow mistreatment, but visitors with an agenda treat him with a treacly, phony solicitousness that must've soon become tiresome even to him. As in, 'Hey famous actress, I don't like abuse but I don't need your self-congratulatory pity either.' It always grates on me. For how little John Hurt is given to do, you could stick anyone under all that lumpy make-up. The character of Merrick is two-dimensional, if you're being generous.The movie has very low dramatic stakes. I had sympathy for Merrick before the movie existed. I don't need Lynch to pump me for more. The developments in the script are repetitive and poor. Merrick is safely sequestered from his enemies in a hospital, after the first 20 minutes, but you can't do much with that dramatically. So, the script inexplicably allows cretins to reach him in his room over and over (with and without whores). Seemingly any villain can get to him inside his confines, and at the films weakest point, when some cheap tension is needed, his antagonist just knocks on his window, and voilà, now Merrick is in some quarters on the first floor, despite early interior sequences which showed people mounting stairs to reach him. Each ward invasion is more eye-rolling than the previous one, with shouting, etc. At one point an entire drunken midnight party converges on his room, and the ten-person strong, screaming crowd still fails to awaken the hospital staff. Gee, that's some terrific security that lets people roam your building at night; and some masterful handling of conflict. Come on! The absurd, manufactured conflict becomes very trying.",4,24,46,11 August 2009
The Game," Terrible!
","There are two reactions to this movie - People like it or hate it. Put me in the second camp. Whether it was 'The Freshman' or 'The Truman Show,' you've seen this bad, bad movie before. It's the wish fulfillment of the arrogant. It goes something like this in 'the Game:' You may be an a**hole but you're such an important a**hole that everyone in your life (even Daniel Shor) is playacting just for your benefit, just to guide you to a lesson. It still flatters self-important d**kheads into thinking that people in their lives are pawns manipulated for their benefit.Regardless of continual trick endings, you've already suspected the whole thing is a ruse, because if it's not, it's a pretty standard and boring conspiracy thriller. The movie has a few funny moments early on then it becomes mysterious, then it become more mysterious, then more mysterious, then more mysterious, then more mysterious, then more mysterious, then more mysterious, then... Get the picture? Did you really want me to say 'more mysterious' again? No! Because part of the fun of a mystery is being allowed to play along. Providing developments instead of underlining the mystery again and again. 'Contact' did this beautifully. Although it eventually gets nowhere, every fifteen minutes or so you're allowed to see a little more of a full picture. Here, the mystery just deepens without any actual developments. Wasn't anyone in a preview shouting, 'Yes, David WE GET IT!'? It gets so tedious that I actually skipped three or four chapters onthe DVD. I just didn't care. It reminded me of 'Total Recall' and 'Sleuth.' 2 other movies that wear you out with pointless plot-twists and reversals.Hollywood airheads think they recognize this as an idea film. 'The Game' remains a game to no matter to what absurd scale it grows, even though there is no way you could even anticipate the random causes and effects in a single day of your life. Free will is completely erased in this movie. That's just how smart the controllers of the game are. Sadly David Fincher isn't that smart and there are plot-holes you could throw talentless scriptwriters through. How did they know where he'd jump off the building? Don't ask such silly questions! Surface effects are much more important than credibility. And that final 'wow' ending (Think of this movie as a really long tedious sermon) matters more than any internal logic. As idea films go, this one tugs - If rich pompous businessmen require a ruse this elaborate and expensive, who would actually care about them?Finchers ideas are really lame. I can now add this to the list of very bad Fincher movies. Seven, Alien 3, and it's so bad that it even makes me reconsider Fight Club and it's lame ending.The people I know who like this movie are self-important blowhards most in need of a lesson like this. I knew enough to suspect their raves. I would jam this baby into my top five worst movies of all time list.",1,17,36,8 January 2002
Shrek the Third," Skip it
","Shrek 3 trusts it's audience so little and has squandered so much good will in it's effort to milk cash from viewers, that it places it's characters on screen and nervously has them do stupid, 'funny' things to reignite your interest and get the movie rolling. For fifteen minutes it barely considers plot, because maybe you don't like plot. So how about another pratfall?When a funeral is held and the song 'Live and Let Die' is mined for unavailable laughs, you begin to understand just how bad this is going to be. The creators talked themselves into a dumb pop culture reference without any understanding of the damned song. The song is about revenge: The scene is about revenge about as much as Star Wars is about French Structuralism... so what the hell is it doing here? Hey guys, consider reading a book some time; then when you propose a joke you can know when what you have isn't funny. It's called 'having depth.' Instead of admiring a writer's cleverness, a viewer sits in the theater envisioning the limp team meeting where that idea was born, accompanied by desperate, wrong-headed titters from weak minds.Mike Myers should move on and find yet another movie to shoehorn his tiresome Scottish accent into.For the record the humans in this series have always creeped me out.",1,27,35,9 June 2007
The Longest Day," some potential / no delivery
","Daryl Zanuck took this on as a personal project, but earnestness cannot overcome run-of the mill conception & direction. The merit of this film is to tell the story of the D-Day invasion of Normandy. It's not to create art, or even to elicit sentiment. So to be as factual as possible, (or at least market it as such) they filmed on actual locations which are still recognizable today. A puzzling disconnect occurs in the production: John Wayne is there to 'John Wayne' things up (he plays another hard-on), trying to make it a personal story but if ever there was as story about group sacrifice, D-Day is it. This narrative problem is never successfully addressed. As with all war films the goals are so poorly explained that you don't care if the allies derail a train, or save a bridge; because although characters have talked (and talked and talked) for an hour before things get going, you still don't understand what specific goal has been achieved. It's all poorly explained.My french guide through Normandy took us through his hometown 'Ouisterham' in the film, whose distinct cliff-walled harbor is featured in the movie. This sequence begins with a long aerial tracking shot that comes down the harbor. It's one of the best sequences. It occurs nowhere near the beach. When we revert back to the beach, some time later to resume the Mitchum/Albert storyline, it actually feels out of order.The on-location filming in undermined by some of the worst rear-screen insertions I've ever seen. The actors actually cast shadows on the rearscreen. At one point about nine actors are squeezed onto a barely passable set of an aircraft carier bridge, with the sea faked in behind them. Red Buttons is here playing the same annoying sappy twerp he always does. Richard Beymer is trying to give an electrifying modern performance but he has nothing to do.The English army is constantly depicted as dorks with silly priorities. English culture used to interest me. Now I can't imagine why; it doesn't stimulate an ounce of interest.The movie never wavers from the battle narrative. This is most unfortunate as we watch maybe twenty early scenes establish, re-establish and belabor the same points. We don't get a scene of the army greeted as liberators, so as far as prestige pix go it's pretty chilly.Sean Connery shows up and spews some indecipherable lines. Three single-named stars (Arletty, Fabian, somebody else) are in the movie along with anyone who passed through Hollywood in 1956 in possession of a penis (Paul Anka, Ricard Beymer, Jeff Hunter, Sal Mineo, Robert Mitchum, Eddie Albert, John Wayne, Richard Burton, Peter Lawford, Henry Fonda, Edmund O'Brien, George Segal, rod Steiger, Tom Tryon, Robert Wagner) & Roddy MacDowell (whom I would argue could not possibly have had a penis).Graphic deisgn. I really can't understand why graphic design has achieved the reputation it has. Here 'The Longest Day' is spelled out with long letters, literalizing the stupidest aspect a weak-minded designer could muster.The end theme doesn't help the tone. It's a peppy whistling march that gives way to an asinine chorus, as if to say don't think about the gravitas of this heavy topic, just go out and think pretty thoughts.",3,5,17,18 September 2007
Slap Shot," A mess (not recommended)
","This is as mistaken as a comedy ever got towards thinking moviegoers seeking a few laughs required an elaborate plot (or any plot). There is no scene involving Paul Newman that is funny or interesting. I just didn't care if he repaired his marriage and understood why his wife wouldn't want him back. His character is a doofus. The movies merits and fun have nothing to do with plot or star power. If you're distracted by the snooze-inducing plot, you might miss some funny situations and lines in the middle. The Hansens are a very funny idea especially considering the timeframe; the further development of the anti-hero to the point where they even cease being physically attractive.The 60s anti-establishment viewpoint is eeking into absolutely establishment movies like this. Newman reasons his way to a now untrackable blow-up for unknown reasons. Whenever a laugh is needed you can be sure gay men and women will provide an easy punchline. The combative Lyndsey Crouse subplot is wrong-headed in every way. To see Jill Clayburgh young, playing this dumb, horny role is strange and unpleasant. Michael Ontkean plays a constipated pretty boy. God the 70s were hideous. Awful sound recording/mixing and really ugly technicolor process.Dozens of sports movie tried to recapture it's success. I love the movie Bull Durham but I had no idea how much of it's vibe Ron Shelton stole from this. Bull Durham is a virtual reshuffling of scenes from Slapshot.",3,11,37,12 May 2004

","Ugh. Movie is superdumb. Jokes are corny. The chance to make the surfer interesting was in his face; which instead they decided would remain generic and art deco.

After seeing 'Pi,' I see that 'Requiem was more accomplished: a definite improvement. Pi has interesting germs of ideas but only adds up to stylized insanity. This is the same vision of crazy that lazy film students (who don't want to view what other people have already done along this theme) keep making (Videodrome, THX 1138).

"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Important events... average movie
","In the 1950s, Senator Joe McCarthy misappropriated the entire machinery of state to harass nobodies and consolidate his own power. What he did was fundamentally, grotesquely unAmerican. The combined talents of Clooney and baseball impresario Mark Cuban have reproduced that narrative. But they are not aware of subtlety. This film presents important events but does so with such a veneer of solemnity and self-admiration that it's not very edifying. The most dramatic moment in the film comes oddly when Army Counsel Joseph Welch (in historical footage) takes self-loathing runt lawyer Ed Cohn to task, and the McCarthy house of cards comes tumbling down. The rest is an elaborate frame for that footage. Strathairn's delivery of Murrow's speeches is so bloodless and off-putting that it kills the movie's momentum, and it makes for an extremely poor ending. The decision to pretend this is 'All The Presidents Men 2' is a bad one. It's not that story. The movie is inert for much too long.What's more important to know is that Joe McCarthy was dead within 3 years of being knocked out of power, from alcoholism. A fitting end for such a contemptible human being. Would that such alcoholism might strike the descendants of McCarthy and Father Coughlin; Limbaugh, Coulter, Beck, O'Reilly, etc. Most Americans can't even figure out that the freedom they pay lip service to, arrives in their community as 'individuality' which absolutely horrifies them, and which they immediately attempt to crush.",5,3,7,4 June 2010
The Last Emperor," il Somnambulist
","When this came out I liked it because it flattered my pretensions about being worldly. In retrospect, I can't find anything in it that made me sit through it twice. 30 minutes in, it still hasn't gotten moving. It has no forward impulse. The emperor Pu-Yi is such a passive historical figure, it's hard to care about him... or even to relate to him. It's harder still when Bertolucci is done with him. Even as Pu-Yi tries on ill-fitting personas. Even with an editorializing score, telling you where you're supposed to feel something, the movie is numbing and rambling. No amount of shouting Chinese revolutionaries can inject drama into what is hopelessly undramatic and undramatized. You'd think Bertolucci knew his task was to find a throughline for this muddle, but instead he's a muddle amplifier. He's found nothing to dramatize; or perhaps more correctly, his entire dramatizing urge is crushed by his anomie urge. For a Marxist, Bertolucci is way too impressed by opulence, and gleaming surfaces. 1987's brightest; Ryuichi Sakamoto & David Byrne both contribute efforts that did powerfully little for their careers.",2,6,19,24 December 2009
Big Fish," Pure Cornball! Fried Green Tomatoes meets Forrest Gump
","A movie in which the current story is merely the flimsiest excuse for the backstory. From the moment the narration started, I was never involved in this storyline. My friends and I were not on board for another southern tall-tale. Is there any other kind of movie that Hollywood allows southern characters to appear in? For a hanky movie to work you do have to care about the characters. The second time Albert Finney asks for water you'll guess what's coming.Tim Burton is getting much attention for his newfound maturity. What that means is that whatever the merits of his quirky, poorly-scripted previous movies, he's now signed on to one of the two acceptable messages for Hollywood dramas to have: 1) You gotta have heart. 2) Believe in the magic. Both of which are pure cornball. In this case it's #2. Ready-made themes excuse viewers from developing or even thinking much. If you're an adult with the mind of an eight-year-old you're in for a treat. If you're a week away from your own death, this could be the ideal movie for you. Otherwise, prepare to roll your eyes and hold your nose. Just bring whatever sentimental feelings you've developed at the Hallmark store and install them wholesale into this story.Is it any wonder that this is the last movie Spalding Grey watched before killing himself?",2,13,26,6 January 2004
2001: A Space Odyssey," Miraculous
","I love this movie. I give it enormous credit for being one of the earliest (and still rare) movies that cannot be watched without engaging the world of ideas; due to both the subject matter, and the terse style by which Kubrick advances the story. The viewer is asked to make enormous leaps between disparate and often wordless sequences, that don't telegraph meaning overtly. Understanding or enjoying the movie isn't possible if you refuse to be thoughtful or if you're a passive viewer. This was an affront to older audiences (See 'Rock Hudson') conditioned to believe that entertainment was the first, last and only purpose for movies; and it was a revolution for younger audiences who were ready and willing to explore films potential, and see what was next in the 60s. The movie of ideas, and not the asinine, self-important 'issue' movie that Hollywood loves to reward, is the highest use for film. Sadly, most movies ask nothing of viewers. Issue movies only ask that you bring your overblown, overvalued morality with you, and reach a conclusion the entire culture already agrees on. Give me a difficult movie that makes some demands.2001 is also entertaining. Humanity reduced to a pissing match with a computer is both chilling and extremely funny. (HAL: 'Dave, I honestly think you ought to sit down calmly, take a stress pill, and think things over.') Although I think the HAL plot line is a bit normative for a movie this ambitious.I'm not a member of the Kubrick cult, but I'm in awe; the movie is absolutely fearless, audacious & cinematic. It's a Rorschach test and a zen koan. It trains your attention purposefully on the awesome & the mundane; reminding viewers that most communication does not advance any complex plot in our lives or any noble purpose. It's used to pass almost useless info back and forth, to achieve trivial goals and to make small talk. Socially, we are ants.The attempt to predict how a mission... how an excavation on the moon would look, etc. are either dead-on or very interesting guesses. The movie would have been intriguing even if all it did was introduce the sober design logic it uses, and it's general thoughtfulness; i.e. the monolith has the dimensions of the first three ordinal numbers, squared: 1x4x9. On this viewing I was struck by the question of how the canvas of a movie screen might be used. Is film imagery about portraying things that aid the viewer in constructing a narrative, or is it about vicariously experiencing a characters vantage? The sequence in Dave Bowman's cage accepts both readings depending on which way it's to be understood. The sequences with the monolith suggest that the genre 'ghost story' is separated from 'metaphysical exploration' by only the thinnest of lines.Every frame of this movie is thoughtful AND beautiful. Hollywood has been able to do that, what... 4 times?. I'm a big fan of Citizen Kane, but that movie concerns, first and foremost, film technique, a wunderkind narrative, and a clever borrowing of a magnate's life. It doesn't make me think deeply about non-filmic ideas to any great degree; other than the obvious bromides about money not buying happiness, controlling people isn't being loved, etc.I'm struck now by how 2001 is overlooked in the 'best films of all time' polls. 2001 is the better film, making it (for me) the most important film made in film history. Kane will have to settle for 2nd.Critic Stephen Hunter of the Washington Post quibbles that the movie is dumb because 2001 wasn't like this. (?!) How can you even respond to a remark that far off-course?",9,3,9,25 November 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," saccharine...
","When I learned that Michael Gondry had directed this a few weeks ago, I became interested in seeing it. Perhaps a dozen of Gondry's videos are so clever and rich that I had hopes his movies would be too. The preview for his next one looks to be on the grating and precious side; something out of the 80s. I was truly surprised that this movie is such an overwrought trifle. Overwrought in that the relationship is barely even registers with a viewer before it requires saving, and a trifle in that many pivotal scenes and the resolution are so weakly written that any of three other relationship in the movie seem more dramatically interesting, and more scaled for the focus of a feature length movie. They don't bear the burden of having to prop up Gondry's rep with some gimmick. The Carrey/Winslet relationship tries to wrestle itself out from under the FX but it never has a prayer. The idea is too intrusive.Videos seem to be Gondry's ideal format. Ideas that can bear five minutes of exploration are his forte. This is not an insult. Let forever be by the Chemical Bros is simply astonishing. As for movies, this is it? The only question Gondry's efforts in the cinema will be answering is how many times will he be allowed to remake Benny & Joon? Addiitonally he's been imprisoned by his age and thus must make something not too far afield from previously acknowledged high-watermarks by his peers. ESOTSM has one eye firmly glued to Being John Malkovich.That said, I was willing to give this the benefit of the doubt up till about the one hour mark where the movies most awful scenes start flowing. Jim Carrey acting like a five year old hiding out under a table. It's just a cheesy, stupid, sphincter-tightening place I wasn't willing to go and thus began a fast forwarding workout. By coincidence this is also where the films poor structure becomes a real liability. As music videos don't require scripts, the movies major flaw is the structuring of the film over a long hour and 45 minutes, and the immature script.Heaping insult on injury, the central relationship is composed only of childish moments, and Winslet is asked to portray nothing more than a b*tchy freak, a surrogate Bjork, the type of girl who should cease to intrigue after the age of 20. I can only see the marketing angles when I see movies now, and the damaged girl who is non-threatening to the target audience of straight guys with low self-esteem is not satisfying to a mature adult viewer. Oooh a misfit who creates her own world.... This is love? making snow angels, girls who dress up potatoes, Puh-lease...There is room for good performances here. Kristin Dunst (who I don't care for) does OK in an adult role and looks quite fine. Mark Ruffalo who has generally been consigned to sensitive hunk perfs is allowed to play a fully-realized and well-acted goofball here. It turns out he has a range viewers haven't seen previously. Whether he's dancing badly in his underwear, or tripping over something and working with it, he's really committed to this character which makes it fun to watch. As supporting roles go, this is a good one and he does good things with it. A few line readings in the movie (from various actors) are really terrific. Overall this precious trip through cheap, easy pathos and childish hogwash invariably reappears in french cinema. Seemingly only the french can stomach emotional lives that receive this treacly treatment. (Ma Vie en Rose, Subway, The Professional, etc.)",2,2,6,26 July 2006
Taken," sour lemon
","Taken is a serious lemon. Neeson deserves a better script. Viewers deserve a better movie. This is so monomaniacal it becomes thuddingly unsubtle in the first ten minutes. We get sentiment and we get violence, and we get super-creepy father/daughter scenes, that made my toes curl. Across his career, Luc Besson vacillates between almost passable escapism (Fifth Element) and utterly unredeemable dreck (Big Blue, Subway, Leon) The script is so bare-bones that it results in laugh-out-loud developments. 45 minutes after lading in Paris, a girl is kidnapped for a Euro-prostitution ring? Um, yeah. And you can identify a single criminal in Europe from two words spoken into a phone! Liam Neeson passes himself off as a French agent without speaking French or having an accent. Terrific. There's dumb, there's DUMB! and then there's Taken.",1,4,15,14 June 2009
Alice in Wonderland," Vapid.. even according to a very low 'Tim Burton' standard
","This was destined to be bad because Alice in Wonderand is unfilmable. Lewis Carroll had the attention span of a hummingbird. The book is non-linear and geared for the easily distracted. It needed to be rewritten to film it, but this? This is a crummy, extraordinarily feeble, go-nowhere, girl-power lecture that would have been pitiful & laughable 30 years ago. Anyone who gave this a high rating, has a very thin cliché index. The script is rotten. The story is barely fleshed out beyond the schematic. The pacing is glacial. The acting is a joke. Anne Hathaway is totally lost. She reaches 'high-school play' level acting and no more (ditto for Crispin Glover). Depp just adds one more affected freak to his resume.Tim Burton wouldn't know a finished script if it bit him on the a.ss. This is the absolute worst film he's made in his long, bad career, and that's really saying something. I wish Carter and Burton would depart Hollywood and go live in a toy castle or a dollhouse somewhere to spare us any more of this junk.",1,4,10,30 May 2010
Avatar," Dances with Smurfs in Ferngully
","In Avatar, a bunch of marines in a big spacecraft (with a rotating segment - Aliens) are woken from hyper-sleep (Alien) and drop shipped to a new planet (Aliens) in a vehicle with a snub-nosed cockpit (Aliens). The planet is inhabited by ten-foot tall blue aliens (Battlefield Earth) who worship a big tree (Pochahontas) One of the marines is able to mix in with the natives (Ferngully) and comes to love them. The native culture glows as does their forest with a conveniently visible energy religion (Tron). Something meaningful is conveyed with the phrase 'I SEE you!' (Joy Luck Club). In the end there is a war featuring man-shaped robot-exoskeletons (Mars Attacks, Transformers, Star Wars, Aliens, District 9, MIB, Robocop, Terminator). And a Latina Marine sacrifices herself (Aliens). What surprising about Avatar is how shamelessly derivative it is, while 20-year olds ignorant of older movies tell you it's the most original, most important thing since glow-in-the-dark bread. I hope to never see another movie with the exoskeleton idea again. Because 20 years later, films have thoroughly exhausted the concept. There is some good stuff in Avatar. Chief among it, is a subversive viewer-identity concept that has you rooting against your own species/planet. It's perfectly appropriate that Cameron sees through the Iraq war and the moral bankruptcy of both corporations and the Right; but he dares to say five thousand marines with tunnel-vision being led by a hot-head who's never created anything, are NOT the pride of the nation. And he's right. It's very strange to be delighted when the humans finally get decimated. A strange moment to witness... and it's brought to you by the growing revulsion people feel for a misused army and for evil corporations in general, and the sickening cross-pollination of the two.Two gigantic moral quandaries are never even addressed: Isn't it unethical to make living things that have no life until a person avatars them? And the marine is still selling out the natives waaaaaay after he's come to admire them ??? The movie is not really science fiction... it is fantasy, which is not really my cup of Q'thar. If you've seen one Native American documentary and two National Geographic specials, you've seen these ideas before. (Why do I keep buying the 3-D glasses? In every 3-D movie, the effect is interesting for exactly ten minutes.)",3,8,16,5 January 2010
Chariots of Fire," I say chaps, running is fun!
","A Cambridge Jew (Harold Abrams) and an unaffiliated Christian (Eric Liddell) make their way to the 1924 Paris Olympics. One, by far the more interesting character, spends much time griping about anti-Semitism (not shown ..?) and the other feels the lord needs another missionary. The basic problem with C.o.F. is that the writers can't scare up a decent conflict. And Abrams and Liddel share one flimsy greeting in a locker room, so it remains a puzzle why they share a movie. Not helping things is the chilly distance the production adopts; although the cast is quite extensive, no character develops any issue unrelated to the official storyline, which is crystal-clear after ten minutes.Liddel is the sort who can't wait to tell everyone how humble he is, and that everyone should aspire to be humble like him. He's hen-pecked by his lemon-sucking sister (quite a trick) who's using religion to make him bend to her will, not God's. Together they have their Christian humility turned up to eleven. Abram's (Ben Cross) storyline is slightly better, but nothing you haven't seen before. If anti-Semitism is wrong, one gets the feeling it's only because it's beneath him as a classy, urbane snob. Everyone suffers over trifles rather photogenically, none better than Cross, who is an unusually striking man. This is the kind of movie that viewers watch and passively dispense a rave in response to overt 'Best Picture' production values, in the mistaken belief that great movies are about taste. But as usual, taste has little to do with art.As a travelogue the movie inspires with historic locations, international travel, and it can't help but make a viewer more worldly. As a poor pre-teen it provided me with fantasies of opportunities and accomplishments, but as an 'inspirational movie' in 2009, it's rather inert. Vangelis' intentionally anachronistic music once worked but is now obtrusive.",5,7,16,21 February 2009
Mission: Impossible," Mission Incorrigible
","Mission Impossible is the movie that could only come from DePalma and Cruise. The former is a hack and the latter is a real drip. The plot is set in motion when the good guys 'knock list' is stolen. But the thieves learn it was a bogus knock list, so it's vitally important to replace the knocklist or the bad guys will realize their goods are bad. Mostly the plot is an excuse for characters to say 'knock list' a lot, and you get to see Cruise play an unbearably cocky ass in Eruope for a change. Plotwise it's pretty stale; One guess as to who turns out to be the bad guy; yep, that's right, the person who was supposed to be the good guy. Gee, that's fresh. Cruise projects the kind of phony confidence of the guy who knows the 'right' answer to give to those idiot job-interview questions. You know what I mean... 'What's your worst habit?' followed by the correct answer that cloaks your success in flaws clothing: 'I drive myself too hard.' or 'I cry myself to sleep at night over my lack of flaws.' The type of deeply phony horse-sh*t that makes you roll your eyes and fills you with revulsion for the ass who would actually say it; the type of person who would give those answers and really sell it, not realizing that an impartial observer would retch over his teeming phoniness.Keep your eyes on Cruise though. The heyday of this type of this meathead tripe has lasted anachronistically into the era of the metrosexual. It's due to expire some time in the next 3 months. Cruise hasn't figured out that this kind of sales job makes him look really old, not young. Chicks with fake boobs, guys who drive hummers, and those who wish to join either group will like this movie.",1,21,41,19 June 2006
A Clockwork Orange," A single idea, buried under surface activity
","I've never been a big fan of this movie. I'm indifferent to the violence which I find unconvincing and comical. Instead I find the movie to be so ridiculously streamlined that for all it's outrageousness, just ends up feeling like a children's story, underscoring its moral over and over. Kubrick has reduced the whole production to a schematic argument with no real detail. There's just nothing else to consider in the movie except a singular, remedial idea about free will. Two hours and 16 minutes is way too much time to be this ideoogically barren. The first part proceeds rapidly enough, but the obvious developments after the Ludovico treatment drag unmercifully. How could Kubrick make 2001, which is teeming with ideas, and then go on to make this?Its provocations are way over the top as unrefined minds prefer. Patrick McGeehan's grotesque hamming is the most unsubtle thing in a very unsubtle movie. I suspect guys talk themselves into this being a masterpiece in their horny, rebellious teens, then spend the rest of their lives never thinking about it again; continuing to defend their initial position and premature rave. There's nothing going on in this movie. it's like watching a juggler with one ball. Kubrick further undermines his art and the shock of the violence by getting too much titillation out of it; his rape victims are always attractive women with supermodel figures and enormous, spherical breasts. How many nitwits would be raving about this movie is even one of the chicks was out of shape?",4,6,18,1 March 2008
From Hell," yeah, maybe.
","This movie got unusually mean reviews. It is an average movie - it deserves neither scorn, nor adulation. I enjoyed it but it doesn't offer too much that would cause me to watch it again. It's a reasonable effort.Instead of altering the Ripper case willy-nilly to suit their needs, only small changes have been made (they dismiss all but one Ripper letter). So it was nice to see the actual clues of the case appear and be assembled into a coherent storyline; even though the Prince Edward explanation has been discredited. The envisioning of Victorian London is fresh, and the film technique which suggests the passing of time over crime scenes is fine. So it ends up being less dumb than I imagined. Jack the Ripper is wearing the wrong hat though. (Witnesses describe a man in a deerstalker cap, not an opera-style top-hat)Heather Graham is a strange piece of casting for a role that requires a decent accent, and the revisions to Victorian culture itself are absurd. The culture is depicted as having very contemporary, relaxed morals: Annie is a whore; you don't sit in a garden, or visit the Victoria and Albert museum with a whore in 1888. And you just aren't seen in public with anyone but your wife, or there's a scandal. Oh, Mary can read!? Unlikely. Mary has improbable middle-class values and behavior. She'd more likely be a nasty, unwashed, ignorant, uncultured, drunk, prematurely-aging guttersnipe; as Ripper's victims were.The lamest part of the movie is that it hints at two or three options for who might be Jack, then selects the culprit you suspected the first second he was introduced (Gee... that was underwhelming!) And the idea that an underground society actually meets underground (!) is um, quaint.After seeing Sweeney Todd for the first time this week, Burtons' effort looks even less original or thoughtful than I previously granted. All he did was glance at this earlier Depp vehicle; borrow the whole production and add the songs. Heather even ends up living 'by the sea!'",4,2,4,26 December 2007
The Red Violin," an irritating movie
","This is my second try at watching this film, after a long interval, and after thinking I must have been wrong about how much I disliked it the first time. I'm completely open to a fragmented narrative constructed around an object traveling through time but this is thoroughly mediocre film-making and storytelling. Somewhere between the legitimate formats of 'art film' and 'mass entertainment' is the 'failed art film,' which offers only meager nourishment, and the joys of neither. The structure of Violin comes by way of 'The Monkey's Paw,' except here the lowbrow monkey paw is replaced by the snootier totem of a violin. There are two types of tiresome scenes in this movie; people playing the violin... and viewers getting to know a string of aggravating characters. It's too long by an hour to include all those irritating virtuoso performances and familiar/obvious practice sequences. The historical sequences are all lifeless clunkers. This movie also does a pretty bad job with non-sequential time and narrative jumps. When mad lover Victoria pulls a gun and shoots the violin that is coming between her and her lover, I just rolled my eyes. You'v got to be kidding.. that's just over-the-top silly. I was laughing at the wrong points (Actually there are no laughs - it's oh-so-serious!) When the kid dropped dead as he was about to play his concerto, I burst out laughing. There's actually nothing funny about a kid dropping dead, but bad manipulative film-making is a laugh riot.The only good moments I found in this were those depicting the cynical, blood-thirsty cultural revolution in China, which manage to suggest that the meaning of music is transitory. Perhaps you'll be as tired of violin music as I was about halfway through this. This story is as shallow as a puddle.",2,4,8,27 April 2008
Thor," Hercules ...meets Dune ...via Albert Speer
","I liked this. It's fantasy mixed with mythology mixed with a superhero; which turns out to be better than anyone should expect. The most interesting aspects are drawn from the fact that this superhero has a full family, and they're pretty much gods. The scenes with the banished, cheerful, humanized Thor are very charming; and serve to reacquaint viewers with nobility in the male gender (pretty much absent in 2011), much like in the awful Kate and Leopold. I didn't care that it lacked great action setpieces per se, but the climax is a bit too underscaled. Still, I was very moved at least twice; when the King realizes that he must regrettably teach his beloved but ignorant son a whopper of a lesson; and when Thor failed at retrieving his hammer (of all things). Heimdall, the bridge guard, reminds a viewer that old school qualities suffice beautifully in producing a figure of admiration. He's unflinching in his devotion, he's 'steady'. The plot is slightly familiar (The central idea of The Sword in the Stone is lifted shamelessly), but the acting is good, and it's better with language than most movies; which I suspect can be credited to Kenneth Branagh. Kat Dennings as Natalie Portman's assistant earns some laughs with her dry line readings.Thor's home realm (Asgard) looks like the Emerald City as designed by Santiago Calatrava, Albert Speer and Hans Poelig. Not since Bespin (city of pepper mills) has a design aesthetic looked so thoroughly scale-less, unconvincing and cheeseball. The denizens wear things they seem to have bought at Cher's garage sale (although Thor's outfit is pretty great). And the town in New Mexico has 'We GOTTA slash the budget somewhere!!' written all over it. About half an hour of the movie is average or worse, but that not a bad ratio compared to movies that are terrible from start to finish these days (refer to Green Lantern).",7,0,3,2 July 2011
The Fountain," happy tree friends
","Here it is... the movie I knew Aronofsky was capable of; after the 'Look at me, I'm shaking my camera' singularity of Pi... And after the 'starts-in-human-squalor-and-goes-lower' one-note experience of Requiem for a Dream... Aronofsky has contributed a real service to humanity by providing a litmus test for blind-dates. Just drop the name of this piece of overwrought obfuscation into a conversation, and if your new friend gets excited, you can spare yourself an entire evening, at the very least, with a complete poseur.This is the terrific-looking, crappy movie that every director seemingly has in them after The Cell, Flatliners, Blade Runner, Brazil and everything else by Terry Gilliam, and hundreds of other bad movies. It's been art-directed to death. No such care was tendered on the script which is composed of faux-gravitas interrupted by arty posturing, and outbursts instead of drama. Why does someone devise such original visuals, then stumble over cliché after cliché. It seems impossible that Aronofsky hasn't realized there isn't a great movie that doesn't also work on a crappy 10' black and white TV, with a bent hanger for an antenna. The whole show here is prettiness.The films features are keyed to the pretensions of a high-school sophomore, but when you're 37 and you present this material with a straight face, you should be deeply embarrassed. This is the kind of movie where everyone is either talking in breathy, serious whispers or they're shouting. It's about as deep as a perfume commercial, which is what it seems to be taking its cue from. (Calvin Klein's 'The Fountain...') If I ever see another character pull their partner into an overflowing tub again, I'm going to track them both down and make them eat soap.I was completely open to the imagery of the space terrarium. But I was laughing out loud at the conclusion, where Jackman drinks some Ranch dressing from a tree and discovers his inner salad. That's your big conclusion after such a bloated, belabored tease? These muddy 'ideas' are worth about twenty minutes of investigation, or a viewers time. I welcome experimental work, but when it results in material more vapid than a Friday the 13th movie, you're not an artist. If you've compared this movie to Kubrick's 2001, it means you don't understand either of them.Wow. This is just powerfully bad, self-indulgent, adolescent stuff.",1,147,261,25 January 2008
Zombieland," Timing is everything
","Slack pacing kills this. It's feels like it's the directors first movie (uh, bingo!). It also needs a slightly better script; because between episodes of hilarity one notices that it's not very inspired. A Ghostbusters gag with nowhere to go, lingers on screen long enough to make a viewer wince. One gives up early, on the films potential to live up to the classic suggested by the tightly edited preview; which once again gave away all of the best scenes (except one involving a celebrity guest star). Why have rules characters know they have to obey if they have to be abandoned to supply the film with a de rigeur climactic setpiece, which relies on everyone acting 'horror-movie-stupid' again? As the movie ends prematurely, you sit there thinking 'Oh... that was the big climax? ...going to the amusement park was the movie's big goal? ...that was really unsatisfying.' It feels like something major got cut out (or more likely, was never written), leaving the movie lopsided. Eisenberg is not as good or charming as the role demands and one is constantly mindful that the part MUST have been written with Michael Cera in mind. Cera could do a better job in a walk. One assumes Eisenberg's casting is explained by nepotism involving some Hollywood bigwig. Oh, and 'Scream' called, they want their 'horror movie rules' gag back.",5,3,6,5 November 2009
Enemy at the Gates," nicely done
","For the life of me I cannot fathom why this got only half favorable reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. I'm no war movie fan but this is really interesting. The laying-in-wait, sniper vs. sniper thing is fascinating. The imagery looks better than average. Yeah, there are lesser moments. As when falling glass in an abandoned factory lands in a position no piece of glass has ever landed; allowing a German sniper three or four perfect reflections of his clandestine prey. I'd happily watch this a few more times to pick up more details, or to explore the secondary story threads. Law and Fiennes are both good. Even Rachel Weitz can't ruin it.",7,2,6,14 June 2010
The Departed," Pretty standard Scorcese.
","Not much to distinguish this from about 30 other mob movies & not much to think about. It's tooooo long. But DiCaprio has finally grown up. I lost interest just where Marty did, right where he was supposed to write a decent ending. Nicholson is hammy and ridiculous, about as threatening as he was as 'the Joker.' How do you decide to film this on back-lot studio 'streets' and sound-stages? The sets look fake, fake, fake. All exterior skies look fake, fake, fake. 444 Wash street looks about as real as a building on Main St. at Disneyland. Best picture? eh... whatever. It's the meathead version of a chickflick. All decisions have been weighed against the big book of tough guy movie clichés; as sure as the lead in a chick-flick goes on a clothes shopping spree, and is pining for some really dreamy guy.So glad I didn't spend the last 4 years in Boston. You can only take that accent for so long.",3,1,4,19 May 2007
Rosemary's Baby," Rosemary's daycare
","Roman Polanski has made many, many movies that are unexceptional. His fame bewilders me. Nothing stands out as a high point except Chinatown (I haven't seen 'Knife in the Water' or 'Tess'). Any contribution he's made to film concluded more than twenty years ago; his work is just embarrassing, safe and/or dull (The Pianist, Frantic, Oliver Twist, The Ninth Gate, Pirates).R's Baby must have signified the end of the establishment at the time it came out. It's lux-produced and fairly high concept for a 1968 'horror' movie (never show the baby). But this is just misconceived horror sap. Everything is arty to the point that the plot line becomes hopelessly clear very early (Um, thanks for that finale-destroying title), and on a clear day you can see the twist ending coming for days. It did not sustain my interest. I find that whatever this movie might have been, it is utterly derailed by the 1960's version of what femininity was. Farrow is such a chronic distracted, helpless waif/housewife. Her frailty is oversold... she's irritating in the extreme. There's no real ideas in it... nothing to consider except being the mother of the devil.The Dakota is barely exploited for it eerie potential.",2,39,79,5 December 2008
Hercules," pretty irritating
","With Hercules, Disney accomplished a new goal: to get the enjoyable moments of a movie down to just a few seconds. Apparently the minute or two of pleasure to be found in the duds Pochahontas, Hunchback and Tarzan was far too generous. Every moment here cheapens the previous one. This team just can't wait to show you their next un-original idea. (columns falling like dominoes, anyone?) This one has it all: obnoxious, post-Aladdin characters who appropriate a celebrity's entire persona (a la Robin-Williams: James Woods, Paul Schneider, Danny Devito, Bob Goldthwaite) instead of developing a character; this is lazy and irritating in the extreme. I can't tell you who did the voices in The Little Mermaid, because that movie had it's priorities straight. You also get crappy post-Elton John schmaltz like 'Go the Distance,' penned for those who enjoy easy listening a.m. radio, or maybe (I imagine) for figure skaters to have something schlocky to skate to. And a mediocre end-credits performance from some bad singer who apparently needed the exposure. I have no idea why Meg is interested in Hercules. He's very annoying. Other characters note how irritating he is, and he is... an earnest jackass who keeps screwing things up isn't much to look at. There is one terrific way to not be irritating, and that's to take the hint... and calm the hell down. This idea never occurs to Hercules (or his creators). The song 'I Won't Say I'm in Love' constitutes the films only non-irritating, pleasant moment. The movie is also the lame stab at a new aesthetic that Disney attempts every 5 movies. It just looks kind of flat and cheap. It's obsessed with spirals, notably in the depiction of nipples. So when the spiral appears obsessively all over the same character, they basically have nipple-ears, nipple-elbows, nipple-chins and nipple-pins fastening their tunics. It's weird. This movie reflects the continued lack of thought that would naturally follow the previous six or seven formulaic Disney flicks that people gave easy raves. So go ahead, and drink the Disney Kool-Aid. This time it's crap flavored.",1,11,37,20 March 2008
30 Days of Night," Just a way to pass the time
","The last 3 decades of vampire movies have usually needed to tap into something else in the culture to find relevance. Frank Langela's Dracula introduced a yuppie-stud vampire conceived to soothe female horniness, and cashed in on the play's success. The Lost Boys toyed with vampire gang violence. Copola/Stokers Dracula exploited blood fears and the HIV virus, Van Helsing tried an action movie makeover to tap into the success of the Mummy franchise (It failed). Almost everyone of the others use a recognizable 'drug addiction' arc... i.e. the vampires behave like junkies, as here.30 Days of Night takes one original overall gimmick (vampires above the Arctic Circle) and forgets to supplement it with other supporting ideas. It's structured hap-hazardly so the 30 days feel no different as a timeframe, than a movie that covers 4 days. I'm continually amazed that there are always funds available to make more vampire movies, since there's really only one vampire movie and they just keep making it over and over. Only the surface style changes. They haven't been scary in decades. (Are we even capable of being scared by movies anymore?) Here, the whole show is carnage. And it lazily borrows motifs introduced in Invasion of the Body Snatchers, the latest wave of zombie movies & Buffy. 30 Days of Night is sad evidence that surface activity reigns. As a culture we've become full time pushers of design and style to the degree that certain movie-goers are now merely design and style consumers; frontal lobes with legs and the cash for a ticket. Horror movies are designed, rather than thoughtfully conceived. Is there time to write a good script? Um, sorry no... we're waaaay too busy designing the credit sequence, and we have to pick out the right contact lenses and teeth for the vampires so they look rilly kewl! Then we have to overdesign the kills so they're kewl. And then we're on to the poster cause that has to look kewl. With tasks like those eating up brainpower, movies like '30 Days' never get around to content or depth.",3,2,6,5 April 2009
There Will Be Blood," The New Oldies
","In Europe they consider the novel a nineteenth century device, and they wonder why we Americans are still obsessed with the narrative format. The novel was displaced in the 20th century, by ideas, arguments and essays. But here we are in 2008 still noodling with stories. And in the absence of artists who know where to productively lead cinema, film-novels have been artificially raised to high importance, and film 'novelists' to similar esteem: Lars von Trier (after Dogme 95), Scorcese (lately) and with this movie Paul Thomas Anderson. Their approach holds very little appeal for me, as I have to sit through an hour or two of these completely obvious movies without any real ideas being put into play; without being asked to consider anything substantive.America is a culture which elevates individualism (for which stardom is the perfect emblem) to a freakish cult. I'm not one to gush over stars, and I don't agree that showy Method performances are the greatest thing in film today, but film aesthetes just love a grandiose, acting showcase. Here Daniel Day Lewis becomes the next to secure rave reviews by cranking up the Method machinery. The trick is getting old, but audiences, critics and industry people can't imagine what might dethrone it. Lewis as Daniel Plainview appears to be doing a showy impression of Walter Pidgeon for most of the movie. And because we're all familiar with Lewis from the big scorecard of great contemporary actors, we can compare how different the role is from the actor himself and say intelligent things like: 'Wow. Isn't Walter Pidgeon not at all like Daniel Day Lewis?' and conclude therefore that we must be watching a great performance. But in 20 years Daniel Day Lewis will have ceased being a going concern, and new audiences will be asking each other 'Why did people think this movie was important?' with puzzled looks on their faces. His performance will eventually have about as much meaning as Warner Baxter's performance in 'In Old Arizona' does today. Oh... you haven't seen that? He won the Oscar! Well how about George Bancroft in 'Thunderbolt.' Come on... you missed that one too? How can you talk about greatness when you've missed two of 1929's major contenders? They're this movies best context.'Blood' pads every shot with 60 percent dead air. There's no narrative reason to do so, or for this movie to be almost three hours long. If you had to summarize the story for someone waiting for you outside the theater, it might take you ten minutes... tops. It is without embellishment. It is the most arid, non-complex three hour movie ever made. Only the silence and the violence distinguish it from movies made in 1929. Sadly, 'obvious' is the new 'brilliant.'The startlingly amateur & miscast Paul Dano plays the second annoying role here. The two beatings he receives provide the films sole interesting moments. I'd gladly trade three hours of tasteful restraint masquerading as art, for twenty minutes of intelligence, passion or creativity. Again, the logic seems to be 'If it's three hours long, it must be art.' Just because a movie isn't over-produced doesn't mean it's not over-inflated. This is a sermon.",2,51,99,27 January 2008
Ice Age," aver Age (get it?)
","The first half an hour of this was so yawn-inducing, with cut-rate characters, and B grade ideas, that when the low-stakes conflict was introduced (returning a lost baby!?) I could not have been less interested. I turned it off with no interest in watching the rest. But then I needed something to fall asleep to later, so I put it back in.Yes, the movie had no hope of being better than a mediocre animated 'Three Men and a Baby.' But the quality improves a little. I laughed a few times ('Iceberg ahead, captain!'). And the sequence where Manny relives the demise of his family is touching, and subtly done in a style of animation based on cave paintings.The humans here are creepy, but then they're intended to be so. No one has ever provided an explanation on why the humans in Shrek are so damned stiff and disturbing.The DVD is designed so poorly that if you put it in your laptop it will insist that you view the games menu and not let you access the movie, even if you just want to watch it.",5,2,4,20 March 2008
The Bridge on the River Kwai," The dumbest David Lean epic
","I'm pretty tepid about David Lean's epics. Yes, they're some sort of cinematic development, but the best are a zero sum game (Laurence of Arabia) and others are just unfathomable (Zhivago, Passage to India, this). It's just not enough to go on location and get some pretty footage into a camera. Terence Malick has probably worn out a few copies of this.What to make of a movie where an hour is killed in a non-cinematic protest about using war prisoners as a workers, only to toss that hard-won development out the window so the movie can actually get rolling..? It's a twist so corny they don't even acknowledge it; and it doesn't result in any decent debate. Everyone here who has an opinion, just takes some half-understood, poorly-argued stance, for which the movie itself offers no supporting evidence. All I take away from it, is that the British are a bizarre race of people; more concerned about afternoon tea than figuring out a coherent moral viewpoint. William Holden's discomfort with the obtuse British is a proxy for my own. They might as well be aliens. Do we really need a British film to demonize the British? Isn't that Hollywood's fulltime job? The movie has already emasculated the soldiers, symbolically by the time it puts one of them in drag in it's hideously belabored last hour.Every conceivable piece of footage is tossed in to delay the end from arriving. When it finally does arrive ('Oh, give me a break!'), I was imagining about 20 more legitimate ways to structure a movie that needed to get to that big finale, which is the movies sole reason for being. Don't kid yourselves. There is nothing to think about in this movie. Structurally it's mush, making it excruciatingly tedious to sit through. I couldn't even be bothered to look up from my work every once in a while after hour two, to watch the exciting (snooze) mining of the bridge The DVD format is very odd. The movie eats up all its chapters in an hour and half, then it starts 22 more chapters on its own. Have mercy David Lean... or better still, have a point!I haven't outright hated a movie this much in a long time. This is a giant pile of B.S.",2,6,19,11 February 2008
A Hard Day's Night," A breath of fresh air
","I'm not so naive as to think that money, production and marketing aren't operative in the presentation of the Beatles, but the wonderful thing about this movie is its simplicity; the enjoyment comes from personalities and a good natured put-on, not an enormous budget or overwrought thrills. The boys are very good at delivering some unusually funny scripted nonsense. Here they're almost restructured as the Marx brothers and the transformation is a pleasure.This movie is the kind of reminder Hollywood needs every once in a while that CGI, explosions, forced thrills, luscious eye-popping color cinematography and conventional thinking are all markedly less interesting than simple dry wit and honest effort. It's the film equivalent of the White Stripes; stripping a format down to it's essentials and sounding like a revelation. Only the standard straight boy bugaboo (terror of an effete man - Here, a TV producer) is stale. It's here the movie begins to lose some steam. And Lennon, apparently lacking charm, is a too desperate for laughs and tries too hard.But even after all these years the movie feels fresh and unforced. You do not have to like the Beatles (I'm indifferent) to really enjoy this movie.It's a trifle, but it's fricking terrific.",8,2,3,31 December 2007
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Dra-kool-ya!
","Once upon a time Francis Ford Coppola bankrupted his studio (Zoetrope) introducing some interesting computer effects in a dud of a movie (One from the Heart); but for this pass on the defacto vampire story, he tired of those effects and instead pursued lurid, over-the-top artifice for its own sake. The sets and costumes are stagey and theatrical; and that's the better part of the endeavor. For about half an hour (near the beginning) the movie holds some promise, due to the excellent, strange, imaginative stuff you're being shown (Oldman plays the Count as an over the top empress dowager). But the movie suffers exactly where the Dracula story always does; Jonathan in Transylvania is interesting and eerie. But once the story moves back home to middle-class England, nothing can save it. Characters standing around drawing rooms, figuring out things every audience member already knows about vampires, is impossibly dull; in every single version of this tale.When it comes to mechanics (Oldman wheeled across a room, licking a razor, shadows performed by a second actor) Coppola is intriguing, but when it comes to effects, compositing, film technology, backwards sequences, editing and script it's all a bag of clichés. The story never deepens or concerns you. The characters never get past two-dimensionality. And all the Dutch angles in the world can't make an exhausted story interesting. The last hour is a seriously uninteresting, half-hearted slog.The Dracula tale is stale from over-repetition but somehow the movies still get bankrolled. What possible dramatic interest can be plumbed from newb-characters learning what a vampire is? Even with Coppola's gloss on Victorian sexuality and sex-borne pathogens it not interesting. The original Renfield from 1933 is still way creepier than Tom Waits decent effort. Scenes and ideas are lifted straight from other movies (Zentropa, Manhunter)",3,4,12,15 January 2010
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," I support the Will Ferrell backlash
","As I watched this very pointless, unfunny movie, my mouth was hanging open over how little Ferrell and I agree on what is funny. Ferrell can support a movie and get laughs in someone else's (Zoolander) but he ruins his own with his lazy, one-note shtick. Talladega Nights was stupid... Frank the Tank was stupid... Bewitched was stupid AND a trainwreck... Elf was mawkish Xmas leftovers... I can't even begin to describe how utterly free of laughs I found the previews for Blades of Glory and Semi-Pro. I enjoy a stupid comedy every now and then, but Ferrell's career is just dissembling into nonsense. Being a puerile character can be funny; making puerile movies is not.As Will Ferrell has no other stock to sell, we get his next self-impressed buffoon. There's nothing else in Ferrell's head. The movies big concept is that Anchormen never take off their anchorman jackets and never ease up on the sanctimonious speaking style. Isn't that funny? Shakes the Clown called - He'd like his idea back. When you're stealing fifteen year old concepts from Bob Goldwaithe you're in trouble. Any comedy I like eventually mocks sentimentality. Here and in Adam Sandler movies, sentiment is embraced as a way to provide a handful of utterly conventional plot-points. Get the girl. Win the fight. Do we really need any more carbon copies of that movie with new jokes? And I'm being generous when I describe this movie as having jokes or a plot. There is no reason to watch this for ninety minutes since each scene is just a disconnected, failed stab at being funny and providing lines for the Ferrell cult to parrot. The movie is utter nonsense by the twenty minute mark. After what seems like hours of failed improvised comedy, we get to a remarkable, unfunny Anchorman gangfight where an entire modern crop of unfunny actors have cameos (Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller) cause that's been original for, what, twenty years? What I would give for Vaughan, Stiller, Wilson, Ferrell, Rudd and the last ten years of their shitty, shitty movies to be erased from history. A final act with a sub-titled dog is supposed to be free-wheeling but it's just the most painfully insipid idea that should have been rejected in this mess. God, this movie is crap. It actually made me wince in pain.Ferrell has replaced Ben Stiller as Hollywoods resident 'irritating prick' presumably until the next desperate TV funny-man who's willing to do anything for a buck dethrones him. I feel very confident that the rest of Will Ferrell's career will be at least as stupid as what we've already seen. At this point, I would pay studios nine bucks NOT to watch each of the rest of his movies. I would prefer to have someone beat me with a pillowcase full of batteries for 2 hours, than sit through another miserably unfunny Ferrell vehicle. Kudos to Ferrell for figuring out how to parlay his extraordinarily limited talent into a paycheck, but I'm perfectly willing to sit down with him and discuss the terms of his immediate retirement. Paul Rudd used to be an actor before losing faith in himself and becoming the weakest, least funny member of both the Ferrell & Apatow meathead teams. He's the new Peter Lawford.The lowest form of comedy involves people trying too hard to be funny. Comedies which involve a self-impressed jackass (an anchorman, a nascar drive, a male model, a basketball player, a ping-pong champ, a dodge-ball captain, ad nauseum) taking himself too seriously are now officially DEAD!",2,6,12,29 February 2008
WALL·E," a crime against SUBTLE-T
","Having won the PR war, there is now no means by which a viewer can allow himself to judge a Pixar product as wanting or in this case, horrid. A movie so underscripted (and over messaged) that if you wasted five words describing the plot you'd give everything away. Audiences still don't know when they're being narratively cheated, or when a slightly promising idea has gone off the rails, or become a bloated, maddening mess. I never ever imagined when I rented this that I would be swearing at the screen as the unbearable latter two thirds of this movie wore out their welcome.So here we are (AGAIN) with the unpromising clichés of a robot who wants to feel love, a ships computer issuing a self-destruct countdown, a crowd that requires one person to save them.Wall-e himself makes sad eyes over and over. The movie milks this in every scene - Put 'robot' and 'love' into the big Hollywood script writing machine and you always get something like this. The movie becomes bloated with surface activity whose conception calls for dragging out tired computer animation, and the familiar set of unnecessary/lookalike obstacles to be overcome. It devolves into the usual thought (and time) wasters. In the end, things have reached the same frantic, overproduced excess that execs have been pushing for 50 years. Wall-E is exactly as bloated as Hello Dolly was in 1969. (& I challenge you to sit through that forgotten dud.)In the 1968 movie Oliver, at an emotional bottom, the title moppet sings a song called 'Where is love?' Lionel Bart was criticized for writing a song with sentiments too developed for a child to voice. While a child may seek the love a missing parent, they don't seek love in general as a disembodied ideal. Likewise for Wall-e. Here, barely three minutes after Wall-E is introduced, he's dreary little headcase pining for love, which is a limp idea dramatically for a kids film, and forces half the problems that ensue. The other half come from the wearying agenda, and this is coming from someone who is relieved we are finally in the green era.Vain, high-concept viewers have taken pride in their ignorance of a device here, which is old news; large stretches of silence are novel only to audiences who are unfamiliar with Jaques Tati, the 28 silent minutes that open 2001, enormous silent stretches of the ingenious Blow-Up (& countless other examples) and who can't fathom the silent era.The movie asks two tiny things of an audience; to nod in agreement with its simpleton moral pronouncements, and to pass the time distracted by a bunch of surface activity. Right in the middle, between those two things, is where any good movies soul resides, what the movie ask you to cogitate over; ideas! Sorry no ideas here, just an abundance of messages: Towers of garbage taller than the skyscrapers we built (check, message delivered) An indictment of bignesss and Wal-mart (check, message delivered) Headed by a craven CEO (check, message delivered) A single remaining plant (check, messaged delivered) A space-ark filled with helpless fatties (check, message delivered) etc. etc. etc. etc. (message delivered).A glimpse into the future has never been so hopelessly stuck in the narrative past, and never looked so much like Victorian corn. The movie just cannot rest until a parade of morals has been pounded home. There is little sense of wonder in it. It ain't surprising that it was directed by the guy who made Little Nemo.The movie becomes exactly as dreary, tiring and preachy as the premise of a largely wordless movie about ecology sounds. It does not overcome its major decisions. Regardless of it's popularity now, no one will be watching this in ten years because no one will be able to trudge through it. It is grotesquely unsubtle hideously preachy.Wall-E is is as insufferable as a dinner guest who explains the correct moral stance on every topic that comes up.

Prometheus," Incompetent as both story-telling and film-making
","Alien was a game changer when it came out. The reason you would want the director of that movie to resume after 30 years, is that he would being his extremely high standards to what has become a pretty bad franchise. Aggravatingly, all we see on every front (score, narrative, structure, imagination) is the lowest of low standards. Prometheus is not a game-changer. It's even worse than the lesser Alien movies, which makes it something like 'Attack of the Laser Squids from Planet Terror!!!'The two good entries in the Alien series did thoughtful things with the form (Alien, Aliens). The others had no idea what to do, so they just threw things at the screen (Alien 3, Alien Resurrection, AvP, Alien goes to the Suburbs). Having abandoned the high quality of his youth, Ridley Scott now embraces half-assed scripts like those later titles. Scott cashed in - all his effort for Prometheus went into becoming a showman; working the pre-release ballyhoo to generate a big payday. The short vids that were made to promote this suggested something unusual. Instead it's desperately 'usual.' It's his George Lucas self-destruct moment. This hackneyed dreck was not even worth filming. The title spaceship is not interesting. The threat here is not interesting. It has the most laughable aging make-up I've seen in 50 years. The characters are a complete slate of bellicose dopes. And the climax is the usual 'We don't have a climax so why don't we just film nine rotten clichés in a row?' I can't believe Scott thinks viewers waited 33 years for answers this feeble. Geiger's alien was elegant / thoughtful. For the first time, when a movie finally showed the alien, it was awesomely horrible and did not disappoint. Here we're back to stupid aliens from 1950s throwaway drive-in date movies. The alien gestation makes no sense anymore (as with Alien 3). A snake, apparently issuing from drops of black oil will attack you and kill you, and then you grow larger, gain superhuman powers and become aggressive (!) . If you ingest a drop of the black oil you will become the host of an alien that bursts out your head (!!!). If you make love to a human who is symptomatic, you will get knocked up with an alien squid. That alien squid will grow into a tentacled dumb thing that has nine mouths on the underside, which in turn gives birth to sharkhead (!!!!!). There is no reason to spend any more time describing the lousy, cut-rate path this horrible movie takes. Every answer it provides is a dumb one.Having no good ideas on where to take the series, Ridley Scott steals ideas from the X Files movie, Species, Splice, AVP and Contact. It's big idea, seen in countless movies since 2001, is now being thoroughly exhausted on the laughable TV show, Ancient Aliens. A father/daughter shocker is lifted straight from an Angela Lansbury movie from 1948 (State of the Union). The horny and dumb level of the proceedings is like watching 'Temptation Island' the gutter level reality show. And Laurence of Arabia is included for no reason whatsoever.Prometheus does not summon up the quality of Alien in any way. Instead it reminds a viewer mostly of two rotten pieces of low-grade schlock: Event Horizon (1997) and Super Nova (2000), movies that started by asking interesting questions, but then retreated into asinine developments, due to terrible writers looking for cop-outs. Prometheus deserves to be as little known as those two clunkers. The test of whether this is a worthy product to associate with Scott's original alien film, lies in asking the question: On its own, could this movie have ever generated as much buzz/response as the original? The answer is a resounding No. This rotten, rotten movie will influence nothing. Put Scott out to pasture where he can graze on his greenbacks. The best thing you can say about this irritating, stupid movie is that it will be gone from theaters in 3 weeks.",1,35,55,11 June 2012
Paths of Glory," Morality for simpletons
","The b&w cinematography for Paths of Glory is very crisp, reflecting Kubrick's background as a magazine photographer, but I wish I'd never watched this. I admire some other Kubrick movies, but this movie suggests that the simplicity one observes here and in all subsequent Kubrick films, might just be shallowness; as it is here.This script is dross, and hopelessly naff with its dumb sermon. The whole thing is overdetermined. What possible idea in it could a viewer disagree with? I felt like I was being led by the nose, because there isn't one syllable of ambiguity to be found in it; like a children's storybook. All you need is a morality detector with two settings, 'good person' and 'bad person.' George MacReady is over the top as a one-dimensional villain. One prisoner (Pierre) chews the scenery when offered a last drink; overacting at it's finest and pure hambone comedy. The extremely bad acting of the sobbing prisoner (Maurice) made my mouth hang open. The way his exit march is handled is utterly obtuse and unaffecting. Less important but odd, the attitude of the production has nothing in common with 1915. Never once does this feel like anything but 1957.The ending in which an entire room full of soldiers all have an epiphany at the exact same moment is dramatic rubbish. Show me a room full of fifty men who all have the same emotional response to anything, and I'll show you a corny dramatic lie. Everything in this movie (and I mean everything) is amateurish except the cinematography.",1,29,79,25 November 2009
The Queen," A bit simple
","This is a decent movie. Whether it deserves the raves it's getting is something else. It's adequate and in particular a sub-plot about the Queen's identification with a stag is nice, but... even the best movies today suffer from perfectly streamlined plots, uncomplicated by anything not directly related to plot; which indicates you're watching a simplified non-rich movie world. 'Plenty' or 'Scandal' which concern the upper crust in Britain, are richer, fuller experiences. I think even Caddyshack has more complexity (structurally) than most dramas these days. That's not good.I feel for the movie queen as acted and portrayed by Mirren, but when I think of the actual Queen I'm still cold. Even my sainted grandmother thought QE2 was a guttersnipe for her chilly reaction to DI's death. Tony Blair's big scene (his conversion) is not adequate; Frears barely bothers to set it up.The film seems to end, at which point a more conventional finish comes, which is a bit too pat and literal. The queen hints that Blair will have his painful moment in the spotlight in the future. Apparently Blair becoming Bush's lapdog and his ejection which will come later this year are what this unsubtle moment is pussyfoooting around.",5,3,4,11 February 2007
Raging Bull," What am I supposed to get out of watching a two dimensional stereotype?
","I've returned to Raging Bull a number of times over the last 30 years, but unlike other movies I've come to enjoy (after initially disliking them) I never find anything more in it than the meager merits found in the first viewing. I like many movies that Scorcese likes, but I find his own work pretty feeble and desperate.Raging Bull is structurally facile. It starts nowhere & goes nowhere. There is nothing for a viewer to discover, because Scorcese doesn't trust you to find it. He presents this movies symbol set overtly, so that none of that pesky 'searching' or individualized viewing is required. ('Ooh there's a religious image in the bg of the sex scene. I found the meaning!') Scorcese is either enamored of these brutes or repulsed, but either of those viewpoints offers slim pickings for a viewer. When all is said and done a movie needs to offer more than a catalog of scenes depicting and embroidering a stereotype. Movies can either deliver ideas or sensations. But viewers are now too ignorant to even figure out when ideas have been offered. Better to give them something showy; outbursts, near-constant violence, acting with a capital A, real human fat and 'pretty,' conspicuous camera work. These isolated conceits have become the traditional way of persuading lazy, inarticulate viewers they've seen a 'masterpiece!' There is nothing to pore over or to cogitate about when watching this movie. It accepts no meaning except that concerning violence.In the insect world, this movies equivalent would be to force bugs to watch people step on roaches for two hours. This movie is for thoughtless viewers who can think of no better purpose for a movie than delivering sensation. Raging Bull is barren.",2,7,25,14 May 2010
The Iron Giant," Much to admire
","This is a movie especially for boys. As a kid, it's just fine to have friends your own age, but younger kids know that hanging out with cooler, older teens is what you really want. The last thing my teen brother wanted was a kid pestering him. But I did have an older cousin who hung around with me one summer. That was a great summer. Here Dean McCoppin (Harry Connick Jr) is the human friend that hangs out with adolescent Hogarth, much as Connick did in Little Man Tate. Already that's a fine idea for a movie. As in other Brad Bird movies, the value of friendship is the whole show here. I'm completely open to that message. But bigger than any big brother, is the 100 foot tall Robot. Before there was Michael Bay's Transformers, there was this giant, retro, CGI robot. The giant is a simple soul who is perfectly sweet until hidden wires are tripped. The giant doesn't even learn why he does it, much as in human personalities. To say any more would be to crush this movies slight story.When I first saw this, I liked a lot of it but had some minor qualms about the ending. I really wish there was a moratorium on bombs launched in the final ten minutes of a movie (for the next 20 years). Fresh endings would then have to be devised. I really wanted this imaginative movie to also be as clever in it's major conflict and resolution as it had been everywhere else. I still like it, but it seems like the middle is lacking stronger scenes. As it turns out, scenes were cut from the film. I thought I'd never say this about a film, but it really craves a one minute montage showing some silly moments where the robot-Hogarth friendship intensifies.The smooth-moving CGI robot is inserted into more typical animation. Animators know that any object without a hard outline is difficult to animate conventionally, and so they take advantage of the CGI to make the giant's eyes two big hazy, expressive floodlights. All the voice talent provides good work, which results in the closest I've seen to acting in an animated movie. But even the largely silent giant has very nicely-observed behavior that contributes to his character. Disney's much more conventional attempts to get 2-D characters to act have been downright awful and d.o.a. (Hunchback, Pochahontas). The 'be whoever you want to be' message here, while a cliché, is such a soft-sell that a single word ('Superman...') at a pivotal moment, may make your eyes well up. It's really nice to see an animated movie that hasn't been overcapitalized and upsold like Disney's cynical 90-minute product launches; and one without their self-inflated need for instant classics; an urge that neuters any decision that might result in a unique or creative moment. This movie also spares audiences the obnoxious post-Genie hyperactivity and movie-ruining--freneticism that has made other Disney movies after Aladdin obnoxious and desperate (Hercules, Tarzan). I'm not a big fan of Bird's Disney work, though Monsters Inc (friendship again!) was very nice.I'm glad I re-rented this.",7,0,1,19 March 2008
The Emperor's New Groove," 'Why do we even have that lever?'
","I cannot stand typical Disney movies, and even if they could overcome their lazy, tiresome formulas, there would still be those insufferable stereotypes (Fat people are funny. Skinny people are treacherous. Attractive caucasoid people are virtuous. Ethnic or ugly people are villainous) which Disney distastefully falls back on over and over. The sentimental and schlocky Lion King which allowed them to tell a story about Africa without depicting a single black person was a massive cop-out. First animated black leading man character, Disney? Any time now (...would still be forty years too late)!'It's too sarcastic?' Take your impressionable and precious little treasures to some other lifeless movie then. But I'll take dozens of movies like this wild card from Disney before I'd ever sit through one of their safe, wholesome family clunkers again.It is so blessedly free of the Disney formula; no trio of wise-cracking sidekicks, no crappy song about longing for more, no villain (as such) who needs to be defeated in the last 5 minutes. No princess! There's (in other words) no decisions made by the same committee that choked the life out of their last ten movies. If you want that, just rent any other Disney movie. Kronk is a hoot, as is Eartha Kitt. The movie could use a better second act, but really that's a minor complaint after the endlessly schmaltzy, rotten sentiment of Pochahontas, Notre Dame, Hercules, Tarzan... all of which were simply crap.",8,0,2,26 May 2008
Blade Runner," Visionary but flat
","We waited eagerly for this movies release in 1982. It's a ravishing movie just as the preview indicated... but after watching it dozens of times now, it is also ...how best to say it... woefully unshaped. The script is completely unremarkable. It has perfectly flat, uninteresting characters who are handed inept or trifling exchanges. I don't know what you could even characterize as a climax or even a development (and I like me some dull movies). The movie traipses into editorializing 'Who's the greater danger?' territory with the replicants not being especially evil by comparison. You don't see them gunning down a terrified woman in the streets like Deckard does. But really, any clarity or philosophical weight that a fan insists is in there, is projected into it by the viewer. It does equal or (can you believe it?) surpass some of the very best old, noir compositions; but we do see that giant billboard one or two times too many. Ignore the bare-bones story. Turn the volume off and enjoy the visuals.Ridley Scott had no peer in the visualizing department in 1982, then he went on to less visual, more 'shaped' output after this (Thelma and Louise, Blackhawk Down... Robin Hood?) and it was easy to see why he should have stayed with the more visual productions. They were more remarkable.",2,13,28,31 May 2010
Casino Royale," inaction movie
","The new Bond movie has so much PR to do to convince you Daniel Craig IS the new Bond that it neglects (as cooing critics have) other aspects of the story. Watching people sit around playing cards is less interesting than seeing a Bond, any Bond, in action. A villain who cries blood is not interesting. Craig is great in spite of only being required to sit around playing cards, or in the films ridiculous conclusion sitting around in a wheel chair. The credit sequence here is pretty silly; a literalization of the icons of a deck of cards that kill.A scene involving a threat to the villains girlfriend seems to be lifted from Altman's The Long Gooodbye.But really, if Bond is going to care about someone, write the character well, and cast someone who has a broader range that this self-impressed 2-dimensional British cream pie (played by a very baaaaaad actress). Vesper Lynd s*cks. She is profoundly non-compelling. She didn't register a positive twitch in my ganglia, but somehow Bond is ga-ga and moves into caring-protector mode. She's the worst part of the movie.At least I could sit through this one; some thing I haven't been able to do for about 2 atrocious decades of Bond films. And super-pinhead Denise Richards is relievedly nowhere in sight. It's amazing that this entire phenom did not result in an ounce of exposure for the previous satire version of C.R..",4,3,5,22 January 2007
La Vie En Rose," check it out
","I am familiar with Piaf through two or three songs, and by reputation but had no idea her life was so horrible and short. This movie does a great job of moving viewers from a place of really not liking Piaf because of some hideous character flaws (she's a self-indulgent, low class guttersnipe) to a place where you warm up to her despite her shrewishness.I don't agree with two of the biggest complaints (too long, too bleak). I felt the movie does a good job of preventing a multitude of depressing incidents from becoming too hopeless for viewers (compare the similarly themed, but hideously depressing Angelas Ashes.); and that I never noticed the length. Amidst the depressing events there are some nice moments with a devoted lover, an interviewer, etc, that are more affirming and pleasant than the last twenty films I've seen. Piaf's performance of le Marseilles, when forced to perform by her father, is really impressive.Some nice directorial touches here and there: rather than show us the performance where she wins over a crucial audience, he blanks the sounds and lets us watch her perform visually. This movie does a better job than most of reviving a previous period in history. And the jumps between actresses who play Piaf are unusually good.Cotillard inhabits the role. I thought there were even more actresses portraying Piaf, because the aging makeup is so convincing.",7,1,2,22 November 2007
Bull Durham," sports haiku
","Bull Durham was a really good movie when it came out. But I watched it recently and portions of it are not aging well. There is tension over whether the movie is going to be thoughtful, or whether it's going to be a marketable 'product.' The 'valentine to baseball' moments are writ large (unsubtle!) and Shelton could have left them out because they're just gilding the lily; the movie is already a valentine to baseball. Annie Savoy's outfits are obnoxious in a way the movie is not. Shelton also takes a lot of this from Slapshot. And I think it was Christopher Null who griped that Crash's big famous speech to Annie about his beliefs being overwritten. (It is.) The Bulls team is largely made up of dopes whom thoughtful people would now regard as 'meatheads,' but how can you give it low marks for all of that, when there's such smartness elsewhere?The movie's charm lies in in wry moments that are written subtly enough to please any smarty. It deserves credit for suggesting that small towners might be aware of William Blake, Kirkegard, Thoreau, alternative sexuality, etc. Even if it's a complete fiction, it's a nice place to occupy for a few hours. And really what makes parts of the film extraordinary is its oblique answer to philosophy, media coverage (intentionally being boring as the highest art of public relations), and movie plot lines. When's the last time you were asked to (allowed to?) identify with the second best character in a Hollywood movie? How often does a sports movie have the nerve to work in a love of books? There is a thread of laconic sensitivity here encompassing futile achievements and humility, that could not be manufactured by a hundred baseball-loving Hollywood execs. 'Full many a flower is born to blush unseen, And waste its sweetness on the desert air.' Thomas Gray, or was it William Blake? You can look it up!Also... I loathe sports. It doesn't matter one bit. Parts of this movie are quite nice.",7,3,7,29 April 2009
Identity," cheap gimmick
","I am not the ideal audience for a movie like this. I've grown very tired of movies written backwards from the big reversal-ending and this is one of the very limpest. The only one I think was any good was 'The Others,' whose surprise ending didn't cheapen every frame of the movie that came before it. I am not a fan of John Cusack, whose appeal escapes me. But I was intrigued that he would take a role like this in a movie like this. But it's really only interesting enough to be a short TV movie. Hopefully this movie is the caboose on the surprise-ending movie train. I don't hate it, I just don't think it's worth your time. I don't think it's a sleeper that will gain in reputation. It'll just be forgotten.",3,3,7,17 June 2006
Amélie," Clever & touching.
","This movie is an embarrassment of riches, but could easily have been thirty minutes shorter. A story about a person doing good for the people around her with elements of fantasy and a love story at its center. This manipulations of Amelie are reminiscent of Hitchcocks 'Rear Window' although it's teeming with originality too. It's a mix of pleasant & ingratiating ideas. The pleasant ones are the reason to see it. The ingratiating ones border on the twee and sophomoric. I could have found half an hour to delete. For 'pleasant' it's a very hard sell. At a certain point you feel like Jeunet would strangle you if it made you like him more. I admire this movie more than I enjoy it. The cat and mouse things is a bit precious and goes on a bit too long. And I've never understood how if Matthieu is stroking Tatou's cheek in the funhouse, how can he not know it's her at Les deux Mouls? Her haircut is kind of distinctive from front or behind. It's miles beyond what Jeunet and Caro did in 'Delicatessan' and 'City of Lost Children.' Two overwrought movies that are too clever for their own good and rapidly wear out their welcome. This is more directed. Some familiar elements from the other movies are mixed in with fresh ingredients here: Contrived cause and effect, special effects, eccentric camera work, twins, and innocent children. A commentary track by Jeunet is very nice. But it's a mystery why the special edition requires two dvds. There ain't much on it.The frizzy-haired gal behind the counter was Jean-Pierre Leauds hotty mother in the 400 Blows.",7,1,3,17 December 2001
300," When nipples attack!
","Ugh. Where to begin with this pile-up? It occupies some truly weird place where homoerotic tough-guy worshiping meets up with right wing, pro-male, pro-war machismo. Here it is: someone's most delirious homo-erotic dream AND a hetero guys most brainless, macho fantasy. I'll let you tell me what that means for the culture. I'm baffled. This movie was offensive to me from the first few minutes. If you missed the offenses, you're pretty dumb.Somehow, it takes a crowd of hetero guys to come up with a movie this gay (and this anti-gay!!!). Top Gun was the previous upper limit for heterosexual homoeroticism. A homosexual would have probably reached their fill before devising a half-naked villain in a speedo who wears eyeliner... probably way before our butch, half-naked hero throws a pole at him and hits him in the mouth (Mmmmm, very subtle...). And to turn the Spartan army which in reality was an ARMY OF LOVERS, into an army of homophobes. Uh yeah, OK, whatever.I made it through very little of this junky, stupid movie. At about the 2 minute mark, the painfully dumb narration turns out to be issuing from the mouth of a drippy character who announces that Sparta has to go to war with the Persians because the Persians 'don't believe in reason!' Uh huh... sure. You go to war to defend reason. Yeah. That sounds terrific. Oddly Sparta doesn't strike me as a place where anyone has ever picked up a book, or debated anything past their initial caveman grunts. 'Reason' never even makes a token appearance. How's that for perfunctory plot motivation?By the 7 minute mark I was already thoroughly tired of the stupid script, the stupid delivery style (every line is shouted as a rallying cry) and the anti-gay provocation. Every line is a fresh piece of horsesh*t pseudo-poetry that gets shouted. Even the passing of gas would be announced by one of these hard-ons shouting: 'I JUST FAHRRT-TED!!!!' If you shout every line, it must be profound and passionate right? ...or absolutely, profoundly stupid. Every frame is pretty, but it's as shallow as a movie can be, making it a worthy successor to the very vapid Sin City. The silly production design seems to cause all the remaining nonsense I could bear to fast-forward through. If you're going to war, would you only wear a speedo? If you go to Sparta to announce that Spartans are your new scapegoat, do you stand a foot away from the decorative hole to infinity at the center of town?Frank Miller & Gerard Butler are on my boycott list after this homophobic crap. Would anyone make a movie today in which we root for an army that vilifies black people? Why do these schmoes get a pass on this deeply objectionable movie? Butler is a Neanderthal. Good luck pulling your career out of the hole it's in Gerard. You might consider whether the scripts you accept reflect current values or those of fifty years ago. How many anti-straight-boy movies could these fan-boys put up with? Let me tell you, when Hollywood eventually starts making them, they'll be long overdue.The ideal audience for this may be heterosexuals mourning the lost 'culture of virility' with man-boys pining for a time when they weren't towing the line of women cutting them off from sex to get their way.",1,27,45,10 September 2007
The Thin Red Line," How to turn war into porn.
","Before it devolves into a remake of Platoon, this movie seems to be going some place interesting. Unlike Spielberg, Malick did find a new way to make a war movie. But Malick's insistent prettiness becomes very distracting, and inappropriate ...and irritating ...and intrusive ...and soporific. Each new gorgeous cutaway makes you mindful that all this self-conscious 'art' is being laid on a few feet thick. You could invent a Terence Malick drinking game to underscore all of his formulaic tics. He seems to constantly be thinking 'We can use that really nice (mist shot, tree shot, light filtered through leaves shot, owl shot, lizard shot, bat shot) here. He's not committed to developing an idea about war, or to getting back to the story. He is however very committed to the idea that a viewer cannot go 20 seconds without seeing something pretty.Two-thirds of what he includes would have been scrapped by a less indulgent director. At one point he starts a skirmish in a dusky, misty wood and a minute later it's sunny and there isn't a tree in sight; best not to waste all that pretty footage he shot. It reaches a point where Malick's own effort at being deep is instead undermined by his visual superficiality. Is everything in the world, no matter how ugly, to be distanced from actual experience by pretty photography? to be converted into a pretty picture? When you make everything so ravishing that a viewer can't look away, you may have made porn.I don't mind that it corrects the outdated 50s conventions for war movies (as in South Pacific) where there's a single casualty and there's nothing but time to be cheerful & sing. And after watching the dull & flat Tora Tora Tora just before this, I was delighted to see shots not as brightly lit as a suburban living room. But at absolutely no point does this feel like the 1940s. I had to continually remind myself that this wasn't Viet Nam, because it's distractingly filtered through a revisionist post-Nam viewpoint. Just as in 'Tora Tora Tora' where it seems like no one under 50 was at Pearl Harbor, here only southerners fought WW2. All dialog more than three lines is given to one of innumerable Baptist-raised, home-schooled savants from the deep south who's two words away from some honest deep truth, or some bittersweet, Faulkneresque musing, usually both. I wonder what Malick would do if he was forbidden to fallback on a narrator drawling over a bunch of pseudo-poetic musings. As Carlos Cavagna has noted: 'he feels the need to elaborate with voiceovers. Malick is unable to show you what he's trying to convey, so he must tell you.' Forget anything resembling high spirits or individualism, these troops have been thoroughly screened so as to compile a full platoon of lost, alienated, anomie-fueled ruminators.Malick loses the throughline often and the last hour is mush. The 'love-making' scenes that carry one soldier forward are absurd; like something out of a romance novel or a perfume commercial, not the grubby, efficient screwing that's more likely part of the life of some back woods southern boy.Is it a better movie than I could make? Profoundly so. Is it better than Hollywood can make? Emphatically. Is it better than Malick can make? Unfortunately, no. This is a film-maker who is fussily pulling strings to get you to declare him a genius, not someone making art.",4,1,2,4 November 2007
Sin City," puts the 'duh' in dumb.
","I hated this movie. I had no choice in watching it. A friend brought it over. Never let a friend select the DVD for movie night.This is thoroughly immature masturbation for juvenile-minded males who want to retreat to a comic world populated by tough guys, slutty girls and stoopit violence, as if their actual transformation of the world into those things is taking too long. They exclim in superlatives over it's arty pretensions, without being able to describe a single idea; the definition of 'poseur.' It doesn't surprise me that this is from Frank Miller. He seems to have a career goal of making 'cool-looking' movies that peg Hollywood someplace even shallower than video games. American entertainment continues to allow man-boys to retain adolescent interests well into late-adulthood, which is just sad.But hey, finally a role Mickey Rourke can play with his prissy, ruined meatface; a testosterone-driven freak with a visage seemingly made out of lumber. Michael Jackson is his only equal in terms of ill-conceived, recreational plastic surgery.",1,10,24,10 April 2007
The Cabin in the Woods," A 4 star Groaner
","This got such uniform good reviews, I knew I had to see it fast, before the buzz turned it into an over-hyped beast. No such luck. It IS an over-hyped beast. I should have known better. All the reviews I skimmed suggested a boffo trick ending or reveal... and I hate those movies. The script is not clever. If I had walked out as I was inclined in the middle of the tiresome set-up, I'd have missed nothing.The plot of this stinker involves slowly disclosing several nested narrative devices, and invokes higher and higher scales of society, until you know the ending will just HAVE to be the piece of full-scale idiocy that they came up with. But the writers offer not not a peep of explanation for why the sacrifice has to take the form of a clichéd, glacially slow, horror movie; which makes the movie convoluted, and the entire premise quite costly. Couldn't you just kill the 5 types in their homes, or better still in a way that introduce a new type of horror movie? But no, the writers paint themselves into a corner, thinking (as TV talent does) that sensation is even better than thought, and will save this overextended premise in the end. There has never been a movie that builds to a CGI monster that is worth a damn. The movie got some kudos for its references to previous movies (The Shining, Alien 3, The Ring), but it's also so dumb it just lazily rips most of them off: The Truman Show, And then there were None, Army of Darkness, Halloween 3, Cube, 13 ghosts, Rosemary's Baby, Hellraiser, etc. No matter how you mash 20 old movies together, it will not produce 'new.The movie poster (a house exterior turned into a rubik's cube) rips off the poster for Deathtrap; another bit of drivel - with a terrible, terrible twist ending - that received scads of undeserved rave reviews. If you've exhausted yourself today sitting at home watching vapid TV, and you need a break, Cabin in the Woods will take your tired thoughtless mind even dumber places. But there is zero purpose in seeing it. This movie will be forgotten in 5 years (see also: Identity).",1,21,41,22 April 2012
Contact," compelling misfire
","The movie has a structure that is very satisfying to keep up with. Where most movies have one, or at the very most two, intriguing developments, this one has nine or ten, that arrive with great regularity. Zemeckis' camera work and tricks (Look again...) are nice and serve the story well. There are scenes in it that make my hair stand on end. I wish after the astonishing trip in the machine that we didn't spend 2 hours getting across the universe, to get a saccharine, anti-climactic homily from dad. And the stupid preachy final scene with religious MacConaghey coming out on top is grating. Someone should have told them 'You don't have an ending.' Unfortunately narrative elements & characters necessary to set up a bunch of bad guys, bog down additional viewings. The movie just has too many a-holes; Tom Skerritt, James Woods, Angela Bassett, Junior Busey, Rob Lowe; I wish this crowd of antagonists wasn't here, because the movie could be so much more than the usual pissing match with some villainous jerk(s). You can't investigate metaphysical beauty while mired in earth-bound pettiness. Would you watch 2001 and decide, 'Boy, could this use a love interest, and a bad scientist!'? Contact quickly becomes burdened with the tiresome religion vs. science debate. Wouldn't the movies be a nice place to be free from the views of the corrupt, immoral religious right?The intertextual casting of Jody Foster as the mannish Ellie Arroway plays uncomfortably off the allegations that she's a lesbian. (i.e. the campy scene where she tells Mattthew McConaghey to leave his number) I'm not hating, my closest friend is a lesbian - but the mating subplot is bizarre to watch. Has anyone ever looked less comfortable with a member of the opposite sex? It makes you think her strategy of choosing leading-man-less, love-less scripts (Panic Room, Flightplan, The Accused, The Brave One, Anna and the King, Nell, Little Man Tate) is the right choice for her. On the other hand, Foster sells the trip with her acting skills.The final straw is the asinine Matthew MacConaghey, in the role of an asinine, babbling, douche-bag/nu-age priest. I cannot bear to watch even a few seconds of this idiot in any movie. No matter what he's trying to portray, what shines through is 'd-u-m-b.' If you dreamt up the complex (ahem...) role of a sexually-active religious figure who is the heroine's antagonist/lover, would you get MacConaghey to play it? The man can barely move his lips correctly to form words. The rest of the movie teems with so much liberal earnestness that this viewer, liberal also, wanted to retch. Every time I watch it, I want to strangle the (over)actor who plays the blind nerd every time he speaks.All of this is unfortunate, because the movie successfully treats science as a wondrous, methodical discipline. I can't name a single other movie that does that.",5,4,9,26 November 2007
The Bourne Supremacy," OH Baby... OH baby... then it fell apart! ...fell apart!
","I rented this to flesh out the trilogy for me. I missed the middle one. I'm not a fan of action movies but I'm running out of stuff to rent.I really did not enjoy this movie. I found it so dull that I dozed off twice; once in the middle of the last action sequence! I guess I'm not the target audience for this. I do require that a movie put some ideas in play for me to get engaged. This movie had none. It just drags you between action setpieces with middling pursuit/intrigue dialog. As I watched I kept thinking, wasn't this scene in the first one? the second one? The first one had a decent car chase. The third one had that great sequence in the train station. This one just seemed like unimaginative filler. Unusually dullWhoever invented the 'nervous camera' technique should have a shaky wide lens camera jammed up their butt.",2,1,3,21 November 2007
The Simpsons Movie," Funny but lacking
","It's funny enough. I sat in the theater smiling or laughing like everyone at the situations and inside jokes.But the problem is exactly what could be anticipated: It provides no reason for the jump in medium; failing to answer what in the movie couldn't be done on TV? You keep waiting for the movie to exploit some cinematic angle but it never ever gets around to it, not in any major way. How can it be that the marketing gag of turning 7-11s into Quikee-Marts is a more clever and memorable concept than the idea for the movie? The end credits are a microcosm of the problem: They start one way, then... they're interrupted by a Monty Burns gag. You wait for the next cameo and it doesn't arrive. Instead... a row of theater chairs appear and the Simpsons start mocking the credits from them. Sounds promising, right? But then that idea is abandoned in barely a minute, before it even gets started. Then the credits just run normally. This is a movie designed by committee.In a very poor move, Monty Burns plays no part in the plot. And look at that title! 'The Simpsons Movie' (!) The movies hum-drum goals are exactly embodied by that disappointing, run-of-the-mill title.",5,16,27,28 July 2007
All the President's Men," Momentous Disclosures / Soon to be undermined by Gerald Ford
","Some people choose this as their favorite movie ever made, and while it's about something very important, it's a little too self-important. It's topic and theme are rousing. But it's two and a quarter hour running time suggests too much self-regard. It has nothing going for it in terms of filmic ideas. It's just a narrative. It kind of toys with some tension-building cross-cuts borrowed from The Manchurian Candidate; political progress is being made by the incorrigible as the truth is ferreted out. But the movie really fails to convey the exciting, outraged hub-bub of scandalized American population watching the trickle of these developments. Viewers who admire this prefer clear moral lines, and are pleased by journalists portrayed as knights in shining armor. But we've seen despicable journalists using the media for evil only too recently. It was a short trip from The Pentagon Papers to Judith Miller, Robert Novak, Fox News; and other sub-human individuals willing to foist partisan PR on the nation, as a smoke screen to advance personal causes.Almost 4 decades of GOP underhandedness began here with Karl Rove waiting in the wings. And Ford's complicity and inability to recognize the crimes, created an urge in the GOP to do it all over again, only at a more grotesque scale, which was realized with the Bush/Cheney Whitehouse.",6,3,7,2 May 2009
The Wizard of Oz," The value of Oz is a no-brainer
","Some of the criteria here that people use to rip this movie are a hoot. i.e. 'It's not realistic.' (! well... it IS a child's fantasy) 'They changed the book' is an argument rooted in the deeply absurd idea that movies are best when they strictly adhere to decisions made for the benefit of a completely different media. Come to think of it the book didn't have songs in it... Admittedly the films weird cult (as in Christianity) creates the biggest barrier to getting anything from the object of devotion.While the decision to write off the land of Oz as a dream is a creative writing teachers nightmare, it probably saved the culture from fifty years of garbage sequels that would have sullied this film. That the book was 'changed' is a strange complaint, because the larger point of contention is that they only filmed 3/4ths of it. The last portion of the book is completely missing. (the quadlings, the dainty china country, green glasses) The exclusion of these bits without their being missed, is indicative of how arbitrary Baums inclusions are. Most of the altered elements are technically motivated. How do you have a swarm of field mice carry a lion out a poppy field in 1939? The slippers were changed to the more vibrant red color because the original silver slippers offered nothing that couldn't have been shown in the black and white world Dorothy has left. etc.As it is, it offers an abundance for a child to digest and the inclusion of the missing elements would have compressed the rest and perhaps triggered exhaustion in the audience. My patience grows thin at the 'If I were King' interlude and the movie mercifully omits the late developments. Any book would do well to have such a hack job done on it. Baums simplistic, chirpy books might be out of print by now if not for this movie. Furthermore Baum restlessly throws away populations and characters over the course of each book before they're even developed. There's a spoof of Baum's books just waiting to be written, called 'The United Nations of Oz,' in which Oz diplomacy is explained to suggest how all these nations, regions & peoples get along... it might be useful in our world.You could complain about what it doesn't achieve but the movie is so packed with iconographic elements (the yellow brick road, munchkins, witches, malevolent trees) all entering the tableaux in breathless maximization (the way children prefer their stimulation) that the movie becomes powerfully vivid. The window has probably closed on the era in which you could intentionally produce a movie that plays as this does on the naivete and complexity of the American psyche.My only complaint about this is that it is perfectly scaled to the venue which popularized it (TV). On the big screen the tiresome use of vaudeville shtick & cop-outs cheapens and trivializes plot points and grates on a viewer. Next time you watch it, try cataloging which gender holds all the power in the movie. Margaret Hamilton terrifies kids, and her witch is iconographic. Can anyone show me a green witch before 1939? Some goofy lines are hysterically inappropriate seventy years later (only bad witches are ugly... toto too!) There's a moment as the Munchkins entreat her to 'Follow the Yellow Brick Road' where Dorothy's rhythmic walk transforms into her happy dance-skip. It's a wonderful moment that for it's triviality shouldn't be as joyful and touching as it is. Dorothy's unacknowledged kiss from Glinda is also sweet.",7,1,5,1 May 2005
From Here to Eternity," From Start to Infinty
","This movie does such a poor job of setting up its timeframe (It was made in '56.) that I thought it was taking place during the war, and I kept waiting for the 'We're shipping out' storyline to kick in. I kept thinking, 'some war movie... Where's the war?' Maybe there was a title that fixed the date, and I missed it. Maybe the book was so well known they thought a title card wasn't needed. Eventually, I thought the story must only be about the routine goings-on at a peacetime barracks. You can't blame me. Nobody ever mentions the war (!) and there really isn't much going on in the movie. Then at the last minute, the Japanese attack. Would you make a 2-plus hour movie that included Pearl Harbor and toss it away as a 4 minute sequence? The concerns of three soldiers and two whores whose fates are torn asunder by the war are small potatoes; the very smallest way to tell a story about WW2. Foregrounding these trivial stories and pushing Pearl Harbor to the rear is positively bizarre. Lancaster is good, as is Clift, but every one of the plentiful 'funny drunk' scenes in this is cringe-inducing and heinously acted. If you're going to be deep about about emotions, why not film the actual effects of alcoholism, instead of pretending drunks are charming? Ditto for annoying scenes of white people trying on black culture (blues music) in a bid for authenticity - just embarrassing. They Were Expendable also features a cringe-inducing, half-assed blues tune. The story lines are trifling and not blended well. As Clift gets gunned down near the end, I'm asking, 'that's your big ending? Deborah Kerr's 'bad girl' is about as ridiculous as Tom Hanks bad guy (Road to Perdition)... you know a plot-point that excuses everything will be forthcoming, so a hopelessly wholesome actor can save face. Donna Reed as a hooker is another absurdity. Sinatra got an Oscar for playing this flimsy goof?",4,10,31,28 October 2007
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Hee-Haw for film snobs
","It's possible to make a smart movie about yokels. It's much more common to make a movie about Yokels that traffics in stupid yokel humor. Sadly, this is the latter. The Coen brothers have a very sophisticated understanding of American regionalism; which they blend with their unrefined, idiotic sense of humor to make some very awful movies. There comes a point in this movie when a viewer cuts his losses, as the scales tip from enthralling regionalism, to repellent juvenile low-humor; which probably wasn't even funny when it last appeared (vaudeville?). There isn't a gag in the Coen canon that rises above cornball. How they've managed to parlay this into a respectable career is confounding. Only the blue-grass and gospel songs save this turkey from being totally dead in the water. At the 30 minute mark, all the energy has wheezed out of it, forward momentum has completely expired, and you're left with over an hour with no perceptible value whatever.O bother...",1,17,43,24 July 2010
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," bottom of the barrel
","I can't believe I actually made it through more than 4 minutes of this. It's exhausting to even think of the phony enthusiasm the crew must have had to fake to finish this movie. If anyone ever tried you to convince you that America is not in a state of freefall, your trump argument would be to drop the title of this movie into the conversation. The other party would just have to go silent in agreement.I am not a fan of Will Ferrell. I wouldn't see another movie with him in it if he stapled one hundred dollar bills to his naked body and shoved a roman candle up his ***; which can't be too far off. What on earth is John C Reilley doing in this?Here are ten things I'd rather do than watch a Will Farell movie: Let's start with the easy one: I would rather eat horse feces.
