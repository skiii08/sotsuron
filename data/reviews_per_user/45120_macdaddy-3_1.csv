Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," George, we all know you can do better
","I'll put it short and sweet, the latter of which is the main problem of Phantom Menace:  Shut up.  If I was there during the making of the film, that's all I would have been thinking.  Shut up, shut up, how can I just shut up?  I believe a strong sense of balance is needed in films, and while expositionary scenes and eye candy are completely tolerated by film-goers, they occur far too often in Phantom Menace, resulting in myself not caring for the main characters, save what I had already felt in episodes IV, V, and VI. I love you George, we all do, but all I, and millions of other fans, are asking is that in the next film, which I will see in a heartbeat, trust the actors.  Trust the hundreds of facial muscles.  Trust me, you'll push us over the edge.",5,0,1,20 May 1999
