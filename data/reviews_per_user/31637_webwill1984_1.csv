Hereditary," Zzzzzz....
","I went to see this turd because of all the critic hype. FOOLED AGAIN !! Lots of long takes with silence, which critics apparently LOOOVE ('Why, it looks and smells like...art!') Boredom does NOT equal dread. Expect loads of it. I had to move my seat because there was a dude behind me snoring so loudly. And what makes for 'good acting', a lot of fake crying and hysterics? Ugh. Toni Collette was never so annoying. (There, I said it.) The only real interesting part of the movie was when she admitted she hated her son. (Toni's good here.) But it's the one good scene. And Gabriel Byrne has never been so aloof. I suspect his part was trimmed down because there's a hint that his character suspects his wife is crazy, but he was directed or edited to just shrug through the movie. And his demise was so telegraphed that I thought it would be at least graphically stunning when it happens, but, meh, the dude continued snoring in the back. Furthermore, the audience was so bored that they started clicking their tongues throughout the movie to amuse themselves. (A movie in-joke.) And at the end, laughter and hissing. This roll-your-eyes fest reminded me of THE WITCH, another epic waste of time. Life lesson: Never see a movie only because critics rave about it.",1,42,88,11 June 2018
