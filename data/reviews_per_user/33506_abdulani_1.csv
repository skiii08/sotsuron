Captain Phillips," perfect 10
","watched it yesterday with my 3 kids, my 9 yr old son told me 'its the best movie ever mama' and my 10 yr old girl wants to watch it again and suggesting to bring her grandparents together:-).....whereas my eldest girl age 12 said its depressing (hahahhahah) especially when its at the end of the movie slot.....but one thing for sure TOM HANKS made that character so real that I felt how it is to be Captain Philips and I cried at the end of the movie too, very emotional and I know thats exactly how you reacted when u experienced traumas....LOVE YOU TOM HANKS...YOU ARE THE BEST ACTOR AND ALWAYS MY FAVOURITE ....he definitely did so excellent in bringing up his character that he makes the movie real and even though the movie time is more than 2hrs there was no issue of boredom with my kids and we enjoyed every minute of it especially my youngest son...as what he said described it perfectly 'best movie ever mama', its a great family entertainment overall.",10,0,3,10 December 2013
