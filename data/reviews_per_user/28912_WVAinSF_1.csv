Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A blah addition to the Star Wars series
","I found this movie driven by the Star Wars marketing machine. Star Wars began as a comic book for adults. Over the years, as the younger set joined the following, the script writers realized that the youth franchise should be the focus. How else can you explain the presence of JarJar Binks? I can hear it now ('we need a hip, funny character the kids can identify with'). Big Mistake.The result is a movie that lacks the roller coaster ride the first trilogy delivered. Special effects were used without contributing to the story (e.g., 'Gee whiz, another big fish'), and JarJar helps save the day (and lose the hearts and minds of everyone over 10)",Null,0,1,3 August 1999
