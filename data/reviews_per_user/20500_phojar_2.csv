10 Cloverfield Lane," First half great / ending very disappointing
","I wish I could rate the first hour of this movie separate from the last 20 minutes. I was really into this movie wondering if outside really was dangerous, if the other guy was in on it, and many more questions. Great acting and lots of uncertainty and mystery. ---------**spoilers**When she got out of the bunker and the aliens attacked. Really? The entire movie was NOT about aliens - then you had to go and make it bat poop crazy. I like a drama that REALLY COULD HAPPEN. And up until that point all of it could have happened. Here is the alternate ending I wish I could have had: She got out of the bunker, realized there was no danger in the air, ran to the road and got to a police station. They figure out the reality of how crazy this man is and even come up with a few more missing people (maybe even his ex- wife). Then they go to arrest him and he is not there. Enter part 2 or end the movie with him in a new town talking to a young woman or looking to hire someone to help him build a new bunker (with a war story about the new scars on his face from the acid).",3,2,4,19 February 2017
Hereditary," Stories with no answer
","I hated this movie, the acting was pretty good and the filmography was good so it gets a 2.The entire movie you have no idea where anything good together and then I'm the last 5 minutes they try to reveal this huge plot that fell very short. The scene with three accident was the best part, filmed well and brought a lot of emotion. But there were just so many pieces that never had any explaination.
-why did the Grandma breast feed the son
-what was the note in the book at the beginning
-what was the words written on the walls
-who put the body in the Attic
-why did the mom cut her head off
-what exactly is the cult plan for not having Peter go to prison
The questions just never end because it was like they just said 'yeah that's creepy let's add that in' with no reason.",2,3,8,30 December 2019
