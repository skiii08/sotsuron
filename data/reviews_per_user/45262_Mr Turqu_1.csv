Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not that bad
","I admit was being generous when I gave 10 out of 10 for 'The Menace', but I know it deserves more than the 7.2 average that it currently has. Granted, the Podrace sequence was un-necessary, and much too long anyway, and yes, I am firmly behind the 'Rip out Jar-Jar's tongue campaign' but it didn't deserve all the slamming that it got. It was over hyped. It was only a film. But, in my opinion, a good film. And Darth Maul ruled! And Anakin sucked!",10,0,0,4 September 1999
