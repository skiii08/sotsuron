Blade Runner 2049," Three very long hours of dragging scenes filled with blood, bombs, knives and chest-booming noise.
","I gave this a 1 because there isn't a 'minus' option.I went last night to see this film because I read a review that made it sound like the Sci-fi heaven. I'm a movie connoisseur and a senior. I have a plethora of sci-fi films under my belt and this one is going to get flushed.I kept waiting for the plot to take off. It seemed like forever before Harrison Ford appeared and I thought, 'Okay, now maybe it will start.'Nope. More explosions. More knives. More guns. Unimpressive 3D. Who's giving high-ratings to this crap?It would have looked better without the 3D (I know cause I took the glasses off a few times, the color was a lot better, but blurry).My impression is that this movie is propaganda for the trans- humanist agenda. Obviously, money is no object.I mean, really? 150 million dollars for THAT? Never, ever again will I depend on these ratings if most of the votes are coming from some source other than reality.",1,6,12,20 November 2017
The Hangover," Low budget, low humor, low-classed, tasteless and generic. Trash.
","This movie being rated with a similar rating as such a great films as 'Some Like it Hot', 'Dr. Strangelove' and 'Annie Hall' shocks me.So generic. I find nothing funny about the same old gag trick of someone suddenly vomiting (which didn't look real, but I don't care), a car being trashed, people beaten up, cars trashed more, more beatings, slap-stick gags, breast shots, genital shots and ugly fat asses and more vomiting.Certainly the writer or whoever, wanted to use shock effect since most people nowadays have seen so much and heard so much that they have to go quite far to shock, but this was sooo cheap and low grade. A few others here have mentioned this as well and I really wish I had read their comments, but they were too far down the chain of praise for this stupidity. I only read the main comment that the IMDb gang has posted as the representative comment. Not to slam IMDb, it's a terrific site and I've used it for years, but there needs to be a balance so that people like myself don't get sucked into shelling out my hard-earned money to be dragged through this trash.It starts right off with insipid, re-hashed, foolish-high-school-kid type pranks which drones on to the very end. And that weird pedophile. What humor does anyone find in a pedophile? Do most people nowadays think it's funny? Or maybe it went over their heads. I don't know. Then the poor little baby was obviously frightened on purpose to get him to cry. Just that alone was upsetting me.I did laugh in a couple of places, but that was after I'd already been sitting there for half an hour kicking myself that I'd actually paid to watch this garbage and that short interval of ha ha didn't make up for the rest of the film which leans heavily on the above-mentioned cheap, low-grade, slutville humor.",1,38,75,10 August 2009
To Rome With Love," One of Woody's all-time Best and (IMO) funnier than most.
","Everyone in the audience was laughing at the dialog and the funny plots. We were definitely in a crowd of Woody Allen fans, even a new-comer would have been laughing.I read the IMDb reviews before watching this film and not all were so positive, so with trepidation we bought the tickets and I'm SO GLAD we did.I can't remember laughing this much while viewing his other films and I enjoyed nearly all of them. Compared to his last goody, Midnight in Paris, the camera-work and lighting were not as well done, but the humor, the actor's delivery and their lines were spot on.There are 2 characters (male) who deliver lines that are definitely from Woody's own experiences. A few times while watching, I could imagine what it would be like to be in his place or in the place of any famous person that realizes they are just a human-being like we all are, yet battling with 'idol' frenzied fans.One thing you know you're going to get in Woody's movie is clever, intelligent and very funny dialog. This film delivers all of that and more.Someone commented that this movie is too long or draggy. My husband and I feel that one scene could have been shortened a bit, but all in all, it was just right for anyone who is a Woody Allen fan.Aside from the plots of the film, the views of Rome make you feel like you're there. One can fully understand his enchantment with this culturally rich city and it's 'roman'tic inhabitants.If you love Woody Allen films, don't miss this one.",8,2,6,5 September 2012
