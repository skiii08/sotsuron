The Rock," The best action movie ever!Poor Jonathan Hensleigh!
","I bought this movie after having it highly recommended by several friends. I did not know what to expect. Their opinions of movies tend to differ alot to mine but they were well on for this one. I have to say when i thought about it before i watched it i was under the impression that the action would not be that good as its set in a prison. How wrong i was! The fact is that this movie has now become my favourite action movie to date. It has everything from non-stop action to terrific characters, a terrific story, terrific actors and some very funny lines. This has to be my favourite movie by Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer to date although i haven't seen Bad Boys 2 yet but i rather doubt i will change my mind. The action is amazing with memorable scenes being a terrific car chase, some brilliant shoot-outs at the prison and some great fight sequences and explosions. Sean Connery and Nicolas cage make a great team and both characters are likeable along with the bad guy Ed Harris as he is not evil, but a guy with a good motive and he is also not a guy who just wants money for him and his guys. Michael Bay should be directing more action movies than disaster movies like Armeageddon and Pearl harbour as they have great action but are overlong and lack a good story and good characters. This movie and Bad Boys were good as they contained great characters and great action which i think he can do best. In conclusion I have to say a huge thank you to Jonathan Hensleigh     ( Die hard 3 and Armeageddon) for writing this movie. He is completely uncredited and very few people know he re-wrote the whole script for this movie but i think he did an outstanding job and should have been credited for his hard work on the script and his contribution to action movies. His over ones which he re-wrote include Con Air and Gone in 60 seconds which he was credited for but not as a writer. I feel so sorry for him though and i cannot wait till his next movie 'The Punisher' comes out. Don't worry Jonathan I will support you all the way! e-mail me if you like! You are the best action movie writer in the business!",10,2,3,28 July 2003
Scarface," Pacino at his best!
","I am a huge fan of Pacino and i have to say that this is his best movie by far. He is absolutely amazing. I cannot see Tony Montana being played by anyone better than him. He has done a great job along with Bregman, Stone and De palma who have also done a great job. I was on the edge of my seat through the whole of this movie! A classic that will never be forgotten! 10/10 unmissable!",10,0,1,19 July 2003
Walk the Line," Fantastic performances in a fantastic film
","Being only 17, I didn't know too much about the legendary music or lives of Johnny Cash and June Carter until this film was released, but after its acclaim for its performances and Reese Witherspoon's Oscar win I fancied checking it out for my self. I wasn't disappointed.This film is highly enjoyable from start to finish moving very quickly and never becoming dull or boring. Writer/director James Magnold is right in focusing on the relationship of the two leads and their chemistry is wonderful to watch. This is largely due to the outstanding performances of Joaquian Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon who give 100% throughout and have several tremendous moments when they're singing their songs. They really do nail their impersonations and disappear into their characters. The soundtrack is also fantastic and I actually found myself singing along throughout. The film really has got me hooked on Cash's music and I intend to listen to some of his in the future.10/10 A great film",10,1,2,23 July 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Very Good Movie and Undeservedly Criticised
","This is, despite lunatic Star Wars fans views, a good movie. OK, its by no means a classic and not flawless, but how many movies are? Huge amounts of unfair pressure were put on George Lucas' shoulders when he decided to make this and episode's II and III, which bither way I think was a good idea as we learn about the unknown stories of the Star Wars Saga.I am only 16 and only just before this movie was released back in 1999 did I start to take an interest in Star Wars. Of course, my brothers and I had always had the toys since we were young like everyone else did and still do, but it never really interested when I was that age for some reason. When I saw this movie it the cinemas I was certainly blown away by it despite not understanding it at all. I was there just to see the action scenes of course like all other young kids. It was that kind of movie you had to see regardless of whether you knew what on earth it was about. It had to be seen purely because it was a Star Wars movie. I recently found out that unsurprisingly that for 20 years fans had been going on and on about it and how they thought it would be the best movie ever made. Well people when you have expectations that high then they'll almost never be matched. Many were disappointed because there wasn't enough action. Come on, there was a lot of action in here and no more than was required really considering the plot and the development of the story. Wait till Episode III if you want all action and darkness.Anyway, back to the movie. I watched this again recently for the first time in ages with full understanding of the events that would later happen.It looks great for a start. The locations are stunning, especially the new planets of COurescant and Naboo. The effects are still breathtaking and the costumes and props all look great. The acting is more than exceptional from Liam Neeson, Ewan Mcgregor and surprisingly from young Jake Lloyd who is not annoying to listen to at all. Samuel L Jackson is also a welcome entry to the series as well along with other Jedi's. Jar Jar Binks is, but only to a limit. Most fans thought he completely wrecked the movie, although the kids loved him, like I did when I saw this when I was 10. 6 years on, true I do find him quite annoying for most of the time but he is still a funny character in some scenes such as the gungan battle with the droids at the end. I must say I did find Natalie Portman a little annoying with scenes portraying her as Queen Amidala, not Padme. Her voice is so dull and wooden I just wanted her to cheer up! But when she is not wearing all the make-up and playing Padme she is very good and more fun and interesting to watch.It is maybe a little too long and does drag at some parts, especially during the political scenes and discussions midway through the film, which I found slightly complex and rather boring, but the ending battles certainly make up for it and overall George Lucas had done a good job of introducing us to an relatively unknown story and setting us up for future story we know well. This is a thoroughly enjoyable and well-made movie.I give it a 9/10 for enjoyment and brilliant effects",9,7,10,13 April 2005
Se7en," My new favourite film of all time
","I saw this film about 5 years ago when I was about 12 and never appreciated it because I had trouble understanding it. I realized that I wasn't really listening to everyhting that was being said. I saw it recently and absolutely loved it. I love suspense thrillers that aren't too complicated and perfectly paced. I wasn't a huge fan of Silence Of The Lambs although it is a good film. The same applied with The Bone Collector, which I thought was well paced but had a pathetic ending with a stupid motive.This movie however is completely flawless. It has great Acting, Directing, Writing, Editing and Photography. I won't delve into the plot as I'm sure you know it. This movie never gets boring at all, every scene is interesting and I think the script is one of the best ever written. I am now a huge fan of Andrew Kevin Walker and David Fincher. Morgan Freeman's performance just about stole it for me, although Pitt and the supporting cast, and the killer especially, were very good (I'm sure you all know who it is but I won't reveal who it is so not to spoil it for anyone.)This movie is not particularly violent to be honest, it just shows some very graphic bodies afterwards but nothing that is unbearable. The last 30 minutes are what really did it for me as far as suspense and surprise goes. It is quite possibly the best ever twist i've seen in a movie and it works perfectly. Everything that is said in the build up to it by the killer comes true. It is so well-paced and done so it doesn't give anything anyway and you'll be glued to the screen, like I was throughout it. The most important thing about this movie is to watch it when you don't have to leave the room or forget about what has gone on previously. You must listen very carefully to it in order to fully understand and appreciate it. When I saw it 5 years ago I didn't appreciate it enough because I wasn't doing this.Overall, this is the best murder-mystery/serial killer movie ever made. it definitely deserves to be in the top 100 movies on IMDb and should be a lower number than 54. it should be in the top 10 in my opinion. I keep changing my mind about my favourite film so sorry about that! Anyway, It has everything needed to be perfect as explained above. Go and see this film if you adore your mystery's or perhaps any type of movie. You will not be disappointed.A definite 10/10",10,1,2,9 October 2004
Brokeback Mountain," I've had a massive change of heart
","Back in February when the Oscar race was heating up, I saw Crash and was blown away by it as written. However, I hadn't seen Brokeback Mountain and for that reason had a slight hope Crash might win. I honestly wish I had seen it back then. While I loved Crash, having seen this film today I can honestly say it was ten times better and deserved every award it received. I actually think its a crying shame and insult the Acadamy passed over this film and played it safe with Crash in a clear attempt to stay clear from controversy.Before seeing this film I had no problem with gay people in general or in society. Although I was not a person who was a strong believer in Gay rights, I did agree that a relationship between people of any sex is about people who love each other no matter what age, colour, race etc. and they should be free to express that in society. After seeing this film my views are stronger and I honestly was moved for the second time this week (having watched Once Upon a Time in America a few days before although Brokeback Mountain is even better.) Heath Ledger, Jake Gylenhall, Michelle Williams, Anne Hathway and many others turn in outstanding performances here, with Ledger and Gylenhall carrying the film. Their scenes at Brokeback Mountain and when they reunite throughout are some of the most powerful and emotional I've ever seen and I actually shed tears on several occasions. They heavily strengthened my belief from earlier further and I now strongly understand the torment and sadness many homosexual people suffer at the hands of many society's today. God bless all of you.The deepest thanks go to Ang Lee, the writer of the short story Anne Proulx and screenwriters Larry McMurty and Diana Ossana for forming this masterpiece. Also worthy of much recognition are the Oscar winning score and beautiful photography.A tremendous achievement and landmark in cinema history 10/10",10,45,52,1 July 2006
Home Alone," An all time classic!
","I remember watching this movie all the time while I was growing up. I never got bored of it. The gags are funny, the acting is great and the atmosphere is quite scary actually. The music is also quite haunting. Candy was also brill in his cameo The plot is well-known, so I can't be bothered to get into it but the thing I love the most about this movie and the 2nd one is the lovely subplots thrown in. The one with that old man who's supposedly a killer is done in a lovely way and it really sends out a message of don't judge people by their appearances. The end as well SPOILER where the guy is reunited with his family because of kevin's advice is one of the most touching moments I've ever seen on film in my life!This movie is brill 10/10",10,0,1,14 November 2004
Crash," Ensemble cast deliver outstanding performances in one of the best films i've ever seen
","I'd heard much hype about this film over the last few months and when it topped Eberts list for 2005 and was nominated for all its awards I knew I had to check it out. My expectations were quite high, but I wasn't disappointed. It was actually even better than I thought. The story contains several intertwining story lines involving around 20 people from many races that collide in the space of 36 hours. Its truly amazing to watch all these characters effected and how they change throughout. The film is really showing how people are in this day and age and how they react to different situations.The best thing about the film is the cast, which is one of the biggest I can think of. Although some are given slightly more screen time than others, none dominate the picture, although there are certainly several stand-out performances. For me, the best performance came from Michael Lena as a locksmith who has some of the films most powerful and emotional scenes. He was criminally overlooked at the SAG awards by not being included in the award for ensemble cast, even though William Fichtner (though the good actor he is) was only in one scene and was included. However, his performance was Oscar Worthy and I really hope he goes onto bigger and better things after this because his performance was truly tremendous.He is nearly matched by Don Cheadle and Matt Dillon whos performances seem to get better and better every new movie they star in and Dillon received a well deserved nomination. Good luck to him come the Acadamey Awards. The other performances are all first-rate and everyone has significant roles in the story.Speaking of the Acadamey Awards, though I haven't seen the other nominated films, it appears to be a two-legged race between Crash and Brokeback Mountain. Although I haven't seen Brokeback I would really love Crash to win Best Picture as it really is one of the most challenging and thought provoking films I can think of.Overall, this is a must see film for every mature person out there and provides a realist look at modern day people and how we react to those around us.10/10",10,0,5,18 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Way better than Episode I and another undeservedly criticised movie
","In my review of Episode I, I commented on how badly Lucas had been bashed because of it for a variety of reasons even though I thought it was actually a very good movie. The same happens here even though Episode II is way better than Episode I with way more action, even better locations, a stunning digital look due to outstanding special effects and the further development of the Story with a plot which is a lot less complex and more interesting than that in Episode I, probably because its getting closer to things we hear about in Episode IV.For a start, the planets are great, with Coruscant and Tattoine looking better than ever but Naboo looks the best here with amazing views and scenery. New planets Kamino and Geonosis are also breathtaking though as well. This is where the special effects come into their own. The clone Army looks amazing as well, especially in the scene at the end with several thousand of them boarding spaceships and taking off. The action as I've already said exceeds what we saw in Episode I, kicking off with a sensational chase through Coruscant, and following on with other spectacular scenes including a Battle between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jango Fet, a Jedi Vs Droid arena battle,and finally the best fight in the movie and probably the most pulsating witnessed in any Star Wars movie- Yoda Vs. Count Dooku. Although it could've been longer this battle makes the movie worth seeing alone.The acting is both good and average. Ewan Mcgregor really reminds us of Alec Guiness here as the old Obi-Wan Kenobi from Episode's IV, V and VI as he has a much bigger part than he did in Episode I. He delivers one unintentionally hilarious line here when he says 'I have work to do', whilst being held captive on Geonosis by Dooku. Natatlie Portman is also good as well in her returning role as Padme. People have been mixed on Hayden Christensen. I felt he was a bit too wimpish in most scenes to be honest and spoke as if he's acting in a Shakespeareian play Judging by the way he says lines slowly like 'Why couldn't I save her, I know I could have'. The dialogue in the romantic scenes has been well-documented. I agree, it is a bit cheesy and could've been better had they shortened some of Anakin's lines to 'Could've instead of could have' etc. , but never mind. Moving on, Christopher Lee looks to be savouring his role as Count Dooku and makes a pretty good villain despite not appearing until towards the end.Overall, this is a great Star Wars entry and I really can't wait for Episode III, due out next month. 10/10",10,0,1,13 April 2005
Forrest Gump," Simply Outstanding
","What a movie. I remember the first time I saw it with my family and myself and my mum cried, but it was such a great, powerful and deeply moving film. The script, acting, directing, music, effects and every other aspect are outstanding. The key to this film though here is Hanks. I do not believe any other actor in the world could have played the part as well as he did. He really is one of the best actors around these days. People keep on saying that this movie mugged Shawshank Redmption at the Oscars, which is very unfair because although that is also one of my favourite films, this just about overtook it for me. The script by Eric Roth and Hanks's acting here for me do by a small amount outdo Shawshank although many will disagree. In fact I don't know how earth Alan Silvestri's score didn't get an Oscar. It is probably one of the best i've ever heard and The Lion King definitely didn't deserve it i'm afraid. The same applies to Sinise's performance which also deserved an Oscar. Anyway this film deserved its Oscars and is one of the greatest films of all time.A classic. 10/10",10,1,4,15 January 2005
Apocalypse Now," A terrfic war movie with strong performances and messages
","Although ,I'm not going to go into all the details about the fiolm, I did enjoy find Apocalypse Now and found it an interesting and thoughtful expperience. There are some scenes of incredible shock, power and pain which all make the viewer think about the realities of war and the effect it has on people. Martin Sheen is brilliant inb the lead role and I particularly enjoyed the narration. My favourite scenes are towards the end with in a darkly lit temple featuring Sheen and Marlon Brando, who is stunnning in his small performance. His apparently improvised speeches left me thinking, confused and hooked which is likely to have been Coppola's intention for such a complex character. The supporting performances from Duvall, Hopper and others are also very good as well. Also worth mentioning are the superbly photographed and brilliantly staged battle scenes, particularly at the 30 minute point which look brilliant for a film 26 years old.Although not one of my favourite films and is slightly too long, I highly recommend this film.9/10",9,0,1,21 March 2006
Edward Scissorhands," A wonderfully moving film
","I have seen this many times over the years and my view that it is truly a masterpiece has never changed. It is simply Tim Burton at his best with the use of Gothic and mystical sets, dark humour and wonderful performances. The real show stealer here for me though has to be the score of Danny Elfman which is truly something to behold. I have always been a huge fan of his and Burton has used him in every film I can think of. Here he is at his peak. The score here perfectly captures the tone of the film brilliantly and is at is best during the scene where Winona Ryder dances in the snow while Johhny Depp is cutting an ice block towards the end. It should have won an Oscar and is one of the best, if not the best scores i've ever heard.Perormances of the entire cast led by Depp and Ryder are top notch and the cinematography beautifully captures the 1950's town and dark mansion perfectly. I have to say this is my favourite Tim Burton film purely because it shows what a wonderful vision he has and the fantasy and tragedy of his story really works well. I believe this is heavily underrated but looks to be finally receiving the acclaim it deserves here on IMDb. Long may it continue.Beautiful 10/10",10,0,1,24 November 2005
Independence Day," One of my all-time favourite films!
","I love this film. I am 16 now and was only 8 when it was released so I didn't really understand it, but having watched it again recently now older and maturer I get the plot and I think this movie is very well written, acted and directed. So overall it is a great movie. It never gets boring for a minute and moves very qucikly with some simply fantastic special effects shots, such as the devastation of New York, Washington and LA along with some great air battles and suspense moments. The plot is simple. Millions of aliens in giant spaceships are moving through galaxy after galaxy consuming every natural resource in its path, moving on afterwards and Earth is next. Jeff Goldblum figures it out and warns the President, Bill Pullman to evacuate the main cities as soon as possible. However by the time this happens its too late. People are so silly and panic driven that they all get blown to smithereens. The survivors around the world (inlcuding Will Smith and Randy Quaid in one of their greatest performances!) then try and try to bring down the ships. They try just about eveything until they finally figure out how to do it.Anyway this movie is brilliant and deserved to do well at the Box Office considering the amount of effort put into making it. The rating should be in the 8.1 or 8.2 region as far as I'm concerned, not 6.0. The movie as I've already said moves fast and the effects are great but the best part of it are the performances of the actors and the script which I think are both flawless. The scenes where they're talking about there plans to bring the ships down are found difficult to understand by some people but I found them very easy and they are certainly well written. The main characters being Smith, Pullman, Quaid and Goldblum are great and this movie is great!Go watch it! 10/10",10,1,6,31 August 2004
Good Will Hunting," Despite one or two flaws, worth watching for some excellent performances and a fairly original story
","Having been meaning to see this film for a long time I finally managed to last week and was largely impressed.The film is very entertaining and has many memorable scenes of great acting and writing that are some of the best out there. I don't want to get into the plot other than say it is fairly plausible and original, borrowing from other genres but never feeling like its something we've seen before.First of all, I'll talk about the films most impressive aspects. The best thing about this film by far is Robin Williams. I haven't seen too much of his dramatic work but his performance here is certainly the best I've seen him give and was definitely deserving of his Oscar. He wonderfully delivers some of the best emotional scenes in the film and is brilliant in virtually every scene he's in. Similarly, Minnie Driver is impressive as Will's girlfriend and brings a lot of welcome humour and credibility to her role and, along with Williams, keeps the film mature and not too immature- something I'll talk about soon. Similarly, Stellan Skarsgard is solid as a mathematician both jealous and fascinated by Will's talents.The other good thing about the film is many scenes in the film. Many of the scenes between Will and Sean are well written and their is a fascinating and compelling speech made by Damon towards the end of the film on his refusal to work for the government.The always excellent Danny Elfman delivers a very good score also.Unfortunately these good aspects are held back by the completely unnecessary amount of gratuitous swearing throughout and average performances of Damon and Ben Affleck. If profanity is done tastefully and humorously (as shown by Quentin Tarantino) or is said out of desperation then that can help the material work. Here it doesn't. I didn't keep count but this film has an unbelievable amount of bad language that added nothing to the story and just felt like it was being used to fill dead spots in a conversation.Another problem is the character of Will. He is far too cocky, arrogant and foul-mouthed to evoke sympathy and I believe his character should have been altered to make him a little more likable. Similarly Damon (despite one or two decent emotional scenes) is not very impressive either. Then again, thats probably his characters fault. The most annoying aspect of the film is Ben Affleck's character who I actually got so annoyed with I felt as though his screen time should have been shortened by half. Like Damon's, his character is the complete opposite to the one he plays in Armageddon and is largely unlikable and unappealing given he acts so stupidly throughout. Affleck (again, despite one good scene towards the end) therefore is unable to bring likability to his role either.However, thanks to an original and intriguing story, some excellent performances by Williams, Driver and Skarsgard, the film is well worth watching.8/10",8,0,2,7 September 2006
The Football Factory," Not sure what to make of this
","Being a big football fan of West Brom, I heard about this film and borrowed it today. I knew it was about football violence and its certainly featured in all its gruesome detail in this. However, it ended rather disappointingly. There was an interesting subplot but in the end several plot holes were left and the main question in the film at the end and the main characters feelings about what he does are completely forgotten. I was also diappointed by the end of this film overall. It basically promotes football violence and when the characters are beaten up you don't feel for them as they do it all the time to hundreds of other men. I'm sure football hooligans themselves will love this, but I ain't one and there must be more swear words in this film than any i've ever seen in my life. The characters don't talk any sense whatsoever. There probably didn't even need to be a script for this film as the actors could just improvise all their swear words for every scene as they didn't have much else to say. At the end of the day these men live for nothing. They're just a bunch of thugs who go round beating people up and thats it. Nothing else. Some life. So I must say although this film was well made in some respects there is no sentiment whatsoever and I actually felt as though it was a waste of time in the end. I give it a 6/10 and thats being very generous because it probably deserves much lower.",6,9,18,8 November 2004
Million Dollar Baby," What a wonderfully moving film
","Although, I haven't seen the other 4 films nominated for the Best Picture Oscar in 2004, Clint Eastwoods 'Million Dollar Baby' was certainly a worthy winner. Beautifully written, acted and filmed, this is the sort of film you have to sit back and experience. It is a mature and realistic story that seems so original and interesting that you can't help but admire those involved with it.As far as boxing films are concerned this is definitely on par with Rocky and Raging Bull- possibly the two most memorable ones of the genre for the last 30 years. They each tell a different story that works in its one way.Eastwood, Swank, Freeman and the rest of the supporting cast are outstanding and Paul Haggis' script contains plenty of memorable scenes between the characters and you really do get more and more involved as the story progresses.I urge you to see this moving film whenever you get the chance.10/10",10,4,8,18 September 2006
Dumb and Dumber," One of my favourite comedies of all time
","Goodness me, I've seen this movie God knows how many times and it never gets boring each time. Carrey and Daniels are fantastic and this is The Farrelly Brothers best movie to date. This is also probably Carrey's best film. I laughed my ass off the first time I saw it and have done every time I've watched it. It never gets boring and the plot is very simple as it develops into a road movie. Recently Road Trip was made which is similar to this and I found that funny, but nowhere near as good as this. I won't give away any of the gags or jokes because they'll be a hell of a lot funnier when you actually watch them, but they are possibly the best ever. I own this classic and I can assure you, this is a must see and even own for big Carrey and comedy fans. Anyway thats enough of me, go and buy it right now!",10,0,1,1 November 2004
Shrek 2," Excellent sequel which is much better than the first!
","This sequel is a fantastic experience that has to be enjoyed by everyone! Having seen the first film and being very pleased with what I saw I knew it would be hard to match it, but this more than matches it and completely surpassed my expectations. There were huge laughs in the cinemas throughout and it never looks like getting boring so i'm glad Shrek 3 and 4 are in the works. In Both movies Diaz, Myers and Murphy have done fantastic jobs and Banderas is a welcome addition to this excellent film. The graphics, one liners and spoofs are also very funny and it really does make you leave the cinema with a smile on your face. Overall this film must be seen by everyone and I can now see why it has been so successful worldwide!",10,0,1,27 June 2004
Once Upon a Time in America," Absolutely Outstanding
","I originally heard of this movie about 2 or 3 years ago and didn't really know much of what it was about or who it starred. However, about 8 months ago I stumbled upon a review of John Ulmer (an IMDb critic I generally agree with and respect) who believed it to be a forgotten gangster flick that was just as good as The Godfather and Goodfellas.After hearing such praise in his review and on IMDb I knew I had to find out more and try to see it when I could. Being a fan of Gangster films, Robert DeNiro and non-linear movies (such as Tarantino films and The Godfather Part II) I knew it must be worth seeing. Having finally got it last Christmas I had high expectations and perhaps that was the reason I was disappointed on my first viewing. I didn't have a problem with the running time. It was that it was that I found it a little too hard to understand and what messages it was trying to convey. Otherwise I thought the film was brilliantly made. However, I thought it would be unfair to judge the film after one viewing. Moreover, it seemed it was a movie that required several viewings to realise its full messages.Today, 5 months on, I gave the film its second chance and was absolutely blown away. Having seen it before, I understood more about the characters and their situations. The film is absolutely outstanding and warrants every minute of it 3 1/2 hour running time. I can understand why so much anger arose from it being butchered into a mess on its release. It is not a quick 90 minute action or comedy flick. Its much deeper than that. I'm of the opinion that its a dream of a man looking back at his past and into the future- looking at his good times, bad times, regrets and what could be coming in his life. I think the deepest message of the film is to choose the life YOU want to lead and live it to the full otherwise you may live in regret. Perhaps I'm wrong but I don't think thats the point. I think Sergio Leone has left the viewer to make up their own minds about it. I have done so. Perhaps I'll find other messages each time I watch it. Thats the sort of masterpiece this film is.On the subject of the film itself it's virtually flawless on every level. However, there's two particular things that stand out for me and I feel should be mentioned slightly above the rest - Ennio Morricone's truly outstanding score and the brilliant production design of an early 1900 New York which, in my opinion, tops that of The Godfather Part II flashbacks. I had never heard of Morricone before I saw this film but his score for it could well be THE greatest I've ever heard. As pointed out on the trivia section of IMDb it was criminally unable to be considered for an Oscar because of another mistake by the distributors. The score beautifully captures the films tone, particularly in the scenes between Noodles and Deborah. He also has several others which also work perfectly throughout the film. As far as the Production Design is concerned New York looks absolutely outstanding in the 1900's scenes and also in the 1930's ones. For the former in particular, every shot (like in Coppola's Godfather Trilogy) is beautifully designed and contains all kinds of early 20th century aspects you can think of such as smoke, horses, shop signs etc. Even in the indoor scenes, all the buildings and designs look very contemporary and every effort has gone into making you feel the film is taking place 70-100 years ago. They succeeded, and I honestly found it impossible to believe this film was shot in 1984.Other aspects of the film are tremendous as well. DeNiro (in what appears a largely forgotten role) and Woods are both outstanding in the leads along with the others such as Tuesday Weld, Joe Pesci, Burt Young, Elizabeth Mcgovern and others. However, some of the real scene-stealer's are the child actors featured in the 1900's scenes- my favourite section of the movie. Scott Tiler matches DeNiro as Noodles and a truly beautiful young Jennifer Connelly (who has deservedly gone onto bigger things and is now an Oscar winner) in my opinion upstages Elizabeth Mcgovern. The rest of the child actors all do good jobs as well.Leone's Direction and vision really shine through here with the use of Tonino Delli Colli's photography. It is particularly evident in the 1900's scenes featuring the young Deborah walkthing through crowds.Don't be put off by the 3 1/2 hour running time. This film is one of the few such as The Godfather Trilogy, The Green Mile and Titanic that warrants its running time. Both times I've watched it, it moved very fast and I was never bored. Leone always keeps you interested and I never looked at my watch or felt uncomfortable. In fact I honestly felt as though I'd been watching a 2 hour film instead of nearly 4 hour one when I watched it today.If I had any criticisms they would be of one or two distasteful scenes. I didn't have a huge problem with the disturbing rape scene as i think it was trying to tell you more about Noodles' character. However, I heavily disliked the baby switching scene, finding it incredibly distasteful and unnecessary. I know the characters aren't very likable, but that scene went too far for me.Otherwise, there's nothing else that can be criticised about this masterpiece. It is now one my all-time favourites alongside Seven and The Green Mile, and I believe as John Ulmer rightly said, 'No-one should go a lifetime without seeing this wonderfully moving film'.10/10",10,4,10,27 June 2006
Eyes Wide Shut," A complete waste of time
","I sat through this long, slow moving movie about a year ago and when it finally ended I couldn't believe that was it and I'd just sat there for nearly 3 hours watching such rubbish. It builds up suspense then at the end just forgets all about it and thats it! It starts off reasonably well, and has very good acting from Cruise and Kidman in the 2 leads, but the story itself doesn't make sense at all. All the movie is really is Tom Cruise wondering around New York having heard his wife had an affair, to meet a grieving woman, a prostitute, an old friend, a costume shop owner, and finally onto an erotic party. He also spends about $1000 in the space of 2 days and doesn't care that much! This whole evening takes up about an hour and a half of the movie and is incredibly slow-moving and annoying as the lines are slow and it moves at a snails pace the entire time. Then its the next day and everything is really weird and by the end of it you're thinking what the hell? There are that many plot-holes and their is no point in the movie at all!In the end this movie left me confused, bored and annoyed. So I advise you to skip this and watch a good move like The Green Mile or Seven.This is a complete waste of time and I give it 3/10 only for Cruise and Kidman's acting which was good I must say",3,0,4,17 December 2004
Psycho," Witness a master filmmaker at work
","The second most suspenseful and compelling film I've ever seen (just behind Jonatahn Mostow's outstanding but heavily underrated 'Breakdown') Psycho is a true classic and is rightly hailed as one of the greatest films ever made. The story is so simple and easy to follow, but Hitchcock brilliantly uses the late Joseph Stefano's screenplay to squeeze every bit of nerve and suspense out of the viewer (most notably in the two death scenes).The performances are all terrific, but the standout performance belongs to Perkins offering one of the most chilling portrayals your ever likely to see on screen.If you haven't seen this yet you're truly missing out on a great piece of cinema. Watch it now! 10/10",10,0,0,18 September 2006
The Green Mile," The best movie I have ever seen!!!!!
","I saw 5 minutes of this movie once when it was on TV and didn't really think much of it. When it was on again and there was nothing else on i decided to sit down and watch it. I was absolutely astounded. I have never been so touched by a movie in my life. The script, directing, acting, effects. absolutely everything in this movie was perfect.Firstly the story was terrific and not complicated and Frank Darabont produced a terrific script that should have won an Oscar along with his terrific direction. The acting was utterly superb. every single actor and actress in this movie were terrific. These included Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan, Michael Jeter, David Morse, Bonnie hunt and many more. However out of them all the 2 actors that touched me the most were Jeter and Duncan. I heard never seen Michael Clarke Duncan in another movie before until i saw this and he produced the best performance i have ever seen an actor give! How he did not win the Oscar for it, i will never know but i can assure you he gave the best performance an actor could give. Michael Jeter also came over my predictability as Del. i had only seen him in JP3 in a smaller part but he was excellent and made his character touching and had a heart even though he had comitted a murder. I believe his character was designed for a much smaller part but Jeter made him so much better and gave him the heart he had.I am very sad to hear about his death very recently i will greatly miss him as he had a terrific talent and although he was not very well known his performance in this movie will never be forgotten ( at least by me anyway!). Tom Hanks and David Morse are also excellent as the security guards and are brilliant throughout the movie.Overall this movie showed me that all these smaller actors like David Morse, Michael Jeter and especially Michael Clarke Duncan can act brilliantly even though they are not as famous or well known as Hanks and others. However he heart of this movie comes from believing miracles can happen. I didn't really but after seeing this movie i was always believe in miracles.Frank Darabont has produced a wonderful classic that should never be forgotten and should be watched by every person with a heart and who has some beliefs. Or someone who doesn't it doesn't matter! After watching this movie i can assure you that you will have second thoughts.Not to be missed.     10/10",10,0,1,9 July 2003
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Absolutely Amazing and for me could just about be the best Star Wars Movie
","Just saw this tonight on its opening day and let me just say it is absolutely amazing. As stated in my summary it possibly just edges it as the best Star Wars film for me past Episode IV. It is definitely the darkest Star Wars film by miles surpassing The Empire Strikes Back enormously in my opinion. Everything about the film is perfect- the Acting, Writing, Direction, but most of all the Special Effects. Every single actor does a brilliant job in this movie, but the one that I'm surprised to say impressed me the most has to be Yoda voiced by Frank Oz who is particularly outstanding. However he is almost matched especially by Ian Mcdiarmid who is brilliant as the evil Emperor. Ewan Mcgregor, Hayden Christensen, Natalie Portman, Samuel L Jackson and the rest of the cast though are also terrific.The special effects, most notably in the first 20 minutes are breathtaking and continue throughout the film brilliantly in particular in the final 2 battles between Yoda and The Emperor and Obi-Wan and Anakin, which are both breathtaking, especially the Yoda and Emperor one which I thought was the best in the movie. General Grievous is a excellent new villain and has a great fight with Obi-Wan midway through the film. Its also great to see Chewbacca again, who although has a very small role is exactly how we remember him- loving and devoted. Also great to finally see the birth of Darth Vader which is both shocking tragic and emotional at the same time and George Lucas really is a masterful storyteller. We are also be able to understand the importance is Episodes I and II and the development of his character and all those people who heavily criticsed these 2 movies should now be able to understand their significance to the saga.I could go on and on about how great this film was and be here all day but to sum up this movie in my opinion is the best Star Wars film out of the whole 6 film saga. Its wonderful to watch all the pieces to fall into place and was really emotional in the last hour and towards the closing scenes.Thank you George Lucas for giving us a series of truly unforgettable classics that'll I'll never forget.A definite 10/10",10,1,6,19 May 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," They don't get much better than this
","This movie is simply outstanding and is one of the best if not the best I've ever seen. Its my joint 3rd favourite with Darabont's other great king adaptation The Green Mile and Seven. This movie is flawless on every level. The key to it though is possibly the greatest ever script ever written by Darabont, and truly outstanding acting from Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. No need to go into the plot. This movie is all about hope and will inspire you to do anything. The brilliant ending is definitely the best i've ever seen and brought a tear to my eye. Watch this movie whenever your happy or sad. It doesn't matter. The film will give you so much hope and happiness. It really is that brilliant. In fact i'm watching it now.WATCH IT NOW 10/10- Probably the greatest movie ever made",10,0,1,4 January 2005
The Deer Hunter," Despite being slightly too long, well worth watching due to some excellent performances and powerful scenes
","Having finally being able to see this film recently, I have to say it did live up to my expectations and is certainly a very good film. Although I don't think its as good as Apocalypse Now or other war films I've seen, it is still an interesting study of the effects of war people.The performances are all great, particularly DeNiro and Walken during the Vietnam scenes where the terrifying and brilliantly filmed Russian Roulette sequence takes place. Although the film is slow moving during the first hour it is never boring and always keeps you interested.An interesting and occasionally harrowing film. 9/10",9,1,2,20 September 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Absolutely Outstanding
","PERFECTION has to be the best word to describe this terrific movie. It has everything you could ever want including a great story, characters, direction, editing, sound music, effects, acting, funny lines, settings. I could go on forever with praise talking about how outstanding this movie is and how emotional it was.It has to be the greatest movie ever made. FOTR and TTT were both terrific as well but this one has to be the best of all three by far. Once I walked out that cinema theatre I was just blown away and knew it was and if you haven't seen it yet then let me tell you now. This movie will take your breath away. Enjoy now and for many milleniums to come!Outstanding! 1000000000000/10",10,0,0,28 December 2003
Goodfellas," Possibly the greatest ever gangster movie
","I had to see this movie ever since I first heard about it. I never used to watch gangster films but this one is certainly the greatest as far as i'm concerned along with Godfather I and II and Scarface following very closely behind. The performances, writing, directing are all outstnading. No actor is slightly better or worse and they are all matched by each other. Liotta, De Niro and Pesci are a fantastic team and they really do make you feel what its like in the world of the mafia. Nicholas Pileggi and Martin Scorese's script is outstanding is certainly Oscar worthy. But the acadamey disagreed. At least they didn't look down on Pesci's brilliant supporting performance. De Niro could also have won it and should have been nominated. But in my opinion Liotta desreved Best Actor. He is basically taking us on a guide of his 30 years of his life in the mafia and you just cannot take your eyes or ears for that matter of it for one second. The narration is done so brilliantly that you'd think Liotta was actually a member of the mafia! Anyway this a fantastic film about the ups and down these three guys (goodfellas) have throughout their time in the mafia and it has to be seen by everyone at some point in there life!A certain 10/10",10,0,0,30 June 2004
Dodgeball," I haven't laughed that hard for ages! Absolutely Hilarious!
","This movie was best of the movie of the year, well at least so far. It was so funny. There was barely a minute that passed when there wasn't any laughs. I won't go into the plot because you probably know it but let me tell you if you don't laugh at this there is not much else you will laugh at. The last time I laughed so hard at the cinema was when I saw Austin Powers Goldmember. Anyway Ben Stiller was superb in this movie along with the rest of the cast, but Stiller really did steal it for me. He was brilliant as the villain and the last scene in the movie had me laughing all the way home.Go and check this movie out right now and have yourself some big laughs!",10,1,2,3 October 2004
