Iron Man 3," Hugely disappointed
","I wasn't blown away, Iron man was supposed to be a hero who is not afraid and right after he threats the villains he goes down....They should have let Sir Ben Kingsley play the negative role. The suits were mere fire cracker at the end, to show his love to the chick..... Seriously i thought the franchise ended right after his arc reactor was removed....This was a pathetic desperate attempt to show that IRON MAN is not only the Armour. Always wondered what happens to tony without his suit and used to thinks hulk is better that iron man but turns out hulk is way awesome.....Other things about the movie were great...But sadly i lost my love for the IRON MAN and hope they bring him back like fans expect to see him in Avengers...",5,6,12,4 May 2013
