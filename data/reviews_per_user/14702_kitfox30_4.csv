It," This movie is awful.
","I have been reading Stephan King books since i was a child, and i have never been so disappointed in a movie from one of his books.
I was an still am, a huge fan of the 1990 original and that being saif, I am curious to know what drugs people on wee when they said this was a good scary movie?
It was a yawn-fest with so much detail removed or changed it irritated rather than scared me. Like Bev in the web... never happened, like the bully falling in a well... never happened, like all of Geogie being taken, c'mon people... it was only his arm! This movie tally sucks and am bot even going to bother with chapter 2!!",1,1,3,13 November 2018
The Mummy," Well, y'know
","I saw this movie in a theatre on a blind date. My date was upset because i kept laughing, but have to say I liked it enough to catch the next two as well as The Scorpion King in theatres too.
One thing I thought odd, was that at no time in the movie does Ardeth
Bay say his name, but in the 2nd movie hey know it!
I wasn't a big fan of the 3td one with no Oded Fehr and a different actress playing Evelyn.",8,0,0,22 November 2019
The Mummy Returns," For a sequel, not bad SPOILERS
","There were a few flaws in this movie I wanted to point out. Their son, Alex is eight. If you took the year they met and added it up until the time setting that is only seven years, which meant he couldn't be Rick's son unless he had a one night stand with Evie that neither remembered.In the first movie Ardeth Bay never tells them what his name is, it is never mentioned, but in the second movie they greet him by name.As sequels go it was pretty good. An added bonus is buying the DVD two disc version that gives you much back history on the people and characters depicted in the movie. It also has a blooper reel that still makes me laugh. I do enjoy it and the first one too including that beautiful white cat that should've been around for the whole movie. The third one i found a little silly and completely unnecessary, but this was not a bad movie, it really did have some great moments.",7,0,0,10 June 2017
It Chapter Two," Unrewarding
","I was happy I didn't pay for this, the first one was horrible and almost as far removed from the book as 1980's 'The Shining (though i like that one far more than the remake)
Well after seeing this 3 hour snore fest and seeing all the goofs and holes, I wholeheartedly favour the original 1990's version. Believe me, I am not alone in thinking it is better.",2,2,2,19 September 2019
