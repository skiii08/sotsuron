Raiders of the Lost Ark," I can watch it over and over again and never get tired of!
","There is no doubt in my mind that Indiana Jones is the best movie francaise in the history of cinema. This is my all time favorite film. This is simply the best action film ever made. That will stand the test of time forever. I've seen Raiders of the Lost Ark numerous times, with no lesser joy. This film has it all: action, romance, comedy, and suspense. From the start to the end you are hooked to this movie. I just love every bit of it. Harrison Ford is one of my all time favorite actor, he brings THE greatest and most charismatic character on the silver screen in this Steven Spielberg and George Lucas collaboration. Indiana Jones is the likable, stubborn, intelligent, and determinedan archaeologist adventurer with his trademark hat, whip, leather jacket, and pistol he spends his time traveling all over the world through jungles, deserts, oceans, and caverns in search for hidden treasures. He escapes countless dangers, including fighting thugs in a busy Cairo bazaar, and hangs underneath a fast-moving truck in an exciting chase through a dusty road, just to name a few. You can't forget John William's classic score which is one of those themes that just everybody in the world knows. Steven Spielberg wanted to bring back the classic B-film adventure movies. Instead, he created one of the most revolting and loved films of all time. All three Indiana Jones stories were entertaining but this first one is still the best. I would think most people would agree with me on that. They would also agree this film has some very memorable scenes, - like the opening one with the gigantic boulder chasing Indy - to the ending scene with the Ark of the Convenant opened - that will be Hollywood classics for years to come. This will always be considered the greatest adventure film of all time.",10,2,4,7 February 2015
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The fourth film never happened this is the perfect final chapter in the greatest trilogy of all time.
","Of all the franchises in the history of film-making, not a single one boasts a better third installment than The Last Crusade. This movie has it all: action, comedy, adventure, mystery, horror, romance, and a perfect way to end a flawless trilogy. Last Crusade also has the most depth of the trilogy. The whip cracking, Nazi fighting, archaeology adventure was still there, but with the third film, audiences were shown Indinan's origins and how Henry Jones Jr. became Indiana. The addition of Sean Connery as Indy's father gave the movie an extra dose of humor and a connection to Spielberg's inspiration for the series â€” James Bond. Connery was initially skeptical about the role because he's only 12 years older than Harrison Ford. But being that James Bond was the original inspiration for the character, producers were set on bagging Connery. Once Connery was on board, he and Harrison Ford had instant chemistry. A lot of scenes where improvised by the actors like the one where Sean Connery says the line 'She talks in her sleep.' The script, by Jeffrey Boam, improves on it's previous by paying more attention to characterization. The whole supporting cast is all- around great; John Rhys-Davies is back as Sallah, funny and wonderful as ever. Denholm Elliot also returns as Marcus Brody, the lovable goof form Raiders of the Lost Ark. Alison Doody plays Elsa the backstabbing blonde bombshell, Julian Glover is the best of the Indiana Jones main villains, But the man steals the show is Michael Byrne as the Jones hating Colonel Vogel, who relishes in torturing Indy and his father. It's Spielberg's wide-eyed enthusiasm that turns The Last Crusade into the wildest and wittiest Indy of them all. His message is to stop searching for messages and join in the fun.",10,0,2,8 February 2015
