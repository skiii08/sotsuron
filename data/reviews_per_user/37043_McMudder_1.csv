The Blair Witch Project," Scariest movie I've seen since I was a kid!
",I really enjoyed the movie.  It was suspensful and very well done.  It was different from anything I've seen and allows the viewer to use their imagination to fill in the blanks.  Good one!!!  My only caution is the jerky camera-work might be a strain for anyone who gets motion-sickness!,9,0,1,6 August 1999
