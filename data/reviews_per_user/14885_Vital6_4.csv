Blade Runner 2049," Enjoyable film, but bring ear muffs!
","Fun movie, lots of beautiful scenery. A bit boring and long, almost 3 hours. Didn't feel that length though so it was tolerable. It's definitely a well crafted universe though and feels like it could be real, much like the original. Two gripes though. 1, the replicants are basically humans, they don't add anything at all on how they are produced or how they differ from humans. I always assumed that they were robots or at least cyborg but they don't show anything about this. 2nd, the movie is actually painfully loud, it will hurt your ears. This is inexcusable and I don't know if it's by design or what. Actually remembering that pisses me off so I'm going to drop some stars.",5,6,13,21 October 2017
Captain Marvel," A decent film that is ruined by rushed storytelling, poor action and a terrible lead.
","Jackson and Mendelson were great, there's some great interaction between them that results in some funny moments. Brie Larson however is terrible. There is something off about the character she's trying to play. I don't know if it is the writing or the actor herself but it was distracting and really brought the movie down. Very little action, what there is is nor filmed particularity well. Oftentimes it is distorted or filmed with a bunch of quick cuts inserted. The plot is a bit contrived and not very much is explained. It would of been better to give more backstory to Carl Danver's time before earth perhaps or at least explain the limitations or function of her power. What we are left with is an incredibly simplistic story that is utterly predictable. It seems disjointed as well, as though it was rushed into editing, resulting with alot ofncontent cut.
Captain Marvels superhero outfit is simply terrible. It looks incredibly fake and awkward.
The interaction between Fury and the cat was offputting and forced.
Probably my least favorite Marvel film so far, other than the hulk one.",4,3,4,12 March 2019
The Witch," Few redeeming qualities and a grossly misrepresented genre.
","Usually the amount of patrons that leave a theater in the middle of a showing is a accurate representation of a films worth. Four people did so at the 7pm showing of Robert Eggers' 'The Witch' and I can't really blame them. The movie itself is well acted and the interaction between the characters is believable. Couple that with the excellent sets and costumes, period anarchism's and speech and you can actually believe that this is how 17th century Calvinists would of lived. However at no time did I feel frightened or unsettled by what was happening on screen. More than once myself and the majority of the audience actually laughs out loud or groaned in embarrassment at a sequence that was clearly intended to produce frights. In fact it is my opinion that this would of been a much better film if stripped of all supernatural elements and presented as merely a family drama that dealt with the issues of isolationism, mistrust and the effects of pride and religious fanaticism on the wellbeing of a colonial family. If that were the case I would of rated it far higher. As it is however, presented as a horror movie, I give this film 4 stars out of ten.",3,1,5,27 February 2016
Life," Bait and switch!
","This movie reminds me of Godzilla 2014, Ryan Reynolds is stuck all over the trailer and then is only in like 20 minutes of the film. Annoying as the only reason I went to see it was because he had top billing. Also there are a lot of inconsistencies and plot holes galore. It actually made me angry with how dumb and coincidental everything is. The creature starts off looking good in the beginning but by the end it just looks ridiculous. Like they ran out of budget. Throw in a stupid 'twist' ending and yeah it was a huge letdown. Not recommended.",3,11,25,25 March 2017
