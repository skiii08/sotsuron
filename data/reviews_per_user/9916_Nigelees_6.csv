Frost_Nixon," Entering Sparing Match
","An interesting take on a subject we all know the outcome of but good to see the background. I wasn't aware of John Birt's role in the scheme as he later became better known as the Director General of the BBC. The film is a classic David (literally) and Goliath contest in which Nixon clearly underestimates his opponent who (if the film is to be believed) doesn't actually wake up to the fact that he is dealing with a consummate manipulator until it's nearly too late. Nixon, played superbly by Frank Langella is an interesting contrast to the portrayal of 'Tricky Dicky' by Anthony Hopkins in 'NIXON'. Langella gave a less credible impression of Nixon but I think gave us a more incisive view of his character. The most intriguing aspect was the boxing match analogy with the underdog most definitely coming out on top. However, you almost felt that by the end of the film Nixon was desperate to unburden his soul and came away from the process in a better frame of mind, as was depicted in the 'Italian Shoe scene'. Altogether a really well crafted film as we have come to expect from Ron Howard and full marks for the Casting Director as all the cast were excellent, especially the leads. Five Oscar Nominations but none in the bag is a pity, particularly for Langella but 2009 was a good year for leading men.",9,0,0,11 February 2012
Midnight in Paris," Shallow and Unconvincing
","I am astounded that this film is amongst the Oscar nominees for 2012. If there was a category for Best Travel Film it would win hands down as the cinematography is first class in its depiction of Paris. But the plot is so shallow as to be transparent. The characters are likewise and define the term clich√©. Owen Wilsons whiney portrayal of what is clearly supposed to be Woody Allen himself is irritating in the extreme, except when he puts Michael Sheens character in his place with a critique of a Picasso painting, which I admit was the highlight of the film. I am aware of Allens politics but surely he is more intelligent than hitting us over the head with his obscenely wealthy American 'sledgehammer' of a Republican family. The film is worth the nomination for Art Direction but the other three nominations are undeserved and to think that this sorry apology of a film has been nominated for best film when Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy has been overlooked is nothing short of scandalous. If you want some good shots of Paris see the film otherwise pass it by.",4,36,58,5 February 2012
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Intelligent thriller
","What a superb film. The feel of the 'time' was captured wonderfully, so much so you could smell the cigarette smoke. This is a film which requires a large degree of investment from the viewer as you cannot miss a scene, do so and you will be lost. You need to be tuned in to the fact that this was the end of the Cold War and all the protagonists were looking towards a very unsure future, all of which adds to the underlying paranoia. But the clear winner for me was the outstanding performance of Gary Oldman - measured, understated sheer brilliance. It's not just what he says its what he doesn't say that is marks his performance: its the gestures, the glances and the silence, yes the silence which at times is deafening. It is amazing to me that this is his first Oscar nomination for best actor. Compare this performance with LEON and particularly STATE OF GRACE which are totally different but serve to emphasize the versatility of his acting talent. Good luck Gary for the Oscars. Go and see this film but be prepared to 'pay attention'!",9,0,1,10 February 2012
American Hustle," Disappointed
","In view of the ratings here on IMDb, the high number of Oscar nominations, and the stellar cast, I was really looking forward to seeing this film. Well, all I can say is that I was totally disappointed. The story had so much potential and it was not exploited in any way. On a similar theme, I have seen better episodes of Hustle and Leverage than this film. Also what was the 'bad hair' theme all about as there were a number of characters with real hair issues and none of it 'false' all real - weird. After about an hour in to this my wife and I looked at each other and said 'I thought it was me' and we were pleased that we'd both come to the same conclusion. All in all, if you really want to see this film view it objectively and forget the hype and hopefully you won't been so disappointed afterwards.",5,6,10,30 January 2014
Children of Men," I just don't get it!
",Yet again the ranking in IMDb has foxed me. How on earth has this film achieved such acclaim. The premise of the story was good but got tangled up in Christian analogy and political farce. Michael Caine was totally miscast and performed as Michael Caine as he does in almost all his movies. Clive Owen looked completely lost (or perhaps he was supposed to be) and Pam Ferris - well what can I say. Yes the cinematography was OK but there are so many other better examples of 'hand held' out there. Please view the film and make up your own mind but please open your mind and don't let the 'best' reviews colour your judgement. Very disappointing.,2,14,22,26 May 2010
Spectre," Steer clear of this turkey
","I have just watched the new Bond offering - please please will someone put this franchise out of its misery as it is well past its sell by date. Everyone knows that when you see a Bond film much is formulaic but in this case it is just plain old tired. The plot is pedestrian, the acting (such as it is) is dire and the directing - well Mendes needs to run a mile away from the next one and stick to what he's good at. Daniel Craig has done some good work in his career but I'm sure this has to be his worst and I trust he won't be doing the next one. The whole film is such a crushing bore I would rather watch paint dry than even think about watching it again. Please don't waste two and a half hours of your life and steer clear of this turkey.",1,14,27,6 March 2016
