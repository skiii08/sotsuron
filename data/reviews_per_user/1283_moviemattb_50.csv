The Blair Witch Project," My absolute favorite of the found footage genre
","'The Blair Witch Project' is a found footage movie that documents the missing three student filmmakers for disappearing into the woods near at Burkittsville, Maryland as they were shooting a documentary about the Blair Witch as it appears to be a legend. A year later their footage was found. Everyone hated this movie because its not about how shaky the camera was, but how they were extremely disappointed that the movie was not real; they all thought this was for real when they were stuffs about the three missing students, and most of all the Blair Witch that does exist in our world. I understand this movie is not real, but did it need to be? No. It does not need to be real because if it did, then it might as well ended up as a snuff film and that is not good. No one wants to see a movie that happens to be real, where they get lost into the woods and ended up being killed. That is completely stupid! I have never seen a snuff film, and I am not sure if I want to see one. I might as well not want to. I enjoy this movie for what it is! It may look like real footage, but it is not real. With that said, 'The Blair Witch Project' is one of the most effective horror movies ever made, and it is not only one of my favorite horror movies but it is my absolute favorite of the found footage genre. I do enjoy other found footage movies such as 'Cloverfield;' 'Chronicle;' 'Zero Day;' and the 'Paranormal Activity' movies. The majority of the movie works so well to not include any music as it makes it very effective. However, it does appear at the film's end credits where it plays that strange creepy soundtrack that plays with all of this creepy sound as you hear something unusual. Tony Cora did that music piece for the film's credits, I thought he did great job for creating something as what I said previously unusual. The three main actors Heather Donahue; Joshua Leonard; and Michael Williams all do a wonderful job for playing themselves in a fictional way as if they were filmmakers. When I watch this movie, I get a sense of feeling that I was actually with those three and did ending up with them for getting lost into the woods; it almost like virtual reality and you feel like that you are actually there. I give credit for both Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez for writing a great story, and directing for what they had envision it; as well as editing it. To those that hate this movie, I suggest that you should give this movie another shot, and maybe understand the movie better for what it is; also, to those that may have not seen the movie, I say check it out because it feels like an experience. I highly recommend 'The Blair Witch Project,' and I give it a 10 out of 10.",10,1,5,31 October 2014
Mission: Impossible III," Outstanding Film Debut for J.J. Abrams
","J.J. Abrams is well known for his two popular TV shows like 'Alias' and 'Lost,' as well as directing the first two 'Star Trek' movies and my favorite of his 'Super 8;' now he is off to direct the new 'Star Wars' movie and I'm not so sure about it. I'll just have to wait and see. With that said, 'Mission: Impossible III' is about Ethan Hunt who is now enjoying with the love of his life Julia Meade as he receives a messages from the IMF to have him come back on the force as he brings his team to track down Owen Davian as they are wanting to know about the 'Rabbit's Foot.' Moreover, Julia gets kidnap by Davian as Ethan tries to get her back for whatever it takes to stop Davian for killing her. As far as this is Abrams' film debut, its actually quite outstanding. I thought the premise of the movie is a step up from the second movie, and it really does keep me going as the movie goes. The action in this movie is really good, and I don't think its has some of that jumpy editing or the camera being shaky. I can see perfectly fine on what is going on. The cast in this movie all did great. Tom Cruise is still Ethan Hunt, and still being awesome. So much praise for Cruise, if you ask me. Philip Seymour Hoffman does a great job for playing such a villain. I don't know if he is a three dimensional villain, but I love him anyway; it is sad that he is no longer with us, and will surely be miss. Rest in peace, Philip Seymour Hoffman. Moving on, Michelle Monaghan was actually really good to play Ethan Hunt's love interest, and is probably the best female lead in a 'Mission: Impossible' movie in my humble opinion. The rest all did fine. Michael Giacchino's music and his arrangements for the theme song was fine. I don't like it as much as either Hans Zimmer's or Danny Elfman's, but its fine on its own. The movie does have some good stunt work, especially for Tom Cruise when he has to run in this movie. Quote from 'Minority Report' 'Everybody runs,' but hey he is Tom Cruise and he is always into the action. The final confrontation between Ethan and Davian was decent, but not as good as the last fight between Ethan and Sean from the second movie. I do wish if the fight was a bit longer, and I guess have Ethan not worry about the bug that is planted inside his head. Also, have a true proper death scene for Hoffman's character instead of getting hit by a truck. I don't know if you would agree with me on this one, but all I'm is saying that the final confrontation could've been a lot better. But it is to each of their own. Overall, I enjoy 'Mission: Impossible III' and I really had a heck of a fun time! I give it a 9 out of 10.",9,1,1,31 August 2015
The Sound of Music," For 50 years, the hills are still alive
","I have never saw this movie, when it first came out back in the mid- 60s but I know my mother has a VHS copy of the movie as its part of the 'Family Feature' release. Did I watch it as a kid? No. I didn't bother to watch it, and wouldn't think if this was a good movie. Of course as I became a teenager, I saw that Vin Diesel movie 'The Pacifier' from Disney as Diesel's character has to direct 'The Sound of Music' play as he still keeping eyes out on the children. Also, I didn't know that 'Family Guy' was making fun of the movie as I now realize as an adult that Seth Macfarlane is fan of it. Of course, the movie does have fans. So I pop in the old VHS into the VCR as I was looking at some old movies as I was into filmmaking, and after watching it I personally fell in love with this movie from beginning to end. During Christmas, my mother now has a copy of the movie for the first time on DVD for its 40th anniversary with the picture quality being upgraded. Never have the 45th anniversary edition as it was release on Blu-Ray for the first time, because I wonder if 20th Century Fox was ever going to release this movie again on Blu-Ray for its 50th anniversary, and what do you know it, they did. I got it as a birthday present, but I only watch the special features first. Haven't watch the movie yet. However, I did see the movie being reissue on the big screen by Turner Classic Movies and Fathom Events with Robert Osborne being the host for the introduction and its closure. It was my first time seeing it at a movie theater, and had an amazing experience. The opening scene Maria sings the first opening musical number brought a smile to my face, and as the movie ended I was the first one to clap as the other audiences joined in. It wasn't a huge crowd, but it was nice for others to see it. The movie is about a young Austrian woman name Maria as she is wanting to be a nun in Salzburg at the abbey. So the Reverend Mother gives her a task to be a governess as she is suppose to take care of Captain Von Trapp's seven children. While she takes care of the children by teaching them how to sing, she also brings love to the family as the Captain fells in love in Maria as they got marry and leave their home behind as the Nazis take over Austria. The movie is based on not only the musical Broadway, but it is also based on a German movie 'Die Trapp-Familie' and the true story of Maria and her family. There are not much words to say about this movie, because everyone has already love this movie and already know what is so great about it. I really love the story as it is told brilliantly. The direction by Robert Wise is outstanding as he knows how to tell a good story, and bringing characters to life. The cast in this movie are wonderful. The children all did well on their own as Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews are both wonderful for their performances as well as the chemistry they made. The songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein are a whole lot of fun to listen to as well as Irwin Kostal's take on the score. The movie does have its beautiful cinematography as I indeed love the look of Salzburg, Austria. The movie does have its funny moments, while its other moments are touching and heartwarming. The movie is almost three hour long, but I never got bored with it as the pacing of the movie keeps me going. Lastly, it does have great message as the movie tells where you have the Reverend Mother tell Maria not to be afraid, but must face her own destiny by faith and courage. That is what the spirit is for the movie as like myself, I must face my own choice of destiny by courage as well as my faith in God. I know anyone may identify for where the message of the movie comes from. So that is how much I love this movie, and I am glad that for 50 years, the hills are still alive. 'The Sound of Music' continues to be a beloved classic, and it will always be a beloved classic. I give it a perfect powerhouse 10 out of 10.",10,2,8,23 April 2015
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Happy 35th Anniversary To One Of The Greatest Adventure Films Of All Time!
","'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is my second favorite movie next to 'Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope,' and it is also, in my opinion, my absolute favorite movie by Steven Spielberg. Spielberg teams up with George Lucas after his success with 'Star Wars' as both of the greatest filmmakers had set out to pay homage to the old serials of the 1930s. The movie is about an archaeologist and professor name, Indiana Jones as he goes on an adventure to search for the Ark of the Covenant with the help of the love of his life Marion Ravenwood. However, Indy's rival Rene Belloq has been working with the Nazis as they both go after the Ark, and it is up to Indy to retrieve the Ark before its too late. It has been 35 years, since this movie came out back in 1981 and it still is my favorite of the series. The series itself may have pay respect to the 'James Bond' movies, but they also pay tributes to the old serials of the 1930s until the fourth one pays tribute of the 1950s sci-fi B movies. With that said, whenever I watch this movie, it never feels dated nor is it cheesy. Like the 'Star Wars' series, you will always feel the experience as you go on for the ride as the 'Indiana Jones' series explore exotic locations and search for artifacts. By getting to the point, Harrison Ford is definitely Indiana Jones as he is as Han Solo. He does a brilliant job with the role as his character is someone that you don't want to mess with because he is rough, cool and is always amazed when he is discovering artifacts. Of course, he is always into as I quote from the second movie 'Fortune and Glory.' Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood is my favorite of all the girls that Indy has met in his life. Not only is she beautiful, but she can be also feisty too. Sometimes she be a damsel in distress, but she never whines and complain like Willie Scott did in the second movie. Her character is pretty complex as you learn about her as she and Indy did had some history together as she had romantic affair with him. Paul Freeman as Belloq is a really good villain, and quite a rivalry to Indy as they are always after the same artifact as they're trying to retrieve. The rest of the cast all did well. Steven Spielberg does an amazing job on directing the movie with George Lucas coming up with this brilliant concept that he had created. Lawrence Kasdan has wrote a brilliant script, and the story itself always kept me investing as well as the characters. The special effects by Industrial Light & Magic are absolutely fantastic for its used of practical effects, matte paintings and miniature work. John Williams' music is completely unforgettable, and there is no denying that the theme he created would be as iconic as the 'Star Wars' theme. The action scenes are very well done as well as the physical work that were put on camera. The cinematography by Douglas Slocombe is also wonderful as I do get a sense of the 1930s, which it does put me in the right atmosphere. The humor is done well, for example, Indy has an Arab Swordsman in his way as you think there is going to be fight between them, instead Indy just shoots him because he has no time for that. The movie is also very well putted together, and it does go by at a very good pace. I never see any flaws with this movie, because this movie is definitely flawless, and it will always be either one of the greatest or the greatest adventure films of all time. 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is a classic adventure film, and I am giving it a 10 out of 10.",10,1,2,3 May 2016
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," A Love Letter
","What I mean by the title that I put in my review is that 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' is a love letter for how much we love watching cartoons, when we were growing up as we were once kids. The cartoons that we all love like the Disney Cartoons with Mickey Mouse; Donald Duck; Goofy and many other Disney characters. As for Warner Bros. Cartoons, Bugs Bunny; Daffy Duck; Porky Pig; and many other characters from Looney Tunes. This movie just wants to put a smile on our faces. I cannot go into much detail about this movie because you already know about this movie and how wonderful it is. Bob Hoskins was absolutely terrific as Eddie Valiant as well as Christopher Lloyd as Judge Doom. Charles Fleischer is and shall always be remember as Roger Rabbit. He is likable, and a lot fun to watch him. The special effects in this movie are amazing for its mixture of live action and animation. Robert Zemeckis' direction is without of doubt outstanding. Alan Silvestri's score is well done. The story is also well written, but won't go into much detail about it. I love it before, and still love it today at this very moment. Its fun, exciting, entertaining,and its a whole lot of fun to watch! I give 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' a 10 out of 10.",10,1,1,15 November 2014
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Terrible spin-off from the X-Men series, but its watchable
","Five years ago, I used to love this movie and thought it can be better than other super hero spin-offs. Now, by looking back at this movie, it does not hold up really well. I can now see what went wrong with this movie, but I don't hated it. There are some things that I do like about 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine,' while the rest I have issues with. Hugh Jackman does a fantastic job as the Wolverine, and he does make this movie worth watching because he is the Wolverine. Some of the cast like Liev Schreiber, Danny Huston, Lynn Collins, Taylor Kitsch, and such did fine for what they have to do. I thought the music by Harry Gregson Williams isn't that bad, but not one of the greatest that I've ever heard. Some of the action is bit standard, but that does not mean they are bad. With that said, the origin story for our main character isn't well told which they tried to make it a decent character study, but it was poorly executed. Nevertheless, I at least give it some credit for trying. The special effects in this movie are downright terrible. Wolverine's claws in the other X-Men movies were practical, but now they are CG. Thankfully, they went back to practical on the other Wolverine movie which that one is better than this movie. The script is poorly written, and could have use some rewrites before making this movie. The time frame is mess up in this movie because the movie is suppose to be taken place in the late 1970s and early 80s, but the movie acts like if this was today. There are plot holes in this movie, and they don't make any sense. First, those computers in the movie don't exist like this until the today's technology; second, they put Gambit in this movie, but what will happen to him when he joins part of the X-Men? He will become in older man, and third, did most of the people who were behind this movie ever read the comics? I don't think so. Once again, I can now see what's wrong with this movie and wish that the script deserves some rewrites, and make it a better movie. If you want see a better Wolverine movie, then watch 'The Wolverine.' James Mangold made that the better Wolverine than what Gavin Hood did with this movie. This is a terrible spin-off from the X-Men series, but its watchable. I give 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' a 4 out of 10. Oh, and one more thing, I do hope that 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' fixes up the time frame, and I will be looking forward to it when it comes to theaters on May 23rd.",4,0,1,17 May 2014
Ed Wood," A Genuine Classic Movie of the 90s
","Edward D. Wood, Jr. was hailed as the worst director of all time, and was famous for making horrible movies such as 'Glen or Glenda;' 'Bride of the Monster;' 'Plan 9 from Outer Space;' and many other movies that he has made. He works so fast, and never gives up his dreams as he continues to make movies. There have been many fans who enjoy watching movies that are suppose to be bad they are really good. Of course, I enjoy some of Wood's movies and some of the other bad movies that are not directed by Ed Wood like 'Sharknado;' 'Troll 2;' and many others. Now, in the mid-90s, there was a movie about Ed Wood and it was famously directed by none other than Tim Burton. Burton was perfect for this biopic on the world's worst director, and he actually succeed it for what he had envisioned for this movie. Johnny Depp was wonderfully superb as Ed Wood, while Martin Landau was absolutely sensational for playing the star of 'Dracula,' Bela Lugosi. The makeup design by Rick Baker was top notch perfect; the music by Howard Shore was well done, and the film's cinematography was brilliantly shot in black and white. It works so well because most of Wood's movies in the 50s were filmed in black and white. I understand that the movie is not really 100 percent well accurate, but it didn't bother me at all. I still enjoy the movie for what it is, and I wouldn't be upset about this movies if it is whether or not accurate. Nevertheless, it does have a great message when it comes to filmmaking because making movies is not really easy and it cannot always be about the big picture that it will always turn out to be a hit at the box-office, nor saying that it has something to do about the money. I, on the other hand, will never take that kind of route when I am making movies of my own. I make movies by showing the best of my efforts without trying to be a snob or just rushing my movies to get things done. We, as filmmakers, should always take our time and effort as we fully realized our visions for what movies that we want to make. Of course, there will be times that we do get a bunch of bad rep by critics, and we will always have to accept the responsibilities of criticism. We are not always that perfect, and we can't always say nasty things to the critics that our movies are perfect. I know I do enjoy working on some of the movies that I make during my years in junior high school and high school but I am always aware of some of the problems that I had when I am making movies. If they are not as perfect as I hope for, then there is no need to get upset about. We always make mistakes, but we can learned from them as we continue to make good movies and maybe there can be a possibility to make a movie that is perfect. Remember, whenever you are making a movie that you are making, there will always be times that your movies can come out being brilliant or just end up being a disaster. It does take quite a risk for making a movie and we always have to expected for being good; some times your movies can get good reviews and some times your movies can get bad reviews. Whether you have a hit or a flop, all you do is just try to keep up the good work and give out your very best. That is what it takes when it comes to filmmaking. This movie is very important to me because I always want to take notes from it so I can make my movies really good, and not having it to come out as a piece of garbage. Heck, this can be important to you too if you are into the filmmaking business. 'Ed Wood' is a genuine classic movie of the 90s, and it shall always be one of my favorite movies. I give 'Ed Wood' a 10 out of 10.",10,3,3,13 October 2014
Home Alone," An Unforgettable Christmas Classic
","'Home Alone' is about a boy name Kevin McCallister who is left behind with his family that they have gone to Paris as he takes care of the house, and deal with some burglars. I grew up with this movie as it is part of my childhood, and it is still fun to watch from being a kid to an adult. This is one of my favorite Christmas movies, and I do watch it when it comes to the Christmas holidays. John Hughes' script is extremely well written as well as Chris Columbus' direction. John Williams' music is so memorable and beautiful at the same time. The cast in this movie were great, but I give highly praises to Macaulay Culkin for his performance as the main lead. He is star of this whole movie, and fun to watch. Also, I give highly praises to Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern as Harry and Marv who they are known as the Wet Bandits. The movie is filled with slapstick like 'The Three Stooges,' when Kevin sets up the traps as both Harry and Marv go through a lot of pain as the movie goes toward the end. The movie is not only funny, but it has a lot of heart to it that is filled with the spirit of Christmas. This is the best of all the 'Home Alone' movies, and nothing beats them. The only good sequel is the second, which I will get to that later but the third and fourth were terrible; they tried to be fun and entertaining, but they were not and they were not needed to be made. So, anyway, 'Home Alone' is definitely the one to watch during the Christmas holidays as well as the second, which again, I will get to that later. If you haven't seen the first 'Home Alone' movie, please feel free to check it out because it is fun, entertaining and it really does have that Christmas feeling. When you finish watching the movie toward the end credits, you come out feeling good at the end of it. 'Home Alone' is definitely an unforgettable Christmas classic, and I give it a 10 out of 10.",10,0,1,16 December 2014
The Terminator," A Classic Movie Of The 80s That Mixes With Action, Horror, And Science Fiction
","'The Terminator' is one of the most popular movies that was made back in the mid-80s, and it has been well-remembered by critics and audiences alike. Everyone has seen this movies and knows it quite well as much as its famous sequel 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day.' I don't know if I had anything new to say about this movie because everyone already knows well about 'The Terminator' and why its so darn good about it. This movie was directed by James Cameron who would go on to make the second 'Terminator' movie along with the second 'Alien' movie, 'The Abyss,' 'True Lies,' 'Titanic,' and now 'Avatar.' I know that Cameron considered this movie to be his first film because his previous film 'Piranha II: The Spawning,' was going to be but some random people of the movie took over and wasn't like the way the Cameron envision it. So he just ignores that movie and considers 'The Terminator' as his first film because he had more control than he had with the second 'Piranha' movie. The movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator, which it was his first time to play a villain and he really does a fascinating job to not only he embodied the character, but making it such a memorable role. He is the Terminator. Michael Biehn was also great as Kyle Reese along side with Linda Hamilton as John Connor's mother Sarah. The movie really does go at a really good pace, and it does keep you on the edge of your seat. The music by Brad Fiedel is one of the greatest scores that has ever been heard in this kind of movie with the use of synthesizer, and featuring the famous 'Terminator Theme.' The special effects in this movie are really good in this movie, especially with the design of the Terminator by the great Stan Winston. The effects are no 'Terminator 2,' but they are still really good before there was any CGI as what most filmmakers are using by today's special effects. The story is really well told and very effective as the premise goes along without any subplots or any of that mumble jumble. All it is that one is really trying to protect Sarah Connor, while the other to terminate and that is all you need for a story like this. 'The Terminator' is a classic movie of the 80s that mixes with action, horror, and science fiction. If you haven't seen this movie, check it out! I give this movie a 10 out of 10.",10,5,6,19 August 2014
Ready Player One," Ready Player One Is Roger Rabbit For A New Generation!
","When I first the trailer from Comic Con, I just got completely hooked and have never felt this much hyped on Steven Spielberg movie in such a long time. After making some drama movies, Spielberg was able to return on making fun entertaining movies again, like when he made movies that were fun such as 'Jaws,' 'Hook,' 'Jurassic Park,' 'Minority Report,' and many to count. The movie itself is based on a book by Ernest Cline while he co writes it with Zak Penn, as the movie itself is about a teenage boy name Wade Watts as he lived his life at the stacks in Columbus, Ohio. He has a huge admiration of James Halliday, the creator of a place that takes inside virtual reality called the OASIS, where everyone can do all the things they want to and it is filled with many pop cultures references as it deals with movies, video games, 70s and 80s music, and more. Watts goes into the OASIS as his avatar Parzival, where he comes across with some friends he meets and has a crush on girl name Samantha Cook and her avatar Art3mis. However, an evil cooperate name Nolan Sorrento as he is trying to take over the OASIS, while finding an Easter Egg that Halliday has hidden. So Wade and his friends must save the OASIS, and retrieve the Easter Egg before it gets into the wrong hands. Before I continue, this will not contain any spoilers as the movie had just come out a while go, so I rather you go see it without ruining the surprises. This movie is filled with surprises, and really had such a fun time to see this on the biggest screen as possible. I thought the story that I describe it, may sound similar about good guys stopping the bad guys before getting into the wrong hands, but for what it is I think it is told well for what it needs to be. The characters as I'll admit, there are some moments where you a know bit about their backstory (particularly Wade's and Samantha's), but not develop enough. Despite this, they're still likable, and I do have some relations to Wade's character, as he is like me that he really admires Halliday for being one of his idols and learning so much history about him as he has so much love for nostalgia. For me, I have so much an admiration for some of my favorite filmmakers like Spielberg, for example, as he has a love for making movie and always has a passion for telling stories, and getting to know about the characters. Wade is somewhat relatable, and nothing more I can say about. The cast in this movie all did great. For the adults, Mark Rylance, Ben Mendelsohn, and Simon Pegg have all given very good performances, but for the young actors Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke are outstanding, as they both have a really great chemistry, and the romance is somewhat sweet. For Alan Silvestri, I thought his music was really good, and I think I can barely hear the 'Back to the Future,' when the Delorean pops up. Made need to listen to the score as I bought it off on iTunes and I can't wait to listen to that. Sure it would've been interesting for Spielberg's longtime composer John Williams to do the music, but Silvestri isn't a bad choice. The action in this movie are exciting, and really enjoy hearing some familiar songs that appeared in the movie. Especially hearing the song 'Jump' by Van Halen, when it was heard in the 2nd trailer. The special effects are terrific, and the mo-cap work here is top notch. I really did enjoy seeing the references in the movie like the Delorean, the bike from 'Akira,' Batman, and of course and probably the best one is seeing the Iron Giant kicking butt. Before I end my review, I just want to bring up that the movie is very different from the book. I have read it twice, and really love it, but there some portions that the movie strays away from. So if you are expecting to be more like the book,then you'll be disappointed and won't accept any of the changes they made. If you want it to be different from the book, then you will have a great time. The movie is definetly a love letter to pop culture as well as 80s nostalgia. Also, it really does have a nice heart to it, and I am more than happy for Spielberg as he had to accomplish for taking such a challenge on how to adapt this book into a movie that deals with pop culture. What you know it? He nailed it! For the movie, not only is it going to be in my top favorite movies of 2018, but in my top favorite Spielberg movies. And another thing, when Hollywood adapts popular video games into a movie, they pretty much failed on every level, but this movie is probably going to be one of the best if not the best video game movie of all time. In conclusion, 'Ready Player One' is Roger Rabbit for a new generation, and you are going to have a wonderful time at the movies. I am giving it a 10 out of 10.",10,1,6,30 April 2018
The Polar Express," A Wonderful Experience
","I think this movie deserves a higher rating than a 6.6 on IMDb. I know its just an opinion to everyone else, but I just don't think it deserves to be ignored because 'The Polar Express' is one of the greatest experience that I have ever seen, since when it first came out back in 2004 in IMAX 3D. My favorite part in IMAX 3D is where the train starts to go too fast, and we get this awesome experience that you are on a roller coaster ride. I felt like that I was part of that ride, and it was like 'WOW!' Of course, I am only watching this in 2D which is fine but it will never be the same experience as what the IMAX 3D did. So, with that said, 'The Polar Express' is about a boy who doesn't believe as he gets on a magical train known as the Polar Express as it leads up to the North Pole so he and the rest of the children are about to go see Santa Claus on Christmas Eve late at night. I don't know if the movie has a message but if it does, then I thought it is well done as we should know that seeing is believing as it for us on what we believe. The animation in this movie is spectacular, and I thought the animators did a great job on rendering these characters to make them look real. Of course, you can argue about on why Robert Zemeckis should have just shot this movie in live action instead of animating it. So, what do I know because I honestly don't know; maybe it is just for that kind of style as they are trying to make these characters to be more faithful to the book. Anyway, I thought Zemeckis does a great job on making this movie, and making this a whole lot of fun. Tom Hanks does a wonderful job to work with motion capture as he is playing each character that he is doing; it is also kind of hard on which actor or actress is voicing these characters or doing motion capture but I will leave that up to you. Nevertheless, Hanks was really good in it. The music by Alan Silvestri is very well scored, and the songs that he teamed up with Glen Ballard are pretty good too. I also don't mind if the filmmakers had to add new scenes that have nothing to do with the book, because folks, the book is short so that is probably why they had to expand the book into a movie that is over an hour an a half long. I was fine with it, and have nothing to complain about. So, enough talking about who or what is having problems with this movie, I just thought 'The Polar Express' is a wonderful experience and would love if this was brought back into theaters, as well as showing it in IMAX 3D. I give this movie a 10 out of 10.",10,21,27,24 December 2014
Interstellar," The 2001: A Space Odyssey of our Time
","I won't go into spoiler territory about this movie, because you have to see it. I thought 'Interstellar' is a wonderful movie, and I do wish if I ever saw this movie in IMAX but seeing it in a regular theater was better than nothing. I hope I get to see the IMAX footage, once it comes to DVD and Blu Ray. So, with that said, I thought Christopher Nolan does a fantastic job on directing the movie as well as writing it with his brother Jonathan Nolan. The special effects in this movie are breathtaking with the use of its mixture of practical and CGI effects. Hans Zimmer's music is really wonderful, and there were parts of the music where it does make you think of the music in Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey.' The cinematography is so beautifully well shot, and I thought the cast did great. Matthew McConaughey does a great job as the main lead, while Anne Hathaway; Jessica Chastain; Mackenzie Foy and Michael Caine were all great in their own roles. The movie is also very well paced, and the movie does have that sort of realism where you can realize on what space is like besides another great movie about space, and that movie is of course 'Gravity.' I will admit that the ending was weak, but its by no means terrible or anything spectacular; it just is for what it is. 'Interstellar' is definitely a work of art, and this is the '2001: A Space Odyssey' of our time. I highly recommend this movie, and it is definitely a must see! I don't know what is my number one favorite movie of 2014, but I know that 'Interstellar' is really on my best films of 2014 list. If you don't like this movie, I will respect that but I just couldn't help myself on how wonderful 'Interstellar' really is, and really do wish if I ever see this movie in IMAX. I could be surprise if they reissue this movie back in to theaters and IMAX for another viewing. So, that is all I got to say about 'Interstellar' and I give this movie a 10 out of 10. Really love this movie!",10,0,4,2 January 2015
Predator," Pure Action, Horror, Sci-Fi, and Schwarzenegger
","'Predator' has been a childhood of mine, as our eldest brother show us this movie on FX, then one time when he got himself a copy of the movie on DVD, and we all love it from beginning to end. The movie is about a group of soldiers as they go into the jungle to look for some hostages, until one of its members set them up, and then come across of an extraterrestrial, that is hunting for sport and begins to slaughter them one by one. So its up to Dutch, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger as he must face the Predator alone, in order to survive by becoming the ultimate warrior. I don't what else to say that hasn't already been said, but everyone knows this movie and it definetly gets so much to talk about as this is the most quotable and most memorable movie of all time. It has a lot of memorable one liners with fantastic action set pieces, and at the same time its really suspenseful. The film is like 106 minutes, and never was I bored by it. The cast all did great, where they may not be 3 noted, but they at least have a strong presence. Schwarzenegger, alongside with Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Sonny Landham, Richard Chaves, Shane Black, and Jesse Ventura are all great together, and you really do buy them for the roles they were given. They're also likable too. Kevin Peter Hall is also really good as the Predator for the way he moves, and the way acts. The special effects, and the Predator design by Stan Winston is fantastic. John McTiernan, who would go on to direct 'Die Hard' 1 and 3 has made a fun movie, and really knows how to do the action scenes really well. The atmosphere in this movie is really strong, and love the setting that this movie takes place in the jungle. Alan Silvestri's music is really unforgettable, and definetly one of his best scores. I could go on more about this movie, but if you haven't seen 'Predator,' I say check it out; its definetly pure action, horror, sci-fi, and Schwarzenegger. I am giving this classic Schwarzenegger movie a 10 out of 10.",10,4,5,14 October 2018
Man of Steel," Man of Steel is Zack Snyder's Best Film
","'Man of Steel' is without a doubt one of Zack Snyder's best film. Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy his other movies '300' and 'Watchmen,' and they are both well made movies. 'Sucker Punch,' on the other hand, not really. So, why do I consider this movie to be Snyder's best film? Well, I guess you can say that I am more familiar with Superman than any other comic book characters that appeared on film or television. Although, I do prefer Batman because he has always been my personal favorite superhero, but let's not get into that. 'Man of Steel' is one of those films that I can watch and never get tired of it. I do enjoy the reinterpretation of Superman for not being dark and realistic, but showing the human side of him. Henry Cavill does a wonderful job for portraying the character on its own than just acting like some of the other actors that had already portray him. Amy Adams, at first, I wasn't sure how she can pull her role off, but as I saw her on screen she really is Lois Lane. I really love how she updated her for not making her a damsel in distress, which is a good thing. Also, I do like that she is able to do something rather than just screaming for Superman to be saved. Nothing much on Michael Shannon's take on General Zod, but I do say that he was really good to play such a villain. The other actors like Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent, Diane Lane as Martha Kent, Laurence Fishburne as Perry White, and Russell Crowe as Jor-El do there jobs well enough. I thought Hans Zimmer's score was brilliant. His score does capture for the film's tone, and doing his own theme besides doing the classic Superman theme by John Williams. I also do like to point out that it is cool to have Christopher Nolan on board as producer after coming his success with 'The Dark Knight Trilogy,' which they are awesome movies. I will admit that the origin did not need to be told again, but nevertheless, it is really well told on its own. The action in this movie is awesome. Its like 'Dragon Ball Z,' but even better than that despicable movie 'Dragon Ball Evolution.' I know there are people out there who don't like this movie as well as the critics. Honestly, I don't care what they have to say. I know is their opinion, but we can agree to disagree. I can defend this movie as much as I want, but I digress. 'Man of Steel' is an awesome movie, and I give it a 10 out of 10.",10,3,6,2 May 2014
North by Northwest," A Suspenseful Spy Thriller by The Master of Suspense
","'North by Northwest' is definitely one of my favorite movies by Alfred Hitchcock. He is a pretty darn good filmmaker who knows how to tell a story and where to point the camera at. The movie is about Roger Thornhill, an advertising executive, who has been kidnapped by Phillip Vandamm and his men by a mistaken identity George Kaplan who doesn't exist. So Thornhill has been wrongfully accused as a fugitive and pursed himself across the country. I thought the cast in this movie did wonderful. Cary Grant does a remarkable job for his performance for being funny, confused, and being likable. Eva Marie Saint was lovely in this movie and she was fascinating. James Mason and a young Martin Landau were terrific for playing their roles as the villains. Bernard Herrmann's score was outstanding for creating music for suspense, romance, and excitement. The cinematography in this movie is beautifully shot, and the cornfield scene where Thornhill is being attacked by an airplane is well done. Give thanks to the Master of Suspense for making such an exciting movie. I give 'North by Northwest' a 10 out of 10.",10,2,4,4 May 2014
Edward Scissorhands," A Wonderful Fairy Tale
","Tim Burton had made three great movies during the 80s such as 'Pee Wee's Big Adventure;' 'Beetlejuice;' and 'Batman.' Now as we enter in the 90s, Burton makes a movie about a man with his hands that are razor sharp scissors and my thoughts on the movie was wonderful. 'Edward Scissorhands' is a wonderful fairy tale that is Gothic; funny; sad; and totally original. This is the first movie that Burton collaborates with Johnny Depp before they go on to make movies together such as 'Ed Wood;' 'Sleepy Hollow;' 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory;' 'Corpse Bride;' 'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street;' 'Alice in Wonderland;' and so far 'Dark Shadows.' Don't know what they will work on next. I know everyone gets sick of Burton for casting Depp and Burton's wife Helena Bonham Carter to be in movies together, but I have no issues with that whatsoever. Anyway, I thought Depp did such a fascinating job for playing the main character of the film's premise. Also, I thought Winona Ryder was really good in her role as Edward's love interest. Anthony Michael Hall and the rest of the cast all did great. I thought Danny Elfman's music was beautifully well scored, and I thought the look of Depp's character is extremely well done. I don't have any problems with the movie, but I know that this movie is one of Burton's greatest achievements. I give 'Edward Scissorhands' a 10 out of 10. Check it out!",10,2,3,12 October 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man," 'The Amazing Spider-Man' is pretty good
","In honor for the the release of 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2,' I decided to review this before going to see the sequel. So, with that said, here is my review. Five years after 'Spider-Man 3' came out, which it received mixed reaction by critics and fans alike Sam Raimi and the rest of cast of the original three movies decided to leave the franchise, and have Sony reboot it with a new director and a new set of cast. Marc Webb, director of one of my favorite movies of 2009 500 Days of Summer comes in to direct along with Andrew Garfield taking over the role of Spider-Man and his alter ego Peter Parker. I did go see this movie in theaters, and I really like it. However, I don't love it as much as what others say. You want to know why? Well, I wasn't really that much fond of rebooting series and have Sam Raimi along with the original cast leave the franchise, and not do a fourth Spider-Man movie. I understand that 'Spider-Man 3' left many comic book fans disappointed, and consider to be the worst of the series. To me, I don't hate 'Spider-Man 3' as what they said. I can see what were the problems in that movie, but I still have so fun with it and I do wish if there was a 'Spider-Man 4.' Raimi did said that he was unhappy with the results, but does not hated it; he also said that he wanted go back to basics like what the original first two movies were. The unmade fourth movie was going to feature the Lizard or Vulture in this movie, and maybe feature Felicia Hardy as the Black Cat; although they were going to make her as the Vulturess instead which it sounds lame, but they can at least rewrite it and make her the Black Cat as the character should be. But nope, the people at Sony decided to reboot the franchise instead of continuing it. So much of the disagreements between Sony and Raimi had. I still would've love see 'Spider-Man 4' happening, but nevertheless, I did accepted it as a conclusion for Sam Raimi's trilogy. So that is one of the problems that I had with 'The Amazing Spider-Man.' Also, I thought James Horner's score along with the Spider Man theme isn't as amazing as Danny Elfman's; its not bad though, but its not one of my favorites. Lastly, we don't need to tell Spider-Man's origin story again. I understand why it needed to be told because we never see Peter Parker's parents in the original movies, and trying to make Uncle Ben's killer right because of what happened in 'Spider-Man 3.' It is well told, but it still doesn't need to be told again. The movie itself is almost like watching the original first Spider-Man movie all over again, and it makes you wonder what is the point. If they just take out the origin, then maybe the movie would be a little better. So those are my problems with the movie. Despite some of the flaws that I mention, I did thought that Marc Webb had done a terrific job on directing the movie, while Andrew Garfield does a great job to play both Spider-Man and Peter Parker. No need to compare which Spider-Man is better because I enjoy Garfield's and Tobey Maguire's for each of their own take. Emma Stone I will admit is a much better Gwen Stacey than what Bryce Dallas Howard did in 'Spider-Man 3.' Howard is okay, but I prefer Stone's more. The relationship between Peter and Gwen is quite good, but I rather much prefer Peter and Mary Jane because that is how I remember as a kid growing up when there was the 1994 animated series. Martin Sheen and Sally Field were great as Peter's uncle and aunt, while Rhys Ifans does a fine job as the Lizard. The special effects are pretty darn good. The suit that Spider-Man wore is not bad, but I prefer the old suit in the original movies more. The action scenes were fine, but there is nothing spectacular about it. So that is all I got to say about whats good and bad about it. 'The Amazing Spider-Man' is pretty good, and I give it an 8 out of 10. Seriously, I still wish if there was a 'Spider-Man 4.'",8,0,1,19 May 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," The X-Men series is back to its original roots
","As you read my review, I will not give any spoilers whatsoever because the movie is still being shown in theaters must not give anything away for those who have not seen the movie. So I am not going to, but I do hope you enjoy reading my review. I just saw 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' in theaters, and I really love it. As you read the title of my review, you know what I am talking about; everyone had problems with the series on one thing which you probably may have read about, but now everyone does not have to worry because the movie has finally set things right. Remember I said in my review of 'The Wolverine' if 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' was going to top 'The Wolverine,' and might consider this movie that I saw in theaters might be my favorite? Well as I saw the movie in theaters, I now consider this and 'The Wolverine' as my two favorite X-Men movies of the series. I am pleased to have Bryan Singer returning in director's chair since he was absent on directing the other X-Men movies. This is probably Bryan Singer's best work for directing an X-Men besides the first two movies that he directed. The story is extremely well told, and it really does stay true the comics besides some of the changes that were made in the final cut of the movie. I am also pleased to have John Ottman returning for working on the music of the movie as he did with the second X-Men movie; he also did edit film and I thought it was well edited. The cast in this movies was incredible. I thought it was cool to have the original cast meeting with the cast of 'X-Men: First Class.' Hugh Jackman is still awesome as the Wolverine and really does manage to keep us entertain as the movie goes. James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Patrick Stewart, and Ian McKellen were also great in it; same goes to Jennifer Lawrence. I was like on the edge of my seat as I was watching the movie from beginning to end, when things go wrong and hopefully that our heroes will succeed. I really love this movie, and I am giving it a 10 out of 10. The X-Men series is back to its original roots, and I am more than happy that they are keeping this franchise alive.",10,1,2,26 May 2014
Die Hard 2," Great sequel, but can't beat the first
","'Die Hard 2' takes places after the first one as John McClane is now being moved from being a New York cop to a Los Angeles cop as he waits for his wife at an airport in Washington, D.C., but things don't go well as McClane has to deal with more bad guys as again like the first one to save the people and his wife on Christmas Eve. I thought 'Die Hard 2' is a very well done sequel, but it can't beat the first because it was a classic action movie while this one is not. Don't get me wrong, its a fun movie but I like the first one more. My problems with the movie is that the movie is very much like the first as it takes place at an airport instead of a tall building. Also, I don't think Colonel Stuart is that much of an interesting villain; I mean he's okay and the actor playing the villain name William Sadler does a fine job, but I really love the Gruber brothers more as they are both played by Alan Rickman and Jeremy Irons. So those were my only problems with this movie. Now, what do I like about this movie? Bruce Willis is still being awesome, and still kicking butt as John McClane; without him, this movie won't be worth watching. Bonnie Bedelia returns as McClane's wife from the first movie, but she doesn't have that much to do; nevertheless, she is really good in it. Reginald VelJohnson also returns from the first movie, which if I haven't mention him in my review of the first one then I apologize; I thought he was good in the first as well as this sequel. Although, he is not in the movie that often so he is just there to make a cameo. The movie is directed by Renny Harlin, who you may recognize him for directing 'Cliffhanger' and the fourth 'Nightmare on Elm Street' movie does a fine job with movie as well as handling the action scenes really well, and they are exciting to watch. Michael Kamen does again a fine job with the music as what he did in the first movie. The movie does go by at a really good pace, which if I had to admit, I originally thought the pacing was slow but now its better than I remember it to be. So that is what I thought of 'Die Hard 2' is a fun action movie, and it is worth watching. I give it a 9 out of 10.",9,2,3,22 December 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Mission Accomplished For Brad Bird's Live Action Film Debut
","After making three great animated feature films such as 'The Iron Giant,' The Incredibles,' and 'Ratatouille,' Brad Bird now makes his directorial debut on making a live action movie and what you know it he accomplished it. So the movie is about that the bomb when off by blowing up the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia as the IMF is shut down which now makes Ethan Hunt and his team to go after the bad guys that caused the Kremlin for being bombed. This was my first film to see a Brad Bird movie in theaters, because I never saw his other three movies as I mentioned them in the beginning of this review. I know Bird's first film 'The Iron Giant' is coming back this year on September 30th and October 4th, so that might be the perfect time to see one of his earlier films. With that said, I thought the premise of the movie is well told and I thought the movie does have a good mixture for balancing the action and spy genre aside what the other three movies did. Even though, I enjoyed them but this one balances both, and it succeeds it really well. The cinematography is wonderfully well shot, and really loved how it was filmed. The stunts in the movie are fantastic, especially where Tom Cruise is climbing onto a building. Again, the stunts are fantastic. The cast all did great, particularly for Cruise who is still giving a great performance, and doing most of his own stunts. Always being awesome. Jeremy Renner is in this movie, and I thought he was really good too. The rest all did well. The other actors from the first three movies are in this, but only there for a cameo. Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell from the first three movies only appears at the end, and so does Michelle Monaghan as Ethan's wife Julie. At first, I thought they either broke up or Julie dies, but Ethan tells Brandt that he had to fake his wife death in order to keep her safe and does not want to loose her like what happen in the third movie. Also, I was anxious if both Ethan and Julie would see each other, and they actually have until Ethan continues on with the next mission. Thank goodness that these two did not break up, because I actually love those two for being together and it never got me mad like what I had with the third 'Transformers' movie where they make both Shia Labeouf's and Megan Fox's character break up. Hated that! So I am glad that they did not break up in this movie. Michael Giacchino's music is also good too, and I may like his arrangement of the theme song more than I had with the third one. Now to the problems that I had with this movie. My only issues with the movie is that I did not see this movie in IMAX. Why is it a big deal? Well, seeing it in a regular theater is okay but I thought it would've been something to see in IMAX as the movie did feature some scenes that were filmed with IMAX cameras. Also, I was disappointed that the Blu Ray didn't have those scenes that were filmed in IMAX. I would have love to see to scenes in IMAX. Maybe this movie might be reissue in theaters or on Blu Ray so I can see the way how they were actually filmed. Heck, I would've love it to see the movie again on the big screen so that I can enjoy those scenes in IMAX. Same thing with Christopher Nolan's Interstellar. My other complaint is the villains. I don't think they were as interesting, nor as entertaining as I had with the other villains in the first three movies. Whether they're three dimensional or not, I still enjoy them. These villains don't have that much of a presence for the movie, nor they add anything new to the table; they're just there and you really don't care about them at all. So those are my only issues with the movie. Overall, I enjoy 'Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol' and I give kudos to Brad Bird on making his first live action movie. Mission accomplished on making a great 'Mission: Impossible' movie. I give this movie a 9 out of 10.",9,0,2,2 September 2015
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," It's not as good as the first, but it doesn't deserve the hate
","After the first one being a huge success, a sequel was made and everyone hates it. Does it deserve the hate? No. Here is why: the story is about Ian Malcolm one of the survivors of the first one goes out to find his girlfriend Sarah Harding on a different island that is filled with none other than dinosaurs. However, more expeditions come in as they are about to take dinosaurs off this island for another theme park attractions. Malcolm and the others need to stop them and each group of their own gets stuck on an island as they try to work together on how to get home. The main reason why no one likes this movie is because of two things: First, it doesn't have the same charm as the first which is true, and second they really hated on what the characters are doing like opening cages as dinosaurs destroy their camp or bringing in a baby T-Rex into an RV. I know everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I think everyone is misjudging it. I know its not as good as the first one, but I really enjoyed how it stands out on its own where it doesn't need to be like the first one. The characters to me are just like any other movie you see as once they are into risky situations, they just argue things over and are just having a hard time trusting each other and working together. I can defend their actions if I have to write this as a long review, but don't want to go too far on that. I thought Jeff Goldblum, in my opinion, plays a very good lead as in the first one he was once a funny side character, now he is more mature and he has once had his experience on Isla Nublar as he had to risks his life again on Isla Sorna to go out and find Sarah, and then come home. The other cast all did fine. Even though, there is not much to their character, but I would love if the movie has some more characterization. The story I thought was told fine as once again not being like the first one again. The special effects, well, at times there are parts that are slightly dated, but for the most part they looked really good. John Williams' music is just as good as he did with the music in the first one. I do love the final scene, where the T- Rex attacks San Diego which I thought was a well done action scene. Like the first one, the movie doesn't bored me as it still keeps my interest. 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' may not be a perfect movie, but I don't think its really Steven Spielberg's fault, I thought he did well enough on what he can bring to this movie that does give enough much excitements, and plenty of good dinosaur action. To me, I say give this movie another chance. If not, then no worries because everyone has an opinion and we respect it to each of our own. Again, it's not as good as the first, but it doesn't deserve the hate. I give this movie an 8 out of 10.",8,2,4,14 June 2015
A Quiet Place," A Film That Deals With Isolation, Survival and Redemption
","'A Quiet Place' is a film that deals with isolation, survival and redemption, as it tells the story of a family that are being hunted by creatures, whenever it reacts to sounds it kills by instinct. So the family must work together, as they will only have to communicate by sign language without making any sounds at all. First of all, I never got into the hype of the movie, as this movie was generating so much buzz after its debut at the South by Southwest Film Festival (same for 'Ready Player One'); moreover, I got curious about it, and see what the fuzz is all about. After seeing this in a movie theater, I was impressed how well executed the movie did. The movie really did told a good story, and this was all done in a visual way as it shows us, but never any need of telling us by just shoving it into our faces. The characters may not be three dimensional, but the movie does give us exactly what we need to know about, in order to care for them. The cast in this movie are outstanding. To start off, John Krasinski has done a fantastic job for portraying the husband and father of the movie, as his character is trying his best to keep his family safe and alive. Aside from his performance, he also knows how to make this movie to make it look like a film, and his direction is absolutely top notch. Kudos to Krasinski on making this a darn good movie. His wife, Emily Blunt, also does a terrific job in the movie as the wife and mother of the family. The child actors Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds have both done a great job, and for Simmonds, is really wonderful for her role, and Krasinski was smart enough to cast someone who is really deaf without having someone pretending to be deaf. The music by Marco Beltrami is really good, and very much one of his best scores as it is both terrifying and atmospheric. The cinematography itself is both gritty, and beautifully filmed at the same time. The movie does have a sense of fear and isolation as we hope the family in this movie remain alive, without being killed by a creature that hates sounds. There were moments that got me teared up, but have nothing else to complain about. The movie itself, which I can see as others compare to as this is a cross between 'Tremors' meets 'Signs;' it may not be original, but its about as original as it can get. If you haven't see 'A Quiet Place,' then feel free to check it out as this movie can definetly thrill you. As long as you are being quiet. I'm giving it a 10 out of 10.",10,2,5,6 October 2018
Ghostbusters," The Brave, The Best, The Only...Ghostbusters!
","'Ghostbusters,' is considered to be one of the greatest sci fi comedies of all time, and it has endured by many generations as they had grew up with this movie and still cherish it til this day. This movie was definetly a childhood of mine, as I watched this on an old VHS that was recorded on TV before having an actual copy of the movie; then it came to DVD, and now we have Blu Ray. Now I'm an adult, the question is: does it hold up? Well, here is my review. The movie is about these three scientist: Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz, and Egon Spengler as they all got fired from the university, so now all they have left is to start a business of their own by catching ghosts. Furthermore, we have Dana Barrett, who has a ghost problem as the building she lives in is being taken over by the evil Gozer as her minions known as the Terror Dogs to posses both Dana and her nerdy neighbor Louis Tully as they are about to bring the end of the world. Its up to our heroes to kick some ghost, and to save the world. Its as ridiculous as it may sound, but it works and definetly well executed. The movie's screenplay is written cleverly by both Dan Aykroyd and the late Harold Ramis, and they both have given great performances. Ernie Hudson, who plays Winston Zeddemore, doesn't show up into the second half of the movie but he does he give a good performance too. Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis are both excellent for the roles they were given to play. Annie Potts does fine for playing the secretary. William Atherton plays Walter Peck, as you really love to hate him. The villain Gozer is definetly a real threat, and really has a strong presence in this movie. As for Bill Murray, he is the man! He really steals the show, and his lines of dialogue are outstanding. Speaking of dialogue, the movie is definetly quotable for such great lines like 'Nice shootin' Tex,' 'Nobody steps on a church in my town,' 'He slimed me,' and of course 'Back off man, I'm a scientist.' The movie itself is really funny, and all thanks to its cast as they know how to make the comedy work. Even Ivan Reitman's direction is really well done as he balance it really well for mixing both the comedy and horror elements into the movie. The movie does go at a very good pacing as it feels tighter, and doesn't drag too long. The ghosts in this movie are memorable as you have Slimer, Gozer, Terror Dogs, Librarian Ghost, Stay Puft, as well as the Dream Ghost which I'll get to. The gadgets as everyone remembers the PKE Meter, Ghost Trap, Ecto Goggles, and the Proton Packs. Cannot forget the Ectomobile! Elmer Bernstein's music is definetly one of his greatest scores, and does have a great soundtrack such as the theme song by Ray Parker Jr., 'Cleanin' Up The Town,' 'Magic,' and 'Savin' the Day.' The special effects may have some bad ones that don't age well, but for the most part, they are really good as this was all done practically without any use of CG at all. That is minor issue, but the major issue, which I am not a fan of is that dream scene where Ray has sex with a female ghost. I thought it was totally out of place, and should've been left on the cutting room floor. That is just my personal opinion. Nevertheless, 'Ghostbusters,' is still a classic as it is funny, exciting, suspenseful, creative, and has a good heart. I am giving this movie a 9 out of 10!",9,4,4,2 June 2018
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Decent movie, but it seems to be kind of a mess
","This review may contain spoilers because I think I should give my reasons about the movie on whats right and wrong. I don't review movies that contain spoilers because I rather much prefer not to give away things that were in the movie; however, if I do give away I would say it only if the movie is already shown in theaters. This may or may not be the only review that I give out spoilers, but its not a big deal. Enjoy my review. I did go see 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' in theaters, and I thought it left me with a split reaction. Here are the good stuff: First, I said in my review of 'The Amazing Spider-Man' that James Horner's score was okay, but not as amazing as Danny Elfman's score. Although I did say that Horner's score may grew on me if I did say it or not. With that said, with James Horner out of the picture Hans Zimmer comes in to do score after scoring 'Man of Steel' and The Dark Knight Trilogy.' How was it? It was pretty darn good. This may be better than Horner's, and may be the best one. Second, I thought the chemistry between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacey are very good. The acting in this movie is well done, but I give most props to Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. The action is great along with its wonderful special effects, and third, the Spider-Man costume look awesome. I do enjoy the last costume he wore in the last movie, but I enjoy this one the best. Not only is it faithful to the comics, but I really love the the textures and the details. It pretty much reminds me of the original Spider-Man suit in the Sam Raimi movies. So what's wrong with this movie? The villains in this movie are not interesting. It has nothing to do with the acting, and I don't think anyone did terrible. I just didn't buy anyone that I'm suppose to get invest with. Electro is our main villain in this movie, and I thought the filmmakers handle his character wrong. The design of him looks fine, but the way he portrays in this movie is like watching a clone version of Edward Nygma from 'Batman Forever.' He first starts off as fan of the city's savior, and then turns against him. Jamie Foxx is a fine actor, but he seems to be badly directed and not portraying him right as he was in the comics. Paul Giamatti plays Rhino in this movie, but he is only there for short time and has nothing much to do. Like Foxx, a fine actor. Now before I talk about Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn/Green Goblin, I like to point out on Chris Cooper as Norman Osborn. He is only there for a cameo, and just dies already. We don't see him become the Green Goblin, but we see Harry instead. Looks like Cooper is only here for a check. Now DeHaan, he may be a fine actor as I seen him in 'Chronicle' but he seems to be too much to play both Harry and his alter ego. While the design of the original Green Goblin was alright in the original first movie, but this design is way overdone. They probably may him too menacing for the actor, and wish if they tone him down a bit. He does become the Green Goblin at the end, but it seems to be rushed. I know the Green Goblin is suppose to be menacing, but not that menacing. Willem Dafoe, in my opinion, did better because not only he was serious, but he was also having a fun time as well. He is like Spider Man's own Joker because he laughs, and kills people. So that is my own thoughts on the Green Goblin. The story itself is not balance well enough because at times it can be serious like Christopher Nolan or Tim Burton, while at other times it can be like Joel Schumacher. Also, I thought the marketing isn't really that good because they gave away in the trailers and other stuff that I know maybe others do know that Gwen Stacey is suppose to die in this movie. That just ruins the suspense, and should have not been giving away to those who may have not read the comic books. This movie is on par with 'Spider-Man 3' because they both have flaws, but they are enjoyable. Overall, 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' is decent movie, but it seems to be kind of a mess. I give this movie a 7 out of 10.",7,0,2,1 June 2014
Back to the Future Part III," A great conclusion for this trilogy
","Picking up where the second one left off, lighting struck the time machine as it sends Doc back to the old west in 1885 as Marty goes back to find him, and try to bring him back home to 1985. Meanwhile, Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen is having a showdown with Marty besides killing Doc, and Doc has fallen in love with the woman of his life Claire Clayton. Everyone has their own views on which 'Back to the Future' sequel is the best, but to me personally, I think they're both good and I do say that I like three slightly more than two. However, they're both not as good as the first. In my opinion, I think the humor is just as funny as the first two, and I still think that taking place in the old west isn't that bad of an idea. I do like how the west looks, and really doesn't come off from a set of a television movie or show if you may ask. I thought the drama for the characters are really well handled, and I thought Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd both continue to be great together. Lea Thompson and Thomas F. Wilson are great too, while Mary Steenburgen does a fine job and I don't find her character annoying. The special effects are good, while some are dated like having two characters in the same scene just like what the second one did as I need to mention that. The pacing is well done, and the story really did kept me involved with it. Robert Zemeckis' direction is very well directed, and I love Alan Silvestri's music. The song 'Doubleback' by ZZ Top is my favorite song of the trilogy, and I really do listen quite often. As for the ending, I thought it ended exactly how it should end as the movie does have a great message as what Doc says in the movie 'Your future is whatever you make it, so make it a good one.' I sure hope that everyone can relate to that line, and we can make the future whatever we want to make. I really have a lot of fun with this movie, and I don't think it deserves the hate it gets. 'Back to the Future Part III' is a great conclusion for this trilogy, and I am giving this movie a 9 out of 10.",9,3,3,21 November 2015
The Nightmare Before Christmas," One of the Greatest Stop-Motion Animated Movies Ever Made!
","'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is one of those movies that is part of my childhood, and never I find this movie boring or get sick and tired of it. The movie is about a talking skeleton name Jack Skellington who is getting tired of Halloween, and is wanting to do something totally different. So, he discovers about Christmas and decides to try it out. Jack gets the people of Halloween Town to make Christmas, and does for what he has to do on his own. I really love this movie, and it is a heck a lot of fun to watch. I always remember this movie from beginning to end. Tim Burton has created these extraordinary characters that are fun and interesting to look at; so, here he really achieves it. I know he didn't direct this movie, which, of course, the movie is directed by Henry Selick who would go on directing 'Coraline' and 'James and the Giant Peach.' He does a fine job directing this movie as well as keeping faithful to what Burton envision it. However, when you watch this movie, it really feels like a Tim Burton movie if Burton may have ghostly directed it or something like that. Chris Sarandon does a great job for voicing Jack Skellington as well as Catherine O'Hara for voicing Sally. Everyone in this movie for voicing these characters all did great on their own. The designs of the sets and characters are so darn remarkable, and the the stop-motion animation is incredibly well done. The songs and music by Danny Elfman are really far beyond from being good; they are so memorable like 'This is Halloween;' 'Making Christmas;' 'What's this?;' etc. Many of you would like to know if this movie is either a Halloween movie or a Christmas movie; it just depends on what you make of. To me, personally, I think its both and I always get in the mood when it comes to both Halloween and Christmas at the same time. If you haven't seen this movie, check it out! 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is one of the greatest stop-motion animated movies ever made, and it is one of Burton's greatest achievements! I give it a perfect 10 out of 10.",10,1,1,24 December 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," Fun comic book movie
","'Guardians of the Galaxy' was never on my list of movies that I want to see in 2014 because I wasn't too crazy on the marketing that they putted for the movie, but I did give it a fair shake by going into low expectations like the 'TMNT' reboot that I have just reviewed today (check it out), and was actually really enjoying it. The 'TMNT' reboot was okay and it did entertained me, but I was really entertained by this one more than the 'TMNT' reboot. As you read you this review there could be some little spoilers. So here it is: I actually did had a fun time seeing this movie in theaters, and I did thought it was funny. The cast in this movie like Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, and such were all pretty good in their own roles. The action in this movie are very well done, but I don't think they are the greatest or shall I say epic. I thought it did a pretty good by telling story along with the characters that I need to know about. James Gunn has done a fine job on directing movie, and did told a very good story. The special effects in the movie are actually very fascinating to look at. The music by Tyler Bates was fine, but I don't think it is really that memorable or one of those movies scores that I would listen to; the used of 1970's soundtrack really does work for the movie, and there could be some that many other people that love 70's music would pretty much like this movie. Although, I don't think its Marvel's best comic book movie because I am still sticking up with 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' as not only Marvel's best, but the best comic book movie of 2014. The humor in this movie is really funny, but it's not really laugh out loud hilarious. Also, the villain in this movie was weak, and not really the best villain that I have seen in a Marvel movie because I have seen better villains in other Marvel movies. Also, during the post credit scene, I was actually surprised to see a Howard the Duck cameo which I think that Marvel might make a legitimate reboot of the character, and do things right than the original 1986 movie which I am going to review that after doing a review of 'Guardians of the Galaxy.' Overall, it is a fun comic book movie and I think you would enjoy it too. I give this movie a 9 out of 10.",9,0,3,14 August 2014
Jurassic World," A Must See!
","After 'Jurassic Park III' which it did leave me a bitter taste, there was a bunch of talks of making a fourth one. I just thought it needed to stop, but I as read more information about it and the more I began to show some interest. I've read that the filmmakers wanted this film to honor on what made the first one really good, and it just felt like a good sign there. So I stay away as much of any new footage being shown on the internet like trailers; TV spots; etc. I just want to be as surprise as I can be. Was I surprise? Heck yeah! I really love this movie. Before I can go any further, this review will not contain spoilers because you have to see it for yourself. I thought 'Jurassic World' really did capture the spirit as what the first one did. Is it better than the sequels? Well, as much as I like the second one, I do say that yes it is better than the sequels and it is the second best film of the series. Yes, second best because I don't think its quite as good as the first one, but it is as close as you are going to get. I thought Colin Trevorrow has done a fantastic job on making this movie, and making us feel like kids again. The story is very well told, and I do love the look of the theme park as it makes you want to go there and have lots of fun. As long as you don't get eaten by dinosaurs. The cast all did great. Chris Pratt does an awesome job for playing such likable lead, and I thought Bryce Dallas Howard did good as well. The movie is, thankfully, a two hour ride as what the first two movies were because I wasn't a fan of the run time on the third one. The movie does have its wondrous moments and it has a lot more excitements, and really filled with dinosaur action. The music by Michael Giacchino is pretty darn good, and he was the right choice to do score for reminded us of John Williams' music like what he did with his other film 'Super 8.' The design of the new dinosaur looks really good, but nothing more I can say about it. I do find it interesting where the Raptors are working with Pratt's character. The ending I won't give away is beautiful, because I was laughing happily and tears were pouring down from my eyes as I was now crying that it just shows how much I love the first 'Jurassic Park' movie. So what is wrong with the movie? While I do say the special effects are really good, and I am glad that they are sticking with the tradition for using practical and CGI effects. However, I do wish if the filmmakers can use a bit more on practical effects. Also, there are some characters that I like while they are others that kind of annoyed me. Vincent D'Onofrio may have done a fine job, but he is just there to play a bad guy. That is about it. So, yeah the movie does have its flaws, but it doesn't take away the experience that I had with this movie. I am glad Steven Spielberg gave it a stamp approval because he thought it felt like seeing 'Jurassic Park' again. I pretty much cannot denied it. 'Jurassic World' is a must see, and I am giving it a 9 out of 10.",9,16,43,14 June 2015
Mission: Impossible II," Fun action movie, but not a good Mission: Impossible movie
","Now after reviewing the first movie, this time, we accelerate to a sequel that many critics and fans considered this to be the weakest film of the series. However, is it the worst? Here it goes: Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt goes on a mission to Sydney, Australia alongside with his IMF team as they go after a deadly virus to be destroy. Also, keeping a lookout on a thief, who happens to be in a relationship with our main villain Sean Ambrose. That doesn't sound much like a plot, don't you think? I guess that's all up to you. The plot I will admit isn't as interesting as the plot from the first one as that one was trying to be more of a mystery movie. This one, however, its just pretty much a simplistic plot with plenty of action. I don't mind plots being simple, but it would've been something if it has a plot that is actually more interesting. Aside the plot for being weak, the plane from the opening scene of the movie is purely CG, and it really doesn't look good at all; at least the bird went through a fire (also CG that appears toward the end) doesn't look as bad as the plane. Thandie Newton does an OK job for her performance, but her character isn't as compelling as any other female leads that I've seen in movies. So those were the issues, but is there anything good? Yes, there is. I thought Tom Cruise does a great job for reprising his role, and really is good for doing his own stunts. I love how he was introduce, during the opening scene where he is rock climbing. Also, him rock climbing is all done for real. Kudos to Cruise and the filmmakers for filming that scene for real instead of filming it on a set. Dougray Scott does a fine job for playing a villain, but don't find him to be complex enough. Nevertheless, I have fun watching him. The rest all did fine. John Woo's direction is actually not that bad at all. He does a fantastic job on the action scenes, and also knowing where to point the camera at. Moreover, on the action scenes, they're exciting to watch and really love the final confrontation between Ethan Hunt and Sean Ambrose. Hans Zimmer's music is very different than Danny Elfman's, but I love his arrangement on the theme song and how he provides his own take of the music for the movie. When I hear the guitar riffs, I just go flat out crazy because it makes you want to rock out. I love the look of Australia as it was being filmed. Also, never I find this to be boring. Sure the plot is weak, but I can just put this movie in and enjoy it for its mindless entertainment. All in all, its a John Woo movie and he has own unique style on making this movie. It may be the weakest film of the series, but I don't think its actually the worst that I've ever seen. Overall, 'Mission: Impossible II' is a fun action movie, but not a good 'Mission: Impossible' movie. I give it a 7 out of 10.",7,1,1,30 August 2015
Mission: Impossible," A suspenseful film with a premise that keeps you interest
","I have watched this movie for the first time on DVD back in 2006 and really enjoy it. As time goes by, I wasn't sure if this movie would still hold up after looking up everyone's thoughts on the movie, especially the Jim Phelps twist that everyone hates. So I watched it, and I really don't think it was that bad. So the premise of the film is about Ethan Hunt, our main hero, who goes undercover to find out who has framed not only himself, but his team that were killed during their mission. While figuring it out, he also recruits some new team members while teaming up with Jim Phelps' wife Claire as they try to retrieve the IMF NOC list. So, basically, it plays out like a mystery movie as Ethan Hunt has to figure on who did this and why; its not really much of an action movie but I think the movie works on its own level as it plays very low key or a bit in your own opinion of the movie. Also, I have read that some of the original cast members of the original show and die hard fans were very upset that they made Jim Phelps the bad guy. I don't know if its actually a big deal, or what were they expecting for the movie as it first came out but I do know is that I have never watched the show nor have any knowledge to it whatsoever. Furthermore, I wasn't as upset as what the live action 'Scooby Doo' movie did when they made Scrappy Doo the bad guy. So I guess you can say that I'm okay with Jim Phelps for being the bad guy, and I thought Jon Voight's performance was really good. The rest of the cast all did fine on their own, and I do say that Tom Cruise who is really good and also being awesome at the same time. I thought the direction that Brian De Palma did was incredibly well done. I really do admire the premise of the movie, and I do find it very Hitchcockian as it keeps you interest to know what is going on. The movie does have some very good suspenseful parts like the scene where Ethan Hunt is being hung on cables as they try to retrieve the list. I love Danny Elfman's music of the movie, and his arrangements of the 'Mission: Impossible' theme. The final scene of the movie was alright because I kind of which if the helicopter wasn't CG so that it wouldn't had to be in a tunnel. There were parts that are real, while other parts were not. I guess they were trying to be safe, because it is understandable that using helicopters in movies can be dangerous but it is for what it is. The movie does have some good stunt work, but its Tom Cruise who is actually doing it all by himself. Some of the actors, were just replace with doubles as like what I just said about the final scene is just playing safe. When I look back at the sequels, I'm sure they do better than what this movie as when they are parts that took risks, while others not. I still respect this movie for being low key, but that is just my opinion. So, yeah, I actually still love 'Mission: Impossible' and I don't think it was as bad as some of the negativity that I've read. It is a suspenseful film with a premise that keeps you interest. I give it an 8 out of 10.",8,1,1,30 August 2015
The Last Samurai," A Very Satisfying Movie
","'The Last Samurai' is a very satisfying movie and it is definitely worth checking out. This a beautiful looking movie, and I do think everyone should give this movie a shot. I thought Tom Cruise has done an amazing job for his role as Captain Nathan Algren. This is one of his greatest achievements for his career as an actor. Ken Watanabe was absolutely fascinating as Katsumoto, and he really deserves plenty of recognition, and deserving an Oscar nomination. The chemistry between Cruise and Watanabe is quite enjoyable, and really does work as they try to get know each other. Also, I thought Koyuki the actress that play the Samurai's wife that was killed by Cruise's character is actually very good. While I do give praises to the chemistry between Cruise and Watanabe, I also do enjoy the chemistry between Cruise and Koyuki; they both played each other really well. The romance between the two really works, especially during some of the quite moments in the movie are actually very well effective. I thought the cinematography is beautifully shot, and really does capture that particular time era as it is set in Japan. Edward Zwick's direction is actually very good, and he does tell a great story. The music by Hans Zimmer is powerful, energetic, and it is beautiful. The battle scene at the end is well done, but I do think that it is a little bit too long and wish if they trim some parts out so it wouldn't be too long. I really do enjoy watching 'The Last Samurai' and I am giving it a 10 out of 10.",10,1,2,26 May 2014
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Fun movie, but its not that bad
","'Home Alone 2: Lost in New York' takes place after the events of the first one as Kevin is finally going on a Christmas vacation with his family, but gets left behind again as he ends up in New York instead of going to Florida as where his family is going. Now Harry and Marv are back as they went from being the Wet Bandits to the Sticky Bandits, try to get revenge on Kevin as Kevin deals with them again as he saves Christmas and stopping them from stealing the money's charity that were suppose to be donated to the children's hospital by Ducan's Toy Chest. Okay, I'll admit that this movie is not as good as the first one but I don't think it deserves the hate it gets. I've seen sequels that are worse than 'Home Alone 2.' Heck, I think the third and fourth are worse than the second; the fifth I did not seen and would not have any desire to give it a watch. I think, in my humble opinion, 'Home Alone 2' is a fun sequel than any of the 'Home Alone' sequels that got made. I thought John Hughes did a fine job with the script as well as what Chris Columbus had to do for directing it. John Williams' music is just as good as the first one, and the cast did great. Macaulay Culkin really does well as he did in the first. Even Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern both still made a great chemistry together. Of course, you got to have Tim Curry who is indeed a lot of fun. Brenda Fricker was good too, but she is just another version of Roberts Blossom from the first movie (forgot to mention that Roberts Blossom is also really good in the first one). I thought some of the slapstick in the movie were really good, but some were flat; the movie does have some fine humor, but weren't as good as the first. I really do love some of the shots in New York along with some of the Christmas scenery that are in this movie. I understand some of the similarities that were done in the first one, but it wasn't 100 percent carbon copy. You still get some things that are different. I would have mind if they have tried something new, but I do give it a pass because I was already entertained enough with this movie. I do wonder why Kevin's family is watching 'It's a Wonderful Life' in Spanish when they are in Florida as the movie they are watching should have been in English. In the first one, the same movie they are watching is in French which makes sense because they are in Paris. However, you can make an argument if the reason they are watching 'It's a Wonderful Life' in Spanish is that there weren't any Christmas movies to watch so they ended watching this movie in Spanish because its a Christmas movie. If its true, then I get it but that is just me. Also, not sure if I'm wrong or not that Kevin's father should have just checked on Kevin on how is he doing as they are running to catch their flight to Florida. It's your call on that. Lastly, I wish if the family would stop treating Kevin like garbage as for what they did in the first one. Should have learn their lessons. With that said, I don't think the movie deserves to be ignore because I think it deserves the attention as what the first one did; the third; fourth and fifth movies are the ones that need to be ignore. That's just my opinion on that. 'Home Alone 2: Lost in New York' is a fun movie, but its not that bad; I still think its fun, entertaining, and still has that Christmas feeling as what made the first one so good about it. Not sure if I put this in the underrated category, but I know its not as bad as what everyone makes it out to be. I say give it a chance! I give this movie an 8 out of 10.",8,1,1,17 December 2014
The Disaster Artist," The Ed Wood of 2017
","'The Disaster Artist' tells the true story of Greg Sestero (actor who played Mark in 'The Room,' and co-wrote the book with Tom Bissell) as he is desperately wanting to be an actor, while he comes across a man who came from another world name Tommy Wiseau as they both became friends, and would go on to make the greatest bad movie of all time known as 'The Room.' I have seen 'The Room,' which I thought was mind-blowing, and never thought anyone would make this bad, aside from Ed Wood who has been making bad movies. Even Uwe Boll, himself, makes bad movies based on video games. 'The Disaster Artist,' has been receiving a lot of buzz, and I believe that James Franco, who not only deserves to be nominated, but deserves to win the Oscar for either Best Actor or Supporting Actor. Either way, he deserves to win one. He really capture did capture the spirit of Tommy Wiseau, who at times is crazy, but shows that he really is human. We really do feel for him, and we follow him along as he trying to make this movie. Dave Franco plays Greg Sestero, and seeing him alongside with James really do feel like that they are best friends, and not make things distracting that in real life they're brothers. Seth Rogen play Sandy Schklair, the script supervisor who claims himself that he was the director of 'The Room,' and not Tommy Wiseau. He really is just like what audiences would pretty much point out of the flaws that Tommy is making, and he plays it really well too. The rest of the cast all did great. Franco's direction is really well done, and does know how to tell a good story, while getting invested with the characters. The cinematography is shot handheld, but it does give a sense of realism that it feels like real life, and while watching the movie, you feel like that were part of the behind the scenes of 'The Room.' The movie itself is not only funny, but definetly has a really good message when it comes to film making. I believe does go up there with 'Ed Wood,' and both of those movies do share similar themes and messages. They both deal with friendship, and have a great message about making movies. Like 'Ed Wood,' this movie should be shown to the scholars, and to those that are interest in the film making business. I won't spoil the movie for you, because I want you to see this movie and judge it on your own. If any of you are fans of 'The Room,' then you are going to love this movie. I had a fun time watching 'The Disaster Artist,' and I am giving this movie a 10 out of 10.",10,1,2,15 December 2017
Die Hard," Yippee Ki Yay to One of the Greatest Action Films Ever Made!
","'Die Hard' is about a New York cop, John McClane who has come to Los Angeles, California to celebrate Christmas with his family on Christmas Eve. His wife Holly McClane, who formally is now Holly Gennaro is now working at the Nakatomi Plaza building as everyone is enjoying the Christmas party when a group of terrorist led by Hans Gruber is taking over the building as the people are being hostage, and as Gruber is trying to robbed the building's money. So, it us up to McClane to kick some major butt at Gruber and his men to save his wife, and the rest of the hostages. 'Die Hard' is without a doubt one of the greatest action films ever made as well as being a Christmas classic; it really does kick a whole lot of butt as I am watching it. Bruce Willis is and shall always be remembered as John McClane; he gave such an awesome performance and there is no one to play the role because Willis is so darn perfect. Of course, he did deliver the famous 'Yippee Ki Yay' line and it is indeed memorable because everyone always remember that line. Alan Rickman plays such a memorable villain, and he is a whole lot of fun to watch. The rest of the cast are great in their own roles. Michael Kamen does a fantastic job with the music, and it does give so much excitement as there is action going on; also, I thought the action is really darn good and it really is exciting. The movie does go by at a very good pace, and it never tries to slow things down. John McTiernan, who just got off from directing another great movie by Twentieth Century Fox 'Predator' does deliver a great movie, and does handle it well when it all comes to action movies. There have been many movies that tried to ripoff the same formula as what this movie did will never be as good, or the same as what made 'Die Hard' so awesome. I love this movie so much, and I give it a 10 out of 10.",10,1,2,20 December 2014
Stranger Than Fiction," A Wonderfully and Visually Experience
","Will Ferrell can always make audiences laugh, but can he make audiences feel sad and be more sympathetic for whatever role he takes? The answer is without a doubt: Yes. Will Ferrell is absolutely fantastic in his role as IRS Agent Harold Crick; he can not only be funny, but also can be serious. This is in my opinion my absolute favorite Will Ferrell movie. If you like him doing comedies, then you'll love him doing drama. He really does steal the show. The idea of a man whose life is always distracted by a narrator is actually a pretty clever concept, and I thought it was well executed. I do get the sense of the movie as it was taken place in Chicago because the city itself does play a character, you usually do get a sense of the environment and see how these people do with their lives (EX: kid riding on a bike, an African-American woman doing her job, etc.). The direction by Marc Forster is outstanding, and he really does tell a good story and knows where to point the camera at. The rest of the cast Emma Thompson, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Dustin Hoffman, and Queen Latifah all do their jobs well. The story; the pacing; the cinematography; the editing; the direction; and the music all come together pretty well. This is also one of my favorite movies, and my favorite Marc Forster movie. I do enjoy his direction alright in a James Bond movie 'Quantum of Solace,' but I love his work on this one the best. The movie does add into a lot of context, which it is hard to explain but I can't help it on how much I really love this movie. 'Stranger Than Fiction' is both a wonderfully and visually experience. I give this movie a 10 out of 10.",10,1,2,31 July 2014
Jaws," The Definitive Shark Movie
","After Steven Spielberg directing his TV movie 'Duel,' and his first theatrical movie 'The Sugarland Express' he would go on to direct a movie about a man-eating shark that attacks people. The movie is about a great white shark, that has been causing all the issue for attacking innocent people on Amity Island as our three main characters set out by sea to go find the shark, and kill it so no one would have anymore shark problems whatsoever. 'Jaws' is a cinematic masterpiece of filmmaking, and I thought Spielberg is able to bring such tension of suspense and excitement as you are going along with the ride. The production of this movie had numerous problems to get the shark to work, but Spielberg made such a wise choice to not show the shark as learned from one his idols Alfred Hitchcock as he makes this movie very suspenseful as he did with 'Duel' for not showing the truck driver. He only shows the shark toward the end of the movie, which it makes a very good build up to show the shark. Also, the movie works well with the human characters as they don't come out as cardboard cutouts, but make them as they act like real people. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss are excellent together in this movie, and they make a great chemistry. I have never read the book, but I'm sure that movie is different than what the book represents. Peter Benchley wrote the book, as well as co-writing the screenplay with Carl Gottlieb and the movie does have a very well written script. The shark itself is very well done for its mixture for using practical effects, and real-life shark footage by Ron and Valerie Taylor; this is before CG as they had to film a real shark so the filmmakers won't have to keep going practical with the shark. As for John Williams, his music is completely unforgettable and really loved the theme that he created for this movie; its a good thing that he won an Oscar for his music of the movie, and he really deserves that kind of recognition. The movie does go at a very good pace, and I thought the climax at the end between Brody and the shark is very well done. The opening scene, in my opinion, is really Spielberg's own shower scene from 'Psycho' as it is shocking to see this poor woman get killed by our main antagonist. I'm not going into much detail about this movie because everyone has seen 'Jaws,' and it will always continue to be a classic movie as well as one of Spielberg's best films. 'Jaws' will always be the definitive shark movie, and nothing can compare to this masterpiece. I give it a 10 out of 10.",10,2,4,15 September 2015
Inception," For five years, this is still a wonderful movie!
","Its been five years, since this movie came out during the summer of 2010. So does this movie still hold up? Well, here is my review. 'Inception' is about a thief name Cobb, who steals corporate secrets through the use of dream sharing technology is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a CEO. So as things go haywire, Cobb and the rest of his team have to go a dream within a dream in order to get the idea that is in the CEO's dream space. When I first saw this movie, I felt like that I was watching a realistic version of 'The Matrix.' Of course, Christopher Nolan used 'The Matrix' as one of his inspirations. No I will not make a comparison between this movie and 'The Matrix;' but I will say that both films have the same thing as they talk about dreams and reality. So enough babbling, do I love this movie? Yes I love this movie since it first came out, and for five years, it still is a wonderful movie. I thought Nolan does a capable job on a telling a story, which I thought it was very innovating and I thought he does an incredible job on directing the movie. The action in this movie is pretty darn good. The cinematography by Wally Pfister is so beautifully well shot on film, while the design of the movie's production is very well crafted. The special effects in this movie are visually stunning to look, and the people that worked on the effects really do handle it well for mixing it up for both using CGI and practical. The cast in this movie all did great, but I give most props to Leonardo DiCaprio as Cobb. For his character, you do feel sorry for him as he doesn't want to do the assignment because he wants to go home. However, he is afraid to go home because his children think he killed their mother, and the mother is actually played by Marion Cotillard. The movie is very well edit, and it does go by at a very good pace and really does kept me very interest as I am watching the movie. Of course, many people have always view about the ending but in my view, I say that he got out of the dream and he is living very happily reuniting with his children. So for five years, 'Inception' is still a wonderful movie and I am more than glad that this movie holds up quite well. I still love 'Inception,' and I give this movie a 10 out of 10! Oh, and one more thing, the movie is also very smart.",10,1,3,12 January 2015
Halloween," A Classic 70s Slasher Flick
","Before there was Jason Voorhees, Freddy Krueger, Ghostface, and among others; there was Michael Myers, an unstoppable evil, who stalks and lurks its victims. And wears a William Shatner. LOL! In all seriousness, 'Halloween,' tells the story about Michael Myers on what happened 15 years earlier into the movie. He kills his own sister, and gets himself to be in hospital. Flash forward to 1978, Michael Myers escapes and goes into Haddonfield, Illinois by killing some victims around Halloween night. I first saw this movie on AMC, which is probably during its Fear Fest (if I remember correctly), and thought it was pretty darn good. I was so drawn in of the psychological aspects of Michael Myers as what Dr. Sam Loomis describes him, where there was a scene that Loomis explains the Sheriff about Michael Myers, when he first met him as a six years old with a blank, cold emotionless face, and the blackest eyes, the devil's eyes. That is all you need to know. His character perfectly sums up how evil Michael Myers is, and definetly what makes him into an icon. Donald Pleasence does an amazing job for the role that he was born to play, and he is Sam Loomis. Its funny to know that Carpenter uses that name from a classic Hitchcock movie 'Psycho,' and the character of Sam Loomis was played by John Gavin. Jamie Lee Curtis, the daughter of Janet Leigh, makes her debut as an actress, and really does a real good job as Laurie Strode, the girl next door. We start off from her not being strong into a strong character. The rest of the cast like P.J. Soles, Nancy Kyes, and others all did well for what they were given. John Carpenter is a gifted filmmaker, and was more than good as he is terrific for writing the script alongside with Debra Hill; then he was terrific for directing and creating an iconic musical score. The cinematography by Dean Cundey is marvelous, and really do love the looks of the film's visual. The atmosphere itself is very moody, and does give you the feel of Halloween. The premise is superb, and never I find it boring. The movie doesn't have that much gore like what you see in other horror movies, but it works well without it. I don't know what is left to say about 'Halloween,' except that its a classic 70s slasher flick, and it could be my favorite Carpenter movie. I believe it is. I love 'Halloween,' and I give it a 10 out of 10. Be careful or the boogeyman is going to get you.",10,1,1,14 October 2018
Back to the Future Part II," Its finally 2015, and we have a fun sequel!
","Picking up where the first one left off, Doc takes Marty for an adventure as they travel to the future 2015 as they take care some business; while that is going on, Marty's nemesis Biff steals the time machine by giving the sports almanac that Marty bought to his younger self as he creates an alternate dimension. So its up to Doc and Marty to stop Biff for letting this all happening as they try to fix time. The year is finally 2015, and the 2015 we have today is nothing like what the movie looked. Of course, I have look up many news and videos as they try to create shoes that laces themselves, and creating hover-boards that float. No the Cubs did not win the World Series, but we came so close to make that predictability a reality. So anyway, 'Back to the Future Part II' is a fun sequel to watch, but not as good as the first. I thought Michael J. Fox, and Christopher Lloyd are still great together, while Lea Thompson and the rest of the cast all did great. Of course, I have to mention Thomas F. Wilson who is really good for playing a bad guy like the character he played in all three movies. The look of 2015 is really well done, which it doesn't go into the same style like what 'Blade Runner' looked. The movie does have its exciting moments, and you are always rooting for Marty and Doc as they try to save time. The special effects by ILM are really good, while some seem slightly dated. The movie is also funny too, so nothing much that I can say about. Alan Silvestri's music is also really good too along side with the story. I do wish if the opening scene wasn't re-shot, but Claudia Wells was unable to due to what is happening with her family; its understandable but can't complain about that. However, I do wish if Crispin Glover was in this movie but he ends up not to due to what his reasons were as he needed more money, and not appreciating how the first one ended. I do disagree with his thoughts on the ending, and I still wish if he was in this movie. So with that said, I enjoy 'Back to Future Part II,' and I am sure that you will have a fun time with this one. I give this movie a 9 out of 10.",9,11,13,21 November 2015
The Iron Giant," Brad Bird's Greatest Achievement
","I have seen many promos with this movie on television, and was curious to see it. Sadly, I didn't, so I guess you can say that I was lazy for not seeing it. No matter, I did see this on HBO and watch this many times as it aired as a 24 hour marathon on Cartoon Network when Warner Bros and Cartoon Network were promoting 'The Powerpuff Girls Movie' with a music video during the end credits of 'The Iron Giant.' The movie itself feels timeless, and I know this movie will continue to find an audience despite of its failure at the box office when it first came out in theaters. I am more than happy that this movie has a cult following, and there many fans that are embracing it. With that said, 'The Iron Giant' its about a boy named Hogarth Hughes who lives with his mother Annie a waitress has discovered a giant metallic robot, who fell from space and befriends him. A beatnik artist Dean McCoppin looks out for the Giant at a junkyard, but federal agent Kent Mansley wants to find the Giant and destroy it. The movie is itself is like Steven Spielberg's 'E.T. the Extra Terrestrial,' but it acts very much its own movie. I continue to love this movie as I watch it, and I see nothing wrong about it. The movie does look gorgeous in widescreen as it gives it a much epic feel to it in a CinemaScope format. As much as we love animated movies in CGI like Pixar or DreamWorks, but I do think its beautiful to see an animated movie to be all done traditionally by hand instead of having it all done by a computer. The animation is again beautiful with all the rich colors, and details that were all put into this movie. I do love how the movie looks as the movie takes place in 1957. The movie does have some funny moments, and I guess a bit edgy for an animated movie that features some curse words. The movie is made for kids, but its something that adults would enjoy. Hey, when I first saw this movie, I didn't expect to hear any curse words in an animated movie which I thought it was going to be a clean animated movie like what Disney did with their animated movies. I guess both Bird and Warner Bros. want it to take it up a notch. The movie is rated PG, and nothing to be worrying about. Or shocking for that matter. I do love the characters, and really love the way they're designed. Also, I thought it had great voice acting. Jennifer Aniston; Harry Connick, Jr.; Eli Marienthal and Christopher McDonald were all really good for their own roles. Vin Diesel, I thought, was perfectly cast for voicing the Iron Giant, and can't imagine any one voicing it aside from Diesel. Michael Kamen's score to the movie is very good, and nothing more that I can say about. I love its story and the direction that the filmmakers went, and I think its perfectly executed. This is Brad Bird's greatest achievement, and should be given a lot of credit for making this wonderful movie. I have heard that Bird and Warner Bros. are both working on bringing this movie for a limited release this year on September the 30th, and October the 4th for remastering it and presenting two new scenes for the movie. This new cut will be called 'The Iron Giant: Signature Edition.' I am very excited about it, and would love to see this on the big screen like I never had before. I love 'The Iron Giant,' and I am giving this movie a 10 out of 10.",10,5,6,24 August 2015
The Wolverine," 'The Wolverine' is a big improvement over the last Wolverine movie
","After 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' came out five years ago, which it receive many mixed or negative reviews by critics and fans alike were not satisfied with the final results on how the movie did. I used to love it, but not anymore because 'The Wolverine' is a big improvement over the last Wolverine movie. James Mangold is a much capable director to make the Wolverine movie as it should be. The last Wolverine movie tried to be a character study, but it was poorly executed; this movie did better. The story is well told and it does manage to be more faithful to the Wolverine comics because our main character does go to Japan, and fall in love with Mariko. Hugh Jackman gives an amazing performance, and should be more proud for this movie. Jackman admitted it that the last Wolverine movie didn't do well as he thought it would. The rest of the Japanese cast all did well for there parts. Famke Janssen returning as Jean Grey did fine, but nothing special I can say. I can say that for Wolverine's character does work for his downer side because he kill Jean on the third X-Men, and we do actually feel bad for him. The music by Marco Beltrami is actually really good, which it does differ from Harry Gregson- Williams's score. The special effects are much better than the last one, and thankfully, the claws went back from CG to practical. The movie did kept me interest for what is going on, and never I got bored from it. The third act is what most people complained about. To me, I don't think its that bad as what others say. I still think is on par with the first two acts of the movie, and never thought it was that campy. If it was, then maybe the first two acts would be campy, and it be like watching Joel Schumacher's Batman movies. I mean you got to least have some action in the third act, where we do go into a big climax like most other superhero movies. To be honest, I did not grew up with X-Men that much because I was more a Batman fan. I grew up with the show a bit, but not the comics; its just how I see it, and how I feel about it. If you don't like how the third act went that is fine, but I don't think its really that bad. My only problem is that I wish if this movie treats 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' like it never exist, but if its here to stay so be it. 'The Wolverine' is by far my favorite X-Men because I was more intrigued to the Wolverine than any other X-Men characters. If 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' tops this movie, then it might be my favorite. I give 'The Wolverine' a 10 out of 10.UPDATE: I originally give this movie a 9 out of 10, but now I am giving it a 10 out of 10 because I just saw 'X-Men Days of Future Past' in theaters which made my problems go away. See my review for 'X-Men: Days of Future Past,' and no it will not contain any spoilers. Thank you.",10,2,6,18 May 2014
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," It Was Better Than What Critics Are Making Of
","I was originally going to title this review as I quote the same way that Batman said to Superman 'Tell me, Critics, do you bleed? You will?' Instead, I went with the one that you are reading. So far on Rotten Tomatoes, the audience score is at seventy-one percent, and critics are at twenty-nine percent. I understand that everyone has an opinion, and we should all respect that. However, at the same time, critics can go too far with it. I did go see this last week on Saturday, and I thought it was better than what critics are making of. I won't spoil it for you, because you have to see this movie. The premise of the movie picks up after the events of 'Man of Steel,' where Bruce Wayne witnesses the destruction of Metropolis as he notices Superman fighting General Zod and this makes him want to take him down for he had done. Superman receives a lot of mixed words of mouth by the world, and our two beloved superheros start to have a showdown. Heck, when everyone saw 'Man of Steel' they complain about Superman fighting Zod in Metropolis, and couldn't take the fight to anywhere else. So the movie really does address the issues that everyone had as you seen the trailers or read articles about the movie on the internet. By getting to the point, here are the positives that I had with this movie. I thought the story is what it is by having a conflict between Batman and Superman so no need to go into detail about it, and certainly don't want to spoil the movie as what I said previously. The action in this movie is pretty darn good, as the fight between Batman and Superman really does make it worth awhile. The music by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL is really good, while introducing the Batman and Superman theme were all good. The cinematography is beautifully well-filmed, and it is visually stunning. Zack Snyder does a heck of a job to bring this movie to life on the big screen, and making this more of a comic book movie. The movie does feature some nod to Frank Miller's graphic novel 'The Dark Knight Returns,' which I thought that was neat. I do like the costumes for Wonder Woman and Batman, which I thought they were great. Even Superman's. For the cast, Henry Cavill is still, and will always be giving such a great performance as Superman, as well as Amy Adams for playing Lois Lane. Jeremy Irons does a great job as Alfred, which I don't have too much to say about but still he was great. Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor had always got everyone concern about him whether he is good or bad for the role. To me, yes, he is over the top, but at the same time he can also be menacing. So, I say that Eisenberg made a good Lex Luthor. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman is in the movie in a brief role, but I thought she really knocks it out of the park. She really succeeds the role perfectly, and I think fans who read Wonder Woman comic books are going to pleased. Now for Ben Affleck, which had everyone the same way they feel about Michael Keaton as Batman, and thinking he can make this role the weakest link of the movie. Thankfully, he wasn't and he really puts the negative comments to rest. I thought he does an amazing job for his take on Bruce Wayne and Batman, and his Batman is so brutal because his fighting style is like one of those 'Batman: Arkham Asylum' video games. If you like those games, then you will love how he fights in this movie. He is now one of my favorites along side with Michael Keaton, Kevin Conroy and Christian Bale as Batman. The movie is very well paced, and never I find it too long. Now, is it better than or on par with 'Man of Steel?' No. The movie does have some flaws like characterization, which the movie has some but could've used a bit more. Also, I notice parts that may have been edited out because Snyder said that he is going to release his R rated director's cut for the movie. I hope that version is better than what the PG-13 had to offer. So, that is all I can say about this movie. By the way, do yourself one big favor. Don't let those negative reviews get in your way, just go see it with an open mind and then you can judge it on what you have seen. With 'Suicide Squad' on the way, I am sure critics are going to enjoy that film because the movie will have some fun moments. To me, I don't have problem with this movie being dark, and I don't think this universe needs to be like what the Marvel Cinematic Universe did. The DC Extended Universe can be what they want to be, and so will Marvel as they be their own. I really had a fun time with 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,' and now it all leads up to the 'Justice League' movie in two parts. I give this movie a 9 out of 10.",9,6,13,2 April 2016
Space Jam," Brings a lot memories back to my childhood
","'Space Jam' is one of those movies that is part of my childhood aside from the 'Star Wars' movies; 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?;' 'The Wizard of Oz;' and many other movies that I grew up with. Now, by looking back it today, it still holds up and it does bring a lot memories back to my childhood. However, is it up there with 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?'? No. But I still think this is a fun movie for kids and adults to enjoy. 'Space Jam' tells a story in a fictional way that Michael Jordan has retired from being a famous basketball player to become a baseball player like what his father want him to play. When the evil Swackhammer send his Nerdlucks to capture Bugs Bunny and the rest of the Looney Tunes to make them part of their attractions at an amusement park place called Moron Mountain. So Bugs and the rest of the gang decide to challenge them for playing basketball, the Nerdlucks stole Charles Barkley and the other famous NBA player's talents to become the Monstars which it all leads to the Looney Tunes to recruit Jordan to come back playing basketball and to beat the Monstars. I got to say that Michael Jordan's acting isn't that bad as what others say about him. I thought he did well as he is only playing himself, and playing natural as an everyday guy that plays sports and has a family on his own. So, in my opinion, I thought he did good job for not only playing himself, but able to do his own stunts when he is playing basketball. I don't have much thoughts on Wayne Knight's performance, but I thought he did fine. Bill Murray is also fun to watch as he is like Jordan playing himself. Forgot to mention, Danny DeVito was also fun for voicing Swackhammer. Billy West and Dee Bradley Baker both nail their voice acting really well for playing Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. Same goes to other voice actor. Although they are not on par with Mel Blanc, but they were able to remain true on what their voices are suppose to sound like. Of course I got to mention Lola Bunny, I thought she was a great addition to the other Looney Tunes; I know some others reacted negatively that they want her to be like what the Looney Tunes do, but I appreciate her from being different and I do think that she is a perfect love interest to Bugs Bunny. I never saw what 'The Looney Tunes Show' did with her character differently, and not sure how I will feel about that. I thought the special effects in this movie are just as good as what 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' did for its mixture of animation and live action. The basketball court is CGI, but it did not bothered me because I thought it kind of looks like an actual court if it was really there. The bad ones that I know are CG is the Monstars made Michael Jordan look like a basketball, and Wayne Knight's character to be inflated like a balloon until he returns back to his normal size. Aside from the bad ones, most of the special effects are really good. I thought the basketball scene in the last act of the movie is well done. James Newton Howard's score for the film is also well done as well as the film's soundtrack. I love Seal's 'Fly Like an Eagle;' R.Kelly's 'I Believe I Can Fly;' Quad City DJ's 'Space Jam' theme song, and some others. Joe Pytka's direction in this movie was absolutely great, and I thought he handle the basketball scenes as he knows where to point the camera at and how it should be edit. On a side note, I like to mention that Ivan Reitman produce this movie, and Bill Murray makes a joke about how he got to the cartoon world where he mentions a producer that he is friends with and sent a Teamster to drop him off. Nothing important, but I had to bring that up in case if you didn't know about. Anyway, 'Space Jam' is a fun movie and I still enjoy it! I give it a 9 out of 10.",9,2,2,16 November 2014
Saving Mr. Banks," Practically perfect in every way!
","If you enjoy 'Mary Poppins,' then you will enjoy this movie because I love it! 'Saving Mr. Banks' is about an author name, P.L. Travers who travels from London to Los Angeles to work with Walt Disney as they debate some of the ideas to create one of the most beloved films of all time. You already know the history on how the movie 'Mary Poppins' came to be so no need to go into much detail about it because this movie tells you everything on what happened during the behind the scenes of 'Mary Poppins.' Unlike most movies that are based on true events, this movie is the first time to shows the ideas and the creativity beside recreating the sets from a well-known movie like 'Ed Wood' or 'Hitchcock.' The cast in this movie are terrific. Emma Thompson does a great job for playing the author of 'Mary Poppins.' She does start off as a woman that you want to smack her in the face for being too critical on Disney; the songs; and the ideas that the filmmakers were going for. The movie does show her past on how young she was as she was once cute before turning into an unlikable person. However, the more you understand her and the more you feel sorry for her. With that said, Tom Hanks is absolutely remarkable as playing Walt Disney. He did captured the spirit on who and what Disney really is, and remaining true to his character. Colin Farrell and the rest of the cast all did great on their own. Thomas Newman's score is one of his greatest scores that he has ever done in his career. The film's cinematography and its setting is also really beautiful to look at; it really doe have that Disney magic, and it is also fun to see Disneyland in the movie. John Lee Hancock does a fantastic job on directing the movie. My only issue with the movie is the ending, because they never bother to show Travers after showing 'Mary Poppins' to the movie's premiere and tells Disney on how much as she hates the movie, and thinks that it needs to be fixed. After Travers giving her thoughts on the movie, Disney tells her 'Pam, that ship has sailed.' I just thought it would have been something to show, but that is just a minor nitpick. Of course, I understand the filmmakers didn't want the movie to end like that because for what I understand from Thompson's interview is that the movie focuses on Daddy issues which is why they never end on Travers giving her thoughts on the movie. Even Richard Sherman, the man who wrote songs for 'Mary Poppins' and consulting 'Saving Mr. Banks' says that Travers is just a contradicting woman. In most interviews, she would say on how much she hates the movie, and in some rare interviews she would say on how much she enjoy it. So I give that a free pass. Anyway, 'Saving Mr. Banks' is practically perfect in every way! I give it a 10 out of 10!",10,0,2,14 December 2014
Godzilla," Godzilla is back and he is better than ever!
","As you read my review, there will not be any spoilers because I don't want to give too much away or bring up something that I have issues with. I do have one problem with the movie, which I am mixed with but I am keeping my mouth shut. Anyway, that is all I want to mention, and hope you enjoy reading my review. After the other American version of 'Godzilla' that was made back in 1998 by Roland Emmerich, which it disappointed by many fans and considered to be the worst. Maybe not the worst, but there are some other Godzilla movies that aren't good. As I previously mention in my review of the original classic 1954 movie, I have not seen any of the Godzilla movies or the 1998 movie but I wouldn't mind checking them out. With that said, this Godzilla is awesome and really the monster you don't want to mess with. I got a chance to see it for its first screening and really had a fun time. The action is pretty darn good, and Gareth Edwards does a capable job to handle the action as well as directing. The cast did great in this movie. Aaron Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen were fine with there parts, but I give special praises to Ken Watanabe and Bryan Cranston. The music by Alexandre Desplat is very subtle, and some of the scenes work well without music like what the original did. The look of Godzilla looks brilliant, and it is cool to hear his classic roar in this movie. If you haven't seen it yet, check it out because Godzilla is back and he is better than ever! I give it a 10 out of 10!",10,10,22,15 May 2014
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," This Movie Has Chosen Wisely
","After the second Indiana Jones movie being a dark film, Steven Spielberg want the third film to be toned down as a lighter film while being dark for a little bit. If that is not all, Spielberg want to show the human side of Indy, while having a relationship with his father Henry Jones Sr. Anything else? Showing the backstory of Indy as a teenager in 1912 where he gets a scar on his chin as well as being afraid by snakes, using the whip and getting the hat; that was George Lucas' idea, by the way. With that said, the movie takes place in 1938 as Indy goes on an adventure to not only search for the Holy Grail that deals with everlasting eternal life, but to search his father while reconnecting with him. The movie itself is still nowhere near on the same level as 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' but it is about as close as it is ever going to get. Spielberg's direction is really outstanding, and really still keeps his audience to be entertain. The movie is also very well written by Jeffrey Boam. The acting is also fantastic as Harrison Ford is still the best as he is Indiana Jones. No questions ask. I really do enjoy seeing Denholm Elliott and John Rhys-Davies returning as Marcus Brody and Sallah. Alison Doody is also really good as playing Dr. Elsa Schneider, and fun as a bad Indy girl. Julian Glover, on the other hand, is good but sadly not as intimidating as Belloq and Mola Ram. As for Sean Connery, he gave such a delightful performance for bringing humor into the table as well as having a great chemistry with Ford. Can't forget about River Phoenix, who is also really good to play the younger version of Indy. If this movie hadn't feature a young Indy, then there wouldn't be 'The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles' TV show. I've never seen the show, but I might need to give it a look. John Williams' music is really wonderful to hear as you still hear the Indy theme, and hearing the theme of the father and son relationship. The special effects by ILM are terrific, but like the second film there are some effects that look dated. For example, the scene where Indy throws a Nazi officer out of the zeppelin for having no ticket; the officer gets up and yells at a zeppelin as he being filmed against a blue screen. The action scenes are also exciting, and very well handled. 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' is better than the second Indy movie, but still not on par with the first Indy movie. Nevertheless, this movie has chosen wisely. I gave this movie a 9 out of 10. Now the franchise has laid to rest, Indiana Jones will return until 2008 where we have a movie that deals with aliens, nuking in a refrigerator and leaving audiences feeling empty. Stay tuned as I review a movie that really deserves another chance, and that is 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.'",9,0,0,25 September 2016
Back to the Future," One of the best, if not the best about time travel
","It has been thirty years since this movie came out, and has now become a household name as everyone around the world makes references from each scene they reenact, quote lines from each character they say and make parodies out of it. 'Back to the Future' is one of my favorite movies, and it is one of the best if not the best about time travel. There have been plenty of movies about time travel, but when it comes to time travel movies I think of this one. So with said, the movie is about Marty McFly who accidentally goes back in time to 1955 as he alters history by saving his father from getting hit by a car, and his mother for falling in love as well as his existence. So Marty has to put it all back as how things should be, while Doc Brown tries to get Marty back home to 1985. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd do work well together like bread and butter. Lea Thompson looks lovely and she really plays her role really well. The rest of the cast all did great. The movie itself is really funny, and it is also exciting too. The movie doesn't feature that many special effects by ILM, but I love the effects for the car traveling through time just as what it appears in the movie without any time travel sequence like having a portal or something. The design of the DeLorean for being used as a time travel vehicle is really iconic, and loved the way how it looks. The music by Alan Silvestri is so unforgettable, and loved hearing the theme that he created. The movie is very well scripted, and I thought Robert Zemeckis does a really good job on directing this movie after making another movie that is also good 'Romancing the Stone.' The production design for the 1955 scenes are outstanding, and I thought the pacing of the movie is top-notch. I really hope Hollywood doesn't try to remake this or the sequels, because they're fine for what they are; just like what everyone says 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' I have nothing against remakes, but sometimes it just gets lazy for Hollywood to try to come up with some new stories, and new ideas for what movie is there to make. So please, for one last time as I say this 'DON'T REMAKE THIS MOVIE OR THE SEQUELS!' Now I got that out of my way, so now I need to wraps things up with this review, 'Back to the Future' is definitely a classic movie, and really can't say no more about it. I give this movie a 10 out of 10.",10,2,2,21 November 2015
The Birds," 'The Birds' is one of the most shocking and terrifying movies ever made
","After the success 'Psycho,' Alfred Hitchcock turns his next film about birds that attack human nature. Hitchcock thought he was only making a 'B' movie, but when the critics saw it they thought that Hitchcock is too good for making 'The Birds' a 'B' movie. So it now means that 'The Birds' went from a 'B' movie to an 'A' movie. That is very much like when Steven Spielberg thought he was making 'Jaws' a 'B' movie, but it wasn't. I thought the story was great and it really works that there is no need to explain why the birds are attacking and killing people. This suspense of this movie really works, and does its job to not make things laughable. 'The Birds' does keep you on the edge of your seat and wonder if the birds will attack and kill people. There is no music by Bernard Herrmann in this movie, but it does make it more effective when you only hear sounds like birds and such. The special effects in this movie are great, and they do a great job to get the birds into frame when they are attacking. However, I will admit that some of the projector screens are good and some are not, but that is just only a minor nitpick. The cast did wonderful in this movie. I give props to Tippi Hedren, Rod Taylor, Jessica Tandy, and a young Veronica Cartwright. 'The Birds' is one of the most shocking and terrifying movies ever made. I give a 10 out of 10.",10,1,3,9 May 2014
Jurassic Park," This Classic 22 Year Old Movie Is Still Awesome!
","'Jurassic Park' has been around for twenty two years, and it has been one of those movies that has always been part of my childhood and it is definitely one of my all time favorite movies. This is the best of best, because none of the sequels lived up to the original. So the story is about an old man name John Hammond, who invites three doctors alongside with a lawyer to show them that dinosaurs are alive and real, and shows them how they were actually created after they were extinct sixty five million years ago (If anyone knows math on what I just typed). So he sets up a tour for them, but things go haywire as dinosaurs start to break loose when the power goes out during the storm, and it is a chance for our main characters to survive and to get off an island that is filled with dinosaurs. I did not see on the big screen back in 1993, but only saw it on home video. However, I was able to have the opportunity to see it on the big screen, but only this time in 3D as it came out back in 2013 for honoring the film's twentieth anniversary and I really had a blast to see it like I never had before. I love this movie, and it just never ages for me. To me, it feels timeless as if this movie was made today or any other time that was made. Of course, this movie was famous for its use of groundbreaking digital technology, and I know many filmmakers when nuts about this and it does upset many people that they choose to use CGI over practical effects. Although not many filmmakers overuse CGI as they decide to remain old school, but still use CGI if its done right. With that said, I thought it had a very good story from beginning to end as you first introduce the characters, then you show the island and how it went wrong, and you see how these characters are able to survive. The characters are very good, and likable at the same time. Sam Neill; Jeff Goldblum; Laura Dern and Richard Attenborough all gave out such terrific performances on their own; they may not be three dimensional, but there is still enough characterization in the movie and still to care about. The two child actors all did great too. The movie is filled with wonders, excitements and having some pretty good actions. Steven Spielberg has made such beautiful looking movie, and knows how to make a movie about how much we like about dinosaurs. John Williams' music is so darn memorable, and it is completely unforgettable. The special effects done by Stan Winston Studios and Industrial Light & Magic are top notch perfect for the use of practical and CGI effects. They continue to look impressive as I watch it, and it never feels dated for my own personal taste. If I had to pick what is my favorite dinosaur, I would say the T-Rex which it is obvious that everyone loves the T- Rex. I do love the scene where we first meet T-Rex as it has perfect build up that is perfectly suspense, and it is perfectly well edited together. Heck, the movie doesn't bored me and it was always keeps my interest. The ending that everyone remembers when the T- Rex saves Dr. Grant and the others by Raptors was awesome. I do love how the movie ends, where they finally go home in a helicopter and it gives you that good feeling as Williams' music plays along as the movie ends. I love 'Jurassic Park' so much, and this classic twenty two year old movie is still awesome! I give it a perfect 10 out of 10.",10,3,4,14 June 2015
The Wizard of Oz," A Film For All Ages
","'The Wizard of Oz' is one of my favorite movies growing up as a child, and to this day; it is considered to be timeless. Everyone knows the story, characters, music, magic, fun, etc. This is a very memorable movie because again everyone knows the movie very well. The movie is based on L. Frank Baum's book, and there had been many adaptations for 'The Wizard of Oz' which it was during the silent film era; so I guess you can say if the movie that I'm reviewing is somewhat like a remake of the original silent movies or not. I know that the movie had went many production changes along with the original director Richard Thorpe getting fired for lacking the movie's spirit. So now that we have what Dorothy Gale looks along with the Scarecrow, Tin Man, Lion, and the Wicked Witch of the West. Also, Victor Fleming taking over the director's chair for making such a wonderful looking movie, and making OZ look beautiful in Technicolor. I do know that he did not direct the Kansas scenes because of his commitment to work on another production from MGM studio's 'Gone With The Wind,' which I never saw and don't know if I should see it. Maybe I should but I still don't know because I felt that movie stole the Oscar for Best Picture for not letting 'The Wizard of Oz' win, but I digress. As I was saying about the Kansas scenes, they were pretty much much filmed by King Vidor. With that said, I thought the cast were perfect, and they do manage to bring their roles to life. Judy Garland is Dorothy Gale and she will always be remembered for playing that kind of role. Ray Bolger was fantastic as the Scarecrow along with Jack Haley as the Tin Man and Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion. Margaret Hamilton does a memorable job to played the evil Wicked Witch of the West. The production design in this movie are sensational, and it does look a place where anyone fantasize in their own world away from their home. The cinematography is beautifully well shot for OZ being filmed in Technicolor, and the Kansas scenes being filmed in a Sepia tone. The special effects in this movie are quite special for the used of matte paintings; witch being melted; holographic head of the Wizard of Oz; and most of all the tornado. The tornado itself looks really good before there was any CGI by today's special effects. The movie 'Twister' from 1996 does used CGI for the Tornado, while this movie was all done practically. The songs in this movie are indeed memorable such as 'We're off to see the Wizard;' 'If I only had a Brain;' 'If I only had a Heart;' 'If I only had the Nerve;' and everyone's favorite 'Over the Rainbow.' The movie never gets tiring, and anyone can watch this movie as much as they want to because the movie's premise along with the pacing goes by very well. I wish I can say more about this movie, but everyone who has seen this movie had already said about what makes this movie so special. As of that, they are very much right. After this movie was made, there were more 'OZ' movies that appear on the big screen as 'The Wiz' based on its play which it is not a good movie and never saw the play. Also, there were two more 'OZ' movies that were made by Disney such as 'Return of Oz' and 'Oz the Great and Powerful.' Those were good movies, but none of them were as good as the original timeless classic. 'The Wizard of Oz' is never going to die, and it will live on forever. This is a film for all ages for both children and adults. As Dorothy would say 'There is no place like,' to me I say 'There is no great OZ movie like this one.' I give 'The Wizard of Oz' a perfect 10 out of 10.",10,6,7,15 August 2014
