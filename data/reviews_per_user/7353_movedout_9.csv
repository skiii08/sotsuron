"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Broadly funny, just lacks the wit to take it to the next level
","It's strange to see Simon Pegg go from subverting clichés to embracing a film so riddled with them and even more surprisingly, with his tongue nowhere to be seen near his cheek. Somewhere along the way, Pegg and his fellow scribe, one of the funniest people in the world (in my very humble opinion), Michael Ian Black forgot that they started writing a parody of rom-com/underdog/sports films and instead just went through the motions of making yet another trite and thoroughly conventional feel-good sapfest. And to be fair to Black, his script was rewritten by Pegg to take place in London instead of its original Los Angeles setting and anglicised to follow suit. Take a closer look and you might see director David Schwimmer's name nestled between Pegg and his co-star Thandie Newton.'Run Fatboy Run' begins as if it was the day after a Happily Ever After in an unlikely romantic comedy. Deadbeat Dennis (Pegg) is moments away from getting married to Lovely Libby (Newton), a smart and ambitious beauty way above his station who he's gotten pregnant. What does a spineless buffoon do other than run? Literally, away from her, the presiding minister, friends and family. Six years later, the shame from that moment of cowardice forms the very fundamentals of Dennis's life: unhealthy, insecure, broke, undependable and without prospects. The one bright spark left over is a cordial relationship with Libby and a relatively affectionate one with their young son, Jake (Matthew Fenton). Dennis's life on the precipice is shaken when Libby introduces her seemingly perfect new American boyfriend Whit (Hank Azaria) who's successful, financially secure, considerate and ready for a long-term relationship. Faced with a future without Libby and Jake, Dennis attempts to prove to those around him that he can follow through with his promises by running the same marathon as Whit.Pegg gives a strong showing here and shows that he's not only naturally funny and self-effacing but a decent actor. Schwimmer does well to frame his shots at Pegg by showing his face and expressions as he reacts to things around him that he's shown to be powerless to control. We start to believe him when he finally understands that Libby is the love of his life, as opposed to being someone he hopes to selfishly possess, and in these very small ways, we get a main character that's real enough to root for. Pegg also knows the score when he's in his element. He's fearless when it comes to the paunchy physicality of the role  the schoolyard chases, the training montages as he heaves and hos  but is also verbally adroit enough to deliver some genuine zingers.Pegg doesn't get to have the only laugh here. The film populates a sleazy best friend, Gordon (Dylan Moran) and an ingratiating Indian landlord, Mr. Ghoshdashidar (Harish Patel) around Dennis's objective of completing the marathon. Moran is a scene-steal by all regards. He delivers the best lines and is filled with the unpredictable, wacky comic energy that's conspicuously left restrained in the rest of the film. While a riot, Patel always stays one joke shy from being an offensively stereotype and slots in well the rest of the cast.Perhaps a victim of the rewrite, the film finds its way close to pandering double takes and uneven characterisations, most conspicuously in the handling of Whit who's at once faultless and perilously villainous at others. The tired scent of mediocrity rears the closer the film inches towards its hokey pay-off and you've suddenly got a film that's so much lesser than the sum of its parts.",6,2,5,2 April 2008
Sucker Punch," Incredible visuals; imagery that will stay etched in your mind for a long time
","'Sucker Punch,' the latest barrage on the senses from writer-director Zack Snyder ('300', 'Watchmen') is his first film that's based on his own source material. And it proves to be quite stunning definition of pop filmmaking. In a triumphant marriage of style and tone, Snyder has created his own 'Kill Bill' by going deep down into the rabbit hole. A glorious pastiche of colour, CGI and kinesis, 'Sucker Punch' even through its obvious flaws, has set a new bar for graphic storytelling that attempts to transplant the purity of imagination onto the cinema screen.Essentially cohering around a simple premise -- hot chicks kicking ass and taking names, the film's bravura opening charts Baby Doll's (Emily Browning) institutionalisation by a wicked stepfather after her mother's death and her introduction to the asylum where damaged young women are sent to be kept away from society. She meets the people-in-charge, Blue (Oscar Isaac) and Dr. Gorski (Carla Gugino) as well as the other girls in the institute: Rocket (Jena Malone) and her sister Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Amber (Jamie Chung) and Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens).The story that follows Baby Doll reveals a larger canvas of a clever narrative conceit that coincides three realities together ('Inception' comparisons, tread lightly); the first being the asylum, the second is a burlesque brothel run by Blue and trained by Gorski and the final and most resplendent one is Baby Doll's hyper reverie focused on destroying the forces of evil -- be it shogun titans, zombie Nazis or killer androids. The darker the reality preceding it, the deeper and more risky the wormhole of fantasies go. There is a real sense, despite its tremendous parade of visual set-pieces that Snyder wanted a narrative strong enough to endure the weight of spectacle, and in many respects he has. He uses the age-old device of character quests to propel the plot, peppering it with familiar consequences until he doesn't. The flow culminates in an intriguing final act that sets it a mark higher than anyone would have expected, or even needed from a film that already proudly wears its stripes as pure escapist entertainment.Snyder goes the way of Tarantino in appropriating and amalgamating artistic and stylistic influences from the most conspicuous of genres and mediums. Within the real world or whatever the relative equivalent of what exists in this film's dark and twisty tone, the film uses templates in the vein of sexploitation female prison grind-house features from the 60s and 70s like 'Love Camp 7', '99 Women', 'Caged Heat' and the grandmother of them all, 1950's 'Caged'. As the film progresses into its action-oriented enterprises, it quickly recalls the dizzying array of cut-scenes from video-games and punk anime-style design in how it encompasses the digital environment. Snyder's thematic goal is to situate the idea of imagination as a coping mechanism for terror, a concept seen recently in 'Pan's Labyrinth' and 'Tideland'. The landscape of the mind is uniquely realised here by Snyder, who etches a remarkable amount of detail into each CGI frame, an hyperbolised celebration of artifice and invention that is at once magnificent and exhilarating as it is compelling and spellbinding.Werner Herzog once posited that the dearth of new and unique imagery that do not reflect the times we live in will be the death of civilisation. If anything, 'Sucker Punch' truly defines the generation of filmmaking we exist in -- a sophisticated and passionate emblem that delivers an overload of sugar high through the ideals of creating and maintaining a creative medley of pop-culture influences, bridged together with keen commercial sensibilities. Suddenly, Snyder holding on to the helms of the next Superman film makes more sense than it ever did.",8,410,718,23 March 2011
I'm Not There," One of the most memorable American filmic exercises of 2007
","On route to redefining the modern biopic, Todd Haynes has also made one of the most memorable American filmic exercises of the past year by fusing style, substance while finally being percipient on Bob Dylan's once mythic hipster groove. A cast list that drew bated breaths is also one that complements Haynes's dauntless reach beyond the boundaries of narratives, performances and subject. His portrait of Dylan, is an interwoven collage of inhabited incarnations that not only pays tribute to a singular artist's personal and social identities, but to the many instances of creative process and its resulting capricious chaos that have left its slippery mark in our minds and as such, is as much about Todd Haynes as it is about Bob Dylan. With droll narrative swagger reminiscent of Todd Solondz's equally mind-bending 'Palindromes', where multiple actors play a single character through different forms and times, Haynes gleefully glides through the eras, remarking on the cults of celebrity that have defined them and the fantasia we prefer to remember.",Null,0,1,4 April 2008
Black Book," Easily Paul Verhoeven's most enjoyable and breezily entertaining films in years
","Only Paul Verhoeven could make another WWII film seem so fresh, audacious and altogether exhilarating by throwing in a strong religious subtext, simmering vulgarity, high-wire espionage and an unsparingly transgressive moral compass in which the Nazis weren't the only arseholes left in the war. But it's even more remarkable that Verhoeven, without missing a beat, vigorously fits in his brand of bold meta-satire and subversive political thought (by way of his 'Starship Troopers' allegory being retooled) into a tightly written and highly toned script. The director's tenacious motif is his hilariously hyper-extended, overplayed melodramatics and luminously lit men and women  hungering with sexual evocation  filtered through the complexities of a ethical grey area visualised through nebulous clouds of cigarette smoke. The film adheres towards several key components, but coheres around one theme: Verhoeven has Old Hollywood in his sights.The relative, tenuous calm of Israel in 1956 is captured as a tour bus pulls up to witness the quaintness of a kibbutz but gives way to a surprising reunion between wartime chums. A flashback beckons as a distressed Rachel Stein (Carice van Houten) proceeds to sit by a body of water and remember her life as a chanteuse called Ellis de Vries back in Holland, 1944-1945. With a family butchered in cold blood by a SS swine, Rachel joins the Resistance against the Nazis. Her natural good looks, the talent for both song and deceit inform the decision to send her deep into enemy regime, seducing a handsome and sensitive Gestapo up-and-comer (Sebastian Koch) and retrieve secrets vital to the reclamation of the homeland. This could be easily retitled 'Lust, Caution', if it weren't for the film's voluptuously photographed and energetic direction of being a sobering thrill-a-minute, briskly paced actioner, more focused on its dramatic reversals of fortunes than it is about the genre's predilection for the elevation of its us-versus-them narratives and its inherent gravitas.Like Verhoeven's greatest films, the female soma, inclusive of its complicated psyche and prevailing impulses, form the centrepiece of his film. And in 'Black Book', van Houten as Rachel glows incandescent like a genuine Hollywood heroine, a classically beautiful movie starlet  an arresting Jean Harlow impersonate  playing her assigned role as Aryan siren to sleek perfection with the profound sadness of an identity implicitly becoming lost. But Rachel/Ellis is a creature of intense fortitude. Her instincts are sure and steadfast, traversing distances with dauntless reach, a woman of innate elegance and of the vicissitudes that come with suppressed desire. These fierce motivations and fully cognisant volition are incited by the inner rebellions formed as a Jewish femme in wartime Holland, caught in the middle of Nazi oppression and the Christian puritans ('if only the Jews had just listened to Jesus') she takes shelter with as she's forced to hold a Bible for meals or the matter-of-fact abuses she takes on the chin when the leader of the Resistance remarks, 'When is a Jew's life worth more than a good Dutchman?' An intuitive provocateur, Verhoeven charts the morass though prurient sexual encounters and base survival instincts while gleefully chafing the absurdly graphic with the warm humanism buried in his more outrageous oeuvre. The modulation between a tasteful recreation of the period and a modernist take on genre conventions by feeding off its own historical context provides the centrifugal force of the film's queries into the roles of liberators, oppressors and other postwar manifestos.",9,3,7,13 May 2008
Gone Baby Gone," Gets under your skin and stays there
","Boston resides in the marrow of the Afflecks. Ben Affleck directs his younger brother Casey to an arduously plaintive performance as an amateur Boston gumshoe in his adaptation of novelist Dennis Lehane's 'Gone Baby Gone', a film that is so quietly accumulative in power when its collapses in morality become tangled in its web of inescapable rot, and where those who seem to have good in them always get hurt.When 4 year-old Amanda McCready is abducted from her working-class Dorchester home, her aunt and uncle (Amy Madigan and Titus Welliver) 'augment' the limp search conducted by the police when she hires local detectives Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and his girlfriend Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) to sift though the neighbourhood and extract information from its distrusting merchants and volatile proles. The elder Affleck adroitly portrays Boston's inherent tribalism and rotting facades with the duo's tortured investigations through the diseased surfaces that recede from the pale daylight into shadows and grime, and eventually through the city's underground of venality so terrible a thing to imagine that it gets under your skin and stays there.Closer to an affecting study of unravelling communal drama than a riveting crime piece, this urban notturno draws on its mileage when the investigation into the little girl's disappearance reveals dark secrets and a trail that leads in circles, discovering more than what they sought to know about themselves. Characters like the girl's mother, a social parasite named Helene (played fiercely by a noteworthy Amy Ryan), balances and evocates the film's residual outrage and pity for its ravaged denizens. Further populated by magnificent performances from Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman as jaded cops, it lends Affleck's directorial debut a confident swagger that allows focus on the material, so unafraid of disturbing its audience, to keep patience in its mauling eruptions of nihilism.There's both a deepness of procedurals and an authenticity of time and place in the script's constant turning of the screw, the narrative wheels churn as damaged children and ineffectual adults begin to take the stage. It just gets darker and more intense in the film's inspection of gnarled human nature, and the reasons that coerce it is at the centre of its slow-burning style, giving it an effectively sustained dramatic tension as its moral convictions become no less irreducible.Ben Affleck's ambitious and unremittingly desolate purview of his turbulent city is never intellectualised, but instead remains meticulously modulated to the emotional resonance of Kenzie as he journeys from one stinging moral decision to another, evincing the confluence of conundrums that's entrenched into the very fibres of the people we are and aspire to be. 'Gone Baby Gone' presents to us how warped and strident individual instinctive moralities can be and what the right thing truly entails in a world that remains unresponsive to the inner cries of the film's palpitating bleakness.",8,2,4,31 January 2008
Mamma Mia!," Irrepressible camp, purely entertaining  flaws and all
","Stage director Phyllida Lloyd's film debut knows exactly what it is and what it means to a clamouring fanbase worldwide. Already one of the biggest ever musicals ever put to stage  consistently selling out Broadway and the West End, its translation to the screen is now poised to be the biggest film musical of all time through its knack of reaching across generations (a theme that runs through the film) through a timeless soundtrack and the rare ability to garner repeat business. The film's force of showmanship is distinctive all right, and to be sure, 'Mamma Mia!' utilises the preternaturally addictive ABBA catalogue to clever use by never veering far from its showcase tunes of instantly recognisable anthems. But there's a much more crucial factor to its commercial success than its inherently gratifying, time-tested Europop extravaganza, and that would seem to be how the viewing experience energises audiences into a frenzy before, during and after the film.Each of them  and you know who you are  on a certain level view 'Mamma Mia!' as a sort of audience participation, seen in the likes of originals like 'The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert', 'Cabaret', 'Grease', 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show', 'Hairspray' (circa 1988) and of course, its spiritual predecessor, 'Xanadu'. These films trade heavily on their camp sensibilities and tacky production numbers that go above a natural tolerance for kitsch and the hysterical. You'd be hard-pressed to not find shoes tapping, fingers strumming invisible chords and sotto voce singing at a screening room. This collective spirit of celebration, the utter gaiety of being apart of a harmonious thread is apparent everywhere in the film, particularly when a Greek chorus becomes suddenly apparent as its impressive array of acting talent attempt to sing their way out of paper bags.What you hear is what you get. Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Julie Walters, Stellan Skarsgard and its young lead, Amanda Seyfried are shoehorned into singing roles. The uninspired, contrived, threadbare story that strings most of ABBA's Top 20 hits together revolves around a soon-to-be-wed Sophie's (Seyfried) attempts to bring three men (Brosnan, Firth, Skarsgard) to the small, idyllic Greek island of Kalokairi for the very purpose of rooting out which of them is her biological father by bringing them face to face with her feisty single mother Donna played by an indomitable Streep. Never you mind its absolute farce of a premise, just admire its sheer audacity of even attempting it.Steeped in mediocrity, the film is a dissonant fuse of feckless film-making and unqualified brio. Lloyd underdirects every aspect of the film by playing it safe, giving way to an overly effusive and overly acted emoting by its usually terrific cast, proving that even the best of them stumble over tricky song-and-dance material. Brosnan gives a muscular performance even through throaty recitals, but Streep surprises with an impassioned salvo. But the musical performances have a delightfully novel quality of a night at a karaoke bar with awkward uncles and drunken mothers. They are rough around the edges, but remain charming, proving that not everything equates to the sum of its parts. 'Mamma Mia!' wants to be an experience to be relished, with an intrinsic need to convert the unconverted by its purely stupendous force of ardent spectacle and delirious pizazz.",8,2,5,17 September 2008
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," '...undeniable parallels to contemporary deliberations about the conflict in the Middle East..'
","'The Wind That Shakes the Barley' is Ken Loach's latest ode to those that had to betray their better angels for something they more or less believed in. Staunchly socialist and drawing criticisms for his success in Cannes, Loach thankfully refuses to pander to both sides. He sticks to his figurative guns by unapologetically crafting a one-sided view on a subject that he feels confident in, much like 'Land and Freedom'. It does not support so much as condemn and shows how the violent trajectory of the IRA's policies and actions throughout the years came to be. In the end, it is not so much the political polemic as many as claim or hope it is, but a pointed political examination of the dread that war drums up amidst the quixotic ideals of patriotism and martyrdom.An occupation starts to take shape in 1920s, Ireland when the British send in their military squads known as the Black and Tans. The film is keen to point out that these soldiers are remnants of the cruelty that World War I had left in its wake. The much-reviled British soldiers are caricatured as brutes, but in truth, they give off a sense of desperate senselessness by reluctantly laying their humanity on the line for a cause not all of them believe in. And that can very well be said for the Republicans as well. There are no winners. There are no saviours. There are only choices to be made. The lines that are crossed define these characters.The full-blooded cinematography is in stark contrast to the gray, bleak world that is being depicted. A quick check shows the unsurprising inclusion of frequent Loach collaborator, Barry Ackroyd, responsible for its masterful cinematography. Its pastoral simplicity is engulfed in a complex battle of principles as blood is shed indiscriminately upon its meadows. Hillside ambushes amidst the foliage lead to stained verdure and the deathly calm aftermath as the survivors tally the casualties. It starts to eat away at the vigilance of these men as it hauntingly signifies what's to come.Soon the subterfuge, clandestine assassinations and abuse their womenfolk receive by protecting them start to take their toll on these men. As soon as a truce is called, many of them rejoice even though they know that they are still not truly sovereign. But at least the violence ceases and the impunity lifted over the despicable abuses of power. The Anglo-Irish Peace Treaty is signed, forming the Irish Free State that remains under the dominion of the British Empire, and strictly loyal to the monarchy. Teddy, jaded from fighting the good fight, chooses the respite from the constant struggle. To complicate matters further, Damien is adamant that a truly independent state will only come if they shake off the British shackles. They are pitted against each other's perfidy as tragic and powerful metaphors fuel the backdrop of their waning ambitions, slowly finding themselves fighting against something and forgetting what they were initially fighting for.It rescinds on Michael Collins's historical role in establishing the Irish Free State, Loach takes the unorthodox approach in dismantling the self-serving romanticised paradox of freedom fighting from within. The terms, oppressors and victims are routinely switched around. Casual as that sounds, it truly signifies the futility of violence for the sake of ideology. They constantly feud while on the same side as the gasconading bravado of its masculine characters threaten to implode their united and spirited response towards their occupiers. It does begin by not fully romanticising the idea of rebellion and justice being served swiftly and without recrimination. But the temptation to do so never full dissipates as a burgeoning romance grows between Damien and Sinead (Orla Fitzgerald), a fiery character opposed to the aggression that ensues on both sides. Loach lingers on the violence and the cost of uprising against a battle that is there to be lost. The shots are measured from a distance, mourning the circumstances. Gracefully mixing up a downbeat sense of loss with a blend of impassioned rhetoric and cinematic brutality, it accomplishes an appropriately funereal atmosphere in each of its scenes.Time passes arbitrarily, while observing the ad hoc building of plans and situations, which is viewed with underwhelming anticipation. There is something so disconnecting in its quick scene after powerful scene. While the dialogue is seemingly crisp and natural between the Republicans, it is also unusually fast and highly derivative, commanding all attention. The dependence of the dialogue and inherently dragging pace threatens to overpower the raw intensity of the actions. The latter half does tend to veer towards melodrama, and over-wrought scenes of verbose, passionate speeches strangely switches allegiances of the fighters at the drop of a dime. It is most convincing, not by its words but by its actions as clearly seen in its opening minutes. That single event polarises young Damien into the politicised man we follow throughout the film.Recreated with such insight and groundwork, his commitment shines through at every level. As with all his films, the ardent and sincere look at politics through his characters distinguishes them as people caught in a whirlpool of despair. They show lament, fear and even some apathy to the choices they have before them.It draws undeniable parallels to contemporary deliberations about the conflict in the Middle East and insurgency against the US and Britain. There is a distinct disgust at the idea of militarism and clerical influence in the state. The urban guerilla freedom fighters are just ordinary folk caught in a landslide of activism, straddling the thin line overflowing with brutality and the excruciating agony of guilt while not becoming intoxicated by the violence. Entrenched with the 'an eye for an eye' dogma, it signifies the mutually ruinous end of all. By accentuating the power of choices, it prods us to witness the inner struggle of finding a footing in the slippery slopes of warfare.",8,2,4,9 October 2006
Defiance," Stupendously manipulative
","Edward Zwick continues giving backhanded Hollywood compliments to oppressed minorities in the 'Defiance', headlined by the newly minted A-list presence in Daniel Craig as a blond-haired, blue-eyed saviour to hunted Jews in 1941 Belarus. Just as in 'Glory', 'The Last Samurai' and most egregiously in 'Blood Diamond,' Zwick finds little but potent ways of insulting his through a veil of good intentions and it doesn't show signs of stopping here. But surprisingly, Zwick manages to create a grim world here based on true events and characters  making it more than a little affecting  set in the claustrophobic forests, brought down to earth with swirling ideas about the price of survival in a time hardly worth living in.For all its over-the-top pitches, it is stupendously manipulative in how much effective pathos it wrings out of its leading men. It revolves around a dynamic of quiet anger and deep convictions to what four brothers believe should be the best way to lead their people into the brighter light that they know has to shine one of these days. The eldest, Tuvia Bielski (Craig) advocates an agrarian society that depends on a more defensive approach of elusive subsistence of growing, stealing and rationing food. His two youngest siblings, Asael Bielski (Jamie Bell) and Aron Bielski (George MacKay) join this form of resistance. However, Zus Bielski (Liev Schreiber)  by far the most appealing character  chooses to fight back with the help of the scheming remnant Soviet Army, at times even letting his desire for continued vengeance obscure the idea of his identity in a period when that's all that is needed to be exterminated.At its most melancholic, 'Defiance' asks questions of the deep paradoxes in being Jewish. It questions, quite relevantly, the necessity of killing in order to survive  a raid on Nazis is juxtaposed with a joyous wedding of young Jews  and the expendability of present humanity to preserve future generations. But for its entire story's intrinsic worth, Zwick does bring a sledgehammer approach to most of the proceedings. When Nazis or Jews aren't getting gunned down, the silence is filled with rousing speeches on valour in the face of adversity, romantic gazes and religious iconography (courtesy of an old rabbi) of Moses/Tuvia leading his people towards the Promised Land. It does draw away the idea of victimisation and fatality of a Nazi period film but doesn't do very much to create a lasting intent of realism, just the pursuit of idealism.",6,7,15,3 February 2009
The Pursuit of Happyness," Hollywood emotional impulses ring hollow
","It is important to note that The Pursuit of Happiness is ostensibly a rags to riches story, despite spending almost its entire runtime kicking Smith's ass and just generally be a real downer. Unfortunately, there's no room at all for Smith's personality to shine through, and then from there it's almost as if he's more concerned about getting an elusive acting trophy. While the child thesp is a real find being Smith's son, his verbosity eventually gets annoying succumbing into the trap many young actors fall into.As for it's auxillary messages (every movie like this needs at least the one), it really doesn't get much through considering that every stranger Smith's character meets seems sorta pleasant, polite or just plain ignorant but most strikingly, with no preconceptions of race and class being highlighted despite Gardner's background. It just shows Chris Gardner as a good man, great father, even better worker who's just unfairly yet to find a place in this nice little world. As for it being a comedy, the only thing jaunty about this film is the spiteful little percussion that plays as a frantic Gardner runs after his livelihood time and time again. Very calculating. Very cloying.",6,1,1,3 March 2007
