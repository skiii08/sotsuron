The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Well For a Person waiting for something to happen
","Sorry guy...There is No Stallone or Van Dame to make something happen.This is a true top of the line beginning of an epic trilogy.  I am sure I am not overstating this either.  I never saw LOTR in the theatre because I was skeptical of it.  I bought the DVD and must say it was a GREAT film and I can not wait to see The Twin Towers come December.  My GF and I will be there this time to see it.  She loved LOTR as well ( and no, we are not nerds or geeks or anyone who plays RPG's) We are just people who notice great films.  I watch IFC all the time....",8,1,2,14 November 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Well Aidy curious
","If you did not like the first WHY go see the second and leave the same basic post?The movie is basically a 3 hour movie kid,  Nothing will change.  Dont bother seeing the Return of the KingOh my god what a waste",9,0,0,28 December 2002
Black Hawk Down," Aww come on Foreshead and a snoozer? OMG
","What do you want,, a love story? A little political intervention? typical UK'erThis movie was about a battle, a big screw up by the US forces and that alone.  This is none of these things because this is not what happened. Yes there is some fiction (i.e. was no Grimes Ewen Mgregor's character etc etc) included in the movie and character molding of a few into one. However this movie does justice to what happened and to those who fought and died with heroic actions.  It all happened so fast and there was no time to think once the first Black Hawk went down.  They did not have air support other than the other copters.  There was no fantasy ending or happiness.  It is just a 2 hour movie about a much publicized battle.  they technically could have made another movie just on Michael Durant alone.I think ridley Scott did a magnificent job portraying what went down In october of 1993.  Listening to actual Rangers and or Delta Force praise the actors and ridley Scott for what was done in this movie  was a nice thing to see.Definitely a must see and a top 10 favorite of mine10/10Peace all and God Bless",9,0,0,10 June 2003
