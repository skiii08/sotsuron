Despicable Me 2," Not so Despicable at all
","In a perfect world or in movie-world there is a clear line between good and bad, hero and villain. Well, lives isn't that black and white, nor are the movies now for that matter. Why can't we have a bad guy who is good as well? Movies have already dabbled in the anti-hero, so I think it is time for the lovable villain, or at least one who has a heart. I am not talking about having the next James Bond villain want to take Mr. Bond for ice cream instead of killing him. What I want is someone like Gru (Steve Carell), a bad guy who discovers his heart, but still has that evil streak in him. In 2010's 'Despicable Me' we were introduced to Gru as he tried to take over the world, only to have his life taken over by three little girls. These girls Agnes (Elsie Fisher), Margo (Miranda Crosgrove) and Edith (Dana Gaier) malted Gru's heart and made him not want to be so evil. In fact Gru is out of the 'Evil' business now and he no longer has his minions preparing for world domination, instead he has them making jam. Super villains are still out there, and one of them has stolen a formula that could cause the world problems if they are not found soon. So how do you catch a super villain you ask? You use an ex super villain to track them down. The Anti Villain League recruits Gru and teams him with Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig). Together they must find the mystery villain and save the world from whatever evil plan he has in store for us all. It seems that most animated movies now are just franchises waiting to happen. Even the mighty Pixar has started to return to the well more often. Why does it seem every animated movie has a sequel now? Well it is pretty simple. Dollar signs. Unlike most sequels though, animated movie's quality can stay relatively the same. Maybe it is because they keep it simple, they don't try to outdo the first film, and they just make a good movie. In the case of 'Despicable Me 2' they don't let you down, they bring the same laughs as the first film. Stephen Carell is great as Gru, but the minions once again steal the show. Who don't love a little yellow guy who always seems to want to do well by his boss, but always seems to cause trouble. It's like watching those old Saturday morning cartoons, waiting to see what the minions will get themselves into. The other thing about this film is the 3D looks good, especially as you watch the credits sequence. I look forward to animated movie sequels, because the filmmakers who make them know what they are. These movies are suppose to be fun, something the whole family can enjoy, and with 'Despicable Me 2' they did what they were suppose to do, make a fun movie.http://the2cinemen.blogspot.com/",7,0,0,2 July 2013
Insidious: Chapter 2," Things that go bump in the night
","When you are making a horror movie it always helps to have a few things around in the movie in order to help set the mood. Things like creaky old doors, a piano, and preferably an old and creepy looking house. Now these are not absolutes, but they can help for sure. Horror movies are not like other movies, because there are so many possibilities for sequels, just look at the 'Friday the 13th' series. In 2011 James Wan and Leigh Whannell brought us 'Insidious', a story about a family that had unwelcome visitors in their house. The supernatural kind. That family, the Lamberts, have gotten away from their house and the experience they had in it. Josh (Patrick Wilson), Renai (Rose Byrne), and their three children are all safe and move in with Josh's mom. At the beginning of the film you find out this is not Josh's fist experience with a sprit. It seems Josh has a gift where he sees dead people and with the help from Elise (Lin Shaye) he forgets that gift, until he uses it again to save his son from a place the living shouldn't be. That place I imagine is the same place Carol Anne from 'Poltergeist' was in as well, but instead of talking through a TV, a tin can phone is used to communicate to the other side. Renai senses something is not right about Josh, a sentiment that is shared by Josh's mother as well. So with the help from a man named Carl (Steve Coulter) and two guys who provide the comic relief, they all set out to free Josh and his family from the evil that haunts them. The story picks up exactly where the first film ended, which makes the chapter 2 a perfect title. There are so many more possible chapters to this story, because let's face it there are a lot of ghosts out there. 'Insidious: Chapter 2' is part ghost story and part detective story, as we try to unravel what is following the Lamberts around. Lucky, unlike what he did with 'Saw' we are still under the direction of James Wan and he keeps us on the same path as the first film. If you are going for jump out of your seat frights, then this is not the film for you. There are some moments that may make you jump a little, thanks to some good camera work, but this movie is more like 'Seven' than say, 'The Conjuring'. In a genre that seems to be getting everything right at the moment, 'Insidious: Chapter 2' doesn't disappoint. The only thing that could improve, is to have a little less common sense moments, you know those moments where a character does the thing everyone knows they shouldn't. I think it is very fitting to release this film on Friday the 13th, because like that franchise, you hope this one also has a long life making us afraid to sleep with the lights off.Brian Taylor http://the2cinemen.blogspot.com/",Null,36,62,12 September 2013
About Time," About Time a great romantic comedy
","When I get together with my friends sometimes we always have the discussion that I think most people have with their friends. That conversations about what super power you would choose if you could choose one, oh wait that is just me and my friends? Anyway the one thing I wish I could do is to be able to travel back in time. I don't want to be able to change history, just to be able to have a redo on something I did. Well that will never happen, but is exactly what 'About Time' is about.Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) has just turned 21 and his father (Bill Nighy) has a family secret to tell him. It is nothing like something evolving a dark secret in their past, the secret is that the men of their family can travel back in time. This secret is met with disbelief and doubt and of course the desire to find out if it is true. Tim decides to go back to the night before at his parents New Year's Eve party and kisses a girl at midnight, something he missed on the first time. What would you do with such a gift? Get rich? Make your life perfect? For Tim his choice is to use it for love. Tim now armed with this new ability heads to London to start his life, and to find his true love. It is not long after that he meets Mary (Rachel McAdams) and Tim uses his gift to correct his mistakes in his courting of her. Tim and Mary start a life together and a family, and Tim discovers that living everyday to its fullest is truly the secret for a happy life.I know what you are thinking a love story about time travel, 'The Time Traveler's Wife' all over again. Well I have good news for you, even though they both have Rachel McAdams in common, that is the only thing they share. What makes 'About Time' different? Well that is simple it is written and directed by Richard Curtis (Love Actually). Curtis knows how to tell a love story, he just seems to make the relationships in his movie feel real. We have all heard the 'only in the movies' line before, but Curtis makes it feel real. 'About Time' has that feeling, from the awareness of the first time meeting someone, to the feeling you get when you meet the right person. As good as Curtis's material is, it would all be for nothing if it didn't have the right actors. Gleeson and McAdams are magical together, and you can't help to especially enjoy Gleeson's preference. There are so many movies dealing with love and relationships that come out every year. Some are funny, some are sad, but most of them get it wrong, because things that happen in those movies don't happen in real life. Well with 'About Time' you get something that feels real, and if that is not enough, you get one of the better movies about love that you will see all year, and it is about time for that.Brian Taylor http://the2cinemen.blogspot.com/",9,0,2,24 October 2013
Pacific Rim," Pacific Rim Christmas came early....
","How do you make the perfect summer movie? I'm not just talking about the best action movie, or the best summer comedy, just the perfect summer movie. Some would say lots of explosions, while others may say a good love story will always do the trick. Every year all the studios aim to release a movie that you will want to see, their idea of that great summer movie. Well I think Guillermo del Toro has figured it out, Robots Vs. Monsters.I know it can't be that simple, since we already had a Cowboys and Aliens that didn't live up to expectations, but for me 'Pacific Rim' really is. We have always looked to the stars for where we thought visitors might arrive on our planet one day. But, what if they come from deep within our oceans? That is the question 'Pacific Rim' poses. Creatures called 'Kaiju' have attacked the coastal cities in the Pacific. They start in San Francisco, and then attack cities like Manila, and Cabo. After conventional weapons have little effect, the world's governments decide the only way to fight monsters, is to build monsters of their own. The 'Jaeger Program' is born, where giant robots are built to fight for mankind. Each Jaeger is controlled by two pilots, who control each hemisphere in the Jaeger. The Jaegers become mankind's best weapon against the 'Kaiju' and their only way to save the planet. This is what 'Transformers' could have been, if del Toro had been at the helm instead of Michael Bay. While Bay has always been a visual director, he just does not have the complete package like del Toro. This movie has something for everyone, but above all it is just fun to watch. It is a big and loud, and one of those movies that are made to be seen on the biggest screen you can find. For everything that is wrong with summer movies like 'After Earth' and 'The Lone Ranger' this movie gets it right. This is not a movie that is going to get praised for its great story, even though it has a decent one. The main selling point is 'come see this movie and you get to see giant robots and monsters beat the crap out of each other.' I mean really after that what more do you need? I went in expecting to see one of the best movies of the summer and walked out not thinking any different. The performances for the most part are not anything special, except for every time Idris Elba is on the screen. Given the best dialogue, including a speech any football coach would love, Elba just commands your attention. In a world where sequels rule, we should embrace originally. I mean didn't we say all we needed to say with the original 'Grown Ups'? Do we really need another? I say this weekend when you go to the movies see 'Pacific Rim'. It's like sequels are the 'Kaiju' and this is your chance to command a Jaeger and to tell the world you are tired of all the 'Kaiju'. And if you can, see it 'IMAX' big, because this movie doesn't do anything small.Brian Taylor http://the2cinemen.blogspot.com/",Null,12,21,11 July 2013
Elysium," Not District 9, but still not bad
","Most of the great works of science fiction take place on a spaceship, another planet, or in the case of the new Neil Blomkamp film, a dystopian future where instead of a wall separating two countries, it's the space between a diseased-ridden Earth and the distant but visible Mercedes-Benz logo looking space station, 'Elysium'.On Elysium the haves, have it all, beautiful houses, beautiful children, and even little MRI machines that cure whatever ails you, be it broken arm or life-threatening disease. The have-nots back on Earth live a hard life not to dissimilar from the one that Blomkamp portrayed in his previous film, the fantastic 'District 9'. Instead of the oppressed aliens in Johannesburg, this time it's a whole planet. On this Earth, in the ruins of L.A. in the year 2154 lives Max (Matt Damon) an ex-con with the heart of gold, which we're told in way too many flashbacks that he is special. On Elysium Jodie Foster runs the show as a government official who keeps the floating paradise safe by killing all who try to enter.When all too convenient circumstances bring Damon and Foster in opposition the movie really picks up, with a few stops to introduce Alice Braga's character and fits her and her story like a familiar puzzle piece into the narrative. That is the major drawback on the film aside from the constant reminders of rich is bad and poor is good, is that everything feels all too convenient. Characters who all know each other or who only have one degree of separation between the main cast. Plus if you know sci-fi, or even movie logic, you will see everywhere the movie takes you well before you get there.The performances keep you engaged enough, mostly though through the slightly 'off' character Kruger played fittingly by Sharlto Copley. What really stood out to me was the world building and the incredible, I mean really incredible visuals. From the robot police to the simple 30- plus year effect of a ship flying in space, the visual effects artists really made a beautiful looking film. Writer/Director Blomkamp still needs some work on his storytelling and his fight scenes. Or maybe he shouldn't have got the steady-cam crew from Damon's 'Bourne' movies to shoot a lot of his action.The classics of sci-fi almost always have some sort of social commentary as told through a fictional prism. Who we are, what we are capable of, what we can do to ourselves as well as one another in a society with rules that are followed blindly. Unfortunately 'Elysium' is not one of those destined to be a classic, but it reminds you of the potential these types of films still have and gives me hope that Blomkamp can give us another one with his next film.--Robert L.

The Conjuring," Horror done right
","Everyone has a ghost story or at least knows someone who does. Some people use these stories as a game, something you do while you sit around a campfire or something. To others those stories are not to be retold, instead they are locked away and you hope you can forget. I have heard stories from people that I couldn't believe and would never want to experience them personally. The only things I have seen that terrified me have been on a movie screen, and I have seen enough of those to know the rules. You never go and investigate a noise in a cellar by yourself, also if things start moving by themselves just get out, and finally never buy a house or some land if you don't know it's history. Unfortunately for the Perron family they didn't follow any of those rules.'The Conjuring' is a story of a family in the 1970's who buys what they think is their dream home in Rhode Island. Not long after moving in, things start to happen that are unexplained. Things like the house being cold, doors opening and closing on their own, and seeing people that were not really there. After a few months of these things happening, the family seeks out Ed and Lorraine Warren, who are experts on such unexplained occurrences. What the Warren's find is the worst thing they have ever investigated. Let's face it; we all like to be scared. We want to find that horror movie that makes us fear the noises we hear at night when the lights are off. With so many stories out there, you would think that they could make a movie that did that. Well 'The Conjuring' is not there, but it is pretty close. Not since watching 'The Exorcist' as a child, have I experienced the chills that ran up my neck. This is not a 'jump out of your seat' scary movie, this is a tense and at times terrifying scary movie. Making you jump is easy, have someone appear out of nowhere, or a loud noise break dead silence. The trick for me though, is feeling like I should leave the closet light on because of the things I saw. Ed and Lorraine Warren's case files have been used as basis of a few films. Films like 'The Amityville Horror'. 'The Haunting in Connecticut', and 'The Haunting'. Just like in 'The Amityville Horror' in 1979, 'The Conjuring' brings a story that will make you believe in things that are unbelievable. I think the best review I can give this movie is after the credits rolled, I believed what I just saw really happened. Imagine that, a based on true horror story that I believed. This is a movie that will have some of you watching it through your fingers. It may not answer all questions or prove to you that some things really exist. What 'The Conjuring' will do that most movies like it don't, it will remind you of a time when horror was good and scary.Brian Taylorhttp://the2cinemen.blogspot.com/",Null,2,5,18 July 2013
Inside Llewyn Davis," The Coen's... enough said
","Sometimes when you are with your friends you will go into those 'what if' scenarios. You know things like what if you found a million dollars, or what if you only had one week to live? I always remember someone asking me what would be the one thing you would grab if your house was on fire. Well I want to change that question to this: if you could only choose one filmmaker to always make movies, which would you, choose? How do you decide, when there are so many great filmmakers? Well my choice would be the Coen Brothers. Now I know what you are thinking, I said one filmmaker, and my answer happen to be brothers, but my response to that would be, when they direct and write their films they are like one incredible creative force. I choose the Coen's because they march to their own drummer and tell stories that always seem special, and memorable. They don't make movies that exist in the normal world; instead they invite you into their world. Now in the Coen's world there tends to be a lot of anger, but with that anger you also get passion and the most unique kind of humor as well. In their new film 'Inside Llewyn Davis', they tell a story about a young folk singer trying to navigate Greenwich Village in 1961. That singer's name is Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac), and if you couldn't guess by the name the story is about him. Llewyn is trying to cope with being on his own after his musical partner jumped off the George Washington Bridge. Although extremely talented things just don't seem to go right for Llewyn, and it is mostly his fault. You see Llewyn does not have the best attitude and always relies on the generosity of others to survive. It could be crashing with his friend's girlfriend Jean (Carey Mulligan) or getting work with Jim (Justin Timberklake) to help pay his debts. No matter how bad his life can get though, Llewyn can always escape into his music.I know why I love a Coen Brother's movie; to me it is just like comfort food. As in comfort food, you know what you are getting; you will get great characters, a great story, and a little added 'Coeness' that makes their stories so special. While their movies have those central elements in common, their stories and themes are never the same. With 'Inside Llewyn Davis' everything is there and as with 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' we get a great soundtrack to boot. Oscar Isaac is brilliant as Llewyn Davis, who learned to play guitar for this role. In fact all of the musical scenes where actually recorded live during filming for an authentic sound. Everyone has a favorite Coen movie, because no two seem to ever be alike. The only thing they have in common is they are always seem to be one of the better movies of that year, and with 'Inside Llewyn Davis' that trend remains.Brian Taylor read this and other reviews @ http://the2cinemen.blogspot.com/",9,10,22,5 December 2013
