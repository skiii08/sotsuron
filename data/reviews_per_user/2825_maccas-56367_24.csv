War Dogs," Entertaining fun for fans of Wolf of Wall Street or Catch Me If You Can
","That laugh... Even better than Jonah Hill's teeth in 'The Wolf of Wall Street'.I really enjoyed this film. It was well-paced, had some laughs, good use of tension and action, with Hill and Teller having a good dynamic too.Pretty crazy that it was a true story - the US seems to have (or at least had) an insane system. Would be nice if one of these rags to riches story actually had a happy ending, but I guess that's life.Ana de Armas is in this movie too. Who? Yeah, I didn't know who she was prior to watching this, but now I want to book a ticket to Cuba, a destination not even in the movie. Stunningly attractive with excellent acting chops too.If you like 'The Wolf of Wall Street' or 'Catch Me If You Can' then you'll probably enjoy this. 'War Dogs' is an easy-to-watch film that kept me entertained throughout!",8,0,1,21 January 2019
Rocketman," Elton the Musical
","First of all, this is a musical in the truest sense of the word. Don't even begin to compare it to the likes of 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. It is more comparable to the likes of 'Mamma Mia' in style, but with the story centered around Elton's relationship with himself and his inner demons.I loved Taron Egerton in 'Eddie the Eagle', yet 'Rocketman' truly allows him to showcase his acting (and vocal) range. It's a seriously impressive performance. I can't wait to see what he does next!This is an energetic film, propelled along with the power of Elton's impressive catalogue of hit songs. I couldn't help but imagine the Broadway version of this. In some ways, it felt like it was solely written for Broadway, though the freedom of filmmaking allowed the fantasy scenes to be fully explored. Things get crazily surreal at times, but it works because it's Elton and it's a musical. If you go into an Elton John biopic thinking it will be 'straight' in any sense of the word, you're going to quickly have expectations dashed.I'm glad 'Rocketman' didn't shy away from the mental health issues and addictions of Elton. It makes for a much more authentic character study. The final 'therapy' scene and 'hug' left me rather emotional.Was this the best musical I've seen? No. Was it the best biopic? No. But it was enjoyable and makes me want to go crank some Elton John CDs, so I feel it succeeded.",8,1,2,22 September 2019
Wind River," Powerful
","I unexpectedly loved this. Easily Jeremy Renner's best performance. The landscape was as much a character as anyone else in the film too. The snow and isolation added a real sense of dread and atmosphere to the movie.Excellent pace and plot. Elizabeth Olsen definitely has some good acting chops also and shares great onscreen chemistry with Renner. Is it the happiest movie? No. It's pretty dark and has many confronting themes, even for a movie of its kind. But it was satisfying. The final act was jaw on the floor type stuff - I definitely let out an audible 'wow' during the last 20 minutes.And then to top it all off, it's inspired by actual events and highlighted the plight of the many missing Native American women whom no statistics are recorded for.Powerful. Emotional. The best film I've seen this year.. so far.",9,1,1,21 January 2019
Darkest Hour," If only the film was as good as Oldman's acting
","It's hard to believe the same guy was Sid Vicious in 1986, and Winston Churchill in 2017. 'Darkest Hour' really is the Gary Oldman showcase film. His performance is well deserving of the Best Actor Academy Award. I just wish the film had been as consistent and free-flowing as Oldman's acting.The more I learn about Churchill, the less I seem to like about him. This film is no exception. It definitely portrays Winston as quite an incapable Prime Minister at times - which further illustrated what I have been reading lately.The film felt a bit disjointed at times, though picked up toward the end. It was hard not to get a bit angry or frustrated towards the politicians being incapable of anything but infighting among themselves. It's definitely a 'yelling film', which grew tiresome. Lots of yelling. Which if not for Gary Oldman, I'd say gets all too often confused for 'strong dramatic acting'. Though a shout out should also go to Ben Mendelsohn's excellent support performance as King George VI.My heart definitely went out to the brave soldiers whose lives were in the front-lines, while these muffins sat puffing cigars at desks.Oldman delivered strong renditions of Churchill's famous speeches, though it was the London Underground scene which was by far the highlight of the film for me. Churchill's also not short of quotable lines either:'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.'",6,0,3,21 January 2019
The Irishman," Good morality epic without being a masterpiece
","Had been looking forward to this for years. Glad to see these phenomenal actors reunited with Scorsese in an epic film - the second longest I've ever seen (only behind Ben Hur).The length and CGI are often the two most talked about aspects of this. I thought the CGI de-aging worked well and didn't find it distracting. Only some of De Niro's movements when 'younger' didn't fit so well. The runtime, however, did feel too long. Not every scene was a classic, and I found my attention fading occasionally.The best part was simply seeing these actors working together and they all delivered convincing performances. Joe Pesci definitely still has it, while Al Pacino hits it out of the park, with what is the best performance in the whole film. The political, union aspects of Pacino's character (Hoffa) were often some of the more tedious, mundane though.This often didn't feel like a gangster film. It becomes a lot more than that towards the very end. It turned into a strong morality tale, about life and death, sins, living a good life etc. I found 'The Shootist' touch really powerful. The last 30 minutes were the strongest of the film. Other scene highlights were 'the fish car' and simply just seeing De Niro and Pacino share a hug at this stage of their careers.I have to admit though, I most enjoyed The Irishman when someone was being whacked. For a film about a hitman these instances seemed few and far between. For much of the film I felt quite emotionless. Neither loving it, or hating it, simply just feeling like a bystander to the story and events. This lack of emotions could perhaps be attributed to the emotionless disposition displayed by some of the main characters - most notably De Niro's Frank Sheeran.The final scene is the type of cinematic experience that gets you talking among friends in the days after. Overall, I found The Irishman good, without being the masterpiece many are claiming it to be. It would make a good film to watch on any long haul flight.Props to Netflix for getting behind such a project. I hope its not the last of its type they support!",7,1,4,14 December 2019
"I, Tonya"," Wolf of Wall Street meets Dumb and Dumber - On Ice
","One of those annoying movies that sucks you in with a captivating and somewhat strong start. It even had a couple of laughs. Then it just descends into boring, disjointed monotony that you don't really care for. But by then, you've wasted too much of your life on it - so you wrestle with abandoning or pushing through.At times felt like Wolf of Wall Street meets Dumb and Dumber On Ice. But ultimately, just felt like 2 hours of domestic violence.It has an absolute killer soundtrack and great use of music throughout. And sure, there are some strong performances, notably by Margot Robbie (doing us Aussies proud) and Allison Janney - but they didn't necessarily keep me engaged with the film. It all just felt overly long and drawn out.I knew nothing about Tonya Harding going into this, and don't think my life is any better for having watched this either. I'm going to stick with Cool Runnings and Eddie the Eagle until a Steven Bradbury biopic is made.",3,3,7,25 January 2019
Black Mass," A film about ratting and none much else
","Had been wanting to check this out for a while - more so since news headlines of Bulger's murder in October 2018.I didn't really know much about the guy or his crimes, and to be fair, I don't feel like I really know much more having just watched 'Black Mass'. It's literally just a film about people spilling secrets, 'ratting' on one another, with the occasional portrayal of brutal violence.Johnny Depp does his best, and is supported by an exceptionally strong cast of big-name actors. His makeup was slightly distracting though, as were the fake Boston accents at times.There are a few powerful, well-structured scenes scattered throughout, but they barely flow together, and there's often too much 'filler' in between. Can't help but think this would've been a lot better off in the directorial hands of Scorsese, instead of Scott Cooper.It feels like not a whole lot happens in this film, and it's sure to get lost among many other better-made entries within the crime genre. An okay watch, but ultimately just not memorable at all.",Null,0,1,20 January 2019
Taxi Driver," Incredible De Niro Performance and Foreboding Atmosphere
","I've loved listening to Rancid's Travis Bickle for the best part of 15 years, but it took me until now to watch Taxi Driver for the first time.It's certainly one of the most powerful films I've watched and will no doubt stay with me for some time. Being powerful doesn't necessarily equate to being enjoyable to watch though - at least in my experiences. I was never bored watching this, but damn - if I wasn't depressed before this, I certainly am now.Robert De Niro is the obvious standout here. His performance as Travis Bickle was mesmerizing and impossible to look away from. The character transformation throughout the film just added to the tension and impending sense of doom and dread.Think I'll be having that little jazz theme stuck in my head for a long time. I also enjoyed finally seeing the classic 'you lookin' at me?' scene. Young Jodie Foster was excellent too. It was interesting to see how so many films have borrowed heavily from Taxi Driver since.Do I think it should be talked about among the greatest films of all-time? No. But it was definitely worthwhile and the definition of gritty 1970s.",7,0,0,7 November 2019
The Lost City of Z," Classic adventure film
","When I was a kid, I dreamed of making films like this. I dived into any true adventure story and yearned to see big screen epics of these remarkable stories. So thank you James Gray for turning the incredible story of Perry Fawcett into film!This film really felt like they were trying to remain as faithful as possible to the Fawcett story while cramming as many events in. Sure it can move a little slowly at times, but ultimately I found it quite captivating and found myself drawn into this man's dogged pursuit of a dream.The lighting was a bit too dark at times (plenty of shadows, indistinguishable faces, lots of fire glows) - but I guess these kind of things are part of trekking thru a jungle. The jungle was definitely made to feel suffocating.Was great seeing Charlie Hunman in a role outside of 'Sons of Anarchy'. I also really enjoyed the 'old time' feel of it - the style of storytelling and orchestral music especially. It also reminded me of similar explorer 'epics' from my childhood that I loved - 'Shackleton' (2002) and 'The Lost World' (2001).Recommend to Indiana Jones fans that want to see the inspiration behind their hero!",8,0,0,25 January 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Entertaining, yet flawed biopic of the legendary Freddie
","My opinion on this film is about as mixed and conflicted as the critic and audience reviews out there.I both loved it and disliked it. I think Queen's input was a large part of the problem - they were a dull band who happened to create awesome music and had a phenomenal (and interesting) front man. This creates a problem in a movie where band members have so much input and need to divide screen time up.The music was a highlight, but I thought the 'origin' scenes of certain songs had been done so much better in other music films. It was just a bit the same same over and over. Rami Malek delivered a really captivating and charismatic performance. Oscar worthy? I'm not sure, but he seems like a nice guy, so I'm glad he won.It also felt kind of hypocritical at times - one second Freddie is delivering lines of not wanting to be a poster boy for AIDS etc, the next they're just lathering all the AIDS on real thick and steady. This film really tried to make Freddie out to be that poster boy for it, when it was only just a small part of the remarkable human being he was.I wasn't expecting a comedy with 'Bohemian Rhapsody', but it often felt incredibly serious (regularly taking itself too seriously) and devoid of many laughs. Despite this, it kept me glued and invested for its 2 hour run time which must be some testament to the film's entertainment value, right?The Live Aid performance was a fantastic finale and great way to wrap things up. It has made me want to delve into my Queen albums and read up more about who Freddie Mercury really was.",8,1,1,30 March 2019
Bird Box," I dislike unexpected visitors too, Douglas
","It seems John Malkovich's 'Douglas' and I share the same views in regards to unexpected visitors.Beyond that, 'Bird Box' is a film that never quite reached its full potential. I can't help but think it could've been in Oscars contention had it been executed better and with more efficient editing. As it is, 'Bird Box' is a bit too long and a bit too 'superficial' - with it often moving too fast for attachment to characters to develop.I'd seen it all before. 'The Happening', 'A Quiet Place' - hell, there was nothing really to separate it from other movies in the apocalypse genre. The theme of parenthood was strong and helped give it (what I considered) a good ending - but damn, it took a while to get there!Overwhelmingly bleak and depressing, with some disturbing scenes and aspects sure to shock some viewers - though I never felt truly 'scared'.What's with so many films these days being so woefully depressive? No wonder society is currently plagued with mental health issues of epidemic proportions. Give me some Paddington!",6,2,4,20 January 2019
Trouble with the Curve," Satisfying ending, but a little monotonous getting there
","This was really boring and mostly uneventful. The chemistry between Amy Adams and Clint Eastwood helped save it somewhat, while a particularly satisfying (yet cliche) ending redeemed things too.The Justin Timberlake part of the storyline was filled with a lot of cringe and just seemed rather irrelevant to the rest of things. The film explored a lot of a rocky father-daughter relationship - baseball just happened to be the backdrop to it all.There were a few too many characters to dislike. The main baseball character was hard to watch, and while things paid off towards the end, it took far too long getting there. This felt like a 3 hour film. Perhaps baseball fans who understand many of the references and names-dropped will enjoy it more.I'm glad Clint Eastwood has since starred in The Mule because this would've been a fairly pedestrian and bland way for him to go out. He plays the typical gruff, masculine Eastwood character here - with majority of the film's humour relying on it a bit too much.By all means, give it a go if you're a die hard Eastwood fan and into baseball. It has a heart which ultimately rises above some of the blandness, though it's not a film I'll watch again.",6,0,0,17 May 2020
Split," Intense and original
","(I watched this in 2018)I don't even know what to rate this. I just finished watching it and feel like it's the type of film that will stay with me for many days afterwards. That final scene had me yelling out loud in excitement!It is the most 'M. Night Shyamalan' film in years, so I can definitely see why people are describing this as a return to form. The complex spattering of themes throughout and bigger-life-picture vibe was certainly there too. Killer script and writing which is refreshing at a time when too many movies are becoming mundane or lazy.It also worked as good as any other thriller/horror out there. I wouldn't even know what genre to put this in - I don't think M. Night Shyamalan films belong in any concrete genre. I felt claustrophobic and uneasy watching this the whole time. In that sense, I didn't find it easy watching. But I couldn't look away.Much of the reason I couldn't look away was due to James McAvoy's career best performance. Seriously - how did this guy not get an Oscar nomination for this?! I've never really seen quite an acting display like it and he clearly loved performing the role(s). One second I would be laughing, the next I would be utterly terrified and getting sweaty palms.Features the best 'shrink' vs 'patient' scenes since The Sopranos.While I probably won't re-watch this, I'm still keen to say:Bring on 2019.",7,1,1,25 January 2019
Dunkirk," That Hans Zimmer score...
","DISCLAIMER: If you suffer from any form of anxiety, panic attacks or PTSD, then take caution when watching this film.I feel a bit shell-shocked after watching this, so if one of Nolan's aims was to ensure the audience felt like a shell-shocked soldier then he was successful.The Hans Zimmer score was so intense, so anxiety-inducing, that at times I found it incredibly distracting. It felt like probably the most developed 'character' in the whole film. Because character development was mostly thrown out the door in 'Dunkirk'. The opening scenes gave me more anxiety than the opening of Saving Private Ryan - and this was achieved without any gore.The film depicts events from three different perspectives. Personally, I wish the film had focused mainly on the everyday fishing boats off to rescue the lads - Mark Rylance's performance was the best and I felt really invested in his boat's story.I love Spitfires and the fighter aces of WWII. They're one of my favourite topics to read about and explore. I found the dog fight aerial scenes underwhelming in 'Dunkirk' though. I actually found them somewhat unrealistic, where I had actually anticipated them to be the most authentic depictions in film yet. If you want to see a better example of this; check out 'Battle of Britain'.Why go to so much effort in creating authenticity in a war film, only to just throw it away at times? Some scenes felt contrived. Events weren't always chronological which made it feel disjointed. Emphasis was put on 400,000 soldiers needing to be evacuated from the beaches of Dunkirk. Yet, here I was watching 3 blokes sitting around on the most deserted stretch of beach I've ever seen.In a film with limited dialogue, it actually managed to include 'filler' dialogue. The Kenneth Branagh scenes in particular came across as if Nolan was trying to educate an assumed dumb American audience on this part of the war.I felt more invested in the film right towards the end. Perhaps by then, I'd got accustomed to the jarring Hans Zimmer score, or maybe it was the three perspectives coming together that made the film feel more 'whole'. In a film that was my most anticipated of the year, I'm left feeling a little disappointed and underwhelmed - it was an alright movie but could've been so much more.",5,0,0,21 January 2019
The Conjuring 2," Terrifying. Vera Farmiga at her usual best.
","The recent passing of Lorraine Warren prompted me to finally watch this sequel to the The Conjuring. The first one gave me nightmares and I have a feeling this one will too. I'm more easily scared these days, but this still felt like one of the most terrifying films I have ever seen.The Conjuring 2 was horror film-making at its creepiest best. I felt like I couldn't really come up for air during its over 2 hour duration. The scares and creepy scenes just felt relentless (almost too much so). At one stage, my dog looked at me (with my hands over my eyes) as if to say, 'what the hell is wrong with you?'I'm a huge Vera Farmiga fan, and she is perfectly suited to the role of Lorraine. Patrick Wilson puts in a good performance too, and they share excellent onscreen chemistry. Whether or not you believe in ghosts or this particular case, it was still unbelievably terrifying - particular for me, who grew up in a haunted house.I'm not religious, but the religious element here was done well (without being preachy) and gave a bit of an Exorcist vibe to things. The film felt like a combination of Poltergeist, The Exorcist and The Amityville Horror.It was unexpectedly feel-good too! The ending made me smile and I certainly didn't think The Conjuring 2 would be the most uplifting film I'd seen in recent weeks. In saying that, it wasn't exactly a relaxing Friday night watch.RIP Ed and Lorraine - together again.",7,0,1,26 April 2019
Yesterday," I didn't buy this love story..
","Seriously, you basically see the entire movie within the first 20 minutes, because that cycle just seems to repeat itself throughout. So much could've been done with this awesome concept, and while it's entertaining enough, it didn't fulfill its potential.Danny Boyle, Richard Curtis, The Beatles, Lily James. So much I love, so I was looking forward to seeing this. Unfortunately, there were just so many annoying characters. Ed Sheeran's scenes always had an element of awkwardness about them, while it also didn't help Himish Patel lacked the charisma needed to pull off the lead. The fact he was playing a fraud for 3/4 of the film didn't do him any favours.While proudly wearing an element of the 'fantasy' tag, there were still too many scenes that weren't convincing or believable - that should have been. Can't say I was a fan of the modern music scene and industry being mixed with the Beatles in this way.It was sweet, but also a bit twee at times. The whole premise probably says more about the current state of the movie industry plagued with reboots and remakes than it does anything else. Despite its downfalls, it was a refreshing change from the usual superhero movies these days. The John Lennon scene was the best bit.An okay film with an excellent premise that should've had better results.",6,2,4,23 November 2019
A Quiet Place," Anxiety-ridden
","Refreshingly original. Tense. A tinnitus-sufferer's worst nightmare. Grim. Anxiety-ridden. Reminders of Shyamalan's 'Signs'. I'm glad a film like this came along at a time when cinema seems less and less original, filled with boring remakes or the same-old superheroes.Krasinski did really well here, as it's a fantastically crafted film. His use of silence (and sound in general) as one of the key elements of the film was incredible. The chemistry between he (and real-life wife) Emily Blunt was a joy to watch. Strong performances by the kid actors too.While it kept me gripped throughout, and succeeded in holding my interest, I just didn't find it all that enjoyable. I don't know whether it was the overwhelmingly grim atmosphere or anxiety at every turn. A big part of me wishes the 'creatures' had been less visible, more unseen. I feel like it would've been far more effective.Need to watch something a bit more light-hearted now. I'll never take blasting my stereo for granted again!",5,0,1,20 January 2019
Invincible," Inspiring underdog story
","I don't like NFL. Not sure I've even lasted the length of a full game. Invincible is about a whole lot more than a game though. It's about many things - a sport just happens to be played at times.Never giving up on your dreams. Triumph over adversity. It's a story about the underdog. Who doesn't love an underdog? It's also based on a true story. While there are probably embellishments and diversions from the truth, it works fantastically as a movie. I was needing a pick-me-up and Invincible certainly ticked that box.Mark Wahlberg seems perfectly suited to the role of Vince Papale. He's believable. Elizabeth Banks is also fantastic to watch (as usual). There are some cheesy scenes at times, but they don't detract from the story. It's hard not to become invested in Papale's journey. The NFL scenes seemed particularly authentic, instantly making the viewer feel like a player on the team.Invincible also features a rockin' 70s soundtrack which really helps capture the feel of the era. If you love sports movies, Wahlberg or underdog stories, then give Invincible a go - it's one of the good ones.",9,0,0,20 April 2020
Reservoir Dogs," Overrated
","It's official. I don't like Tarantino movies. 'Reservoir Dogs' is one of the most overrated movies I've seen in a long time. Even the awesome soundtrack couldn't salvage some level of enjoyment from me.Steve Buscemi was great as he usually is. But beyond that, there just wasn't much I liked here. I love some violence and swearing as much as the next person. But here, I can't help thinking Tarantino used it in such way as to draw attention away from the fact there isn't much below the surface of this film.People love over-indulgent, long guitar solos in songs - and Tarantino movies often feel like the film-making version of that. 'Reservoir Dogs' is no exception. This felt like some end-of-year final assessment in film school or drama class. I don't watch films for their technical aspects. My attention waned numerous times throughout overly long scenes and lengthy dialogue that had no purpose. '12 Angry Men' is an excellent example of how to do that in a way that is both artistic and entertaining. This is not.The use of flashbacks and change in timelines didn't do anything to keep me engaged either. The bare resemblance of a storyline just felt soulless and depressing, with it seemingly going nowhere. Unfortunately, far too often people consider yelling to be acting at its finest and most dramatic. The love for this movie and Tarantino movies in general will forever be the big mystery of cinema for me.",3,3,5,7 October 2019
The Disaster Artist," Entertaining - Franco at his best
","So, uh, this Tommy guy is a bit of a rare unit, eh!? I didn't think a movie about making a movie (a bad one at that) could ever be entertaining. I've even had a love-hate relationship with Franco's previous work. But there's no denying it, he gives out a great performance in this strange, but ultimately captivating film.It kept me gripped throughout anyway. At first, Tommy comes across as a guy who just doesn't care about anything and everything in life. It was refreshing. The diner scene in particular was practically inspiring! Inspiring is a word I didn't think could be associated with this film - but it is. Two guys pursuing a dream, no matter what the odds are stacked against them, no matter how crazy it is. And you'd have to say they succeeded!It made me laugh out loud numerous times too - and any film that does that deserves some credit. I did find the character of Tommy irritating during the 'making of The Room' though- treating others horribly. Having his head up his own ass basically. It detracted from my enjoyment of the film, treading into 'yell as much as possible in order to get an acting award' territory.I think it's best to go into this film blind like I did - enjoyable enough!",7,0,0,25 January 2019
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," British cinema at its best
","How I imagine 'Foyle's War' would be if it met 'Doc Martin', with the added charm of 'Paddington' and some classic British romance thrown in on top.This was the most beautiful film I've seen all year. Stunning scenery and amazing cinematography. This film had a warmth to it that is often missing from films these days - except maybe Paddington. It made my eyes happy to watch it.If you've got a penpal, enjoy an old handwritten letter, or fancy yourself as a bit of a writer, then you'll probably enjoy this film too.Sure, it's got one hell of a title, but they even make a joke about it during the film. Laughs and tears aplenty - it also features different flashbacks that are actually effective in telling the story (I'm usually not a fan of jumping around in time, but this is done well). Strong performance by Lily James in the lead, with an excellent supporting cast. The plot weaved around, slowly revealing layers and it kept my interest throughout - building into an enjoyably satisfying conclusion.Highly recommend if you're a fan of British cinema - especially if you enjoyed the likes of 'The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel', 'Paddington', and 'Their Finest'.",10,1,2,20 January 2019
The Green Mile," A quick, powerful 3 hours
","Probably one of the quickest 3 hours I've experienced. It went fast. The strong performances, superb dialogue and powerful scenes certainly keep you engaged.You can't help but get emotionally invested in some capacity. Hanks is great in his role. Rockwell delivers a crazy Rockwell-esque performance that makes your skin crawl. Michael Clarke Duncan practically steals the show in his role as John Coffey.I had only ever seen snippets of this film over the years. Glad I finally sat down to give it my full attention. I didn't expect it to be so spiritual. For as much as the film shows miracles and 'hope', there are as many depressive elements throughout. A lot of tough-to-watch moments.Grateful there are some satisfying karma pay-offs, which reminded me a bit of The Shawshank Redemption. I don't feel this is as strong overall as that film though. Still, it's definitely worth a watch for fans of Hanks, Stephen King and gritty prison dramas.",8,0,0,21 March 2020
Marriage Story," A wonderful acting showcase that is also boring and depressing
","Watching my parents marriage breakdown and divorce was enough. I didn't need to spend my Saturday night watching another one.If your idea of a good time is watching relationship breakdowns, then you'll probably love this.Technically, I could harp on about all the wonderful acting, the writing and the way the film is presented. But I'm not a critic. I'm just some dude that wants to be entertained and connect with a movie.This didn't do that for me. All it did was send me reaching for the Prozac and wondering what so many people loved about it. Sorry, but I need more than just strong acting for me to enjoy a film.",1,13,28,4 January 2020
The Breakfast Club," Don't understand the hype
","Despite having experienced enough high school detentions to last me a lifetime, The Breakfast Club was completely lost on me. Sorry in advance - I know this might be an unpopular opinion of a film regarded by many as a 'classic'.I couldn't relate to this film and found it overwhelmingly uneventful and monotonous.Perhaps it was a combination of things:<ul><li>The 1980s</li></ul><ul><li>American high school</li></ul><ul><li>The ability to bring a gun to school</li></ul><ul><li>The fact they had an unbelievable amount of freedom while on detention</li></ul>Despite being born in '89, none of those things were relatable to me. The characters were well developed, but the storyline? Not so much. I felt like nothing really happened. Occasionally a random music break would wake me up.These critiques are not even touching on the fact The Breakfast Club is riddled with sexual harrassment and homophobia throughout. This is not a film that has translated well into 2019.All I can say is thank god for John Hughes giving us Home Alone and Ferris Bueller to make up for this boring mess.",3,7,12,2 March 2019
