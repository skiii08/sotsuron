Scarface," Er... soundtrack...?
","I don't have much to comment about this film, but I'd like to say a word on the soundtrack. Be it nice or not, it's the most inappropriate music ever written for a film, in my opinion. It almost made feel its intrusive presence and, while I usually like to watch a movie in its entirety --- end titles included --- I really felt like cutting it at the last scene, because of the soundtrack. What have a I seen --- I thought --- a rock musical or what?I like considering the music as an integral part of a film, so I cannot consider this film worth more than 7 out of 10.Also, I hate watching dubbed movies, and although I saw Scarface in its original English, I couldn't help noting the absence of the original Spanish language!",7,1,2,26 August 2005
Match Point," Crimes and misdemeanours, part II
","What if I'd praise this film - which is about a traditional love triangle (a handsome man, a beautiful and passionate young woman, a sweet and care-taking less-young wife) - as original? Would anybody believe me? And what if I added that it explores the tormented doubts of a husband, facing a crisis fought by an affectionate wife giving him a 'choose a life'-Trainspotting-lifestyle on one side, and a lust affair, adding - again - a praise for its originality? Would anyone believe me? How many hundreds of films like this have already been written? Well, the first part of the film is all about this and, in fact, is NOT original at all. It is simply well filmed and directed and acted. And that's the strength of the story: the non-originality, the already-seen, which compel the spectator to wait for an equally non-original and obviously already seen twisted plot made up of divorces, break ups, etc etc. BUT the spectator is going to find something very different from the expected, and is thus trapped by an anguish which I'd never expect from a Woody Allen's film. He caught me by surprise.It's a film terrifically different from all his other works. A murder! Oh well, yes, there was 'Manhattan murder mystery', but it was clearly a funny comedy. And there was 'Crimes and misdemeanours', as tragic as it could be, which however threw a totally different ethical responsibility upon the author of the crime. Match Point is a film about luck, which wickedly determines whether or not a homicide shall be punished. A question of fraction of millimetres, in a wedding ring which hits a railing as well as a tennis ball hits the net.Technically, I had the impression that Woody took longer than usual in the 'introduction' of the film, for the presentation of the characters. In the same way and time, I had the impression that he needed to 'introduce' an unusually new character for him: London.As for the comic side, I'll cite Trainspotting again, because Woody chose its Ewen Bremner to give us one of the few tiny (and great) spots of comicity in Match Point.Enjoy the film - and good luck!",9,10,15,20 January 2006
The Aviator," look at the Oscars...
","The best summary for this film can be provided by the prizes it won: lots and lots (editing, cinematography, costumes, even acting), but not for the best picture. Really, looking at it I continuously had the impression of grandeur, greatness, and that the director, the actors, the crew had made a terrific work... but for what? To narrate the life of a movie producer, billionaire, hypochondriac aviator, whom we have no reason to like. Surely Di Caprio is a great guy, and mesmerising probably for many, and so we end up liking the figure of Howard Hughes; but I think that the emptiness of this character *is* Di Caprio's ability to make us like him.Perhaps this film is just like Hughes' life: a great effort, put down with enormous ability, to build nothing. So, 7 out of 10 for me.A little curiosity: it seems to me the second role for Di Caprio dealing with Pan Am, the first being 'Catch me if you can'.",7,0,0,11 September 2005
Being John Malkovich," Genius and inventiveness, but also a great waste of talent
","I think that Charlie Kaufman is going to be my favourite screenwriter. I came to 'Being JM' after 'Eternal sunshine of a spotless mind' and again found with pleasure craziness and inventiveness in great abundance.Being JM won the Saturn Award for the Best Fantasy Film from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films, whereas Eternal Sunshine was nominated by the same for the best Science Fiction Film. Very well, because this means there is coherence and a kind of signature from an author.Said that I loved the genius spread all around the film, I must also say that I'd have been happier if such a brilliant idea of the vessel had been used to develop something more than just a 'comedy':John Malkovich: You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.Maxine: You're right, my darling, it's so much more. It's playing with people!I mean: from these very lines we can appreciate how differently and dramatically the film could evolve. In a sense, although as I said I enjoyed the movie, I also had the impression of a big waste of talent. In Eternal Sunshine such a talent was used to develop a wonderful love story, and this is why I think that Kaufman has really grown a lot after Being JM.",7,0,1,20 March 2005
Batman Begins," No news, bad news
","No, we're not in the ballpark...I went to the cinema to see Batman for a break. Although the cinema I like most is that which makes you think, today I did NOT want to think.But... but! The fights were all close-ups. No full-body ones. Much better, for this, The Last Samurai; or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; and so on.The car races were - again - close-ups of tyres burning in front of you, of cars speeding so close that you can't even admire them. For this, I'm sure that Taxi is much better.The gadgets (the car, the little bombs, the other stuff) were not impressive. For this, I'm sure that any James Bond movie is better.The filling love story was superficial and not interesting. I'm sure you'll agree the one in Spiderman is better.The idea of the guru who teaches the disciple is not new. Go and get The Matrix of even Highlander for that.So...? Why this movie? 6 out of 10 for me.",5,1,3,27 June 2005
Pride & Prejudice," It's a caricature!
","I understand that not every single film is intended to be a breakthrough in the history of the cinema. and that some films just want to entertain; I also appreciate that 'Pride and Prejudice' is probably one of the latter. Nevertheless, if I have to judge a film, I'll judge it as a film, exactly, and not as a fun fair.And, as a film, I reckon it shouldn't have been done. The story had to remain on the paper, written, because (besides nice postcard-wise sceneries and catwalk-wise women) nothing wanted to be shown, to take off from the paper and land on the big screen.The film is not just intended to entertain (only): it also seems intended for people a little stupid, who need the things be emphasised in order to be understood. All the characters are caricatures: Mr Darcy was a 'do not dare to speak, do not laugh, look serious and dumb'; Elizabeth Bennet was witty and clever and not a single line was down to the earth; the nice mother didn't just wish her daughters be married, but DESPERATELY needed them so; and so on.And, yes, the film does achieve its (only) goal: making people weep... but only at the very end.This film reminded me of 'Little women' (which wan not spoilt by all this artificial comicality) and Keira Knightley reminded me of Winona Ryder and, no, I don't think they are at the same level, nor that Keira has Winona's talent.For me, 5 out of 10. The only nice thing at the screening was the company I was with. ;-) Luckily I can't say I'd been disappointed, because I already had a (bad) prejudice of the film before the screening and, of course, I'm too proud to admit I was wrong. ;-)Marco",5,9,19,28 September 2005
The Descent," Not just bad. Ugly.
","I don't personally know the authors of this movie, but they couldn't be my friends, not anymore, not from tonight on, since I've seen this horrifically bad horror. No friends, because I just feel they wanted to tease the spectator, take the mickey out of them.Simply not fair. Yes, of course he who goes see an horror film wishes to be scared; sure as hell he wants. But politely. Intelligently. You simply cannot ground all the horror in scenes with sudden screams and thunders, sudden visions, sudden whatever. I can as well come to you and shout in your ear and probably scare you, if you aren't thinking of me.And this film doesn't just (try to) scare in a stupid way; it's also stupid, too. In the plot, in the characters, in the occasions created to introduce the events. I can understand that some movies just need a very basic plot to introduce amazing and entertaining SFX scenes... but besides some little pale scary monsters, there really was nothing amazingly beautiful to see or follow.'It's beautiful', says one of the cave divers as soon as she reaches the bottom. Perhaps the scene was really beautiful (an hidden cave with a rich vegetation), but not even once the director chose to show us some of that beauty.Deprived of any beauty, this movie, very bad, is just and plain an ugly movie, which surely shocks you, but not more than a long series of loud bangs and explosions you could hear in your room.",3,36,63,5 August 2005
War of the Worlds," An eye candy visual show
","I usually don't like action-packed movies, SFX, gun fights, wars, explosions, 5.1, etc etc. So, I usually don't see them.Yet, my wait for this WoW was... spasmodic, I'd say. And it is curious (a coincidence?) that the last film I went see BECAUSE OF the special effects was Independence Day.I'd heard that the point of view in the film was that of Ray. But I was impressed the same NOT watching scenes that I could expect, such as a President of the United States' speech, or the plan for a military attack... All the military I could see was that passing in front of the terrified eyes of Ray's.I'd also read that our Ray is a sort of anti-hero. Bully, not kind... Yet, again, the perhaps biggest surprise for me came seeing that his son, not himself, started, on the ship, to help the passengers to come on board.I wanted to see this film for the special effects, I said, and for the special effects I'm glad I've seen it. The story is probably nothing special, and if you know the book, of course you also know the ending.But the special effects were amazingly BEAUTIFUL. The same kind of astonishing beauty, I'd say, that keeps you eyes wide open in front of a Gothic cathedral, or a sunset on the sea. The tripods were on the screen, and it was as they were in front of my very eyes: there, living, with their amazing technology and splendour.An eye candy visual show.",8,2,6,2 July 2005
Munich," Wow!
","I've just proudly seen Munich in a preview in Southampton. I must comment a little on it, and for once I'd like to avoid considering the story: when you start talking of terrorism, and Israel, and Palestine, well, you may never end it. So I won't start.But... the film! What a film. I'll be afraid, in the next few days, of watching any other film, especially my favourite ones, because they cannot help but seem minor in some extent. What a technique! I'd never seen before so great realism in the acting and in the direction. You may love such a realism, independently of the story which lies behind, so beautifully realised it is.I loved: 1 ) one of the first scenes, with the television showing the original live footage of a terrorist going out on the balcony of the hotel, shot from inside that same room; 2 ) the photography (each frame could be enlarged and watched as is); 3 ) the photography of the mother smiling and hugging her little daughter, against a beautiful bright light; 4 ) the final lovemaking scene, intermixed with the dreadful memories; 5 ) the tours over all the Europe of the 70s, perfectly recreated; 6 ) the very last scene with the Twin Towers, full of obvious meaning.Great.",9,0,1,23 January 2006
Donnie Darko," Never trust a 'cult movie' which is younger than you,,,
","One problem of this film is that the main character, Donnie Darko, is an anti-hero, someone not to be proud of - although I guess that his rebellious behaviour can somehow be appreciated by teenagers. It is a problem, because to make you interested in the stupid things he does, there should be something - a motivation. And when other more deprecable characters come into the picture (as the fear-love teacher), and you are supposed to side against her, it's not that easy, because in order to do that you should side with Donnie Darko.Another problem is that the film - and I don't know why - has become a 'cult'. OK, time travel is a fascinating thing, but this is definitely not the first movie about that (and, I'd say, not the best). And because it is a cult, your expectations are high - higher than due, and so the absolute normality and averageness of this film pops out evidently.And maybe the biggest problem is that part of the (little) beauty of the film is outside of it, actually: in the discussions, interpretations, 'parallel worlds' that live within the fans.It is good of course if a film sparkles ideas and discussions, but first of all it should be good itself. And I'm afraid I've seen too many stupid and boring scenes, that yes, they can look less silly 'a posteriori', but a film must be a pleasure to enjoy 'real time' too.The 15 BBFC classification reads 'Contains...psychological horror'. Horror??? Psychological??? Hey, when I see a horror movie I get scared (yes, indeed), not bored. All I see here is laughable. And, among the other things out of place, the politics deserve a special mention: it went too far if its purpose was just to frame temporally the film (and what for?).When the end came, well, I was still begging the film not to end, but to start! The final was interesting, and the ending scene of great beauty (thumb up for the song 'Mad world'), but in my opinion that was the only good part of all the movie. A whole movie should not rely uniquely on one scene.Probably, if this had been a short film, fifteen minutes say, it would have been a great short film.By the way, I saw the director's cut.",6,0,1,13 March 2005
