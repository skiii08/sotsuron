Minority Report," A 3rd SF classic?
","I've only seen it three times, so it's a little early to tell, but it seems that (maybe) Hollywood has finally popped out a third great SF movie! I think that MR belongs just might deserved to be mentioned in the same sentence as 2001 and Contact. Tom Cruise plays a non-smarta** for once and shows he can really act. The cinematography is muddled and strange, just like it needs to be. The bizarre storyline is paradoxically believable. Plot twists will blow you away. Is it great? I'll let you know in a few years.",9,0,0,29 November 2003
Rocky V," Not Bad, but Not as Good as VIII
","Rocky V was okay. However, Rocky XVIII was definitely superior. Sly in his walker whupping bedfast Apollo was a classic Hollywood confrontation along the lines of Grumpiest Old Men.Can't wait till we break into the XX series. Speaking of that, how about Super Bowl XXIV? Wasn't that a great one?Tongue-in-cheekingly yours--bbbaldie",Null,0,0,26 July 2001
Bridge of Spies," Plain and Simple
","I haven't experienced a film like this on first viewing since Raiders of the Lost Ark, a long time ago. This is a riveting tale of intrigue, the striving for justice, and the real fear that the world felt about nuclear war in the 50's and early 60's. I can't stop thinking about it. So many twists and turns! This movie is to spy films what Raiders was to adventure flicks: a changing, defining moment which will force all who follow to shape their own films to match.I'm done, but this site's silly demand for more lines of text means that I have to add this useless addendum. Too bad speaking succinctly is vanishing. The more one talks, the better what they have to say is, I guess.",10,3,8,18 October 2015
2001: A Space Odyssey," A Great Book Captured
","Behold that rarest of phenomena: a great book captured as a great movie.Arthur C. Clarke's magnum opus was nailed nearly perfectly by Kubrick. The plotline was followed faithfully. The classical music was a brilliant touch, making this not a 1968 movie, but a truly timeless one. The only thing that made it come up a bit short in this regard was the polyester clothing and the plastic furniture, but hey, YOU try to make a timeless film!BRAVO to the accurate depiction of the absence of sound in space. This realistic touch made us aware of every precious breath taken in space's vacuum (the only sounds that can be heard from the environment of a spacesuit). Why does every other SF movie make spaceships go by with a token 'whoosh!'?Kubrick made us appreciate the story line with the vivid imagery of the subhumans' warfare. In this regard, he actually outdid Mr. Clarke. Who can forget that thrown bone turning into a spaceship? Kubrick must have been a fan of the Beatles' 1967's Sgt. Pepper album, the scene reminding me of the chicken's cluck that turned into a guitar riff.This movie isn't for everyone, any more than any movie is. But for the diehard fan of science fiction writing, this is one of two musts (1997's Contact being the other). I hope some filmmaker someday captures Robert Heinlein's genius in the same fashion.",10,0,1,2 September 2001
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Aw, come on
","The movie ended darkly, with nurse Ratched firmly back in charge. Kesey's book showed that Randall's standing up to the evil woman was contagious, with the surviving loonies telling her to shove off. Why change the whole point of the story? 5 stars for great acting.",5,8,17,8 September 2003
Contact," It's Science Fiction, not Star Wars . . .
","Talk about miserable batting averages. Hollywood is way below the Mendoza line when it comes to SF films that compare well to the books that they are 'based' on. Classic books like The Puppet Masters, Fahrenheit 451, Starship Troopers, 2010, and Dune all swung and missed. It's just stinking hard to capture a great book on film.Well, Contact pulled it off. This movie defines SF of the 90's like The Godfather was the penultimate 70's drama. The effects, the story line, the lack of cinematic 'extras' that detract from the book, they all add up to a great presentation.A great movie, like a great book, makes you walk away thinking 'that could really happen!' Contact is such a film.You hardcore SF readers that haven't been to a movie adaptation of a book since De Laurentis gave Baron Harkonnen the disgusting skin condition way back in 1984: read Contact (like you haven't already) and then enjoy the film. You'll be glad you did.",10,0,2,13 October 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," I get it, SnobbyDude
","Don't the rest of you? The man obviously LOVED the movie. Hey, so did I. you either love or hate this movie, and even if it moved you, you just can't help poking fun at it! More great lines than Forrest Gump (another love-it-or-hate-it film), music that makes bluegrass fans out of old time rock-and-rollers, and a plot that goes back a few thousand years. The digital manipulation was astonishing. My favorite thing about this movie? It's truly a film for all ages. Kiddies old enough to handle the PG language through old geezers who were around in the depression will all find something to love. Thanks, Coens.
