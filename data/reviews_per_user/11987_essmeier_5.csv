Vertigo," One of the Master's weaker efforts
","'Vertigo' is often hailed as a masterpiece, but it's difficult to see why. The film runs 128 minutes, but feels like 240 while it pursues ultimately unimportant mysteries involving long-dead non-characters.  The logic-defying plot, as many have pointed out, is convoluted to the point that it makes almost no sense, and the abrupt ending comes out of nowhere.  The ending is so bizarre that I couldn't help but burst out laughing the first time I saw it.  Stewart's performance is OK, but his character borders on the psychotic, and one can't help but wonder why Novak didn't just tell him to get lost.  Barbara Bel Geddes turns in a nice performance, and then abruptly disappears for the last half of the film.  Herrmann's score is noteworthy, but not as memorable as those of 'Psycho' and 'North By Northwest.'  I've seen 35 of Hitchcock's films; this one ranks near the bottom, right alongside 'Rich and Strange' and 'The Man Who Knew Too Much' (1934.)  Pass on this one; try 'Frenzy' instead.  Two stars.",3,4,9,13 September 2000
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Yawn
","If you've seen one Tim Burton movie, you've seen them all. The film is dark and murky, with the mandatory casting of Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter and a few camera tricks and odd shots thrown in to show you he's in charge.If you've heard one song by Stephen Sondheim, you've heard them all.Add blood and guts, and you've got a dull, slow-moving musical with muddy imagery and really bad songs.The film is just sort of 'there'; it doesn't really inspire much emotionally either way. The cast sings fairly well, despite the fact that the songs, like most of Sondheim's material, are simply terrible.On the plus side, there are no songs in the film that are as bad as 'Officer Krupke' from West Side Story, which remains the Worst Song Ever Written.Pretty much a waste of time.",4,4,12,28 December 2007
Moulin Rouge!," Two trains full of confetti, colliding head on
","What a mess!  Director Baz Luhrmann takes every known cinematic gimmick, tosses them all into a food processor, and splatters the mixture all over the screen like a would-be Jackson Pollock.  It's loud, brash, colorful, relentless, and doesn't make a lick of sense.  The result is a musical that seems to take place at no particular time, and in no (despite the name) particular place.  There's nothing here that even remotely evokes either Paris or credibility, and character development is nonexistent.  Ewan McGregor meets Nicole Kidman, mutters a few Bernie Taupin lyrics to her, and she immediately declares that she's 'in love.'  Uh, right.  The next 100 minutes consists of various characters engaging in routine and stereotypical melodrama, singing bits and pieces of twentieth century pop songs to one another with songs rarely being sung in their entirety.     The 'Like a Virgin' sequence rivals the 'Officer Krupke' sequence from 'West Side Story' as perhaps the worst three minutes ever presented in a musical film.     The conclusion of the story is totally unmoving, since you don't know the main characters well enough to care about them.  When it's over, you just sit there wondering why you paid good money to be visually and aurally assaulted for 126 minutes.     On the plus side, Luhrmann's use of color is impressive.  Kidman looks absolutely radiant, and she and McGregor both sing surprisingly well.  The opening credits are quite clever.     I'd have been tempted to give this film a rating of zero, but the film is so emotionally uninvolving that I just didn't care about it or any of its characters enough to hate it that much.  2/10.",2,25,46,18 June 2001
The Big Blue," The Big Bore...
","After an eternity of trying to find the director's cut on laserdisc, I finally got to see it...and I understand why the original release was an hour shorter.  There are two films here - a love story, and a competition among friends. Unfortunately, neither story is fully developed, and the final result is a mess that just begs for editing.  He loves her?  Probably not.  It doesn't really matter, because she just wants a baby.  Why? Because another character with about three minutes of screen time told her she did. From that point on, it's her obsession.  A diving competition? Not really, because Jacques doesn't seem to care.  Eric Serra's score is nice, and Reno's performance is solid.  The photography is nice, but if you want nice photography, you can always check out Koyaanisqatsi instead, where you won't have to deal with ambiguous/non-existent narrative.  All in all, it's a film full of loose ends that never quite come together.Two stars out of four, even in the director's cut.",Null,0,5,16 July 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Pretty to look at, but otherwise empty
","This film, like its two predecessors, is pretty to look at but emotionally sterile and ultimately a colossal bore.  The fault isn't with director Peter Jackson; the problem lies with Tolkien's weak, silly, and juvenile material. The characters are poorly developed; you don't know who they are and therefore can't relate to them or the incomprehensible story.  It doesn't help that their names all sound the same, and that once you've seen one male character with long hair, a beard, and a name that seems to consist only of vowels, you've seen them all.  The characters, places, and battles all have a sameness to them that just leaves the viewer numb.  After a while, I lost track of who was fighting whom, or where, or over what.The character of Gollum surpasses even Jar Jar Binks as cinema's all-time obnoxious character.Ultimately, it's big, loud, expensive fluff, masquerading as masterpiece. Two stars, assuming that you can manage to stay awake for the entire film, which is something I wasn't able to do during the first two installments of the trilogy.",5,1,4,31 December 2003
