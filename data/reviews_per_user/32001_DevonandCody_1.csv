The Ring," Watch Out, Evil About
","I found most of this movie okay, not at all scary though it is a little jumpy. Watch out at the end though. WARNING: Make sure you are not alone to watch the movie from the point where Rachel is down the well. And be sure to have the remote in your hand and your finger on the stop button when Aidan's father is alone in his apartment and the TV turns itself on. You'll see why.I was so scared when I saw Samara's face as the DVD froze and was stuck on her face. I made the mistake of watching it alone. I have no idea what happened to Aidan's father or in the rest of the movie. There's no way I'm watching the sequel.",1,0,2,29 June 2005
