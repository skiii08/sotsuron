Raiders of the Lost Ark," Captures the imagination
","Watching this movie as a child filled me with awe and wonder. I was taken to another place and time filled with mystery, adventure and danger. I'd never seen anything like it. The most thrilling part of the movie was how the scenes unfolded. A scene would start with slow tension; Harrison Ford making his way down a trail. The pace would pick up as he encountered a surprise. The scene would return to calm tension. Suddenly, with no warning, chaos! Ford running for his life. It was a roller-coaster of emotion and adrenaline. Although this movie is much older now, as am I, it will always hold a special place in my heart.",Null,0,0,7 February 2017
Spirited Away," I was transported!
","Spirited Away captures the experience of small town amusement parks and the mystery of the bath house. The characters and scenes felt real. The beauty of the sky, water and countryside was immersive. The unexpected brought laughter as well as deep curiosity. Each part of the story unfolded drawing the viewer deeper and deeper into what might happen next. Spirited Away should not be missed!",Null,0,0,30 May 2017
