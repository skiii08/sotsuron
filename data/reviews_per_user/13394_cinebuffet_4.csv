3:10 to Yuma," Last Train To Dullsville
","** THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS ** This film had me until the end and then it completely fell apart. Good acting, good photography, great settings... but from the time they arrive in Yuma until the end the film falls into the realm of the incredible. I can take a leap of faith along with the best of them, but this requires that you wear blinders.Here is Ben Wade trying to escape the entire film, telling everyone that they are going to die at the hands of his gang unless they let him go. He fights, he kills he offers money... and then what does he do. He cooperates with Bale completely. It's almost as Bale was protecting him at the end in a game of 'capture the flag'. There are several scenes in the hotel room when Crow is alone with Bale and Bale turns his back on him. Not to hard to hit him and roll out the window.Then the running through the streets and Crow telling Bale 'look out' when a man tries to kill him? C'mon. But the most incredulous scene of all is after Bale gets shot and Crow guns down his whole crew, then surrenders his guns and peacefully hops on the prison train. Yes, I know he whistled for his horse which leads us to believe he is going to escape, but c'mon... the guy is suppose to be this ruthless killer and we're suppose to believe that after a few days on the trail with Bale he sees the errors of his ways and does this 180.Could have been good, but the ending required a little more thought. IMO.",5,0,2,3 February 2008
Memento," Very original
","This movie was great.  The acting the direction and especially the story. From the moment it starts you are hooked... trying to put the pieces together, but the film manages to always stay one step ahead of the viewer. A very taught and well-craft thriller. A must see !!!",10,0,2,26 April 2003
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Very cute
","Okay this is not some deep, thought provoking movie that is going to move the depths of your soul and make you reexamine your life.  It's entertainment and that is does very well.  It is a very well crafted romantic comedy with some very good laughs. (8/10)",Null,0,0,23 December 2003
Million Dollar Baby," Great Movie
","I could write a review of this movie and point to all the reason why I liked it... but I would rather talk about something else. We all have different views on things. Film is art and art is subjective. I find more and more on the IMDb people make their posts as if their view the absolute truth. many arm chair film critics and wannabe film bluffs add their two cents with righteousness than is offensive. Reading the various posts about this movie only makes my point. One person 'FreddyShoop' says, 'It is not the best film of the year, but probably in the top ten.' He then proceeds to vote it as a one. Now he is certainly entitled to his opinion, but their are so many contradictions in the voting that I no longer have any faith in the voting totals. Personally I cannot see how anyone could vote this movie a one. The acting is good. The look of the film in brilliant. Not your cup of tea? Okay... but a one. No better than Police Academy 5 or Battlefield Earth? I'm not talking total votes... I'm just pointing out that people gave those films a one... In fact if you go to the highest rated film on the entire IMDb, 'The Godafather' you will see that 119,493 people voted for it (as of this writing) and that out of those 7,229 people gave it a one! Incredible! Now I am not saying the people who gave it a one are not entitled to their opinion (even though I cannot understand how anyone could ever reach that conclusion) what I am saying is that I find the voting system to be misused. People seem to either vote in 10's and 1's. More thought should be given to make the votes more reliable.",Null,4,5,26 March 2005
