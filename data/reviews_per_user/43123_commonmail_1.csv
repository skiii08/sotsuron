3:10 to Yuma," Does anybody care about the plot?
","Well, everybody here seems to almost worship this movie and sing how great it is. I agree - acting is excellent, Russell Crowe and Christian Bale are perfect. Everything goes nicely and smoothly up until the end where you expect some kind of 'grande finale', when everything unwinds and makes the hidden intentions clear.But what you actually get? The villain shoots his own band (that came to rescue him faithfully) to help his captors to get him on a prison train so the son of one of the captors can look up to his father. How impossible is that? I just could not stomach it. For that alone I give at best 6/10 and not a point more.",6,2,4,6 February 2008
