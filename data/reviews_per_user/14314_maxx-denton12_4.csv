Requiem for a Dream," Twisted, Great
","You don't need to take acid and listen to Pink Floyd while watching this movie to feel extremely trippy. Allow me to be frank, this movie is one of the most f*cked up movie I have seen; and it it awesome. It comes up there with A Clockwork Orange and similar titles. David Arronofsky is a genius (and probably a little insane, like most geniuses). His use of quick cuts, upper shots, split screen, and time motion are absolutely awesome. That's what attracted me to this movie in the first place, stumbling upon it on the IFC, I realized that it looked like a masterpiece and so I did what any film critic would: I turned it off. I knew I could not watch it from the middle and love as much. So I went out and rented it and watched it from the very beginning to the very end and it was absolutely amazing. The repetitive violin music is chilling and stays with you for days. The plot is somewhat loose, still great, and the way the three stories are intertwined is amazing. It's pretty much the story of four different people and how they go through four different and personal hells and end up f*cked over in the end. Amazing piece on society, drugs, and something that will stick with me until death.",10,1,2,9 August 2004
Resident Evil," Game vs. Movie
","Now, all my friends that have seen this movie p*** and moan about how it's not enough like the game or if they just would have made a movie exactly like the game it would have been great. Mind you, I never played the game (well, I played a little at a friends house) and I thought this movie was pretty damn cool. If you don't take it at face/game value it's got a good plot, with twists and scares and whatnot, some pretty decent actors, some awesome CGI effects (and just a bit o' nudity!). It's very chilling, especially the awesome ending, and I can't wait for the sequel to come out. Milla Jovovich fighting off zombies with guns in a red dress! What more could you ask for?!",Null,0,1,18 August 2004
Pulp Fiction," Definition of Cool
","If you go over to your dictionary and look up the word cool, you'll likely find Pulp Fiction the definition for it along with a picture of Quentin Tarantino next to it. When the credits hit the screen at the end of this movie a certain feeling rises in my throat. Unlike some other of my favorite movies, where I look at the world around me differently for a few hours, at the end of Pulp Fiction I'm simply struck by a feeling of 'Whoa, that was cool.' This movie could be called genius and I would agree. Quentin Tarantino is my favorite director and this was the first movie of his I saw and I have to admit that almost at first when I was watching it I felt that sort of ADD that I feel if I'm watching an okay movie. I was squirming around until the first shot was fired and then I sat for the next hour or so and was stunned. If you have not seen this movie, you MUST go out right now to your local video store and rent Pulp Fiction. It will change you, and you may find that you have a new favorite movie.",10,1,2,9 August 2004
The Matrix," Perfect on it's own
","When I saw this movie back in 2000, it was my favorite movie for about three years. I don't know what it is about it, the story, the way the story is told that makes you have to watch it 12 times to get it, the cool fight scenes (LOBBY SCENE!!), or all of the above. At the end you get feelings of coolness and hope, unlike some movies that have a depressive quality at the end (which I strangely also love). If you haven't seen this movie, go see it now! If you have, but you haven't watched the sequels, don't watch the sequels. Unless you really really really want to and have to. Because I'll agree that in Reloaded, the highway scene is way cool, and in Revolutions, the final battle is also way cool. But are they worth being let down? I'm not sure. See the first one, it stands on it's own as a strong, metaphor-filled, re-watchable over and over, absolutely awesome film. You will like it.",Null,0,1,18 August 2004
