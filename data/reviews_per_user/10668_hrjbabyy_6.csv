Casablanca," Casablanca
","This movie was easy to get lost into. Everything was going fast and I agree that I would have to watch it a second or third time to really see it all. I found the captain extremely funny, all of his puns amused me throughout the film. I always wondered where some lines in this movie came from and when I was little I always heard about this movie but I never watched it until now. The cinematography was really pretty, almost like everyone was glowing, and the way with the lights was really cool - the spot lights and all. I especially enjoyed the piano man, he kept the main character in check the whole movie and he seemed to be my favorite character of all.",Null,2,3,29 February 2012

","Overall, I disliked the movie because of the story line. I felt like it was just dragging on and on, I could not bring myself to get into the characters at all. Some parts were amusing but for the most part I just wanted to turn it off. One part that was cool, though, was that since it revolved around the newspaper the newspaper clippings were cool to show as the plot thickened. The whole rosebud plot was interesting as well and the way it ended made me say 'ooooohhhh I see.' and that does not usually happen often. I would not watch it again unless I had to, but never the less always a good experience to figure out what movies I do and do not like.",Null,0,1,10 April 2012
Taxi Driver," Taxi Driver
","This thriller was very cool and intense. Watching it made me want to go to New York City and see all the sites. In every movie there is a romantic underlying story and this one was definitely compelling. The action within the movie and the use of violence throughout was very intense and sometimes hard to watch because you knew something bad was going to happen. The way that he tries to assassinate someone was really intense and thrilling. The cinematography was intense and well done. The music was really what made the movie to me because it ques when to be nervous and when everything was fine and we were just going through the story and the plot. Overall, I really liked it.",Null,0,0,9 May 2012
Annie Hall," Annie Hall
","I have come to find that with watching this movie, Woody Allen did not grow on me. Maybe it was the fact that I could not really follow the flashbacks or maybe it was because I was not a huge fan of the drugs incorporated within the movie. I overall think that I did not hate it but I did not exactly love it either. The way that Woody Allen would come out of character and talk to the camera was amusing at times but what I really found amazing was the part where Annie has an 'out of body' experience so to speak and is sitting in the chair when in reality she is in the bed and the main character wants to simply have sex without the use of drugs before hand. I found that the most interesting of all the scenes, not because of the content of what was going on but how it was filmed. I just could not get over that the whole rest of the film and as it was going on I was thinking 'Now what is he going to do next?'. Overall, it was an okay movie but I would not recommend it to a friend or Netflix it to see it again, although I am open to all movies. If I have not seen it, I will not judge it until I do.",Null,0,0,25 April 2012
Singin' in the Rain," Singing In The Rain
","I have loved some musicals in my childhood - Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and Mary Poppins, to say a view, and I came into watching this musical with an open mind. While watching it, it was alright but overall I did not really care for it. I cannot really place my finger on it, maybe I was not really all that interested in the dancing but something set me off to it. I really enjoyed Donald O'Connors role and I enjoyed his performance. It made me look him up and want to watch more movies with him in it, and to me? If a movie can provoke a person to watch something new and find some type of joy in it, than it did its job. Overall, I will stick to my childhood musicals and Disney music movies although I am willing to always be open minded to new movies.",Null,0,2,29 March 2012
Psycho," Psycho
","The whole movie it was intense, from the music to the actual camera work. I never understood why she left in the first place but that was a minor detail. In my class we saw a documentary on Hitchcock and a couple scenes were in the documentary, so I knew the son was crazy but I never could have imagined that he killed his mother and had split personality disorder. The opening scene was really intimate and interesting because it showed a versatile side of the main character. Some of the camera work was over the top but it is meant to be that way. I found that the more complex the story got, the more I felt bad for the bad guy in the movie, even though you are not supposed to.",Null,1,1,7 April 2012
