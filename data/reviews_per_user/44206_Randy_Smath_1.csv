It," Missed opportunity
","This film has a special spot in my heart.
I was looking forward to this, ever since Cary was attached. Then he left.
And the movie was given to someone else.
I've never had problems with this, because it happens all the time in Hollywood.But i personally feel like, this movie was to good for Andrés.The movie feels lost. The tone is all over the place.
The script has all of these special moments. Then they are destroyed by the presentation.I'm not saying that the script is flawless. It has a lot of flaws, most of them are in the third act (i'm not a big fan of the ending).Bill is doing his best, but he's not allowed to be creepy, because jumpscares and CGI is surrounding him.It feels like the movie, has low self esteem. It needs to believe in it self. Because there is a good movie in here, somewhere.My advice for Andrés: Don't show to much, and let the audience get creeped out, because having too many jumpscares just screams desperate.",6,0,2,8 November 2018
