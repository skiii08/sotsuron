The Lobster," We are currently living in similar dystopia
","I just watched this movie today, after watching 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer' by the same director, Yorgos Lanthimos, and also featuring Colin Farrell.Lanthimos makes movies in the same genre as Stanley Kubrick (most notably 'The Shining' and 'Clockwork Orange.').In movies that touch topics like dystopia and humanity and its vices, this one is one of those that I usually sit and think about by a window with a nice hot cup of coffee.Throughout human history, we as species, are smart enough to think up rules of how we live among one another, but sometimes are very dumb as to think of the logic of why those rules exist. Most rules are made up by usually of one man or one group who happen to think it, and for the rest of history, it stays as a rule. Examples include, why do Hindus not eat cow (beef)? Why did the Salem Witch Hunt occur; how about the Spanish Inquisition? How did Joseph McCarthy come into power? Why can't a family unit consist of two women or two men raising a child? What are the consequences of one-child policy of China today? Or how about the idea that humans need to carry on their family name while wishing for a son. All of them because one man or group of men, thought it might make sense (at that time.) But I repeat myself.Those are the crazy questions that come about in real world, as the fictional world of the Lobster is just as crazy. I assume your parents have always asked you, when are you gonna get married and bring me a grandchild. Everyone probably has a crazy uncle or traveling aunt who never married. Remember the term, spinsters, alluding to a stereotype of an older woman who is unmarried, childless, prissy, and repressed. Those are the exact goals of the dystopia world of David, where you need to be a coupled or otherwise you are useless to this world, and we rather have you be useful as an animal.But besides thinking of crazy rules for 7 billions human beings to follow, the movie also brings out the dysfunctionality of rules that are to be followed by what we today call the Government, or the state. Crazy ideas at one time about slavery, sitting in back of buses, not sharing drinking fountains, no free speech for certain people, but just as much free hate speech for others, diversity and tolerance only for those who agree with you, etc.The movie shows that on either side (the left or the right) there is dysfunction. The two groups, the hotel runs it like a prison, where masturbation gets your hands burned; and when you get away free, the Loners has its own set of ridiculous rules to follow, like no flirting. At the mall, there's the set of rules where you need to have your papers (like drivers licence or passport) with you at all times. Humans are ridiculous, in deed and indeed.We are currently living in a dystopian world right now, where Trump is capitalizing on people's craziness for bias, double standard, false news reported as truth, and resistance. Just as dystopia was when certain group thought Jews deserve to be burned in ovens. We are living in a dystopia and not even know it. That's what the Lobster is trying to say.",9,0,3,30 April 2018
