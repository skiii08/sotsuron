Iron Man 3," why no rings of power
","Why even name the villain Mandarin if you don't even mention or show the 10 rings of power.They even had trivia before then movie when i went to see the movie and that was one of the questions. The mandarin was a magical type villain got his powers, from his 10 rings of power. Not some common terrorist with a AK47.Why cant marvel get anything right. They say they study the history of characters and then they make a movie and totally forget the history. Then claim they cant show everything because of just don't translate in real character movies.If thats the case then ANIMATE THEM.Still waiting to see a good ANIMATED version of THE INFINITY GAUNTLET",4,1,2,5 May 2013
Thor: Ragnarok," waste of money
","A completely waste of my time and money wait for the BLU-RAY. I really wish I could get my money back,not a single serious scene in the whole movie. A complete rewrite and let down for any one that knows the 20 year old story. I swear why don't Marvel just make up new names for the characters if there just gonna completely change the history.Still the only way to truly show a comic book movies is ANIMATE it. Been saying that for 20 some years now. The closest any MARVEL movie has gotten right and stuck to the true history is BLADE the first one.Still waiting for a INFINITY GAUNTLET animated version.",4,10,21,3 November 2017
Justice League," A serious move told seriously
",A serious movie told seriously. Great job on the acting and the story. The comedic elements actually fit in the story not the comedy making the story unlike the buffoonery in the Thor Ragnokrap movie. Im not even a big DC fan but this was hands down a better movie than Thor. box office numbers don't mean squat to me other than you can sucker people in to seeing something but don't mean they liked it. Cause I really wish I could get my money back from Thor.,8,2,6,16 November 2017
