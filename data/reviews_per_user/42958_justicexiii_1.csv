National Treasure: Book of Secrets," National Treasure Page 47 possible spoiler
","How About The City Of Atlantis For The Information On Page 47 At The End Of National Treasure 2 Book Of Secrets??? Maybe The Fountain Of Youth But I Think The Harvey Keitel Reference Joke To Gates Having Found The City of Atlantis When His Agents Came To Inform Him Of The Gates Family Being In The News Again, That Mention Of Atlantis Could Be A Hint Of The Topic Of Interest For National Treasure 3... I Am Sure That This Subject Could Be More Interesting Than The Fountain Of Youth... City Of Atlantis In The Bermuda Triangle... That Hasn't Been Done Yet.... The Holy Grail Has Been Done, The Crystal Skull Has Been Done... Maybe A Renewal Of The Ark Of The Covenant, But Atlantis Has Only Been Done In Cartoons And With Todays Computer Effects Atlantis Is Very Doable!!!",Null,1,1,8 June 2008
