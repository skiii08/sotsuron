Hereditary," Rubbish!!!
","If I was watching this at home I'd have turned off after 1/2hr! Absolute tosh! The only reason I didn't walk out of the cinema was that I'd paid hard earned cash to watch it! There's a button underneath the review section that asks if there are any spoilers in my review....nothing to spoil! The plot was thin, the acting was wooden, and by that I mean Keanu Reeves wouldn't of looked out of place!! My advice, save ya money for a burger at one of the big burger joints. That'll be more satisfying.",3,2,4,23 June 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Malek is brilliant!
",I've been excited to see this for months. Finally got to see it and I was not disappointed. Malek was outstanding as Freddie. I sang along to all of the songs and cried at a few of the sad bits. I'm rating this 10/10 I don't think you will see a better film about Freddie Mercury any time soon.,10,66,115,27 October 2018
The Lion King," Hakuna meh!!
",7 out of 10. The CGI is great the voice over is poor! Some of the actors who must have been paid a fortune for their 'skills' are laughing all the way to the bank. Beyonc√© and Donald Glover are not the best people for the job. Honestly it was a bit lazy in comparison the the original!,7,2,6,21 July 2019
