The Ring," You liked this movie why???
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I saw The Ring twice in the past week, hoping that the second time would change my opinion of it.  If you haven't seen it yet, and would like to pay money to be disappointed, stop reading here to avoid the ***SPOILERS***Unfortunately The Ring tried to give a complex plot to a dull shock movie. It certainly made me think, but the more I thought about it, the more questions arose:1)The end reaveals that Samara comes to kill her victims through the TV 7 days after watching the tape, but how did she kill the two teenagers who were driving in the car?2)It is established throughout the movie that Samara never sleeps, but Aidan tells us that 'the horses keep her up at night.'  Since she never sleeps, this wouldn't be a problem.3)When Aidan  watched the tape, the end shows Samara's arm coming over the top of the well.  This is not on the original tape, as this is the beginning of Samara's appearance when she comes to kill her victims.
4)The end of the movie implies that copying the tape (and showing it to someone else) saves you from death on the 7th day.  Rachel had already made a copy and Aidan had seen it by the time she and Noah are in the cabin. But the TV turns on and the water appears, signaling Samara's appearance, which should not happen if copying was actually the immunity from the certain death.I know there were other points that bothered me in this movie, but I have tried to put them out of my mind, and have included the biggest ones here. For a horror movie, I enjoyed the shock scenes and overthetop settings, but the plot too obviously paves the way for a sequel... The End? (sigh)",3,0,0,31 January 2003
