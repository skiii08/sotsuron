Skyfall," Run - don't walk to see this, a proper movie
","This is the shortest 2 hour and 23 minute movie I have ever seen. From the opening scene through to the end, this movie just pulled me through.It had real story lines threading through it, hence my rating this as a proper movie. It was not just action, or gizmos, although it has plenty of those, but for once these things just support rather than being the story.Its worth pointing out, in contrast to all the nay-sayers slating this movie, that it is the only Bond movie to make it onto IMDb's top 250 list. Also it is the largest grossing movie in the top 10 in its third weekend making more than all the other nine movies after it combined. I like a movie that works at many levels that has grown-up themes as well as action and drama. If you are expecting a thrill ride that does all the story-plot thinking for you, then it possibly is not the movie for you. However if you like something that leaves you turning the story over in your mind afterwards, then this is a treat. The movie never stumbled of failed me once. Up there with Gladiator, Toy Story (falling with style) or Shawshank Redemption.Enjoy.",10,12,25,18 November 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Don't understand the Negative Reviews - solid Trek movie better than most.
","I swore after seeing Thor in 3D that I would never go to another 3D movie. 3D was the only option for ST Into Darkness - and it really works. Wished I had seen it in IMAX now. I really enjoyed this movie. I was at school when the first series was aired. Watched most of the franchise and all of the movies. All of which were between just okay to most excellent. Stand out for me: Series 1, Insurrection, the Archer prequel, Wrath of Khan and First Contact. The action was satisfying. The baddie was awesome. The main plot was good, the human interest sub-plots present and sometimes laugh out loud good to me, the heroic journey plot (Kirk) was woven through it, and the movie develops the relationship of the characters. All bodes well for the future. Loved the reboot. It needed to be done. Look, when Series 1 was made Apollo was the only space programme that was vaguely aimed at something other than sub-orbitally delivered Mutually Assured Destruction. Buses, schools and toilets in America were still segregated. Martin Luther King helped to make sure that Lt.Uhura took the role so a future could be portrayed with an officer on the bridge that was a Negro. The idea that the only good Russian was a dead Russian was very popular during that period of the Cold War. So Series 1 beamed a different picture directly into young minds where science builds and not destroys, that the Cold War is a thing of the past, along with racial discrimination. That's what makes series 1 10/10 for me. And this backdrop has changed - not to mention the science having made some of the guesses look a bit dated. The negative reviews puzzle me. Most of them (about 80%) are single reviews. They have reviewed no other movies. That makes them difficult to trust in any way shape or form. They may even just be a single reviewer with multiple email addresses. Then half of the rest, their reviews and ratings are for movies I have never heard of, or barely heard of. Can't trust them either. Then the remainder seem to be to be from perfectionists, that 'if only I were in charge then...'. To those perfectionists a quote: 'Perfection is the enemy of good' Voltaire. A good movie - not a perfect one. Like every other movie, book, story, fiction, you lay aside your critical faculty and enjoy it for what it really is. Star Wars is really enjoyable because it is a story about the struggle of good versus evil. The Matrix is enjoyable because it is the struggle of a sleeping man dreaming they're awake to awaken to their full potential. Shawshank Redemption is really good because it is a story of Red's journey to break free from fear and recover hope. To miss the core element in any movie is to miss the whole point of the movie. And this movie is really enjoyable because it is a good romp, with likable characters, awesome baddies, and it is fun. If you don't like it because it is not a great or perfect movie then get off your behind and make movies that are better. Otherwise enjoy them for what they are, just like we have to enjoy our children - for what they are. Not a great movie, but a good one. Re-watchable. I will buy it to add to my collection. 9/10",9,3,8,19 June 2013
Sin City," A Perfect Screen Adaption of an Excellent Comic
","Hard to know what else to say other than what is in the title.The genre of comic book requires reader effort and imagination to fill the blanks and join the dots between each frame. So this movie requires the same. Especially true of the more adult comics.There is a mistaken assumption that comics, like science fiction are just for children. They can be for children, like most politics is. However, Frank Miller - like Philip K Dick or Kurt Vonnegut - write for adults.You are not spoon fed anything, except excellent visuals and gloriously dark dialogue and authentic Frank Miller story lines.The who's who cast list each give a glorious and iconic performance. They all wanted to be in this movie. It is worth understanding why they wanted to be there.Thankfully, this movie has not Holywoodized the story in any way shape or form (unlike the first attempt at Dredd and the especially horrible adaptation of Electra: Assassin also written by Frank Miller and illustrated by Bill Sienkiewicz.) I hope you enjoy.",10,3,4,16 June 2013
