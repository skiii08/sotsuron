Hereditary," Be warned this is not an easy film to watch
","Like most viewers I thought I had an idea about what this film was about, but, I was side swiped, this film is more akin to the brilliant 'Race with the Devil' with touches of the rosemary's baby and The Devil's Rain thrown in for good measure
But comparing it to these classic horror films is only an attempt to give you an idea of the kind of horror that permeates throughout this movie.
Too often these days we are left disappointed with so called horror films, but please be in no doubt Hereditary is the real deal, it is macabre, suspenseful and very very disturbing.
In truth I cannot say I enjoyed the film, but that is subjective and no reflection on the movie, it does what it set out to do, to scare and disturb the audience and it does this in good measure
If I have any criticisms then I would say it is a little too long and some of the incidents are not properly explained but then that just adds to the mystery and suspense.
The ending seemed a little off kilter, and left me a few questions which I am still mulling over
On that note- I watched this film over a week ago and I am still thinking about it, so be warned this movie will disturb even the hardiest horror fans, little girls blouse - sinister or Annabel this is not!",8,7,12,5 September 2018
Bird Box," 2 hours and 4 minutes of vacuous nonsense.
","2 hours and 4 minutes of vacuous nonsense.
This makes 'A Quiet Place' look good, it must be a really easy gig as a Hollywood script writer as clearly no intelligence or ability is required, I will never understand why people go through the lengthy, expensive and difficult job of making a movie only to employ morons to write the script.
It is difficult to enjoy a movie when there are constant plot holes and the lead characters behave in an unnatural, unbelievable manner.
I feel sorry for Sandra Bullock - who is the only notable stand out in this b quality movie.
She was IMO making some good movies that concentrated more on her acting ability than her amazing good looks but this sub-par movie has undone a lot of that hard work.
All in all a mess of a movie and that is a real pity",2,3,5,3 January 2019
A Quiet Place," underwhelming.
","This is not a bad film but then it is not a good one.
the premise behind the movie is good, although we are never given much of a back story one assumes the status quo as reality,early on there is tragedy which given the nature of this, one would have expected more of a reaction, so for me this apparent lack of empathy towards this terrible event spoiled the movie for me.From this point i really could not engage with the performers and really could not care less about them.
I understand that they had to be 'muted' but it just did not feel real
I watched the film through but can definitely say i will never watch it again or recommend it to anyone.it is instantly forgettable and if there is anything to note from it, it is that this could have been a great film but as too often happens the director made a fist of it.I know reviews are subjective and sometimes staged I can assure you my reviews are genuine and reflect my own opinions",5,2,3,28 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," I hate it when idiots destroy my childhood memories
","The latest and worst star wars movie ever
Although lets be honest they have not been that great even the originals had their flaws but this latest movie is the LAST nail in the coffin 
RIP STARWARS",1,12,18,10 March 2018
Blade Runner," the best film ever made
","Perfect in every way!!!from the sound track, the acting the incredible cinematography
this is film 101It is hard to believe this is from the same Ridley Scott who brought us the awful Alien: Covenant
maybe creating perfection is more of a fluke than a norm but Riley has given us some of the best movies ever.if you get a chance please read or watch Ridley's interview regarding the making of Blade runner, you will find it very revealing, he was constantly being pushed and threatened by the mob who had financed the movie.the final scene with Rutger Hauer had to be shot in one take
The building they were filming in had to be returned to its normal state and they literally had no time left.They had used a stunt double to do the building leap but he could not manage it, the gap was too great for him, so Rutger Hauer in 1 take did the jump the dove scene and even improvised the ending....
Incredible!I think this movie is better than the book, how often can anyone say that?do you think Rick Deckard is a replicant?I could go on and on but i am sure others have covered all the nuances of this film far better than i ever couldI can watch this film over and over again and find something new in it every timea true masterpiece!",10,3,5,16 January 2019
