Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The worst plot hole imo
","I won't repeat all the stuff said 1000 times.Let's just think about the main plot hole imo:
There is a boy who get's no training by Jedi masters due to his age and his feelings that could lead to the dark side. Out of no reason the Jedi councel later on allows the freshest and most inexperienced Jedi master to train exactly that boy. So a Jedi council aware of the potential danger for the whole galaxy just allows things to happen...aaalright!",3,0,2,11 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Can someone flash me please?
",I had low expectancies and got dissapointed.First of all let's point out the things I truly liked about this movie. There is the often epic looking scenery underlined with John Williams powerful good old themes. The saber fights were more intense than in old movies and much more realistic than the circus hopping in I-III.The whole rest of the movie is hard to endure. There is too much non sense happening and the force has just become and excuse for all of it. In the old movies you could somehow feel the limitations one individual had in using the force. Now for no reason everything seems possible.The whole script makes absolutely no sense at all and I'm feeling like I need someone to flash me so I won't think about it anymore.,2,10,16,8 May 2020
Oblivion," Above average sci-fi post-apocalyptic movie
","I didn't know what to expect of this film. Overall I like movies with apocalyptic and/or post-apocalyptic character and also many kinds of science fiction. Compared to all movies in those categories this one is slightly above average. Special effects are awesome and Tom Cruise is the best choice for this kind of movie. Sadly the writing was mediocre as the main twist and the following action was obvious. For me it's comparable to Elysium, just a touch better.",6,1,3,25 May 2019
