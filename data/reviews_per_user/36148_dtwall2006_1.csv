Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," only one word for it - awesome
","Borat : cultural learnings of America for make benefit glorious nation of Kazakhstan. this film is rude , offensive , racist ,crude but most of all hilarious.It is at the top of my top 10 films of all time and i cant see it being taken down by any of the recent ' comedy' movies being released. i have never laughed so much at a film in my whole life ,from the opening line to the end credits i was crying with laughter especially at the hotel scene. its nice to see someone having the guts to make a film that tries to insult everyone . go and see it if you already haven't , it is well worth it ( unless you are easily insulted or don't have a sense of humour.",10,1,13,4 May 2007
