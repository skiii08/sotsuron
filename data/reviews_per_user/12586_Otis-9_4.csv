The Blair Witch Project," Pretty Scary!!!
","This movie took a while to really get going.  I suppose it's understandable that a certain amount of background information is necessary to get rolling on a movie like this, but be forewarned:  you might find the first hour or so a little boring! (I certainly did...)  That said, overall it's a damn good movie.  The suspense building up to the ending is nothing short of intense.  You are witness to the deterioration of these film students lost in the woods as they get more and more desperate to find their way back to civilization and an unknown presence that appears to be hunting them.  The background information on the movie is fairly compelling, I saw a special on the Sci-Fi channel after I watched the movie that made it more interesting. It is very hard not to ultimately get drawn into this movie after the boring sections.  You will be very surprised at the ending.  You will also not want to be in the woods at night for a long time.  If you don't catch this one in the theater, it's a definite rental for sure!!",8,1,1,1 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good but not great
","I started out on this movie with an 8 out of 10 rating but after I saw it two more times I am sorry to say that I now have it at a 6.  I found it to be good overall but most of the exhilaration of a new 'Star Wars' after 20 years wore off after I saw the movie again.  The story was good overall but had some problems (I don't want to get into a rabid Star Wars debate so I'll spare you).  There was a decent amount of action too, and the special effects (in particular the pod race) set a new standard for high quality. My biggest problem in this story was character development.  It's been my experience that most of the people that disagree with me on that point have read the books.  I am sure that to those of you who have read the books would probably agree, but I feel like Lucas was trying to do too much with this story and didn't have enough time to develop everyone fully.  That leads me to my conclusion:  I firmly believe that Star Wars, Episode 2 will be a 10 out of 10 movie.  The stage has been set for some great storyline, which was part of the reason I felt Episode 1 was lacking -- it had to set up the storyline for the entire Star Wars dynasty.",6,0,1,5 July 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Awesome Film
","The show started getting stale, but the movie really brought the excitement and cleverness of the first few episodes (as seen on Comedy Central) back to me.  This film was amazingly funny and clever.  There was layer upon layer of satire, often so subtle that you might miss much of it the first time you see it due to the fact that you will be laughing to hard to notice.  There are Star Wars, Peanuts, Ross Perot parodies just to name a few.  If you are easily offended you will dismiss this movie outright and not see it for what it is:  a beautifully done parody.",7,0,0,5 July 1999
The Thin Red Line," It's no Saving Private Ryan
","Maybe you're not supposed to compare the two movies but it's hard not to since they were released within a few months of one another.  There was far, far, far too much soliloquy and narrative in this movie.  I think the characters' emotions were well summarized by their acting but a few less dream sequences, flashbacks, etc. would have done this hard-to-follow movie well.  Nothing in particular tied this movie together.  I felt the filmmakers were trying to insult my intelligence by telling me about the 'horrors of war' this way, rather than Saving Private Ryan's letting you experience the 'horrors of war' and letting you draw your own conclusions. The audience isn't stupid.  The acting was good overall but the story really sucked.  And what was with all those pointless cameos? (esp. George Clooney's 2 or so lines of speech at the end)  Overall I voted a 1 on this movie.  There was just nothing good about it.  Why do films like this have to be released in pairs (a la Dante's Peak / Volcano, ad infinitum)?",1,11,19,24 January 1999
