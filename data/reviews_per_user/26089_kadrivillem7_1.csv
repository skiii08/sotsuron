10 Cloverfield Lane," Good movie with a terrible ending
","Haven't written a review before, but just had to write about this movie. A friend recommended it as a great movie, I wasn't so sure in the beginning. Half way through the movie it seemed it's really gonna be quite good. The casting has been great, the characters are played well, they are believable. I really looked forward to what's gonna happen. I had no idea, I hadn't read the reviews. And then came the ending... seriously?? Thought quite a few better ways to end this movie...Would have been 8-9/10, but the ending was really disappointing.",5,1,4,31 May 2016
