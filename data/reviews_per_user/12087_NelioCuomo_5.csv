Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Jar to the Jar to Bang Da Dang Diggy Diggy
","A long, long time ago, in a city far away, I walked into a crowded theater to watch the beginning of the first chapter. Star Wars nerd was I. Ready to be completed and fulfilled, hoping I wasn't going to die before the final movie was projected into my frontal lobe and the saga was finally completed.Then... say hello to Jar Jark motherf***ing Binks. Okay, I know that the criticism of Jar Jar has been overdone and in October of 2008 their is little else to say about the character most crucified this millennium by pop culture. Maybe he was part of the whole racist thing along with the Trade Federation Asians (Choy-pee-songy!).Kids aren't great actors so Lil' Anakin Skywalker comes off as unrealistic and rushed. 'I'm a great fighter pilot!!!' Riiiiight.... you're freaking nine years old, bro, reeeelax...Now that it's out of the way, and realizing this movie was meant for kids, I need to say that Liam Niesson was made to play a Jedi. Natalie Portman as Amadala is another bright spot but it also messes with me because she's playing the hottest fourteen year old I've seen in a movie since Dominique Swain wore the Lolita mantle. Early signs a ridiculous love triangle with Anakin and Obi-Wan are set down when Anakin's a freaking nine-year old. I love it.Darth Maul was a pretty awesome concept of a character if he only was in the movie more than about fourteen minutes. The evil element was thrown so far in the background that it sort lowered the fear factor towards the whole 'Sith Lord Comeback' angle which could have been way better.Damn, the more I talk about this movie the more I realize it could be a rated a ten so easily but the tying of loose ends and the attempt at making it kid friendly really hampered it. Saying that, though, the movie looks so beautiful and to quote Kevin Smith (through a cartoon character lawyer in Clerks: Uncensored) 'Objection, your honor. The pod races were pretty cool.' How long before a bright edgy film maker takes it upon himself to remake this one. Where's Richard Donner when he's needed? Okay, it gets a seven because it's freaking Star Wars and that's the lowest score I could possibly muster but in the Star Wars scale it's a one. So I have to live with watching this one every time I cycle through George Lucas' masterpiece in chronological order.",7,1,2,25 October 2008
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Surprise... Surprise... A great movie...
","Surprise, surprise...One of the best romantic comedies I've seen in a long time. I was initially very skeptical of Jason Segel as a leading actor, but after watching this I truly feel he has the most potential of the 'Apatow Crew.' He comes off as very believable playing the victim of a bad breakup with an overbearing woman. I have to say, that this movie was as real as it gets (with the exception of everyone being successful actors and musicians which isn't very 'real,' but for movies sake I'll relent).Jason Segel shines the brightest and the fact that he wrote the movie may be why he seems so real in the character's skin. Overall, the balance of Apatowian crude humor and the passable and stomachable romantic aspects of the movie really make for an enjoyable passing of time. A new must-see, along with Swingers and Annie Hall, for gentleman in great need of getting over their very own Sarah Marshalls.",8,1,4,14 September 2008
Wanted," Suspend belief for an out-there comic like story and...
","I guess some times you really can't tell what's going to hit and what's going to miss.Something I need to preface before the review is that this movie was shot basically in my neighborhood in Chicago and that reason alone ramps up nerd points. Imagine, Angelina Jolie running and spraying bullets in your backyard. It would be a little more effective than if say she's pelting through the Vatican.Preface aside, this movie was pretty awesome. I didn't come in with high hopes but it really hit home with me. I used to have a corporate stuffy job with a boss and accounts and blah blah blah. There are tons of better movies out there that better deal with corporate malaise (Office Space), but this one felt particularly real.It wasn't without it's problems, the story gets down-right silly at some points. Morgan Freeman's role is pretty stupid. I think it's almost a joke, he's recycled the old sage role that it's time to put a moratorium on him acting at all. Stick with the voice overs for the next three-four years, perfect timing for him to come out with some Nelson Mandela movie he can probably rock out on.The secondary acting was terrible, particularly some dude who plays his friend (Barry). He was terrible, and his girlfriend was pretty bad, too.The ending is good, though. Angelina Jolie is always wicked hot, but I can tell she's older than when she was in Hackers. Normally, I just can't tell.Go see this movie. I can go on and on but it's enough to say it's really good. As a GTA playing, ultra-violence loving, white male aged 18-35, I can speak for all of us and say it delivers.",8,0,2,15 September 2008
Hancock," Will Smith.... Give me a freaking break...
","This movie took a fantastic concept and fell into the trap of many large Hollywood blockbusters.I was excited initially, as the story of a superhero who doesn't want to be one strikes me as something of a truer telling of superhero lore. Of course, throw Will Smith into the role and it turns into a sappy feel-good crapper.This would have been the role Tom Cruise should of played. Anyway, Jason Bateman was okay, but I don't understand why he has to play the pitied father with a dead wife who really loves his son. The whole time I was wishing I was watching 'Arrested Development.' Anyway, Charlize Theron is always hot but her role didn't make too much sense. Neither did the big 'twist' at the end.I guess if you're bored and you feel you need to watch every single summer blockbuster to stay involved with pop culture. Hancock isn't too much of a waste of two hours or so.",4,1,3,14 September 2008
High Fidelity," This is in the top five movies of all-time
","One of the top five best movies of all-time about the fear and loneliness that is settling down. I decided to revisit this masterpiece after I paged through Nick Hornby's novel that inspired this Chicago filmed classic.It is unbelievable that movies can sometimes just hit you and let you know that other people have experienced exactly what you're feeling (probably one billion times before, like even cavemen looked at their girlfriends once or twice and said, 'that's it, eh?'). Most people will take this as a movie about breaking up (but it's not), and lots of people just see this move as a chick-flick for dudes (but it sort of is). It's the greatest dude-flick of all time (if you count Terminator 2 and The Matrix as 'guy movies' and say Swingers as another 'dude flick').Being a business owner in his mid-twenties who used to live in the same neighborhood Championship Vinyl was in skews my opinion a bit, but I have to say that the movie is about growing up in the twentieth century. We're not supposed to be married at twenty-one anymore and that creates a lot of time to mess up our relationships and turn into jaded, pessimistic, intelligent, nerds. Cusack is so believable in this role, and you like this character so much that you find yourself defending his flaws in your own mind. He creates a character that allows the viewer to suspend judgment. I suddenly find myself scanning through the minutia of my own hobbies looking for the smallest details to enjoy. Few movies make you think about them after they're long done, but I make constant correlations to myself and Rob as much as possible. It becomes a parable to live by.It gets a nine because the ending isn't perfect. Most of the time I turn the movie off right when the girl comes in to give him an interview. I can't stand the real ending of this movie, or the book for that matter. This movie is so much like real life that it kills me that the ending drapes itself in a fairy tale. As if to say, 'Okay ladies, I know you'd all be angry if it ended like real life right now, so to please all sexes I'll throw a little happy ending in for you.' Hmm... sounds like a masseuse I know...There are scenes in the book where Rob is hanging out with his parents that are not in the movie. Where Rob contemplates suicide because some nerd-looking-thirty-five-year-old enjoying a movie with his parents smiles at him to clue him into being in the same predicament. Rob takes the smile as a clue-in to his hell. It's a classic reading moment where you're literally laughing out loud (instead of the figurative internet way that makes my brain want to explode). Plus, the whole funeral scene is completely different in the movie. The book in general really comes off as so much more anti-women. Laura isn't so damn lovable. Except that I really don't see how people can find Iben Hjejle sexy, or even likable really.Cusack is better in this movie, than anything I've seen him in. Jack Black is perfect as Barry and is closest to his novel character. I can very much tell Jack Black is a Hornby fan (hmmm.... thirty-something stoner with a rock band... is that such a stretch?) I can sit around saying how great the book was, but the only thing that matters is that the movie really gave it justice and if I'm Nick Hornby, I owe a big one to Frears and Cusack for really giving my readership a little (no, a big) reach-around.",9,1,2,17 September 2008
