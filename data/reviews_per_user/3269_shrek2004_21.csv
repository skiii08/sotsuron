Antz," A Bug's Life vs. Antz
","This is an OK movie. Not bad, but not great either. It came out thesame year as A Bug's Life and A Bug's Life defenitely overshadowed this flick. I would have to say A Bug's Life isprobably funnier. It is overall the better movie. However, that's notto say Antz isn't good too. It has a lot of serious, important partsand has more realistic colours (but that also makes it kind ofboring to watch). Also I feel the storyline is a bit more believablethen that of A Bug's Life, although there are similarities betweenthe two main charactars. But there are some tedious parts in thismovie too. I would say, only rent this if you are anti-Disney or have seen ABug's Life. I give Antz a 6/10",Null,0,0,6 July 2003
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Natalie Portman.
","This is not the greatest movie ever made. The original 'Star Wars'and 'The Empire Strikes Back' are much much better. I've onlyseen this movie once, but Natalie Portman should have won anAcademy Award for her stunning and powerful performance as theQueen, Amidala. She was breathtaking! The special effects arealso very good. The plot is passable.",Null,1,3,12 September 2003
The Ring," Lacks a good storyline.
","This is a horror movie, but if you've seen other horror movies youwon't be scared. It's good though, and some scenes are genuinelyterrifying. But the Ring lacks a good story. It's plot is very thin andconfusing, which makes it rather boring. Go see the remake of 'Carrie' instead.",Null,1,2,22 September 2003
Erin Brockovich," A multi-faceted picture
","I never paid attention to the Oscars when Julia Roberts was giventhis one, so I don't remember anything about it (except herbeautiful black and white dress) But her performance in this moviewas good. It wasn't just some romantic comedy, but the characterswere real and had depth. The people who don't think Juliadeserved the Oscar because all she did was 'wear sleazy clothingand swear' were really missing a lot of the characters otherattributes. The sleazy clothing and swearing were just a cover upfor her character. So no one got too close and hurt her again.  Andthe sleazy clothing was what SHE liked and she didn't care if noone else liked it. Erin Brockovich was tough and smart. The storyis very compelling and I did notice there were a few 'inconsistencies' in the plot. I also think Albert Finney should havewon for Best Supporting Actor, but so what? It was a still a greatperformance anyway. The story, while I know a few details havebeen altered , is compelling and scary and good.",Null,0,2,19 September 2003
Erin Brockovich," No bad parts!
","This is a good movie. It is both scary and dramatic when you think about the damage big corporations can do without thinking of the consequences to the ordinairy person. Julia Roberts is excellent in the title role  and Albert Finney, though not as good, his performance is still Oscar-worthy. There are no tedious parts in this movie, although the plot doesn't exactly go very fast it is still gripping. I give this movie 9/10.",Null,0,1,5 July 2003
Spice World," Fun
","This movie has absolutely no substance, but it's a fun, campymovie which parodies the Spice Girls, their fans, and their rise tofame. It's not intelligent, and it's not a work of art but it's a perfectclean-cut affair for little kids and teens. There are evenappearances by George Wendt and Elvis Costello!",Null,0,1,11 November 2003
Spice World," Interesting.
","An interesting movie. On one hand, the Spice Girls were justraking in more dough with a quick movie, but on the other this filmis a clever spoof of their stereotypes and their intense fame in thelate '90s. Now no one cares. It would be funny if Britney Spearsever tried something like this, but I doubt she is intelligent enoughto recognize the film genre. What's good about this movie is thatit's fairly realistic, at least in the world of pop stars, and  you can letyour kids watch it because there are no lewd or violent scenes.",Null,0,1,14 September 2003
Finding Nemo," Rivals Shrek
","WARNING: CONTAINS TWO TEENY SPOILERS!After 1999, when Toy Story 2 came out, I basically assumed that 3-D animated films were a lost cause. Then Shrek came out (I'm waiting for the sequel, as you can see, with excitement!) and the genre was revitalized! Later that year Monsters Inc came out, a great film but there was no competition between it and Shrek. Jimmy Neutron was just for the kids. Then Finding Nemo came out! This film is defenitely as good as, or possibly better than Shrek. This is the best Disney film in years. The animation is beautiful and seamless. It is both the funniest film and the most dramatic film (the 'keep swimming' scene with the salmon, for example) at the same time. The score is excellent, and the hilarious scenes in the dentist office hold the comedic glue of this film together. I hope this one wins Best Animation Oscar for '03. Congratulations Disney!",Null,0,0,5 July 2003
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Predictable
","This film is very flawed. Kate Hudson is very good, but it wouldhave been funnier to see an A-list actress to play the 'clingy, needygirlfriend.' Julia Roberts might have even turned this into another'Notting Hill' or 'Sleepless in Seattle'. Matthew is hot, but that's all.He's just a guy, a guy playing a role. The movie still manages topull it together, it's not trashy or raunchy, just predictable andunexciting.  The movie is tedious and goes along as follows, withboth parties feeling guilty until......hey, I don't need to includespoilers. This is an American movie, with American stars. We know how it ends.",Null,0,0,26 July 2003
"Monsters, Inc."," I'm a fan!
","This is a great movie, however defenitely not as funny as Toy Storyor Finding Nemo.  I have to agree that the animation Pixar does isquite stunning, except for the way humans are done. The flesh isflat, the colours are wrong, and they look like marionettes. This isvery much improved in Finding Nemo, but there is much room forimprovement. Anyways, the plot is good and there are a lot oflaugh-out-loud moments.",8,0,1,19 July 2003
Bridget Jones's Diary," Terrible and unfunny.
","(WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS)This was a terrible, unfunny movie that didn't follow the plot of the book at all. Although Renee Zellwegger gave a good performance, the writing for this movie was off (and so was Hugh Grant's hair). They couldn't get ANYTHING write in this movie. There was no fight scene, and where was Dan, the Australian guy? The first scene, where Bridget is lip-synching--what is that? This movie was awful, and Colin Firth was just wooden. I give this movie 1.5/10",2,1,2,4 July 2003
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Sub-Par
","(spoilers) This Potter film is not worth seeing. Fans will be sorelydisappointed. While the other films had an element of humour,and yes, magic about them, this film is sorely lacking. It'sincredibly boring and the plot has been so twisted around it looksmore like a Harry Potter Magazine. HE DOESN'T GET THE BROOMAT THE END OF THE MOVIE, YOU FOOLS!!!!!  And where was ChoChang and Sir Cadogan? COME ON! Fudge's hat was lime green,not dark.......?  I am sure this travesty is due to the changing ofdirectors as the other two Potter movies were excellent. I certainlyhope Mike Newell does a better job than this Alfonso quack.And I'm pretty sure werewolves have hair, too.",Null,0,0,5 June 2004
The Butterfly Effect," A Sub Par Excellent Film
","(spoilers)The Butterfly Effect doesn't have great writing or great acting. Theplot is confusing and actually gets so in-depth you forget whatactually happened in the first place. But an important thing in thisfilm is the raw emotion, the terrifying effects that are caused by thesmallest action and the different outcomes that can happen. The raw emotion and the different outcomes are what save themovie from being a mess. Ashton Kutcher is good, not great, and with some more experienceoutside Sitcom World he could perhaps achieve that greatness.Even though she appears as the same character in about sixdifferent universes, Amy Smart is defenitely not given enoughscreen time and she is not the actress I would have envisioned forthe part (we see the child version of her character in the firstscenes). Evan's mother, is underused here. Her jaded, thoughoptimistic and determined character never changes, only theexperiences. The plot is so twisting and has so many different twists that theaudience forgets the original reason in the first place. The moviefails to put emphasis on the most important scene, the scenewhere Kayleigh the Waitress and Evan part in the night, so halfwaythrough the movie you forget why you're watching, plot-wise.Well, except for the raw, terrifying emotional depth. I give it 6/10.",Null,2,6,31 January 2004
The Insider," Very interesting.
","This is a true story that took place in the mid-90s (you can tell bythe oversized glasses and cell phones, lol) about an executive inthe tobacco company that was laid off and told a story about hiswork in the tobacco industry and how the customers who becameaddicted to nicotine were lied to. He went on 60 Minutes. Of coursehe is also threatened, his life is put in jeapordy, and he is stalked. Other complications come up along the way as well. Some of thedetails of the true story are altered, such as the ages of hischildren, but these details are very minor. If you liked  ErinBrockovich, you will like this!",Null,1,1,12 September 2003
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," I'm skeptical of it's sucess, but it's still a great movie.
","This film picks up from the first and the plot just takes off. Some ofthe best minor parts of the book are ignored.  However, thehumour that you didn't see a lot of in the first film is definitelypresent here. Everyone in the film lives up to their part in the book.My only quarrel with the acting is Emma Watson, sometimes sheseems to read her lines too fast. Despite minor flaws, all in all a good film. 9/10!",Null,0,1,8 August 2003
Ice Age," Ice Age stands alone.
","While the animation is much simpler than Shrek, and the storylineisn't as complex as Finding Nemo, Ice Age stands alone. Thecharactars are well developed, like the sabre-toothed tiger whostruggles between his instincts and doing what is right. The woollymammoth, Manfred, was a perfect part for Ray Romano.  I give this5 stars out of 5.",Null,0,2,7 August 2003
Shrek," Animation will never be the same.
","Animation has taken some great leaps in recent years. Because ofthe Simpsons, it has become more popular and taken moreseriously as 'more than kids' stuff' because of computertechnology, it has become quality art instead of just flippingpost-its. Shrek was a very groundbreaking film in 2001. Because of it'sengaging storyline, beautiful plot, funny, multi-faceted charactarsand impressive animation, it finally broke the barrier that animationwas not just cartoons and thin plots, but that it could be takenseriously in a movie, so seriously in fact that because of Shrek, theBest Animated Film Oscar category was created. I love Shrek. It's my favourite movie. I've defenitely seen betterfilms, but Shrek remains number # 1 with me. I can't wait for thesequel!",10,1,2,27 August 2003
The Truman Show," Good, but just good.
","I remember in 1999 there were lots of news stories about how Jim Carrey was angry at the academy for not being nominated for the Truman Show. I think Jim Carrey was very proud of himself at taking on a serious role and being able to perform it almost flawlessy. But this is just a good movie--good, not great. If anyone deserved an Oscar, it was Ed Harris in the role of Christof or Laura Linney as his wife Merrill.",Null,0,0,5 July 2003
A Walk to Remember," Book is better.
","This is an extremely boring remake of the wonderful book, 'A WalkTo Remember' by Nicholas Sparks. Mandy Moore and ShaneWest are decent in their roles, but there is  little here for them to actdo, actually.  The movie actually takes very little material out of thebook, so the two barely resemble each other. If the movie hadstayed true to the book, it could have been a real winner. Sadly,this piece of tripe falls flat.",Null,0,0,17 October 2003
A Walk to Remember," I hated it.
","This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The plot is so boring andtreads along slowly. Mandy Moore is not really that much of anactress in this film at least, all she seems to do  is stand therewhile her lips quiver. It's a terrible romance movie and nothingexciting happens. I guess it might be good for  a sleepover......ormaybe a cereal box promo....whatever!!",Null,0,0,25 July 2003
Pocahontas," Dramatic and exciting.
","This is a fine film. I think that if the 'Best Animated Feature' Oscarcategory had been around then, this would have won it. It has greatanimation and fine charactars. This is a dramatic and excitingmovie, and it has some humour. I guess the only problem with it isthat it didn't stay true almost at all to  the story of the realPocahontas, but then what Disney film does?",Null,0,2,23 September 2003
