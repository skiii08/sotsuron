50 First Dates," This movie was hilarious!
","This movie had me laughing so hard I thought that I would pee my pants. The whole theater was in laughter half the time.  My favorite character was Lucy's brother, played by Sean Astin.  It was nice to see him in such a comedic role and between his lisp and his wardrobe, he had me laughing every time he was in a scene. I'd recommend seeing this movie to anyone who loves Adam Sandler's sense of humor.  It is both sweet and funny.",10,0,0,14 February 2004
