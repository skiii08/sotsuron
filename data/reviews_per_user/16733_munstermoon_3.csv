First Man," Boring
","Has some pretty cool special effects and action sequences on the realistic side, which I appreciate, but it is too loud and in your face close-ups that are overdone, especially in IMAX. Otherwise, it has some really bad family relationship stuff that is not warm and human and just downright boring. Could not stand the actress who played his wife, so if his wife was like that she was a great actress. They also made Buzz Aldrin look like a selfish jerk just there for his own glory, while everyone else was portrayed as humble and team oriented. I've met Buzz a couple of times and he was a great guy, and a man's man and I'm sure no more arrogant and cocky than that breed of pilots had to be to do that job.",4,178,329,11 October 2018
American Made," Nothing close to historical or biopic
","I like movies that take some liberties with biopic / historical stories to make the story more dynamic and entertaining, but this was so far removed from what really happened that it came across as a political hit piece, so much so I'm surprised they didn't work in an anti-Trump bit somehow, as they conveniently left out details of Bill Clinton's banana republic operation in Arkansas. Look at broadcast interviews of Barry Seal boastfully showing how he stung the drug lords and Sandinistas, yet in the movie he was thrown under the bus by Reagan and Oliver North...Give me a break, using the actual names of historical players does not give a license to the rewriting of history - those idiots espousing that it blows the doors off some scandal probably believe that Abraham Lincoln was in fact a Vampire Hunter.",1,9,16,20 January 2018
Arrival," If you have insomnia...
","Wow, I think I could write scripts for movies now, or at least take this as a script for insomnia.I do not usually write reviews, because most IMDb reviews seem to fall in line with how I feel, versus rotten tomatoes, but this one I do not understand how it has such high reviews; it sucks! and I had to fast forward to get through it - after I woke up that is.",1,8,15,25 February 2017
