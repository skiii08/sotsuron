Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," So Worth It!
","I almost literally counted the days until BORAT arrived in theaters, having become a fan through HBO's DA ALI G SHOW. I went on the day it opened and every expectation I had was fulfilled. This is by far the funniest, craziest comedy to come around in years. I knew I'd laugh my ass off, but so did everyone else in the theater. There is something familiar about the subplot: foreigner comes to US to chase a dream, the struggles that go along with it, then the heartbreak ending. This allowed us to see a more humane side of Borat that we never saw on ALI G. I highly recommend BORAT to all true fans, as well as those who love physically-oriented slapstick comedy. Cohen is a comic genius, plain and simple. It was worth the wait. Even though DA ALI G SHOW may be history, Borat is here to stay.",10,3,18,10 November 2006
