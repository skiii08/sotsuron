Blade Runner 2049," Superb...
","Simply put, if you have not seen the original, it may be a bit confusing. I recommend seeing the 'Final Director's Cut' of the original Blade Runner before viewing this movie.Having said that, at first I was confused thinking I had it all figured out very early in the movie. Quite frankly I was angry. Then all the loose ends made sense. Reflecting back through the entire movie and the original, this was probably the best sequel I have ever seen in my 42 years of life. I understand now why Blade Runner 2049 had a slow start in theaters - today's audiences expect plots to be spoon-fed to them. I encourage any sci-fi lover to really sit back and take every moment of this film.My hats off to everyone, cast and crew, for making an astounding movie, staying true to canon, making a very cerebral, and most thought-provoking sequel that will certainly please old and new generations.",10,3,11,18 October 2017
Doctor Strange," Inception Meets The Marvel Universe and a Wise-***
","Watered down plot, a whole lot of 'Inception' effects, throw in the Marvel universe, add a gratuitous and pathetic tie in to The Avengers: Infinity War, and Benjamin Cumberbatch to make the ladies swoon. Doctor Strange was a good idea, however it seems the Marvel Universe seems to have sold out with this latest introduction to the superhero catalog.The CGI action scenes were far from subtle, and very overloading. It reminded me of Michael Bay's Transformers movies. The movie itself was too short to tell the whole backstory of Doctor Strange, and a lot of that character development was lost. The plot itself moved too quickly to really gain the momentum that you wanted to feel for Doctor Strange and his plight, but fell short. Was the studio ACTUALLY trying to make a movie about Doctor Strange? No. Like Suicide Squad, Doctor Strange was a quickly thrown together mish-mash of the Doctor Strange we grew to enjoy in the comics to tie the characters into The Avengers: Infinity War, by pathetically revealing at the end that heart of the amulet Doctor Strange wore was an Infinity Stone. Don't waste your money on even renting this film. Stan Lee should be ashamed for even doing his signature cameo in this one...",3,2,5,18 February 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Judge For Yourself - Go See The Film!
","First off, great film, a lot of fun, a lot of action, a lot of stuff to leave you hanging, and a lot of stuff to keep you wondering. Now, admittedly, I have not reviewed many films, but just a note - consider the source of your reviews - a lot of these users have been on IMDB for an alleged 4 to 10 years and only writing ONE review? And that ONE review is to trash Star Wars? Something doesn't seem right here. Just go see the film - remember - this is a new trilogy - the 'passing of the torch' - a new generation - and completely uncharted territory.Your own opinion is what matters most - love it or hate it - you take the story with you. ...heck, I hated the prequel trilogy, but I least rated them fairly.",9,1,10,15 December 2017
Life," Leave The 'Alien' Movies to Ridley Scott
","In all fairness, 'Life' was a good in theory, bad in practice. How I felt about the movie going in was much different from the experience, and then leaving the theater. I went from, this is kinda cool, spooky, emotional, scary, even more emotional, to a plot twist at the very end that simply was wrong for the movie. That left me with a very poor taste in my mouth about 'Life', so my review of this movie is focusing on its negative aspects. First I will start by saying DID have potential, had the writers, producers, and director had not taken the angle that they did. Originally, because of the ending, I had given the movie 2-Stars, but due to the theater's wonderful recliner seating, I was able to muster- up another star.Right from the beginning, the story was moving way too fast...is this action, drama, horror, comedy, science fiction? I was left aimless trying to figure out which genre to choose from. The character development did become a little more developed as the movie progressed, but it did so at odd and unpredictable times. This left me asking 'What?' too many times during the film.Catching a probe carrying Mars soil samples with an 'arm' at that velocity would have torn the arm off the movie-version of the International Space Station. This is where 'believable-fiction' went straight to 'science-fiction'. Next, they find a single celled organism in the soil samples, alien in nature, and let's wake it up! I think Ryan Reynolds said it best: 'This is some real Re-Animator s***'. The children of the Earth name it 'Calvin'. In what seems to be an extremely short period of time, 'Calvin' becomes a multi-cellular organism and starts interacting with its environment. Why? Writer's Scapegoat - it's alien, it has and endless possibility of script-killers!'Calvin' goes into survival-psycho-killer mode because the foolish scientist let the gas valves leak into the chamber, injuring our newly found friend, and effectively putting it in a 'coma'. But, like a little kid, let's bathe the creature in even more food and while we are at it, let's take a zapper and start poking at it. No wonder it crushed your hand and tried to kill the whole crew. I'd be pretty pi**ed off too! Really begins to make you wonder what mail-order- university these crew members studied at...NASA has a backup plan (of course!) of sending a Soyuz capsule as a booster rocket to dispense of the crew (whomever may be left), the creature, and the station to prevent the Earth from being contaminated by 'Calvin'.This is where it completely defined the movie: The Plot Twist. Plan - get Calvin and Jake Gyllenhaal into an escape pod where he nobly sacrifices his life for mankind, shooting himself and 'Calvin' into deep space, and have the other female crew member use the second escape pod and get back to Earth safely to live to tell the tale...Had the movie ended on this note, I may have given it 6, maybe 7 stars (and that is pushing it). Nobility self-sacrifice for the greater good are traits that are hard to come by these days. BUT NO! Through the cutting between the capsules launching and what was happening inside the capsules, you really BELIEVED this is what was happening. Come to find it was the female crew member's capsule that was flying off into deep space, and Jake Gyllenhaal's capsule splashing down on Earth with him and 'Calvin' - Apocalypse!The worst horror-plot twist in existence, and they had to go and put it in 'Life'. Don't spend the money in the theaters - rent it, get it from Red Box, Netflix, Hulu, or wherever it ends up.",3,20,43,26 March 2017
Annihilation," Another 'Could Have Been'...
","I have no idea what movie people were watching when they reviewed this title. Very little character development, the movie borrowed from way too many other science fiction films, had very low budget effects, and really did not show us anything new, imaginative, or thought provoking. You never felt attached to any of the characters, no fear, no surprise, no wonder, no nothing. I have never said this before in a review, but I actually want my money and my 2 hours of life back...",1,2,5,30 May 2018
