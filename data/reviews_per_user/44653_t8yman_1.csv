Requiem for a Dream," Positive review, very minor spoilers
","I have just watched this movie, its 11 pm and I should really be in bed asleep by now as I am at work at 4am, but wanted to read other peoples views on this movie and maybe add a little of my own. I don't think I have been affected by a movie quite so much in a long time, I don't want to go out and tell all my friends they must see this movie (and why) because I don't want to hype it up out of all proportion, but I know that if I don't they may never see it- I know I picked it up and put it down about 4 different times in the rental shop, and I am glad that I finally took it home and watched it. The editing and direction are incredibly fresh and innovative, and the acting is of a superb standard, you REALLY care for the characters, you feel their sorrow, you feel their emptiness, and most of all you KNOW where they are all heading from the get go, and you know there is no stopping them. Burstyn turns in one of the most incredible performances I have ever seen- The scene where she is visited by Leto is indeed tragic. For me the movie isn't *about* drugs, although they are heavily depicted in various forms. For me the movie was about human weakness, human desire, human emotion and the never ending quest to fulfil our dreams regardless of the consequences and ignoring the fact that upon realising our dreams, we would have nothin left to aim for. Having read back through this 'review', I realise I have told you very little about the movie itself, but I feel its going to be more enjoyable for you to discover it yourself. All I knew about this movie before I saw it was what I had read on the sleeve in the store, and a recommendation from a movie reviewer on the radio, and I'm glad thats all I knew. It's dark, its not an 'easy watch' or a date movie, but you will not regret watching it.You MUST watch the Ellen Burstyn interview with Hubert Selby Junior on the DVD extras if you can, the man is unique!
