Black Swan," A bad directed horror movie of sick taste
","At the start I was only slightly disturbed by the inappropriate scenes of aimless evil inflicted upon the fragile and pure Nina. I wiped them away, and thought a deep drama would unfold about the psychological problems of Nina caused by stress and pressure. But later on I got more and more annoyed by detestable scenes of pain and sex. Especially the sudden shocks (sudden loud sound and movements) every five minutes became highly irritating. I wondered if this was meant to be a horror movie, but then another scene with some warm human response changed my mind. During the movie I had more and more doubts about the actual theme of the film. Where was the director going? What does he want to say? Eventually I got the feeling I was looking at a bad directed sequence of painful and shocking moments, that had no connection with real life whatsoever. At the scene where Nina returns to Beth in the hospital to give her back her lipstick (etc.) and Beth starts stabbing herself with the nail file I said to myself: 'this is enough!' I stopped the movie (dvd) and rigorously took care this garbage will never meet my eyes again. I decided not to lend my mind any longer to be fed with such mental vomit. The maker of this movie has to be a very ill-minded person.",1,10,18,10 July 2011
