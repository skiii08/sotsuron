Lucky Number Slevin," poor mans lock stock
","Don't get me wrong, this film is not the worst I've ever seen. It is fast paced and nicely shot, but they are about the only real positives I can draw. The current rating of 7.8 out of 10 is as ridiculous as the storyline.The plot, in my opinion, is too far-fetched and does not really build suspense or keep you guessing. I think a lot of people have voted highly for this film because the story is all unravelled at the very end, and because it surprises you a bit, you think 'ooh, that was clever', but it really isn't. A good film will give you a few clues along the way to keep you thinking, but this didn't provide a single snippet.Another major flaw, in my opinion, is that none of the characters are convincing (or intimidating) gangsters, and 2 rival gangs in opposing buildings. No. Great gangster films are based on characters that you can imagine existing and running a racket. Once you have got the characters in place, you can run away a bit with the story - a bit like 'Snatch', 'Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels' or even 'Pulp Fiction'.",6,2,5,1 February 2007
Hot Fuzz," another overrated movie
","Hot fuzz is a humorous and light-hearted movie, and I would not hesitate in recommending it to anyone as a good watch. However, i would argue that this is not a brilliant film, and it is at the end of the day, forgettable.I think this movie has scored so highly because it is so refreshing to see a British comedy that works on the big screen. Ultimately though, you can take your pick from dozens of Hollywood comedies that are simply better than this.....starting with the 40 year old virgin.I would score this film between 6 and 7.....but i've gone for 6, because 8.2 out of 10 is over the top.",6,15,39,7 March 2007
