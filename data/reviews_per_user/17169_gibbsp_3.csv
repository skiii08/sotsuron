The Rock," Fourth Best Action Movie Ever!
","Okay, seriously, though. This is the fourth best action movie ever. Bruckheimer has nothing else that compares to this, except maybe Con Air, and, no, it's not a coincidence that Nicholas Cage is in this film. It's obvious that Raising Arizona and Face/Off are his best flicks, but this is unbelievable. So, here's the top four: 1. Raiders of the Lost Ark, 2. Die Hard, 3. Point Break, 4. The Rock. So, the Rock comes in at fourth, but how can you beat an archaeologist(directed by Spielberg) fighting Nazis for the Ark of the Covenant, Bruce Willis fighting Germans to save Nakatomi Plaza, Johnny F---in' Utah fighting bank robbing surfers (with Gary Busey), etc. But honestly, he drives a volvo, beige. This movie takes what Spielberg did with Last Crusade (a wisened Sean Connery) and made it Alcatrizazed to your mother's c--word. I mean, sticking a needle in your chest is hardcore for a non-heroine addict. Okay, Honeymoon in Vegas was good (so was 3000 Miles to Graceland), but aside from Pirates of the Disney World ride, Bruckheimer took some Bad Boys to the edge here and made one of the most exciting action flicks ever.",10,2,2,15 April 2006
Jarhead," Interesting Psychological Study
","'I was lucky enough to see an advanced screening of this film last night,' says almost everyone who posts early comments. But I was lucky. The film was one of the most intense psychological depictions of soldiers during wartime that I have ever seen, and they only go to war for a very short period of time. Many people seem to get caught up in deciding whether or not this movie is anti-war or whether it bashes marines or agrees with oil conspiracy theories, but those kind of arguments draw away from the cinematic achievements here. During parts of this movie I was so drawn in to the psychological elements of a marine during wartime that I forgot who I was and sympathized with the characters more than I ever have in a war movie before. The acting was pretty amazing. Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard were brilliant in their portrayals of the sometimes humorous, sometimes wild, and sometimes on-the-edge of insanity young men who give up their time and, hopefully not, their lives after going through intense and nearly brainwashing training. *Spoiler?* When you see the two scenes where each of them completely breakdown you'll see what I mean. *End of Spoiler* Jamie Foxx also put on an amazing performance as the staff sergeant who has his times of near compassion as well as his times of being a dick. Aside from the acting, Mendes does a pretty great job of showing the intensity with the hand-held camera, although it gets kind of annoying in spots. He also uses lighting very well, as he usually does, to depict some beautiful yet quite disturbing scenes in the desert, especially *SPOILER* The scenes with the oil fields burning. Those scenes were so intense and hauntingly beautiful *END SPOILER* Overall, I'd say see it if you can stomach it, because the brutal reality was sometimes hard for me to deal with. It's not like watching a really bloody movie, it's way, way more real.",9,3,5,3 November 2005
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Better than crash
","Seriously, that's about it. All movies this year nominated for awards were merit worthy, but I thought this was better than crash. C'est la Vie. I Have To Have Ten Lines of text, however, so I guess I will continue. I believe that this film was very important to the idea of television today. I mean, seriously, reality television is ridiculous. The concept and the invention of television should be used to help better our society. Crash, on the other hand, was kind of like reality Television, but not really--it was more complex. I'm just talking out of my ass to make ten lines worth of commentary. I thought crash was good and all that, but it was too many plots, and the whole feel of the film was kind of hokey, although poignant. It felt overacted and melodramatic. But hey, what do I know, I'm just and IMDb-er. On the other hand, Good Night was too the point, well acted, humorous, important, and pretty great. C'est la Vie, again.",10,1,2,16 March 2006
