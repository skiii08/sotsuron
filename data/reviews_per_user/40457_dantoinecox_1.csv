Blade Runner 2049," The worst part of the movie was the title.
","I've never seen the original Bladerunner nor have I read the books so I don't know if it references to some written prose unknown to me, but Bladerunner 2049??? Seriously??? What I saw in this movie looks like technology from 2149 ðŸ¤” If this is what the future looks like 31 years from NOW, I don't want to be apart of it. Whoever thought this was a good title should be fired from existence.",7,3,8,21 October 2017
