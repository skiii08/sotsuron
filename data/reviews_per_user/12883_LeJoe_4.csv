Requiem for a Dream," A Dark Journey Worth Taking
","Director Darren Aronofsky's previous film effort, known simply as Pi, didn't really impress me that much. It was an overly cryptic, gritty tale that seemed more tedious and frustrating than it was worth.  Requiem for a Dream is his newest outing. It's definitely not a pretty picture either, but it's certainly better and more effective. During the course of its running time, it's guaranteed to produce a cringe or a wince in almost any viewer. It's the kind of film with the capacity to disturb and produce a sense of relief when it ends, even though one is glad to have seen it. Ellen Burstyn is at her frumpy and neurotic best as a television-enslaved, middle-aged woman who gets caught in a drug-addicted frenzy of compulsive behavior. Greatly adding to the intensity and momentum of the story is a similar downfall her son (played by Jared Leto) also experiences.A lot of what makes Requiem work lies in the film's breakneck pacing, structure and cinematography as the two lead characters race toward simultaneous self destruction in different, but equally frightening ways. Depictions of old apartments, bad areas of the city and wasted lives from the ravages of abuse have rarely been more harrowing. In fact, as the film's climax of final scenes unraveled, I was really beginning to squirm; I even toyed with the idea of leaving the theater. Yet like the characters, I was compelled to go all the way. Requiem for a Dream may be many things, and you may not want to see it again very soon. But it is undoubtedly original, unforgettable and a noteworthy contribution to the annals of cutting-edge filmmaking.",Null,0,0,28 December 2000
Memento," Confusion Reigns Supreme
","In director Christopher Nolan's Memento, cryptic filmmaking is taken to new heights as lead character Leonard Shelby (played by the talented and attractive Guy Pearce) grapples with a rare form of amnesia that causes almost instantaneous short-term memory loss on a continuous basis. The last thing he remembers is a brutal incident in which he suffered a head injury when his wife was raped and killed. Consequently, he thrives on taking revenge, desperately trying to find his assailant in a circuitous web of confusion and dead ends. Overall, critics seem to like this topsy-turvy exercise in reverse osmosis, so I expected to be impressed. One of the film's devices is the sequencing of its events, which seems to work backwards from the end to the beginning. We're not just talking about occasional flashbacks either. Instead, we're virtually watching a story in reverse...perhaps a novel, intriguing concept that made excellent fodder for shooting the breeze at Hollywood parties and brainstorming sessions, but which mostly produced confusion to the point of near exasperation when executed. Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie and Joe Pantoliano as Teddy play low-lifes with ulterior motives whom our memory-challenged character gets involved with, adding sordid characters to the overall pandemonium. But ultimately, the film comes off more than anything as an excuse for a cinematic gimmick, an exercise in pointlessness to the level that one really doesn't care about the disjointed plot or the characters any longer. I and others leaving the theater seemed glad it was over but were haunted by some mysteries of our own:  What was really happening in this movie? Should I even care? Why did I see this? Where did I park the car? Oh well, at least it was a bargain matinee. I might have gone on a vengeful rampage of my own had I paid full price.",Null,0,1,9 April 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Flying People, Disappointing Film
","I was very impressed with Ang Lee's 1997 film, The Ice Storm, but I'd been avoiding Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon since I first saw previews for it weeks before it opened. Then, because of unexpected circumstances and a slightly aroused curiosity, I recently found myself in line for a ticket with a couple of friends. As I predicted, in spite of some accolades from various critics and others, the film just didn't work for me. One of the things that bugs me about this movie is the fact that it utilizes very natural, realistic settings, characters and events with two glaring exceptions: people flying through the air and a lack of displayed passion between two of the main characters. As far as the flying thing is concerned, the film just isn't whimsical or fantastic enough to have characters breaking into Peter Pan gymnastics at the drop of a hat. Here is a very real and beautiful environment with people leading essentially believable lives punctuated with kung fu histrionics; yet every once in a while they fly around. Granted, the flying sequences are stupendously handled and somewhat fascinating, but they're just a bit too over-the-top for the overall tone of the material. Another important aspect of the film that deflates its potential impact is the alleged passion between two of the main characters. Action man Yun-Fat Chow plays Li Mu Bai, a warrior ready to retire his prized sword. His love interest is an equally agile Yu Shu Lien, played by Michelle Yeoh. Supposedly they love each other and always have. You know the drill...one of those long-standing, unrealized love affairs that seethes under the surface for decades. Yet their mutual chemistry and passion is not obvious enough to be engaging or captivating to the viewer. It's not until the very end that we finally get a strong sense of their mutual love. Perhaps it's better late than never, but in this case, one isn't quite sure. As much as anything, their late burst of passion almost underscores how much more they could have displayed in previous scenes. Complicating matters, it appears this tendency is caused by a combination of factors: the material, the actors' abilities, the direction and possibly even differences in perception from a cultural (East/West) standpoint. Another debilitating element of the film stems from a somewhat convoluted plot. Li Mu Bai's decision to retire his sword is an important step in his character's development. Especially important is the location of his sword's resting place, or in other words, who has  possession or control of it. The problem with this premise is that the sword floats around quite a bit. One minute it's in one person's hands and the next minute it seems to belong to someone else. An important character in the film is Jen Yu, played by the small but mighty Ziyi Zhang. As a troublesome young aristocrat engaged to be married, her motivations are foggy or confusing at times. She seems to flip-flop from demure and sweet to deadly and nefarious, then back again. Even the man she eventually seems to fall in love with is subjected to her schizophrenic mood changes. As with most contemporary films, the cinematography is stunning, enhanced even more by the beautiful backdrop of China. In fact, someone said China is the real star of this film, and I'm tempted to agree. To be honest, I wanted to like Crouching Tiger a lot more than I did, and I admit I'm unfamiliar with Chinese mythology and literary works.It could be that in its translation and because of cultural differences, it's the kind of film with a potentially uneven appeal and impact-level.",Null,14,27,12 January 2001
Moulin Rouge!," An Innovative, Visual Feast
","There's nothing quite like director Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge; it's in a class by itself...a reinvention of the Hollywood musical in an explosion of color, motion, music and surprises. For some, the frenetic pace of the first half hour or so may be overwhelming and a bit frustrating, as your eyes beg for the camera to slow down. Especially in the large-scale dance numbers, it seems every lightening-fast camera angle has so much going on, your appetite for more and a chance to linger are merely increased. Fortunately, the pace of the film does diminish a little as the story advances. Carrying the plot are Nicole Kidman as the seductive Satine, a courtesan of the highest caliber, and Ewan McGregor as Christian, a struggling writer who hopes to score a hit at the Moulin Rouge. Both actors have never been in better form. Kidman is nothing less than  ravishing as Satine, and in spite of her visual impact, manages to bring an element of humanity to her character...an element that could easily have been lost in a haze of glamour and pretension. Likewise,  McGregor rises above the clamor and brings a sense of genuineness to his portrayal of a lowly artist who is overpowered by his love for Satine and his dream of creating a mega-hit on stage.One of the film's biggest surprises are the singing voices of both actors, especially McGregor's, and the fact that even though most of the film's songs are very familiar, they succeed...thanks to innovative arrangements and staging. Actor Jim Broadbent as Harold Zidler turns in an effective performance as the nightclub's oily proprietor, though John Liguizamo's shrill portrayal of Toulouse-Lautrec was a bit irritating and over the top. Perhaps best of all, the overall plot, which is based on a relatively simple love story, doesn't get overshadowed or become insignificant in spite of the film's highly sensorial, stylized nature. So we end up with a unique cinematic experience that is both visually and viscerally stunning, and emotionally moving. It's the best of all worlds and  heralds a new chapter in musicals on film, maybe even a comeback.",Null,0,1,18 January 2002
