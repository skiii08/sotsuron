The Avengers," Don't kill me for not giving it a perfect 10...
","The Avengers was exactly what I thought it would be: loud, funny, action-filled and FUN. It was a BLAST watching all of the superheroes we've come to know so well fight together and with each other. Hulk vs Thor? YES PLEASE! The Hulk definitely stole the show in an AWESOME way. You probably won't blink once during the action/fight scenes. You wouldn't want to miss anything! All the greatness being said...there just could have been a little bit more to the story. All the fighting and loud noises distract you that there isn't TOO much of a story going on other than 'team-up and save the world from an alien race we don't know much about.' This is where I think I have been spoiled by The Dark Knight. The Dark Knight set the bar for story-telling for superhero movies; it was deep and really touched a nerve. If you cut it, it would bleed. I also wanted Hawkeye, to play a bigger part! ALL of that being said, you get what you expect from watching The Avengers: a REALLY good time where you don't have to think too hard to really appreciate it.",9,3,8,18 June 2012
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Great for the fans, but could have been better...
","I'm a HUGE fan of the Resident Evil games and I do enjoy the movies...even though the predecessors of Afterlife hardly had anything to do with the actual game; Wesker wasn't even mentioned until the 3rd installment, and Jill Valentine's part in 2 pretty much...well..sucked (I thought the actress was horrible and they made her into a total b!tch). Despite all that though, who doesn't like zombie movies? When I saw the trailer for Afterlife, I was PSYCHED! It looked like there was SO much more stuff in it that fans would appreciate and love to see, ie: Wesker and Chris Redfield fight, the big axe guy, etc. Although I loved seeing all of that, I was still kind of disappointed. There was a TON of cheesy slow motion scenes and I was really getting sick of seeing it. I just wanted to yell, 'Just let them fight and stop slowing it down!' The 'big axe guy' fight was VERY disappointing; the character that fought him, shouldn't have. They should have had Chris fight him. Probably the thing I hated the most was Ali Larter doing a backflip off of a wall...yeah, that was so unnecessary. Overall, I did enjoy the movie although not as much as I really wanted to. By the way, after a few minutes during the end credits, a scene will play which leads us to believe there will be ANOTHER movie.",6,0,2,23 January 2011
The Village," Suffered for Being Advertised Wrong
","I just watched this movie the other day when it was on TV. I saw it in the theater when it came out but I didn't really remember it too well. After watching it for a second time, I realized that it was a pretty good movie with a genuinely interesting plot. In fact, all of M. Night's movies are good (except for The Happening...which is the movie we will not speak of). The problem with all of his films including The Village is that they are advertised wrong. The Village was advertised as a horror movie when in actuality, it's not. Ever since The Sixth Sense, everyone has been expecting M. Night to scare them...but this is not what he does. Most of his movies are fantasy-dramas with engaging stories and characters you come to care about. Although scary, even The Sixth Sense wasn't a horror movie. The Village succeeds on so many levels such as in the set design, atmosphere, characters and twist ending. Everyone needs to give M. Night some credit as a master storyteller and quit criticizing him for not being scary enough. His films are enjoyable when you're willing to enjoy them for what they are.",7,1,2,9 March 2011
Insidious," Definitely the Best Scary Movie in a LOOOOOONG Time...
","Insidious is by FAR the best scary movie to come out in what feels like a very VERY long time. It wasn't just a 'good' scary movie, but a genuinely 'scary' scary movie. From the opening shot to the credits, everything just seemed to work. There were no big special effects and there was no cheesy CGI which in my opinion, really brings down the quality of supernatural movies. The scares were genuine and a few parts really had the whole audience gasping and jumping out of their seats. I myself had chills...which hasn't happened with any scary movie in the past 8 years. Granted, it's not a perfect movie, and there are some of the usual scary movie clichÃ©s, but in no way do they rob the movie of being enjoyable. Overall, Insidious is creepy and very scary and most importantly, a FUN movie to watch. It gives you the scare you want and the enjoyment you want from walking through a Haunted House during Halloween time. After watching this movie, horror directors and writers should takes notes and tips from James Wan and Leigh Whannel.",7,7,12,20 April 2011
Kick-Ass," Much Better Than What I Thought it Would Be
","At first, when I saw the previews for Kick Ass, it didn't really look all that interesting...until I saw why it received an R rating. This movie was SO much better than what I thought it would be. The important thing to keep in mind is, don't take it TOO seriously and don't take it TOO personally. People complain about 11 year old Hit Girl having a filthy mouth, a high body count, and bloody murderous fight scenes...but seriously people, GET OVER IT. You see what it's rated R for so it goes without saying that Kick Ass is not for everyone...particularly those that get sick at the sight of blood. If you think a movie is going to be offensive to you...don't watch it...and therefore you won't have to bitch about it later.Kick Ass is bloody good fun, stylish, fast paced and not for the feint of heart. If you're not easily offended (or have a stick wedged up your ass) you're in for a good time.",8,5,11,13 August 2010
Sinister," Not Scary BUT Disturbing
","Sinister is one of the rare horror movies to come out in recent years that actually makes an impression on the viewer by being an original work and will be remembered. I'm a HUGE horror fan, but I have to face the awful truth time and time again that horror movies today SUCK. They suck so incredibly bad. With the exception of Insidious and now, thankfully, Sinister, every horror movie to come out of recent years is certifiable trash. Everything is either a remake from earlier successes, a remake of a more successful foreign film, a movie about demonic possession, 'torture porn' (and I did love the original Saw) or a mash-up of every cliché imaginable overdone with cheap CGI. Sinister works because it avoids all of these.Instead of relying on cheap tricks, Sinister uses atmosphere, mood, tension and pretty good acting to heighten the horror. I didn't find the ACTUAL story all that scary; the 'deity' didn't quite do it for me, but luckily, the movie didn't need to rely on it as its only means to produce scares. The one word that comes to mind when I think of Sinister is DISTURBING. It's not essentially a 'scary' movie but a very dark and DISTURBING one. You understand this from the opening scene. The home videos that Ethan Hawke's character watches will definitely linger with you.Sinister of course isn't perfect. I guessed the ending almost right away and knew what was happening. And why doesn't anyone turn on a light when they hear something scary at night? TURN ON THE FREAKIN' LIGHTS! Your kid suffers night terrors and wanders around outside? Lock his damn door! Characters in horror movies are usually pretty stupid and don't do what they're supposed to do anyway so you really can't hold that against this movie. The 'pop-up' scares were predictable as well.Even with silly flaws Sinister is successful because it goes back to the basic formula for making a genuine horror movie. Mood and atmosphere are scarier than any cheap CGI monster.",7,0,1,22 October 2012
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," If you got rid of all of the humans it would have been better...
","Let me just start off saying that I loved the first Transformers movie. The action, acting and comedic timing were all perfect. Even the story was good. This is probably why Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen breaks my heart. The 5 stars I give this movie go ONLY towards the Autobots and Decepticons and their amazing fights and action sequences. The real problem with this movie is with the humans. Cut the humans out and you have a good action movie. What's wrong with the humans? Let me count the ways: 1.) Sam's parents (primarily his mother) are so damn annoying. I really was about to shut the movie off when they go to drop Sam off at college. 2.) Speaking of college, what college is Sam going to? 'We're ALL Hot People College?' Where are all the ugly chicks wearing pajamas that were in my classes? Of course I wouldn't mind attending college that had nothing but hot people in it but this college was only one that Michael Bay could dream up. 3.) Sam is an idiot. Who wouldn't want to take their robot car to college? 4.) Megan Fox was...well, Megan Fox. I'm sorry, how did she smuggle a mini Decepticon onto a plane? 5.) Sam's college roommate....omg so annoying and not funny. Even though it was a PG-13 movie, I was BEGGING to see this guy blown away into little fleshy red bits. 6.) John Turturo wasn't funny. 7.) Not humans, but we all could have done without the twin stereotypical racial robots. Overall, Michael Bay tried to do TOO much. He tried too hard to make it funny whereas it just came naturally in the first one. Everything in this movie fails except for the CGI.",5,1,10,14 January 2011
Burlesque," You'd find more enjoyment in watching your dog throw up than this...
","I'm not a musical fan, but I can admit when one is good (Sweeney Todd, Chicago). Burlesque, however, is terrible on all levels: acting, story, characters..name it and this movie sucks at it. I wasn't expecting a stellar performance from Christina Aguilera (I don't even care how to spell her last name) but whatever you want to call it, it was BADDDD. It was probably because her character was so annoying. Really, I hated the main character; just so stupid. Why the hell didn't she just start singing in the first place and make Cher shut the hell up?? Cher's character was a pain in the ass too; just the shut up and listen to someone for s**t's sake. What killed me the most was the WORST romance in a movie I have ever seen. Holy freakin' s*** was the love story so lame. The guy's engaged, then thinks it will be fine to share his apartment with a nice piece of @$$, watches her get changed and perform half naked then 'falls in love with her.' Just so terrible. Oh yeah, then his fiancé walks in on them in bed. HAHAHAA. Worst. Oh, about the music...some of it is good, not going to lie about that. Unfortunately though, it's not enough to save this trainwreck..or Stanley Tucci for that matter. I like Tucci, and it's a shame he's connected to this movie. For better entertainment, I would recommend chewing glass or whatever other horrible thing you can think of doing. Amen.",Null,0,1,26 October 2011
Prometheus," Not perfect but enjoyable...
","Prometheus is probably one of those movies that you would appreciate more after seeing it for a second time. There's a lot to put together and you may miss something the first time you see it. That being said, it's definitely not perfect. Many viewers have complained that not enough questions are answered and there are too many plot holes. I find this forgivable because I think that 'being TOLD' all of the answers takes away a sense of mystery. There is a MYSTERY in Prometheus that the characters are trying to solve. If they don't solve everything, how are they supposed to tell us everything about something they don't find answers for? I rather enjoyed piecing together bits of the puzzle by myself.Prometheus definitely LOOKED fantastic. The set designs were amazing. I wish that there was just a little bit more of a foreboding atmosphere like what Scott created in the original Alien. The acting from the main characters (especially Fassbender)was great, but there were a lot of other characters that you really didn't get to learn/care about especially when they died. I wasn't too thrilled with the ending and thought it was a bit anti-climatic; left a little too open for my taste.Prometheus was fun to watch despite its flaws. It definitely was NOT the worst movie associated with the Alien franchise, but definitely not the best.",7,1,9,18 June 2012
