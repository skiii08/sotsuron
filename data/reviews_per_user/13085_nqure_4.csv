Come and See," Dante's Inferno
","Gripping, harrowing portrayal of Nazi atrocities in Belarus during WW2 - a film full of startling imagery and sound (the buzzing of flies when Alexei returns to his village with Glasha), the sound of German folk music and accordions amidst manic laughter as Nazi soldiers (and their Belarussian collaborators) torch a barn full of desperate villagers.The film's greatest achievement lies in conveying a hellish world with a nightmarish poetic quality (Alexis & Glasha struggling through a marsh bog, dolls lying grotesquely on the floor of a hut as if they have been machine-gunned) but our horror is only intensified by the fact that what we witness - through the eyes of Alexis as he journeys from wide-eyed recruit to a young man aged by what he has seen - actually happened.Too many films take an almost 'pornographic' PlayStation view of war - WW2 was a war waged against civilians and 'Come & See' is a grim, savage as well as truthful account of man's inhumanity to man.",9,8,10,1 March 2007
Training Day," Trite ending mars a film with an interesting theme
","Films about police corruption are commonplace, but it's interesting to watch a film where the police become corrupted as a result of fighting an unwinnable war on the streets (a war that is unwinnable as seen in 'Traffic'), resorting to crooked methods/heavy handed tactics in their war against drugs. I enjoyed the interplay between Alonzo (Washington) and Hoyt (Hawke), their obvious clash of ideals/brutal cynicism and the early scenes are probably the strongest in the film. Hoyt's druggy trip almost reflects the murky, blurred world that he now finds himself inhabiting. The film has two main plotlines (police corruption, & the Russian mafia seeking vengeance) which eventually come together but I feel this is where the film  loses its hold on reality and descends into farce and implausibilty. If only the film perhaps had concentrated on the theme of police corruption, the possible consequences etc. The scenes & dialogue where Alonzo & Hoyt argue their feelings (wolves & sheep) are excellent. On the one hand, we can sympathise somewhat with Alonzo - the ugly war against drugs is stacked in favour of the criminals - yet most of us would probably identify with Hoyt's opinion. It's a morally grey area which should have been examined more.Because the film sadly descends into a simplistic confrontation between good & evil. It is very easy to criticise but I'd preferred a story that made Alonzo examine himself & question what he has become. Instead he becomes a pantomine villain - boo, hiss, he's behind you!The performances were good esp in the beginning where the actors were given the opportunity 'to act' rather than wrestle with each other. Washington is charismatic - I loved his opening gambit where,impatient with Hoyt's talking as he reads his paper, he orders him to 'entertain' him. Some critics have accused Washington of 'hamming' in this role, but I thought he was good as the police officer corrupted by his sense of power. His role, away from his usual type cast, is reminiscent of Richard Gere's impressive turn as a corrupt policeman in 'Internal Affairs' - a film which is much more psychological and the better for it.An interesting premise, but the final twenty minutes disappoint and let's the whole film down.",6,1,12,3 February 2002
Zodiac," Memories of Murder - Squirrels in the Fridge
","Brave attempt - great opening sequence - to depict the fruitless search for an apparent serial killer, detailing the frustration and loose ends faced by the policemen leading the case and the two very different men, from a city newspaper who also pursue the case; a dogged cartoonist who nobody takes seriously at first, the other a maverick journalist whose originality takes him tantalizingly close to finding the killer before he succumbs to alcoholism.Relentlessly downbeat, I think the film does suffer occasionally from too much story in the sense so that you feel detached from the drama of the investigation with information given rather than revealed as part of the journey. The final act does inject more urgency as Graysmith (Gyllenhaal) assumes the search.The film shows that murder investigations are often hampered by simple errors, not by an evil warped genius (Hannibal Lector). For instance, the police interrogate the main suspect but this possibly allowed him time to dispose of any incriminating evidence before a search of his home - as Toschi & Graysmith later surmise.It also deserves plaudits for how the story changes the focus from one main character to another, from Toschi (Ruffalo) in the second Act to Graysmith's pursuit of the truth in the final Act.It also captures a particular period well as well as highlighting how the case did not benefit from police bureaucracy (each police dept possesses evidence that it's reluctant to pass on to the other). With technical developments such as use of computer databases as well as scientific ones such as DNA, modern policemen are better equipped to solve such bizarre, challenging cases as the Zodiac.It would certainly reward a second viewing but it's interesting how Fincher has been regarded as making a 'serial killer' film very much against type (sensationalist 'Silence of the Lambs') and I can't help thinking he was influenced by 'Memories of Murder' a terrific Korean film based on another unsolved true-life series of murders but which is a much more dramatic film, varying in tone from the black to the depressing as well as about two different approaches to solving crime.",7,2,3,22 May 2007
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Clever contrived plot but ultimately shallow
","I didn't catch this at the cinema as I was somewhat put off by the hype and media circus surrounding it. So I was quite pleased to catch it on tv. My word, what a lot of fuss over nothing. Guy Ritchie certainly knows how to devise contrived and clever plots; the ending was a nice homage to 'The Italian Job'.However, that's where all the praise ends. After a bright start, the film eventually descended into a farce with people shouting at each in silly Cockney accents. Perhaps I've missed the punchline or lost my sense of humour but this film was like an adult version of Scooby Doo with its cartoon violence and characterization.Apart from some touches -ie the slow mo's during the card game - this film had a very made for tv feel about it. God help us if Ritchie is the future of British cinema.",1,20,42,30 October 2001
