National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Very entertaining
","OK, to be frank, a lot of the plot may not really make sense, and for the most part, the treasure hunt seems like a bit too smooth a ride for Ben Gates.Yet, for the whole two hours I found myself extremely well entertained. The story is constantly driven forward, and there are no dead moments in the movie. Certainly not a cinematic masterpiece, but I think it's on the same level as an Indie Jones movie. Its purpose is to entertain with action, wit and 'historial facts' that one might wish were true (but of course aren't). And that's what it does. It entertains, and as such, it's definitely fulfilling its promise.I enjoyed it, and Nicolas Cage is well cast as the treasure hunter, while John Voight's and Helen Mirren's appearance is refreshing and makes the movie all the more fun to watch.",7,0,0,11 December 2010
Changeling," Superb!
","I must admit that I didn't know much at all about the plot when I put the DVD in the player, although I was, of course, aware that the film had been nominated for 3 Oscars.So when the story started to unfold, with Christine Collins' son having gone missing, I wasn't sure whether I was going to like the film, simply expecting a drama with a missing boy and a distraught mother looking for him for the next 2 hours or so.That changed the very moment 'her son', who she insists is not her boy, is returned to her. From that moment onwards, I was glued to my seat. A fantastic performance given by Angelina Jolie, and a storyline that any writer would have difficulty to come up with, it's so unbelievable, so chilling, so outrageous. That the script apparently sticks very close to real events definitely works in favour of the film.This is a very powerful piece of art!",10,3,7,16 January 2011
The Orphanage," Had expected more
","What drew me to this movie was the comparison that was made in a newspaper article to 'The Others' starring Nicole Kidman. Having seen that film and absolutely loved it, and being forewarned in the write-up that the viewer could expect even more from 'The Orphanage', my expectations were accordingly high. Too high, perhaps. Granted, it does seem to have all the ingredients of a superb horror-mystery: There is the old house in the remote countryside, with its dark past, there are the strange going-ons that keep the viewer guessing whether there are beings from another dimension at work, or whether it is all in the characters' imagination. There are in fact many parallels to 'The Others'. All in all, however, there was hardly a moment where I felt chained to my seat, scared even to look over my shoulder, like I did when watching 'The Others'. I admit, there were a few scenes that sent a short jolt through my body, but that was about it. I was missing the ongoing tension, the suspense of not knowing what awaited me around the next corner. It all felt a bit predictable to me, a bit flat. All a bit 'been there, done that'. To sum it up, in my view it does not live up to the expectations raised by the comparison made to 'The Others', and it seems to prove how difficult it is to make a horror film that doesn't need special effects and blood, but offers nail-biting suspense from beginning to end. Few movies I have seen over the years were able to provide that, and this is, unfortunately, not one of them.",5,3,5,10 February 2009
Mamma Mia!," A very long wait!
","This film certainly put a smile on my face throughout. It's pure fun to watch. So when I saw it on a recent visit to Europe, I decided to go and see it again back home in Japan, this time together with my wife. But accordingly to the release schedule, that's not gonna happen until late March 2009!!! If anyone should ever wonder why the number of cinema-goers in Japan is dwindling, they would not have to go far to find out. Japan regularly pops up near the end of the list of release dates of international releases, and it's beyond me why. This, however, is outrageous by any standards. People in 50 countries will have been able to enjoy the film - and the ABBA hype will probably have died down - by the time it finally comes to cinemas in Japan 7 months from now! It'll make more sense to get the DVD on a next visit abroad. Then we'll still be able to see it months sooner than we would in cinemas here, albeit on the small screen.",9,1,2,26 August 2008
Taken," Entertaining from beginning to end
","I must say that I'm usually not very much into action movies, and movies where there's too much shooting and violence involved. And yet I thoroughly enjoyed this one, even though it's packed with shooting scenes.Liam Neeson is the best cast I could imagine for this film (apart from Harrison Ford, I suppose), and he's done a brilliant job.One knows, of course, what ending can be expected, but it's the journey that counts. And what a journey it is! If you want to be captured by 90 minutes of entertaining and unrelentless action against the backdrop of Paris, this is the movie to watch.In parts it was reminiscent of a Bond movie or the 'Spooks' series, but then hey, the main character is an ex spy after all, so you would expect him to know all the tricks of the trade, and carry them out 'in style'.Loved it!",10,1,2,5 February 2011
