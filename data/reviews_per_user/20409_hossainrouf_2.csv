Scarface," I always tell the truth...
","This is a great movie. It's highly underrated. It has more memorable scenes and quotes then any other movie I've seen. As for the people that say it has too much profanity, violence, and drug use-it's a gangster movie. What do you expect a fuzzy animals? If that's your attitude maybe you should just watch PBS for a living. It's a great movie-no lie.'Me I always tell the truth. Even when I lie.' - Tony Montana",Null,0,1,23 November 2003
Batman Begins," Batman Never Ends
","Batman Begins is not a bad movie. However, it is far from good. It is a mediocre movie with nothing special. Flaws: The movie feels too long (and I arrived about 5 minutes late to the movie). Batman should not even be in the title. Three fourths of the movie concentrates on Bruce Wayne. The car looks like crap. At least four 4 characters know that Batman is Bruce Wayne. The villains are barely there. There is also a hierarchy of villains. Joe Chill < Carmine Falconi < The Scarecrow < Ras Al Ghul.Pros: The Batman Costume looks great. The Scarecrow parts are great.Overall: People have a bad memory. So go back sixteen years ago and watch Tim Burton's Batman to see what a movie is all about.",5,0,4,22 June 2005
