Requiem for a Dream," Time to wake up.
","If this movie doesn't awaking you, then you have missed the message.  Watch it on a day that you have nothing to do the next day then to sit around and reflect on it, and yourself.  Visual fantastic, wonderful script, and great acting.",10,1,1,23 October 2000
