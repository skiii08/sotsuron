The Lobster," One of the best movie experiences I had in a while
",I recommend seeing this like I did. I had not seen any trailer or heard anything about this movie. My brother recommended it and said I should not look up anything because then I had no expectations and no knowledge of the plot which would make it surreal. The experience was surreal and fantastic. I liked that nothing was explained and I had no idea what was happening. It really gets you to think about relationships and social interactions. I would say I liked the first half better then the second half. The second half I think at times slows down to a halt.,10,1,3,16 November 2017
Vertigo," If you think about it, its a really weird scheme
",I just watched Vertigo and I think its one of the weirdest and most unnecessary complex murder cover up story I have seen in a movie. So many parts can go wrong and It kind of does. And lastly the main character Scottie is kind of creepy and I can not see how two women can love him so.,5,1,5,10 October 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Kind of forgettable
","I remember seeing this and almost directly forgetting it. Its not really bad but not really good either. Its just kind of forgettable. The day after I saw it, I could only remember small things from the movie. It has no impactful moments and the new characters is not that interesting or memorable.",5,0,0,11 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I have mixed feelings for this movie
","I saw this movie on the premier 1999 in Sweden. I was 12 years old. I still remember some of my though during and directly after the movie. 'Yes trade is an important subject and I can see this being a thing that can cause dispute. But either Naboo is very bad diplomatically or the trade federation is very aggressive for it to come to arms'. I did not think JarJar that bad, but I think he made the end battle where he is present rather silly. I remember thinking when the talk about midichlorians turned up that I was an idiot. How could I have missed this. It seemed like a natural thing that they just start talking about which made me think that obvious they must have talked about it in episode 4-6. I did not remember this, which made me an idiot. :P",5,0,1,6 November 2017
It," Its like a 'Stranger Things' movie
",All I could think of when seeing this movie was the series 'Stranger Things'. It feels so much like that series. The best part was the painting. I loved that so much.^^ In general the movie was not that scary and had a bit to much jump scares for my taste. But some of the scares where so great and really mess with you.,6,1,6,18 September 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Not what I expected
","When I saw this movie I had not seen any trailer or heard really anything. All I had seen was the poster for the movie and a rumor that it had to do with the getting the plans of the deathstar which is used in episode 4. I was expecting and really hopping for a Star Wars story that had nothing with the main story. A individual and unique story where all characters where new. But what I got was episode 3.5. It was OK, with many good scenes, but the story felt rushed forward.",6,5,7,13 October 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," It has its moments
",I remember seeing this and its sequel 'worlds end' and thinking these movies would have been better if the stories only had followed Jack Sparrow and removed Turner and Swann. So I did for myself cut where I just removed Turner and Swann and all the scenes that don't makes scene without them and lastly put both dead mans chest and Worlds end into one movie. It kind of worked and was fun to watch.,7,0,0,11 October 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," This movie was something special
","Looking back on this movie, I remember at the cinema when I went and saw it back in 2003 that the introduction of the character Jack Sparrow was the best character introduction I have ever seen and I still think that. Other than that, the movie is solid with a good deal of awesome action and jokes.",9,0,0,11 October 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," It has its moments
",I remember seeing this and its prequel 'dead mans chest' and thinking these movies would have been better if the stories only had followed Jack Sparrow and removed Turner and Swann. So I did for myself cut where I just removed Turner and Swann and all the scenes that don't makes scene without them and lastly put both dead mans chest and Worlds end into one movie.

Interstellar," Awesome!
","I walked into the theadere with no expectations. I had seen no trailers and did not know what the movie was about...and I realy liked it. It stats abit slow,but then Philip Glass like music starts and create a unforgettable atmosphere. The biggest surprise for me was when Matt Deamon turns up, which I liked and acts kind of illogical, but it works. The movie makes you start to question things.",7,0,0,8 July 2018
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Just boring
","I saw this movie at the premier and as it was then, it just was so boring. Not even the end battle was that interesting. I am the kind of viewer where small details can win me over or really annoy me when it comes to movies. This movie has several details that really annoy me. Two times in the film does a person die in another persons arms. In both instances it just such big luck that they survive to just die when the other persons comes to them. Then it happening two times. Its just silly. Then towards the end of the movie when Anakin and Obi-Wan where following Count Doku they get to the platform where he jumped of and just when they both jumped of an enemy ship comes and destroys their ship, killing everyone except Obi- wan and Anakin which jumped of first, where the other did not have time to do this. Anakin and Obi-Wan don't even look back and comment this. Its just a so lucky and strangely convenient thing so that its just them, so they can have a sword battle.",3,0,1,6 November 2017
28 Days Later...," Starts ok, but I dont like where the movie goes.
","It starts with some really good atmospheric shoots with him vandering an empty London. But then when he meets the two survivers they say that the infection has started throughout the whole earth. I immediately question this because when you get infected you turn almost directly. So how are then the infection accidently taken to other partsof the world. The characters later in the movie also question this and it turns out that its only England that is affected.When the Black Girl kills her companion when she suspects he is affected by the look in his eyes, I think that is kind of stupid. She could have just waited a few seconds and she would have known.But the thing that made me dislike the movie was when they meet the military men. All that happens when they are there is boring and stupid. Firstly the men dont act like military men. They dont seem to have any training when they shoot at the zombies and dont act any professional at all. Then they seem to have lost all hope and are whiling to kill each other because of a girl. It has gone like a month since the outbreak. I have a hard time even when it seems to them that society had collapsed that they would act this desperate and strange. One last thing I remembered. When they escape from the city through the tunnel, the zombies follow them. Then they just stop when they are abit far away from them, like they are thinking 'we cannot run to them and catch them, they are driving to fast, lets stop runing'. Smart zombies. :)",4,7,12,15 July 2018
Get Out," I have a hard time buying it.
","Don't get me wrong. I think this movie is good, but when some people in a movie ha some kind of secret scheme I always get stuck thinking of it a lot and I cant see them doing this scheme a lot and get away with it.They seem to take the victims to the same house and have the same names. I cant see the police and family not find them with all the strange disappearances with Rose, which seems to be around the same area. There must be a lot of evidence. For example mobilphones or friends and family knowing that they are going away. You could of course argue that no one has disappeared and they can just say that they have chosen to be where they are. But their shift in personality I think family or others would think that something is wrong.",6,0,1,16 November 2017
Frozen," One of the greatest Disney movies
","When I first saw this movie and Hans was introduced I was thinking it would be so awesome if Hans turns out to be a villain. He has everything to gain from the marriage. Then when Anna names him the leader of the city until Annas return, I was thinking that Hans must be a Villain. Why did not the 'regency council' or whoever which obviously have ruled when the girls where small rule the city. They seems to have done a great job. They should really be against Hans taking control and they must feel that Anna is a bit ungrateful. I though it was awesome when in the end it turned out Hans was the villain. It fit so perfectly.",8,1,2,23 October 2017
A Quiet Place," I did not really like it.
",Seeing this movie I got my thoughts on the movie Signs with Mel Gibson. It also took place on a american farm with hostile aliens/creatures. This movie like Signs had a silly solution to hove to defeat the aliens/creatures which someone MUST have found out earlier when the aliens/creature arived. Other then that it was alot of small things I got irritated on. The family did not seem to have done everything they can to not make sounds. They had alot of wooden floorboards. Then we have the waterfall. Why dont they live there? It seems alot more safe. Come to think about it it seems that the creatures dont care about natural sounds. Is this something that you can simulate? Can you get them to get used to a unnatural sound if you for example put on a loadspeaker with high music or will they always go to that. If they always go for unnatural sounds why not just put on a really load speaker at a few dangorus places and alternate which are playing and let them run around that :),4,7,14,15 May 2018
Unknown," I don't buy the plot
","I just don't buy the things that is happening in the movie. What I mean is that he gets hit in the head and get amnesia, only remembering some things, things so he think he is the character that he is acting. This seems to convenient to me. How can he remember just that. The thing also about that is it seems that they had not played their rolls for that long of a time. All the memories he has to begin with has nothing to do with his 'roll'. That begs the question, what do he remember? He cant remember himself teaching or having any moment at home with his wife because he has never done that in his roll. For that matter the other members of his crew act very strange during all this. They don't contact him or try to explain to him the situation in any way. They even almost hit him with their cat at one moment. They even try to kill him. Then their leader says that he his the person he plays likes that is things that happens. How? He has never really played his roll. Its lucky that they had a reserve for his roll, and that his how I know he never really has played his roll, because no one knows how he looks like.Then we can look at this organizations plan to begin with. They want a scientists research and then kill him so they will be the only ones with it, so they can sell it I think. Why do they need to kill him? He most likely has his research in other locations. If not he is stupid. Anyway it seems important that no one knows that he was the target and his research was stolen. This complex plan comes down to that They know that the scientist never would leave his research and always carries his computer with him. They will then convince him to leave it in the wardrobe. Then they will use some kind of USP WiFi on his computer to steal the research. This part of the plan I think is ridicules and is based on a lot of assumptions which might not work. It is just luck that they succeed with that part and that seems so random when the rest of the very complicated plan(which to me seems you could solve much easier) is so though out.",4,2,2,20 September 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Overall story is interesting, but execution is rather flimsy
","When you start to see this movie you think that the plot seems interesting and that it has potential to be really good. The 'bad guy' seems interesting and has a few new interesting characters and some interesting scenes. But in the end it don't hold up and me at least got bored. Johnny Deep plays a unfunny caricature of Jack Sparrow that never gets funny or does anything really awesome throughout the movie. Barrbarossa is a bit more fun and has some good scenes. The voodoo lady was nice, but then she is only in one scene. I really liked Barbarossas golden ship :)",4,1,3,11 October 2017
Clash of the Titans," Just forgettable
","When it comes to movies for me its always small details that either win me over or make me dislike a movie. This movie is not that interesting and kind of forgettable, but I remember a few details that made me really dislike the movie because it made no sense. The king has no soldiers left to he sends the old and the young on this dangerous mission. But when the city is about to be destroyed you see the king running around with a few soldiers that looks awesome and not old or young, but like regular soldiers. Why did these not go with the others on the mission? Seems like they could have done a lot to help it. But maybe they where not that great because they did not protect the king from getting stabbed. For that matter it is known that the city will be destroyed if not the mission is completed and that the mission will possible, if not probably fail. Why has no one in the city left it? Everyone seems surprised and unprepared when it starts to fall. These where a few details which I really disliked.",4,0,0,20 September 2017
Saw," Im surprised that his plan worked.
","When I saw this movie I stated to realy think about som details in the plot, which made me dont really like it. Its mostly the ending where one of the guys saw of his foot and the other is left to die. But he did not need to do that and the other guy will most likely be found. The excop where chasing the though 'mastermind' in a dangerous car chase to that location. It will have been noticed and the police should find the cars and find the others after that. So when the 'climatic' ending happend I was not movied and just though how unnecessary it was.",4,1,1,1 February 2018
The Da Vinci Code," A bit to much for me
","When I see this type of movies where a big puzzle is being solved with ancient text and so on. I always I always put myself in the shoes of the person/persons doing it in the first place in how they create the hints and create the secret doors that only open in very specific ways. I imagine him having contractors over to do these secret door and try to explain why he needs them. People would think he is a bit weird and if he had done it all himself even more weird and bit trapped in his own world. its like when you see documentary's about ancient secrets they try to unravel by finding clues in old texts. People don't do this, why would they when there exist more easy and more rational ways to do things.",5,1,2,20 September 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Something is missing
","When I see these movies I feel something is missing that where present in the Lord of the Rings movies which made those movies, even though they also had their faults, so much better. The films feel very stressed, like they are rushing through without any pause. There are very few scenes whore the character just sit and talk or walk and talk without anything really happening, where you can learn more about the character and the world. Lord of the rings had a lot of those scenes which I liked. There are instead a lot of extra action scenes thrown in which could work, but I feel it is a bit to much. The atmospheric slower scenes are removed for more action. Then some scenes which could have been really good are just cut short. Like when they are with Beorg or lost in the forest.I think its OK to trow in more characters an focus on Legolas more. I think the best character in the whole movie is the Elf king. I love him so much. But one thing that I strongly dislike is that many of the Dwarfs have very few lines and you don't really get to know them during all 3 movies. I remember the scene towards the end where you say goodbye to all the remaining 10 Dawrfs and I remember thinking: 'who are some of these characters?' I hardly remember who some of them look like or who they where. In that sense I think its to much focus on other aspects around the Dwarfs quest that the quest itself which makes the story feel like its all around the place. But I think there are some really good and strong scenes in this movie, but the movies all and all is missing something.",5,2,2,22 September 2017
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The real villain is someone else
","Seeing this movie and episode 1 & 2 I think the real reason for the Jedi orders fall is Mace Windu. He is such an asshole and hypocrite. He is the reason everything goes bad. He is such an asshole to Anikin. Lets him be in the council but do not get full membership, says the line 'If what you say is true you will have regained my trust'. No other council member seems to really do anything about this. The Jedi deserved it.Also, to bad for Anikin that Obi-Wan is a master of fighting from high ground.",6,2,5,6 November 2017
Back to the Future Part II," Awesome movie but I was thinknig...
","I was thinking... When it comes to the magazine with all the winners... Should it not become obsolete very quickly? Because by just winning, Biff should change the future. Especialy when he wins big as he does and everybody knowing about it. Players might fight more when Biff is not beting on them or fight less when he is and this might affect the outcome. :)",7,0,0,6 June 2018
Honey," Predictable
",After seeing this movie for 5 min I could predict exactly that was going to happen in it and I was completely correct.,3,0,0,6 October 2018
Mad Max: Fury Road," One of the best movie experiences I ever had.
","I went to the movie with some friends. I had not seen any trailers och any reviews of this movie, so I went in with no expectations and no knowledge of it...and it completely blew me away. This is one of the best movie experiences I ever had. It was so good. I will not be able to recreate it again with this movie, you just had to be there at that moment.",10,2,5,19 September 2017
Alien: Covenant," It started out well, but I got bored when a large part of the characters started doing stupid things.
","I am not a big Alien fan, but I had a go watching this. I think it started out well, but I lost intrest and started looking at my phone during the movie( this is something I rarily do. I am easy absorbed into a movie). The turning point for me was when they had landed on the planet and two in theri crew started geting sick. I feel that almost every character in this movie are making stupid decisions and geting themself killed. This include:
-Lets walk around on this new planet which we dont know anything about very uncarefully and smell at strange plants.
-Lets trust this strange robot we found on this planet. Especially when we know he is hidding something and follow him into his basement and look at his large eggs. Also not get suspicus when he cuts his hair so he looks exactly as our own robot.
-Splitt up at the temple when we know that a monster can be out to kill us.
-When we get back to the ship, not quarantine every person that was on that planet and scan them, even though we know that some persons got a alien bursting out of their stomach.",3,86,127,23 January 2018
