Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," quite a film
","I will be one of the first to admit, the critics' (except for Roger Ebert) bashing of this film certainly lowered my expectations before going in. However, I am happy to report that it lived up to my prior expectations. I will also be one of the first to admit, that the film is not flawless.. but then, few are. Here then, are the high and low points of the movie.Great Parts:1) The pod race. An incredible sci-fi version of the Ben-Hur chariot race.2) Acting. especially by Liam Neeson, and Ian McDiarmid, though the rest of the cast was quite good (everyone stop picking on poor Jake Lloyd! The poor kid was just 6 when the filmed this).3) The final sabre duel between Maul, Qui-Gon, and Obi-Wan. I have never seen a duel so amazing in any other movie.4) The most obvious - The effects were astounding5) John Williams's new score, 'Duel of Fates' is wonderful.6) Contrary to popular opinion, I found the plot to be quite interesting and involved. I hear complaints about it being a trade war, and I can't figure it out because the majority of wars fought throughout history have been trade warsNeeds Improvement:1) Use more subtitles rather than having everyone speak some unusually accented version of english.2) Jar Jar. I know the poor guy has gotten a lot of flak, and I can honestly say I found him quite amusing at some parts. However, I don't feel he quite fit into the star wars universe. He was simply too useless to the characters, and too clumsy.3) More screen time for Darth Maul. Again, I know everyone has complained about this, but it's true. A character that great deserves more use. Not even speaking, just seeing more of him would have been nice.4) The new definition of what the force is. I just didn't care for it being changed from something mystical, to something scientific.My four complaints are very, very minor compared to the things I loved about the movie. I've already seen it several times, and will probably see it several more. I urge everyone to do the same.",3,0,1,28 May 1999
The Usual Suspects," * * * * (four stars)
","An absolutely fantastic film. Few films have ever kept me so deeply engrossed as this movie did. Every minute is vital to the film, thus a trip to the restroom during it will leave you utterly lost when you return.Five criminals, Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Hockney (Kevin Pollak), Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), and Verbal (Kevin Spacey) are dragged into a lineup in New York for a hijacking. While in jail, they plan a job together that will get back at the cops. Eventually this leads them out to California, and into the hands of Keyser Soze. A mythical crime lord. The whole movie is told in flashbacks, by Kint. He is the last survivor of the group, and is relating the tale to Special Agent Kujon (Chazz Palminteri).This is a movie that must be watched several times to be fully appreciated. The first time I saw it, I was utterly lost for the first half hour or so of the film. Now, after having seen it several dozen times, I still pick up little things that I've missed. Special mention must be made of Kevin Spacey's unparalleled acting in this movie, which he won a best supporting actor oscar for.* * * * - classic, see it right away",9,0,1,27 January 1999
There's Something About Mary," * * * (three stars)
","One of the absolute funniest movies I have seen in quite a few years. In fact, the only movie I can think of that made me laugh harder was Monty Python and the Holy Grail (which is saying quite a bit considering how many comedies I see).The film is about a rather, to put it bluntly, obsessed guy played by Ben Stiller who thinks about little besides his high school sweetheart (Cameron Diaz) years later. He hires a private investigator (Matt Dillon) to check up on her. The P.I. falls for her and tries to keep Stiller's character, Ted, from going to see her.A couple of warnings in advance about this film. If you find sexual humor of any sort to be offensive, do not see this movie. Also, don't see it on a full stomach because you might lose your last meal from laughing so hard and because of some of the more gruesome sites (Cameron's neighbor... *shudders*)The only complaint I had with the entire movie was the ending, which seemed a like something of a cop out. This is the only reason why it missed a four star rating.* * * - great movie, go see it",5,0,0,20 March 1999
Titanic," In the words of Jay Sherman... it stinks!
","Alright... where to begin. This is.. without a doubt.. the most over hyped movie I have ever seen. All I can figure, is that either the academy is full of teenage girls who swooned over DiCaprio, or James Cameron threatened to smash everyone with his oversized head if they didn't give him all the awards. The characters in this movie were there only to look good and smile broadly whenever the camera focused on them. And as for the award winning effects, they didn't look remotely realistic. They were so obviously computer generated. Shame on the academy for not giving the Oscars to LA Confidential with its vastly superior cast and in depth storyline",1,6,11,31 December 1998
Army of Darkness," * * * (three stars)
","The third movie in the Evil Dead series, Army of Darkness doesn't quite live up to its predecessor, but is a very good movie in its own right. Sucked into the past after the events of the movie, Evil Dead II, Ash finds himself in Arthurian England. In the midst of a war between two kings, Arthus and Henry the Red, Ash is mistaken for one of Henry's vassals by Arthur. He eventually proves that he is not one, and that he has technology superior to either side in the form of his Boom Stick. He then must find the Necronomicon in order to return to his own time. A hilarious movie in many ways, but in no way a horror film, Army of Darkness deviates far from the Evil Dead series. Bruce Campbell does a wonderful job as the ever tortured, and ever egotistical  Ash. The special effects are quite good, except for the matting jobs in some parts... they are the worst I have ever seen.",9,1,1,27 January 1999
The Matrix," * * * * (four stars)
","An awe inspiring film with some of the most unusual imagery I've seen since Dark City. The plot is far more comprehensible than I thought it would be from the looks of the previews.The film revolves around the character known as Neo (Keanu Reeves). A computer programmer / hacker who suspects that something is wrong with the world, and that something has to do with The Matrix. Unfortunately, he has no idea what the matrix is.I really don't want to give away any of the plot beyond this, because the mystery of it is part of the fun. This movie is well thought out, well acted, well directed, and just plain great. It also has quite a bit of humor in it. Mostly in the form of poking fun at cliches.* * * * - Classic, go see it",7,0,0,1 April 1999
Evil Dead II," * * * * (four stars)
","This is, without a doubt, the funniest 'horror movie' I have ever seen. The director, Sam Raimi, has done an incredible job of mixing hilarious comedy and Blood soaked horror together into one great movie.The movie's very inconsequential plot is about Ash (Bruce Campbell) and Linda (Denise Bixler) who go to a remote cabin in the woods. While there, they come across the Necronomicon. Ash plays a tape recording of the book's translations, which awakens an evil spirit in the woods. From here on out, the movie turns into a splatterfest, but a very original one at that. For an incredibly unique horror/comedy, see this as soon as you can.* * * * - classic, see it at once * * * - very good movie * * - okay, hits and misses * - garbage, see only if you have nothing better to do 0 - one of the worst movies of this, or any other year",10,0,0,27 January 1999
