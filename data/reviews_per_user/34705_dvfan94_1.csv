The Expendables 2," Typical Shoot Em Up Done Great
","Went to go watch this with the family and was not disappointed. You don't have to watch the first one because there really is no linear storyline between the first and second movie. *SPOILERS AHEAD* Relatively new actor Liam Hemsworth is really good with the little time he has in the flick. It was a real surprise to me when he died, and was genuinely sad in that moment. Chuck Norris is also hilarious in the few minutes he is in the film. If you like big explosions, this is the movie for you. The movie also gave me a nostalgic feel seeing a lot of the actors I and my parents grew up with. The story is fine. I kinda hoped that Jet Li would get more screen time, but overall it was what the trailers advertise, an old fashioned no holds barred firefight of a movie.",8,1,5,13 September 2012
