Howl's Moving Castle," A big...disappointment.
","Miyazaki, with his breathtaking animation and awesome resume, i thought, would do a great job adapting one of my new favorite novels at the time, Howl's moving Castle.I was wrong. As many have said, if you've seen a lot of Miyazaki's work, this won't impress you much. I left the theater disgusted that i paid ten dollars for this movie.The carefully sculpted plot of the book is ripped away. Replacing it is a mediocre mixture of Mononoke, Spirited away, and a bit of Nausicca. The ending, specifically really stupefied me. I didn't see any morals, or anything i could relate to. The revelation of Howl as a giant bird completely threw me. I seriously caution all DWJ fans to NOT see this movie. If you want to see a good adaption of a book, save yourself some money, and don't go. Only if you want to see a movie that looks like Miyazaki was being completely unoriginal, but with really awesome animation, should you go.",5,4,12,10 June 2005
