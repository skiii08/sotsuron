Antz," Language & Content Not Appropriate For Young Children
","My wife and I were surprised at the language present in this 'family' film. We have noticed that a large number of animated films created by studios other than Disney seem to make liberal use of words which we do not allow our children to use and which we ourselves do not use around children. I was surprised that one scene which appeared in the trailer and made reference to a bug's 'caboose' was an overdub of the word 'anus' which was actually used in the film. Gene Hackman's character used the word 'damn' enough times that both of my children mentioned it to us after viewing the film. It was my wife who first noticed that a lot of non-Disney produced animated films seem to rely on socially accepted vulgarities that I imagine only parents of young children would notice. In particular, the films of Don Bluth fall into this category. If you are offended by adult language and situations, please view this film without your children before taking them so that you can judge for yourselves whether or not the language is appropriate for your own kids.",7,0,0,3 October 1998
