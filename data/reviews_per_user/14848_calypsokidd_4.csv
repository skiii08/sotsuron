Hereditary," Wait for better films...
","Hereditary is the worst film that I have seen in 2018 (I've seen 15 so far). It is a very slow paced film, which isn't a bad thing in itself, but it tries too hard to be weird and creepy and ultimately disappoints with a very lame ending. Not worth the price of admission in my opinion.",3,15,37,9 June 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Once Upon a Time...
","I usually love Quentin Tarantino films and was looking forward to this one...but left the theatre very disappointed. This film drags on and on for over two hours before finally giving the audience one scene at the end that is satisfying. Worse than being boring, the film is immensely bereft of the classic Tarantino dialogue that makes his films so special. In two hours and forty minutes I can only name one scene that was worthy of being repeated. Just a mess of fantasy that is not worth the time devoted to it in my opinion.",5,7,15,30 July 2019
Kong: Skull Island," Best Kong since the original!
","Finally, after being disappointed by film after film after film after film this year we have the only film other than Hidden Figures that has lived up to my expectations. Kong: Skull Island is easily the best film about Kong since the original. The story takes place in 1973 as the Vietnam War is coming to an end which, in my opinion, sets a great atmosphere for what is about to come. The backstory feels a little rushed, especially for a two hour film, but that means we don't have to wait very long for the main character to make his appearance. There are many elements and story lines which mirror the original story while still telling a new one. Visual effects are wonderful, as is the soundtrack. Kong: Skull Island is definitely worth seeing, and even more so if you have the opportunity to see it in IMAX 3D. P.S. Don't forget to stay for the added scene after the final credits.",6,1,5,10 March 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A story worthy of the original three films
","Finally, a film in the Star Wars saga that lives up to the standard set by the original three! Star Wars: The Force Awakens is basically a retelling of Episode IV. The story lines, the characters and their development, even specific scenes and moments parallel it throughout. The opening scene, in which Poe Dameron places information that is vital to the success of the rebels into BB-8 before he is captured by Kylo Ren, mirrors the same opening scene in Star Wars with Princess Leia, R2-D2 and Darth Vader. The similarities continue with Rey, an adolescent unaware of the Force within her and abandoned on a desert planet until a chance meeting with BB-8 sparks her destiny. Sound like anyone we know in Star Wars? Finn, a character with a dubious background, only gets involved in helping the rebel cause for self-centered reasons to start with but grows more altruistic and closer to the cause as the story continues, much like Han Solo in the original tale. Even Han Solo, a character that we are already familiar with, takes on the Obi-Wan Kenobi role in many ways in the new film. I could go on and on but you get the point. New director J.J. Abrams and writer Lawrence Kasdan have re-packaged Episode IV and sold it as Episode VII but they've done it in a way that doesn't leave us feeling cheated, even those of us who were there when the whole Star Wars phenomenon started. The franchise is back on track and is true to the sense and style of the original three films. Can't wait for the next film in 2017!Final note: I just want to say that before seeing this film I correctly predicted that Kylo Ren would be the son of Han Solo and Princess Leia. Feeling pretty proud of myself for getting that right. With that in mind I would just like to go on record with a few more predictions for the upcoming episodes. In Episode VII Luke Skywalker will take on the role that Yoda played in The Empire Strikes Back. Rey will be revealed to be the daughter of Han Solo and Leia (making her Kylo Ren's sister). Also, at some point Finn will end up as captain of the Millennium Falcon. In Episode IX Luke Skywalker dies.",8,6,17,20 December 2015
