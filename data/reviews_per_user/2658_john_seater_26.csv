The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," 2 hours of packaging, 30 minutes of substance, and then some weaknesses
","Somewhere around 45 minutes into this film I noticed I was rather bored. Hardly anything was happening. By the time the movie was over, not much more had happened. I liked the first two installments of the 'Hunger Games' series, so what was the problem here? The problem is very simple. This is a movie that never should have been. The substance should have been condensed into the 30 minutes that it deserves and then used as the opening half hour of the final installment that will be released later this year. If you like the 'Hunger Games' series, you will have to watch this one just so you know the (few) plot developments and meet the new characters. That, I presume, is precisely what the producers wanted: a way to extract more admission ticket money from the audience. Too bad. In doing that, they have reduced the overall value of the series.It's also strange that the production team did not do more with the 2 hours they had. (Slight spoiler follows.) For example, we get endless scenes of Katniss being horrified, shocked, upset, emotionally stressed, outraged, angry, sad, etc., etc. Then near the end we get a mad dash to finish, with the raid on the capital given short shrift and making the file look amateurish. A small bunch of commandos go into the capital but then are let go in so obvious a way that they know they have been let go. Yet everyone is too dumb to try to figure out why the nearly-omnipotent and omniscient President Snow and his baddies let this bunch go. Shades of Star Wars IV. There are other similar kinds of weaknesses in the plot or its development, where something that could have been interesting or useful was ignored for the sake of showing more scenes of Katniss in emotional pain.(Another slight spoiler.) Speaking of the omnipotent/omniscient Snow, that's another irritating aspect of the film. Snow has hidden cameras and spies everywhere and miraculously knows nearly everything going on. Why hasn't he blown the rebel base to smithereens before now? Why does he wait until this movie to do it? Makes no sense. Why does he not send in ground troops to ensure destruction of the rebel base after he has bombed it? Makes no sense. The right way to do would have been for Snow not know where the base was or even that it existed - but then there would have been no excuse for the uninteresting bombing scene with its fake drama of the barely-rescued younger sister and her cat.There's another low-budget element that irks me in a high-budget undertaking such as this. How does the capital city manage to survive while it is bombing into oblivion all the productive cities in its periphery? Where does it get its minerals, silicon chips, food, fuel, plastics, planes, cars, guns, asphalt, cement, cloth, machinery, nail clippers, scissors, kitchen utensils, spices, books, ink, paper, toys, diapers, diaper pins, etc., etc. Does it make them all itself? Do you know any city on Earth that comes even remotely close to being able to do that? Of course not. Shades of the potentially good but ultimately trite film Divergent.Given the high quality of the first two installments in the 'Hunger Games' series, we had good reason to expect another good show this time. Unfortunately, we didn't get it. The acting is good, and the plot does advance a little, so overall I give the film four stars.",4,11,15,2 January 2015
Vertigo," Slow, boring, ridiculous, and predictable
","I finally watched this old chestnut. I read somewhere that it was a flop when it came out but later became recognized as a classic. Apparently Alfred Hitchcock blamed James Stewart's being too old for the part. The two never worked together again. Well, Stewart wasn't the problem. The problem was the script, which is simply asinine. The public was right the first time: the movie is terrible.The hero falls in love with a woman who is supposed to be nuts and who gives him no reason at all to fall in love with her. She has a few mad scenes with him but never engages in any conversation of any substance on any topic, never does any activities with him, etc. On top of that, she is his old friend's wife. Her only attraction is that she is good looking, but lust for a pretty woman isn't love, which is what the hero is supposed to feel. Totally implausible.The movie runs 2 hours. There is a great deal of boring driving around San Francisco and the nearby California coast in the first half of the movie. I started looking at my watch at around 1:15 into the movie. Was this thing ever going to end? At about 1:30 the main plot is revealed. It is pretty silly and quite routine. The remaining 1/2 hour is torture. The plot gets more and more ridiculous, all the while getting more and more predictable. My impatience got more and more intense. When the truly idiotic end finally came, I was both relieved (over at last!) and outraged (what a waste of 2 hours).",1,44,75,18 November 2015
Changeling," The critics are nuts. This film is outstanding.
","When my wife and I first heard that another Eastwood film was coming out, we planned to see it. Then we read unremitting negative comments by the critics, so we hesitated. We decided to see the film anyway because we have liked everything Eastwood has directed, and we knew that some of the cast were fine actors. Wow, are we glad we stuck with our first instinct. The film is excellent.The critics panned the script, by J. Michael Straczynski. One critic mentioned that Straz wrote Babylon 5 and suggested that was reason enough to expect this script to be bad. In fact, Babylon 5 was very good, and so is the script for this movie. Critics complained about Eastwood's directing, but the directing was fine. Some of the critics complained about the acting, but in fact the acting is flawless. My general impression of critics has been strongly reinforced: they typically are shallow and self-important windbags trying to show off how smart and sophisticated they are. They should be ignored.The story itself is sad, uplifting, disturbing, and bittersweet all at the same time. It is, sad to say, a true story.The characters come across as real people, as is typical for Eastwood's films. Every single actor delivers exactly the right performance for the role being played. Indeed, the acting is the best part of this movie, though I do not mean to diminish any other aspect of the film by saying that. There are several children in the film who have significant parts, often with lines that must convey genuine emotions of fear or remorse. Not easy stuff for a kid to get right, yet all of them do their jobs very well. That is partly a tribute to Eastwood's directing, showing his ability to elicit strong performances from his actors.There is no point listing every actor here and praising their performances one by one. They were all outstanding. I will single out Angelina Jolie for special mention, though. She is the main character, and her performance is simply superb. Her range of emotions is truly remarkable. What a fine actress she is.",10,8,11,17 November 2008
It," One of the Losers, big time
","I have not read the book or seen the miniseries, so I am judging this movie on its own merits. It is terrible.The plot is routine and flimsy. The dialog is typical Hollywood garbage. In the first half or so we have a bunch of early teens spewing non-stop ever-so-cool repartee and tediously 'witty' commentary, laced with total disrespect for all adults, who in this movie all deserve disrespect. In the second half, the dialog loses the repartee and wittiness and becomes simply witless. All the teens besides our heroes are incredibly (I use that word deliberately) mean and vicious.There is no suspense in the supposedly suspenseful scenes. There is a lot of action, yet the movie seems to drag virtually all the time to the point of seeming interminable about an hour before the end, which is saying something for a movie that is only a little over 2 hours long.The ending scene is typical feel-good Hollywood silliness with the group bonding and young love sprouting.For the life of me I cannot grasp what the people who like this movie see in it. My advice is to avoid it. It's terrible.",1,0,1,26 November 2017
Lone Survivor," Mildly entertaining action, downright insulting mentally
","I wouldn't bother to review this poor movie except that it has such a high rating on IMDb. I want to help bring that down to where it belongs. I will give it the vote it deserves, not one reduced to offset the ridiculous high score.There's a lot of action. If you are recovering from an operation, as I was, it may provide a nice way to kill some time. If you are looking for a good movie, go elsewhere.The 'Hated It' reviews go into plenty of detail about what is bad, so I will just give a short list: excessive cool talk among the SEALs at the beginning, ridiculous decision to let the shepherd prisoners go free (this all takes place in enemy territory), the commander at the base asking in an irritated tone if there is a problem when the SEAL leader calls the base on a cell phone instead of the radio after missing several scheduled radio contacts, our guys bouncing down two long rock faces and then one small one hitting boulders and trees on the way down while sustaining virtually no damage other than some scrapes, getting shot over and over and over with little ill effect, bad guys who cannot hit the broad side of a barn from the inside with their rifles, bad guys who cannot hit anything with RPG after RPG (except miraculously can put one right into the open rear end of a flying helicopter), our hero performing intermediate surgery on himself at least twice without passing out, the arrival of the cavalry at the end to save our hero.This movie is on a par with the Rambo series, except those made no pretense of being true.",3,0,1,8 March 2016
Star Trek," Some good acting, tiny bit of good writing, idiotic & infuriating plot
","Overall, the film is a disgrace. On its own terms it is routine and dull. As a part of the Star Trek series, it is an awful travesty. In fact, it is not a Star Trek movie. It is a pirate job that uses the Star Trek name and the Star Trek characters and then goes off on a plot that is inconsistent with the plots of the TV shows and older movies that it stole from. On top of that, the plot stinks.The plot is totally routine and predictable. Some crazy Romulan is mad at Spock for having failed, despite Herculean effort, to save Romulus from some implausible disaster. So the nut decides to travel back through time to get even with everybody, even people who had nothing to do with the disaster. Besides being simply stupid and hackneyed, this time travel aspect lets the writers depart from the Star Trek narrative, established through several TV series and several movies, both original and Next Generation. And depart they do, whenever they feel like it. The movie takes place when Kirk is a cadet at Starfleet Academy, so it happens before anything in the TV series or previous movies. But the unimaginative writers couldn't be bothered to work out a plot consistent with the all the rest of the Star Trek collection. Instead, they had to jazz things up by having Vulcan destroyed and Spock's mother killed, thus rendering impossible several episodes in the TV series and the old movies. The writers excuse this travesty by saying that the time thread was disrupted by the nutty Romulans' time travel. Well, isn't that cute? With that logic, they can do just about anything and claim they have produced a Star Trek movie. In fact, that is just what they have done. What they have created is a movie that steals the name and glory of the old shows and then does something not just unrelated but downright contradictory with its forebears.There is some good stuff in the show. The young Spock is very good, very well portrayed by Zachary Quinto. He is the one character in the movie that has real character development. We also get a plausible explanation of McCoy's background, also portrayed by a competent actor, Karl Urban. The rest of the cast is pretty much a blow off. Worst of all, I think, is young Kirk. Yeah, Kirk is supposed to be cocky, but this guy is just a pain in the ass. Chris Pine grossly overplays the cocky part so that he ends up looking like weak slapstick. That may well not be Pine's fault. The director and the writers surely bear at least part and maybe all the blame. The other characters are shallow and not worth the time to discuss.The plot is idiotic. I already explained the hackneyed time travel part. There are quite a few other stupidities, such as the following. There is the miraculous 'red matter,' one drop of which is capable of imploding an entire planet, yet somehow a large glob of it can be carried around in a very small force field in a star ship and then extracted one drop at a time with a hypodermic needle without damaging the ship or even the needle. Come on. The famous episode of Kirk cheating to beat the combat simulation in the Academy is overwritten and overacted so that it is neither plausible nor amusing, just silly. Worst of all, though, is the end of the movie. Remember, Kirk and all these guys are just young'uns at the Academy, not even graduated yet. By a totally stupid plot twist, they end up commanding the flagship of the fleet, the Enterprise, in the battle with the Romulans, even though they're still cadets, not even midshipmen. OK, let's let that pass. Of course, they are so brilliant that they take out the Romulan ship from the future by great derring-do. Idiotic, but we let that pass, too. Then when they get back to Starfleet, guess what? The whole team (except the young Spock, but hold on) is given permanent command of the Enterprise. No, we won't let that pass. I mean, GET REAL!! A bunch of kids commanding the fleet flagship? Yeah, right. Oh, I said Spock wasn't included. That's because at the very end, Spock waltzes on board and informs Kirk that he has noticed that Kirk has not yet chosen a First Officer (yeah, right, a bunch of kids are about to take the fleet flagship out into space without a First Officer), so he asks permission to fill the post. The brat Kirk nods OK, and that's it. Spock gets the job. No need to get approval from Starfleet or anything. The whippersnapper crew goes off merrily into the future, presumably remaining together for at least 20 years on the same ship - as if that ever would happen.This is the kind of light stuff an unimaginative hack writes for 5-year-olds. As a pretender to be the prequel to all the rest of the Star Trek productions, it is trash, nothing but trash.",2,4,7,21 August 2009
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A Star Wars Joke
","1. Predictable, routine action, and far too much of it.2. Incoherent beginning, comprising scenes that flit all over the galaxy.3. Jyn Erso is Galen Erso's daughter. So what? For some reason, Jyn's announcing her lineage is supposed to strike terror, open doors, evoke homage, whatever. Who would care after 15 years, which is how long it has been since she has seen her father? Why does her father write his message to her when he doesn't even know if she is alive and the fate of the galaxy depends on the right people getting his message. How stupid can you get? 4. Routine, predictable political correctness permeates the show - Jyn is a bad ass who beats up most men, the leader of the Alliance is a woman, the main characters are women, Hispanics, blacks, and a mystical Oriental.5. Why does Galen tell Jyn in the opening scene to trust the Force? Neither she nor he has any special connection to the Force. The Force is not strong in either of them. Just routine sloppy writing to force a connection with the Force.6. Why does Jyn's mother leave Jyn, confront the bad guys, and simply get gunned down for her troubles? How could a man as brilliant as her husband have married such a ninny? 7. The plot gets stupider as it progresses, going from silly to ridiculous. A band of rebels steal an Imperial ship (the Empire's people are so utterly incompetent) in one place and then show up at another station on another planet not knowing where to find the Death Star plans, which turn out to be filed along with the Empire's routine documents including the Emperor's favorite recipes with no special security. Knowing nothing, our heroes almost effortlessly figure it all out, retrieve the plans, and transmit them. In the meantime, the Alliance, roused by our heroes' pluck, attacks the Imperial base to draw attention away from our heroes (isn't that a rather tired plot line?) and have great success doing it even though they made no prior plans and didn't even decide to do it until the spur of the last moment. Yet they carry it off brilliantly. The battle scenes often seem to have been lifted straight from previous Star Wars movies - 'Copy that, Gold Leader,' flaming X-wings steered by screaming pilots, 'I'm on him, Blue Leader,' etc., etc.8. No character development. Who cares about these people? Who could?",3,15,31,21 December 2016
Spotlight," An outstanding movie
","This movie is outstanding. Everything about it is good. I saw it a second time just 48 hours after seeing it the first time. I'm not sure I ever have done that before. I easily could sit through it again, only 24 hours after having seen it the second time.I was a little concerned that it would be a routine Hollywood left-wing bash of the Catholic Church, but instead it was very well written and presented. Nothing excessive, overdone, or overstated. Nothing understated or whitewashed, either. The two writers have a clear understanding of how Catholics view the clergy and why this scandal was devastating for so many of them. The movie illustrates the difference between the Catholic faith and the Catholic Church.The acting is excellent. Not one weak performance. I had the feeling that these were people I might know, very real people.This movie is one that anyone might find interesting. Those raised as Catholics are likely to find it so and should see it.",10,0,1,28 December 2015
American Sniper," Apolitical review of an apolitical movie
","American Sniper is about part of the life of Chris Kyle, who was a sniper in the US military in Iraq. Kyle served four tours of duty in Iraq. In his capacity as a sniper and soldier (actually a SEAL), he killed a lot of people. The movie sketches his background and the events that led him to enlist in the Navy, become a SEAL, and then become a sniper. The movie presents his thoughts, internal conflicts, and difficulties dealing with the stresses of war in general and his experiences in particular. THAT'S IT.I gave the movie 7 stars because of my internal rating system. Eight or more stars is a movie I would want to see at least one more time. American Sniper isn't that kind of movie for me, though it may be for others. I saw it once, am glad I did, and am satisfied. I can easily see why someone who has a closer connection to the movie (e.g., a veteran of the war in Iraq) might want to see this movie more than once. For that person, the movie easily could be an 8 or higher.The acting and direction are excellent.The movie is about Kyle, not American foreign policy, patriotism, or even heroism. The movie takes no stand on whether the Iraq war was good or bad. It does not present Kyle as a hero but rather as a man who did his job well. If you want to see a movie about a man's participation in a twilight war against irregular fighters and terrorists and the effect that the war had on him, see this movie. Otherwise, skip it.Now for a brief remark on the large number of reviews that paint this movies as either patriotic or routine propaganda. UTTER NONSENSE. Ignore all reviews that give the movie high marks or low marks because of the political preferences of the reviewer. The movie takes no stand on the desirability of the Iraq war, on how it was conducted, on American foreign policy, or any other political issue. The movie is completely apolitical. Some of the characters have doubts about what their side is doing. The main character himself has thoughts about what he is doing. At one point, he is quite ready to shoot a kid who has picked up an RPG and is trying to aim it at some US soldiers. While holding a bead on the kid, he keeps hoping the kid will drop the RPG. When the kid does just that, the main character is relieved. Not quite what some reviews would have you believe about what the movie does or what Kyle himself thought. The movie is about Chris Kyle, so of course it shows us his thoughts about the war and his role in it. Chris Kyle is patriotic. Chris Kyle joined the Navy in part because of 9/11. Chris Kyle has no regrets for the job he did. Those are CHRIS KYLE's thoughts, not abstract statements about the desirability of American involvement in Iraq. Also, 9/11 really did happen, the enemy in Iraq really did use children and women as means to kill American and other foreign soldiers, many of the enemy were vicious people who murdered and tortured their opponents. The movie shows all that. It was part of the reality that framed Kyle's life. Nonetheless, the movie takes no stand on whether the US should have been in Iraq. The movie is about one man and his view of the world he was in and what he did in it. It is neither patriotic nor propaganda.Some negative reviews complain that the movie glorifies 'a killer.' That is particularly offensive nonsense. Consider the following set of situations. (1) A soldier is sent to Iraq. He sees an enemy. He shoots the enemy before the enemy shoots him. Is the soldier a killer? If you say yes, then you are a fool, and we can stop here because you are beyond reason. If you say no, let's go on. (2) The same situation except the solider does not see the enemy. However, the soldier's buddy does see the enemy and shoots him. Is the soldier's buddy a killer? After all, the enemy wasn't aiming at the soldier's buddy. Repeat the answers to situation 1. (3) Same situation, except that now the soldier's buddy is posted on a rooftop looking for enemies so he can shoot them before they shoot the solider. The guy on the rooftop is called a sniper. He is good at his job and kills many enemy who are trying to bomb or shoot his comrade. Is he a killer? Repeat the answers to situation 1. In all the foregoing situations, the soldiers are doing their job and trying not to get killed doing it. That is what soldiers do. They are not killers for doing it. The people who sent them into combat may be evil, stupid, misinformed, or lots of other bad things, but the soldiers are just doing their job. This movie is about a soldier doing his job.War is hell. It's not always clear that a war should be fought. Sometimes it is clear that it shouldn't have been. None of that is the fault or even the concern of the soldiers who fight those wars. They are just doing their job. This movie is about one of them. Leave your political baggage behind when you see this movie, and judge it for what it is.",7,6,21,22 January 2015
The Revenant," Routine plot, average acting, bad cinematography, historically inaccurate
","The plot is a routine revenge story. A guy gets mistreated. His son is murdered. He overcomes obstacles and gets even. Yawn.A routine plot is turned into a ridiculous one by the small events throughout. The movie opens with a bunch of hunters wading through the Everglades, except that it is somewhere in the northern Rocky Mountains. Or at least is supposed to be, though I don't know where one would find Everglades-like water amongst the pine trees anywhere in the Rockies (where I have done extensive backpacking). This fascination with people wading or swimming in frigid mountain water in winter pervades the movie, showing up again and again. I've waded in that water. It is COLD. My wife used to call it 'screaming cold.' Yet in this movie people flop into the water, get completely soaked, and then just walk away as if nothing happened. In reality they would very shortly freeze to death and become encased in ice. Floating down the river while fully clothed, including being wrapped in a bear skin as in one scene, would drown you in no time.The scene shifts back and forth between the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains. Start in the mountains, move to the plains, go back into the mountains (why?), back to the plains.The acting is competent but nothing special. DeCaprio's acting mostly consists of grunts because after the bear mauling he cannot talk right until near the end of the movie. I can do that. Do I get an Oscar? Over and over we are treated to interruptions of the action for scenes of nature, especially views of the tops of trees from the bases of those trees. Is that supposed to mean something? It interrupts the story for no obvious reason.There are these Indians around, looking for our hero and his friends to attack them. The Indians are 'Rees,' i.e., Arikaree or Arikara. The problem is that those Indians lived in North Dakota, not in the Rocky Mountains and certainly nowhere near the Yellowstone.This show is just another ho-hum Hollywood mangling of history. The characters are uninteresting and flat. The acting does nothing to make the characters more than that. The plot is predictable except where it is so silly as to be hard to imagine. Overall the show is mildly entertaining if you are bored and don't have anything else to occupy your time.",3,9,18,15 January 2016
Jarhead," Boring, slow, routine anti-US military trash
","The people who produced this piece of junk apparently saw themselves as the successors of the line of movies made 30 or 40 years ago that were intent on showing the US military in Vietnam to be a bunch of worthless bloodthirsty losers. See Platoon for an example. This show has the same overall plot, just moved up in time to the first war in Iraq.There is no one in this movie that has any desirable qualities. The commanders are idiots. The NCOs are callous. The men are deranged. The wives send them home videos of themselves getting laid by their neighbors back home, and their girlfriends cheat on them and abandon them. Nobody, literally nobody, is worth a damn.OK, so the individuals are no good. What about the military itself? A bunch of incompetent fools who don't fight well, don't use their equipment properly, and who are disgusting boors.Negative ratings are not allowed. Even a zero is not allowed. So I have to give it a 1.",1,9,16,8 March 2016
Gone Girl," Initial routine plot descends to simple stupidity
","I am surprised that this movie gets more than 5 stars on average and am simply amazed that it gets over 8 stars total. It is a stupid movie with merely competent acting, silly direction, and abominable writing that includes a routine plot and truly obnoxious dialog.I won't bother going into all the details about why the plot is so bad. Other reviewers already have done that very well. I will just summarize the main points. Worthless, unappealing guy meets overbearing, unappealing bitch at party. They get married. Because of who they are, the marriage fails. He cheats, she schemes. Somewhere around the middle almost all doubt about what is going on has already become obvious, but just in case you didn't figure it out on your own, the movie spills the beans. It's all old stuff, seen many times in low-budget TV shows over the decades. The rest of the movie is an exercise in coming up with a slightly different ending. The chosen ending is simply idiotic. To get there, the plot cannot avoid a large number of holes big enough to drive a truck through. The ending is the most preposterous part of the whole story. After one faked homicide is followed by a real homicide committed by the person who faked the first one, the cops just drop the whole thing, and Mr. & Mrs. Wrong are reunited to live unhappily ever after.And the dialog! No wonder Mr. and Mrs. Wrong don't get along. They are too busy engaging in preposterously clever and cool dialog with each other to ever have a real conversation.The characters are all cardboard cutouts with no life and no depth. None of them is anyone I would care to know or would care about.Terrible movie. The only reason to see it is to marvel at the bad taste of so many reviewers.",2,10,16,22 January 2015
Gran Torino," Real people in the real world
","My wife and I recently saw Gran Torino for the second time. That alone should tell you we liked it, and it was even better the second time. The movie shares quality with all the other movies that Eastwood has directed: the characters are very real. Nobody is perfectly good, nobody is purely evil. Rarely is anybody drop-dead gorgeous. Most of the characters are quite ordinary people, just trying to get along in life. The people look and act like real people, like people you could expect to run into on the street.These real people are put into a story that has two intertwined plots. First, there is Kowalski, played by Eastwood. He is an old fellow whose wife has just died and who is bothered by memories of his military service in Korea, service that he is proud of but nonetheless troubled by. Second, there are the Hmong immigrants and their difficulties of assimilating into American society. Anyone with a family of recent immigrant origin will understand their situation. Kowalski interacts with the Hmong, each learning something from the other. It could be sappy and maudlin, but it most definitely isn't. It is very well done.The movie overall is a serious undertaking, but it also has a lot of Eastwood's characteristic humor. I nearly split my sides during the scene when Kowalski tries to teach the Hmong kid how to talk like a working class American, even the second time I saw the movie and knew what was coming. The lingo and mannerisms were right on the mark. The banter between the Polish Kowalski and his Italian barber was another gem. The scenes of Kowalski interacting with his parish priest also are very good. As a descendant of Italian immigrants who told stories of their rivalry with the Poles living in the neighboring development in Aliquippa, PA, I can say confidently that those parts of the dialog are accurate and genuine.As usual with Eastwood's films, Gran Torino opens a window on an aspect of real life and gives it a thoroughly credible and realistic treatment. I already have watched the movie twice. I expect to buy the DVD at some point and watch it some more. What better recommendation could I give?",10,1,8,25 July 2009
The Hurt Locker," Garbage from beginning to end
","Terrible movie. Essentially a Middle Eastern War Movie on the level of the Dirty Harry series but pretending to depict reality.The hero is an unlikable rogue member of an Army bomb unit in Iraq. He does nothing by the book. His team members don't trust him. It turns out they have good reason because later he takes them on a wild goose chase and gets one of them seriously wounded and almost captured.In the middle of the show, we have a long sniper vs. sniper scene, in which the bomb squad is out in the desert disposing of collected IUDs and meets up with some Britishers. They come under fire of some Arab snipers who knock off two of the Britishers. Our heroes have their own telescopic rifle and spotting scope. They casually become snipers themselves and engage the bad guys. Both sets of snipers are really good - a bunch of untrained rag heads and a couple of bomb squad guys. No sniper training in either group. Being a sniper is really easy, right? Just pick up a rifle with a telescope and you can hit anything without knowing anything about adjusting for distance and wind. But what is this scene doing in this movie, which is about the bomb squad's exploits in defusing bombs? I guess the script writers needed some filler.The bomb defusing scenes are mildly interesting, which is why I gave this show a rating of 2 instead of 1.",2,2,4,8 March 2016
Jurassic World," Seen one, seen them all
","Let's start right off with the spoiler: There is a dinosaur park on an island, the containment system breaks down, dinosaurs get out, people get eaten (including some bad guys). Wait. Didn't I just describe the original Jurassic Park and more or less all the others? Yup, sure did. There is nothing, NOTHING, original in this film except a few negligible tweaks on previous Jurassic plots.What sets this one apart is the new low in the dialog and the acting. The dialog is idiotic beyond description. Routine, silly, predictable, overdone, ... Wait. I'm giving it too much credit because I said beyond description, so let's leave it at that: beyond description. The acting ranges from nothing special to terrible. The prize for most terrible goes to Bryce Dallas Howard, who cannot act to save her life. She seems to think that routine swagger and pre-teen gestures convey character and emotion. She cannot even pronounce standard English: 'Walcome to Jurassic World,' 'year over year ravenue continues to build,' 'higher than aver,' 'our DNA axcavators discover new species avery year,' 'learned more from genatics in the past dacade than a santury of digging up bones,' 'the Indominus rax,' just to take examples from the first 10 minutes of her appearance on screen.Despite all its flaws, the movie provides an amusing diversion if you are tired and just want to park yourself in front of the tube or your monitor and be entertained by brainless, predictable action. That's why I gave it 2 stars instead of just 1.",2,1,4,21 June 2015
Don't Breathe," Don't bother
","An excessively positive description of the plot would be routine, boring, and improbable. A more balanced description would add that it is stupid, idiotic, moronic, and imbecilic. Over and over the heroes, who really are scum, never get the idea to distract the blind guy by throwing something to the other side of the room. It never occurs to them to smash out a window and escape through it. It never occurs to them to trip the guy. It never occurs to them to pick up things to use as weapons, even though appropriate objects are lying all over the place and indeed are picked up by the blind guy. Near the end, how does the blind guy run way down the street straight for his victim? Is he really Batman, able to echo-locate? Especially after one of the scum/heroes has bashed his head repeatedly with a 2-pound maul. When the police come near the end, wouldn't they have been a mite curious about the basement prison cell the blind guy had constructed?The photography is truly terrible. Most of the time you can't see what is going on because the action mostly takes place in the dark. Oddly, the blind guy has enough dim lights on so that you can see people moving around but not enough to see anything clearly. Later, the blind guy turns off the lights, but why did he have them on in the first place? He's blind, so why spend the money on the electricity? Why does this routine 1920s-style small house have so many strange shafts, both vertical and horizontal? How did the blind guy kidnap the young woman who killed his daughter? How did he get all those mattresses and bondage equipment to build the cell? How did the blind guy get rid of the dead girl's body? There was a scene that I think depicted that, but like most of the movie, it was too dark to figure out what he was doing.Why not bash the dog's head in with a chair or frying pan or something?Why spend any more time on this worthless waste of time?",1,90,179,7 September 2016
Sicario," Proof that IMDb ratings mean little
","How this movie got a rating of 8.1 baffles me. The plot is idiotic, the filming is terrible, the characters are shallow, the acting is wooden, and the whole thing is predictable and boring, and it even tries to be routinely preachy near the end. A rating of 8 or more is rare on IMDb, so one would expect an outstanding show. This show is garbage. I seriously considered giving it a 1 instead of a 2 just to help offset the grossly misleading 8.1, but I decided in the end to give it the rating I thought it deserved, which is a 2 rather than a 1 because it does convey some idea of the violence of the Mexican drug wars and the viciousness of the drug lords.The main character is Kate, an FBI agent who is good at what she does and so is recruited to join a special anti-drug unit. Kate is very idealistic, whereas the anti-drug unit does what it has to do. The point of the movie is to show the conflict Kate goes through in trying to reconcile her idealism with the violent reality of the anti-drug unit. The first third or so of the movie comprises close-ups of Kate's face as she takes in and tries to digest what she sees. We have Kate in profile, Kate in full frontal view, Kate in 3/4 profile, over and over and over. Emily Blunt, who portrays Kate, acts like a block of wood, so the close-ups completely fail to convey any emotion or any real feel of Kate's thoughts and emotions. The rest of the movie continues in the same vein but without so many close-ups of Kate's face.The last third of the movie (3 scenes: the tunnel, the assassination, and the final scene) are shot in the dark so that the viewer cannot see what is going on most of the time. The most ludicrous passage in the entire movie occurs during the assassination scene, when the bad guy (a drug lord) tells the good guy (the US agent who is sort of a bad guy, too) that the people he works for (the US government) are no better than the drug lords. About the violence the drug lords perpetrate, he asks, 'Who did we learn it from?' Ah, yes. Another Hollywood statement that beneath it all, the US is to blame for yet another world problem. Apparently the US taught the drug lords to cut off people's heads, throw live people vats of acid, and so on. Happens all the time in the US, right?Other reviewers in the 'Hated It' category have a done a good job of detailing the various idiocies of the plot, so I won't repeat them. Just take it from me that everything bad they say about the movie is true.This movie pretends to be one of gritty realism. It is really just trash in every regard.",2,23,48,25 October 2015
Zero Dark Thirty," Many things wrong, nonetheless adequately entertaining
","This movie is about the hunt for Osama bin Laden. It tells the official story adequately, though it overlays the story with trite political correctness. We have learned from Seymour Hersh that the official story probably is a lie, but that was not known when the movie was made.There are two major problems with the movie. First, it is much too long. It should be 30 or even 45 minutes shorter. It drags a lot. Second, the heroine is not believable. She is recruited into the CIA out of high school (ridiculous right there) and spends the next 10 years of her career trying to track bin Laden. She finds him! She, her limited range of experience, knows better than everyone else who is telling the truth and who isn't and what leads to follow. She has so much pluck that she yells at her superiors and gets away with it. Everyone is in awe of her. Come on. What's with Hollywood? The script writers seem to be lost in the 1960s mindset that young people are smarter, more knowledgeable, and wiser than their elders. They are the only ones who really know what is going on. And of course nowadays they often are women. At least they didn't make this one Hispanic (there are no other ethnic groups in the US, you know).Despite the foregoing criticisms and others well explained by many negative reviewers, I found the show engaging and enjoyed watching it. The general story of how the CIA found bin Laden is interesting. Though it's not fully accurate (see Seymour Hersh, London Review of Books, 21 May 2015, for an alternate account with much supporting evidence), it is accurate enough to be interesting.",5,0,2,8 March 2016
The Big Short," Well done, grossly misrepresents the real causes of the collapse
","This movie is very entertaining. It does a good job of explaining some rather abstruse financial instruments. Overall it is informative. Unfortunately, it also is grossly misleading about what really caused the housing bust in 2007 and the financial turmoil of 2008. Both were almost entirely the result of misguided federal policies that accumulated over several decades and that reinforced each other. The movie, in contrast, makes it seem as if the only important cause was greed by the financial institutions.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which exist because of federal policy, funneled excessive funds into housing. They did it in response to federal policies of the 1990s that pushed or even required lower lending standards. They also did it to curry favor with Congress after they were found to have been lying in their accounting in the early 2000s. The Fed kept interest rates abnormally low, making loans cheap to take out. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1992 reduced taxes on capital gains on houses, making houses more attractive investments, thus stoking demand still more. Federal law makes mortgage loans no-recourse, encouraging speculation. The SEC required big financial institutions to get bond ratings from only those ratings agencies approved by the SEC. That was bad enough because it prevented competition through entry, but the SEC's attention wandered and it allowed the original 7 approved agencies to dwindle to 3 by 2007 because of closures and mergers, further eliminating competition. The Community Reinvestment Act required financial institutions to make unsound loans. The SEC did not bother to investigate the new financial instruments (well-described in the movie) to see if they were sound. Eliot Spitzer (at last a non-federal player), using his office as Attorney General of New York as a springboard for the governorship of that state with his eye on an eventual run for the US presidency, abused his office to abuse financial institutions, leading directly to the destruction of the big financial institutions' research departments. Research personnel in 2007 were half what they had been in 2000, directly the result of Spitzer's shenanigans. There's more, but that's already perhaps too much.The Big Short gets *NONE* of that right, except for a slight mention that the SEC fell down on its job. That's because The Big Short completely ignores all of it to push the easy but misleading drama of corporate greed.The Big Short also misrepresents the housing collapse of 2007, presenting it as largely driven by sub-prime mortgages. In fact, default rates for prime mortgages were just as bad.As of this writing, The Big Short is a leading contender for a Best Picture Oscar, largely because it portrays an event of considerable national importance. It doesn't deserve the award on those grounds (though it is in fact a fine movie) because it grossly misstates what happened and thus lays the foundation for subsequent bad public policy to fix the problem. That's why I give it an 8 rather than a 10.The acting was very good throughout. Everyone is making a big to-do about Christian Bale's performance. It was OK but nothing special. I though Steve Carell turned in the best performance and deserved a nomination.Oh, by the way, about that nasty Chinese guy in the movie who explains CDOs and CDOSquareds and who obviously was behaving in bad faith. He was real, and he was found guilty of gross professional misconduct, barred from working in the financial industry, and given a big fine. His company had to pay a separate big fine. He didn't go to jail, but at least he won't be deceiving the public again.",8,2,3,24 February 2016
Wonder Woman," Gal Gadot Ten, Script Writers Zero
","I was very disappointed with this movie. The preview clips gave the impression it would be a lot of fun. Unfortunately it is so badly and routinely written that it wasn't much fun. That's too bad because Gal Gadot does a great job as Wonder Woman. Chris Pine is good, too, in his supporting role, but it is Gadot who carries the film and prevents it from being a total flop.The main problem with the writing is that there is no tension, no suspense, no real surprise anywhere. Wonder Woman uses all her powers early in the show, so the rest of the action becomes predictable. It also becomes clear early on that Wonder Woman is invincible, so there you never are sitting on the edge of your chair wondering what is going to happen next. The bad guys are the World War I Germans, and they are all really bad, out-of-historical-context proto-Nazis. The result is just another trumped up routine superhero action flick. Who cares? Well, I wouldn't care if it weren't for Gal Gadot. She's terrific as Wonder Woman. She has the right combination of humor, sweet simplicity, and bad ass attitude to pull off the role. She seems to have real talent as an actress. I hope to see more performances by her in productions that are worthy of her skills.",5,3,10,25 June 2017
Fifty Shades of Grey," Fifty shades of trash
","The plot is idiotic. An intelligent well educated college senior interview a handsome rich guy and falls for him. He is a nut case who does 'not make love. {He} f*cks, hard.' He also is a sadist. He won't let his women touch him. OK, maybe our co-ed likes that. Except that she is a virgin until she sleeps with this guy. She also has nothing in common with him. She is a romantic, he isn't. She likes to do things together, he doesn't. The two of them don't do anything together except have sex, don't talk about anything except how screwed up he is. What a deep and exciting relationship. Just the kind of guy an intelligent well-educated college senior would fall in love with. You betcha.Our guy also has built some gigantic business empire even though he is only in his twenties. Recent examples of that are quite rare and involve people who produced new things, such as Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. Not our guy. He says that business is based on knowing people, and he knows people. Apparently my more than 30 years of teaching in a business school was all misguided. I was under the impression, and taught others, that entrepreneurship, inventiveness, management skills, finance, risk assessment, and productivity were among the important things that determined business success. All irrelevant as long as you know people, it seems. The usual Hollywood stupidity about what business is, what business does, and how business works.Our guy is more than just a business whiz. He has done it while overcoming a crack-head mother and an abusive childhood. He also plays classical piano brilliantly. He flies a helicopter and also glider planes. He's tough as nails in his business dealings, but under it all he has a heart of gold, giving tons of money to noble charities. One hackneyed angle after another.Now about the sex scenes. Plenty of nudity and some SM. When you strip out the Hollywood crap and phony baloney garbage, what you have is the core of the movie - simple SM pornography, though actually not much of it. What's this junk doing getting ratings on IMDb? Does IMDb also rate stag films and Hollywood starlets' sex tapes? If it rates this pile of dung, why not those, or to turn that around, if not those, then why this?The ending isn't really an ending. It leaves the relationship between our hero (?) and heroine (?) hanging and is an obvious come-on for a sequel, of which I understand there are to be two. The development of those is obvious from the story line in this one. The basic line will be that our hero will be tormented by his love for our heroine, and in the end she will re-make him and save him from himself. An SM-porn version of Pretty Woman, I guess, stretched out into three installments. Sounds awful. This one sure was.",1,3,5,19 March 2016
Godzilla," Incredibly bad
","Idiotic plot, if you can call this drivel a plot; uninteresting characters; predictable action; terrible camera work; tedious background music; low-grade CGI; shallow acting; routine plot gimmicks. Did I miss anything? If so, it was terrible, whatever it was. Everything was terrible.The initial story is ridiculous but is the kind of thing you can forgive in an action/sci-fi movie. After that, the movie goes downhill, and keeps going down and down and down as the movie progresses. The main plot lines are routine, tedious, and boring.The movie is really just an action flick, not intended to have a real plot or any character development. That might OK, but even an action film has to have a semi-coherent plot to be any fun to watch. This movie's plot is, as I said above, idiotic, making the action scenes mostly unexciting and uninteresting. It also might be OK if you could actually see the action, but much of the time you can't. Most of the action takes place at night in scenes so dimly lit that you can't see what is going on.This film has no - repeat, NO - redeeming features. Don't waste your time.",1,12,27,19 May 2014
Life," Insultingly stupid variation of Alien
","A good sci-fi movie generally must violate some law of nature but, having done that, presents an internally consistent plot. This catastrophe violates virtually every law of nature that pertains to it and then imposes a ridiculous plot.I had a list of some of the things that most bothered me. However, previous reviewers already have covered most of them, so I won't repeat them here. I only insist on dwelling on the utter implausibility of the alien itself. It starts as a single cell that can perform all the functions of a multi-cellular organism: nervous, muscular, endocrine, mobility, intelligence, learning, you name it, this single cell can do it all. Totally ridiculous. The cell multiplies, and the mass of cells aggregate into a larger being. (That actually is believable and happens here on Earth with organisms such as cellular slime molds). Despite having been asleep for millions and perhaps billions of years, the alien quickly figures out how to use a human tool (it has not met humans or their tools before) to free itself from the observation box it is in (it has not met observation boxes before), and then it figures out how to get out of the lab (it has not met human labs or habitats before), which the crew was too stupid to seal until it was too late. What a remarkable beast! Later when it is outside the space station on one of the crew members and the crew member pushes herself away from the space station hoping to take the alien with her into deep space, the alien outsmarts her by jumping back onto the space station. Go figure: the alien eats living creatures, the crew member is alive and the alien knows it, the crew member is warm, the outside of the space station is extremely cold (temperature in outer space is about 2.5K, or about -455F), yet the alien knows it should abandon a piece of food and jump onto an inorganic extremely cold metal object. Right. Still later, the alien gets inside an escape pod and fights with the crew member who is trying to override the pre-programmed autopilot sequence to take the pod safely back to Earth. The crew member wants to take the pod into deep space. Somehow, the alien (who has not met an escape pod before) knows it should battle the crew member so that the autopilot (the alien has not met a human computer or an autopilot before) can land the pod safely on Earth. Really believable, right? In fact, how does the alien even know that Earth is there? It arrived on the space station in a frozen soil sample from Mars.The foregoing are only a few of the utter idiocies of this film. Other reviewers have done a good job listing and explaining most of the others.This movie is an unimaginative, unintelligent variation on Alien that offers nothing new except for its depth of stupidity.",1,32,63,24 April 2017
300," Trash in every way
","Unexciting action, terrible direction, and tedious pomposity, all wrapped up in a confused mess of mangled history, Star Wars, and Lord of the Rings.First big scene: Young Leonidas gets sent out to the mountains to prove himself. A heavy snow is falling (remember, this is southern Greece) on this lad dressed only in a loin-cloth. A wolf shows up. Horrors! Except it isn't a wolf, but rather some kind of mythical caricature with a weirdly shaped body, ridiculous teeth, and of course drool cascading from its mouth. Leonidas dispatches the beast with his lance.Next big scene: A Persian emissary shows up to try to talk Sparta into surrendering to Xerxes. Leonidas and the Spartans push the emissary into monstrous vertical pit right in the center of town. Despite being in the very middle of town, it had no guard wall to keep people from toppling into it. Yeah, that's realistic. Is there a Balrog down there?Next big scene: Leonidas scales a nearly vertical mountain in sandals to consult the oracle, who is tended by a bunch of deformed old men that apparently are Siths, for they look like The Emperor in Star Wars VI. The oracle is a hot chic in diaphanous garments that might as well not be there. That is the first gratuitous nudity scene, obligatory in movies nowadays but usually better done than this pointless display. The oracle tells Leonidas not to go to war.Next big scene: Leonidas is in bed with his gorgeous wife, Gorgo, discussing whether to go to war. We get a totally gratuitous exhibition of Gorgo's breasts, followed by a semi-pornographic depiction of her and Leonidas making love. Totally pointless, adding nothing to the plot.At this point, it starts to run together in my mind, but eventually we get to the battle scenes, which are grotesquely overdone. Every Greek is able to dispatch one after another after another of the incompetent Persian soldiers with a quick spear thrust or a sword slash. Every thrust and slash is accompanied by huge spurts of blood. Frequently the action is suddenly changed from normal photography to irritating and counter-effective stop-motion. The director apparently is in love with that technique, for he uses it over and over. Its main effect is annoyance. Oh, I forgot to mention that all the Spartans are dressed in breechclouts. Shows off the muscles but doesn't do a lot to protect against enemy blows.The human combat scenes are bad enough, but then we get some Lord of the Rings stuff, transforming the battle scenes from merely insipid to downright idiotic. First, there is the Cave Troll. He is some giant creature who looks sort of like an overgrown human but with a mouth full of teeth and unable to speak any language. The Persians bring him up to the battle in chains and then turn him loose on the Spartans. Some Spartan does him in with an arrow or lance to the eye. Mines of Moria, anyone? Later, the Persians bring up a troop of Oliphants, er, elephants, which turn out to be ineffective in combat because they merely fall off the cliff at the edge of the trail. After that, the Persians bring up a gigantic rhinoceros, all fitted out with armor. This beast is bigger than any two real rhinos. It comes charging at the Spartans. Some cool Spartan casually does it in by throwing a lance at it. The lance hits the beast, the beast keeps coming, the cool Spartan just stands there, and then the beast expires, sliding forward and coming to rest at the very feet of the cool Spartan. How gripping! How dramatic! How stupid can you get?The Spartans are undone by a creature who is supposed to be a deformed Spartan but who looks like a cross between an Orc, Gollum, and the Hunchback of Notre Dame. This creature shows the Persians a trail around to the Spartans' rear.Back in Sparta, Leonidas's wife, Queen Gorgo, is trying to persuade the Spartan ruling council to send an army to help Leonidas. (The complete mangling of history necessary to permit this particular plot twist is not worth going into here.) She needs to persuade a Spartan politician to back her, but he is a bad guy who wants her bod. She lets him have it as a quid pro quo. However, the next day he betrays her in the council, not backing her plea and calling her a whore. She grabs the sword of one of the guards and does in the bad guy, delivering a short speech to him while sticking him with the sword. While she is delivering her little speech, and the bad guy is writhing in agony, all the guards in the immediate vicinity are just standing around, doing nothing to try to stop any of this. Really believable, right?Back to Thermopylae. The Greeks get killed in an overdone scene.Now to the fields of Plataea, a year later, where a Greek army is about to take on the Persian army. A Greek delivers a supposedly inspiring speech about how they are going to defeat the Persians and so save the world from mysticism and tyranny, as if the Spartans' worship of Zeus and all the rest wasn't mysticism and as if Sparta, with most of its population comprising unfree helots that the Spartan citizens could murder at will once a year during Krypteia, was a paragon of civility.At this point, mercifully, the movie ends. Garbage, from beginning to end.",1,15,25,6 September 2009
Her," Mildly intriguing story, uninteresting main character, pretty slow
","The main character is a dud. He's a loser who cannot face reality. He buys a new operating system that is supposed to be everything he could want. He falls in love with it. Kind of clever. However, because he is a loser, it's hard (for me impossible) to get attached to him or care much what happens to him. I only finished watching it because that's what I always do.The acting is pretty good. In my opinion, Scarlett Johansson deserved an Oscar as best supporting actress. She is the voice of the operating system. She does such a good job delivering her lines that you feel she is standing there, though in fact she never appears. She is able to convey a wide range of emotions by the cadence and inflection of her voice. She makes her giggles and gasps sound as if she is right there taking part in the action the way a normal actress would.I would say the show is worth watching if you like SciFi or if you are bored and need something to distract you.",5,2,3,15 January 2016
Alien: Covenant," Data versus Lore, Seen It All Before
","The first two, maybe even four, Alien movies were fun. Alien vs Predator wasn't bad. This thing is boring, predictable garbage.If you have seen the StarTrek Next Generation installments on Data and Lore, then you have seen the plot of this movie. There is nothing new or imaginative about it. Nothing interesting.The Alien itself apparently is thrown in solely as a come-on. The Alien is what Alien movies are supposed to be about, but the Alien here does nothing but give the producers an excuse to put Alien in the title. It isn't scary. It isn't surprising. There's nothing new or imaginative about it. (Pardon me if I repeat myself.) It is nearly irrelevant to the plot, which is about the two androids.If you are bored out of your skull and have a bottle of liquor to kill, then maybe you will find this show worth your time. If you are looking for an imaginative plot, a scary Alien, or anything new, spend your time doing something else.",2,3,5,25 June 2017
