3:10 to Yuma," Classic western for the modern viewer
","I really love westerns. The stories, the gunfights, the scenery, the slightly over-the-top characters- all of it. However I'm in my 20s and the heyday of westerns was long before my time (many thanks to cable and premium channels for keeping them alive.) They are dated, both in quality of filming and acting and in freedom of expression. This 3:10 to Yuma captured the spirit of those old westerns with today's more serious acting and improved cinematography and special effects.The plot was the very definition of a western: war veteran family man, failing ranch, greedy railroad men, gang of outlaws with a dashing leader. Much like the previews suggest and enjoyable the entire time. The acting may not have been 'oscar caliber' but everyone was right on character. Ben Foster had no problem on screen with Christian Bale and Russell Crowe, and even the young Logan Lerman (had to go look his name up) held his own. Nice to see Peter Fonda and Alan Tudyk, minor characters but memorable moments.The violence was stronger than back when, though not deserving of the R it was given. PG-13 only I would think, comparable to the X-Men series or teen horror movies. The eldest son was played by an actor too 'young' to see an R movie! PG-13 also for the mild-strong language and sexual situations more vague than a Viagra commercial.",8,2,6,7 September 2007
Star Trek," Incredible Effects, Questionable Resurrection
","This film really has two different views, how good a movie it is and how good a Star Trek resurrection it is. As a movie it's a fun big-budget action film. The effects were incredible, exactly what every movie should aspire to emulate. Computer effects were used where necessary and attention was paid to the detail so it never detracted from the story. Physical effects/action were used where they would be best appreciated and would help to keep the audience (and actors) in the story. The plot was coherent enough for enjoyment, though it was clearly an action film and not a drama. I'm not sure how humorous it would be if you're not familiar with the Star Trek characters, but there were enough little tidbits just for the fun of it that everyone should get at least a chuckle or two. Highly recommended if you are looking for a good shoot 'em up time. If you're a big Trek fan, I (and my mother, also a big Trek fan) thought these characters were very believable as the younger selves of the original icons. All the necessary nods were included and most of the humor stemmed from this. That said, I'm not sure I could ever watch another film with these characters. The story veered greatly from the original history and some of the branches are just a little too weird for my fan comfort (I'm sure someone with spoilers will make mention of these few oddities). I liked having this glimpse into their youth but if any future movie is made I hope they will place new characters into this universe with the same style, careful action and fun.",6,1,6,10 May 2009
The Hunger Games," Hoping for action? Bit of a disappointment.
","I read the Hunger Games for a book group and thought it was a good teen novel, light entertainment for adults and mediocre dystopian literature. I was intrigued by the arena and the future technology employed in the fight to the death, though (I was a fan of The Running Man back in the 80s as well.) So I made the comment the story would work well as an action movie. I was told it was going to be a movie, and now it is.Alas, as a teen novel it had to be made PG-13 and to keep that rating the children-killing-children aspect had to be toned down. It was handled by jerky, out-of-focus shots of the actual murders, with clear visuals of either the dead bodies or of the splash of blood or sometimes just an eerie scream. Intense for younger children, appropriate for the target audience, somewhat dull for my bloody taste. I went on a bargain evening though, so for $7 I'm actually satisfied.It's not a cheesy Twilight-like teen romance. The main subject (beyond the story of the central character, Katniss) seems to be the carefully planned violence and tribute 'storylines' of the 'reality' broadcasts. It not-so-subtly parallels our own viewing habits and personally I enjoyed the irony. A love story does play a small role, about equal to that of the emotional toll on the children being forced to kill-or-be-killed. Worth a viewing if you have any interest.",6,4,9,27 March 2012
Public Enemies," Dull and poorly enunciated
","I got this on DVD because I wasn't interested enough to see it in theaters, and apparently I wasn't interested enough to see it on DVD. I found it incredibly dull and difficult to understand everyone's odd accents. There were some Midwestern attempts I believe, and I swear some were going for British (?!) or maybe just 'East coast elite'. I don't know and it would have been more successful if they all just skipped it. Christian Bale can keep his unusual American accent though, it's comprehensible and I think his normal accent is still thick British so that would have been out of place. Some movies need to be 2 hr 20 min, this one needed to be 1 hr 45 min. I think I would have preferred an upbeat action film, not a docu-drama. It was stylish and the actors were certainly good if the plot interests you, I just thought the story and execution boring.",4,2,3,25 December 2009
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Silly Bit of Action Fun
","I saw this as part of a double feature, had no expectations going in. It is probably the most exciting and stunning film a 12-year-old boy has ever seen, for an adult it's silly and fun and utterly unrealistic.I enjoyed it.Here's my issue/warning: I thought it was the Middle Eastern twin bother of In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (I had to go look it up, neither movie is that memorable). For reasons I don't quite understand people HATED that movie. This movie has all the same characteristics: lots of special effects fighting, special effects landscapes, impossible anatomical movements, ridiculous evil characters, PG romance, PG family tensions, no sense of history or travel, creative fighting tools and techniques, a silly sense of self, light comedy, respectable but smaller-name actors. I actually thought it was going to have the same writers and director, but no. Prince has a slightly bigger budget which led to bigger fake landscapes, but that's about it. If you hated the King movie I can't imagine you'll like this, but the reverse is also true, if you enjoyed this you really should like the King movie.",5,7,17,29 May 2010
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Watse of Time and Money
","I'll start with the three good parts of the movie.I liked Gambit's style and power (there was a peek of it in the previews) he was fun.I loved Deathpool/XI's makeup, it was freaky and well done.Hugh Jackman is still sexy.That's the good stuff. Every good moment in the entire movie. The dialogue was incredibly lame (literally, limp and unable to stand on its own, I don't know how the actors got through it.) That's taking into account this is just a comic book action movie. The action could have been good, and I suppose in places was, but everything was GLARINGLY computer generated/enhanced. Sometimes it's needed (this is fantasy) but there were so many instances where a little effort in costumes, location or stuntmen would have helped add just a little realism to the movie: Wolverine's claws, that fat guy (get a suit, really), half the backgrounds, most of the fight scenes... It was WELL below the X-Men franchise's standards. The story seemed to conflict with the first three movies (I'm not a huge fan, I won't say for sure) and even if it didn't it was just so silly, I don't know what they were trying to do. Characters barely came in before they were never seen again, some I don't even know what their powers were. I didn't care about anyone. I hope they just let this franchise end, movie-wise.",4,2,9,1 May 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," For fans only
","At World's End starts up right away, no real reminders as to what came before, so be sure to be up on Dead Man's Chest before viewing. And do view, At World's End is slightly less silly and slightly more cohesive than Dead Man's Chest, though still not nearly as enjoyable as Curse of the Black Pearl, nor as satisfying overall (story and characters and visuals.) If you haven't see Pirates 1 or 2, don't bother with 3. The thin plot of At World's End will still leave you confused.The special effects are highly detailed and make for some impressive scenes, though some of the fighting is too improbable and so more like a cartoon than live action (a pet peeve of mine.) Regardless, worthy of the theater's big screen, or a really impressive television. Good fun and humor with Jack Sparrow (and a touch of Keith Richards) oddness, but for my audience it was the Jack the monkey (and the midget) who stole the laughter. See it without high expectations and enjoy.",6,0,2,25 May 2007
The Prestige," such potential
","My spoiler will come at the end. As stated this was a gorgeous movie, the period details and shots were lovely, worth at least 9/10 stars. The acting was high caliber and The Prestige (unlike the Illusionist) took some time with the magic and its procedure and performance (the technology and the showmanship, I love them both about 'magic'), which was what I looked forward to in each movie. The plot of competition, obsession and sacrifice was above average, which is more than I expected, so I was set to love it all. But because I loved it one of the twists (a single, ridiculous twist!) ruined the whole plot. The spoiler:The Prestige spends quite a bit of time explaining or teaching the science and technology behind the magic, and it dares to use a Victorian electric replicating machine! I would have preferred actual magic to fake science. Even fake science would have been fine, a vacuum tube or something, but truly fantastic science?! Star Trek could get away with it because it was set hundreds of years in the future, who knows what will happen, who cares, it's entertainment. This was just so wrong it stayed on my mind and ruined the finale. It's still bothering me today, and I've waited to be objective before I voted and commented.",5,2,7,21 March 2007
District 9," Well filmed, but too dark
","The previews I saw were vague so I had little expectation and got the DVD based on general 'good' reviews. The movie was certainly filmed well. It uses a documentary style, but a very professional and cleanly filmed documentary, not like the Blair Witch style. On-the-scene footage mixes with interviews and clips of security footage to set the background and then real time scenes move the story forward with no relation to the documentary. Subtitles are a necessity, I hope the theatrical version added them where needed. The aliens might be entirely CGI, or maybe a mixture of CGI and puppetry, but they were excellently rendered. The technology is finally up to interaction with real actors. So there are several aspects that deserve the good reviews.My low review score is based on the fact I had to stop a little more than an hour in because the story was just too dark. Almost every human in it was crudely and casually violent, cruel, and uncaring, both to the 'prawns' and other humans. It was a cast of near psychopaths. I don't need a happy movie, and I certainly expected violence and prejudice based on the film's description, but it was so unfeeling as to be unbelievable for me. Yes there's cruelty and torture in the world and apathy, especially from a distance, but my town doesn't get together to run crazy experiments, riot, murder and eat our foreign neighbors simply because they're different, and bug-like aliens or not these were clearly sentient beings so that's the parallel. I would have preferred more subtle discrimination with perhaps a few scenes of cruelty to show what humanity is capable of. The Johannasburg citizens are a part of the developed world, it could have been Paris or Washington or Shanghai. And scenes that reminded me of the Rwandan genocide descriptions were plopped right downtown. The evil corporation and mercenaries were too much for me. Just be aware of the tone before viewing.",4,1,4,2 January 2010
Mamma Mia!," Theater to Film Troubles
","This adaptation is getting the full brunt of my annoyance with films that were once musicals yet don't hire theatrical actors. It's a totally different style of acting, particularly with musicals where you need to sing and dance and be aware of your whole body every second of the song. I say sing but really they ridiculously lip-synch and dance, another annoyance. If actors and musicians can do it every night on stage why can't a film actor do it for a few scenes a few times a day! Stagger the filming so no one is singing too much at once, know what your doing physically so it's only a couple takes. I'd rather see little cutting bloopers than the weird mouth movements and missed dance steps of fake singing! This is a romantic comedy cast and what looks like random Greek locals who accidentally stumbled into a musical and tried to make the best of it. I'm blaming the director for the uncontrolled mess they made of it, because I'm blaming him also for the choppy cutting between pretty Greek locations and crappy CGI backgrounds- again, plan ahead in your filming!Other than several tiny points which drive me crazy this is just the fun, silly musical it advertises itself to be and on which people based their recommendation to me. Good for a light evening or weekend afternoon viewing. Make sure you like ABBA first, this is a full-fledged musical.",4,2,4,17 December 2008
The Dark Knight," Good as Batman Begins...No Better
","I saw The Dark Knight this afternoon and enjoyed it. It had a light psychological storyline similar to Batman Begins and lots of crazy action sequences within a city/set more realistic than the average CGI comic book movie, all in all a good time.When I returned to add a comment and saw that this was the #1 movie with 9.7 rating I thought, 'WHAT!' It's just a comic book movie that clearly and successfully aims for and holds back to be a PG-13 family summer blockbuster. Do NOT expect more than that. There are no serious injuries, no blood, no cussing, and everything works out OK in the end. Yes the Joker is a crazy weird guy (like the first Batman but with more 'natural' and freakier makeup) but the fear he instills in the city is not felt by the audience because no one is shown to be harmed by him. Harvey Two-Face's transformation could have been fabulous but the special effect damage to his face was the same as this year's Terminator television series, completely unrealistic (unless you're a futuristic robot) to keep the PG-13 rating. The audience doesn't feel his pain and I was actually jarred every time he spoke because it's not physically possible, like watching a dubbed dialogue.If you enjoyed Batman Begins (or Batman and Batman Returns) you'll enjoy this movie, if you aren't a fan of action comic book films don't be swayed to believe this is anything more.",6,3,8,20 July 2008
Taken," Great, REAL Action
","There was a solid enough suspense story to this film, but it was the action that was unexpected and exciting. There was very little (or very unobtrusive) digital special effects, which is so rare nowadays. There was plenty of quick fights with guns, hands, knives and other handy equipment. A lot of 'MacGyver' moments, some car chases and cool spy stuff. I wouldn't say it always kept you guessing, but there were plenty of gasps and more than enough interesting bits throughout. I think what really impressed me is that there were REAL actors/stuntmen on film, moving about, no digital enhancement needed, and it looked great. I saw this at the drive-in after Wolverine and that was full of poorly finished computer effects and overdone fight scenes that ruined the movie. This was a perfect contrast and a better film.",7,0,0,1 May 2009
The Departed," Better acting than plot
","I thought the actors held the movie together, they played off one another well despite being hampered by the script. Not that the story was bad, it just missed that psychological depth it was (I think) shooting for and came off as a slightly more deep than normal cop-shooting-action movie. In the 2 1/2 hours the developments of the cop mole and the mobster mole were short and time was rushed, not just in the early years, where that is expected, but throughout the undercover operations, so that each character advanced without the audience quite knowing how and why. The scenes often jumped back and forth between the two moles, comparing them, yes, but adding more to the fast-paced action feel. The supporting cast were all brusque and cutting, which was enjoyable, but as seen in an action film. There was little connection between any characters, including the rather ridiculous love interest who could have been the emotional release, but the story skimmed over that, again, too quickly. Too many years were covered, and had to be covered for both of them, without a clear focus. I'm interested to see what scenes were actually cut from the film. Not Scorsese's best work,but don't expect that and it's a darkly fun cop flick.",5,0,1,5 March 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," Very enjoyable
","Without being able to nail down precisely why, this movie is just wonderful. It's original and quirky without being too off the wall. It's funny in a dry and clever way (not at all what I expected from Will Ferrell), but also dramatic and romantic. The main characters are all so well cast the actors fit perfectly and work together naturally. Even visually it's 'just right'. As a reader I enjoyed the completely non-specific references to literature that still hit the mark (probably a different mark for every viewer.) It reminds me very strongly of The Shawshank Redemption, not in any specific way, but how both movies just leave you feeling good, glad that you got to see them, appreciative of the work that you never consciously noticed because you were lost in the film. Because of that no one part stood out to generate rave reviews and buzz and all that, which is too bad, but I think, like The Shawshank Redemption, this movie will just stay quietly popular for nearly everyone for years to come.",9,1,2,5 March 2007
Inception," Spectacular Film, Mediocre Ending
","For 2 hours, 14 minutes and 50 seconds this was an incredible movie. A perfect 10. There were flawless effects, creative and beautiful. A complex story that was still comprehensible, it begged to be watched again and again. Good acting for fun and interesting characters. Drama, humor, action, everything you could want from a movie. Usual Suspects crossed with Gattaca crossed with James Bond... just great.So why the vote of 8? A weak, indecisive, pathetic, lousy, pick-your-derogatory-adjective 10 second ending. I am not alone in my opinion, the majority of the audience scoffed, jeered or sighed in disgust at the final scene. A proper ending was possible. Two endings as a matter of fact. I had one preference, some may have chosen the other option, but too not choose... it's the worse offence. My preferred ending would have garnered this film a 10, the other ending a 9, the lack of ending brought it all the way down to an 8 and I'll certainly never purchase this on DVD. So disappointing.",8,2,7,24 July 2010
Inside Llewyn Davis," Great Coen Musical
","I saw a preview of Inside Llewyn Davis last night. The press got the best seats reserved and members of the local folk station, which is playing several cuts from the soundtrack, got the rest. It was a logical move to fill the seats with people who should like the movie and fans of folk from the 60s through today should like the movie. The many songs are nearly all full length and performed by proper musicians (and Justin Timberlake.) Oscar Isaac is actually an actor now, but began as a musician and plays a struggling musician in 1961 New York City. I can't say if he's a good actor or well cast, but he is a great performer. Despite my dig at Timberlake, mostly due to his perfectly appropriate branding, he performed well also. His fans are unlikely to enjoy his performance, he plays folk songs in the style of Peter, Paul and Mary. That's not the only surreal aspect to the movie since it is fully Joel and Ethan Coen. This one is very dark, far more like No Country for Old Men than O Brother Where Art Thou despite the music, and funny if you like their humor (I do.) The Coen-style conversation is covered by Carey Mulligan and John Goodman with many other characters providing one-liners and other humorous moments, proper actors all. Music fans and Coen fans will all enjoy parts of the film, and soundtrack fans and Coen fans will love the final result. Hope it comes to a theater near you.",8,1,2,12 December 2013
The Fighter," Great Movie
","This was far more than the inspirational sports movie whose category it may fall under, though in that respect it satisfies as well. It was darker and funnier and deeper than the previews indicated. Both the sport and family fights of boxers Micky Ward and Dicky Eklund are dramatized here, along with a striking representation of working class Lowell. This is where much of the humor came in, at least for the Worcester, MA audience. The Eklund/Ward family are a bit of a caricature, chain smoking and full of attitude and profanity, but so very close to the truth we all saw a relative, friend, neighbor, ourselves. The close knit neighborhood communities are also shown. Pick your MA city and the movie could have been filmed there. It could translate to other locales, but if not the story itself is still great. Every major character was portrayed excellently. I was surprised by Wahlberg's gravity (and fantastic physique, if you're interested) and Adams' grittiness. I was also reminded of Bale's talent, there was a clip in the credit of the real Eklund and Bale was spot-on. Action, drama, humor and redemption come together for one of the best movies of the year.",8,2,4,18 December 2010
