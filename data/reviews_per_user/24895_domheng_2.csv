Sucker Punch," Alice in Wonderland with machine gun and Japanese sword
","Another masterpieces from Director Zack Snyder after Dawn of the Dead, 300, Watchmen and Legend of the Guardians. A lot of slow motion, a lot of close up and a lot of fight.The story is a girl - Baby Doll locked away in a mental asylum, the director put in the element of fantastical world in her imagination, how she fight for break out from mental asylum. The first part is kept me on seat and get exciting to keep going, but not until when she start to get the third item - the knife from kitchen chef, Sweet Pea was change her mind so quick, Baby Doll use her 'Magic Dance' to the chef and the radio breakdown, cause Rocket get killed... is a bit artificial... Just like what Sweet Pea said to Baby Doll at last 'Is got to be another way' to make it more interesting and exciting.But what i really like is the wardrobe design, is very nice costume from Michael Wilkinson who did TRON: Legacy, Terminator Salvation and Watchmen, there is so much detail and effort to those girl's costume.The fight choreographer and stunt coordinator Damon Caro who did The Bourne Ultimatum which is very nice.Visual Effects is good, especially the Japanese soldiers scene, the dragon and the pink rabbit robot, they are nice design.The music score, i don't think is suitable, I really don't like itThe camera work is good, is exciting, such as the shot that on back stage make-up room mirror, Sweet Pea is talking to Rocket before Baby Doll come in talking about 'the 4 items' the shot is so smooth.By the way i vote it 8. You must watch it at cinema. NICE work director Zack Snyder",8,5,19,24 March 2011
Furious 7," not a good i-max 3d experience
","i went to cinema for i-max 3d, i'll not recommend for i-max 3d, the cut is very fast, my friend sit next to me feel fuzzy after watched, director James who really like a lot of fast cut, jump cut for some point, camera rotate style in action.... This is a fantastic conclusion to honor Paul Walker's death. The cast are same, as usual funny Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous, there is another cast like Jason who quite the same Jason, Tony who also same as usual good perform of action martial art, very entertaining, but i personally still feel that FF6 is better than 7. i am appreciated to all the crew to bring me exciting, fun, cool action. Director James Wan is better direct the horror film than direct an action. I'm not saying James is worse, i can see he put an effort but his style is not suitable for this",7,3,17,1 April 2015
