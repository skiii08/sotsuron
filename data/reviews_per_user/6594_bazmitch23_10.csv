Whip It," Sorry Drew
","Every time an actor or actress directs their first movie, they fail. Except for Ben Affleck.What's wrong with this film: It's just another clichéd sports movie: The main character wants to do a sport but her parents forbid her, so she secretly does the sports behind their backs. The team don't like her and bully her, but warm up to her later. Main character's parents discover she's doing the sport and get her out of the team just when the big championship is coming up. Main character does a motivational speech to make her parents put her back in the team, it works. Main character joins the team just in time to take part in the championship, we've seen this many times.Ellen Page is the same sarcastic character she always is and Zoe Bell can't act. However, it was nice to see Drew play a different character than the one she usually plays. In this film, she plays a wild woman who's is all brawn but no brain.And for the hundredth time, we seen the 'friends fall out' cliché.",1,2,7,4 December 2013
Nacho Libre," I only watched it cos it was from the director of Napoleon Dynamite
","That was movie was funny, in a very eccentric way. This movie I didn't find funny. Jack Black is the same character he always is. But when is he NEVER the same character? What was Peter Stormare's character about? He was just in the movie for no apparent reason. The fart jokes were unnecessary. Napoleon didn't have any toilet humour in it what so ever. That movie didn't need any. But it's like Paramount told Jared Hess 'You need toilet jokes in this movie. It does star Jack Black after all.' Jared had no choice but to put toilet jokes in it. The farts just come out of random and have no purpose. Maybe 5 year olds liked it. The only joke I found funny was when the villain Sancho is getting his massage and his trainer says to him 'Sancho is number 1. His legs are number 1.' That made me laugh.The film tries to combine Napoleon Dynamite's style with Jack Black's style and the two don't mix very well.",1,1,3,12 December 2013
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," So-so
","There were a few things a liked about this film such as Michael Chiklis as The Thing (he also gets the best laughs in the film), Johnny showing a serious side to him, Alba in that skin tight outfit (we get some nice shots of her from behind), Laurence Fishburne's voice as The Silver Surfer (who better?) and Simon Webbe's song 'Ride the storm' is awesome.But there are many things I disliked such as Alba's acting, her obviously fake hair, the fact that the military were stupid enough to trust Von Doom (did they not know what Von Doom tried to do to New York?), the Surfer's main reason for destroying planets is just explained in a very lazy 'Because I must.' Why? Also, I'm suppose to sympathise with a character who destroys innocent planets and kills innocent beings? And Sue's death scene was ruined by Alba's woodenness and from being very clichéd. And you gotta love how she dies. She just moves her head down and just has her eyes open. Also in that scene, Von Doom throws his spear at the Surfer and he doesn't run out of the way, so Sue sacrifices herself. How about using an invisible force field to knock the spear away, Sue? Like you always do.Also, how did the Fantastic 4's car get from America to Serbia very fast? And how were they able to get from Sebria to China really fast? Answer: Cos in Movie Land, you get from country to country in under 5 minutes.Another factual error is that when the helicopter crashes onto the roof and the blades are heading towards the blind girl. How comes she didn't hear it coming towards her and just stood there not knowing? Remember a blind person sense of hearing is a lot stronger.Also, the Mr Fantastic stretching effects still look weak and as for The Silver Surfer's reason for saving Sue: She reminded him of his girlfriend. So out of all the beings on every planet you destroyed, you just happened to find a being who looked just like your girlfriend?Earth is saved at the end, but shouldn't we feel sorry for the other planets Galactus destroyed? Ah, screw 'em. We're the best planet in the Universe. Who cares?",6,0,1,14 January 2014
Event Horizon," 'Do you see? Do you see? DO YOU SEE?'
","I've seen this movie over 20 times. I love it. And I'm not a big Anderson fan. Now, his wife on the other hand.........Anyway, I'm a big 90's kid and this is a true 90's horror film. The idea of a haunted house movie in a spaceship is a good one. Anderson may suck as a writer, but he actually not that bad of a director. As long as he is not writing the script, it's okay.He knew how to scare people with this movie. The jump scares are great and there is a lot of moments that make you cringe. Like the video footage scene and D.J.'s demise. (shudder!) For me, the most intense scene is when Justin is in the airlock without a suit. This scene really had me on the edge of my seat.The Effects are still great. The model for the Event Horizon looks amazing. There are a few moments of poor CGI, like the scene where Justin goes into the core and there's bad CGI blobs everywhere and when the Lewis and Clark explodes. But everything else holds up today.And you gotta love that corridor. It's so HUGE! The filmmakers used a very big mirror to make it look bigger. Same trick used in Aliens.The performances are great. Sam Neil is very creepy as Dr Weir, and Richard T. Jones was very funny as Cooper. Normally the comic relief is the most annoying character in the film. But Cooper works because he's not played by a comedian, he's not annoying and he's not stereotypical. Also, they avoid the 'Killing the black guy' cliché. Well, Miller dies though.However, some of the editing in the climax between Miller and Weir is a bit choppy and what's with the massive close ups on Weir's mouth in that scene? A failure on release, but has found it's audience on TV and DVD. There are teenagers discovering Event Horizon today. Overall, the best movie Anderson has made. I think he said that this is his favourite movie he's done.",9,0,1,16 October 2013
Hotel Transylvania," Good idea, but not executed very well
","My friend and I wanted to go see this for Halloween. We liked the idea of a hotel for monsters. We both hated it. The characters moved in very OTT way and it was distracting. Every shot was a close up on someone's face, I just wanted to push them away from the camera. The jokes weren't funny, it has the typical Adam Sandler toilet jokes that just make me groan. Jonathon was REALLY annoying. He was this films' Jar Jar. But worst of all we have the 'Liar Revealed' cliché. Dracula pretends this human is a monster, they keep the lie up, at the end everyone finds out, they banish the human but then they realize they liked human so they want him back before he gets home.We've seen this MILLIONS OF TIMES!However, there were a few things I liked about it; the flying tables scene was very creative. It was like a Terry Gilliam scene, Steve Bucemi's wolfman was funny and there were a few good gags. The animation was nice and Mavis was cute in a very goth way.I hated it, but I'll give it a 4 for at least trying.",2,21,39,22 March 2013
Alice in Wonderland," One of Burton's weakest
","Getting Burton to direct this seemed like a good idea at the time, but his vision of Alice doesn't work.He said that he hated the 1951 animated film, and you can't do a follow up to something you dislike.Making this film a sort of sequel also confused audiences. Granted Burton wanted it to be that way, due to the amount of hate remakes get. So they decided to go the sequel road. Everything is dull and grey, the typical Burton look. And everything is all CGI, which looks really fake. Burton explained his hatred for CGI and green screen on the Corpse Bride DVD. And what did he do on this film?Johnny Depp was the typical weirdo he always plays. Also he character switches between an English accent and a Scottish one. I know it was to add to the madness of the character, but its just so distracting.Also, there is a scene where Alice drinks pee.Yeah, when the White Queen (Anne Hathaway doing ANOTHER fairy tale movie!) is making a drink to make Alice bigger (or smaller, I can't remember), she spits in it and pours pee in it. And Alice drinks it. Yeah, Lewis Carol would be proud. When did this turn into the Farrelly Bros' version of Alice?Now there were a few things I liked such as Mia as Alice. She's quite sexy. Those sexy shoulders. I think that's the reason why Alice is 19 in this. They wanted a more older, sexier Alice.It was also really cool to see Alice be a bad ass, although how did she learn how to fight?I've seen every Burton film, and I have to say this, Planet Of The Apes and Dark Shadows are the weakest of his filmography.I didn't like the remake of Frankenweenie either.",1,4,7,14 January 2014
Dark Shadows," Predictable
","I've never seen the TV series, so don't hurt me.This movie was based on a show from the 70's that not many people I know talked about. I think that was one of the reasons this movie didn't do well. That and people thought Tim Burton/Johnny Depp's schtick was getting tiresome. Their thoughts were 'Not ANOTHER Burton/Depp movie!'The plot is the typical fish out of water story that has been done a million times. Barnabas doesn't know what a car is, or a TV is, or why isn't anything like the century he lives in now. It's such a big cliché.Johnny Depp just plays the same weirdo he always does. He always has that curious, innocent look on his face. The frown and the widen eyes.Aside from Depp, Burton has to cast Helena and Christopher Lee AGAIN!Don't you hate it when directors cast the same actors over and over and over? It's like when Wes Anderson always casts Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson again and again.The cinematography is awful. Ever since Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Tim Burton always has his movies out of focus and pale. It's like if you were taking a picture on your camera and turned the focus off. And characters with white faces are another Burton cliché.The whole thing about Carolyn turning into werewolf at the end is never explained. This movie is just lazy and doesn't bother telling you anything.When Barnabas bites Victoria at the end and says 'My curse has been lifted.' How? You're still a vampire. But who cares? This movie sucks.The only good thing about this tripe is Eva Green. She has so much fun playing a sexy witch.Hey, Eva Green pukes GREEN vomit. Geddit?",1,2,4,21 November 2013
Rango," Meh
","The animation is superb and so is the voice acting. Isla Fisher, Bill Nighy and Alfred Molina are on top form. And it's nice to see Tim Olyphant NOT play a bad guy for once.However, I hated the first 20 minutes. The filmmakers had no idea what to do with it. It's just Rango doing things.Also, be sure to throw in a cameo from Hunter S. Thompson for all the Depp fans. Don't worry about the kids. They won't know who Thompson is.Depp plays his typical weirdo role and Stephen Root is back once again playing the southern idiot like he always does.Some jokes work and others just make you want a tumbleweed to bounce past the screen.The plot didn't interest me and it has the clichéd 'Lair revealed' (Yes, I got that from Doug Walker) and the 'Meet the old legend after you've screwed up to give you advice so that you can go back to the town to save the day.'However, some scenes are creative like Rango's dream of cacti turning into snake rattles and how Rattlesnake Jack has a mini gun instead of a rattle. Rango is just worth watching once.",2,0,0,2 September 2013
The Conjuring," 'Stop farting. It really stinks.'
","This film was too similar to The Amityville Horror for me. The clock stopping at 3 in the morning, the bad smell in the house, the strange noises, the dog knowing that there's something wrong with the house. There are some great jump scares and the Exorcism finale was terrifying. But this movie will make you go 'Seen it before.' There's nothing new.And the whole thing about the doll is never explained. It was expecting it to come to life like a Chucky movie.The film claims to be based on a true story, but I don't believe in that tripe.",1,5,12,17 September 2013
The Simpsons Movie," Adequate
","Back in the 90's, my friends and I were desperate for a Simpsons movie. There would be a rumor that it would happen, but then it turned out to be false. So, when a Simpsons movie was finally announced, we were excited.Yeah, it took 2 decades for a movie of our favourite TV show to come out. Yeah. One of the biggest problems with The Simpsons Movie is that it came too late. The show had been going on since 89 and in 2007, Simpsons mania was wearing thin. The show was going downhill for the fans. The episodes got weaker and weaker showing that the writers had lost their touch. This is what happens when you have a show that's been running for too long. It's like a joke that's been repeated over and over again.Whereas the South Park movie came out 2 years after the debut of the show and Beavis and Butt-head Do America came out 3 years after that show debuted. Those films worked really well and still hold up.The main problem with this film is that the whole plot involves Homer dumping pig crap into Springfield's water. Really. It took 11 writers and that was the best plop...... sorry, plot that they can come up with?Also, Grandpa's possession was just lame. I know the filmmakers needed to get a plot here and now, but having Grandpa be possessed like that was just lame and un-Simpson like.Other scenes I hated where: - Bart drinking whisky. Honestly. - Bart drawing on the most wanted picture in the shop. Seriously, how did the shop keeper not recognize them immediately? Also, the joke where the family who look like the drawing and get caught was done before. - 'The soft, tough, soft, tough' gag is NOT funny. The filmmakers found it funny, but not the audience. Also, it's not as exciting as the South Park or Beavis and Butt-head movies. I remember leaving the cinema with my friends going 'Yeah, it was good, I guess. Not brilliant, but good.' But does it hold up after 6 years? Not really. Too many pop culture gags. Which is never good, cos In 20 years time, someone will watch this movie and not get the pop culture gags at all.Now here are the things I did like:<ul><li>The score. Hans Zimmer is a genius. - The scale. When the dome is put over Springfield, it looks amazing to watch in the cinema. I love it in movies when things look enormous. - Marge's video tape to Homer. There's just something so realistic about Julie performance in that scene. - The climax is kind of exciting. Springfield looks incredible in those shots. - Homer's line 'Risking my life to save people I hate, for reasons I don't understand.'</li></ul>PS. How did Russ Cargill get on the cliff to point the shotgun at Bart and Homer? Also, how did Maggie get there? And how was she able to lift a big heavy rock to drop on Cargill. Plus, when Homer and Marge are on the motorbike driving down the forest, howcome no glass is there from the broken dome?",6,0,0,1 November 2013
