First Man," Ryan gosling nails it!
",A truly great movie that shows the struggle that Neil Armstrong and his crewmates had to go through in order to be the best of the best and survive their mission with technology from the 1960s not to drive to the grocery store but to land on the moon and return home! Well done! Ryan gosling does an excellent job of portraying Neil Armstrong.,10,3,6,15 April 2019
