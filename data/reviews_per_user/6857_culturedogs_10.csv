Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Brilliant stuff, but confirms my thought that the movie was better served shown as a whole
","Quentin Tarantino closes his epic of betrayal and revenge with a slightly more meditative film, a pretty far cry from the action packed bloodbath that comprised Volume 1.  Uma Thurman returns as `The Bride' a.k.a. `Black Mamba' a.k.a. but that would be telling.   Anyway, she's back from being left for dead at the altar, to take revenge on the trio of killers left on her hit list:  Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver (California Mountain Snake), Michael Madsen as Budd (Sidewinder, also Bill's brother), and David Carradine as the titular `Bill.'  Along the way, we're treated to a further salute to eastern cinema, in flashbacks to Black Mamba's training under the querulous Pai Mei (thirty year Hong Kong vet Gordon Liu, playing his second role in the Kill Bill story, and reprising yet another classic recurring character from Asian cinema (like Sonny Chiba's Hatori Hanzo in Volume 1)).  What emerges from the whole is a story about love, redemption and the possibility of moving on from the ways of violence and war into, perhaps, an uncertain future.  And Volume 2 confirms my thought that the movie was better served shown as a whole.  Brilliant stuff.",Null,0,1,7 August 2004
50 First Dates," Pretty standard Sandler: Rob Schneider in a small role and lots of walrus vomit (but racist...?)
","Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore ply their chemistry well on screen for a second time, with this film that a friend of mine has described as `Memento: The Rom Com.' Barrymore is a car accident survivor who has lost her ability to form short term memories, so that every morning is, for her, the morning before the accident.  Enter Sandler, who, for purposes of this movie, is the sitcom version of a marine veterinarian:  he barely ever seems to have to show up for work, leaving him with plenty of time to woo Barrymore's accident victim, struggling to prove their relationship to her addled mind every day. (And, responding to the racism charge... yeah, it's true, this film was not fleshing out very deep or different characters out of its' Hawaiian cast... (Rob Schneider himself wasn't that deep) but everybody was pretty cardboard and barely above stereotypical.  Offensively so?  In the eye of the beholder, true, but I didn't go to this film to take my first notes for a history of Polynesian cultures... or veterinary medicine, for that matter...) After that, it's pretty normal Sandler, you know, Rob Schneider in a small role and lots of walrus vomit",Null,0,0,1 May 2004
Iron Man 3," The Best of the Iron Man films so far; Mandarin obsessives stay home
","The Mandarin was going to be a problem.Among Iron Man's rogues gallery, the Mandarin was going to be, perhaps, the toughest one to update. The visual basis for the character seemed to be the Fu-Manchu mold; his connection to the Cold War world of the original Iron Man was also problematic, but the Asian stereotype thing was either going to be straight up offensive, or mock-ably silly. The comics writers seemed to manage (just) to breathe new life into the character a bit, by choosing to develop the old character tropes in the light of a better understanding of Eastern cultures (sufficiently so for an ongoing comics series, anyway). But how do you bring a story arc with a character with that complicated a genesis to a major feature film series in the modern day without turning the story into an outdated Sax Rohmer adventure?Bringing in Shane Black, who turned in a very good modern noir/ mystery/ comedy with Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, and Ben Kingsley, who plays a Mandarin, that those who hold the original Stan Lee (Larry Lieber?) and Don Heck creation as beyond reproach, may actually hate; too bad, because the pieces of the Mandarin that are thrown to the fire for Iron Man 3, fuel a cracking good storyline involving another Marvel villainous institution (AIM) and Warren Ellis' contribution to the mythos, the Extremis virus.The film is framed as a confessional, as Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) recalls (as much as he can, that is) a very drunken Millennial New Year's Party (pre-super-armor), where he picks up researcher Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall), and is approached by AIM's Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), whose AIM proposal is dismissed by Stark. His brush-off of Killian and playboy tryst with Hansen will come back to haunt him...... in 'the present day', where Stark suffers restless insomnia and panic attacks following the mind-blowing cosmicness of his foray with aliens and gods in The Avengers. He tries to deal with it by endlessly tinkering with Iron Man armors, which friend Rhodey (Don Cheadle) and girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) both agree is not helping. Also not helping are the exploits of The Mandarin (Kingsley), an apparent international terrorist in something like the Bin Laden mode, but, Stark notes, who talks like 'a baptist preacher.' When The Mandarin's bombings end up harming his longtime pal and head of security, Happy Hogan (the returning Jon Favreau, director of the 1st two Iron Man films), Stark decides to take things personally and impulsively issues a threat to the terrorist leader.This impulsive act, unfortunately, directly moves Stark and his beloved Pepper (also Stark Industries' CEO) into the bull's-eye, and the ninety minutes that follow show us Stark as Iron Man, the hero, but also as a vulnerable human struggling to strategize his way out of an increasingly horrific situation.Along the way, it was a complete delight to find an Iron Man film so entertaining and recognizably coming from the creator of the offbeat Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (and, for that matter, Lethal Weapon).Black has a knack, an affection for offbeat, unbalanced heroes, and Downey's Iron Man is certainly the most unbalanced of Avengers' class of 2012 (okay MAYBE the Hulk, but his mood shifts are more on/ off switch volatile than kooky). Black's film also succeeds as a stand-alone that effortlessly exploits the larger Marvel cinematic universe, using Stark's Avengers experiences as a jumping-off point for some further (though never ponderous) soul searching. This is the smartest and funniest Iron Man (stand alone) film yet, and certainly among the smartest and most daring re-writes of a major comics property since Ang Lee's Hulk.The difference? Ang Lee's film ended up confused and confusing, losing its' great green superstar in the process. Iron Man 3 leaves us a resilient and smart franchise with the chutzpah we should expect from a superhero.And, naturally, you're staying till after the credits, right?",7,2,6,4 May 2013
Monster," Charlize Theron earned that Oscar, she did...
","Charlize Theron earned that Oscar, she did.  While this movie, in not atypical Hollywood fashion, plays fast and loose with the real world facts of the case, first time feature director Patty Jenkins casts the story of real life `first female serial killer' in the mode of two other films about disturbed, murderous individuals:  Terence Malick's 'Badlands', and Mary Harron's 'I Shot Andy Warhol.'  And, in light of this film's debt to Malick's classic take on the Charlie Starkweather case, it's more than a little unfair that Christina Ricci has taken some criticism for the low-key nature of her performance.  Her character here is basically Sissy Spacek's from 'Badlands,' repainted as a half-closeted lesbian.  Heck, Ricci's character here doesn't even get to narrate the story.  That job falls to Theron, and it's part of what makes this film a compelling and harrowing trip through the mind of one disturbed individual.",Null,0,0,25 April 2004
Dawn of the Dead," Action packed, intelligent and daring to be downbeat.
","Refitting the anti-consumerist messages of the old Dawn of the Dead to fit the jumpy, hyperkinetic, action packed template of recent horror action exercises (even stealing increased zombie speed and a certain graininess from 28 Days Later) turns out not to have been such a bad idea after all. Of course, grabbing from the most able and/ or typically underrated of b-list actors (Ving Rhames, Sarah Polley, Mekhi Pfifer and Jake Weber from TV's American Gothic) and keeping a keen focus on the characters of this remake doesn't hurt either.  Rookie feature director Zack Snyder ably exploits a witty, canny rewrite of George Romero's classic of Zombie holocaust run amok in and around a shopping mall.  The look here is less day-glo than the frequently well lit gore of 1978's Dawn, but cinematographer Matthew Leonetti is put to much better use with his dark frames here than in the reprehensible 'The Butterfly Effect.'  Action packed, intelligent and daring to be downbeat.",Null,0,0,1 May 2004
The Girl Next Door," Risky Business vs. Porky's (the 2004 rematch)
","What starts as a halfway decent update of 'Risky Business' loses its' way and cannot maintain the attempts at style made for the first 40 minutes or so.  After that, it doesn't fall completely apart, though.  Emile Hirsch is a shorter, and less able, version of Tom Cruise (as another young man about to move on to a predictably successful and boring)college career, but Elisha Cuthbert (TV's 24 ) is the main event, and manages to turn on the sex appeal for much of that first forty minutes.  After that, Timothy Olyphant is not too bad at basically being `Guido the Killer Pimp,' and, while Hirsch and Cuthbert's relationship grows more strained, Hirsch's two buddies (Chris Marquette's porn obsessed Eli and Paul Dano (L.I.E.) as the geeky Klitz) are fun to watch, sustaining much of the rest of the film.  Nice, though, to think that anyone in Hollywood these days would consider remaking a Risky Business, instead of the more blunt and simple minded Porky's films.",Null,0,0,25 April 2004
The Butterfly Effect," The Kutcher Effect (or when able second bananas on TV do films) (aka, the French Stewart Effect)
","This psychological time travel experiment would have enough problems with just its' less than well thought out script, but then they had to go and add Ashton Kutcher to it.  Kutcher plays a young man, plagued by mental blackouts his whole life, who eventually discovers a bizarre ability to travel mentally back through his life to change his past, and, repeatedly, his present.  This script manages to lose the ability to make any character likable, making them all pathetic and/or cardboard by turns, as the movie wallows in abuse revenge fantasies, prison rape scenarios, and, oh yeah, plenty of underage drinking, during a stint of which it seems this script was written.",Null,0,1,25 April 2004
Hellboy," Chiklis v. Ron Perlman cage match coming for Thing role (the loser gets to play Paste Pot Pete)
","WARNING!  POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILER! Ron Perlman stars as Mike Mignola's comic book hero:  a demon adopted when young by a paranormal investigator, who grows up to become a paranormal crimefighter and investigator.  And it's slam dunk casting in this Guillermo Del Toro film, that suffers, ever so slightly, from choppy editing and unnecessarily loose threads (i.e., demon eggs are left hatching in a New York City sewer, but later turn up whole in Russia???).   Karel Roden (the favorite vaguely European baddy from last year's 'Bulletproof Monk' and del Toro's previous, 'Blade II') plays Grigori Rasputin (yes, that Rasputin), who holds keys to Hellboy's true identity.  Selma Blair supports well as Liz, the disturbed and romantically conflicted pyrokinetic (at least in the movie incarnation), Jeffrey Tambor is the FBI boss struggling to understand his brood of strange characters, David Hyde Pierce voices merman/sensitive Abe Sapien and John Hurt shows up, in heavy make-up, as Hellboy's adoptive pop.   As wild and woolly visually, as well as on a character level, as any Jack Kirby comic (particularly his early 70's 'The Demon').  And here's a question: why hasn't Ron Perlman been cast as the Thing in the Fantastic Four movie yetÂ…?  Do I see a Michael Chiklis/ Ron Perlman cage match coming? The loser gets to play Paste Pot Pete!",Null,0,0,1 May 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," If you can't take the heat, stay out of the House of Blue Leaves...
","Once again, Quentin releases a film built to befuddle those who can't quite swallow cinematic violence, unless rendered devoid of all possible dramatic power, so as not to upset a general audience, or disgust someone's date...Fair enough.  I remember those screenings of 'Pulp Fiction' that found people heading for the doors even before Uma got a needle in the chest, and certainly by the time Christopher Walken describes in such detail how he protected the sole inheritance of a fellow P.O.W. to his only son.Yep, 'Kill Bill Volume I' is not 'Jackie Brown,' 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Reservoir Dogs,' as it surely was not intended to be.  Yes, Quentin is definitely reveling in his opportunity to offer his own unique take on the martial arts/ revenge films of his youth.  Did he go overboard, losing his way in cinema styles he only thought he could use to tell a story?Or, as I surmise, isn't this film the kind of wild, off-the-wall kind of presentation we should have hoped for from QT by now?  The kind that rabid fans of Asian action cinema go nuts over?'KBVI' is a big, broad blast of a violent comic book.  I don't think there's any mistaking that this film's ultra-violent visuals can be taken as a statement to all those critics who have taken umbrage with QT's violent content 'til now, dubbing artful, effectively presented action as 'too graphic' while absolving other films that dull down their content, despite often greater body counts, and sicker acts.  I suppose 'Freddy Vs. Jason' finds its' audience only because it falls beneath so many critics radar...To those expecting, or demanding, the dialogue driven stories of QT's previous films, there is some memorable dialogue to be had (Lucy Liu gets the big 'Samuel L.' style speech of this film), but be prepared for a much wilder and violent visual ride.To those who get itchy around Tarantino, and never liked 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Reservoir Dogs,' I say stay away.  If you never appreciated violent films before, you will hate this one.  Perhaps actively.  And the world doesn't really need a bunch of disenchanted filmgoers ready to take bloody revenge on QT.;^)...However, to those who can take this movie for what it is, a big broad opera of betrayal, violence and revenge (or, at least, half of one), I urge you to go and enjoy it on the big screen... ...and then on DVD...But I do wonder:  How can you actively hate a film that offers Uma Thurman in the Bruce Lee track suit from 'Game of Death' duelling with an army of Catos...?",Null,0,0,28 October 2003
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," EVERYBODY'S gotta learn sometime...
","Jim Carrey stars as a man, recently dumped by his girlfriend (Kate Winslet), who has decided to delete his memories of the woman, just as she has done her memories of him.  Unlike the good ol' days of alcohol induced amnesia though, they choose the modern way.  Electronic brainwashing, courtesy of Lacuna Corp. (in the persons of Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood).  What follows is a predictably trippy Charlie Kaufman script, a trip through the vagaries of memory, intimacy and romance and how we come to understand the phenomenon of love in and out of the context of our experiences.  In the hands of Michel Gondry (trippy video director, whose only previous feature (2001's Human Nature) was also a Kaufman collaboration), the film is a handheld tour through a melting dreamscape of disintegrating memories.  Great writer!  Great cast!  Great director!  A wonder to behold!",Null,0,1,25 April 2004
