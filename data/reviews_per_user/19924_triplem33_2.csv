","This is a paint by the numbers movie.1. Man loses/gives away girl 2. Man wants girl back. 3. Girl find new man..apparently perfect. 4. Man wants girl back. 5. Man makes effort to win her back. 6. Man wins her back 7. Perfect man...ah...not so much. 8. We all live happily ever after.Two things that bothered me. 1. Why is it that the 'new man' is always found wanting. Would be really interesting if she dumped him even though he was a good man. This certainly would make the film more interesting. She then would have to make a real choice. As it is there is no choice.2. You can't train for a marathon in 3 weeks. It would have been more realistic if the transformation took place over an entire year...for next year's marathon. It certainly would be more believable and demonstrate more of a dedication that would justify the transformation. Maybe transform the character in other ways: career, habits and lifestyle. I know its a comedy but this would have provided more depth and resonance to the story.",6,1,1,5 May 2016

","I remember seeing this movie when it came out. I was 13 at the time and I remember what I was wearing, a ball uniform, and the fact that I had a bad sunburn. The uniform was orange polyester and it was itchy. It did not dissuade me from experiencing the thrill of a life. I recall walking out of the theatre thinking that this was the best movie I have ever seen. Time has not diminished its impact. I saw it recently again and was amazed by its power.The music, the directing, the acting are all first rate. I had forgotten some of the scenes and they amazed me again. The use of the camera when Brody is watching the shark from the beach is amazing. I never thought of it at the time.And no they don't make movies like this anymore. Now there would be more blood and screaming - from the actors not the audience. Technically the film is so impressive - the editing is just right, not to much is shown but just enough to tantalize. I did find the special effects lacking but this was 30 years ago when Bruce had to be mechanical not CGI. I wish Spieberg would make movies like this again. His new efforts are first rate of course but they don't have the wonder of JAWS, ET and CE3K.Now I want to get the new DVD. A movie that wants to make me see it that quickly must be exceptional.",10,2,4,21 August 2005
