Deepwater Horizon," Good movie
","I was hesitating before going to see this movie , and when it was finished i was stunned. It is a very good movie and i discovered a lot about the life on offshore platform. Maybe it is not what the life really is on the platforms , but the films makes it looks like it is real. All the time i was discovering something new i didn't know on the work these guys are doing. Well , at some point it needs to be a movie , and of course there's a storyline and some exaggerations i think , but it's no big matter and it's very fun to watch. The fact it is based on real life events is really cool and adds something at the movie. I would recommend it to everyone !",7,2,4,5 November 2016
