The Sound of Music," sound of music still makes me shed tears, and i also view it in loving admiration which cannot be equaled.
","The Sound of Music is my most favorite movie ever!I saw it for the first time when i was 5yrs old and know all the songs and all the dialogue. It is the movie that i can watch everyday without getting bored. My kids love it too, my 12yr old son can play the backing music of all the songs on the piano! I always make him play them so I can sing along with them. We all know the story. We know of at least one of the immortal songs from the musical, 'The Sound of Music', 'Do-Re-Mi' or 'Edelweiss'(which is my favorite) . Julie Andrews was believable and unforgettable as the sweet, outspoken nun turned governess. Christopher Plummer was dashing as the Captain, and the supporting cast was one of the best I have ever seen. Fond memories have been remembered from some of the unforgettable sequences of this film that deservedly made it the best picture of 1965. The Sound of Music' is one of the worlds best loved treasures which keeps bringing generations of viewers to its attention.",10,3,10,13 April 2009
