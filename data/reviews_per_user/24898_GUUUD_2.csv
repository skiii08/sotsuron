The Avengers," Great Transformers 3 rip off!!!
","Don't get me wrong, I truly believed that this movie was great, but the epic finale was a complete transformers 3 rip off.Let's see.1. Bad guys has a device that opens a portal to even more bad guys. 2. The bad guys invades a city with small robots (transformers) or monsters (avengers) 3. The also have a huge robot or monster. 4. We get a gorgeous epic battle throughout the city with fun cgi. Very similar to each other. 5. The heroes tries desperately to close the portal, which they of course succeeds with.It's a lot of fun to read how Michael Bay make shitty films and that Joss Whedon is god.Both movies are great and ridiculously similar.",8,2,8,5 August 2012
Captain America: Civil War," Great movie but without game of throne balls
","Great movie with awesome action, spot on humor and a great cast. The only problem I have is that I feel absolutely nothing. I already know that no one is going to die even if they have 20 heroes fighting at the same time. Its entertaining but it lack real tension.I would love if they at some point grow a pair and lets say goo-die tush Capatain A kill Iron man in the end. That I would have felt and it would create great ripples in future movies.However, its still a great ride and I got what I paid for. Maybe next time they will surprise me and make me feel something, but probably not.Sorry for my crap English but I think you got it!",8,5,13,29 August 2016
