Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great expectations, great delusion: the 1999 great marketing exhibition
","Really, TPM was more an exhibition of new products than a motion picture. For example, take the pod race and the pod race video game. And all that action figure stuff that has invaded the stores. I am aware of that precisely because of my genuine interest in getting deeper into the SW saga. I needed to know somethong about the Empire of about the Republic, but definitely not about midiclorians (what a sort of scientific trash and/or of a spoiler of the mystic qualities of the force!) Less Jarjar Binks, more Darth Maul, less Anakin (what a parodie of a hero) more QuiGon,more ObiWan, more Amidala, less R2 and 3PO.Boy, George, you are definitely spoiling all of the story with those ludicrous links. Where in the name of the Force is the story? Cause it is just a group of sequences, a groupof exhibitions of all the merchandising stuff. Probably made for kids,could be,but wasnt that the case with the original trilogy? Then, we could infere that 99s kids are more alienated and less wise or sharpminded than 77s!! Is it that?Please tell me!",Null,0,1,2 August 1999
