Spider-Man 2," Better than expected

Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Getting better

It Chapter Two," Fun and jumpy
",This film has a lot of moments that make you laugh and jump. I really enjoyed not knowing when I was gonna laugh or jump whilst watching this film. Definitely a great following on from IT chapter 1 and must watch for any horror fan.,8,0,1,17 September 2019
A Nightmare on Elm Street," There is better
",I found the 2010 remake of this film slightly better but considering when this film was made its still a fun scary adventure into the mind of freddy plus this film does have parts that arent seen in the 2010 remake i would advise watching the 2010 version before watching this one tho.,5,1,9,16 June 2019
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," On the up
",Good film full of action and a bit of comedic directing to think it is better than the other two easy to understand what is happening as well,6,2,2,18 November 2018
