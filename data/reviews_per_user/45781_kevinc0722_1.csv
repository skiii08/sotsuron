Sucker Punch," What dudes would like packed in to one movie
","Basically the movie is based on 3 things, surrealism, anime and bad-ass chicks. The idea is simple, take everything a guy would like(sexy chicks, hot uniforms, dragons, guns, robots, mechanic samurai etc), add the 3 elements listed above, throw all of it in to a movie blender and 'bam!' comes Sucker Punch.Plot is out of the window due to the strong surrealism, since anything goes and whatever that's out of place or doesn't make sense can can be explained.Visuals is awesome just like any other Zack Snyder film, and the music complimented the overall atmosphere nicely.Fight and action sequence is a bit predictable and dull at moments, but still worth a look. One reason for the dullness to me is because the girls wasn't delivering enough bad-ass-ness(but are still hot). The added touch of the ultra-tough body physics which you see in anime or manga was quite interesting and different.Despite the clich√© dialog and redundant guns and katana fight scene that you see ever so often these days, Sucker Punch is still quite joyful to watch, because of all the things guys can't resist liking. As for the lady friend you're bringing along with, prepare her a pillow.",7,8,20,23 March 2011
