The Monuments Men," if you wish to waste some of your precious time
","If is very unusual for me to give up on a film before the end, even though afterwards I might feel that I have wasted my time. But this film is exceptional. I have never experienced such a waste of opportunities. A good - true - story, good caste of experienced actors, and the potential for some action, as well as some photogenic scenes, should have led to a reasonable film. It fails because it is badly written and badly directed. It is also poorly conceived - a comedy drama on such topic! On a side note, there is a lot of confusion about Nazi art, in this film and more generally. The Germans both bought and stole art, from Jew and non-Jew. The treatment of artworks at the end of the war didn't always clearly distinguish between these different categories. There was a notorious incident in which the real Monuments Men resisted orders from their military superiors to send several hundred works of art to the USA, as war spoils. Unfortunately, although the western Allies, generally behaved responsibly, the Soviets stole what they wanted. Even today, many of those people who lost art to the Germans and then to the Soviets are still waiting for the return of their property. I won't touch on the theft of land and houses by the Communists after the war.",3,0,1,28 November 2014
This Is the End," a good premise spoilt by crudity
","This is a good basic story - some actors (playing themselves) facing the apocalypse occurring while at a house-warming party - but spoilt, in my estimation, by excessive crudity. There are many and lengthy references to sexual acts, graphic phallic symbols, and references to rape, homosexual acts and other things that are totally inappropriate in a mainstream film. Otherwise, the story was actually quite good, and I enjoyed the film. It is a pity that it was spoilt for me by these distractions. The acting was also variable, and I suspect that several of the actors were a little embarrassed to be taking part in this film. I would have preferred to have had a better developed story, better special effects, and a more imaginative ending.",4,1,3,16 March 2014
American Sniper," one of the most polarising movies of the decade
","Though technically well done, this film is one of the most shocking films of the decade. I say not because it isn't well enough made - as a mindless action movie it would be successful enough - but because of its message and the response to it. Americans, by and large, are extolling its virtues, the portrayal of a good American, a patriot. Non-Americans can generally see the broader perspective, and are less positive. It is very unfortunate that Americans who criticize the film are condemned as unpatriotic or radical lefties. The truth of the matter is that I, though a non-American, am socially and politically conservative, yet find the message of the film to be offensive. Good patriotic conservative Americans, as well as those of other persuasions, should also condemn the ideas that the film glorifies. The key messages are that Iraqis are bad and Americans are good, and that it is fine to enjoy killing the baddies. Kyle was a proved fabricator - the law suits by Jesse Ventura are proof of that - but that is beside the point. Boasting of enjoying killing anyone, enemy or not, is a sign of a serious mental disturbance or illness, or at the very least, a sign of the societal sickness in the USA that applauds the 'right' to bear arms, and to use them with wanton abandon. Killing is what war is about, but there have always been limits to such conduct, and the film shows precious little of that restraint. Obviously this is a fictional film, and not necessarily accurate, even allowing for the inaccuracies in Kyle's largely factual book, upon which it is based. But if the common American attitude to Iraqis, Arabs, Muslims and anyone else they see as the enemy, is as shown in this piece of mindless, gung-ho, chauvinist propaganda, then God help us all. Such an attitude can only alienate those who should be the Americans friends and supporters and will ensure that political instability, terrorism and global chaos prevails for generations to come.",2,65,144,22 January 2015
A Quiet Place," Nice little horror
","I enjoyed this simple horror/science fiction movie.There are a couple of reviews which seem to miss a key point, when they remark that the protagonists should not have had a baby (noting that contraception or abortion were options). Another remarked that even New York was in lockdown - presumably from a newspaper heading indicating this. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but things had got a lot worse since the newspaper was published. New York is now most certainly a silent ghost town; contraception made difficult through an absence or severe shortage of medical supplies, and home abortion a bad idea. Apart from a crazed man in the woods, this family may well be the sole survivors for many miles around. They have the advantage that they knew sign language and so could function in a silent world.This is really more of a high-end 'Twilight Zone' or 'Outer Limits' than a full-length feature film, but it handles its material well - and the solid acting helps. The back story is explained through conveniently still readable newspapers. There were a few details which niggled; they were using a huge amount of electricity, with no apparent generator (as generators are extremely noisy I can't imagine them running one anyway). They also had an impressive collection of electronic equipment, including radios and cameras, so presumably the father was some sort of survivalist before everything went bad.Some shocks were too well signposted, such as the demise of the youngest child (well deserved according to my wife!).These minor points aside I enjoyed the film.",9,31,64,5 April 2018
Lincoln," over-rated ponderous paean
","This film is well-made and on a superficial level enjoyable. Day-Lewis as usual dominates and deserves recognition for a great performance. But the weakness of the film - and I believe it is a serious one - is that it is so serious. It is a monumental paean of praise of Lincoln and the amendment abolishing slavery in the United States. There is precious little entertainment value in it.I won't comment on the fact that the practise of slavery was never recognised in English law, and that the slave trade was abolished generations earlier in the British Empire (and it didn't take a bloody civil war to achieve that). Nor will I comment on the excesses of the Federal Government in the so-called Reconstruction Era, which saw the systematic destruction of what remained of the confederate economy and social structures, thereby condemning southerners, both black and white, to generations of poverty. The film does show Lincoln's weakness as well as his vision. As a period piece it is quite successful, though at times it does suffer from the common problem of portraying events through modern eyes.",5,1,4,18 January 2014
Titanic," devoid of a sense of period
","Titanic is a good example of triumph of substance over art, or advertising budget over quality. No doubt it is visually impressive. The story in its broadest outline is a sure winner. But where is the genuine feeling for its period? Characters are made to act as a modern audience might think they would have done in the early part of the last century. Without a sense of period this version could never be a truly great film. It also suffers from utilising stereotypes excessively, from a hostility to the Edwardian upper classes from both America and Britain, and also a poor choice of actor in some of the key roles. The relationship between the two principal characters is also highly improbable in that era - and Rose DeWitt Bukater's slutish behaviour highly unlikely not to mention reprehensible, for a supposedly well- brought up girl.",5,1,2,27 January 2002
WALLÂ·E," excellent movie with something for everyone
","Wall-E is one of the best movies of the decade. It is entertaining, emotional, meaningful and very funny. I liked the fact that there is little dialogue. As the later 'The Artist' reminds us, movies were made without sound for decades, and still managed to convey the full range of emotions etc. The references to other movies were also amusing - I particularly liked the moment when the ship's captain rose to his feet for the first time, to the accompaniment of the theme from 2001 A Space Odyssey, for when the caveman stood for the first time. This is a truly great movie on a number of levels, and enormous fun, as well as being quite serious in its own way.",Null,0,1,29 July 2013
Bruce Almighty," unqualified rubbish
","Doubtless fans of the title actor will disagree, but I couldn't find any redeeming features in this film. What starts with an interesting subject (a man given unlimited powers by God) - if we ignore the far superior 'Man who could work miracles' by HG Wells, which pre-dates this trash by a hundred years - becomes an excuse for 'jokes' and the crudest humor.
But ultimately what disturbed me was that the moral seemed to be that Bruce himself was free to exercise his 'God-given' powers for his own amusement or to better his own life. Is mankind so enfeebled that it never occurs to the character - except in a token and perfunctory moment - to actually do good with his newly acquired omnipotence?",1,17,43,26 September 2003
Annihilation," A major annihilation of a movie
","This is disappointing, though not having read the novel on which it is based I'm not sure how much blame can be laid at the door of the film-makers and how much was due to the original source material. It is true that it is hard to find a really original idea for a movie. A similar idea was done rather more dramatically in 1998 by the BBC in 'Invasion: Earth'. However, there was much to be enjoyed along the way, including some passable special effects and pretty landscapes. Unfortunately the team seemed to think they were on a holiday hike through the benevolent and well-tamed grounds of Windsor Great Park (which indeed they were), rather than roaming through what they should have treated an enemy-occupied, potentially highly hazardous, territory. I half expected them to come face-to-face with a Range Rover driven by HM The Queen.Did anyone else notice the nod to the original source material for an ever-expanding area of mutations, consuming all who pass through it - J. G. Ballard, The Crystal World' (1966), which had a character named Ventress. The leader of the expedition in this film is called Ventress.I fear the film-makers have indeed been constrained by the largely derivative material they were given, but they could have added some rigour to the expedition - perhaps just a little common sense (such as, don't place your sentry in a well-lit hut, so that she stands out like a lighthouse).Overall, I remain ambivalent about this film. It is a pity, since I'm not in the USA, that I only saw this on the small screen thanks to Netflix - I'm sure it would have been better, visually at least, on the big screen, as intended.",Null,6,11,17 March 2018
Contact," over-rated science fiction drama
","I found Contact to be over-rated, and ultimately a failure as science fiction - or indeed any other form of drama. That it not to say that there is not much to enjoy, for there are good segments. But ultimately the film cannot be rated as a success, principally because of the implausibility of the post-mission events. If you haven't seen the film yet don't read further.Spoinlers -Why didn't someone attempt another trip? Why did they say it was all a hoax, simply because the astronaut claimed to have been away for 18 hours, and no one missed her? How could anyone seriously believe a signal from a distant star system could be faked? It is simply pretentiousness to hang the film on religion versus science, and hard facts against instinct/wishes. Without logical plot development the end result is a great disappointment, and a waste of some good potential.",7,1,3,4 August 2001
