It," Stand By Me horror wannabe
",Horror version of 'Stand By Me'. It doesn't have a lot of scary scenes and no disturbing overall feel during the movie. Acting not bad but storywise doesn't even come close to Stand By Me standard. Tries to be a mixture of horror and real life developments but doesn't reach excellence on either count.,5,0,0,29 October 2019
The Fifth Element," One of the best
","For me this is one of those movies that I can watch over and over and never get bored.Multi faceted story, action, comedy, a little romance, change of pace, extraterrestrials, religion, semi robots, outer space. It has everythin in it. Acting great from all involved. It's my favorite Bruce Willis character by far.",9,0,1,10 September 2019
Fargo," Boriiing
","Boring and meaningless. One would like much better if a college kid had gotten a camera and filmed a day in the local life of people living there. Starting with early am visiting a cafeteria, moving on to a local school, visiting local police station talking to policemen, going out on the highwawy filmong traffic, scenery etc.The only good use for this movie is if your a/c is out in a hot steaming summer night, and you can't fall asleep. Put this movie on and close your eyes and the room will slowly cool down and finally you will get to sleep, that's how lifeless, cold and bland this movie is.",2,1,6,29 November 2019
The Thing," Unique horror movie
","Movie is wonderful. Story is good, moves well and keeps you interested all way through. Characters are very interesting and you feel like you know everyone and that each one has his own special place and duties in the movie.Atmosphere is what gives the movie a leg up on many many other movies. Many have commented on that before.I wanted to add that what in my opinion gives this movie a very slight edge over Alien is that it is not as claustrophobic. Not everything is confined inside the buildings all the time. Action steps outside a little which feels like danger is not as controlled and might actually get out of there.Another thing is that since the action happens on Earth, albeit on a very remote place, it seems like horror could have an immediate, quick and devastating effect on the entire population. It feels defenitely more humane and natural than the Alien movie.",10,2,5,22 November 2018
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Well done movie
","Second best X-Men, very close to being as good as first one (originality). Loved the angle of going back in time and seeing the younger version of the heroes.It was good to know what a prick Xavier used to be and how the situation was eventually resolved. Loved the ending of the 'ending' of the movie. There was also plenty of action, drama and some humor with the speedy guy.",9,0,0,7 December 2019
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Could have been much better
","The most interesting thing about this movie was when I learned that the director was the same as Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead. That's unbelievable.Lifeless characters, nothing on the line, confusing and distracting screen throughout.",2,2,8,10 September 2019
No Country for Old Men," Bad movie
","It's like a long, boring religious movie, just there is not even a religion in this movie. I give acting some credit",3,1,4,29 November 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy," Beats all expectations easily
","If there were only two movies ever made, and they were Star Wars and this one, Star Wars would get a 5 and Guardians of the Galaxy would get a 9. But with a sea of movies out there we're talking 10+ here.",10,1,2,29 November 2019
Logan," Logan is
","First X-Men and Days of Future Past are great movies. Logan is another Twilight Zone movie where H. Jackman is Kirsten Stewart sulking, and sobbing throughout till the end. Disgrace part of the whole series.",1,0,0,12 May 2020
How to Train Your Dragon," One of all time best animated movies
","There is only few good animated movies. This is one of them. It has a lot of originality(in my opinion) from animation, scenery, storyline and characters. Even if you happened to not like it at the end, there will definitely be sth in there that you will praise about this one",9,0,0,29 November 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," Love this movie
",Lots of action. Love movies that go back in time and manage to pull that off. Acting by Emily Blunt was beyond impresive. She was extraordinary in my opinion.,9,1,1,28 January 2020
Kong: Skull Island," Good action movie
","I like this movie because it has action, some funny moments and it's not boring. There is a few weak spots on the plot, but no big deal. If they would have put another actor in place of Samuel Jackson this movie easily could have been an 8 in my book.",7,4,5,2 November 2019
The Lion King," Above average to great movie but
","Had to take a star off not for being a copy of another movie/series, that's fine and all, but the underhanded way used of trying to hide that fact.",7,0,3,6 December 2019
RED," movie
","Kind of funny, action. It's not over the top serious movie meaning that in reality events could have gone in very different direction.",9,0,0,21 June 2020
Rear Window," 8 or 9th best Hitchcock movie
","I don't have much expertise on lighting, use of camera, setting etc in movies. Reviews seem to praise technical aspects so I will give 3 stars automatically because of lack of 'expertise' on my part.As far as entertainment movie has quite a lot of dialogue, some interesting and it makes sense, but it gets repetitive and boring eventually.Story seemed predictable but continuity was maintained throughout. No surprises and I would say an weak ending with some holes on executing it.",6,0,1,26 November 2019
