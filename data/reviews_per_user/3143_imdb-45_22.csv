Captain Phillips," Desperately in need of a tripod
","1) Redefines the word 'shaky cam' and I'm not even talking about action scenes. I'm talking about the whole film, even those scenes filmed on land. It seems that all the money went to pay Hanks and they didn't have enough left for a tripod. After the first 4 minutes of this film I needed a brown bag.2) Speaking of brown bag, the opening scene is so stilted and forced, I knew that the rating of this film had to be skewed. And Tom Hanks' accent - what on earth was it? A New England or Boston accent? The word 'suck' does not even do the atrocious attempt justice. Hanks does a good job doing Hanks - that's it. He's not a great actor - just great at his one dimension playing himself.3) The story is based on a true story.... loosely. What makes me positively ill is that this hero tripe is passed off as if it was the real thing, which it isn't and wasn't. But Hollywood needs to have a hero who is greater than life, passing it off as if it was true and that 'based on a true story' means it's basically the truth but a summary of what actually happened.So if you value your time and keeping your food down, this movie may not be for you. It's really not very good and extremely amateurish. But with Hollywood tossing out dreck every month and redoing every prior film, musical, superhero and idea they can get their hands on, even this tripe looks good to the sad masses.",1,16,38,13 April 2014
10 Cloverfield Lane," Suspenseful but amateurish, illogical and pointless
","This seems like a love it or hate it film because of the reveal and ending, which I won't give away. The entire premise of the movie can be summed up in one sentence. Is the strange man who saves the wounded lady an insane psychopath or is he really the brilliant savant who has saved the lady from an unspeakable disaster?Unfortunately to me this film felt like it was designed to prolong answering that question for 100 minutes. I was never into Lost or any other of JJ Abrams TV programs but now I understand his forte. It is in telling stories designed to go on interminably with endless reveals. The problem with this one is that the reveals were sometimes illogical, unnatural and forced. There was a noticeable stilted, awkward manner in which each subplot progresses.One example is a scene with keys. Normally a person who realizes there is a difficult situation abound would wait for an opportune moment that would not invite suspicion. But here a seemingly inopportune time is presented as an opportunity. It's as if Abrams said 'we need a scene with suspense here to prolong the film' and it succeeds in doing only that.From my perspective, this film is just an overly long, pointless tease which is apparently Ambrams' trademark. Goodman plays his part as well as can be expected and there are some amusing moments. The actors do what they can with their roles but it's clear they are following a script, sometimes feeling as though this could have been a stage play. While I've seen worse, this has zero replayability factor because it's a one trick pony and all you want to know is where is this story really going. And like many others, I felt that it really wasn't worth the time investment. If you feel that the film is unrealistic and artificial early on, chances are you'll feel the same way throughout.",5,1,3,19 December 2016
Gravity," Merely a visual spectacle, otherwise pointless and mercifully short
","I'm going to be one of the few to say what horrendous tripe this movie was. Thankfully we saw it in 3D on the big screen. Anything else is a complete waste of time, IMHO. The beginning of the film starts good with an interesting premise. But once things start to go wrong, everything goes wrong with this film. It would be better titled 'Mission Impossible' and it's a very short film that tacks on an additional hour out of what could have been a neat 30 minute film.This won't ruin the film but was one of the funniest lines I heard from the audience, who also felt that this was an empty preposterous story that was as vacuous as space itself. He said 'Let me guess, and here comes the shark!' You'll understand it when you see it and it will probably give you a great laugh since there is no film that Hollywood cannot ruin.",5,7,13,15 December 2013
This Is the End," If this is funny the apocalypse of Hollywood is near
","How many ways can you create the same dumb movie? There isn't much to say about this film that can't be explained as follows: The dumb pot comedy brat pack hang out, sexual and drug related humor ensues as the group starts to riff on each other. Throw in some plot about the end of the world and redemption of your sins. That's the whole movie.If you read the critics' take, every one of them says this is a work of genius. It's so self-indulgent it's terrifying. I'm sure they are laughing hysterically at how they didn't bother to write a script and would just stay in character of themselves and use childish humor and they could force out a few laughs. Yes, there are a couple of funny moments but for an hour and 45 minutes? I've seen worse but this was a horrendous waste of time.",2,75,157,14 July 2013
Green Room," Pointless, stupid. Inaudible. Reviewers connected to film or marketers
","The concept had a good idea. But the script was very poor and a complete waste of a cast with eye catching talent. My guess is that all the positive reviews came from either (a) marketers; (b) people consoling one of the late actors by giving the movie a good review; or (c) living off of a 'cool line' or two; and (d) an easy target to hate. But neither group is particularly likable.1. The sound recording and mix was so terrible I had to watch with subtitles. My hearing is fine. Voices were muffled and conversations (at least from one side) were completely inaudible. Sound levels were uneven and drastic increases and decreases. Read the bad reviews and they will say the same thing. Same goes for the darkness in this film making seeing what is going on impossible.2. The first thing you'd do if you're in the middle of nowhere is to... infuriate dozens of scary looking people in conversation, in song. Do it because you want to provoke your own end or ruin a gig that will pay you money. Why they needed these losers I don't know.3. What started out promising turned incredibly stupid and pointless. It doesn't take a four star general to snuff out a bunch of young people in a room - especially when you've got a big guy with a gun!!! And you've got dozens of men with guns. But no, guns are not a solution. Why? No explanation. But don't worry, they can be if you need the plot less story to move on. The solution devised to 'remove the guns from the equation' was SO illogical and ridiculous it was hard to take the movie seriously from that point.4. Speaking of taking the movie seriously, it's amazing how the common laws of medical science known to everyone just don't seem to apply when you'd most expect them to do so. 5. Bad C movie syndrome. You've got an army at you're disposal and it's always 'send in just 1 or 2 of our dumbest people' and have them act so ineptly that it moves the story on to the next milestone.This was nothing but a long, needlessly drawn out affair.",2,89,201,2 July 2016
Troy," Good, entertaining, Pitt horribly miscast
","When you've got some of the best actors with British accents and suddenly Brad Pitt comes on the scene and tries his go at it with something resembling American Shakespeare, you know it's going to fail miserably. And it does. Put him next to Bana, Peter O'Toole and even Legolas and Pitt sounds like a clown. He does his best but is really miscast.The rest of the cast is fantastic, especially Bana, O'Toole and especially Brian Cox who is positively detestable. Very well done. The fact that there aren't any dull moments for this long behemoth of a movie speaks volumes as to its entertainment value.If you can get past Pitt, this is definitely worth the watch and the production value is extremely high.",7,2,4,21 August 2016
The Hateful Eight," Studio and Quentin must pay to stuff the IMDb Ballot box
","8.1? Looks like the movie studios have spent LOTS of money trying to have people see an 8.1 rating and get people to spend money to see this disaster. This is yet another Tarantino ego film, that's all you ought to know. And it lasts for an eternity. And it is BORING.The first problem is Tarantino's ego and politics getting in the way. Yes Quentin, we know about how much you hate the police and your perceived need to apologize for being white. What a hero Quentin is. Jackson's character isn't likable and is a racist himself - unlike Django. QT seems to have forgotten that Jackson plays just another dirt bag in the film whom Quentin could suck off figuratively. Out of place and ridiculous. The film sucks, literally. You'll see and cringe.In Django you understood the character because he's the oppressed taking revenge on the oppressor. But in this film, we are supposed to like a man who takes revenge on 'white people' as a whole? You'll see what he does, as if it is supposed to be acceptable because it is the civil war. This mentality might work at a black panthers rally or if you're a white person at a KKK rally. But this certainly doesn't fly if you're the average, sensible human being. So QT decides to ram his point home, like it or not.And then there is the extended boring talky dialogue. It works when you have a brilliant Nazi general and the exchange is amusing and in character. It doesn't work when you throw it in YET AGAIN in places where the characters wouldn't speak this way. Same old trick we have seen 1000 times from Quentin, such as a smart talking wagon driving 'dentist' we saw in Django. Been there, done that better.You can see where this is going. Tarantino put together his winning formula: 1. my talky brilliant witty dialogue 2. massive violence 3. outrageous actions 4. I'll have another black hero. But this time, I'm go way overboard to show my contempt for white people in authority and make another statement for the cause.Nice job Quentin. You have created a total self serving dud that only you could sit through and admire yourself. For almost THREE HOURS.",1,56,112,14 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," Watchable, forgettable, Hollywood caramelized drama
","With all the power names in this film it has all the potential to be one of the greatest. And sadly, this watchable and reasonably entertaining film falls incredibly flat on many accounts if you're someone who uses your brain. When a film relies upon a character study and doesn't have lots of action, there needs to be a proper foundation to justify why characters act the way they do - and that clearly wasn't the case here. And the film's attempt to be clever outsmarts itself.In summary, Hanks plays an insurance defense lawyer. He's recruited to be the face of a defense for an alleged Russian spy. The full details of the spy are unfortunately just left for the viewers imagination. There is a complete lack of developing the character other than 'a dispassionate old guy who likes to paint and look like a nice old man' that Tom Hanks finds his heart bleeding after a meeting. There seems no question that the man is guilty. But Tom Hanks decides to go all the way to defend this man and beyond, in spite of being demonized in public as the defender of a traitor. Things get complicated when a US pilot is captured in Russia and an innocent American student as well in Germany.The performances are excellent. There is some witty dialogue and some character study, unquestionably the unrivaled abilities of the Coen brothers. I found the first 1/3 of the film to be the most engaging, by far.But as much as I admire their work, this film has Spielberg shmaltz draped all over it. And this ultimately is what makes this film (a) totally predictable; and (b) overly dramatic to the point of groaning multiple times. I found myself drawn completely outside of the movie when it was clear that these actors were just caricatures and very shallow, cardboard cutouts. The film was cardboard, mostly telling a noble series of events without knowing very much at all about all of the players. There is precious little to understand the true motives of any of the characters. And then there will be repeated one-liners for laughs (I thought the characters would wink at the screen) and moments where you could practically hear the director call for the camera to pan out and admire the actor, transfixed in his expression which makes a bold, iconic statement. (Yeah, I'm guessing it all went down just like that, a dramatic artistic moment.) It's an entertaining film but make no mistake before you decided to go -- this has Hollywood draped all over what you would not expect from a Coen Brothers script. If you can shut down your brain and cheer for American patriotism, you'll very much enjoy the film. But if you're a thinking person who picks up on subtle cues, you may find this a very contrived and predictable work.",6,5,10,29 November 2015
Split," Not surprised the studio reviews come up first
","So the first reviews here were which rated the film are obviously those connected with the film. The torrent of bad reviews that follows are the honest ones. From the start I had a bad feeling about this movie because the intro was so awkward and the dialogue was so cheesy with poor acting.James Macavoy is a very talented and versatile actor. How he was suckered into doing the latest Shyalaman stinker can only be explained by his needing to pay back a favor or someone having a terrible video of James with a farm animal. This film is that bad. The only moments that are somewhat tolerable are when Macavoy is on the screen. He's got by far the most presence and talent and the rest of the cast looks even worse contrasting his performance with theirs.In short, Macavoy plays a mentally ill person with multiple personalities. He kidnaps 2 girls with the assistance of a third who is terrified to act against his wishes, even when she has the ability to just walk away in a public airport. I mentioned this because that is how the film opens. You must buy into the premise in order for the film to even start to work.As the film progresses, it becomes evident early on that Macavoy suffers from this multiple personality disorder and will act out each part. And Shyalaman throws in his usual bit of supernatural rubbish, how such afflictions are also gifts, the savant mentality. OK, great, got it. Begin an hour of torture porn and hints of what bad things might happen. Warning that things will get worse. Heighten tension. Disclose things that don't really add up. Heighten tension. Add more awkward, obviously orchestrated dialogue and directing.Will the girls escape the potentially horrible ending they fear might happen? When will the James Macavoy acting clinic open? Will his accent change? Take Macavoy out of the film and this is a direct to video stinker that no one will remember. Sets a whole new bar of low.",1,66,158,31 March 2017
Now You See Me," An insult to the intelligence
","Movies like James Bond or Jason Bourne ask you to suspend your disbelief to the limits. Movies like this just insult your intelligence insisting we're gullible enough to suspend disbelief to the clearly impossible. And worse, it pretends to preach that the illusions are really possible if you have the skills. This is Hollywood movie execs believing we're all too stupid to know better and that we'll be amazed, not disgusted. Apparently it worked for some of us.In short, a couple of very unlikable, arrogant mentalists and magicians are summoned by an unknown person to carry out the most incredible magic tricks of all, with each show upping the ante. Who is behind this show? What is the ultimate gain as some huge dollar amounts are affected? Will our smarmy mentalists get caught? Unfortunately the tricks are incredible because they just aren't feasible. And the explanations provided and the reveals told as this movie goes on become incredibly insulting in the final third of the movie. And since virtually none of the characters are likable, it's difficult to know whom you hope comes out on top. And in the end, the real magic trick is that you were just separated from a lot of cash for what amounts to a fraud. And they are going to try this trick again in a sequel, so I hear. Fool me once, shame on you...",3,1,3,30 January 2016
American History X," Great start, ultra liberal over the top end
","I'm all about equality, fairness, respect for mankind, yadda yadda yadda. The performances are all very good. But the film really begins to lose all the realism and impact in the final third. Without ruining the film, we go from hard to limp.... very limp. Realism to Hollywood induced moments, where you know the ultra-liberal writers were all yanking each other saying 'oh, this will be a powerful, academy award winning scene.' In the end, Norton's character just isn't believable at all. But what makes it even more flaws is the grand finale, which was disappointing, rushed and forced. It was as if the writers had once again said 'we need to inject academy award winning ending.' And how unfortunate that it just was entirely ridiculous after all that time. And then there was 'the moment' - the academy award winning moment - that only happens in movies. This film gets a 9 for the very powerful first third, an 8 for a solid middle and a 4 for ruining the entire setup of the first two acts.",7,1,5,15 March 2014
Non-Stop," An insult to anyone who has flown a plane
","This is one of those 'only exists in Hollywood' movies. That there are too many people giving this a rating above 5 shows how desperate people have become to get a barely watchable movie. In short, someone creates a situation on the flight which is not even close to possible. And the air marshal must take control of the situation and figure out the who done it.Neesom sleepwalks through the role he's played 10,000 times before and is just cashing on on the 'Taken' series of movies. Every cliché you've ever seen is tossed into this film. Every politically correct red herring is tossed in and is so phony in nature to be embarrassing and thoroughly predictable. And the set up and scheme... airports don't exist like this anywhere. Nor do news reporters get information within 2 minutes.The script devolves into something so stupid that it is not to be believed. When you think that the story line couldn't be stupider and more far-fetched, it takes the script one notch lower. Facts are irrelevant. Implausibility - no big deal, just keep plodding ahead.Woe is the state of our undemanding movie goers, most of whom must never have flown a plane before. Don't say you weren't warned.",1,16,31,23 August 2014
K-19: The Widowmaker," Mediocre film, a sub story done Hollywood style
","I wanted to like this film. Sadly it got off to a bad start when all the actors decided to play fast and loose or not at all with their Russian accent. It was as if they tried to do something at the beginning and then said 'aw... screw it. we aren't fooling anyone' and then dropped the accent entirely most of the time. You can put it behind you eventually but it's a sign about how sloppy this film is made.The premise is that Ford's character is a bit of a bully who will take out of proportion risks and endanger the lives of everyone on board to prove his point. I did not see any resolution between Ford and Neeson's character. And in terms of what plays out that I won't say - I never saw it coming. And that's only because where the film went was not what the prior time led you to believe. In fact, everything pointed in the other direction until it felt like Hollywood stepped in because the script said 'insert turning point here' and then the characters had to pretend as if this was the natural next sequence of events. It wasn't.The special effects are fine and the submarine shots reasonably good. But the repair involved was also ridiculous. It was as almost as if they ran out of budget and would show you the same thing, with everyone having a go at what they were fixing which seemed more like 'designated piece of metal'. OK, we'll get beyond that but it still bears notice as you watch repeated scenes of the same thing as if to convey a sense of emotional impact on certain characters - which I didn't find credible.This is nowhere near Das Boot to feel the tension. And it's not really meant to be. And as a 'based on a true story' it's very, very lightly based on the true story. Most of the acting is fine but the script is a real problem. And I don't think Harrison Ford would have himself cast as anything else but smelling like roses. And that's also disappointing. At no point do I think the conclusion of this film is even remotely foreseeable because the natural flow of the characters and events simply doesn't get you there. It's done solely to keep the audience guessing what happens next and the very artificial Hollywood studios twist makes for a mediocre, phony feeling film that certainly would only stand up for one viewing, at best.",5,1,2,6 May 2017
Ex Machina," Great acting, smart dialogue, horrendous plot holes
","It's unfortunate when a director and writer has a great concept but his conceit is in expecting the audience to suspend their disbelief for items which cannot be dismissed. This includes a genius acting as if his IQ has suddenly plummeted to double digits and asking people to forget what they see every day.Ex Machina is a smart story about a computer programmer who has suddenly won a trip to spend a week with the founder genius of the world's largest search engine (called 'Bluebook' - how is that for laughs?) The mysterious founder is a recluse, and our protagonist is to spend a week with the founder, helping him work on the most advanced device mankind has ever seen. You've all heard about what that is so it's no secret -- it's Ava -- a new form of artificial life that has not been given the famous 'Touring Test' by anyone other than the machine's creator. Is this life? Is it a machine? Other questions crop up as our resident genius seems to have a more ominous side, at least on the surface which is all our protagonist gets to see.So what absolutely obliterates this movie? The director expects the audience to believe two essential aspects of the movie are just present - a 'deus ex machina' if you will. They are simply preposterous. They are: 1. Key card security is all that is needed to protect the most advanced research lab every built. No retina or fingerprint scanning. They don't even need passwords to protect anything - just a keycard.2. Power outages occur for which the generator does not function. Not only does the genius owner not investigate, he doesn't even have the backup power continue to keep his security systems running.Unfortunately these items obviously play a very central role in this movie. While I really enjoyed the acting and some of the dialog, these flaws were impossible to ignore without reducing the movie to laughable, teen fantasy level. While some may debate the ending, which I thought was fine even though it should have gone in a more sensible direction, it doesn't change the fact that your suspension of disbelief has ended long before this comes into play. While I could even buy into the nonsense about gleaning information from search engine searches, make no mistake -- these issues unfortunately will remove this film from being a classic -- although Isaac and Vikander's performances were truly terrific.",5,12,25,26 April 2015
Logan," #51 of all time? ROFLMAO
","The IMDb has become the desert wasteland of the movie studios who flood voting and the haven of our youngest millennials who live to vote for tripe like this, rarely having experienced a good movie or watching anything more than 5-10 years old.This is a very mediocre and predictable X-Men movie dragged out for about 20 minutes too long. The script is weak and unfortunately dumbed down and needlessly mindlessly violent. Without ruining the film... you're going to ask yourself why the young girl doesn't talk. Cheap, exploitative tricks like this and a really rushed, dumb ending (because we need the same Kodak moment in every film) make this a pretty boring, droll drag of a film that is camouflaged in a deeper 'so this is what happens when X-Men get old!' There was nothing deep about it.The lazy script leaves open gaping holes but I won't repeat them as a spoiler. Just be prepared to realize that this is a much lesser film than is being lauded here. People feel they must praise Jackman's departure as well as Stewart. If it wasn't for their excellent acting, this film would have gone quickly to cable.Notable are excellent special effects. I give them credit for seamless visuals. But the violence in this film was gratuitous and stupid, running into the face of danger like Superman. And at the end, after hearing all of this 'we perfected it' rubbish, you'll have to wonder why the movie resembles Highlander. There can only be one. Really? Why is that? Don't kid yourself. This is a watchable film but nothing you'll care to see again. Farewell X-men, you cashed in one last time.",6,6,13,14 March 2017
This Is Spinal Tap," Brilliant. Hilarious. Must have some brains to get all the jokes
","It's funny to read the few comments here such as those saying that 'School of Rock' was a great film about Rock and Roll. That pretty much sums up the limits of some of the viewers, unfortunately.This film is about a genre in Rock and Roll. If you lived through the 70s, 80s or even the early 90s as a teenager or adult, you can related to the perfect satire of this genre. Many of the jokes are so funny and have some basis in a little bit of what makes people well rounded that they may fly right over the head of younger viewers ('I prize the rent from the local Hebrews.')Without a doubt, if you're a musician you will love this film. If you're not a musician you might not get all the jokes but it is still a hilarious, fun ride. It takes you through everything from the political correctness that is 'the entertainment industry' to the image conscious era of 60s/70s rock bands where sexuality reigned supreme.So my guess is that if you're a younger viewer or not at all into the music scene, you may not fully relate. Regardless, this is the movie that started all the mockumentaries and for good reason. The performances are stellar - the actors ARE the band. I enjoyed this film and remember all the lines just because it defined so many great inside jokes of what was. Every cut is hit on this soundtrack.",10,1,4,25 August 2013
Saw," Seven without the wit, style, acting and purpose
","After watching this movie and reading the reviews, it becomes apparent that most of the reviews aren't about brilliance, just fascinated by torture porn. Seven was not at all about the gore, which actually very little of actual shock made it to the screen. It was all visceral, the purpose of a madman trying to teach society a lesson. But what is saw? It's a surprise ending you could possibly detect and the primary reason why so many thought it was brilliant. But the purpose of the movie? You don't appreciate your life. Now I'll torture you until you're near death and you'll appreciate the moments you are awake. That's all you need to know. There are some twists and turns even though there isn't much more than two people locked in a room trying to escape. The part of the film that makes this surprisingly difficult to watch is the terrible acting. Perhaps Cary Elwes was meant to be a sarcastic prince but has no capacity for carrying out any type of horror or range of emotion. The biggest name was the weakest link.Bottom line is this - if you like torture porn, you'll love this. It's what the saw series is, except each installation is even less clever than the original but just features more bizarre torture porn chambers.",1,5,10,10 September 2014
Don't Breathe," Good effort but vastly overrated, stretched out horror flick
","Sadly so many of these noir/horror movies are made with great effort only to be spoiled by a handful of incredibly lame, stupid and lazy plot points. If you blindly accept the lazy setup, the first 2/3 of the film are well crafted before it devolves into a prolonged effort to keep the story going for an extra 20 minutes or else you'd have just a film an hour long.The premise - 3 struggling Detroit 20 somethings rob homes by using alarm codes that are accessible to the father of one of the youths and stolen by the father's son. For some odd reason one of the youths heard that a horrible looking home is where an old army veteran lived who received a large settlement from a car accident lawsuit, which claimed the life of his daughter. Why they are sure that this man, who is supposedly blind, are so damn sure that the cash will be stored in the house and that they will somehow be able to find it and extract it is dubious at best. But let's play along with that scheme.It takes a while for the setup to take place where the trio break into the old man's home to find quite a number of surprises. The first third and the early scenes are well done. The movie moves along at a reasonably quick pace with clichéd characters on the side but they don't really distract from the main attraction. The problems occur when the typical horror film implausibilities begin to take place. And while there is excellent suspense for a good part of the film, it takes the easy way out a number of times which lead to a realistic feeling horror/noir film becoming a bit of a self- parody, which many of them are.Without giving the film away, the typical elements of horror films are there - characters that are almost impossible to kill because they are needed to prolong screen time. Chase scenes that someone allow characters to escape and show multiple views of the same characters with the attacker stuck in the same place for several different angles so that the protagonist can get away, albeit temporarily. It's not so bad at first but when you're at the 60 minute run time, it starts to become very noticeable. And the most disappointing part has to be the ending. It's supposed to provide your typical 'woah' ending but mine was rolling my eyes at the ceiling at this film's way too hard effort to end up in such a fashion. They forced it badly.None of these detriments will ruin at least one view of the film. It's totally forgettable derivative drivel. But the suspenseful moments are well crafted and at least for an hour it will keep you entertained and wondering what will happen next. Could and should have been better. It's a B+ -- and at least it's not another dumb Saw torture porn film. This one is more about suspense.",6,2,7,10 September 2016
1408," Funniest movie I have seen in a long time
","So bad that it's actually hysterical. As someone else wrote, writer decides to challenge the premise that a hotel room is haunted. Suddenly, he must face the fact that weird stuff is going to happen and there is a foreboding of something very bad going to occur to him. Stuff just happens - it doesn't really matter why, just that it's weird and illogical. Cusack looks like his only fear was in agreeing to do this film. The dialog is horrendous - so bad to be hilarious. It's just not worth wasting your life on watching this film, which you'll realize within 20 minutes of the moment you start. The real horror is in seeing the ending credits and realizing you sat through it.",1,1,3,18 August 2013
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Epic terrible. An excuse to have Batman fight Superman
","Because anyone with a brain would see Superman as a villain. If he wasn't there, civilization probably wouldn't exist. Small matter. And then there is the matter of who he saves and how. All of this set up is an excuse to create fabricated animosity against Superman because they need it to set up the big fight. That's what this is all about. Create some childish ridiculous reason to have superheroes fight.Right from the start this is one big confused mess. It's difficult to follow what is going on because it's all substance, no coherent story. Without ruining the movie for you, this is one where brain must be left at the door completely. And even then, whatever grey matter you have left must be turned off. It doesn't have to make sense. Big, weepy philosophical speeches are made to government as if these are earth shattering issues of monumental proportion. Taking itself seriously as if any of these statements are anything more than nonsense in the land of make believe is another downfall of this film. It is as bad as it sounds. High budget production doesn't save this film from being the dumb watch that it is.",1,3,10,9 July 2016
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," As bad as many of the real reviews say
","I'm not a Harry Potter fan and haven't read the books. But I will admit that they did a great job of polishing those films, making the dialogue reasonably natural and the characters show chemistry and depth.The entire Hunger Games films are almost devoid of real emotion. It's almost as though there is BAD and GOOD. Katniss is GOOD. The others in the Games are mostly BAD. None of them seem to be concerned about the impending death that virtually all will face, just acting bad. The dialog seems stilted and what you'd expect from a child's book.Thinking about the logic of the plot and the uprising (whatever that is supposed to mean and we never get a feeling that the poor districts have mounted any sort of problem that the ridiculously wealthy can't handle.The acting is intentionally over the top to show the badness. Stanley Tucci does a fine job, as always, but it's so over the top to be completely absurd. Even The Running Man did a much better job than this.A friend who read the books said that all the characters were written this paper thin. It's as if you must check all brains at the door and do not think about whether anything really makes sense if you give it more than 2 minutes of thought. The Games themselves don't seem to exist except to create a spectacle for the reader or viewer. This is like pitifully bad science fiction that is geared towards 5-7 year old audiences who mostly don't understand things too deeply. This film is a colossal waste of time unless you are a fan of this silly series. If you're renting, make sure you can accomplish something else at the same time so you don't feel like it's a total loss.",1,27,51,7 March 2014
The Island," Michael Bay = All Explosions, No Brains & Plausibility
","Wow... what potential that turned out to be a stinker. The only thing saving this watchable disaster is the fantastic cast and high budget visuals. The stilted and illogical dialogue and incredibly dumb screenplay cannot save this from being a totally forgettable sci fi thriller.The movie starts out promising. Sean Bean is a great actor playing a doctor running a strange facility that raises human beings, training them one day for their release into an uncontaminated Island. McGregor is the curious lead who meets Johansson. Security is laughably lax in this ultra high tech facility, so bad that nobody even notices that McGregor leaves a floor tile blatantly out of place when he sneaks around. How dumb can everyone be?Buscemi plays a completely out of place supervisor. He's got material to fuel McGregor's curiosity that should never even be in the facility. It makes no sense whatsoever. But it's there to unnecessarily further curiosity of our lead.Hounsou is wasted as... I can't tel you. But he sounds like he's reading from a cue card. The dialogue is do awkward and dumb he seems to not believe it himself. Obvious questions are never asked. Obvious next steps are never explored. This is a Michael Bay film. 'Guys.... I need to get from the explosion scene to the car chase and then to the next action sequence. ' That's what this 'intelligent' scifi film devolves into, making it the totally forgettable movie that it is.Don't make the mistake of thinking this film is smart. It has a great premise but the Michael Bay execution sucks and is 'Transformers' does Bladerunner = disaster. If you want totally mindless eye candy with HUGE plot holes (and I mean HUGE), then watch this forgettable film on a cable rerun. That's about the extent of it.",4,0,4,23 August 2014
