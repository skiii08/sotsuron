Whip It," Easiily the best casted movie I have ever seen!
","Every role is perfect!Whip it is the kind of movie that doesn't necessarily have a 'deeper meaning' and the format of the story is pretty predictable but it's so well put together that it doesn't matter. Deeper meaning is not the point of this kind of movie. Entertainment and great atmosphere is. And Whip it does both so amazingly well! I have never seen a movie where all the roles are just perfect. There's not a single thing I'd like to change about this movie. It's funny, it's easy, it's full of wicked chicks and cute indie boys, it's beautifully filmed, brilliantly acted and entertaining all the way through.If you like movies like Dazed & confused, Reality bites, Foxfire, Flakes, Virgin suicides and Girl (which could've been a really good movie but sadly fails to the point where I cringe in it's casting.) and TV-series like Freaks & Geeks and My so called life, then I HIGHLY;) recommend you this movie!",9,1,5,7 May 2010
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Warning: This movie is a mega fail
","This is quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever sat all the way through. Worst meaning; it bored me senseless. I was on the verge of turning it off several times and the only reason I let it keep playing was I somehow hoped it would come alive somewhere in the middle, or three quarters in, or even in the last few minutes. But it just doesn't. Despite having the potential to be a good movie - A girl with rad hair colour, a reasonably OK story line, comic strip captions, indie music and quite a few actors I like, it totally fails to be interesting in any way. In my opinion there are no redeeming qualities about it. None. There are no characters to like. Or dislike. Since the main character is so totally unlikeable, it's impossible to dislike his enemies much and when you don't actually care if the 'evil exes' take him out or not it renders the whole experience simply boring. Besides they don't seem that evil, I don't really know what was evil about them apart from being exes. Scott Pilgrim on the other hand is an utterly awful character, I'm glad he's fictional. I'd like to call him quite a few things but I'm pretty sure IMDb would censor them and not accept this review so I'm leaving them out cos I want to warn others before they waste money and an hour and a half of their lives on this movie. If there is such a category as 'indie B-movie' this is it. Except that 'B-movie' implies it's so bad it's at least funny. This is not even funny. It is the most boring movie I have ever seen all the way through. So if you decide to watch it despite reading this and it turns out you find it boring too during the first 20 minutes, SAVE YOURSELF! TURN IT OFF! You can spend the remaining 1hr 25 minutes doing something way more fun with your life. Cos pretty much ANYTHING will be more fun than watching the rest of this movie. If you're on the other hand aiming for death by boredom - carry on. Scott Pilgrim vs. the world will do the trick. Guaranteed.",1,74,168,6 September 2010
