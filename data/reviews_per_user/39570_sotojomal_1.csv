The Equalizer," poor
","Well I am a very harsh movie critic I knew what to expect from this movie, and my expectations were met which is not a good thing. I think Denzel is a great actor, but this role does not fit him in my opinion. The movie does not have much of a story basically one man goes out and seeks revenge for a wrongdoing that he witnesses. Logic was clearly not applied in this movie the fact that he eliminates targets in a matter of seconds no one can apparently touch this man as well so no suspense is built in that sense. Also many of the characters are very dull not much emotion is evoked by them, and the audience knows very little about them. I think the biggest problem with this film and many other films that follow the same trajectory is that they are bent on the clich√© that the protagonist must always be victorious, but that mold should be broken. Towards the end of this film a Nikolai which in my opinion the actor played this role very well was eliminated in such a fashion that made this movie a dud for me Denzel and this individual were like chess players they knew each other's moves why not end it in a more competitive fashion. There are a multitude of issues I personally have with this movie others may not see it in the same fashion.",1,10,19,30 January 2015
