The New World," Drawn out rubbish
","Well, I saw the film, and was not impressed. Sure, it had some nice scenery, but it didn't have any point to it. The story was tame, it had no important points in any way and it was not entertaining. And finally; If they were going to use the music from Wagners opera Siegfried, they ought to have done it properly, not use a lame plagiarization. I sat there waiting for the music to reveal itself, but in stead it seemed like they'd just cut a short piece of music out of the opera and put it on repeat with ever increasing volume. I was disappointed. I guess I'll always forgive Christian Bale purely because he had a great performance in American Psycho, but thats about it. Don't waste you time or money going to the cinema or video-shop for this one. A right load of bÂ¤(#ocks.",3,1,4,17 April 2006
