Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This Movie Wows the Senses!
","I must admit that I am a Star Wars fan.  Even so, the movie was better than I expected.  The special effects overwhelm the senses.  The landscapes and battle scenes are amazing.  The only other Star Wars movie scene I can compare the effects in this movie to is the remake of the final celebration scenes in the revised Return of the Jedi.The plot is also excellent with many surprises.  The story is solid.  I was especially concerned that the young Anakin would be unrealistic in his abilities.  They used the character well and his abilities are believable.Overall, an excellent film that I will see at least once more.  This film was made to be enjoyed on a big screen.",10,5,7,2 June 1999
