10 Cloverfield Lane," sorry but didn't like it
","Oh man this week there were not a lot of options at the cinema. Oscar movies passed so we were left with a choice between cartoons and this movie.... I wish I had gone for the cartoon movie... Movie starts pretty good.... and actually gets better for a while. The actors are doing a good job, u get comfortable with the characters things are evolving towards some predicted ending. But then things get a little too intense for no real good reason. Almost like they are trying to make an additional point when you already know what's coming. Anyhow, things would have not been that bad if everything had stopped at one particular point (I'm sure u can all figure it out)...but no they had to keep on going and before u know it I felt that I paid a lot of money for a Sci-Fi production. The second star is because it made me laugh....just like a Sci-Fi movie.",2,2,8,12 March 2016
