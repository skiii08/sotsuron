Alien 3," rubbish film full of pointless bad language and cartoon aliens
","SPOILER!!! how i loved the other two movies but who ever wrote this one has a screw loose. OK lets kill all the characters of the other one and THEN! get this Hollywood we kill off S. weaver! BRILLIANT HAVE $100,000! sadly it wasn't such a great idea.This is one of the worst movies I've seen in sci-fi history, its has so much of the word F**K you cant actually know what they are going on about. This is an overrated over advertised movie. The next film was OK though but this movie could have been the best. shame $100,000 wasted...watch Alien + Aliens = Great Films. + maybe Alien 4 if you are desperate.",5,198,210,21 February 2006
Star Trek," The only direction star trek could go
","It's more generic than any star trek movie before, it doesn't break new ground in STAR TREK storytelling because the plot isn't quite as deep as others have been. Forgetting the deepness of the plot we get the first chance to see the startrek universe in all it's glory with spectacular effects and lovely sets. The direction style is brilliant, your sucked into the film very early on, in fact the first scene sucks you in and doesn't let you go after. This has never been achieved in any star trek film before now except maybe first contact but again wasn't half as intense as this. You look at where startrek has taken us with all the series and movies, basically JJ Abrams looked at it all and decided to give more of what you wanted which is action and for startrek to be given the full money treatment. He succeeded in making a greatly entertaining and pleasure to watch film. You will find startrek fans who see the original startrek for how it was and aren't open to the slightest of style change, you will probably find the film hard to stomach. This is because the fact is after Nemesis (which i liked btw) there was no where else to go with the TNG crew, and basically all the series have had long runs and what else could be done? I think what this movie has achieved is showing not only a general audience these wonderful original series characters but because of the new cast gives the chance of fans to see new sides of the crew, a prequel was definitely the way to go and with the curse of sci-fi prequels always failing startrek had a difficult job but they did it, this is the best prequel I've ever seen which didn't suck in a way which upsets and ruins franchises. This is because the people who made this film cared, when you watch this film you see care and time that has been put into making it right.The cast, they were all brilliant. Kirk won't win you over at first, basically he has to grow into becoming Kirk which by the end he does. Spock is fantastic, Quinto brought Spock new levels of character and has made him into an even more interesting character than ever before. McCoy was almost like the original and this is perfect, McCoy was by far capturing the original spirit of the character to the full. The rest were likable and great to watch, well casted. Only thing I'd also say is you have to get used to Chekov's ULTRA thick Russian accent, i kinda laughed a little when i first heard it but once your used to it he's good too.Going back to the plot, it is rather linier in it's design but the clever thing about it is how it manages to make the film fit in with canon.In conclusion it's a startrek movie for everyone go and see it, enjoy it and save picking holes for later, Star Trek is back and it's wonderful!",10,1,9,27 May 2009
Saving Private Ryan," A War Masterpiece from Spielberg
","The beach scene was gory and the most realistic any war movie has been, it captures the ultimate horrors of war. The story maybe a little silly but anyway forget about that this is an extraordinary war film full of thrills and surprises. Excellent scenes of battle Tom Hanks acts his very best in this.This film can be disturbing to some, but this is a must have for war film lovers. The accuracy of the film is great to the uniforms to the guns and the tanks! I love this film and have watched it many times and it never gets boring for me.Ideas: 9.0 Effects: 9.3 Acting: 9.1 story: 5.0 OVERALL: 9.9",10,2,3,4 March 2006
Transformers," Wow, that was a nice surprise.
","With such a high rating on IMDb and the promising advert I just had to go and see this. Expecting it to be a cheap remake of the cartoon I found it a lot different. In a good way! Reasons why to see this: <ul><li>The best visual effects this summer.</li></ul><ul><li>The best humour in an action movie.</li></ul><ul><li>Giant robots! - Fast and fun! Reasons not: - Slightly cheesy.</li></ul><ul><li>Maybe a little to action sequence orientated for some.</li></ul>As you can see the reasons to see it out way the reasons not, so see this movie. Highly Recommended.",10,3,5,21 July 2007
8 Mile," Eminem is multi talented.
","Not only a successful rapper but he also got a bit of Tom Hanks also, meaning he can act! Wow! I thought this movie would be the worst junk ever, I've seen other rappers films they were terrible. But this is different, or it may also help that Eminem has a good supporting cast. Well the movie itself is a mixture of rap battles, street life and plenty of the F word. Overall the film story revolves around Eminem who plays a rap chap who battles other rap chaps. So its the plot of him doing his rap stuff with his 'Homies' in other words his friends. I would recommend this film to all Eminem fans and others who like Rap like Doc Dre etc. Only down side its boring after you have watched once through so don't buy the DVD unless you love Eminem.",7,3,6,10 December 2006
Black Hawk Down," Just Behind Saving Prvate Ryan GOOD MOVIE!
","Lover of great, long battle scenes will love this movie. Directed by good old alien director Ridly Scott does his work again in this one. Realism is what this movie captures, from the helicopters to the guns the accuracy is flawless.This an all time favourite that you watch over and over not quite saving private Ryan standards but its one hell of a movie.Acting in this movie is also good all of the cast give solid performances. The movie does contain some gory scenes of violence so be warned it could make you sick! But anyway watch it! Ideas: 7.0 Effects: 8.9 Acting: 8.8 Story: 6.8 OVERALL: 9.1",10,0,1,4 March 2006
Saints and Soldiers," Brilliant and a new scope for low budget movies.
","After watching this movie, and then looking up what budget it had i realized what an extraordinary achievement it was. The director managed to recreate the battle of buldge pretty well. The snow, vechles, uniforms and weapons are all accurate and correct. The story is pretty good aswel, even though the film is short you still have enough time to get to know the characters a bit. The special effects were brilliant and the scenes well timed.In conclusion this movie may no have had to huge budget of Saving Ryan or the big name cast of Black Hawk Down but its certainly earned its place with the top class WW2 movies. The less detailed gore is in this movie an asset to it, since your not overwhelmed by gore and blood. This gives you a nice chance to focus on the characters and story. Over all 10/10. Recommend it to anyone who loves war and action.",10,1,4,8 February 2007
