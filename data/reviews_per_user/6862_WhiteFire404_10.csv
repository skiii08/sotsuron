Blade Runner 2049," Blade Runner: 2049 - Review
","The first Blade Runner film is a flawed master piece, a movie that while has glaring flaws, they are small compared by all the good stuff, Blade Runner: 2049 is in my opinion, a near perfect master piece. I have to say I consider both films to be as good overall, but there is no denying that Blade Runner: 2049 is a more solidly crafted film, Denis Villeneuve's directing is immaculate and Deakins' cinematography is one of the best works in his entire career (And that's really saying something), so many scenes in this film made my jaw drop consistently because of how beautiful they looked, the pacing while slow, is actually consistent and gives the film a solid tone and I feel here the pacing is more consistent that it was in the first film, Ryan Gosling was amazing in this film, one of his best performances and Harrison Ford once again was fantastic as Deckard, the writing is also really good. Now there are two flaws in the film, one is not a big flaw, in fact, is not a flaw at all, is just weaker compared to the first film and that's the music, Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch both composed a fantastic score but that unfortunately pales compared to the classic original score, the second flaw is a bigger one, but like the first film, it doesn't overcomes the good things, and that's Jared Leto, he isn't really bad, is just that he doesn't really... does anything, you could put literally ANY actor and it would make no difference, I'm not sure if this is because of Leto or just his character, but like I said, is a small problem, specially compared to how much the movie does right. I strongly feel Blade Runner: 2049 will inspire future filmmakers the same way the original film did back in 1982, and if they decide to make a third film, I will eagerly wait for it.",9,1,7,19 October 2017
Unbreakable," Unbreakable - Review
","This is a movie that I enjoyed the first time I saw but with each viewing my love for it started to grow, and now is one of my all time favorite movies. Nowadays more and more people whenever someone asks them what is their favorite M. Night film, they either respond with The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable and this shouldn't be surprising, this is truly one of his greatest works, the directing is amazing and the cinematography is just gorgeous, Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson, both delivered excellent performances and they're characters were very interesting, specially Jackson's character, Mr. Glass, also, James Newton Howard's score for this film is in my opinion the best work he has ever done, specially the Orange Man cue. The story of this movie is also really good, it tells a very human and realistic story of a man who has powers, this is not your average super hero story, this is in every way very different and very unconventional. Unbreakable is a movie that deserves more attention and it seems like is finally getting it.",9,4,6,28 August 2017
Man of Steel," Man of Steel - Review
","Admittedly I never was a very big fan of Superman, but I was actually pretty excited for this movie when it was announced, I though the idea of a modern take on the character could be an interesting idea and when DC announced this was going to be the starting point of their own cinematic universe, I had more reasons to be excited. When the movie came out, initially I had... mixed feelings, on one hand I liked the modern take on the story, on the other hand I feel Snyder scarified some of Superman's best known attributes, after watching the film at least 3 times now, I can say I enjoy more than I did when it first came out, Man of Steel is not a bad movie, in fact is pretty entertaining, like I said, the movie's new story is great, a pretty good modern re-imagining of the character, Hans Zimmer score is magnificent, Henry Cavil was a pretty good choice for the last son of Krypton, in fact, most of the cast is pretty great and the action scenes are great, we never saw Superman fighting like this before on the big screen, however, the film still has some glaring flaws, for starters, the third act, no, I'm not going to complain about the destruction (That argument is just... overdone), but I do think the final battle could have been... maybe 15 minutes shorter or so, also I never liked Snyder's color palettes, I get he is trying to make a more gritty Superman movie but seriously, is just kinda silly how it seems like the sun never touches Metropolis, specially since Superman gets his powers from... you know, the sun. Overall Man of Steel is still a pretty enjoyable movie, the did a good job modernizing the story and we saw Superman fighting on the big screen, however the overlong final battle and the color palettes of the movie are a few complains that hold the movie a bit from being amazing in my opinion.",7,0,1,4 December 2017
Split," Split - Review
","After a while, M. Night's career seemed to go nowhere, after The Village he was making terrible movie after terrible movie, The Visit was OK but in my opinion Split was his return. This is definitely the best movie M. Night has done since Unbreakable and Signs and I'm very glad, this is a really good film, it has a good sense of tension and claustrophobia, and this is achieved thanks to it's solid directing and excellent cinematography, not to mention the performances as well, Anya Taylor-Joy did a fantastic job in this film and her character was one of the most interesting in the movie, James McAvoy was amazing as Kevin, one of the best performances he has ever done, the musical score is also great, is very subtle and sometimes it gets really eerie and creepy. I also like the story and themes that this movie deals with and it makes it more interesting. Now the next things I'm going to say are big spoilers so, be warned.SPOILERSBy far what surprised me the most was the twist ending, when a certain song started to play I was like 'No... way...' and then, when i saw Bruce Willis, and I hear people talking about none other than Mr Glass (Samuel L. Jackson) I knew this film was within the same universe as the movie Unbreakable, and the smile I had because of this stayed on my face for a few days, Unbreakable is one of my favorite movies and to think that we'll finally get a sequel, so many years later, is enough to excite me, I can't wait to see where M. Night will take this series next.",9,0,3,29 August 2017
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Rise of the Planet of the Apes - Review
","Back in 2011 I remember when I saw the teaser for this movie in the theater, I actually got a bit excited, the original Planet of the Apes movie from 1968 was a sci-fi master piece and while the 2001 reboot was disappointing to say the least, the cast and filmmakers behind this project gave me enough confidence to be a bit excited for it. The movie was definitely a pleasant surprise, something this movie did right was going back to the more though provoking ideas that made the franchise famous to begin with, instead of focusing on the action, this movie has a lot of themes of humans using science to play god and the consequences that come with that, and is all handled really well. Andy Serkis delivered an amazing performance, definitely one of the best in his entire career, James Franco and Freida Pinto also did a good job, though I feel the script didn't gave them much to be as memorable as Caesar. Also I feel that Rupert Wyatt's directing in this movie is a bit underrated, true, it isn't as stunning as Reeves' directing in the next two films, but Wyatt did an excellent job giving this movie a slick and beautiful look. The third act, is also just great, that is where the action starts and is done really well and is a good glimpse of what is to come later in the franchise. This is both a reboot and a prequel done right and it has become one of the greatest trilogies of all time and people should always give credit to the one that started it all.",8,1,3,22 August 2017
The Artist," The Artist - Review
","Every person who is obsessed with movies and filmmaking has that one movie that made them interested in the medium, and for me, that film was The Artist. The film came out in 2011 and it was a black and white silent film, the same way movies were used to be back in the 20's and 30's, in fact, the film takes place in the final days of silent movies when the talkies started to rise, which is how they used to call movies with voice audio, the film is about a famous actor of the silent era and his downfall when this films slowly disappear, and we also see the rise of a young actress in the talkies era and a big part of the film is the relationship that forms between this two and how it changes through the years, what I love about this film is that it feels so much as a love letter to Hollywood and filmmaking in general, even though it was released on 2011, it feels like a piece of cinematic history. The acting is across the board excellent, everyone does an excellent job in convening emotion without saying words and this also comes from excellent direction, you can tell the director really love the medium, the music is also great, it really captures the style of the era is representing. Something that should be noted is that I never felt the movie was slow or boring, I felt constantly entertained, there was always so much movement in every shot, which makes sense considering this was a silent film, this is something very, VERY few people are familiar with nowadays but the pacing felt just right, there isn't really a scene that drags in my opinion. Overall the film is just fantastic and I can't really find much wrong with it, this is the film that awoke my interest in filmmaking and made me start to appreciate films in a way I didn't even considered before.",9,2,5,7 November 2017
Wonder Woman," Wonder Woman - Review
","Ever since the DCEU started, I wanted to see a truly great film from them and I think we finally got it. This film represents what I always loved about DC, at their best, they are capable of telling some of the most inspiring and epic stories and this is definitely one of them, Gal Gadot was excellent as Wonder Woman, she sold not just her strength but also her kindness and also Chris Pine was fantastic in this movie as Steve Trevor, also Rupert Gregson-Williams' score is amazing, while some could say he had the advantage of already having the theme from BvS composed by Junkie XL, Rupert added more amazing themes in this film, Patty Jenkins also did a great job directing this movie, specially the action scenes, No Man's Land is by far my favorite scene of the entire film, seeing Diana wanting to fight just to save innocent lives, is just, it really gives a sense of hope from her character. My only complain is really the villains, I really felt they were underused and I wish they could have been better. While Wonder Woman doesn't hit the extreme heights of movies like The Dark Knight, is still up there with Iron Man and the original Superman movies, this is one of the best movies DC has done in years and is definitely the best movie in the DCEU, this film reminded why I love DC in the first place.",8,11,23,6 September 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice - Review
","This is a movie that fans like myself waited since... well, almost our entire lives, the idea of DC's greatest heroes showing up on the same movie seemed like an impossible dream back in the day, but thanks to the MCU, DC finally decided to give it a shot. Now, just like MoS, I have to say, this isn't a bad movie, specially not a 26% movie like RT thinks, this film has plenty of good and even great things, but it does have many flaws, first the good, the cinematography, Larry Fong is an excellent cinematographer and some of his best works are with Zack Snyder, and this is no exception, Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL once again did an amazing job with the score, Ben Affleck was amazing as Batman and most of his scenes were fantastic, specially his first introduction and the warehouse fight, once again the story here seems great, however, what holds it down... is the script, yeah, we start with the bad here, the script is by far the biggest problem with the movie, some dialogues don't make sense, even after I re-watched this film 4 times now, and character motivations and actions are either unclear or... kinda silly, I really feel that DC should have hired someone else to write the script, David S. Goyer has not done a good movie in years now, also the villains... oh boy, I didn't hated Jesse Eisenberg when he was announced and I was even willing to give him the benefit of the doubt... but man, his performance did not worked for me, also... this part, spoiler alert... I guess? Doomsday, he is my favorite Superman villain, he has been ever since I read Death of Superman, and he was just underwhelming to say the least... BvS is not bad like some people would make you believe, but I can't deny this was a wasted opportunity, this is Superman and Batman first time together on the big screen, a better script and better handling of the villains and this could have been something truly amazing.",6,2,3,4 December 2017
Blade Runner," Blade Runner - Review
","This is a film that took me at least 3 viewings to fully appreciate (Like most people apparently), now is one of my favorite films of all time. Blade Runner is in every way, a flawed master pieces, a film that has problems that everyone overlooks because of how good the film itself is, the visuals are by far the stand out of the movie, they still look outstanding, so many years later, and the special effects have barely aged for the most part, the environments were definitely something unique for their time and you can see how they became an influence for so many films of the genre that came after it,the world feels alive, real and it's an amazing achievement, the directing by Ridley Scott is one of the best I have seen in his entire career and the musical score by Vangelis is fantastic and the script is excellent, the story while pretty straightforward, there are so many details that requires you to pay attention to fully understand what is happening or in some cases, what might be happening, Harrison Ford also delivers in my opinion one of the best performances of his career, through the entire film i didn't saw Ford, I saw Deckard. The film has flaws that lie mostly in some scenes that do drag a bit too much and some plot elements here and there that could either be shorten or skipped entirely, but like I said, those flaws are overcome by everything the film does right and that's why Blade Runner is to this day considered a master piece.",9,3,6,19 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Star Wars: A New Hope - Review
","This is a movie that I hardly have anything to say that hasn't been said before, this is probably the most well known movie in the world, most people have seen it or at the very least heard of it, it's a film that changed the industry as we know it, and that isn't an understatement, this and Jaws pretty much invented the blockbuster, something we are very familiar nowadays but back then it was unheard of.
Now, I love this film, however I can't consider myself a HUGE SW fan like other people, yes I have seen all the movies, played plenty of games and even saw some of the TV series, but I have not seen any comic or book from the Expanded Universe and while I love Star Wars, I don't hold it as this 'absolute flawless god-like master piece' but more like a great franchise, with highs and lows and that have given me a lot of enjoyment through the years, A New Hope or as it was called back when it first came out 'Star Wars', was the beginning of this franchise, back when George Lucas was a small name in the industry, the movie is great, however it does have a few problems, but they can be easily overlooked considering both the time the movie came out and the tons of problems it had behind cameras, the movie has a simple story, a Princess kidnapped by an evil empire and the hero with a sword has to rescue her, it's a pretty standard journey of the hero story, but it actually works really good in this film, the characters are all memorable, they started with flaws but you see their evolution through this film and even through the series, the music.... what can I say here? Is arguably the most iconic movie score of all time, Williams created a musical master piece that people love to this day, I guess the only complains you could pick are the light saber between Obi Wan and Vader, which has aged quite a bit, but again, knowing the amount of problems the film had behind the scenes, you kinda have to forgive it. There isn't much I can say about this film because... everyone has already said it, this is a film that inspired many people and remains one of the most iconic franchises of all time and with good reason",9,0,0,19 December 2017
