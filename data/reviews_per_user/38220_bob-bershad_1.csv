Hereditary," Overhyped and overlong
",It's like Rosemary's Baby but not as tight and far less coherent. The movie maker was going for a slow burn but I slowly began to feel burned for paying admission as the flick unfolded. That it reportedly wowed a film festival audience was the first sign of trouble. That someone hailed it as 'the Excorcist of this generation' was the second sign. All the acting was great. The set design and cinematography were excellent. Loved the creepy house. But nobody QCed the script. The writer and director were the same person. That was the third sign. Unchecked artistic self-indulgence. I ignored the signs and went anyway. Don't you do the same.,5,14,36,9 June 2018
