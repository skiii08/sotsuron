Deja Vu," Pure adrenaline rush ! Better than MI III which was the best of 3
","One of the best action movies I have seen. A roller coaster ride from start to finish, and --in the end-- you are still not sure of what was reality and what not.Don't bother with nay-sayers about a 'hypothetical or impossible and impractical ' set up. If you saw 'Flatliners' (and you should have) anything like this is actually possible.Denzel Washington may be the best working actor. I have seen him in absolute drama and action and he excels in both.DO NOT MISS THIS BECAUSE SOMEONE WHO FANCIES IS PROSE MORE THAN A GOOD MOVIE FINDS A REASON TO DOUBT IT. Possibly the best pure entertainment movie of the year !!",9,0,1,23 December 2006
National Treasure," National Treasure
","This is a great and entertaining adventure movie, despite the NY Times critic and others. I think critics write to amuse themselves, not to critique a movie on its main importance 'entertainment'.This movie has been called preposterous and unlikely. Hmmm? I don't suppose the critics liked 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' or 'The Bourne Identity' or 'Independence Day' or 'The Sum of All Fears' or for that matter, 'Titanic ' ! This treasure hunter story, backed up by allusion to national history is fun to watch and fun to think about. The acting is just enough off edge and the dialog and commentary is just right so that it appeals to both adults and children. Disney got it right again.GO SEE IT ! Or rent or buy the DVD, its a keeper for when you can't find something decent to watch. Put it alongside 'Pirates of the Caribbean'........also preposterous but great fun ! We loved it and feel sorry for critics who think movies have to be of great social significance or import to be 'great entertainment'.Joe Turner Illini News Service",9,8,9,19 June 2005
