The Avengers," One of the Best Superhero Movies Ever
","The Avengers is easily the best Marvel Cinematic Universe film to date. I would even go as far as to say that it is the best Marvel film to date. It was an amazing movie, filled with great special effects, and an AMAZING cast.The movie opens, and a voice is describing a powerful object known as the Tesseract. We later learn that this is an Infinity Stone, one of the most powerful items in the universe. We then see Nick Fury and Dr. Erik Selvig talking about how the Tesseract is 'misbehaving,' which is not a good sign. They believe that it is a portal to the other side of space, and think that someone is messing with the portal on the other end, which was suggested by Hawkeye, a SHIELD agent. Out of nowhere, the notorious Loki appears through the portal, and kills multiple agents. He then takes Selvig and Hawkeye as mind slaves, and escapes with the Tesseract. A few people try to stop him, but they are unsuccessful. He escapes, and the title of the movie is announced. After this sequence, the movie goes on to Nick Fury assembling a team entitled The Avengers, and they must learn a way to work together in order to thwart Loki's scheme and save the world from an alien race called the Chitauri.This movie is AMAZING. It includes one of the biggest casts in cinematic history, and mind blowing visuals. Just to give an idea of how big the cast is, let me give you a list: Robert Downey, Jr. (as Iron Man) Chris Evans (as Captain America) Mark Ruffalo (as Hulk) Scarlett Johansson (as Black Widow) Chris Hemsworth (as Thor) Jeremy Renner (as Hawkeye) Tom Hiddleston (as Loki) Gwyneth Paltrow (as Pepper) Stellan Skarsgard (as Dr. Erik Selvig) and Samuel L. Jackson (as Nick Fury)Yeah, that's a lot. Now anyways, this movie has many ups, and few downs. To start, the visuals are amazing in the film. There isn't a moment where you might say 'fake.' All of it looks completely real. These visuals are at their peak in the final battle, known as the 'Battle of New York.' In said scene, Earth is being attacked by a species of alien called the Chitauri through a portal. The portal is positioned in the sky, directly above Stark Tower. There are giant monsters flying out of the portal, and superheroes clashing with them. This scene looks completely real. I felt as if I was in New York and was being attacked by aliens. That's just how good and immersive the film was.The second topic I'd like to hit would be the cast/acting. The acting was amazing. As listed above, the movie has a huge star cast; all of them being great actors/actresses. The script also allowed for the characters to act different than from what they normally do (i.e., Captain America antagonizes others, Hulk doesn't like to get involved in fights, etc.). These varieties of personalities are executed perfectly by the cast.Now that I have covered the main positives, let's go over some negatives. The main problem I had with this movie is the time spent getting the Avengers to be...well...The Avengers. I feel that if Marvel wanted a more accurate title, they should have called it 'Assembling the Avengers.' Throughout most of the film, Nick Fury and Phil Coulson are trying to get the Avengers to work together as a team. They finally do agree to work together, but only after Phil Coulson, also know as the 'glue of the MCU,' gets killed by Loki before the final battle goes down. At that point, we are an hour and thirty minutes into the movie, and have been ready for some good action for awhile, despite there have already been an epic fight between Iron Man and Thor.Other than that, however, there weren't any negatives. This movie obviously has more yes's than no's. Overall, I would give this movie an A+, or a 10 out of 10.",10,0,1,27 January 2016
Alien 3," Not Really That Bad, Just Very Mediocre
","Alien 3 is directed by David Fincher and is a direct continuation of Aliens (1986). In this installment, Ripley, Newt, and Hicks have crash landed on Fiorina 161, a planet with nothing but prisoners on it. However, things take a dark twist when they find that an alien was aboard their ship when they landed, and it's now on the planet with them.Most people hate Alien 3, but I actually enjoyed it overall. It had issues, yes, but they weren't completely abundant, and it had a lot of good aspects to it as well. Alien 3 isn't as good as it's previous installments, but it isn't bad either. The script and acting were both really good, and most characters were likable. Even the ones that weren't likable were written that way, so it didn't affect the film negatively.The acting all throughout Alien 3 was actually really good. Sigourney Weaver once again kills it as Ellen Ripley, the awesome alien survivor. Charles S. Dutton was actually really good as Dillon, the preacher with a bad past. His character was very well rounded, and the script portrayed him as a peacekeeper, which Dutton played very nicely. Charles Dance was pretty good as Clemens, the nice guy out of all of the prisoners. He was the only character with a soft side to him, and Dance showed this very well through his acting abilities.The direction, by David Fincher, is good, but also bad in a sense. Although no quick cuts or shaky cam is present, and the overall direction is good, the film is very dark, and depressing, much like most Fincher films. Although Alien 3's direction isn't necessarily bad, the overall tone of the film was more of a David Fincher feel than an Alien feel. At times, I would use the word boring to describe the tone of the movie. The entire planet is dark, and disgusting, and I just wanted out of it.The script is very well written. All of the dialogue was written and performed very nicely, and brought a great aspect to Alien 3. All of the actors performed their lines very well, and no bad acting was to be found. The pacing of Alien 3 is also pretty strong. Although the grimness of the film is slightly boring, once the story picks up, it really picks up. There were moments when I was on the edge of my seat, and was afraid for the characters' lives, which is a great job on the flimmakers' parts. The eerie direction may have taken away from this feel a little bit, but not enough to ruin an overall good film.Now, my main problem with Alien 3 is the special effects. When practical effects are used, it's mostly just up close, and it looks great, just like the prior two Alien films. The grotesque alien faces are well crafted, and look perfectly fine. However, the CGI is awful. Alien 3 honestly contains some of the worst CGI I've ever seen in a movie. Every shot of a CG alien crawling along the walls, or on the ceiling, looks horrible, and almost as if a middle schooler used a cheap camera and editing software to create the effects.Overall, Alien 3 is a pretty good movie. The characters are likable with good actors behind them, and the script is great as well. Gloomy direction and terrible CGI definitely weren't enough to drag this pretty good film down.",7,2,6,9 May 2016
The Incredible Hulk," Not Very Rewatchable, But Not Nessesarily Bad Either
","The Incredible Hulk is directed by Louis Leterrier and stars Edward Norton as Bruce Banner, a scientist with a secret on the run from the U.S. government. His secret - every time he gets angry, he transforms into a giant, green monster he has nicknamed the 'hulk.' Once the government catches up with him, he faces a mercenary that fears nothing, not even the incredible hulk.To jump right in, this movie isn't great. It's not even particularly good. However, it isn't bad. This movie is not bad in any means, but it's extremely boring. It's hard to sit through the two hour run time of this film, and believe me, I just did it. The Hulk shows up only four times throughout the entire movie, and one of them isn't even a fight scene. Some films can have little to no action, and still be really good, but this movie is about the incredible hulk, so it should have quite a bit more action.The directing is fine, and so is the acting. Ed Norton definitely doesn't do his best in this movie, although he doesn't do necessarily bad. Liv Tyler doesn't do great either, and neither does Tim Roth. The only performance that actually seemed fairly good was that of William Hurt as general Thunderbolt Ross. He's returning in Captain America: Civil War (2016), which I'm somewhat happy about.The absolute worst thing about this movie is the CGI. The special effects throughout the film, especially during the final fight scene between the Hulk and the Abomination. Most of the CG is plain horrendous. Every time the Hulk shows up, the viewer is completely taken out of the movie. This is also true for the Abomination. Every time he shows up on screen, the film looks fake, and pulls the audience out.The last thing I'll mention is the rewatchability, because I've covered everything else so far. Like mentioned above, the film is very boring, and has about 20% rewatchability. There is rarely any time that I will just want to pop in The Incredible Hulk for a fun time. Maybe, if I'm in the mood to have a somewhat of a destructive movie on while doing something else, I might put this on. However, other than that specific situation, I won't be putting this movie on too much.Overall, The Incredible Hulk is a decent movie, with okay acting and all right direction. The film is littered with bad CGI, and some indecent plot structure. The Incredible Hulk deserves a B-, or a 7 out of 10.",6,0,1,6 March 2016
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," One of the Greatest Coming of Age Stories Ever Put To Film
","The Perks of Being a Wallflower is directed by Stephen Chbosky and is based on his best selling book of the same title. The story follows Charlie (Logan Lerman), a wallflower, or someone who always watches his life take place all while on the sidelines, as he enters his freshmen year of high school. He's always been socially awkward, having no friends and nobody that really cares about him besides his family. That is, before he meets two seniors, Sam (Emma Watson), a cool, rock and roll loving girl, and her stepbrother Patrick (Ezra Miller), a funny guy that makes fun of teachers rather than the freshmen. These two seniors take him in, and this is when Charlie finally begins to live his life for himself, rather than just watching it happen.This film is very underrated in my opinion. Most critics liked it, but it doesn't seem to get the attention that I feel it deserves. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is truly one of the best coming of age movies of all time. I would even go as far as to compare it to films such as The Breakfast Club (1985) or Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986). This film covers all types of people, from shy, to outgoing, to smart, to 'cool,' to just about everything. Anybody, I feel, can relate to this movie in one way or another. Whether it be family issues, social issues, or just not having too many friends, anybody can make a personal connection.Stephen Chbosky is an author, yet his work with the camera is very impressive. Although it's nothing to fanboy over, it's very far from bad. No camera angle looks sketchy, and all of the wide shots, mostly of the city scape, is directed very well. Although there's no action involved with Perks, there's a couple upbeat scenes, and the camera captures the enthusiasm very well. I was rather impressed seeing better directing coming from an author than many famous directors can achieve (cough, Michael Bay).The acting is also very nice. Logan Lerman does great as Charlie, especially with the dark background he comes from. Without spoiling anything, there are things in Charlie's childhood that he's not fond of, and he has a hard time dealing with them. Lerman portrays this character amazingly, and it surprises me that this guy hasn't gotten more roles. Seriously, Logan Lerman is a very underrated actor, and that may be due to some of his past films, such as The Lightning Thief (2010). Ezra Miller did fine. He didn't really bring anything too exciting to his role, but it's not like he did bad. He definitely embodied his character, Patrick, pretty well. Emma Watson did amazing as Sam, showing that she's not just the little girl from the Harry Potter franchise. She can really own other roles, much like she did this one. Her casting choice was absolutely a good one.The last positive I'd like to mention with The Perks of Being a Wallflower is the overall theme. The theme, simply stated, is that anybody can be anything. No matter where you come from, or who you are, you can be whoever you want to be. Many other films have given off this same tone, and are considered some of the greats. Perks also realizes this theme, and pulls it off magnificently, thanks to its characters, directing, and amazing plot. Although this movie is based off of a book, it feels very original, and that's probably due to the author of the book directing the film. That's one big thing this movie has in its corner.Now, the only bad quality identifiable throughout this movie is how the film skips around a bit. There are multiple subplots in Perks, but that's not where my issue lies. My problem is how the movie will focus on one of said subplots for a while, and then just jump to a different one, without warning or too smooth of a transition. This could've been fixed easily, just by grinding out the edges of the transitional scenes, and making the switch to the next subject not so jumpy. Like I mentioned, very nitpicky, but it's there.Overall, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of the greatest coming of age films of all time, and really deserves more credit than it usually receives. I'm going to give The Perks of Being a Wallflower an A-, or a 9 out of 10.",9,1,3,16 March 2016
10 Cloverfield Lane," A Near Perfect Thriller, However Not Like It's Predecessor
","10 Cloverfield Lane is directed Dan Trachtenberg, this being his first film, and stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Michelle, a woman who gets into a massive car accident when leaving her fiancé, and wakes up chained to a wall in an underground bomb shelter. Her captor, or possible savior, is a man named Howard, played excellently by John Goodman, who claims there has been an apocalypse, and that the outside air isn't breathable, so she must stay underground. Also in the shelter is a man named Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.), who also claims there was an end to the world, however he isn't too sure of what's true. Together, Michelle and Emmett must figure out if there was an Armageddon, and, if not, how to escape the madman that has imprisoned them.This film is somewhat of a sequel to Cloverfield (2008), however some say it isn't. In a way, it is, and the connection bears the only downside to the film, but I'll get into that later. Right now, I'll discuss the positives. The best thing about 10 Cloverfield Lane is the suspense. This movie's is easily one of the most suspenseful thrillers I've ever seen, comparable to some of the greats like Se7en (1995) and Psycho (1960). Much of the suspense is due to the great acting, especially from John Goodman. While Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. did amazing, John Goodman gives one of the best performances of the 2010's. Who knew that Roseanne's husband could play one of the creepiest characters brought to film. I really hope to see him in more roles like this, because he killed it.Like mentioned earlier, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. also do fantastic, and aren't necessarily washed out by John Goodman's character. Thank you Hollywood, for finally bringing us a strong, independent female character with Michelle. Rather than some stupid person that constantly needs a guy right next to her for protection and attention, Michelle is strong and can stand alone, and face an evil man such as Howard, without a boyfriend holding her hand. John Gallagher Jr. does really well playing a confused man, wondering whether or not the end of the world is real or not, and whether or not he's being lied to. However, his character, Emmett, isn't really fleshed out all that well. This doesn't really take away from the film, since he's not the lead character. Overall, the movie's about Michelle.The directing is also amazing. 10 Cloverfield Lane is Dan Trachtenberg's first feature film, and he does amazing. I very much look forward to his future films, especially any thrillers he directs, due to just how suspenseful this movie is. All but 10 minutes of the movie takes place in a tiny bomb shelter, and yet the direction seems to open up the bunker, and make it seem bigger than it actually is. This technique is very impressive, and adds a lot to the film, rather than the location get boring after an hour or so. This actually leads me into the next point, which is the run time. This film clocks in at about 2 hours, and it flies by. The run time feels nothing like 2 hours, and a bit more like 45 minutes or so. I honestly felt like I was watching an amazing episode of some horror television show, and it happened to be astounding.Now, it may sound like I'm just praising this movie, but there was a big negative, involving only the last 10 minutes or so of the run time. Describing this with no spoilers is going to be a bit hard, but I won't ruin the movie for anyone who hasn't yet seen it. Now, the whole film, the audience, as well as Michelle and Emmett, are wondering whether or not there was an apocalypse or if Howard is just a creepy kidnapper. We find out at the end, and the outcome isn't bad in itself, but it makes another aspect of the film make no sense. Like I said, hard to explain without spoilers, so I'll just leave it at that, and you'll see what I mean when I watch it.Overall, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a very good movie, and a near perfect thriller, with great acting, including John Goodman's Oscar-worthy performance, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead's great female lead. I'm going to give 10 Cloverfield Lane an A, or a 9 out of a 10.",9,4,7,12 March 2016
Raiders of the Lost Ark," One of the Best Films Ever Made, Inspired the Action Genre
","Raiders of the Lost Ark is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, a brave adventurer who just so happens to be in a race against the Nazis to uncover the Ark of the Covenant, an item that comes straight from the Bible. Indy must gather friends in order to beat enemies, and overcome his foes against all odds, to prevent them from parading the Ark around as a weapon.Raiders is one of Spielberg's first big films, behind Jaws (1975), and he nailed it. This film is loved by children and adults alike, and will never be forgotten. He brought terror like never seen before to the big screen with Jaws, and with Raiders he created, as well as popularized, a new genre of film: action. This movie has inspired many action films, such as Die Hard (1988), The Matrix (1999), or even T2: Judgement Day (1991). Thanks to this movie, we get to see action movies regularly, whether they're good or bad.The best thing about this movie is of course one of the most iconic film characters of all time, Indiana Jones. It's crazy that this movie came out 35 years ago, and one can still pick up an Indiana Jones figure at your nearby Walmart. Harrison Ford does amazing as Indy, showing that audience that he can play more that just one awesome character. Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood is also a good casting choice, and Marion is still my favorite Indy love interest today.The direction Spielberg handled this movie in is amazing. All of the action is filmed so nicely, with not too many cuts, and clean transition when there are some. The best part of this film, the truck scene, is filmed absolutely perfectly, with no disturbances whatsoever, thanks to the fantastic camera work. This nicely shot action is also due to Harrison Ford doing his own stunts. Unlike most actor working today, save for Tom Cruise, Ford did all of his own stunts, assuring that Spielberg could get close ups of his face during the action scenes. These two elements combined make for some white knuckled action, very abundant throughout Raiders of the Lost Ark.The last thing I'll say about Raiders is the villain. There's an old saying that goes, 'a movie's only as good as its villain.' Although the viewer doesn't receive much backstory about the villain, he's still very intimidating, thanks to his army of Germans doing his dirty work for him. Paul Freeman's Belloq is a great character, that supposedly goes a long way back with Indy, however this is all we really know about him. Even though the audience doesn't know much about his background, he's still fleshed out as a character, and his tension with Indy is phenomenal.Overall, Raiders of the Lost Ark is easily one of the best films ever made, thanks to its acting, villain, and incredible action. I'm going to give Raiders of the Lost Ark an A+, or a 10 out of 10.",10,1,2,10 March 2016
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Another Spielberg Masterpiece; A Gift to Children and Adults
","E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is directed by Steven Spielberg and is the story of an alien accidentally abandoned on Earth by his parents. He soon meets a little boy named Elliott, played by Henry Thomas, and the two strike up a quick friendship. Elliott's older brother Michael (Robert Macnaughton) and younger sister Gertie (Drew Barrymore) also meet the little alien, and befriend him. However, they soon realize they aren't the only ones who know about E.T., which pits the three children against none other than the U.S. government.This film is know as a masterpiece, and it's not quite hard to see why. Spielberg has made many cherished films throughout his lifetime, including Jaws (1975), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), and Saving Private Ryan (1998). However, E.T. is his only film directed mostly towards children, and boy he nailed it. This movie isn't just about a little dumb alien that gets himself into small altercations, this movie's about childhood, and what it means to have a true friend, whether he be a person or an alien. E.T. is also about family hardships, including tough relationships with siblings, or even divorce. E.T. can be loved by kids, or by adults, and that's not a quality easily achievable.This film has many things to offer, and quite possibly the best one is, as mentioned above, the underlying themes. All of the kids in this film are dealing with their parents splitting up, and their dad lying about where he currently is to all of them. This can be related to be lots of people, mostly because of the diversity of ages between the children. Michael is about 16, Elliott's around 10, and Gertie's roughly 4. This variety of ages allows almost anybody to relate to the parental divorce factor given throughout E.T.Another theme this movie offers is the tough connection between siblings, most abundant between Michael and Elliott. Towards the beginning of the film, Michael and all of his friends poke fun at Elliott claiming he saw an alien in the back yard. Although they see it as a harmless joke, Elliott takes offense to it, even calling one of Michael's friends a slightly crude, yet hilarious, name. Later, after Michael has been confirmed the existence of the alien, his friends make fun of Elliott at a bus stop, asking which planet the 'goblin' came from. Michael quickly jumps to his brother's defense, without even thinking of what his friends may think of him afterwards. This a great example of brotherhood, that can be related to by young children, teenagers, or adults.Now, for the more technicality of the film. The direction is amazing. As always, Spielberg does a perfect job directing the movie, and getting every shot just right. The acting is great as well. Henry Thomas as Elliott is one of the best child performances of all time, thanks to the emotion he shows through caring for E.T. Drew Barrymore also does really well, especially considering she's four years old in this film. Not that she has the biggest part, or the most lines, but the scenes she is in are lightened up by her line delivery and all around adorableness. Robert Macnaughton as Michael and Dee Wallace as their mother, Mary, also deliver pretty good performances.Now, if someone went back and watched 1977's Star Wars, or even it's sequel, The Empire Strikes Back (1980), they wouldn't be able to spot a single shot that looks bad, as far as CGI goes. However, going back and watching this movie, a few of the shots, especially of the spaceship, look pretty fake. Keep in mind, this film came out in 1982, five years after Star Wars (1977) and two years after The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and some of the CGI just doesn't hold up. There are more than a few times that E.T. had some obvious green screen going on, either with the spaceship of the flying bikes (we all remember that part, right). However, this is the only negative this film has or will ever have.Overall, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is a straight up masterpiece. Many films have tried to copy this movie, including Earth to Echo (2014), and even some elements of the film Super 8 (2011), but none have ever succeeded. Thanks to it's amazing acting, fantastic themes, and great direction, E.T. gets an A, or a 9 out of 10.",9,2,2,9 March 2016
Fury," A Fantastic War Film Comparable to Saving Private Ryan and Platoon
","Fury is directed by David Ayer and stars Brad Pitt as Don 'Wardaddy' Collier, the leader of an American World War II tank squad. During this time, German tanks were very superior that of the American models, so being in a tank squad was a hard job to commit to. However, once Logan Lerman's character, a drafted clerk named Norman, is assigned to Wardaddy's tank squad, he learns the true nature of war, and just some of the horrible things humans can do to one another. I would, in a heartbeat, call Fury one of the best war films ever made. Fury almost perfectly follows in the footsteps of other legendary war films such as Saving Private Ryan (1998) and Platoon (1986), which are both recognized as amazing feats in filmmaking. Fury is very close to perfect, and does almost everything right. Besides one very small issue, I loved every single minute of Fury, and felt that it's a fantastic movie.The absolute best thing about Fury is the comradery between the men in the tank squad. The close friendship between Wardaddy (Pitt), Bible (Shia LaBeouf), Gordo (Michael Pena), Coon-A*s (Jon Bernthal), and, eventually, Norman (Lerman) is incredible. Due to the comradery expressed between the men, the audience begins to feel for each and every character, and have large amounts of both sorrow and pity on their behalfs. All of the actors do great as well. Fury is Logan Lerman's best work to date, being slightly better than that of his performance in The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012), and way better than the Percy Jackson series. Brad Pitt also does amazing, as usual, along with Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal. Although I don't like him as an actor, I do have to say that Shia LaBeouf did really good in his role. His character was near flawlessly well rounded, and I felt for him and his situation.The direction, by David Ayer, is amazing. Each and every shot of just how grotesque and awful war really is was shown magnificently, and brought a harsh realness to Fury. Also, however small the tank may be, the direction impressively seemed to enlarge it, as if there was actually room for five grown men to live regularly. The tank, called 'Fury,' is given the feel of a home, and begins to feel comforting to both the characters and the audience. However, it also feels claustrophobic, which was a great movie on Ayer's part. While giving the tank room to open up, it also felt very closed, which was a great aspect of Fury.My only real problem with Fury was a small portion in the middle of the second act in which roughly twenty minutes of the runtime takes place in one small apartment. Although we learn insightful things about our characters, and the scene does feel necessary, it tends to drag on incredibly, near boring the viewer, and makes the film seem a lot longer than it actually is. This sequence was good, no doubt about it, but it was too long, and dragged on to the point of slight exasperation.The last point I'll make about Fury is the gruesome aspect of it. Although some people can't handle over the top violence, Fury goes for the R rating with open arms. The war violence is over the top, almost to the point of insanity, but it gives a realistic feel to the film, as well as adding some gut wrenching scenes of death and destruction. Not everyone likes violence in movies, and that's understandable, but, for a war film like Fury, it works in every way possible. The extreme violence is acceptable for Fury, because of the point it tries to express: war is bad. War is disgusting, grotesque, and not a pretty thing. However, as humans, we have to accept that as a fact of life. This message is wonderfully displayed through the utmost violence and death.Overall, Fury really is a great movie. Almost everything about it works in a positive way, and there's much enjoyment, and a good message, to be had in it. I'd recommend Fury to anyone who can handle a large amount of war violence.",9,4,7,13 May 2016
Fight Club," One of the Best Films Of All Time With a Perfect Script
","Fight Club is directed by David Fincher and stars Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf, and Jared Leto. Edward Norton's character, known only as the Narrator, is living a depressing life. His day job is behind a desk, and he accompanies himself by buying things that he doesn't really need in order to find fulfillment in his life. He begins attending support groups for conditions that he doesn't have, in order to feel relief through expressing his pain to those who have it worse.Once Bonham Carter's character, Marla Singer, begins showing up to these meetings, he begins to feel remorse in his life again. However, once he meets cool guy Tyler Durden (Pitt), he, along with Tyler, start a 'fight club,' a place in which men who seek fulfillment may find it through beating each other up. Once things with both Tyler and Marla begin to get a bit shaky, our Narrator must fix his own problems without the help of others.It's very rare to find a film in which you completely love everything about. In my humble opinion, however, Fight Club is easily one of the best films ever made. With its eerie direction, fantastic acting, and more than compelling characters, Fight Club is as close as it gets to perfect, with no issues to be found in it. The flawless script contributes to my liking of this movie, due to amazing dialogue and great detail upon the current setting.If anyone has ever read the script for Fight Club, it's just shy of 200 pages, and that is magnificently impressive. The detail the script goes into is purely astounding, and the lines are written, and performed, perfectly. The script, written by Jim Uhls (and based off of the novel by Chuck Palahniuk), is incredibly written in near every way, with great in depth depictions of how each shot was to be set up, and how the actors were to perform their lines.The direction, by David Fincher, is exemplary, with great camera angles and surprisingly memorable shots. The shot I remember most particularly is when Tyler Durden is delivering the final rule of fight club (that being the eighth), and the camera zooms on the side of his face, passing his head and spinning quickly to the next shot of two men fighting. Every single shot, like the one just mentioned, is brilliant, excellently pulled off by Fincher.The characters, combined with the talented acting behind them, is also very unique. Although the Narrator is supposed to be a boring everyday man, the viewer cares for his situations deeply. Throughout the film, he breaks the fourth wall multiple times, and this adds a very personal level the caring for him through the entire run time of the film. Norton plays this character wonderfully, thanks to his great acting abilities. The character of Tyler Durden is easily one of the best, and coolest, characters ever put to film. Every line that Pitt delivers as Tyler is flawless, and deserves all the recognition that a character, and his actor, could ever receive.The other characters, such as Bonham Carter's Marla, Meat Loaf's Bob, and Jared Leto's Angel Face, are also amazing. The audience quickly sympathizes with everybody in the film, thanks to great acting and dialogue. Once again, the script's lines are written and delivered flawlessly, with each actor giving his or her line ideally. Each character is well rounded, and has a great arc throughout the run time of Fight Club.The pacing of Fight Club is also astounding. An almost 2 hour 30 minute film goes by as if the story is told in 20 minutes, and flies by so quickly. This is mostly due to the quick, yet detailed, script, and fantastic direction. Both Fincher and Uhls make this movie zoom by, as if no time has gone by at all. Each of the actors also contribute to this aspect, ultimately making the film feel very short.The last thing I'll mention is the plot twist. Without spoiling anything, Fight Club has one of, if not the, best plot twists in film history. Everything throughout the film sets up for the twist, yet we, the audience, don't pick up on the clues when watching the film for the first time. Fight Club is a rare type of film in which contains a better experience watching it for the second time than watching it for the first. The twist is perfectly built up to, and flawlessly executed in every way.Overall, Fight Club is one of my favorite films of all time, and I like to say that it's one of the best movies ever made. I'd recommend Fight Club to anyone that can handle violence and language, because it's truly worth anyone's time.",10,6,12,10 May 2016
Inglourious Basterds," A Fantastic World War II Film With Two Excellent Leads
","Inglourious Basterds is written and directed by Quentin Tarantino and stars Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz, Diane Kruger, Michael Fassbender, Eli Roth, Daniel Brühl, and Mélanie Laurent. It tells many stories throughout its World War II French setting, all of them leading into one, spectacular climax. Brad Pitt plays Lieutenant Aldo Raine, an American soldier with a furious hatred of Nazis, who leads a group of men looking for a Nazi officer named Hans Landa, played by Christoph Waltz. This quest leads these characters, as well as much more, on an epic quest for redemption and blood lust.Two years after his 2007 film, Death Proof, Quentin Tarantino released to the public Inglourious Basterds, a film in which he subliminally claims to be his masterpiece. Is it his best film? That's a matter of opinion, but whether or not it is a great film isn't a matter of question. Inglourious Basterds is the best World War II film since Saving Private Ryan (1998), without a doubt. The excellent script, compelling characters, and amazing direction create a fantastic film, one could call a masterpiece.The astounding characters are really what push this film to the next level. The two leads, Brad Pitt's Aldo Raine and Christoph Waltz's Hans Landa, set up Inglourious Basterds as a cat and mouse story of sorts. Lt. Aldo Raine chases after Col. Hans Landa, and vice versa. When the film eventually comes to a confrontation between the two, the dialogue is nothing short of genius. Both Pitt and Waltz do superb in their roles, bringing to life two stereotypical, yet seemingly fresh, characters that are more than compelling.Every other actor in Inglourious Basterds holds their own as well, and aren't outshadowed by the two leads. Michael Fassbender portrays an American soldier under the command of Lt. Aldo Raine, and does so very well. His character is very refreshing, and seems grounded compared to the other, more 'over-the-top' characters. Diane Kruger plays a famous actress named Bridget von Hammersmark, who is loved by both the Americans and the Germans. Her character is very likable, and grows on the audience very quickly. All other actors, such as Mélanie Laurent and Daniel Brühl, do great as well, just don't hold down as large of roles as the ones mentioned.The script in this movie in brilliant. Specifically during the interrogation scenes, the suspense that is built up through flawless dialogue is simply incredible. Each character says exactly what their character needs to say exactly when they need to say it. The actors also aid the tension through their incredible acting abilities. In fact, the most interesting scenes in this film are the ones in which the characters just sit down and talk. Just through the dialogue, Quentin Tarantino, who also wrote the script, can get an entire audience on the edge of their seats, and that's a rare thing for a writer to be able to do.The direction, by Tarantino, is, as always, great. There's one specific shot in which the camera follows a character as she walks through a few different rooms, all while the camera is tracking from a ceiling view. This shot goes on for more than a few seconds, and my jaw dropped while watching it. This specific shot, and many more like it, add so much to the already magnificent film that Inglourious Basterds is.Overall, Inglourious Basterds is a fantastic film. I wouldn't necessarily label it as a 'masterpiece,' but it still is a great movie. I'd recommend it to anyone who can handle the violence (which isn't too much, should I add), and some bad language.",10,1,4,26 June 2016
Iron Man 2," The MCU's Worst Film To Date, Thanks to Bill O'Reilly
","Jon Favreau returns to direct Iron Man 2, once again starring Robert Downey Jr., this time as the open superhero Iron Man; open meaning he has no secret identity. When things begin to stop going his way, he becomes very irrational, drinking at parties and ruining his reputation. When an enemy comes around, a Russian named Ivan Vanko, Tony must put aside his immature actions, and once again assume the role of the one and only Iron Man.To begin, I don't know what happened to Jon Favreau's mind in between Iron Man (2008) and this movie. Some movie-hating parasite must've crawled inside of Favreau's ear and influenced him to make a bad movie. This movie isn't, in my opinion at least, absolutely horrible, but no normal human could say this film is good. The cheap plot, bad dialogue, horrible villainization, and the fact that the whole film is a trailer for The Avengers (2012).To start with the pros, Robert Downey Jr. does pretty good as Tony Stark, and Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts is pretty good as well. Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko isn't really an overwhelming performance, and neither was Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer. The best casting choice, however, was Bill O'Reilly as himself. Yes, Bill O'Reilly is in this movie. And he's the highlight. Just kidding.The special effects aren't the best, and it shows most during the fight scenes. The CG on Whiplash (Ivan Vanko) is really bad, especially during the final fight scene, in which the main villain fights for about two and a half minutes. There is honestly more arguing in this film more than any actual physical fighting.The plot is also very bad. Many plot holes exist throughout this movie. I feel as if Marvel sacrificed this movie so that The Avengers (2012) could be good, which paid off. However, I also feel that Marvel could have made both of the films good, without have making Iron Man 2 bad like it is. There's many ways this movie could have been better, starting with the introduction of our villains. There's an old saying that says 'a movie is only as good as its villain.' This is true most of the time, including this film as an example. Whiplash, or Ivan Vanko, is a villain that is only introduced by the history between his father (Anton Vanko) and Howard Stark, Tony's father.Overall, Iron Man 2 is a very washed down film, with a poor villain and some bad acting. The plot was cheap, and the exposition was way too heavy. I'm going to give Iron Man 2 a C-, or a 7 out of 10.",6,1,2,6 March 2016
Alien: Resurrection," An Awful Film With Near Nothing Going For It
","Alien Resurrection is directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and once again stars Sigourney Weaver, this time as a clone of Ellen Ripley. 200 years after the events of Alien 3 (1992), Ripley is resurrected, hence the title, so that scientists can extract the alien queen that was inside of her. However, this Ripley is a hybrid of Ripley and an alien queen, so she has a few extra perks, such as super strength and acid blood. When an alien breaks loose on the ship she's on, she must team up with space pirates to ultimately stop it from killing everyone on board.Simply put, this film was trash. I found nothing good about Alien: Resurrection; even Sigourney Weaver's acting was pretty bad.. Not a single thing in Alien: Resurrection was good, and I could barely force myself to keep watching it. The direction, the script, the characters, the acting, and even the special effects were bad. Everything about Alien: Resurrection was completely awful.The worst thing about Alien: Resurrection was the characters and the actors that portrayed them. Sigourney Weaver doesn't do bad, but she's far from good. All of the other actors are pretty bad, and were disappointing in every single way, especially that of Winona Ryder. Both her acting and character, Call, was horrible. Her character was annoying and got in the way of any productivity, and Ryder didn't even play the part well. All of her lines were delivered as if a 9 year old child was delivering them.The script and direction are both incredibly lazy. Not a single shot in the entire film stands out, and the lines written are either boring or bad. The few lines that aren't complete garbage are bland, and feel like a premature script writer with no experience had written them. The saddest thing is, Joss Whedon wrote the script. His abilities have obviously matured since that of Alien: Resurrection, but that doesn't excuse the bad writing. All of the direction was pretty boring and grim, and didn't provide the film with a decent atmosphere.The special effects, while not as bad as in Alien 3 (1992), still aren't that good. Most of the shots of an alien swimming, or climbing a ladder, or running on walls looked really fake and inexcusable. Most of the 'suspenseful' moments with the protagonists running from the aliens were completely tensionless, mostly due to the audience not even caring about the characters. Even Ripley's character has no feel to her, because she's not even Ripley; she's a clone of the actual Ellen Ripley, who was killed 200 years prior to this film's setting. All dynamics were stripped from the characters by the poor script, and left the characters as nothing more than names and bad acting.The worst part of Alien: Resurrection is the main antagonist towards the end of the film. I don't want to go into details and end up spoiling it, but the alien that Ripley is forced to fight at the end of the film is just awful. Nothing about this villain was compelling, or even scary. Not only was the character in itself bad, it also looked terribly unpleasant. Although the aliens are regularly grotesque, this particular antagonist was just horrible in every single way.In conclusion, Alien: Resurrection never should've been made. Not only is the script lacking, the characters are appalling, and aren't portrayed well. Alien: Resurrection is a step down from all three of its prior films in every single way, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",1,7,11,9 May 2016
Zootopia," Easily an Animated Classic; Best Disney Film Since The Lion King (1994)
","Zootopia is directed by Byron Howard, Rich Moore, and Jared Bush, and stars Ginnifer Goodwin as Judy Hopps, a bunny rabbit that lives in a world in which animals are civilized, and live in cities together. She dreams of being a police officer in a big city called Zootopia, even though all of her peers, including her parents, try to keep her under the 'status quo,' in which she is just a simple carrot farmer. She disagrees with this, and becomes a police officer, yet realizes that she was handed a case bigger than she could imagine; a case she must solve with the help of a sly fox named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman).To begin, Zootopia is hands down the best Disney film since The Lion King (1994). Everything about this movie was utterly amazing, and surprised me in so many ways. The underlying tone and themes, the characters, the plot, the voice acting, and the animation. First, the primary themes in the film are actually very dark and deep. There's symbolism of racism, sexism, drugs, and even what American is supposed to stand for, yet fails at doing. All of these themes play across perfectly, and are very surprising in a children's movie.The characters and plot in this film are both equally perfect. The plot shows that anybody can be anything, and the characters describe this so very well. All of the characters are very interesting, and three-dimensional in ways that are subtle, yet obvious once the film all come together. Each character has a great arc throughout the movie, and learns a lesson through experiences and other characters they meet.The voice acting is this film is rare. I mean this by saying the the voice acting is absolutely perfect. There isn't a single flaw with the acting, and each actor portrays their character amazingly. Jason Bateman as Nick Wilde was a perfect casting choice, although it didn't seem that way prior to viewing the film. Ginnifer Goodwin as Judy Hopps was also amazing, and brought the character to life in such a way that is near impossible for an animated movie. Idris Elba as Police Chief Bobo is also fantastic. He depicts a hardened police officer is a way I never would have thought of. Even Shakira does really good in this movie, which is something I never thought I would say.The animation in Zootopia is also top notch. Every tiny, seemingly insignificant movement, by any and every character, flows flawlessly with the background, and looks absolutely perfect. All of the animation is ultimately impeccable.Overall, Zootopia is an amazing film that children will love seeing, along with their parents or older siblings. It will easily be known as a Disney classic in 20 years or so, due to the animation, characters, acting, and intense plot. Zootopia deserves an A+, or a 10 out of 10.",10,8,21,5 March 2016
Spider-Man 2," Perfect Mix Between Action, Superhero, and Drama
","Spiderman 2 is directed by Sam Raimi and once again stars Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, a nerdy kid attending college in New York. However, he's secretly a superhero as well, a hero that calls himself 'Spiderman.' After the accidental death of his last villain, the Green Goblin, the tension between Peter and his best friend, Harry, has heightened, and the connection between Peter and his love interest, Mary Jane has begun to feel uneasy. Once a new villain called Doctor Octopus has presented himself, Peter must balance his life as a superhero and a college kid while keeping his relationships intact.Spiderman 2 is one of those rare sequels that improves upon the already amazing first film. Most everything in Spiderman 2 is great in most ways, and stands as one of the best superhero films to date. With a great villain, script, and perfectly well-rounded main character, Spiderman 2 is everything it promised to be. Sam Raimi handles this movie pleasantly, and not only built upon the first installment in the franchise, but improved upon it as well.The confliction of the main character, Peter, is absolutely flawless. Constantly throughout the film, the script beats Peter, and the audience, over the head with his problems. His failing relationship with Mary Jane, his inability to hold a job or keep grades up, the constant feel of tension between Peter and Harry, and the new villain on the rise, Doctor Octopus, all combine to make Peter's life completely awful. As the audience, we feel these conflicts through our main character, and subsequently want him to come out on top even more than before seeing the film. This capability to emotionally feel what the main character is what makes any protagonist, whether it be Spiderman or Han Solo, great.The acting, as well, is fantastic. Tobey Maguire, while not exactly improving upon his performance in Spiderman (2002), again does pretty well. Maguire plays a great Peter, and a decent Spidey, which add together for an ultimate success. James Franco plays an even better Harry this time around, improving upon his original performance in every way. Once again, Kirsten Dunst plays a pretty good Mary Jane. While her performance is fine, the character of Mary Jane starts to feel almost like an antagonist throughout the movie. Through her shaky connection with Peter, the audience is, at first, confused with her actions, and then just starts to get slightly annoyed with her character.Despite all of the great performances throughout Spiderman 2, Alfred Molina completely steals the show, playing a magnificent Doctor Octopus. Although Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin/Norman Osborn was great, Molina's performance slightly tops that of Dafoe's. Molina plays an astounding villain, with an understandable motivation and a sensible plan. Doc Ock isn't just a bad guy for sake of being a bad guy; he makes sense. The viewer understands why he does the things he does, and won't take him for granted at all. From his actions to his lines, Alfred Molina's Doc Ock is one of the best superhero villains in cinematic history.Sam Raimi also handles the direction very well. Throughout the entire film, no action is filmed poorly, with no quick or abundant cuts, and great wide shots of Spidey swinging around the city. However, Raimi knows when to cut down on the 'cool' shots and such during a talking or exposition scene. He smartly recognizes when the camera shouldn't be taking over for the script, and it pays off greatly. Although he utilizes his traditional 'Raimi' camera angles, it works out well, and doesn't distract at all from the plot and characters.Now, I can't write a review of Spiderman 2 without mentioning the train sequence. The train sequence involves Spidey and Doc Ock fighting on a moving train, and it's easily one of the best action sequences in superhero film history. Everything about this sequence is absolutely perfect, and it works in every way. This particular sequence combines the genres of comic book and action so flawlessly, and it works perfectly.The only issue I took up with Spiderman 2 was a small one, but it is present. It is very hard to explain without spoilers, but it is this: Peter's problems are large throughout this film, and it's obvious. However, one of his specific problems is only halfway present. The problem is existent, but it disappears when convenient. Like mentioned above, hard to say without spoilers, but there it is.Spiderman 2 is one of the greatest superhero films ever created, and slightly improves upon its predecessor. I'd recommend Spiderman 2 to anyone who enjoys action and drama wrapped together in one movie.",9,5,9,4 May 2016
Batman Returns," Too Much Undeserving Hate, It's Not That Bad
","Batman Returns is directed by Tim Burton and stars Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne, a millionaire living in Gotham City that secretly spends his nights fighting crime as a vigilante called Batman. After the defeat of his greatest villain, the Joker (Jack Nicholson), Batman has done a relatively good job at keeping the streets clean. However, a new villain is on the rise, a deformed man named Oswald Cobblepot (Danny DeVito), that calls himself the Penguin. Batman must find a way to defeat the new evil, all while managing his very complicated relationship with the infamous Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer).While a good amount of people dislike this movie, I actually really enjoy it. I think there are many good elements to Returns, and it may even be as good as the original Batman (1989). Although many criticize Tim Burton's takeover of this film, I don't mind it all that much. This film may not be perfect, but it definitely accomplishes at least one thing: it's fun.The best thing about this movie has got to be the acting. Michael Keaton's Batman, although not my favorite, is legendary. Keaton definitely does a great job as both Bruce Wayne and the caped crusader, and started an amazing legacy. Danny DeVito also plays a near perfect Penguin, and captures a great image of how disturbing and grotesque Oswald really is. Michelle Pfeiffer, although not my favorite Catwoman, does a great job as Selina Kyle, especially in the sequence in which she transitions from normal Selina into Catwoman. Another great casting choice that's overlooked a lot is Christopher Walken as Max Shreck. Walken plays this dirty business man amazingly, and really shows how cruel a person can be.The direction in Batman Returns, I feel, is really good as well. Many people say that Tim Burton went too much Tim Burton on this film, and made it less of a Batman movie, and more of a Burton movie, which I subtly agree with. Although I still think it has more of a Batman feel that a Burton feel, I do see where those accusations come in play. Certain factors of Returns overly captures the oddness of Burton, and, while that can be good, it goes a bit overboard.My complaints with this movie really lie with small things, and aren't anything big, for instance the sexual element of the film, mostly revolving around Catwoman. Catwoman is a sexy, sleek character in both the comics and films, and that's a good thing, because it adds to the complications between her and Bruce. However, she's just a complete slut in Batman Returns. Not only does she friggin' lick Keaton's face, she has some very sexual dialogue, specifically in 'the scene' with the Penguin (you know the one). There are many infamous lines throughout the movie, and about 80% of them come from banter between Selina and Oswald. I'm not going to provide examples, because I don't know who's going to be reading this, but just go under the 'quotes' section on IMDb: there's some weird lines in this movie.Another small complaint I found in the film is the vividness of Gotham. Although Tim Burton made his two Batman films dark, Gotham itself doesn't seem too depressing. This is mostly thanks the giant bronze statues positioned throughout the city, and the giant lit up Christmas tree. As far as the statues, they stuck around for Joel Schumacher's Batman films, and we all know how those ended up. Burton makes the city dark, yes, but there are certain parts of the film that just take away from the grittiness that the filmmakers tried to inspire.The last point I'll hit is another positive, and that's the costumes and makeup, specifically on Danny DeVito. The disgusting, round body piece that DeVito had to wear (watch the special features), and the amazing prosthetics on his face, mostly the crooked, pointy nose, are fantastic. The extremities that were involved in making the Penguin look just how disturbing he does is unfathomable to think about. Danny DeVito, who spent five hours in makeup each day, really dedicated himself to this role, and earned any money that Batman Returns provided him with.In conclusion, Batman Returns gets a lot of undeserving hate, and really is a good film, both in Batman terms and in just general terms. Anybody should see this movie, especially if you're a fan of either Batman or Tim Burton.",8,3,9,3 April 2016
Creed," The Best Film in the Rocky Franchise Since Rocky (1976)
","Creed is directed by Ryan Coogler and stars Michael B. Jordan as Adonis Creed, the son of the famous Apollo Creed. Adonis loves to fight, but feels that he's not good enough to take on the professionals. Upon coming to this conclusion, he quits his office job and moves to Philadelphia, seeking out the help of the former boxing champion, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), who has retired and now lives a peaceful life owning a small diner called 'Adrian's.'To start, I personally think this is the best film in the Rocky franchise since the first Rocky (1976). Yes, 2 ,3, and even 4 were pretty good, but this film just packs a punch that brings Rocky Balboa and his life to this generation, basically doing what Rocky Balboa (2006) tried, but failed. Michael B. Jordan owns the role of Adonis Creed, and shows that his role in Fantastic Four (2015) was just a one time flunk. This movie was great.Sly Stallone playing Rocky needs no words. Stallone doesn't play Rocky Balboa, he IS Rocky Balboa. He has appeared in other films, but he'll always be Rocky to me and most others. Tessa Thompson as Bianca, Adonis' love interest, is great. I hope to see her in any possible sequels, or any other film in general.The choreography during the boxing scenes is also very noteworthy. Just like the first Rocky, it felt as if I were at the fight as it was going down. This also is due to the directing of the action. The directing is very clean, and there's not too many cuts. Many wide shots were used to encapsulate the entire ring, rather than just getting Adonis, or just his opponent. The audience feels involved in the fight, as if you're a fly in the boxing stadium.The only problem I found in this film is a very small one, but it prevents this film from being perfect. The issue was the final fight, between Adonis and Ricky Conlan (Tony Bellew), the reigning champion. This fight, while well choreographed and acted, wasn't as intense as another fight that had taken place earlier in the film. The fight wasn't bad; far from it. However, it didn't enthrall me like I wanted it to.Overall, Creed was an amazing film. I recommend it to anyone who likes the feeling of not being able to stop smiling after watching a movie. I'm going to give Creed an A, or a 9 out of 10.",9,2,5,3 March 2016
The Mummy," Cheesy Indiana Jones Rip Off, Yet Good
","The Mummy was directed by Stephen Sommers and stars Brendan Fraser as an adventurous hero who can carry a lot of guns. The Mummy, just like every other movie in existence, has its good qualities and its bad qualities. Its good qualities include a good plot, and good special effects. Its bad qualities include a bad plot, and bad special effects.What I mean by the above paragraph is that half of the plot, and half of the special effects, are good. The other half suck. To get started, I'll give a brief synopsis: We start out in ancient Egypt and the Pharoah at the time was a jealous guy. He literally didn't let anybody touch his wife. However, his high priest, a man named Imhotep, and his wife were in the middle of a passionate affair, and are busted by the Pharaoh. The Pharaoh sees the body paint on his wife's arm is smeared, implying that another person has touched her. He is then surprised to see it is Imhotep. He is then murdered by Imhotep and his wife, who then proceeds to kill herself, simply because we need a plot.Imhotep then runs away, but returns to try to resurrect his long lost love. However, in the middle of the ceremony, he is interrupted by the Pharaoh's guards, and sentenced to the worst torture possible, in which the victim's tongue is cut off, and is mummified alive and put into a sarcophagus with flesh-eating bugs, so that he will suffer for a long period of time. Then, it skips forward to 1923 and our hero, Rick O'Connell, is in the middle of a war for the land in which Imhotep is buried. He is abandoned by his friend, Beni, and is almost killed. He escapes, but is later found in prison 3 years later. A woman, named Evy Camahan, and her brother, Jonathan, bail Rick out, and go on an adventure to uncover treasure near Imhotep's burial site. They later find and open his sarcophagus and release him on accident. They now must find a way to stop his plan to resurrect his lover and defeat him in order so save the world.The Mummy is very reliant on its special effects. This film was released in 1999, a time when they did not have as good of effects as nowadays. However, most of the CGI in the movie was not only believable, but rather good. For instance, all of the scenes containing Imhotep, prior to his state of full-regeneration, look very real, with pieces of his flesh missing about his body. Also, in scenes where a flesh-eating bug is crawling inside of someone's skin, it looks very real. Despite all of the good effects in this film, some of them are either non-believable, or just plain bad. An example of this would be far-off shots of cities look like a cheap model bought at the local Dollar General of a set from Raiders of the Lost Ark.Another issue would be the plot. Some of the plot makes perfect sense, and really advances the movie, but other pieces feel like they're just there so that there can be a plot. For example, in the middle of the movie, the team figures out that Imhotep wants Evy so that he can use her as his human sacrifice in order to resurrect his ancient girlfriend. Now, why would he choose her? To me, it felt like he chose her just to give Rick a chance to rescue the damsel in distress. Another good example would be how the Mummy must kill all of the men who opened the box that contained the book of death. When he tries to claim his first victim, he is interrupted, and only gets his hands on the man's tongue and eyeballs. This makes no sense; that he had to take his time in order to get the guy's full body. When he kills the other three men, the process happens instantly. But apparently, this first guy was special, because he had to take his sweet time with him.Despite the dents in the plot, there are well written parts that really help out the movie. One of these parts would be in the middle of the movie, when the treasure hunters are attacked by a group of men guarding the tomb. Rick is about to get killed by one of these men, but lights the fuse of a dynamite stick, which seems like a really stupid idea at the time. However, if any of you listen to the audio commentary, the director explains that this was put in the movie so that the group could see that Rick wasn't at the site just for treasure, he was willing to risk his life, and those around him, for the knowledge of the history contained in the city.So, through watching it twice, and once with the commentary, overall, I liked The Mummy. It had a decent plot, likable characters, and halfway good CGI. After consideration, I'd give this film a B-, or a 7 out of 10.",7,2,4,27 January 2016
Dead Poets Society," A Great Film, Making Me Want To 'Carpe Diem'
","Dead Poets Society is directed by Peter Weir and is the story of a group of boys that attend a boarding school called Welton Academy, in the 1950's. These boys' futures have all been planned out by their rich parents, and are basically bred to be nothing short of lawyers and doctors. Eventually, their English teacher leaves the school, and is replaced by a new teacher, named Mr. Keating, played by Robin Williams. Keating teaches them how to do something that they've never known before: how to live. He tells them to 'Carpe Diem,' or seize the day, so that they can live their own lives, not their parents.Dead Poets Society is considered one of Robin Williams' best movies, and I can't see why it's called this. Now, he does good in the film, yes, but it isn't his movie. Although he is casted as the main character, he's not. He's really the mentor of the film, and the main character is provided through the boys, whose variety of personalities gives every audience member someone to relate to in one way or another. I wouldn't call this movie a Robin Williams movie at all, because it's an amazing stand alone film, that just happens to feature Williams as a supporting character.Now, the above paragraph shouldn't stop anyone from thinking this is a good film, because it surely is. The movie has many underlying themes, the main one being to Carpe Diem, which is a quote I've been familiar with for a long time. I've known what this means for a while now, yet this movie still affected the way I view the common phrase. I say common because one may hear this a lot, whether it be from friends, family, or by seeing it on a cheap wooden plaque that hangs on the wall. However film provides a whole new perspective (another big theme in Dead Poets Society) to the 'common' phrase. This movie takes the saying and applies it to many things, including poetry, future goals, and just regular things that happens as a young man, told excellently through the characters.This movie has many great things to offer, including the direction, most of the acting, the script, and the amazing symbolism, as described above. However, one thing I feel that most people have somewhat swept under the rug about this film is the villainous characters in the movie. Debatably the main villain is the headmaster of Welton, Mr. Nolan, played by Norman Lloyd. Now, Mr. Nolan operates the school, and all of the staff and students within it, limitlessly, without restrictions. If he wants something to happen, it happens. If he wanted a student to be expelled, they were expelled. If he wanted a teacher fired, they were fired. That's probably how Mr. Keating became a teacher there in the first place. Now, if I attended Welton, I would be walking on eggshells all the time no matter what. However, if I had a headmaster with the likes of Mr. Nolan, I would wet my pants every time I passed him in the hallway. This guy would scare the crap of me, especially if I knew that he could just expel me anytime that he felt it was a good idea. This is a big element in the movie that I feel isn't mentioned the way it should be, and I was glad to see a great villain in a great film, since that's somewhat rare nowadays.The other positive I'll mention is the characters. The characters, mostly of the boys, were amazing characters. Although I didn't love all of the actors, I think the script paid amazing homage to the type of young men they were, and made them very relatable. In one way or another, I could relate to every single one of the boys in the movie, from quiet Todd (Ethan Hawke), to gregarious Charlie, nicknamed 'Nuwanda' (Gale Hansen). The only casting choices I didn't completely approve of was that of Josh Charles as Knox Overstreet, who, I felt, could've done better as this character. For those who haven't seen it, Knox's main issue is his utter infatuation with a beautiful girl from a public school, named Chris, played by Alexandra Powers. Being a pubescent boy 'in love' with this girl, I thought he could've done better, or have been replaced completely.Now, the one big negative I have with Dead Poets Society is the, well, the Robin-Williams-isms throughout this film. Not that Williams does bad, but he seemingly has to slip in his personal qualities into the character of Mr. Keating, such as doing funny impressions of John Wayne and Marlon Brando while citing a serious quote from Shakespeare. Now, I'm no kill joy, and I understand it was written for comic relief, but there was enough funny parts slipped into Keating's interactions with the boys, that the characteristics of Robin Williams himself didn't need to be mixed into the concoction of Mr. Keating's character. This also caught the viewer a bit off guard, when a serious scene suddenly busted into the boys laughing a joke that wasn't all that funny, which took away from the realism of the movie.In short, Dead Poets Society is an amazing film, with great acting, characters, a good script, and fantastic underlying themes that compels the audience to go out there and 'seize the day.'",9,0,0,24 March 2016
Spotlight," Worth Its Best Picture Win; The Schindler's List (1993) of Today
","Spotlight is directed by Tom McCarthy and is the true story of the Boston Globe news reporters that uncovered the scandal of Catholic priests molesting children throughout Boston, and the entire world even. If I had to label this film a genre, I would most likely call it a psychological thriller. I would name it this because of the major character arcs that take place with each and every one of the characters. All of the characters slowly become obsessed with the story, and struggle with maintaining their personal life, due to their entire lives being wrapped up with the case. This element is what makes Spotlight so great.The second best thing about Spotlight has to be the acting, starting with Mark Ruffalo. Ruffalo easily gives his best performance to date, portraying and average guy that learns about these horrible things. He doesn't take the news like a movie character, however. He accepts the story just how a normal person would, by just being down about it. He doesn't flip out and start punching people, he just reacts in such a way that gives the film such a realism factor, that the viewer feels like they're watching a documentary, rather that a feature length film.Michael Keaton also gives one of the best performances of his career. It's so nice to see him in another good role, showing that Birdman (2014) wasn't just a one time fluke. Keaton plays a higher up official in the Boston Globe, and seems to be stalling on when the story should be released, and butts heads with Ruffalo's character due to their disagreement on this subject. Rachel McAdams also does great, especially in scenes in which she is interviewing specific victims of the priest molestation. She almost seems like a nurse or a mother figure, letting these people know that it's okay that this happened, and that they aren't responsible.Tom McCarthy also does a great job behind that camera. I believe it's safe to say that this film is near perfectly directed, say for a few wide shots of characters running through the streets of Boston; these can look a bit sketchy at times. However, all other directing looks amazing, and very clean. There's a particular shot in the movie that is of a character walking through a neighborhood, looking for a certain house. One on going shot lasts about 30 seconds, and captures the entire walk he goes for, and this is just one example.The last great thing I'll mention is the message this film puts across: this can't happen again. Much like a little 1993 film called Schindler's List, the entire theme of this film is the prevention of the circumstances shown throughout the movie. We simply can't allow these events to ever take place again, whether you be talking about the molestation, or the cover up of it.The only problem I had with the film was a very small, nitpicky issue. The sour length of the second act. As the first act leads into the second, it does so smoothly, and feels like a clean transition. However, towards the end of the second act, the film begins to go a bit slower, and feels overlong. Once the third act kicks into play, this factor completely disappears, but was still present during the second act, making the film feel a bit longer than it is.Overall, Spotlight is an amazing film, worthy of it's best picture win, thanks to it's great directs, hard-hitting theme, and the absolutely terrific acing. I'm going to give Spotlight an A, or a 9 out of 10.",9,0,0,8 March 2016
X-Men," A Landmark in the Superhero Genre
","X-Men is directed by Bryan Singer and is the origin story of the X- Men, a team of mutants that turn superheroes in order to stop a mutant named Magneto that is preparing, and attempting to start, a full on war between mutants and humans. When Magneto, and a few other mutants, threaten civil society as we know it, the X-Men must put aside their differences and fight to stop an all out war between the two classes of people, mutant, and human.X-Men is the first successful Marvel film, and it's easy to see why. Although Marvel films have been better, X-Men, in a way, paved the way for every other Marvel movie to come, from Spiderman (2002) to Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). With likable characters, great direction, and fantastic special effects, X-Men is a very enjoyable film in whole, and works in every genre of film it was going for, be it action, superhero, and even a sci-fi.X-Men offers some amazingly relatable characters that the audience immediately feels for in each and every situation. Although this was my favorite feature of the film, I feel this is where its biggest weakness lies as well. Although characters like Wolverine, Professor X, Rogue, and Magneto are very well-rounded, most of the others aren't. We get to know a little bit about Jean Grey, Cyclops, and Storm, but not too much all in all. We know that Jean Grey hopes to be much like Professor X when older, but that's about it. We also know that there is conflict between Cyclops and Wolverine due to their mutual affection for Jean Grey, but nothing else about their characters.The characters of Mystique, Sabretooth, and Toad, who are the mutants working with Magneto, aren't given much depth to either. Although it's cool to see Mystique transform into other people, but we aren't given much, if any, information about her character on a personal level. Sabretooth and Toad are both characters that have special powers, but no personalities. They both feel as if they are basically the 'grunts' of Magneto's team, and don't really serve that large of a purpose in the movie.The direction, by Bryan Singer, is actually quite amazing. Every action scene, as well as exposition scene, is so nicely filmed in every way. All of the action looks very nice, with no quick cuts or shaky cam to be found. Bryan Singer did an excellent job with the camera, and made X-Men look very good. The special effects are probably the best thing I could say about X-Men. The CGI throughout the entire movie is revolutionary, from Mystique shapeshifting to Wolverine's metal claws coming straight out of his knuckles. There's not a single shot in which the audience might call out 'fake,' due to the amazingly impressive special effects littered all throughout X-Men.The acting is also very impressive. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, as we all know, is a perfect casting choice, and he does fantastic in his role. Both Ian McKellan and Sir Patrick Stewart as Magneto and Professor X play two age old rivals magnificently, and are very believable as life long friends. All of the other smaller casting choices, such as Anna Paquin as Rogue, are also chosen very well. I must say, however, that I didn't like Sabretooth's character or the actor who played him, Tyler Mane. Although he was a good casting choice for the character, Mane didn't really impress me with his acting abilities.Another complaint I have, which may be small, is a small portion in the film in which a couple different characters do certain actions that don't fit their personalities, but solely to advance the plot. Their actions are necessary, as called for by the script, but their nature and deeds don't match up. This only occurs at a specific time that's tough to talk in depth about without spoilers, but it's still present, and stands out as a negative on the script's part.Comprehensively, X-Men is a great film. It stands out as a landmark in the superhero genre of film, and contains much enjoyment in it. Despite it being flawed, I would recommend X-Men to anyone who enjoys superhero, or action, movies.",8,0,0,17 May 2016
Spider-Man 3," An Extreme Let Down From Its Predecessors
","Spiderman 3 is directed by Sam Raimi and is the final installment of the Raimi Spiderman trilogy, after Spiderman (2002) and Spiderman 2 (2004). Now that nerdy college kid Peter Parker has got the girl, he can focus solely on being Spiderman during the day, rather than having to deal with girl drama, right? Well, when three (yes, three) new villains come to town, he must put aside his relationship with Mary Jane and fight Venom, Sandman, and Green Goblin number 2.The above paragraph sounds confusing and partly inconceivable, and that's pretty much how this whole film was. Spiderman 3 was an absolute mess, relying just on the nostalgia of fanboys to carry it. Not much was going for this film, but, to its credit, what was going for it was really good, such as direction and special effects. However, an overabundance of characters and subplots, a bad script, and some very poor acting pulled this movie way below the bar.The thing that surprised me the most about Spiderman 3 is Tobey Maguire's acting. All throughout the first two Spiderman films, Tobey Maguire was great as both Peter Parker and Spidey. However, Maguire's acting abilities in Spiderman 3 were just not present. In this installment, Maguire had to play Peter, 'bad' Peter, Spiderman, and 'bad' Spiderman, and he just couldn't handle it. It pains me to say that Tobey Maguire's acting in this film was less than mediocre, and he could've done way better, to say the least.Not much of the other actors did that great either. Both Kirsten Dunst and James Franco as Mary Jane and Harry Osborn play their same old selves, with not much going for them. As seen in the end of Spiderman 2 (2004), Harry has taken up his father's legacy of the Green Goblin, so he has a new dark side to him. However, Franco doesn't pull this off at all. His 'dark side' is more a whiny brat not willing to listen to reason about the truth of his father's death, and it got excessively annoying. Kirsten Dunst doesn't bring anything new or special to the character of MJ, and Topher Grace was probably the best actor throughout the entire film, playing Peter's competitor at work, Eddie Brock.The direction and special effects are really good, to be completely honest. Sam Raimi once again does great behind the camera, and uses his skill to film clean, nice looking action sequences. The special effects in Spiderman 3 are even slightly better than that in the first two films, which is impressive, considering how good those effects were. This may be due to Spiderman 3's bigger budget, but it still is a nice thing to see in an overall boring movie.The tiring amount of villains is really what hit this film hard. Although the audience may understand the motives and actions of Goblin, Sandman, and Venom, their characters aren't greatly developed. Sandman is just trying to collect money to help his sick daughter, which is nice and all, but his subplot changes a sturdy event that occurred in Spiderman (2002), which was a bad move on the script's part. Venom was quickly shoehorned in during the last act of the film, and his character was overall boring and quite dull. Goblin's motives were easily changeable, which took away from the character a lot. The script was also pretty bad. The entire film has some awful dialogue, and jumps around often. The abundance of subplots is very bad for the film, and screws it over in unimaginable ways. Many lines were either cheesy, or just horrible, and, without good line delivery from the actors, the script ends up being a convoluted mess, too heavily relying on characters and actors to carry the film, which just didn't happen.In conclusion, Spiderman 3 isn't completely terrible, it just is an extreme let down from the amazing heights presented in the first two installments. With poor acting, characters, and a bad script, I'd recommend Spiderman 3 to anyone who enjoys superhero (or Marvel) movies, as long as you prepare yourself for a mess before hand.",6,0,0,9 May 2016
The Terminator," A Must-See Film With One of The Most Iconic Characters of All Time
","The Terminator is directed by James Cameron and stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as the title character. In the future, 2029, to be exact, a nuclear war has passed. Any remaining humans are struggling to survive against the machines, endoskeletons that are near indestructible. The leader of the resistance is named John Connor. When the machines figure this out, they send one of their own (played by Arnie) back in time to 1984 (of course) to find and 'terminate' John's mother, Sarah Connor, played by Linda Hamilton. John realizes this, and sends his best soldier, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) back to '84 to protect his mother form the invincible machine. Kind of a confusing plot.Now, as most of anybody knows, James Cameron is one of the best directors today. He's done amazing films, such as Aliens (1986), Titanic (1997), and Avatar (2009). However great those movies are, The Terminator franchise is his best idea, much like Spielberg and Jurassic Park (1993). Although Judgement Day may be slightly better, the original is still a great film, with awesome action and break- through special effects, that still hold up.Being James Cameron, the movie looks great. His shots captivate all of the car chases, shoot outs, and explosions beautifully. The cinematography, done by Adam Greenberg, makes the film look fantastic. The acting is also truly amazing. This film was Arnie's first big role, followed closely by Commando (1985). He definitely deserves the great reputation he has today, thanks to this considerable role. Linda Hamilton also does very good, and portrays the character arc from a helpless girl to a very powerful woman that doesn't need a man next to her 24/7, unlike nowadays female characters in cinema. Alongside Hamilton, Michael Biehn also does substantial, despite the difficulty of his role.The next thing I have to mention is the dialogue. The dialogue in this film is so good. There's tons of memorable quotes extracted from this movie, including 'come with me if you want to live,' and 'I'll be back.' The lines between Sarah and Kyle is great. Their friendship is somewhat rushed, yet it doesn't feel as though it is. It feels as if we missed a point in which they got to know each other better.Although it may sound as though this film is flawless, but it's not. However, it was very hard to recognize said flaws within the movie. But, I did find one. And a quite big one. It's going to be a bit difficult to explain this issue without giving away a major plot point, but it's possible. Now, having to deal with a subject as time travel, any movie is going to have an unexplained or impossible paradox. This one has to do with the existence of John Connor, prior to the events in this film. That's all I'm going to say. However small this drawback may seem, it prevents the movie from being perfect.Overall, The Terminator is an astounding film, and anybody and everybody should see it sometime in their life. Just don't watch any of the sequels, besides Judgement Day. I'm going to give The Terminator an A, or a 9 out of 10.",9,1,2,26 February 2016
Alien," Reasonably One of the Best Films Ever Made
","Alien is directed Ridley Scott and stars Sigourney Weaver in her breakout role as Ellen Ripley, a female astronaut that belongs to a crew that receives a distress call from an unexplored planet while in space. They respond to the call by landing on the planet, and searching it. They seemingly find nothing, but, upon leaving, find an unwanted visitor aboard their ship. Once they figure out that this 'alien' is superior to humans in most every way, the film becomes a battle to either kill, or at most escape, the deadly creature.This film is widely considered one of the best horror movies of all time, and I can really see why. I can also see why some consider it one of the best films of all time. Alien is teeming with suspense, and keeps the viewer on the edge of his seat for almost the entire run time, say for some exposition in the beginning. Every time the audience gets even a subtle glimpse of the beast, each and every time there's a subtle jump, singularly due to the amazing practical effects of the alien itself.To start with some pros, the directing is utterly fantastic, to say the least. Ridley Scott does such a good job working the camera; it makes every emotion pop right out of the screen and suck the watcher right into the movie, drawing out the tone drastically. Some of the long takes can pull forth the tension throughout the scene, or the fear that a specific character feels at the present time.The acting is also amazing, starting with Sigourney Weaver. She gives one of the most breathtaking female performances in cinema history. Her character, Ellen Ripley, is a very strong and independent female; one in which no male is required to make her who she is, unlike most female leads today. If movies delivered more characters like Ripley, films would be better in almost every way.The hands down best thing about this film, however, is the simplicity of the plot. One can only imagine a person pitching the idea for this film, saying 'a crew of astronauts are stuck on a ship with an alien that kills them.' The straightforwardness of the plot is so astounding, it makes one do a double take upon the complexity of a horror, or even action, film in the modern day. This simplicity is present in many 'best films of all time,' such as Die Hard (1988), or Jaws (1975). Overcomplicated plots are one of the many reasons why too many movie goers say 'they don't make'em like they used to.'Overall, Alien is understandably one of the best films of all time, thanks to the characters, directing, and clarity of the plot. I'm going to give Alien an A+, or a 10 out of 10.",10,7,12,5 March 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," One of the Best Marvel Movies to Date, Making Captain America Seem Awesome
","Captain America: The Winter Soldier is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and stars Chris Evans reprising the role of Captain America, along with Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, and introducing Anthony Mackie as the Falcon. This film follows Captain America and Black Widow as they are forced to run and hide from S.H.I.E.LD., once the agency spontaneously turns on them. Now, there's more than a few spoilers in this film that I won't give away, but I still want to review it.Now, in my opinion, this is one of the best Marvel movies to date. It's at least on par with Spiderman 2, Guardians of the Galaxy, and possibly even The Avengers. The whole movie's tone is not the same, fun tone that Marvel took with The Avengers, or the first Captain America movie. This whole film feels like a 70's spy, espionage movie. The film is also very dark, almost like Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. It's a complete new take on Captain America and on S.H.I.E.L.D. in general.The greatest thing about the film is how bad Steve gets the life beat out of him. He has about three allies in the world, and everybody else is convinced he's a criminal. Other great superhero movies have done the exact same; beat down the hero. This was present in Spiderman 1 and 2, Iron Man, and The Dark Knight Rises. This element makes us feel for our hero, and ultimately love it even more when they come out on top.The directing and cinematography was amazing, as well. All the wide shots of the S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters, or the Triskelion, look great. The action is near perfectly directed, especially in hand to hand combat scenes. My favorite scene in this film is the fight scene on the highway between Cap and the Winter Soldier, mostly due to the action. The directing, along with the slowly rising score, make this scene as close to perfect as it gets.Now, there is an issue with this movie. And it's going to be hard to explain, because it involves a plot twist. And, not just a plot twist for this film, this twist links all the way back to the first Iron Man. So, I really don't want to spoil it for anybody that hasn't seen this movie yet. However, the twist was somewhat rushed. Yes, it was surprising, but it was thrown at the audience like a baseball. It was very rushed, and presented no evidence from the previous films in the Cinematic Universe. However, this is my only problem with the film.Overall, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is one of the best Marvel movies to date. I would give it an A, or a 9 out of 10.",9,0,1,24 February 2016
Life of Pi," Better Than Expected, With Mind Blowing Cinematography
","Life of Pi is directed by Ang Lee and is the story of a young man who, after surviving a sinking freight ship, is stranded in the Pacific Ocean with nothing but a single life boat and a tiger named Richard Parker. As older Pi is explaining the story to an author, the film goes very in depth upon the relationship between Pi and Richard Parker, and the psychological and physical journey that young Pi goes on.What I got from Life of Pi was much more than I expected. Due to the trailers and its Oscar for visual effects, I expected a color orgy with no heart to it, made purely as Oscar bait. However, Life of Pi was a lot more than that. This film was deep, and was all around a great story. There were some poor aspects of the movie, but overall it was pretty good. I really enjoyed myself when watching Life of Pi, and thought it was a great movie.As far as cinematography and special effects go, Life of Pi is a masterpiece. Few films have ever looked better than this. Almost the entire film is complete CGI, and it works on incredible levels of expertise. Besides Pi himself, and the small boat, everything was completely CG, and I was blown away. The detail on the ocean, and fish, and especially the tiger, Richard Parker, was amazing. I would honestly compare the cinematography in Life of Pi to that of Avatar (2009).The acting was fantastic as well. Suraj Sharma, who portrayed young Pi, did great. His kindness, with a burst of ferocity, was displayed on screen very well. Through most of the run time, Pi was a calm and collective young man, with a large amount of both patience and faith. However, he occasionally would have outbursts of rage, due to his situation, and Sharma pulled this off very well. Irrfan Khan, who played older Pi, also did very well. This man is already a highly respectable actor, with great capabilities, but he brought a lot to this film. His character was very wise and experienced, and this was shown greatly by Khan.Ang Lee's direction was astounding, to say the least. Each and every shot was fantastically filmed, with easily believable CGI mixed in with a real environment. During suspenseful sequences, the film lacked any shaky cam or quick cuts. Many shots were underwater, and they, especially, looked great. One particular shot which involved a sinking ship already halfway underwater looked so amazingly real my jaw literally dropped. Most of these shots were great, and added a scary depth to the oceanic aspect of the movie.Another really good thing about Life of Pi that is worth mentioning is the realness to the tiger, Richard Parker. Although his character is an animal, and is completely CGI, the film gives so many personality traits to the tiger just through his actions and relationship with Pi. Richard Parker is given more depth than most animals in film, and really grew on the audience quickly. His relationship with Pi was also very deep, which felt nice to see in the movie.Now, the main thing I disliked about Life of Pi was the first 10 to 15 minutes of the film, in which Pi's childhood is displayed. Not all of his childhood was slow, but the beginning of it was very bland, slow, and all around just not entertaining. There were a few things in Pi's childhood that actually mattered later on in the film, but there were a couple unnecessary subplots that just felt like failed attempts to flesh out both Pi and his family, and they just didn't work that well. However, once the story picks up, it really starts going, and going fast.Another thing that I felt was somewhat disappointing was a certain part in the film in which Pi finds temporary shelter. However, the film later tries to explain the shelter, and ruins the effect it had on Pi. It's hard to explain without spoilers, but it felt as if the film had just stopped, and the movie later on blows the idea out of the water, no pun intended, and makes it slightly irrelevant. Other than that, however, I didn't find any other issues with Life of Pi.Overall, Life of Pi was a really good movie. It had mind blowing visuals, great direction, and some really good acting too. I enjoyed Life of Pi, and I would recommend it to anyone who would enjoy an adventure, as long as you don't get seasick easily.",8,0,2,11 May 2016
Interstellar," Not Nolan's Best, But Still A Very Enjoyable Film
","Interstellar is directed by the one and only Christopher Nolan, and stars Matthew Mcconaughey as Cooper, an ex-pilot in a futuristic Earth, where another Dust Bowl has taken place, and Earth is no longer a suitable home for the human race. One day, Cooper and his daughter Murphy (Murph, for short) stumble upon NASA's base, who was long thought gone, and Cooper is recruited to lead a team through a wormhole next to Saturn, so that humans could colonize a different planet, and live on. Oh, and Anne Hathaway is in there, too.To start, the movie's directed by Nolan, so of course it's beautifully directed, and is one of the best looking movies I've ever seen, in terms of cinematography. All of the full screen shots of different planets, and black holes, and such look completely amazing. The score is also great (thanks Hans Zimmer). Every time anything was happening, the pounding score just sucked you right into the situation.The acting was also top notch. Matthew Mcconaughey does great as Cooper, and you really feel for him having to leave his family, particularly his daughter Murph, and the emotional impact that has on him. Anne Hathaway does great as well, although she has a pretty shallow character. Jessica Chastain does great as Murph, also portraying the emotional connection between Murph and Cooper. The whole cast do well in their roles. However, this leads into the first big negative.The characters are very washed out, and lead to a script that's too long. Casey Affleck plays Cooper's son, and his character is completely unnecessary. This character even causes a sub plot towards the end of the film, that probably adds 10 to 15 minutes to the run time. Another tacked on character would be Dr. Mann, played by Matt Damon. He obviously symbolizes mankind, and adds around 25 minutes to the film with his subplot. Overall, this movie is near three hours, mostly due to all of these subplots.Another predictable and tacked on thing is a plot twist that occurs toward the end, dealing with Murph's 'ghost.' There really wasn't much need for this, and it felt very unnecessary.Now, in conclusion, is this Nolan's best film? No. Definitely not. However, I'm not saying it's bad. It really is quite good, in all reality. I'm going to give Interstellar an A-, or a 9 out of 10.",9,0,4,21 February 2016
Romeo + Juliet," A Disappointment When Compared to the Play, But Not Too Bad
","Romeo + Juliet is directed by Baz Luhrmann and stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes as the famous star-crossed lovers and title characters, Romeo and Juliet. If you don't know the story, shame on you, but here's a synopsis. Two families, the Montagues and Capulets, are constantly feuding, and Romeo, a Montague, and Juliet, a Capulet, subsequently fall in love. Their love is not allowed, due to their parents' hatred for each other, and so they secretly get married. This entire story is based (literally line by line) off of William Shakespeare's play, The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet.The best thing this film has to offer is, quite obviously, the dialogue. The lines used in this film is the exact lines William Shakespeare wrote in the 16th century. The plot, along with the dialogue, is ingenious. The forbidden love between the two plays off amazingly. The direction in this film also is pretty good. It has a few flaws; some shaky cam, bad close ups, etc. However, it's more good than it is bad. The acting is also really good. This is one of DiCaprio's first roles, besides What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), in which he received his first Oscar nomination. He is super young here, but still does a great job. Claire Danes does great as well. She's not in many movies (thanks to Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003)), but she really should be. She does fantastic in this film. The first negative in this film is the 'gangster' vibe of it. The original story takes place in the 14th century in Verona, Italy. This film takes place in 1996 in Verona Beach, California. Nobody uses swords; they all use engraved, golden guns. This movie would've been near perfect if the director kept to the formula that Shakespeare wrote. The nowaday feel of the movie makes for a complete mess, with too much unnecessary drama at the wrong times, and confusing dialogue that makes no sense when a character says the word 'sword' or especially old English, using words like 'doth' and 'thou.'Overall, Romeo + Juliet wasn't too bad. I expected better than the utterly stupid theme of the slums, and the occasional bad direction, most abundant during fight scenes. I'm going to give Romeo + Juliet a C+, or a 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,1 March 2016
Southpaw," Another Great Boxing Film, With Jake Gyllenhaal In It This Time
","Southpaw is directed by Antoine Fuqua and stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Billy Hope, a world champion boxer who, when a certain event happens in his life, finds himself in a downward spiral towards poverty and depression. After reaching rock bottom, he meets a trainer of a boxing gym named Tick Wills, played by Forest Whitaker, and decides that the past can't, and won't get the best of him. He then works his way to the top, encountering all the people responsible for his downfall.Okay, to get it out of the way, yes, Southpaw follows the 'boxing' movie cliché. However, almost every fighting/boxing movie does. Rocky and all of its sequels, Cinderella Man (2005), Raging Bull (1980), and pretty much every other movie involving a fighter/boxer follows this formula. But, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. This is proved by Southpaw, another amazing boxing movie. Near everything about Southpaw was great, and it surprisingly had a lot of emotion to it.The best thing about Southpaw is the actors and their portrayals of the characters. Jake Gyllenhaal is amazing as Billy, especially for being just a few months out of Nightcrawler (2014). Rachel McAdams as Billy's wife, Maureen, was a great casting choice. Although she played the cliché 'worried wife,' she did it well, and it worked well for this movie. Forest Whitaker is, once again, great in his role. He plays the retired fighter very nicely, and brought a lot of life to this dark movie. Even 50 Cent (Curtis Jackson) does pretty good. 50 Cent plays Billy's agent, and plays strictly by business, and he does it well.However, despite all of the great acting throughout Southpaw, the acting that surprised me the most was that of Billy's daughter, Leila, played by Oona Laurence. This girl was only around 12 when playing this part, and gives a performance that most 30-40 year olds can't even give. She was great in every scene she was in, especially in one scene, no spoilers, when she is expressing her anger towards her father for certain things going on in their life. Her performance blew me away, and I really hope to see her in future films.The direction by Antoine Fuqua, particularly during the fight scenes, is amazing. There are specific shots during the boxing matches where the camera was in first person view, and it's very impressive. In the way that the shot was set up, the camera displays Billy's opponent punching at the screen, which is great. It immerses the viewer straight into the film, and adds a whole new level the movie's experience.Now, the only complaint I had with Southpaw was a very small one. This movie's depressing, and that's not a bad thing. Most boxing movies center around the zero-to-hero plot, and Southpaw follows this old formula, and does it very well. Maybe too well. At a certain point, the audience starts to get the sadness of Billy's life beaten over their heads so hard that it gets a bit exasperating. Although it's a good premise, the film delves into the sadness too hard at some points, and it's distracting and exhausting after awhile.Overall, Southpaw is a great movie, and is a nice addition to the boxing movie collection. I'd recommend Southpaw to anyone who can handle the violence and sadness aspects.",9,0,0,28 April 2016
Captain America: The First Avenger," A Great Superhero Origin Story With Nicely Filmed Action
","Captain America: The First Avenger is directed by Joe Johnston and stars Chris Evans as scrawny Brooklyn kid Steve Rogers, who has a passion for joining the military and serving in World War II. However, he has a long list of health issues that prevent this, so he signs up for a super soldier program. This program involves him being testing upon so that he can be stronger, faster, and all around better at physical tasks. But, when a Nazi organization called Hydra, led by a man named Johann Schmidt, better known as the notorious Red Skull, comes in contact with a powerful object called the Tesseract, Steve Rogers, now called Captain America, must put his skills to good use.Captain America: The First Avenger is actually a really good movie. Not many people expected much from this movie, but it was, overall, great. There were some issues with it, but not many, and the many positive aspects of the film highly outweighed the negative ones. The acting, direction, action, and script combine to make a respectable film that is Captain America: The First Avenger.There's an old saying that applies to film that goes: 'a movie is only as good as its villain.' This is true in almost every single film, including the first Captain America. Hugo Weaving as Red Skull was a perfect casting choice, and an immensely overlooked villain of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The character is understandable, and well rounded, which add for a great character altogether. Hugo Weaving does great as Red Skull, as expected, and put a newer spin on this older character.Hugo Weaving isn't the only capable actor in this movie, however. Chris Evans, as Steve Rogers/Captain America is not only a great casting choice, but he lives up to the hype of his abilities. His large character arc is expressed in depth all throughout this film, and Cap is a great protagonist to follow. Hayley Atwell also does substantial in her role as Agent Peggy Carter. Her two sided bitter/sweet character was displayed amazingly by Atwell, and her performance stood out as one of the best. Other smaller role actors such as Tommy Lee Jones, Sebastian Stan, Stanley Tucci, Dominic Cooper, and Toby Jones all do fine as well.The way that Joe Johnston directed the action is really good. Each action scene is cleanly cut, with no shaky cam present at all. Wide shots of snow permeated forests are very nice to look at, so props to Johnston and the cinematographer, Shelly Johnson. The score, by Alan Silvestri, is pretty nice as well. The main theme ('Captain America Main Titles') stands out to me the most as superior to the rest, however opinionated that may be. Despite my having a favorite, all of the themes are great, and add a whole lot to Cap's origin story.Now, my biggest (and only) issue with Captain America: The First Avenger is actually a big one. Once Steve Rogers becomes Captain America, the film quickly montages over many of his cool moments, and it was quite disappointing. After the audience patiently waits to see Cap in action, the film practically skips over a ton of cool scenes, and wasted a lot of potential. Parts of the film that could've been really cool turned into a massive let down. However, once the film picks up, it picks up fast, and partially makes up for its montage sequence.Besides that, I didn't have any major issues with Captain America: The First Avenger. Overall, it was a great film, and I enjoyed almost everything about it. I'd recommend Captain America: The First Avenger to anyone who likes superheroes and well filmed action.",9,0,1,12 May 2016
Predator," A Great Step Forward in the Action Genre
","Predator is directed by John McTiernan and is the story of a group of testosterone fueled men that are sent on a mission in Central America and end up being forced to fight a being much beyond their comprehension and abilities combined. This thing is targeting them all, picking them off one by one. It kills for sport and 'decorates' the dead bodies. Dutch, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger must lead his team in this battle of the fates, pitting predator against prey.Predator is easily one of the best action movies ever made. Everything contained in this film is pure masculinity, from a close up of Dutch and Dillon's (Carl Weathers) biceps when shaking hands, to Arnie covering himself in mud so that the predator's vision of him is obscured. This movie screams testosterone, and I love every second of it. However, I feel that a girl could enjoy the movie as well. It's not just a film made for manly men, it's made for lovers of action, whether that be a man, a woman, or a little kid that likes explosions and gunfire.The best thing about this film is the memorability factor. Anyone who is a regularly movie goer should be able to recall the first time they saw this film, just because of how memorable it is. At least two or three lines in this film are everyday terms, including 'If it bleeds, we can kill it,' to the ever-so-famous 'get to the choppa!' This movie is very memorable, and forever will be an icon for the action genre.The direction and cinematography throughout the film are also pretty great. Each shot captures the Central American jungle very well, engulfing the audience in the environment that these men are in. There are a few smaller jump scares throughout the movie, and the suspense is expressed very well, thanks to the camera angles, and any other element that factors into the few seconds leading to the jump, including the rising background music, and the actors' facial expression. This is how action and suspense should be filmed; not shaky cam.This leads into my next and final point, which is the acting. All of the actors, from Arnie to Carl Weathers, to Jesse Ventura (who plays Blain) do amazing. They, like mentioned before, capture the masculinity this film brings to the table majorly, and the viewer can tell they have all transformed in one way or another for their role. Arnold Schwarzenegger actually lost about 20 pounds or so for this film, because he figured that a military man would be muscular and lean, not just a barge, like he formerly was.Overall, Predator is a great step forward in the action genre, and brought many new factors to the table. The film is near flawless, and definitely deserves an A+, or a 10 out of 10.",10,1,1,8 March 2016
Oblivion," One of the Better Movies of 2013
","Oblivion was a well directed, well acted, and well written movie. I enjoyed watching it, for the most part, mostly due to the acting skills of Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman combined with the incredible visual effects.Now, to start off, I've never been a fan of Tom Cruise. Prior to watching Oblivion, I had liked only a few of his movies (War of the Worlds, Edge of Tomorrow, Mission Impossible Anthology, etc.). However, this movie has heightened my respect for the man, and his acting. I definitely think he's a good actor, but he just doesn't have diversity. What do I mean by that? He can only play action. Even though he executes his roles nicely, he doesn't do different ones very often.To give an example, Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks can play any part. He has acted as a mentally retarded man (Forest Gump), a homosexual man with HIV (Philadelphia), a war hero (Saving Private Ryan), and even a lonely crazy dude (Cast Away). Of all the roles listed, he has yet to do bad in any of them. Another good example would be Robin Williams. However, due to his MANY diverse roles, I'm not going to list them all.Next topic: Morgan Freeman. To be honest, I never thought Morgan Freeman could do a Sci-Fi film like this. However, I think he did really good in this movie. The part where the room is dark and he's speaking, and then the lights turn on, and he's sitting back in his chair, smoking a cigar, I was bought. He's really good. I frequently compare him to greats like Harrison Ford or Mel Gibson.Now, Oblivion had a good story line, but it was confusing as heck. This movie honestly confused me more than Inception, and that movie is KNOWN for being confusing. Despite it being confusing, it was still great. I loved that fact that movie had at least five 'ah ha' moments. Most movies only manage one, but Oblivion really pulled it off. Additional to that, the fact that Jack Harper, Tom Cruise's character, was lied to about so many things, and neither he nor the audience figured it out until we were supposed to, was mind blowing.The last good thing I'd like to mention about this movie was the visual effects. Wow. The visual effects in this movie were some of the best I've seen in a while. There were no moments where you said, 'Wow, that looks fake.' None, at all. And that's really impressive, considering almost every setting was full of visuals. Now, this is due to the movie's huge budget, but it was still amazing.Now, we get into the negatives. The first thing I didn't like about this movie was the scene in the very end when the audience thinks Jack is dead (which, technically, he is), and he turns out to still be alive. The scene is set where Julia, Jack's wife, is playing with her child (presumably Jack's even though no sex is implied between them whatsoever) and she looks over and sees the remaining Scavengers across a small pond. Now, we saw that Jack had died about three years prior to this, in a nuclear explosion. However, we also know that there are plenty of Jacks left on Earth. We actually got to meet one earlier in the movie, who was Jack from Tower 52. This Jack ends up traveling with the Scavengers and finally finding his wife, Julia and their son.Now that I've explained the scene, let me tell you my problems with it. First off, like I said above, it was never implied that Jack and Julia had sex. At all. No morning after scene, no actual sex scene, nothing. But apparently, they had a kid together. That makes no sense whatsoever. People can't have a kid if they haven't done the dirty. That's a fact of life.Second, if Julia woke up at the cabin, which we know she did, how the heck did she get there? My guess was that the Scavengers took her, but if they took her, then why did it take them three years to get to her again? Another problem with them taking her, only Jack knew how to get there, so how would they take her. Pretty big plot hole there. If the Scavengers didn't take her, then who did? Also, if she was there, alone, for so long, how did she have a baby? I've seen a couple baby births in my lifetime, and there are always two or three people nearby the mother to help her. But apparently, Julia can go through labor without any help. Because she's cool like that. And I'm not even going to mention the fact that the kid was at least four or five years old, even though she had only been there for three years.Lastly, the last time we saw Jack 52, he wouldn't listen to anything Jack 49 or Julia had to say. But I guess he was really open minded to the Scavengers, the people he was trained to kill. Overall, the ending scene really confused me. I really wish they could've left it at the destruction of the Tet, and not have the whole 'in the time since' scene.Well, Oblivion was, overall, really good. I obviously had a few problems with it, but not too many. I liked the plot, and loved the acting. The visual effects were also a big yes for me. It was definitely one of the better movies of 2013. After watching this movie a few times, and thinking about it a lot, I'm going to have to give it a B+, or an 8 out of 10.",8,1,2,27 January 2016
The Revenant," Surprisingly Good for January
","The Revenant is directed by Alejandro Iñárritu and is based on the true events of an nineteenth century fur trapper named Hugh Glass (Leonardo Dicaprio) and his epic tale of redemption. After he is savagely attacked by a grizzly bear, Hugh must be taken care of by his fellow expeditioners, which proves to be hard. After his team leader accepts that he is just a burden, he pays three men to stay behind and take care of him, while the rest push on forward. The three men that stay behind are Hugh's Native American son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck), a rival of Hugh's named Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), and another teenage boy named Bridger (Will Poulter). Fitzgerald eventually murders Hugh's son, buries Hugh alive, and takes off with Bridger, lying to him about Hawk's fate. Then, Hugh crawls out of his early grave to seek vengeance upon Fitzgerald.I saw this movie the day it premiered in my state, on January 8, and walked in expecting a crappy January movie, and I was dead wrong. The Revenant, I think, is definitely an Oscar worthy movie, and only competition would feature Spotlight, Mad Max: Fury Road, and The Martian. If not for those three films, The Revenant would win without a doubt. First I'll discuss the better qualities, then I'll jump into the negatives.To start off, this movie has literally the best cinematography in movie history, apart from Avatar (2009). This film looks absolutely beautiful. Some of the shots look unreal due to how amazing they look. When Iñárritu was filming The Revenant, he refused to use any lighting effects at all. Yes, obviously, the editing team enhanced it, but all lighting in the film was either form the sun, the moon, or fire. That's risky, and it worked out masterfully.Another thing was Dicaprio's acting. It genuinely makes me mad that this man has yet to win an Oscar, but if he doesn't for this film, I'll just be that much more mad. He has already won the Golden Globe for best actor, but that's just not the same. Another great performance is Tom Hardy's. Tom Hardy is already an amazing actor, but this just shows off his skill even more. He really proves himself in this movie, and shows that his abilities are barely below, if not on par, with the greats like Dicaprio.A third amazing thing about the film was the script. Prior to the live burial of Glass, there really wasn't too much dialogue throughout. It had bits and pieces here and there, mostly between Fitzgerald and Bridger, but there was still a large absence of lines. Some people will complain about this, but I think it really helps the film. This movie is supposed to be very real and wild, and in a situation like that, a man that's alone for most of the movie wouldn't really talk too much. So the lack of speaking really advances the film.Now there are some bad things to the movie, just like every other one. It's main problem is the run time. The movie is good, of course, and the plot is exciting, but the movie seemed a little too long. The movie comes in at about 2 hours and 36 minutes. Now, personally think they should've shaved off 15 or 20 minutes, and it would've been a bit better. Obviously that's a small problem, but I can't say the movie's perfect when it's not.So, overall, I would commend The Revenant for its cinematography, acting, directing, and script. After a lot of thought, I'd give The Revenant an A, or a 9 out of 10 stars.",9,1,3,26 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," Adding To Spielberg's Amazing Collection Is....
","Bridge of Spies is directed Steven Spielberg and stars Tom Hanks as James Donovan, an American lawyer that, in Cold War era 1957, is chosen to defend a captured Soviet spy named Rudolf Adel (Mark Rylance) in a court of law. He later is selected to negotiate a swap of sorts to trade Mr. Adel to the Soviets in exchange for an imprisoned American pilot, Francis Powers (Austin Stowell). This film is based off of a true story, and is truly one of the best films of 2015. I'm glad it's nominated for best picture.The best thing this movie offers is the directing. Very few films are directed perfectly, and this is absolutely one of them. The camera angles Spielberg utilizes are fantastic, and his ability to capture a whole conversation in just one shot is magnificent. The cinematography is also great. The cinematographer (Janusz Kamiński) did amazing at capturing the Cold War era, and the flips in between Germany and the United States are very distinguishable and impressive.On the contrary, the movie is long, and has about 2% rewatchability. Much like Spielberg's 1993 film, Schindler's List, the movie is a one or two time watch, and may be a two hour-thirty minute snooze-fest for action lovers. Anybody who comes to this movie expecting James Bond espionage will surely have a good nap. However, a film lover and admirer of the art of cinema will be on the edge of his seat.The acting is also great. Tom Hanks gives an amazing performance, as always, yet not very memorable, unlike Forrest Gump or Captain Miller (Saving Private Ryan). His character won't be remembered in twenty years or so, no matter the status that the film ascertains. However, Mark Rylance gives the performance of his career. Besides Stallone, Rylance is most qualified to acquire the Oscar. The only performance I really had a problem with was that of Amy Ryan in the role of Mary Donovan (James' wife). She didn't exactly do bad, but her ability to portray her disagreement with her husband in dealing with his defense of a Soviet spy.The main problem I had with this movie is everything having to do with the American spy, throughout the first 45 minutes or so of the film. It takes away from the intensity going on with Hanks' and Rylance's characters. Every time something suspenseful was happening, the film would switch over to Power's side of the story, which wasn't too interesting. His scenes were directed well, and acted well, so the blame goes to the jumpy script, although the Coen brothers (yeah, they wrote a serious movie) ultimately did well once the second act rolled around, and lifted the film up pretty high.The last thing I'll mention is the score. This is the first Spielberg movie in many years that is not composed by John Williams, and it shows. However, that's not a bad thing. This film has a really good score, and keeps the suspense up, in a style Williams doesn't often use. Not to criticize Williams; he's the best film composer working today, but the score is captured beautifully by Thomas Newman, this film adding to his collection of many other great films he's scored, such as The Shawshank Redemption (1994) and American Beauty (1999).Overall, Bridge of Spies is a great movie with a few nitpicky problems here and there. The acting is good, the script is good, and the directing is flawless. I'm going to give Bridge of Spies an A-, or a 9 out of 10.",9,2,5,27 February 2016
Warrior," Adding to the List of 'Great Fighting Movies' is...
","Warrior is directed by Gavin O'Connor and is the story of two brothers (Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton) that come from a disconnected background, and became MMA fighters. Their father (Nick Nolte) is a former alcoholic that is trying to get back in touch with his sons, but is seeming to fail. The two brothers both enter the same fighting arena, and must both learn once again how to be fighters, and, more importantly, brothers.Being a Tom Hardy fanboy, I was pumped for Warrior. I also love Nick Nolte, and respect Joel Edgerton as an actor as well, so this movie had me hooked. I thought the movie was going to be great, and I was right. Warrior is a great movie all around, with great action, and a lot of heart to it, to the point of tears. Warrior also features some great acting, from all three actors mentioned above, and more.In fact, the acting is the best thing about Warrior. Tom Hardy plays an amazing young man who doesn't like people, and just needs an output for his anger, which is mixed martial arts. Joel Edgerton also does really good. His character, Brendan, is a thirty- something year old that is in a bit of an unstable situation with his home and family. He plays this character very nicely, and adds a lot to this film. Nolte delivers yet another great performance, and plays this done-with-alcohol old man near perfectly. His chemistry with the actors that play his sons is what really carries this movie, and the acting is great.The direction, particularly during the fights, is great. O'Connor is pretty nice with the camera, and films all of the action smoothly. Rather than a shaky cam orgy, all of the cuts are paced well, and the camera near to never shakes. The script, also by Gavin O'Connor, is great. His combined skills with the camera and the pen add for some very heartfelt and tension packed scenes between the two men and their father.The only problem I had with Warrior was the back and forth element in the first hour or so. To summarize, the first hour or so is more intent on explaining the backstory between the disrupted family, and also focuses on getting all three of the main characters to the MMA tournament. Within this time period, the story will show part of Tommy's (Hardy's) life, and then some of Brendan's (Edgerton's). For this time, Tommy is being trained by his father, so those two characters are together, but the story bouncing back and forth between the two brothers is a bit distracting. Right when one side sucks in the viewer, the other takes over the film, and pulls you right out of the experience. Luckily, after the first hour or so, this stopped, and the rest of Warrior flowed evenly.In conclusion, Warrior is an amazing movie. With the combined acting, camera work, and tear inducing story, Warrior is another movie to add on the list of 'great fighting movies,' along with other giants, such as Rocky (1976).",9,3,6,26 April 2016
Spider-Man," One of the Best Superhero Origin Stories Put To Film
","Spiderman is directed by Sam Raimi and stars Tobey Maguire as the awkward high school nerd Peter Parker. On a field trip to a science lab, Peter was bitten by a radioactive spider, and gained superhuman abilities of strength, reflexes, and heightened senses. He also now has the ability to stick to walls, and to shoot spider webs out of his wrists. When a new villain comes to town, a guy that calls himself the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), Peter must handle his nerdy high school life, all while trying to save the city and the girl he loves, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).Spiderman was one of the first Marvel films ever made, right behind X-Men (2000), and it literally made my childhood. I had Spiderman posters, bed sheets, window curtains, you name it. Spiderman was a very influential movie, and still holds up to day. People still love the original Raimi trilogy (or, the first two), and most like Tobey Maguire better than Andrew Garfield (no offense Garfield fans). This film is pretty close to perfect, and I'm here to tell you why.One of the best things this film can offer is the close to perfect casting. Although Maguire might not make the best Spiderman, he definitely fits the role of Peter Parker, the high school loser that can't get anything besides his grades right. James Franco as Harry Osborn was a great choice, and was much better than Dane DeHaan with a face full of acne. Kirsten Dunst was a pretty good choice for Mary Jane, although I could've seen some other actress dye her hair red and then scream for two hours. Willem Dafoe was an amazing choice for Norman Osborn, or Green Goblin, and handled that role with a lot of confidence and pulled it off nicely. However, the best casting choice was J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson. I truly believe that this was one of the best casting choices made in a film, ever. Simmons played Jameson perfectly, and was a highlight in every film, even the third one, but we don't talk about that.Another great thing this movie pulls off is the direction and special effects. Sam Raimi is a great director, we all know that, but he does even better in these films than in the Evil Dead franchise. His work with the camera brings a feel to Spiderman that nobody else, including Marc Webb, could handle correctly. Now, the special effects in a couple parts look somewhat dated, but overall, they are really good. Most of them still hold up today, except for a couple shots here and there.The score is also an extreme highlight of the film, done masterfully by Danny Elfman. Not even the great James Horner could replicate what Elfman did, when it came time to make The Amazing Spiderman (2012). The score adds an epic sense of liveliness to the film, especially in the action scenes (more on that later). The score sounds good with the film, or by itself, which really makes for a good soundtrack.Now, the action scenes were directed beautifully, and were very clean without an over abundance of cuts, especially the end fight between Spiderman and the Green Goblin. All of the impossible jumps that Spiderman makes, or when he swings from structure to structure look amazing, and this is all thanks to Raimi and his abilities with the camera. He can make a talking scene look nice, or he can make an action scene look nice, which is a great quality for a director to have.The best thing about this film is easily the vulnerability of our hero, Spiderman. Throughout the entire movie, Spiderman gets the crap beaten out of him, both physically and mentally. His thoughts are attacked, his body is attacked, his loved ones are attacked, and this is what makes the Green Goblin a great villain. He knows all of Spiderman's weaknesses, and he strikes them right where he should. This is where the film shines most, when the hero gets his butt kicked. This is because when the hero finally rises up to overcome the seemingly impossible hurdle, it makes the audience feel all that much better about his victory. This is common in all great films that contain a 'hero', such as every film in the Dark Knight trilogy, Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), and even movies such as Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981).Now, the only complaint I had, and this is very nitpicky, is the suit of the Green Goblin. There's no way to let it down easily, he looks like a Power Ranger. Although the suit doesn't look bad, they should've gone with something a bit more realistic, and not just completely comical. If they would've done this, he wouldn't have looked like a Power Ranger, and he possibly would've looked as cool as he actually was.Overall, Spiderman is an amazing superhero movie, and an amazing movie, and one of the best origin stories put to film. I recommend Spiderman to anyone and everyone; it's worth your time.",9,2,4,30 March 2016
Aliens," One More Sequel Equivalant to That of the First
","Aliens is directed by James Cameron and is a continuation of 1979's Alien. In this movie, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), the soul survivor from the alien attack from the first film, was found floating in space after 57 years in hypersleep. When she awakes, she learns that her daughter and everyone else she knew is dead, and that a colony has since formed on LV-426, the alien planet. Once the station she's on loses signal from the colony, Ripley, along with a crew of marines, must go to LV-426, and see if there are any survivors.Rarely is a sequel as good as the first film in a franchise. This has only been present in a few film franchises, such as the Terminator franchise, the Mad Max franchise, and the Star Wars franchise. Other than those, no other films come to mind. Except for Aliens. When James Cameron decided to direct a sequel to Alien (1979), he decided to go a different route. Rather than making a horror film, he made an action movie. That was a great move on Cameron's part, and it helped him make a great film, one equal to that of the original.The hands down best thing about Aliens is the perfect mix between action and suspense. Cameron directed an action movie, not a horror, yet Aliens is surprisingly suspenseful. The suspense is especially a large factor in a specific scene, no spoilers, in which Ripley is locked in a room with a couple of facehuggers; that was white knuckled terror. Even in the action scenes when the marines are fighting the xenomorphs, suspense is present.On the other hand, the action in Aliens is abundant. In almost every scene, there's action going on somewhere. Although the first act, which involved Ripley getting back to LV-426, doesn't have too much action, the viewer is preparing themselves for it, thanks to the ingenious buildup by the script and actors. Once Ripley reaches the planet, and war breaks out between the aliens and the marines, it's non stop. Although there are breather scenes, or scenes for the viewer to catch their breath, the action almost never lets up, and keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time.Another great thing surrounding Aliens is the acting. Of course, Sigourney Weaver owns the role of Ellen Ripley, but she doesn't exactly steal the show. While Ripley is the main character, and the most interesting, all of the other characters are written and portrayed well. Michael Biehn as Hicks was amazing, Bill Paxton was great as Hudson, and Lance Henriksen was fantastic as Bishop. However, Carrie Henn as Newt was absolutely astounding. Without spoiling anything about her character, this was easily one of the best child performances of all time, especially in an action movie.The last element that Aliens deserves praise for is the basis for the storyline. After the end to the first Alien (1979), continuing the story seemed difficult, but it was pulled off wonderfully in Aliens. Not only did the script have to get Ripley back on screen, but it had to get her back to LV-426 willingly. The way that the script purposes to get Ripley back to the alien planet is perfectly convincing, but isn't brushed over either. The proposal isn't cheap, or quick, it's flawless.In the end, Aliens is equal to that of Alien (1979), critically. Personally, I prefer Alien (1979) slightly more, but they are both amazing. Anyone who likes action, space operas, or the first film in the franchise will love Aliens.",10,0,1,27 April 2016
Captain America: Civil War," My Personal Favorite Marvel Film To Date, Topping All Expectations
","Captain America: Civil War is directed by both Anthony and Joe Russo and is a sequel to 2014's Captain America: The Winter Soldier, also directed by the Russo brothers. After an accident occurred while the new Avengers were on the hunt for Crossbones, the United States government proposes that the Avengers be government controlled. Captain America disagrees with the idea, and Iron Man is all for it. This conflict in decision begins to rip the Avengers apart, starting a civil war.I was really on the edge over Captain America: Civil War. I loved both the previous two Captain America movies, and the two Avengers installments as well. Walking out of the theater, I got all I had wanted and more. Captain America: Civil War is now my favorite Marvel film to date. I loved everything about it, and was so happy to see just how amazingly well everything worked out.The Russo brothers did absolutely amazing with this movie. Not only are all of the characters flawlessly well rounded, but the direction and script are fantastic as well. The direction perfectly captured all of the action throughout the film, and was handled very nicely. Many wide shots were used, and the action was without shaky cam or quick cuts. All of the dialogue was near flawless as well. The audience is very subtly introduced to the conflict between Captain America and Iron Man, and dives deeper into it as the film progresses. The points presented by both sides are both right in there own ways, and that adds so much to this movie.The characters in Civil War are as close to perfect as it gets. I cared for every character in the film, whether they be a superhero or not. Black Panther's introduction into the Marvel Cinematic Universe was great, and I can't wait for his solo film in 2018. Spiderman in this film is, in my opinion, the best on screen Spiderman of all time. I like Tom Holland as the web head a bit better than Tobey Maguire, and way better than Andrew Garfield. His suit was great, and he delivered a lot of quips while fighting, just like the fans wanted. Lines such as 'You have the right to remain silent!' or 'You have a metal arm? That's awesome, dude!' made Spiderman near perfect in this movie. I loved the characters of both Spiderman and Black Panther.Besides the fact of the new characters, the Russo brothers also went deeper into the characters that we've already seen. Vision was given a lot more depth through Civil War, as was Scarlet Witch. The relationship between the two was great, and was given the attention it deserved. Both Hawkeye and Black Widow got a lot of screen time, and Hawkeye's relationship with Scarlet Witch, which he inspired to become an Avenger at the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), was explored more deeply, and played off very well. Black Widow's internal conflict with which team she truly supported was shown neatly, however not distracting from the main plot.Both Iron Man and Captain America were fleshed out much more than they have been before, despite how long the two have been in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Their struggles with each other was astounding at how well it was used. Falcon and War Machine were both given a lot more attention than they have been before, and that worked amazingly. As seen in the trailer, War Machine gets injured, and that gave his character a lot more depth. Falcon's friendship with Captain America was expressed more heavily, now that they know each other better. Cap's relationship with Bucky was also incredible. The exploration dealt to Bucky's character was high, and appreciated very much. And, without spoiling anything, Ant Man's character was, simply put, flawless all throughout Civil War.All of the acting was great as well. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany, Sebastian Stan, Chadwick Boseman, Jeremy Renner, Tom Holland, Paul Rudd, William Hurt, and Daniel Bruhl all did fantastic. Each performance was unique in its own way, and all of the characters were played greatly. Each actor's portrayal of his or her character was amazing, and each and every character was given the depth they deserved.Overall, Captain America: Civil War is my favorite Marvel movie to date, and my second favorite comic book movie, topped only by The Dark Knight (2008). The Russo brothers have made a true masterpiece of a film, heightening all expectations for Avengers: Infinity War Parts I and II (2018-2019).",10,71,139,8 May 2016
Independence Day," Not the Greatest Film, But Definitely a Very Fun One
","Independence Day is directed by Roland Emmerich and stars Will Smith, Bill Pullman, and Jeff Goldblum. These three characters represent an Air Force pilot (Smith), the President of the U.S. (Pullman), and a low life tech whiz (Goldblum). When aliens from outer space attack Earth, these three, along with the remaining survivors, must come together to defeat the aliens and restore freedom to the human race. This all takes place on the 4th of July, as well, because of America.To start, this movie isn't supposed to be serious, and it's not supposed to make too much sense. This film was purely made to be fun, and to entertain the audience. And that's exactly what it does. Although the movie isn't amazing critically, it's a blast in every way possible. I could watch this movie in the summer (heck, on Independence Day), when it's too hot to go outside, or on a cold winter day when I'm snowed inside the house and can't leave. This movie isn't The Shawshank Redemption (1994), but I'll watch this movie way more than I will Shawshank.Jeff Goldblum, Will Smith, and Bill Pullman do great in their roles. Will Smith plays the awesome action hero, that eventually learns to care about people other than himself, including his girlfriend and her son. Jeff Goldblum, while playing Ian Malcolm from Jurassic Park (1994), plays a good science geek, that eventually becomes another action hero. Bill Pullman is actually believable as the President, and learns that being such a high up position means more than just having the title and giving commands; you have to personally help your people.The special effects are also great; in fact, they were ground- breaking for 1996. All of the shots of alien spaceships look really believable, and the use of practical effects on the aliens themselves was very smart. The shot of an alien ship blowing up the white house was amazing; I don't know how they did that.The only real bad thing about this movie is the human's plan to take down the aliens. I don't want to spoil it, but it doesn't make sense barely at all. It's plausible, but it's about a .00001% chance that it would actually work. However, the same could be said about Bill Pullman being the President.Overall, Independence Day is a very fun movie that's hard to look at critically. It has very few cons, and revolutionary special effects. I'm going to give Independence Day a B+, or an 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,2 March 2016
Batman Begins," Debatably The Best Superhero Origin Story Put To Film
","Batman Begins is directed by Christopher Nolan and is the first installment in the Dark Knight trilogy, one of the best series of films delivered to film audiences ever. Although The Dark Knight is usually considered the best of the three movies, some do consider Batman Begins the best, and understandably so. However, I do feel it has its share of problems. Let's talk about those.Since most people know the origin story of Batman, played by Christian Bale in this film, I'll just explain what happens in this film. After becoming Batman, Bruce must face off against the one person, besides his friendly butler, Alfred Pennyworth, played perfectly by Michael Caine, that knows his real identity: his own mentor, a member of the League of Shadows, Ra's Al Ghul. Since Ra's is the one who trained him, he knows all of Bruce's weaknesses, and how to beat him. With the help of childhood friend Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) and police officer Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), Batman must save the people of Gotham from Ra's' evil plan, and the unleashment of a possibly even worse villain, Jonathan Crane's alter ego, the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy).I'll just jump into my problems with the film, and then begin with the praise. My main problem is the character of Rachel Dawes. Not the performance by Katie Holmes, or even the character herself, but more like the occupation of her in the film. It seems that the writers didn't exactly know what to do with her character at times, so she was thrown in on a useless subplot or just as a Batman love interest. I want to clarify that Katie Holmes didn't do bad at all, just the need for her character at specific points seemed useless.The only other problem I felt the movie had was the slowness of it at points. While The Dark Knight (2008) and even The Dark Knight Rises (2012) were fast-paced most of time, Batman Begins seems to slow down at times. This is most likely because it's an origin story, and it has no previous installments to build upon, but origin stories in the past have been fast paced, such as 2002's Spiderman.Now, for the praise. I love Christian Bale's Batman/Bruce Wayne. Although many people consider Michael Keaton the best Batman, I personally prefer Christian Bale slightly. Don't get me wrong, Keaton did amazing, and Bale being the better of the two is just my opinion. I also really like every other casting choice in the film. Michael Caine as Alfred was a fantastic choice, as was Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox. Cillian Murphy was great as Jonathan Crane, and Liam Neeson as Ducard was a near perfect. Katie Holmes was okay (and, I'm secretly happy with the replacement choice of Maggie Gyllenhaal), but she didn't exactly do great. Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon was one of the best casting choices in superhero movie history, up there with J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson.I also love the direction, as I do with every Nolan movie. Nolan to the camera is as Da Vinci is to the paintbrush. If Nolan didn't make films, he would probably homeless or working at a McDonald's full time, because film is truly his calling. The way he captured the image of the dark city of Gotham was perfect, due to his portrayal of the crime taking place in this city, and just how bad it his without good people around anymore, and how this downfall started with the death of Bruce's parents, Thomas and Martha Wayne. The importance of this fact also ties Bruce by birth to the crime rate in Gotham, which inspires him even more to become the caped crusader that we all know him as.The last pro I have with the film has got to be the score. Hans Zimmer, the composer for Batman Begins, is a modern day John Williams, despite how different their style is. Hans Zimmer does more of a background style, in which the audience is sucked into the movie due to the music, while John Williams' scores suck you in because of the music itself, and the music is obvious, it's not just in the background. In addition to Hans Zimmer, James Newton Howard worked on the score, and the epic team up of these two makes for a near perfect score.In conclusion, Batman Begins is one of the best superhero films, despite its few flaws, and impressed me on so many levels. It's easily one of, if not the, best superhero origin stories put to film, and is a bit underrated in my opinion. Check this movie out, I suggest it to anyone, fan of superheroes or not.",9,3,4,29 March 2016
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," A Great Addition to the 'Apes' Franchise
","Rise of the Planet of the Apes is directed by Rupert Wyatt and is the first film in a trilogy of prequels to the 1968 film Planet of the Apes, in which an astronaut finds himself on a planet completely run by apes. Rise of the Planet of the Apes displays just exactly how the apes came to power on Earth, and the early life of their leader, Caesar. Caesar was a test subject for a drug that was said to cure Alzheimer's disease, and became irregularly intelligent due to it. Once the creator of the drug, Will Rodman, smuggles Caesar home to raise him, some difficult things start to happen.After the cinematic disaster that was Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes (2001), I was very uneasy about the thought of a prequel to the original 1968 film, which still holds a landmark spot in cinematic history. However, I was completely surprised in every single way. Almost everything about Rise of the Planet of the Apes is very good, and it's easily one of my favorite films of 2011. The acting, direction, and especially special effects (namely motion capture work) of Rise of the Planet of the Apes was exactly on point, and I loved almost every minute of it.The one thing I simply have to mention about this movie is the motion capture work and acting displayed by Andy Serkis. Not only does Andy Serkis give an Oscar worthy performance (seriously, give him an Oscar) in this film, but he does some of, if not the, best motion capture work ever put to film. The incredible depth and emotion given to Caesar's character, played by Serkis, was absolutely flawless in any way possible. Serkis' performance mixed with the fantastic writing given by the script made for an all around flawless character with that of Caesar.All of the other performances are also very good. James Franco does really good in Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Although I was doubtful of his ability to play a scientist, he did very well, and exceeded any expectations I had for his performance in Rise of the Planet of the Apes. His relationship with Caesar was given a large amount of depth; the exact amount of depth it required to work in the film. Tom Felton pretty much played his best known character, Draco Malfoy (from the Harry Potter franchise), but he still played him well. His character earned much hate from the audience, which is exactly the way the filmmakers wanted it. All of the other acting, such as John Lithgow and Brian Cox, was also very good.The main issue I had with Rise of the Planet of the Apes was the smaller characters that were written in to serve a single purpose, and nothing more. Some of the characters seemed to be in the film for one specific reason, be it a setup for a sequel, or exposition for the climax and resolution of the film itself. Not many characters were like this, but there were some. Once these characters had done the actions required by the script, they were erased from the movie one way or another. This got under my skin, but was only apparent after evaluation of the film.Other than that small nit pick, I had no issues with Rise of the Planet of the Apes. I enjoyed the film overall, and it was a very fun film to watch. Great direction, amazing acting, and absolutely perfect motion capture work by Andy Serkis added for a fantastic film, revitalizing the Apes franchise.",9,0,0,16 May 2016
Django Unchained," Another Great Tarantino Film. Who Knew?
","Django Unchained is written and directed by Quentin Tarantino and follows a slave named Django, played by Jamie Foxx. While Django, and some other slaves, were on their way to their new 'masters' plantation, a German bounty hunter named Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz) stops the traveling slaves and collects Django due to his knowledge of what three wanted slave owners look like. During the process of hunting these three men, Django and Dr. Schultz go on a journey to save Django's wife, who's a slave living on a Mississippi plantation owned by the evil Calvin Candie (Leonardo Dicaprio).Being written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, I had high hopes for Django Unchained, yet I was still surprised in almost every way. The acting, direction, script, score, and pacing all make Django Unchained a phenomenal movie, and a very enjoyable one at that. At its three hour run time, Django Unchained never stops, or even slows down, at all. Every single minute of this film keeps going, and keeps you on the edge of your seat.Rarely does a film have a perfect script. However, in the case of Django Unchained, the script is nothing short of flawless. Every single line of dialogue is perfectly written, with thoughts of what has and what will happen throughout the film. The banter between characters, particularly Dr. Schultz and Django, is both compelling and hilarious at the same time. Each line amazingly builds suspense for what is about to come in the next scene, and the next, and so on. The script is truly fantastic, and is the best thing about Django Unchained, which is saying a lot.The acting is also incredible. Jamie Foxx gives the performance of a life time, portraying one of the best character arcs in cinematic history. Towards the beginning of the film, Django is still a slave, and he doesn't know whether or not he should respond to white men most of the time. However, he eventually learns that he is no less than any white man, and begins to buy nicer clothing, and talk back (both respectfully and sarcastically) to white men, and becomes his own person, complete with memorable lines and a sly, bad tone to his voice.Christoph Waltz gives one of the best supporting actor performances of all time, with great sarcasm and hilarious dialogue. Many of the lines Waltz delivered had me gut-busted laughing, thanks to both the actor and the astounding script. Leonardo Dicaprio actually gives one of the best performances of his career, playing the polite, yet ficious, Calvin Candie. His character is cruel, and has no conscience about anything he does (involving his slaves, at least), and Dicaprio plays this menace brilliantly.Samuel L. Jackson is actually in this movie, and he plays one of Candie's slaves, yet he's somehow 'above' all of the other slaves due to his abundance of time spent on Candie's plantation, self titled Candieland. He orders the other slaves, and even some white men, around, and uses the 'n' word a lot. Samuel L. Jackson, of course, is amazing in this role, partly due to Tarantino writing it with him in mind.The direction, also by Tarantino, is unexplainably fascinating. The direction reeks of older styles, with a newer vibe mixed in as well. There are many moments where the camera will zoom in twenty feet from a far off shot straight into a close up of a character's face. These great directing styles add an interesting aspect to the entire film, and make it look very nice as well. The action is also filmed very nicely, with no shaky cam or quick cuts. Each of the ridiculously violent blood splatters from a bullet wound is shown without hesitation, which adds a grotesque, yet revealing, side to Django Unchained.The score, composed by Ennio Morricone, is also exhilarating. Each main character has his own theme, from Django to Candie, and the score gives a distinct feel to each character. The smart choice of including older western songs in the film also added to the great feel of the film. Each time Django does some 'awesome' act that's noteworthy, music accompanies him as he rides off into the next scene, and makes the viewer want to pat him on the back and ride off with him.The only issue that I could see some making for Django Unchained is the run time. Although the run time is a bit long, I ask those people: what scenes would you cut out of the film? There isn't any. The run time is lengthy, yes, but the story of Django is a long one to tell, so all support to Tarantino for making the film as long as he saw fit, because if it was any shorter, people would complain about its rushed script and plot holes, so I see the run time as fit at three hours.Overall, Django Unchained is a fantastic film, with great direction, acting, music, and a flawless script. I'd recommend Django Unchained to anyone who can handle the over the top violence, because there is a lot.",10,1,4,22 May 2016
Bolt," An Exceptional Animated Film by Disney
","Bolt is directed by Byron Howard and Chris Williams and is the very original story of a dog that regularly stars in an action/adventure television show. Despite it being a fictional television show, Bolt, the dog, believes in every second of it. When he mistakenly gets shipped from Hollywood to New York, Bolt must, with the help of new companions Mittens the alley cat and Rhino the small hamster, get back to Penny in order to save her from the threat that he wholeheartedly believes is real.Bolt is, as far as animated films go, one of the most underrated films ever created. With its combined amazing voice acting, animation, and very clever writing, Bolt is a great film, with a lot of style and substance. Coming from Disney in a dark streak of theirs, Bolt didn't have any expectations from me, yet it impressed me on every level. The low amount of recognition Bolt gets is unacceptable, because it is a substantial film.The voice acting is what really elevated Bolt to the next level. The talent of John Travolta, Susie Essman, and Mark Walton add for a great team littered throughout the film. John Travolta pulls off the brave, big hearted Bolt with a passion that live action actors can't usually bring to an animated movie. Both Susie Essman and Mark Walton as supporting characters Mittens and Rhino back up the lead role with a large amount of vigor, and play their characters considerably.The animation is top notch for the standards held these days, and impressed me greatly. The animators smartly knew to blur the background while giving the foreground much detail, which, overall, made the characters pop like a bubble. Each and every character stood out, be it Bolt, the superdog, or Penny, his 'human.' Although the background was blurred, like mentioned above, it doesn't look cheap. None of the animation looks rushed, and it all looks very clean.My main issue lies with some conveniences thrown into the plot. Despite Bolt's target audience being smaller children, it was obviously directed somewhat to an older age as well, proved by its tear inducing moments cluttered throughout the movie. At certain times in the plot, the characters may be in a place in which the writers didn't seem to have a plan to get out of, yet, soon enough, a large factor in the film will suddenly purpose itself, and everything will work out for our heroes. Although this issue isn't that prominent, it really bothered me, and took enjoyment away from film altogether.The clever writing in Bolt impressed my on a very large scale. Almost all of the dialogue, particularly between the characters of Bolt and Mittens, is absolutely flawless, with great banter and sly exposition thrown in the middle of it all. Once thing going for this is the difference between their species, a dog and a cat. Their characters' contrast added for a great relationship between the two of them; a relationship the entire audience can relate to.Another minor issue I found in Bolt was the slow exposition. Due to the extravagant plot, the film takes its time to set up for the adventure that's about to come. Once the adventure kicks into gear, the film begins to move very quickly, but the exposition seems to drag on just a tad too long. If the script would've removed a few unnecessary characters, namely a pair of annoying cats, then the first fifteen minutes (or so) may have moved faster.The last thing I have to mention about Bolt is the fantastic score. The musical score, composed by John Powell, is absolutely golden. Every single minute that any sort of action was taking place, the score was pounding, demanding that the audience sit on the edge of their seats. The viewer already cared about the characters, and their goals, but with the astounding score booming from the speakers, the audience begins to care all that much more about everything that's taking place in the film.Overall, Bolt is one of the best animated films that Disney has made in a long time. Pretty much anyone will relate to, and enjoy, this excellent movie.",8,1,2,22 May 2016
Frozen," Not A Horrible Film, But Very Bad On Disney's Standards
","Frozen is directed by Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck, and is one of Disney's newest animated movies. The story follows Anna (Kristen Bell) and her older sister Elsa (Idina Menzel) as Elsa reveals to their kingdom of Arendelle that she has secret ice powers, and immediately runs away to build an ice castle and be alone, freezing Arendelle in the process. Anna must team up with mountain man Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and his reindeer Sven, along with little snowman Olaf (Josh Gad) in order to find her sister and thaw out their frozen kingdom. To start, I enjoy Disney movies, when they're good. I'm not bias against this movie at all. I wish it would've been good, but it just wasn't. The same old Disney formula was used here, utilizing dead parents, a female heroine that needs a man (in this case, two), and a 'funny' supporting character. This formula has been used so much, it's almost like watching parts of the same story over and over. This is why Disney movies such as Big Hero 6 (2014) and Wreck-It- Ralph (2012) are such a breath of fresh air from Disney, and are generally good films. The best thing I can say about this film is the music. This move has the best music in a Disney movie since The Lion King (1994). With songs like 'Do You Want To Build A Snowman?' and the ever so famous 'Let It Go,' It has some pretty good music. Then it has 'For The First Time In Forever.' This song is good, yes, but, it's taken straight from the movie Tangled (2010). All Disney did is change the verses. and insert it into this film's soundtrack. However, the music is still the best thing this film has going for it.The first horrible thing this movie brings to the table is it's elaborate plot. The plot sounds simple, indeed, but there's so many subplots in this film that it's truly hard identifying the overlying, main plot. To list some of them: unfreezing Arendelle, Anna making friends with Elsa, Anna marrying Prince Hans (Santino Fontana), Anna marrying Kristoff, etc. I've narrowed it down to the first two listed above, but I can't figure out which one is the predominant plot.However confusing the plot is, I do have to mention the directing and animation. The animation, mostly, is very good in this film. There's absolutely no complaints to be had with it. There are no ugly shots in the movie at all.The last thing I'll mention is the character, mostly Anna. To save least last, I'll start with Elsa. Elsa honestly isn't too bad of a character, but she is a confusing one. Her emotion is hard to read, but that, at points, is a good thing. Overall I'd say Idina Menzel does pretty good as Queen Elsa. Kristoff is a good quality character as well. His funny relationship with Sven, a reindeer, is probably the most funny thing in the entire film. This leads me into the next character: Olaf. Olaf is a snowman that tries to be the Timon and Pumbaa (from The Lion King) of this movie. However, Timon and Pumbaa were likable, and fun. Olaf just isn't. Josh Gad doesn't do great with this character, however, he doesn't exactly good bad either. Olaf is ultimately okay. Just that.The last character, and definite worst thing about this whole movie is Anna. Anna is a princess that constantly needs a prince. She's not a strong female character at all, and is very disappointing all around. To compare to another Disney princess, I'll use Belle from The Beauty and The Beast (1991). Belle was a strong, independent woman that went alone to save her father, due to none of the 'tough' men in the entire town volunteering to help. She was at first imprisoned by the Beast, and fell in love with his personality, and what's on the inside, despite his monstrosity of an appearance. Anna falls in love with Prince Hans due to his title: prince. Just due to his money and role in society, she falls for him. This makes Frozen a disappointment for any female character.Overall, Frozen has a messed up plot, and upsetting characters, mixed with great animation and wonderful music. It's definitely the worst Disney film since The Emperor's New Groove (2000). I think Frozen deserves a C, or a 6 out of 10.",6,5,9,27 February 2016
Room," Easily One of the Best Films of the Year
","Room is directed by Lenny Abrahamson and is the story of a woman named Joy (Brie Larson), who was kidnapped and imprisoned in a woodshed for 7 years. While living there, she had a son named Jack (Jacob Tremblay), who sees their 'house' in a different perspective than that of his mother. Jack has never seen the outside world, and believes that there is nothing beyond their room; just outer space. This film follows the two as they plan a daring escape, and have to face something much bigger than their room; the world.To start, the Academy was smart to nominate Room for best picture. This movie is a masterpiece. It's one of the best films of the year, and it's very close to being the best. Room, while being a different story, is amazing. The plot and dialogue is absolutely perfect. There's no a thing wrong with the plot (no holes), and nothing wrong with the dialogue, either. The directing was also amazing. The way the directing makes a tiny room seem as big as the universe is fantastic.The acting was definitely the best part about the entire movie, and that's saying something. Jacob Tremblay is only 9 years old, and delivered one of the best child actor performances in cinema history. I honestly think this kid will land many more roles, and continue to give us even performances, just like this one, or maybe even better, though that doesn't seem possible. Brie Larson also does great in her role. She plays a conflicted woman, going through something she doesn't understand astoundingly. Every line that she gives is truly astonishing.Now, although the movie's great, there are a couple negatives. They are nitpicky, yes, but they're negatives. The first one is that of William H. Macy's performance as Joy's father. Not only is the performance pretty bad, the character isn't the greatest either. Macy's character is not ready at all to handle the return of his daughter, let alone that she has a son. Luckily, this character is only in the film for 10 minutes or so.The only other negative is that the film moves a bit slow, mostly in the second act. The first act can drag a little, but the second act moves pretty slowly. The second act takes place after Jack and 'Ma' escape, and their getting home and used to life in the world. This seems to take much longer than it really is, and that slows the movie down a little. However, it's not enough to make the movie bad, or even not amazing. Not nearly enough.Overall, Room is one of the best films of the year, and it definitely deserves an A, or a 9 out of 10.",9,1,5,1 March 2016
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Ben Stiller Does Great in Front, as Well as Behind, the Camera
","The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is directed by and stars Ben Stiller as Walter Mitty, a man with a boring job and boring life. Most everyone that works with him makes fun of him, mostly because he zones out a lot. He daydreams. He daydreams of himself being a Latin mountaineer, or saving Cheryl's (Kristen Wiig), a woman he's interested in, three legged dog from a building explosion. At his job, he processes negative photographs, sent from a mysterious man named Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn). One day, he doesn't receive a particular negative from Sean; the one he claims is his best photo yet. After too much pressure from his superiors, he takes off and goes on a real life adventure to find Sean, taking him to Greenland, Iceland, and Afghanistan.To start, this film is directed beautifully. Ben Stiller does a great job in front of, as well as behind, the camera. The cinematography is some of the best cinematography of the 21st century. I'd even dare to compare it to Avatar, especially since these shots are real life, and not CGI. The wide shots of mountain landscape in Afghanistan, or the volcano is Greenland is amazing. Ben Stiller's camera work is really good, which isn't too common in actors-gone-directors, but he does great.The acting is also pretty good. Ben Stiller, like I said, does great on both sides of the camera. Kristen Wiig does good as well, which was unexpected. Sean Penn, given the little screen time he has, does amazing. He really owns the role of a danger-seeking photographer. Adam Scott, with his fake beard, plays a great jerk- off boss; constantly making fun of Walter and calling his 'Major Tom.' There's also a child actor in this film, and he's about 12 or so. He does okay, but didn't really excite me in his performance like I wanted him to. He just seemed like a normal kid trying to act in a middle school play.The plot seems a bit weird, but it plays off very well. The film was based off of a short story, written by James Thurber. It's hard to turn a short story into a feature length film, but this movie does it, and does it very nicely. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty also has some good comedy. There's a scene in this film that pokes fun at The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008), and it's freaking hilarious. That's all I'll say, because I don't want to spoil anything.The main negative in this film is a certain character. It's hard to talk about this character without spoiling anything, but his name is Todd. Todd is periodically in the movie, and almost for no reason. Towards the end of the film, the audience gets to see why he was placed there, but it feels like a rushed excuse. It seems as if the writers got to a certain point, and got stuck on finding a way out. So, they threw Todd in random places throughout the movie, just so they could get out of a sticky situation.Overall, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a really good film, and I quite enjoyed watching it. I think the movie's pretty underrated, and deserves a bit more credit than what it's received. I'm going to give The Secret Life of Walter Mitty a B+, or an 8 out of 10.",8,3,3,2 March 2016
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Adding to Fincher's Collection of Masterpieces is...
","The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is directed by David Fincher and stars Brad Pitt as Benjamin Button, a man who was born in his old age, and ages backward, eventually as a baby. Throughout his life, he meets many people and experiences many things. These things are to teach lessons about life, and that's it's life is hard, no matter who you are or what your profession is.This is David Fincher's only PG-13 movie, so it's kind of out of his ball park. However, he made the film very well. The directing is great, and the cinematography really captures which time period Benjamin is currently in, whether it be the 1920's, or the 1960's. Fincher uses the camera so perfectly, the audience gets sucked into what's happening and forgets that they're watching a movie.The acting in this film is also amazing. Of course, Brad Pitt does fantastic, especially when pulling off the role of an old man. He plays a 70 year old, a 50 year old, a 30 year old, and a 16 year old all throughout the film, and he portrays the struggle of such a condition beautifully. Cate Blanchett as Daisy was good. It didn't really hook me, or present anything new to the film, but it definitely didn't bring it down at all.The score also depicts the time period very well. Early in the film (the 1920's) the viewer can subtly hear old fashioned radio music quietly in the background. Later on, in the 1940's, you can hear popular jazz or such that described that era. Finally, in the 60's, there's a Beatles song that plays (Twist n' Shout), showing the time period without even giving it away verbally.The above paragraph also leads into my next point: the cinematography. The cinematography illustrates the time period wonderfully. In the first act, everything is gloomy, due to the economic crash of 1929, leading into the Great Depression. Later, everything is more modern, yet not too modern. Streets are dark at night, and snow is on the ground. This shows the trouble that was World War II; whether Benjamin be in the United States or in Russia. Later, surroundings are more colorful and vibrant. This depicts the Vietnam/drug era. All of the decades are masterfully.The only real issues I had with this film is the progressiveness of it, and the timing in which the movie cuts back to present day (2005). In some portions of the film, nothing of importance will happen for 15 minutes or so. In other parts, three very significant things will happen within 20 minutes of each other. This balance throws the movie off in a way, and confuses the audience.My other issue with the movie is the timing of cuts to present day. While I won't say what happens in the present, I will say it's timing is very off. There will be times when the viewer is paying close attention, and the film cuts to 2005. This is very distracting, and sets back the audience. To your average movie goer, this won't be a big deal, but to a film enthusiast who watches movies the way a painter looks at Vincent Van Gogh's art work, it's offsetting.In conclusion, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a great film. It may bore some people, but I was very entertained, say for some of the present day scenes. I think The Curious Case of Benjamin Button an A-, or a 9 out of 10.",9,0,1,3 March 2016
The Nightmare Before Christmas," An Amazing Animated Film With Compelling Characters and Superb Music
","The Nightmare Before Christmas is directed by Henry Selick (no, not Tim Burton), and is the story of Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King, and the leader of Halloweentown. After years of seeking something more than simply scaring people annually, Jack eventually wanders off in thought, and stumbles across Christmastown. He decides that Christmas is a superior holiday to that of his Halloween, and sets up a plot to overthrow Santa Claus and control Christmas as his own, with good intentions for the special day of the year.Growing up, The Nightmare Before Christmas was one of my favorite movies. I had every song memorized (except for 'Something's Up With Jack,' I could never remember that one), and loved every single character in the film. Rewatching it recently, it isn't a perfect film, but it sure is a really good one. From the fantastic music, to the compelling characters, to the incredible stop motion animation, everything about The Nightmare Before Christmas is simply amazing.To start by jumping in, the hands down best thing about Nightmare is the music. The music, composed and partly sung by Danny Elfman (voicing Jack when singing), is absolutely fantastic. Almost every song is excellently written, and choreographed (with small figures on tiny sets, may I add). However, the music is also where my one problem lies. There is one specific song, called 'Making Christmas,' a song in which doesn't hold up a fight against the other songs in the film. To be completely honest, it isn't a bad song, but, in comparison to the other songs, it stands out tremendously. Besides that one song, however, the music is superb, and a soundtrack worth buying.The characters, along with the actors who voice them, is another astounding thing about The Nightmare Before Christmas. Jack Skellington is, in my opinion, one of the greatest animated characters of all time. He stands up there with Grumpy (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs), Simba (The Lion King), and Woody (Toy Story). He is perfectly well rounded, and is a flawless example of a character that literally anyone can relate to. The entire audience can find at least one attribute of Jack's that that specific person can communicate with. Jack Skellington is one of my personal favorite animated characters of all time.All of the other characters are great as well. Sally, the rag doll, and Jack's sort-of love interest is an amazing character. Her insecurity on whether or not Jack's plan of owning Christmas is a great attribute that adds a subtle layer of conflict between her and Jack. The actress that voices her, Catherine O'Hara, does great with her character, especially in the song she sings, entitled 'Sally's Song.' The main villain of the film, Oogie Boogie (or the Boogie Man) is a very clever choice for a villain for a movie that takes place in 'Halloweentown.' His weakness, which I won't spoil, was a brilliant idea to add to the film, and gives a layer of humanity to a seemingly unstoppable villain. His voice actor, Ken Page, does amazing in both speaking and singing. Every other supporting character is great as well, but just aren't filling as big of roles as the three actors/characters mentioned.The stop motion animation is nothing but the best. For every second of film, around 12 shots were taken of the small sets. That is absolutely incredible. The time that the filmmakers spent on getting the exact right shots and movements is substantial, considering it took three years for the film to be completed. For every person involved in the filmmaking, I commend you on the excellent job you did, this coming 23 years after the film's release.In final conclusion, The Nightmare Before Christmas is an amazing animated film, a great holiday film, and an excellent movie all around. I implore anyone, except for a hand full of small children, to check out this film; it's, simply put, brilliant.",9,1,1,22 June 2016
Guardians of the Galaxy," One of the Greatest Marvel Films to Date, and That's Saying Something
","Guardians of the Galaxy is directed by Peter Gunn and is the story of a human named Peter Quill, who was abducted by an alien group called the Ravagers as a boy. Once in space, he becomes a sort of smuggler, branching off from the Ravagers and doing his own thing. Eventually, a dealer asks him to retrieve a specific orb for him that resides on an abandoned planet called Morag. Upon retrieving the orb, he learns that a warlord named Ronan is also wanting the orb, along with a few others. Peter, and a few friends, have to prevent the vicious Ronan from gaining the orb, and save the day. They're the space Avengers.I really didn't expect this movie to be good; I thought it was going to be trash. However, Marvel proved, once again, that they can make some good movies, and Guardians of the Galaxy is definitely one of them. Almost everything about this film was great, and exceeded my expectations in every way possible. Guardians is funny, crude, action packed, and pretty deep as well. The script and actors juggle all of these elements so well, and really make for a great time with a movie.The best thing about Guardians is the characters. Peter Quill, or Star Lord, is great lead character, played excellently by Chris Pratt. Zoe Saldana was great as Gamora, proving yet again that she is really good at playing sexy, multi colored aliens. Although he only repeated the same line in different tones, Vin Diesel was awesome as Groot, and brought a sort of intimidation to the character. Dave Bautista was a perfect choice as Drax, and his traditional way of speaking added a lot of humor to more than a few scenes.Rocket Raccoon. I honestly thought that Rocket was going to be an annoying little rodent that was supposed to be funny, yet none of his humor would be pulled off well. I basically thought that Rocket was going to be the Jar Jar Binks of this movie. Wow, I was wrong. Rocket Raccoon was one of the best things about this entire film, and I loved every minute that he was on screen. Bradley Cooper did such a good job as this character, and brought so much comedy to the already funny film.The direction was great. James Gunn did a really great job with the camera, and used a great style during both action scenes and exposition scenes. His limited amount of cuts during the action really helped the movie, considering a lot of the action was space ships flying around each other. That's another great thing about Guardians: the special effects. All of the CG looks great, including Rocket, Groot, and all of the space battles. Particularly during the battle at the climax, the special effects were great.Now, I did have a problem with this movie, and that problem was the villain, which I was really disappointed with. With many Marvel films, the villain is pretty boring or bland. This includes the Abomination (The Incredible Hulk), Whiplash (Iron Man 2), The Mandarin (Iron Man 3), and Malekith (Thor: The Dark World). Adding to that list is Ronan, the underdeveloped villain of Guardians of the Galaxy. Although his background is covered, it's very brief, and if anybody tunes out his introduction scene, then he's just a bad guy who is bad...and a guy. That's about it. He doesn't have too much character development, and is pretty boring altogether.Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy was a great movie, and would be perfect in every way if it just wasn't for that villain. You should definitely check out this film, because it's really worth your time.",9,0,5,16 April 2016
8 Mile," Somewhat Disappointed
","8 Mile is directed by Curtis Hanson and stars Eminem (obviously), Kim Basinger, and Brittany Murphy. Before I start, let me just say I am a huge fan of Eminem. I listen to his music often, and think he's an amazing musician. However, this has nothing to do with my opinion of the movie.I have wanted to see this movie for a long time, but never got the chance to until recently, and I was pretty disappointed. I was hoping to see Marshall Mathers, and some other people in his life, like Kim (I'm sure most of you have heard of her). However, I got Jimmy Smith and Janeane. Yeah, they changed the names. This kind of made me mad. Eminem is a millionaire, and he couldn't pay for the rights of one person (obviously he wouldn't have to pay for his own). This was easily my main problem with the movie. Anyways, now that I got that off of my chest, I can move on.Some of the good points on this movie would start with Marshall's ability to rap. I mentioned earlier that he is an amazing musician (my opinion, of course), but his rapping abilities in this movie impressed me even more. On top of that, he is a pretty decent actor. That actually leads me to my second problem. I only cared about B Rabbit. I didn't care for any other of the characters at all, which was really a let down.The second positive would be the story line. This is a true story, as you should know, about the rapper Eminem and how his early life was. The storyline is great, and inspires a good message: don't let anybody put you down. Throughout the whole film, a group of buddies from across 8 Mile give 'Jimmy' trash, and he ends up winning the rap battle at the end, and makes the other guys look like complete idiots. I enjoy moments in movies where the 'bad guy' gets what he deserves. There are a couple of plot holes, but it's still a great story, nevertheless.Now, for the negatives.First off, this whole movie was dull. Now, I understand that it takes place in Detroit, and that's a horrible place, but the whole movie looks grey, and depressing, and just ugly. If they would've added a little color every here and there, it would've looked much better, in my opinion.Other than the color, the flat characters and the name changes, I don't really have any other problems with it. I didn't enjoy it like I thought I would, but I definitely wouldn't say it was bad. Overall, I would have to give 8 Mile a B, or a 7 out of 10.",7,0,1,27 January 2016
Jurassic World," Highly Overrated, but Still a Very Fun Dinosaur Flick
","Jurassic World is directed by Colin Trevorrow and is the long awaited sequel to the Jurassic Park trilogy, especially after the bomb that was Jurassic Park III (2001). This movie takes place once the dinosaur theme park known as Jurassic World has been open and successful for some time now. However, people seem to be getting bored of dinosaurs recently (we'll talk about that later), so the park manager, a young woman named Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), orders the genetic assembly of the most scary dinosaur ever seen, the Indominus Rex. Once this beast breaks loose upon the island, Claire, a raptor trainer named Owen Brady (Chris Pratt), and Claire's two nephews (Ty Simpkins, Nick Robinson) must try to defeat the dinosaur, while also trying to survive.This film is highly overrated. Coming out of the theater on June 12, the release day, I heard people saying it was ten times better than the first Jurassic Park (1993). Really? Better than one of the best movies ever made? I don't think so. However, that doesn't mean it's bad. This film is actually a very fun movie to watch. I enjoy it a bit more, in fact, each time I watch it. But it's not perfect.The best thing this film has to offer is the mix of special effects and dinosaur action. Every time a dinosaur got into a fight, whether it be with people or another dinosaur, look amazing. None of the special effects look fake at all. All shots of the Indominus Rex look very real, and never look even near bad. This even occurs towards the beginning, before any chaos is even happening . The action with dinosaurs is very abundant as well, and is directed very nicely. All action shots are very clean, and usually wide when CGI was in use.The worst thing this film has to offer is the subplots. One in particular is a certain character trying to militarize Owen Brady's raptors. Yes, there is a character wanting to make soldiers out of dinosaurs. This subplot is completely unnecessary and should've been wiped clean from the script. If this subplot didn't exist, the film would be much better. Another pretty useless subplot is background with the children. Not that the children are bad characters, but the back story with their parents and their home life could've been easily taken out of the film, and Jurassic World would've been better off.Chris Pratt. This man has truly proved himself as an amazing actor, after Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), and especially now after Jurassic World. There's been a lot of talk of Pratt portraying Indiana Jones in Indiana Jones 5, but I'm truly confident in him being this ever-so-loved character if that's the decision that is made. After the trailer hit, there's been a lot of talk about Bryce Dallas Howard, and whether or not she would do good in this movie. Well, she did. She was one of the highlights, equipped with a major character arc, and good on screen charisma. Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson also did rather well, despite their characters not being all that interesting.This leads me into my next and final point, the characterization, especially of Zach and Gray, the two kids. Zach is the older brother of Gray, and actually has a pretty good arc within their relationship later on, but it takes a while for this to fully kick in, and that is a little frustrating. Their background, like mentioned before, is a useless subplot, and could've been removed altogether. However, both actors did pretty good, despite my expectations.Overall, Jurassic World was not perfect, and pretty overrated. However, it was very fun, thanks to Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard's performances, great visual effects, and very cool action. Jurassic World deserves a B+, or an 8 out of 10.",8,17,28,9 March 2016
Blood Diamond," A Very Underrated Film That Deserves More Attention
","Blood Diamond is directed by Edward Zwick and is the true story of Denny Archer, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, a smuggler who, in the middle of a civil war in Sierra Leone, meets a fisherman named Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) that is the only man who knows the location of a giant diamond, buried deep underground. With the help of a news reporter named Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), they must find the diamond, and Solomon's family, before the native rebels, or the British military, find it, or them.This film is very underrated. I wouldn't say it's one of DiCaprio's best, just because of the rest of his filmography, but it really is a great movie. I only had a couple of complaints, and that's really saying a lot. Although Edward Zwick, the director, hasn't really done too much, he really does a great job with the camera work. Every shot captures the African landscape beautifully, and really pays respect to the film's cause.The acting is also amazing. DiCaprio, as always, does fantastic, and Djimon Hounsou does really well too. I've seen him in other stuff, namely Gladiator (2000), but he really shines in this movie. I would even go as far as to say that this is his best work. Jennifer Connelly does really well, and also sticks out, in a good way. She plays a strong female role, without having to have a man beside her, despite the inevitable romance in the film.The action in the movie is very well directed, and is paced well. There's no sequences of non stop action, but there's not any boring parts either. The action scenes and drama scenes are spaced evenly, and add to the film in a good way. The hand to hand fights were very well choreographed, as were the firefights. The last pro I have is the score. The score for this, done by James Newton Howard, really pounds into you the feel of the movie, and really won't let you forget the theme. This film was mostly made to let privileged people know what life is like in third world countries, and it does a great job at it, especially with the ending, where the score was at its peak, despite how good it was through the whole film.The only real complaint I had with this film is the transition of scenes toward the middle. Now, this is a bit confusing, but I can explain it. Say in one scene, it would show the character of Danny talking with Maddy, then the next scene would show Danny and Solomon having a conversation. Now, this is a problem because the movie doesn't explain where the other character, be it Maddy or Solomon, is at the current time. Not all scenes were like this, and this is very nitpicky, but I would've just preferred a bit more clarification.In short, Blood Diamond is a very underrated film, and worth anybody's time. I suggest you check it out, and even buy it on Blu- Ray; you won't regret it.",9,1,1,28 March 2016
Alice in Wonderland," Tim Burton Makes Another Lousy Movie. Not Good. Not Bad. Lousy
","Alice in Wonderland is directed by Tim Burton and stars Mia Wasikowska as Alice Kingsley, the ever so famous Disney not- princess. This story is the sequel to - that's right, not a remake - of the Disney classic Alice in Wonderland (1951). Alongside Wasikowska is Johnny Depp as the mad hatter, Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen, and Anne Hathaway as the White Queen. This story follows Alice at about age 20, on her wedding day, in fact as she falls down the rabbit hole yet again, to find that Underland (that's right, she 'misheard' the name the first time) is under rule of the Red Queen, or the Queen of Hearts. Under her rule, Underland is now in dismay, and mostly in chaos.The best thing this film has going for it is the cinematography and directing. Tim Burton, of course, is a good director, and this film shows it. Honestly, this film is beautiful to look at. It's almost all CGI, and almost none of it looks fake. I could tell that a couple shots looked unbelievable, mostly with the White Rabbit, but other than that, it looks great. This is probably due to their big budget of $200 million. However, it doesn't seem that big compared to what they made: $1 billion.Now, the negatives are more abundant. The first one is the acting. Even Johnny Depp doesn't do that great, and he's an A list actor. Mia Wasikowska does fine. That's all; not good, but not bad either. Just fine. Anne Hathaway does pretty good, although her character is utterly boring. Helena Bonham Carter is definitely the best performance throughout the whole film. We all know she's a good actress, but compared to Johnny Depp, she shouldn't outshine him, which makes for a problem.The second con is the plot. The plot and dialogue, to be specific. This film's plot has a very convoluted plot, that, at times, doesn't make sense, and completely ditches the audience. My first time watching it, I thought that the Red Queen was a completely different person that the Queen of Hearts from the first movie. I didn't figure out they were the same person until more than half of the way through the film.The last thing I'll discuss is the ending. This isn't really a spoiler, because I won't say what she does at the ending, just what it's based on. Alice has to become a 'champion' for the White Queen (fully dressed as a knight), and fight the Jabberwocky, a name mentioned in the original Alice in Wonderland poem. The Jabberwocky is a giant, dragon-like creature that can spew fire from it's jaws. Yeah, the ending is very, very.dumb.Overall, Alice in Wonderland isn't horrible, but it's far from good. I'm going to give Alice in Wonderland a C-, or a 6 out of 10.",6,0,1,27 February 2016
Avatar," Better Than What Most People Give It
","Avatar is directed by James Cameron and stars Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, and ex-marine that is paralyzed from the waist down. The story follows Jake as he takes up his late twin brother's position on a space exposition to a planet called Pandora. There, he is recruited for an Avatar program, in which his conscious is transferred to a Na'vi's (the locals) body, in order to gain their trust so that humans can harvest a certain metal found on Pandora.Now, the cool thing is to hate on Avatar, but I like it. It definitely isn't the best films out there, but it's certainly not bad. To jump right in, this movie has the best cinematography in cinematic history. This film is absolutely beautiful. The wide shots of Pandora and all of the wildlife sucks you in every time you watch it. The directing is also good, which is expected of James Cameron. The editing is good, which is obvious due to this movie being in production for 12 years.The biggest negative starts with the acting. However, only in one spot. Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Michelle Rodriguez, and Stephen Lang do amazing in their roles, and make set the tone for the acting. However, the tone is ripped down by the main role, played by Sam Worthington. For anyone who's seen Clash of the Titans or Terminator Salvation, you know that Sam Worthington isn't a good actor. He actually does better in this film that the others mentioned, but he still doesn't do well.Another nit picky negative is the symbolism for the movie Dances With Wolves. I think that Dances With Wolves is a very good film, and many aspects of this movie come from that of Dances With Wolves. However, nobody can call it a direct copy, just because there are similarities. Another positive is the score. The score for this film is vigorous. Props to James Horner, one of the best movie composers out there, for the score. Some of the scenes where Jake is flying on his Ikran, the pounding score enthralls me every time I watch it. This also leads me to the topic of rewatchability. I've watched this movie plenty of times, and it doesn't really get old. That is a big positive for this film.Overall, I think Avatar is much better than most people say it is. The directing, cinematography, score, and mostly good acting easily outweigh the bad acting and similarities with other films. Avatar gets a B+, or an 8 out of 10.",8,3,5,15 February 2016
A Beautiful Mind," Ron Howard's Best Film Since Apollo 13
","A Beautiful Mind is directed by Ron Howard and star Russell Crowe as John Nash, a brilliant man that attended Princeton during the late 1940's and early 1950's. He is eventually recruited, in secret, by the government, to break codes involving an atomic bomb hidden somewhere in Europe. Soon after, things take a psychological twist, leaving John to wonder what's real, and what's not. Now, I can't talk about this movie too much in depth, because there's a plot twist about halfway through that I don't want to spoil, but I'll still review it.To start with some pros, this movie is amazingly directed, much like Ron Howard's other films. It also looks great, with an ever changing cinematography based on the decade the setting is currently in. The movie is mostly set in the 50's, but it also shows some time in the 40's, 70's, and 90's as well, and all these time periods are very distinguishable from one another, thanks to the cinematography and directing.Also, the acting is amazing. Russell Crowe as John Nash is a perfect casting choice. Crowe does great as a man in Nash's situation, and really fits in the role. Paul Bettany also does very good. Bettany plays Charles, John's college roommate that quickly becomes his lifelong friend. This character was a perfect comic relief for the dark tone of the film. Jennifer Connelly as Alicea, John's wife, is great too. All of the acting is really great, and holds this movie up.The last great thing I'll talk about is the score. James Horner makes yet another amazing score that pulls you inside of John's head every time it plays. It really helps the audience see through his eyes, and understand the way he feels about certain subjects.Now, the only negative I had with film is the plot progression. Some people can see this film as very boring for the first act, yet also unpredictable. I thought the movie was going to go one way, until it took a 360 about halfway through and really threw me off. I actually had to sit and process it a little before continuing on with the film. This a good thing, once the credits role, but for the first portion of the movie, and when the twist occurs, it makes you wondering whether or not the film should've played out this way.Overall, A Beautiful Mind is a great film, and a must see for most people. Ron Howard does amazing again, especially with Russell Crowe, Paul Bettany, Jennifer Connelly, and James Horner working with him to create his best film since Apollo 13. A Beautiful Mind gets an A-, or a 9 out of 10.",9,0,1,20 February 2016
The Departed," One of the Best Films of the 00's.
","The Departed is directed by the one and only Martin Scorsese, and stars Leonardo Dicaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone, and Alec Baldwin. Huge star cast. It's plot is very interesting, as it's about an undercover cop, and a rat in the police office, that try to figure out who each other is. The rat is fathered by a drug lord (Jack Nicholson) and the undercover cop is somewhat mentored by the police chief (Martin Sheen). As you already should know, Martin Scorsese is one of the best directors of all time. He's directed Goodfellas, Casino, The Wolf of Wall Street (also with Dicaprio), and Taxi Driver. Another thing you should know is that this film won best picture in 2006.To start, the acting is truly amazing. Some of my favorite actors are in this film, but even the actors that aren't mentioned above do really well. Dicaprio does so well as Billy Costigan, I forgot I was watching a movie at a couple points. Matt Damon also does truly amazing in his role, along with everyone else. The directing is also great. Martin Scorsese continues to amaze me, even with the great films he had done before this movie was released. Some of the camera angles he decided to provide are interestingly risky, but work really well.There was also a scene in this movie that surprised more than I've been surprised in a movie in a long time. It is a spoiler, so I won't tell what happens, but prepare yourself. That's all I'll say.Another good thing about the film is the cinematography. Some of the shots of Boston are amazing, especially from a recurring rooftop that we see a few times in the film. The sound quality is spot on, the Blu Ray looks great, even the no-name actors in this film do well. Everything about this movie is truly great. However, like all films, this movie does have a problem. More like a plot hole, but I'll call it a problem, to be fair to other movies.It's problem begins with the smarts of Jack Nicholson's character, Castello. Castello is a smart guy. He's a drug lord that always gets what he wants. However, he can't figure out who the undercover cop is, even though all signs point to Dicaprio's character, Billy Costigan. Castello is portrayed as very smart, which he is, yet he struggles to read signs leading to Billy. That was my only problem with the film.Overall, this film is great. I recommend it to anyone who can handle cursing and extreme violence. I think this movie deserves an A+, or 10 out of 10 stars.",10,1,3,11 February 2016
The Secret Life of Pets," A Cute Kids Film With an Over Abundance of Characters
","The Secret Life of Pets is directed by Yarrow Cheney and Chris Renaud and stars the voices of Louis C.K., Eric Stonestreet, Kevin Hart, Jenny Slate, and Albert Brooks. The story follows Max, a dog who loves his owner, Katie. They both get along very well, and live in a small apartment in New York City. However, Katie goes away every day (most likely to work), and Max has no idea where she goes. During this time of day, Max and all of his animal friends get together and have parties, or just have casual conversations. When Katie returns home with another dog named Duke, Max gets jealous, and his envy sends both him and Duke on a journey that gets them lost in the big city that they live in.I wasn't too excited for this movie. The trailers looked decent, yes, but Illumination's last movie was Minions (2015), and we all know how great that was. Most of the voice actors working in this film are pretty good, so that was enough to drag me to the theater. I walked away just slightly surprised. The film doesn't bring anything new to the table, but it wasn't horrendous. I enjoyed some aspects of it, and didn't find myself wanting to leave the theater.First and foremost; this movie directly, step by step, rips of the 1995 Pixar film, Toy Story. Nearly everything that happens in this movie happened in Toy Story, and even some elements of Toy Story 2, the 1999 sequel. At first I didn't really notice it, but once time went on, I started to realize it more and more. Each and every scene borrows something from Toy Story, and it really becomes noticeable after quite a while.The best thing I can say about The Secret Life of Pets is the main characters. Despite there being way too many characters in the movie, the ones that were the most important were good. I liked Max and Duke, and their characters arcs throughout the film. I started out liking Snowball, the bunny voiced by Kevin Hart, however, as time went on, the character just started to get annoying. My favorite character was Gidget, the small white dog voiced by Jenny Slate. Her personality was very likable, and she was a very compelling character. Her friendship with Max, and her desire to rescue him really pushed the story along, and I enjoyed her character very much.On the topic of characters, there was way too many. Max and Duke are the characters that the film really centered around, but the amount of supporting characters was just ridiculous. There were a few characters that were given more attention, like Gidget, and Snowball, but Tiberius, Chloe, Pops, Buddy, Mel, Tattoo, and Viper weren't, and that's just a short list compared to to rest of the characters. Many different characters could've been cut out of the film, and that probably would've improved it.Most of the unnecessary characters are thrown in for attempts at slapstick comedy, and it doesn't always work. After awhile, the slapstick starts to get a bit annoying, and the movie really should just focus a bit more on the story. The attempts at humor throughout start to give the film a Tom and Jerry feel, as if you're just there to see small animals beat each other up with miscellaneous items or methods. The slapstick starts to get old pretty fast, and drags the film down by a lot actually.Overall, kids will like The Secret Life of Pets, and adults will think it's a cute kids movie. I wouldn't pay much to see it ever again, if I ever did. It's a step by step rip off of Toy Story, except with animals, and I wouldn't pay more than matinée price if I were to see it.",6,1,4,13 July 2016
Finding Dory," A Slight Let Down, But Good As A Whole
","Finding Dory is directed by Andrew Stanton and Angus MacLane and is Pixar's latest sequel, following up to 2003's Finding Nemo. In this film, Dory begins to envision flashbacks of her childhood, including her parents and activities she would do with them. She remembers where she used to live, and, along with Marlin (Albert Brooks) and his son Nemo (Hayden Rolence), swim across the ocean once again to find her long lost family.After 13 years of waiting, I was pretty pumped for Finding Dory, despite the underwhelming trailers. However, from the trailers, there were a few things to look forward to, such as the, once again, amazing voice acting, bright, vivid animation, and intriguing quest to find Dory's parents. Although I enjoyed the film, I couldn't help leaving the theater somewhat disappointed. There were more than a few elements that I felt could've been done better, despite the film being good as a whole.The best thing about Finding Dory has got to be the voice acting, specifically the lines delivered by the voice of Dory herself - Ellen DeGeneres. If anyone were to ask me what I would consider as a perfect blend between voice actor and character, I wouldn't hesitate to give them my answer, that being Ellen DeGeneres as Dory, from both Finding Nemo (2003) and Finding Dory (2016). DeGeneres brings a hilariousness, as well as a sincerity, to the character of Dory, completely bringing this character to life.Most of the other voice acting was pretty great too. Albert Brooks reprises his role of Marlin, the clown fish, and Hayden Rolence has taken over as Nemo on behalf of Alexander Gould, whose voice has changed since his turn as the character in '03. The film introduces a few new characters as well, such as Destiny, the near- sighted whale, voiced by Kaitlin Olson, and the beluga whale named Bailey, who can't echolocate due to a past injury, voiced by Ty Burrell. However, my favorite of all the supporting characters was that of the octopus escapee named Hank, voiced by Ed O'Neill, whose hidden care for Dory and her ultimate goals was expressed greatly through his brilliant character arc throughout the entire run time of the film.The animation - need I say - is produced by Pixar, therefore it looks incredible. Each and every fish (that matters) pops out on the screen exactly as the animators want them to. Each time the audience is supposed to see something important, we see it, thanks to the fantastic animation team working on Finding Dory. All of the colors magnificently stand out from the overall bland backgrounds, and make the film look astounding.My main complaint with the film is the pacing of timed events. Every once in awhile, the film finds itself standing still for a good few minutes, before it begins to pick up again. These stuck-in-the-mud moments are usually supposed to be emotional ones, which, I oddly didn't connect with too much, which is strange to say about a Pixar film (without 'Cars' in the title, at least). The pacing wasn't the greatest, and seemed to drag the film down a bit, which was disappointing.Another problem I found in Finding Dory was the elements it took from its predecessor, that being Finding Nemo (2003). Much like the 2010 film Toy Story 3, many elements depend on the nostalgia of the viewer. Being a child when Finding Nemo came out, I should've been struck with nostalgia when watching Finding Dory. However, I decided to take off my nostalgia goggles for this one, and was surprised by how much the film relies on the nostalgia of the audience. Although it isn't a huge issue, the similarities between this plot and Finding Nemo's stood out quite a bit.The last complaint I have with the film, which is a small one, is the lack of characters from the first film showing up in this one. We get to see a bit of Crush (Andrew Stanton) and his son Squirt (Bennett Dammann), Mr. Ray (Bob Peterson), and a glimpse of Gill (Willem Dafoe) and his friends, but no other original characters show up in Finding Dory. Personally, I would've liked to see Bruce and his shark friends, more of Gill, and even a bit more of Crush; his appearance was more of a cameo. The film spent too much time developing a multitude of new characters that it forgot to include the older ones, it seems.Overall, I did enjoy Finding Dory, it just wasn't as good as Finding Nemo, which is one of Pixar's best. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the first film, because you will appreciate it.",7,9,25,18 June 2016
Iron Man," One of the Best Superhero Origin Stories Ever Put To Film
","Iron Man is directed by Jon Favreau and stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, a wealthy business man that's somewhat cocky and arrogant. On a business trip to Afghanistan, he is captured by terrorists and forced to build a giant metal suit in order to escape. However, once he's back to safety, he is inspired to do a little more with his smarts than to just build weapons that kill and destroy, so he builds another suit; this one more technologically advanced that the other, subsequently becoming Iron Man.To start, this film was the first movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it really started it off with a bang. Iron Man is one of the greatest origin stories of all time, and one of the best superhero movies ever created. The way that Jon Favreau put all of these characters to life is very impressive, and will never be forgotten.There are very few casting choices through cinematic history that are absolutely perfect, and Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark is one of them. Tom Cruise was considered for the role of Stark, and if he would've gotten it, Iron Man wouldn't be the same. Robert Downey Jr. brings Tony Stark to life in a way that didn't seem possible prior to this film. Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts was also a really good casting choice. Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane was also a pretty good choice. The only casting problem I found with the movie is Terrence Howard as James 'Rhodey' Rhodes. Although Terrence Howard is a pretty good actor, he just doesn't fit this role. Luckily, Marvel also realized this and cast Don Cheadle as Rhodey once the second film rolled around.The directing is also very good, showing very odd yet clean looking camera angles, especially during action. All of the action scenes are directed very well, without too many cuts and many clean, long takes. The cinematography also shows itself off very well. Each wide shot, especially of Afghanistan, captures the scene very well, and advances the film.The special effects are also very good, showing off almost no obvious CG. All of the fights between Iron Man and tanks, or Iron Man and Iron Monger are great. Some of the shots, however, during a fight between Iron Man and a couple of jets, look a bit obvious in the CGI area. This doesn't hold the film back too much, but it keeps it from being perfect.Overall, Iron Man is most likely one of the best superhero stories put to film, thanks to its great cast, directing, and special effects. I'm going to give Iron Man an A-, or a 9 out of 10.",9,0,1,6 March 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Why All The Hate? It's Not That Bad
","Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice is directed by Zack Snyder and stars Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill as Batman and Superman. This movie mostly follows Bruce Wayne as he begins to feel uneasy about Superman, and what he may be capable of when it comes to the existence of the human race. Bruce feels that if this 'alien' wanted to, he could wipe out the Earth's population, and nobody could stop him. Due to this disagreement between the two, they end up in physical quarrel that could level monuments...literally.Now, since this film hit theaters, I have heard nothing good about it, besides the praise around Ben Affleck's Batman. Although Ben Affleck does extremely well, I feel that Batman V Superman is actually a very good film, and a fun superhero movie. Like said earlier, everybody has been praising Affleck's Batman, and for such good reason. Ben Affleck plays one of the, if not the, best live action Batmans we have ever seen. Everything Affleck does in his portrayal as the caped crusader is fantastic, and he plays this character near perfectly. However great the performance, I do have a complaint with the character.Now, anyone who has seen a former Batman movie, read the comics, or watched any of the animated series' then you know that Batman has a single rule when it comes to crime fighting...he doesn't kill. Not in Dawn of Justice. This dude just mows people down. He uses machine guns, grenade launchers, you name it. He kills people left and right, and it doesn't exactly do the legendary character justice; no pun intended. It does add affect to the character himself, but it doesn't stay true to the comics like it should. As a casual movie goer, it won't do harm, but as a comic book fan, it's a bit hard to swallow, in seeing the abrupt change in Batman's moral code.Henry Cavill's performance as Superman didn't really change since Man of Steel (2013); he's fine. He doesn't do bad, but he definitely isn't Christopher Reeve. I personally like him better as Clark Kent than I do as Superman, but, like I said, he doesn't do bad. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman was a really good casting choice. Although she doesn't have the biggest part in the film, she does pretty good. As far as the character goes, she seemed to just pop up randomly throughout the film, as if the filmmakers tried to keep her character bobbing above water, that way she didn't sink under, but she didn't exactly stay afloat either, if that analogy makes any sense.Now, Amy Adams does good as Lois Lane, and I still stand by that casting choice. However, when it comes to Lois' actual character, it doesn't work. Throughout the entire film, Lois is on a wild goose chase, trying to figure out some dirty deed that Lex Luthor may or may not have had a hand in (more on him in a minute). Once her mindless subplot is finally over with, she gets involved with the final fight, and basically becomes a damsel in distress. It's at this point in which I realized that the filmmakers really just didn't know what to do with her character. They had her go on some unwarranted quest, just to occupy her character in one way or another. This upset me, because this whole factor took away from the film majorly.A big controversial topic about Dawn of Justice is Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He's been getting a lot of hate recently, and I can see why. He's a bit over the top, and crazy at times, and I really can understand why this doesn't work for some people. However, this was not the case for my personal experience. I really enjoyed Eisenberg as Lex, despite him being nothing like Lex Luthor from the comic books. This didn't bother me, however, because he actually isn't Lex Luthor, he's Lex Luthor Jr. He's the original Lex's son, and that's why he's so different from Lex in the comics, so it works for me. I like the wackyness to him, even though it's a little over the top at specific moments.The action in this film is absolutely amazing. Every moment of the battle between Batman and Superman is gut wrenchingly exciting. All of the directing was also top notch. Many people know Zack Snyder for his style over substance, and that applies to Batman V Superman. Although the script is lacking a lot, the direction and action look beautiful, as true with most Snyder films.Doomsday. Just like everybody speculated, he looks stupid. He looks like a Michael Bay ninja turtle mixed with the character of Abomination from The Incredible Hulk (2008). He also causes too much destruction in the city, and basically cancels out what this film tried to make up for with the destruction caused in Man of Steel (2013). His battle with the three heroes doesn't work out too much, considering he was created to 'kill Superman.' I say this because he also tries to kill Batman and Wonder Woman as well, which doesn't make too much sense.The last topic I'll hit is really hard to discuss. All I'll say is that the film made a very ballsy choice towards the end of the movie, but then repeals the decision. It's hard to say without spoilers, but once you see the movie you'll know what I mean. The ballsy decision should have either stayed in effect up until the end, or not have happened at all. If either of this two outcomes would have been, the ending would have been better by a whole lot.In conclusion, Batman V Superman isn't a bad film, and was very fun to watch on the big screen.",7,3,6,26 March 2016
The Ringer," Contained Some Good Laughs, But Was Pretty Bad Overall
","The Ringer is directed by Barry W. Blaustein and is the story of a man named Stevie who, when his friend Stavvi loses some fingers, is pressured by his gambling uncle to enter the Special Olympics as a mentally slow man in order to earn a lot of money. After wrongly entering the Special Olympics, Stevie poses as a man named Jeffie, and runs across multiple conflicts throughout his time at the event. That's pretty much the entire movie.I was actually expecting a complete pile of trash prior to watching The Ringer, but it wasn't completely awful. It had some good comedy throughout parts, and most of the acting was decent. Although The Ringer had some poor direction and a lazy script, it wasn't fully horrible. It had some good aspects.The best thing for The Ringer was the acting. Johnny Knoxville was pretty good, as both of his characters. He technically was acting as a guy who was acting as another guy, which is somewhat confusing, but he played both Stevie and Jeffie pretty well. Brian Cox, who played Stevie's uncle, was the highlight of this movie for me, due to his good acting. He played a gambling man who was in deep with the wrong people, so he bet on Stevie winning the Special Olympics, and did it well. All of the other acting was fine. Nobody else did great, but there wasn't any bad acting either.Some of the comedy was pulled off decently well. Although the film was making fun of mentally challenged people, it was supported by the actual Special Olympics, so I guess nobody can really defend them. A few lines that were written for laughs didn't receive any, and some of the jokes were pretty stale. However, a few lines did have me laughing, and laughing hard. Not all of the comedy is bad, just some of it.The worst thing I found in The Ringer was the direction. It wasn't completely awful, but it was horribly bland and boring. Most of the time, I felt as if I were watching a cheap Lifetime movie, and I shouldn't have felt that way. Most of the shots were very boring, and the direction didn't do anything good for the film at all.The script was also quite lazy. For example, a specific person's opinion on a subject will change from scene to scene, even though the subject may be a bit touchy. The script quickly brushed over these types of scenarios, and it felt very lazy and rushed. Most of the dialogue was somewhat clichÃ©, and a lot of it was surprisingly flat. Not many lines had me asking questions, or even wanting to see more of the film. That's not a good thing.Overall, The Ringer wasn't awful, but it most definitely wasn't good. Although it did contain some good acting and some funny comedy, those couldn't save The Ringer from a bad script and poor direction.",5,1,1,8 May 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Best Star Wars Since Return of the Jedi
","I had the amazing opportunity of seeing this the day it premiered in theaters (December 18, 2015). After waiting over a year and 4 hours in line, I was ready to see this movie. When I sat down and the movie began, I silently said a prayer that it wouldn't be another Phantom Menace. And boy it blew me away. I would say in the blink of an eye that this was the best Star Wars since Return of the Jedi. Every moment of this movie had me on the edge of my seat. It was utterly amazing, and I watched this movie like it was prey. I am not exaggerating at all. Of course it had problems, otherwise it would receive a 10. It's main issue was (as I'm sure you've heard) is the similarities with episode IV. However, I address this by saying that fans wanted movies to be more like the originals, not the prequels. Now that it is like the originals, people are complaining. It's near impossible to please some people. However, the one aspect I thought was very weak was the Starkiller base. As a character says in the movie (no spoilers), it's basically another Death Star, and we've already seen two of those. Other than that, this movie was practically flawless. It definitely deserves a 9.5 or so (or an A) and I suggest anybody see this movie.",9,5,48,26 January 2016
The Matrix," A Revolution For The Action Genre
","The Matrix is directed by the Wachowski Brothers and stars Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Hugo Weaving, and Carrie-Anne Moss. The basic plot of the movie is a computer hacker named Thomas Anderson, whose code name is Neo, finds out that everything he believes about his reality is a lie, and that he must learn to fight a certain force in order to ensure the survival of humanity. That's all I can say without spoiling the entire film.The Matrix is one of the most revolutionary films of all time, especially in terms of the action genre. There's no explaining just how amazing The Matrix is, without just recommending it to a person who has never before seen it. Everything that can be said about The Matrix has already been said, and I'm just going to say it again.The absolute best thing about The Matrix is the indescribable direction. Rarely are there films in which they look better almost 20 years after they come out, then when they first hit theaters, yet The Matrix is one of them. Even movies that used very little special effects, like Star Wars (1977) still have little points that look a bit fake. Not The Matrix. Every single shot of Keanu Reeves dodging bullets, or Laurence Fishburne doing a back flip and kicking Hugo Weaving in the face looks inexpressibly beautiful. Nothing since this movie, not even its two sequels, have come even close to the directing capabilities, no matter how hard they've tried.Another great thing The Matrix offers is the incredible acting. Even Keanu Reeves, who is considered one of the best worst actors of all time, does really good. He isn't Keanu Reeves in this movie, he's Neo, and he knows it. Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus is one of the most iconic characters of all time, and does great all throughout the film, whether it's an exposition scene or one of the many amazing action sequences. I don't even need to say that Hugo Weaving did near perfect, because, well, it's Hugo Weaving. And he does near perfect. Carrie- Anne Moss plays a great Trinity, to the point in which I couldn't see any other actress playing her character at all, and that's saying something.The special effects. Wow, the special effects. The Matrix contains some of the best special effects ever put to film, ever. As mentioned earlier, many other films have tried to copy The Matrix's directing style, and none have even come close to it, even its two pretty disappointing sequels. The Matrix's special effects are utterly perfect, and there's no doubt about it. Every single scene has flawless special effects, and blends them in incredibly, leaving not a single trace of doubt in them.The script for The Matrix is also as good as it gets. Although there is the symbolic 'woah' from Keanu Reeves, every single line fits into the film perfectly. The Matrix has one of the few scripts that I would have no complaints with. Not even one. Not too often does a script describe action scenes, like this one does. I implore you to read the script for The Matrix, and just see how in depth The Wachowski's went into the action scenes. Reading the script feels almost like reading a full length book due to the extent that the writers went to in order to achieve this masterpiece.In conclusion, The Matrix is one of the best action films of all time, and might just be one of the best movies of all time. Thanks to its revolutionary directing, perfect script, and near flawless acting, I'd recommend The Matrix to anyone, as long as you avoid its two sequels.",10,1,3,10 April 2016
Godzilla," Better Than Expected
","Walking into Godzilla, I expected crap. I literally expected to hate the movie, like the last Godzilla movie. However, I was very pleasantly surprised to see that it was pretty good. Of course it has problems, but they are pretty easily outweighed by the positives. First off, many people will complain about the lack of Godzilla himself in the film. Yes, I wanted him to have a bit more screen time, but the absence was not too obvious. Second, (spoiler alert) Bryan Cranston's character dies. He was by far the most interesting character in the whole film, yet he dies 30 minutes or so into the movie. I'm fine with him dying, it really draws emotion out of his son, played by Aaron-Taylor Johnson, but he dies so early in the film, it washes out both of their characters. This also leads me into the third and biggest problem. I truly didn't care about any (besides Bryan Cranston) of the characters at all. I actually was waiting for one of them to die so we would actually care somewhat the next time watching it, but it didn't happen. This really threw me off on how I felt about the movie. After seeing it, I went home and thought about it a lot. I really did enjoy it overall, but these problems really weigh it down. The CGI was absolutely amazing, with breathtaking shots of Godzilla fighting the Muto, and I really enjoyed the cinematography. Overall, I think Godzilla should get a B+, or an 8 out of 10.",8,1,4,26 January 2016
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," One of the Most Iconic, and Best, Films Ever Made
","Star Wars is directed by George Lucas and is the story of a young man named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) that lives on the desert planet of Tatooine with his Uncle and Aunt. As he reaches his late teenage years, he begins wanting to leave the planet and live his own life, away from the desolate wasteland of a planet. However, as soon as he begins to become passionate about leaving, he meets an old hermit named Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness), that tells Luke that he knew his father, who was a Jedi Knight, before the Empire had taken over. This information leads Luke on an adventure, pitting himself against the Empire and the dark side of a mysterious energy called The Force.Near everyone knows the impact that Star Wars had on the film industry. After the massive hit that Star Wars was, filmmaking had changed forever, and for the good. George Lucas had simply revolutionized a new era of film, bringing to life many sequels, and prequels, and an entire new generation of filmmakers and fans. Not only is Star Wars legendary, it's amazing as well. A film can be remembered, and not that great, but Star Wars is, simply put, fantastic.The best thing about Star Wars, if there is one, is the groundbreaking special effects. Even now, almost 40 years later, the special effects don't look fake. All of them look completely believable and great at the same time. This is mostly due to George Lucas' use of models. Rather than making everything out of CGI (cough, prequels), Lucas used small models of the Death Star, the Tie Fighters, The Millennium Falcon, etc. He filmed these models shot for shot, and it payed off, due to just how great the effects look all this time later.Not a single soul can talk about Star Wars without mentioning its score. As most know, John Williams composed the music for Star Wars, and did a fantastic job with it. The iconic opening theme is one of the most memorable songs ever composed, both for a film, and of all time. Near everyone can remember the tune of the song, and it's heard everywhere. In fact, I heard the opening theme being whistled by a worker in my local grocery store a couple days ago. The memorableness of this score is incredible, and deserves all of the praise that it gets.The acting is also great. Mark Hamill does a great job as Luke, and plays the character like nobody else could. Harrison Ford is literally perfect at playing Han Solo, and brought to life one of the coolest movie characters of all time. Princess Leia, played by Carrie Fisher, is a great character, and is portrayed very well by Fisher. Alec Guinness is absolutely amazing as Ben Kenobi, and so is the actors that portrayed C-3PO and R2D2, Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker. All of the actors in Star Wars are very talented, and did great in their roles.Also, the script, written by George Lucas, is astounding. Before this movie was made, none of the cast or crew expected it to do well, especially with the outlandish script. However, nobody could even imagine the vastness that is the Star Wars universe today. The script propelled this film in every way possible, and is the biggest reason, aside from the special effects, that Star Wars was such a success.The last thing about Star Wars that I'll mention is the villain, Darth Vader. Not only is Darth Vader the most iconic movie villain of all time, he's the best as well. Without knowing anything about his past yet, Darth Vader is still a very compelling and fantastic villain. He's menacing, intimidating, and likable all at the same time. Darth Vader is perfectly acted, both physically and in voice (credit: Peter Cushing and James Earl Jones). He's the perfect villain, and did so much for the Star Wars franchise.Overall, Star Wars is easily one of the most iconic films ever made, and, in my opinion, one of the best. Anyone and everyone should watch Star Wars; it's highly likely that you'll enjoy it.",10,1,1,29 April 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," One of the Most Enthrawling Action Movies of Recent Years
","Kingsman: The Secret Service is directed by Matthew Vaughn and stars Taron Egerton as young Eggsy, a teenage street kid that is recruited by a spy organization, and must compete with other recruits in his class in order to become the next Kingsman, a gentleman like spy. Upon being recruited, he befriends an older Kingsman named Galahad, played by Colin Firth, that teaches him the ways of being a Kingsman, and, more importantly, being a gentleman.I actually didn't want to see this movie. I've never been too hot on espionage films, and wasn't looking forward to Kingsman. However, this movie proved me wrong in so many ways. I had an absolute blast watching Kingsman, and so regret not seeing it the theaters. Near everything about this film entertained me, and I was on the edge of my seat through every single action sequence. Kingsman was one of the few movies of recent years in which I had white knuckles through every single action scene, and even most of the talking scenes. Kingsman was an amazing movie, and had great aspects about it.The best thing about Kingsman is the actors' portrayals of the characters. Prior to watching this movie, I doubted Colin Firth as an action hero, but he was fantastic as this gentleman spy. I read that he did 80% of his own stunts, and it really paid off. Taron Egerton was the highlight of this film. He displayed Eggsy's large character arc near perfectly, and delivered every single one of his lines believably. Samuel L. Jackson played a great villain, and was another great attribute that Kingsman had going for it. He pulled off the 'evil plan' cliché, while also acknowledging that it was a cliché.The direction by Matthew Vaughn was amazing as well. The way he manipulated the camera to film at varying speeds while weaving in between characters, mid fight, during the action sequences was excellent. He brought every scene to life so vibrantly that Kingsman sucks the audience in after watching it for only 5 minutes. All of the direction was great, and brought the film to new levels of expertise very quickly.The score was the third thing that really pulled me into the scenes, particularly the suspenseful ones. Without going into too much detail, the parachute scene was one of the most suspenseful scenes I've seen in recent years, and the music had a great part in it. All of the music throughout the entirety of Kingsman was astounding, and sucked me into the film so easily that I felt like I was there, in the film, rather than watching it.The only problem I had with Kingsman was the ending. Not particularly how the film ended, but some subplots that weren't wrapped up like I had hoped they would've been. This is most likely due to the presence of a looming sequel (Kingsman: The Golden Circle coming in 2017), but I still would've preferred some closure with certain characters and stories that the film presented. Besides that, however, I loved Kingsman.Overall, Kingsman: The Secret Service was a great movie, and I'd recommend it to anyone that enjoys action, espionage, or just good movies all around.",9,4,7,23 April 2016
Joy," Contains Rough Parts, But All Around Pretty Good
","Joy is directed by David O. Russell (Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle) and stars Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro, and Bradley Cooper. It's the true story of a girl who had a pretty rough life. Nothing had ever worked out for her, even on the day she dropped and broke a glass of wine on a priceless boat deck. As she's mopping up the mess, when she rings the mop out, she cuts her hands on the glass. She is then struck by the idea to create a self wringing mop, and this is the story of how she does so. To start, Jennifer Lawrence, as always, does amazing in her role. She's done great in every role she's been in, from Katniss Everdeen to Mystique. Another good role in this movie is Joy's father, played by Robert De Niro. Anyone who has ever seen a movie with De Niro in it, you know he's great. He is considered one of the best actors of all time. So, of course, he does great in the film as well. He was actually the funniest character in the whole movie. The last good casting choice is Bradley Cooper. Bradley Cooper is the next big thing nowadays. He's done good in films such as American Hustle, Silver Linings Playbook (also with Jennifer Lawrence), and American Sniper. He also does good in this movie, given his character is pretty bland and boring.Now, the plot does sound far-fetched, and it is. But, it works out well. The film has funny dialogue, and good plot progression. There is one scene towards the middle in which Jennifer Lawrence gives some amazing lines, and does an amazing job with her character. However, there are some parts where the movie doesn't work, such as the ending (no spoilers), but it works out relatively well for the rest of the plot. The biggest problem in the whole film is the characters. Although De Niro and Cooper do well in their roles, I never cared about their characters. I only cared about Joy's character throughout the whole movie, and that's not something you should want for your audience. I wanted to care about their characters, yeah, but I just didn't. If the characters would've been more rounded, or interesting, than this movie would be receiving a lot of better reviews from anyone and everyone. So, despite its rough ending, and stale characters, I still thought Joy was a pretty decent movie. I would give Joy a B, or a 7 out of 10.",7,0,4,6 February 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," One of the Best Action Films of All Time
","Mad Max: Fury Road is directed by George Miller, the director of the original Mad Max trilogy, and stars Tom Hardy as Max Rockatansky and Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa. This movie hit theaters on May 15, 2015, and I made the stupid decision of waiting until February 2 of 2016 until I saw it, after renting it from Redbox. I really regret not seeing it in theaters. This was definitely one of the best movies of 2015.To start, Fury Road was beautiful. The cinematography was absolutely amazing, especially combined with the amazing wide shots that George Miller used throughout most of the movie, to capture all of the action, while still focusing on our heroes. The second great thing is the acting. Tom Hardy definitely lived up to Gibson's Max, however didn't exceed it, which interested me. He did as good, yet Gibson is still Max. Charlize Theron also did really good, which surprised me, because I've never seen her in a role like this before.Another thing great about this movie is the action factor. This movie lives up, or even exceeds action movie legends such as Predator, The Matrix, or The Dark Knight. Although there are breathing points, the action is nonstop, edge of your seat material. I truly feel that this movie will later be compared to movies such as T2 or Die Hard.Although I've done nothing but praise it, there is one bad trait about this movie. It's substance. I would say this film's equal to The Road Warrior, but not better. The reason being is the substance. Although Fury Road has much better and more action than The Road Warrior, you don't get the relationships in it. Yes, Max befriends Furiosa, and you can feel their friendship their, but it isn't much when compared to the relationship between Max and The Gyro Captain from The Road Warrior.Out of the best picture nominations for this year, I hope either Fury Road, The Martian, or The Revenant wins. These three movies are all great, and I'd be fine if any of them won the award they all really deserve.Despite it's one problem, Fury Road is a near flawless movie, and I would give it an A+ or a 10 out of 10.",10,3,10,4 February 2016
13 Hours," Gives the Truth to the Audience and Lets Us Gather Our Own Opinions
","13 Hours is directed by Michael Bay and stars John Krasinski, James Badge Dale, Pablo Schreiber, David Denman, and Dominic Fumusa. The story follows a terrorist attack enacted upon an American embassy in Libya, called Benghazi. When Ambassador Chris Stevens and his security were under attack, all soldiers were told to stand down. However, a handful of men went to lend aid, despite what their superiors told them.To get it out of the way, this film barely touches the political issues behind the film's story, and that was a good move. What 13 Hours does is takes the exact truth of what happened in the terrorist attack, and sets it on the audience's lap, leaving them to form their own opinions upon the topic. This aspect of the film adds a layer to it that isn't too politically preachy, as many feared this film would be.As far as Michael Bay movies go, 13 Hours is amazing. Not that Michael Bay is a terrible director, he just doesn't have the best filmography under his belt. However, he's created a few good films in the past, such as Transformers (just the first one), or the 1998 blockbuster, Armageddon. I don't hate the guy, because I believe that he truly tries to make quality content, he just doesn't always succeed. Despite his issues in the past, he did a really good job with 13 Hours. I enjoyed it, and appreciated almost every aspect of it.While on the topic of Mr. Bay, his direction was great. The only issue I took with the camera work was very small, and that was just the over abundance of slow motion shots throughout. All of the slow motion was done well, but it was used just a little too much. Other than that, however, I had absolutely no problems with any work that Michael Bay did on the film. The direction was perfectly fine, and it worked very well for what the film was wanting to achieve.The best thing about 13 Hours is the acting, and all of the talented actors working on the project. In specific, John Krasinski delivers one of his best performances to date, leading the film brilliantly. All other actors do good as well. Although I wouldn't use the word 'outshine,' I feel that John Krasinski does stand out a bit next to his co-stars, due to his higher level of acting, despite the other actors doing well in their roles.On the flip side, the worst thing about the film is the suspense, or, rather, the lack thereof. Throughout the entire film, our main protagonists are under near constant attack, yet I barely ever felt any tension in their situation. I never truly got attached to any of the characters, and thus I never feared for their lives. Although the story, and the real men who tragically gave their lives, is very sad, I never felt any tension or fear almost at all, and that pulled the film down a lot.Like mentioned above, I never truly cared for the film's characters, and I'm basing that critically on the characters in the film, not the real men. This was completely the fault of the script, because of its inability to make me feel for the characters in the film. Although I feel that Chuck Hogan did a good job with the script, he didn't make me, as the viewer, care too much for the characters, which isn't a good thing to say about a writer.Overall, I did enjoy 13 Hours, and I wouldn't mind seeing it again, I just wouldn't pay much for that chance. I'd recommend 13 Hours to anyone who likes action or war films, or is regularly involved in anything politics.",7,2,5,11 August 2016
Cinderella Man," Follows the 'Boxing Movie' Cliché, But Still A Good Filim
","Cinderella Man is directed by Ron Howard and stars Russell Crowe as James Braddock, a rags to riches boxer that tries to make a life during the Great Depression. The story follows Braddock, and his wife (Renee Zellweger) as he rises from a very bad boxer, to a very good boxer, and the conflicts that this causes in his marriage, and the ever so hard time known as the Depression.Ron Howard, the director, is known by many people as Opie Taylor. However, he is also a pretty good, and well known, director in Hollywood. He's directed such movies as The Da Vinci Code, A Beautiful Mind (also with Russell Crowe), and even Apollo 13. He's done some pretty good films, and this one lives up to the others. While on the topic of Ron Howard, I might as well mention the directing. The directing in this movie is actually pretty good. During the fight scenes, he films the action pretty well. There aren't an overabundance of cuts, and he used a lot of wide shots when Braddock was in the ring. I was impressed with the directing.The cinematography was also pretty good. Some people may not like it, because it's dark and dreary, but I liked that quite a bit. It expresses how hard the Depression was, and it symbolizes the people's' lives. Their lives were dark, and nothing seemed to work out. This is also true for the story's protagonist, which leads me into my next positive.The characters were very likable. I truly understood why James had to fight, and I also understood why his wife, Mae, didn't want him to. She needed him to be able to take care of the family, and he thought he was doing so by fighting. He saw fighting as a way to make money, and she saw it as an easy way to get killed. These characters are a literary device known as a foil; they contrast each other. However, this somewhat reflected on another couple involved with the boxing business, and for those of you who have seen the Rocky films, you know exactly what I'm talking about. James and Mae are a pretty clear image of Rocky and Adrian, which could easily bring the movie down, if not set in such a specific time period as the Depression was.Speaking of the Rocky films, James' final opponent, Max Baer, reminded me of Ivan Drago, from Rocky IV. Both men were known for killing opponents in the ring, and being very strong, yet the protagonist still insists on fighting them. The last two points could easily be summarized by the 'boxing movie' cliché. This cliché is abundant through all boxing films, not just this one. It is easily recognizable in other movies, such as The Fighter, Raging Bull, or Southpaw. This, however, can be excused by the difficulty to differentiate themselves from other boxing films.So, overall, my main problem with the film is it's obvious cliché, yet I liked almost everything else about the movie. I think Cinderella Man should receive a B, or an 8 out of 10.",8,1,1,15 February 2016
The Martian," Accurate Nomination For Best Picture
","The Martian is directed by Ridley Scott and stars Matt Damon as Mark Watney, the astronaut that accidentally is stranded by his team on Mars. The story follows Mark as he struggles to survive on the barren planet, and his crew as they try to rescue him. Now, Ridley Scott has made some good films, such as Gladiator, Alien, and Blade Runner. Now he's made another one. The Martian is easily one of the best films of 2015, up there with The Revenant and Fury Road. Whether or not it deserves best picture is another topic, but I'll get to that soon.To start, the directing is very good. Ridley Scott always takes nice, wide takes of action, or just to show the epicness of this movie; epic meaning grand scale. That also leads to the cinematography being good. Although Mars is a barren, desert planet, the cinematography somehow makes it look beautiful, especially in far off shots of the vehicle or the base.The acting is also very good. Other than Matt Damon, there are a lot of other good actors in this movie. Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Kate Mara, Michael Pena, and Sean Bean are also in this film, and they do really well. Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain have pretty good on screen chemistry, and their conversations and banter really work for the movie.Another great thing about the film is how hard the movie beats down Mark Watney. Every time he has things going his way, something happens to knock him back down, and the audience really begins to feel bad for him. This is common throughout all 'stranded' films, such as Cast Away, Gravity, or 127 Hours. However, being on a completely different planet - and one humans haven't visited yet - really adds to the theme of the film, which is how a man would handle a situation such as this when all he has is his wit and his will.The above paragraph actually leads me into my main negative, which is storytelling. Throughout every film, the audience has to figure out what's currently going on, or 'what's the plan.' In a good movie, they learn from things occurring, but this film straight up tells you. Every time Watney is making little videos recapping the Martian day, or 'Sol,' he tells the audience up front what's happening. We don't have to figure it out, he just lets us know. This is my biggest problem with the film, which disappointed me due to how great the rest of the film was.Overall, the Martian is a great movie with very few problems. I think The Martian deserves an A-, or a 9 out of 10.",9,1,4,16 February 2016
