Raiders of the Lost Ark," The way all movies should be!
","When I first saw Raiders I knew nothing about it - I went purely on sighting the movie poster, not expecting too much.  From that very first scene, where the Paramount 'mountain' cleverly changes into a real mountain, I realised this was going to be something special.The almost relentless action is beautifully balanced with just enough quiet moments, and there's plenty of humour so you know not to take things too seriously.  Best of all the story line is great.There are a few plot holes - like how did Indy get inside the submarine without being noticed?  But these minor infringements can easily be overlooked in what is on the whole a cinematic masterpiece.I guess I've seen Raiders upwards of 20 times now, and could easily watch it that many more.  I have introduced my daughters to it, & they love it almost as much as I do.  I think this is one of those timeless movies - certainly it plays on many that have gone before it, but that's part of the charm. Long live Indy!",10,0,0,21 October 2001
Billy Elliot," The type of 'feel-good' movie the Brits do so well
","I really enjoyed Billy Elliot.  It gave a very nice depiction of one boy's efforts to rise above the drudgery and pessimism of strike-torn life in the English coal mines.  It would have been very easy for the black side of the film to drag it down, but there is enough comic relief to balance this.Main criticisms - the storyline was a bit predictable, and some of the dialogue was almost incomprehensible.  Being a Kiwi I'm probably more used to English accents than most Americans, and I have lived in England for two years - but there were still some whole conversations where I couldn't catch a word!  Perhaps taking realism a tad too far for the mass-market...On the whole though a very enjoyable, well-acted film.",7,0,0,26 October 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Surprise - it really IS good
","My first thought after coming out of the cinema was: 'this is the first super-hyped film I've ever seen that didn't disappoint me'.In fact, it was even better than I had hoped.  Yes, I have read the books (2 or 3 times) but I'm not a 'MiddleEarth freak', so I was quite happy with the licence taken with the story in places.  It was going to be inevitable that some plot and character devices would be required in transferring an epic of these proportions to the screen, and I was entirely comfortable with the compromises Peter Jackson made. And it sure didn't feel like 3 hours' viewing (a slight let-down in fact, as the time whizzed by so fast I almost felt I hadn't got my money's worth!)Coming from New Zealand, where the whole film was shot, I was obviously very keen on the 'scenic' aspect of FOTR, and it didn't disappoint - although I confess I didn't actually recognise a single location!Perhaps what surprised me most was the overall quality of the acting; without exception the cast (and casting) was admirable.  I thought Viggo Mortensen played a very good Aragorn, and Frodo was much better than I had hoped.  I could go on about the top notch special effects, fantastic sets etc, but you've all heard it before.  Suffice to say, superb.This isn't to say, of course, the film was entirely without fault.  I found the score a bit overly (& obviously) dramatic in places. And, while I realise the time constraints, I felt there wasn't enough introduction or explanation of some of the Fellowship - particularly Gimli and Boromir.  and just how DID Gandalf get his staff back?These are minor quibbles though, and (apart from the music)not something I really noticed until I thought about it afterwards.  Overall, I give FOTR my highest recommendation",10,0,0,23 December 2001
The Fast and the Furious," A REALLY enjoyable B-grader
","TF&TF is a really dumb, B-grade film - and I thoroughly enjoyed it!It's one of those films where you need to shove you brain in neutral and overlook the less-than-Oscar standard script, ho-hum acting and plot holes big enough to drop three Honda Civics in.  Take it as a pure adrenaline rush though and it's great.  This brought back memories of the original Gone in 60 Seconds from way back in the 70's.  Lots of squealing tyres, jumping, bumping cars and not much else.  Cool!",6,0,1,26 October 2001
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," This film has everything!
","I knew this was going to be unlike any other film right from the first scene.  There's a view of starry space, and a space ship slowly glides into view.  Then it gets bigger, and bigger, and bigger...and I realised this was a film on a different scale to anything I had seen before.It's true - there's more action, more hammed-up acting, more special effects, and a great new take on the ol' good versus evil story.  Let's face it, Star Wars is basically a fairy tale - it just has more than its fair share of butt-ugly characters in it.I guess the proof of any movie is how it stands the test of time; with its 20th anniversary re-release it proved just as entertaining as when it first hit the screens.  This is truly a classic movie",9,0,0,31 October 2001
