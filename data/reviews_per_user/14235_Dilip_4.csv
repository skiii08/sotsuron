Saturday Night Fever," Crass, 'uninspiring' plot - I am sorry I tainted my memory of this music with any association with this film
","I was in high school during the 'Saturday Night Fever' era and, I thought surprisingly, I had never seen the film.  In late December, perhaps on a reminiscent whim to hear some high school popular music, I rented the film and now don't feel surprised I didn't see it when it came out - it is not a film with any degree of innocence or timidity.I was very disappointed at the crass violence (especially when Tony, played by John Travolta, leads his friends to literally crash into a bar to beat up the folks there), crude language, demeaning sexuality, racism, and lawless behavior of Tony and his gang. To me, the boorish characters juxtaposed ironically and very negatively vis-a-vis many of the songs whose lyrics were in fact positive and innocent.The crass and insipid plot argue for a rating of perhaps 1 out of 10. However, the dancing is good and the songs bring back memories to me of good high school times. Overall, I give this film a 2 or 3 out of 10, but I can't think of anybody I'd recommend to see this film.",3,4,12,10 January 2000
Elf," Fun light-hearted film with a good soundtrack that all ages should enjoy
","I saw this film a few days before Christmas 2003 when it was in the theatres. I took two children, a boy aged 9 and a girl almost 10, as well as another adult.  We all loved it!Buddy (Will Ferrell) as a baby in an orphanage accidentally ends up in the North Pole when he climbs into the bag of Santa (Ed Asner) to play with a teddy bear. Once Buddy is found, Santa and the elves decide to raise him as an elf and Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) becomes his father. Clearly something is wrong when Buddy towers over his peers and just doesn't have the innate toy-making and other abilities that the elves do.  He's told that he is actually a human being, and his real father, Walter (James Caan) works in Manhattan - and is on Santa's 'naughty' list.The story of Buddy's returning to Manhattan is a delight for children and adults alike.  Bob Newhart brings his typical understated comedy to the role of Papa Elf that he made popular in TV shows from the 1960s through 1990s, such as 'The Bob Newhart Show'.  Santa doesn't play a major part in this film, but Ed Asner was 'the man' to bring to life a reasonably jolly but bit 'fluster-able' character.Buddy's enthusiasm and sappy sweet optimism is filled out with remarkable scenes of his speed and agility in working with Christmas decorations and snowballs, as well as a delightful relationship he builds with the lovely Jovie (Zooey Deschanel).  I loved the music, especially the duet of Zooey and Leon Redbone in 'Baby, It's Cold Outside', as well as Ella Fitzgerald's 'Sleigh Ride' and Eartha Kitt's 'Santa Baby'.  And the scenes with Santa's sleigh were exciting to see!This is a fun and relaxing film for all ages to get into a holiday mood or just to smile anytime of the year.  Young children should particularly enjoy the costumes and Buddy's antics, and I would think that all but the most jaded would find 'Elf' to be a light-hearted and fun film with a good, retro soundtrack.  Jingle bells!   --Dilip, Christmas 2003",Null,0,2,26 December 2003
"Monsters, Inc."," Perhaps Pixar's best film; technically excellent animation, great color and music, and fun story!
","'Monsters, Inc.' was a thoroughly entertaining, fun, and exciting film!  I loved Pixar's animation, of course, and the story was funny and interesting. There is a scene in the first two or three minutes of a monster's scaring a sleeping child (actually, a simulation at the Monster utility company), and a second scaring simulation 2/3 or so through the movie which some children as old as 6 or 7 may be disturbed by, but otherwise the film is great for all ages!The ingenious plot takes place at a utility company in Monstropolis, a world of monsters.  In 8-hour shifts, the citizen monsters go through bedroom doors of sleeping children; the screams that the monsters evoke are the energy currency of Monstropolis.  But even as they scare the children, the monsters themselves are afraid of humans.  What happens when a child accidentally enters an ajar door and comes into the world of the monsters?I found that I enjoyed this film even more than Pixar's earlier 'Toy Story' or 'Toy Story 2' (both also excellent films!).  'Monsters, Inc.' is one of those few films that I left the theatre feeling that I would like to see the film again soon while it is still playing on the big screen.  I found the plot and animated characters (especially the main character monsters, Sulley and his sidekick Mike, and the so cute 4-year-old Boo - perhaps misnamed as she was, in fact, rather brave) to be captivating, the colors and music contributing to a fun 'retro modern' style.  The humor could be appreciated by all ages, and I enjoyed catching a brief reference to 'Toy Story', when Boo picks up a toy featured in that movie.  I loved the chase scene through the seemingly endless doors, and the scene with the Abominable Snowman, who was trying to be helpful (sno-cones, anybody?!).This film is certainly worth seeing again on the large screen and then owning when it is out on video.  The animation is rich; careful repeat watchings will no doubt reveal additional interesting detail, such as reading of all of the headlines in the scene where Boo is discovered in Monstropolis.Don't miss seeing 'Monsters, Inc.' while it's playing in theatres, so you can enjoy the rich colors and animation.  What a fun treat after the tragedy of September 11!  I rate is 9 or 10 out of 10!",9,0,1,25 November 2001
Amélie," Lovely fairy tale of a film - one of the most fun, zany, captivating, charming, and magical movies I've seen!
","'Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain', or simply 'Amélie' as it's known here in the States, is one of the most fun, zany, captivating, charming, and magical movies I've seen.  I saw it 'cold', not knowing anything about it, on a flight home from London in late July 2002, and liked it so much that I plan to see it on the big screen and also to buy it as my first DVD!The film takes place in Paris and, though the folks speak with French accents, the dialogue in the American version is in English. A breathless narrator explains in a matter-of-fact style how Amélie (Audrey Tautou) is born into a family where the only physical contact she gets is from her father's monitoring her heartbeat; how her Mother dies in a freak suicide that unwittingly kills the unsuspecting Mother as well; the backgrounds of eccentric characters; and narrates on and off as necessary.Amélie is a quiet and lovable character from the moment we see her as a child.  Her childhood is covered quickly and the film is mainly set in Paris with Amélie in her, I suppose, 20s, working as a waitress.  Her innocent charm, those oh-so-large eyes, the curious characters, and her desire to anonymously help others (and the webs she weaves to accomplish this) all make for a delighful film.Don't miss this fairy tale of a film!  It has something for everybody - intriguing plot with an underlying quirky humor, fascinating characters, good soundtrack, and a heartwarming story. I'm surprised the film garnered an 'R' rating; I can't see what would be offensive in the least even for a teenager or pre-teen (except possibly one well-done scene where the rhythms of a couple's sexual union are aurally evidenced in the cafe).  I would give it a 9.5 or 9.6 out of 10!",10,0,1,3 August 2002
