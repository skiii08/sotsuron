Mission: Impossible III," Tom Cruise's Best
","I just saw the movie on Saturday night and my heart was still beating 30 minutes later.. I know Cruise has been through a lot lately but nothing showed for this movie maybe the best movie i have seen in my 14 years.... Having Luther in the movie really helped and just the storyline and plot leaves you guessing until the very end.... Definitely the best MI off the 3 and hopefully the gang will come back together for a 4th one to make this one of the best series since Lethal Weapon.All I can say is wow and this is a must see,,,, don't wait for DVD to come out go see it today!!!!!Boilerup09",10,0,2,7 May 2006
