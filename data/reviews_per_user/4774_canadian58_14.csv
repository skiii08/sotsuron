50 First Dates," In a word...Excellent!
","I'm not usually into romantic comedies, yet this one decided to work its way into my top favorite movies. I am a big fan of Sandler. His movies seem to be getting better as time goes on. 50 First Dates is about a man who falls in love with a woman whose brain damage causes her to forget him every night, and therefore he must make her fall in love with him each and every day. Despite its tragic plot, the comedic elements make the mood light and fun. The story fits together perfectly, the characters are great, and the ending is not quite what you would expect. It pulled at my heartstrings several times, as it will yours. It's one of the better movies out there. See it. 10/10",10,1,1,18 December 2016
Ted," I wish all movies were as good as this!
","I saw Ted expecting a raunchy, crude, mean-spirited black comedy. Yes it can be raunchy and crude at times, but this movie couldn't be further from mean-spirited. This movie, although adult-oriented and not child friendly (to say the least), is actually big-hearted, and uplifting. It tells the story of a man whose best friend is a talking teddy bear named Ted. But since he is 35 years old now, his relationship with Ted is interfering with his relationship with his girlfriend. It's laugh-out-loud funny (I can't remember the last time a movie made me laugh this much) and yet still is able to tell a great story of love and friendship. It's too bad this couldn't have been dialed back a bit to appeal to a younger crowd, but that probably would have taken something away from this gem of a movie. Highly recommended. 10/10",9,2,9,28 May 2013
Superbad," A teen party movie full of wit and heart.
","Most all teen party movies follow a trend- booze, sex, nudity, no plot, pathetic attempt at humor. Superbad is the exception. Given its premise, this movie is witty, hilarious, and even touching at times.Three high school seniors trying to get alcohol for an underage drinking party so they can hook up with the girls they like. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera make the perfect best-friend pair, Seth and Evan, as they are about to graduate and go off to different colleges. This party is their last chance to score with their crushes. Fogell is their only hope for getting booze, as he has a fake ID in which he is named McLovin, a 25-year-old from Hawaii. Of course, everything that can go wrong does.I'm not much for these teen party movies, as they are all the same, unfunny, gross, a waste of time. I caught Superbad on TV, and I'm glad because I wouldn't have picked it up otherwise. It is full of sexual dialouge, f-bombs, and drawings of penises, but to my surprise the sex was very minimal. No nudity, but it's not needed, unlike most other movies in this category which need lots of boobs just to get people to watch them. Superbad stands on its own with clever humor, great acting, and a wonderful story of friendship. 9/10",10,0,3,27 March 2013
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Very good
","Let me start by saying that I love the X-Men series. However, i have not nor do I intend to read the comics. Comics aren't my thing, so I'm reviewing this strictly as a film fan, not a comic fan. I don't understand why this movie has a bad rap. It's got a good story, good acting, and great action sequences. It tells the backstory of Logan/Wolverine and his evil brother Victor, before Logan became part of the X-Men. This movie isn't perfect. But it's far better than X3, which has some pretty major flaws, but is good nonetheless. It's a close second to X2 and First Class, which to me are the best two in the series. I have not yet seen Days of Future Past so I can't compare it to that. This movie is worth a view, it's entertaining and fun, and Hugh Jackman is great as Wolverine, they couldn't have picked anyone better to play him. Liev Schreiber is also very good in this, as Logan's half-brother and nemesis, Victor. 9/10 stars",9,2,4,17 August 2014
Silent Hill," Strange...but good
","Silent Hill is one oddball movie. That said, it's creepy, suspenseful, horrific at times, and all in all, enjoyable. It's very slow paced, but that's OK, as it keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for what will happen next. The final scene is very bloody and awesome. You just want to see that religious bitch get it from the first moment she's on screen, and boy when she does, it's well worth the wait.I have played the video game, but didn't complete it, as I got stuck in a loop and couldn't get out of it, and got extremely frustrated. That's why I didn't see the movie right away, I was kind of annoyed with Silent Hill.This is typically not my type of movie. Yes, I like horror flicks, but this is so far-fetched and unrealistic that normally I would steer clear. But I just so happened to watch this one, and it was not bad at all. Worth a view. 7/10",7,0,0,22 June 2014
Alien," What is all the hype about?
","Despite all the good reviews of Alien, in my opinion it is no better than any other low-budget, let's-run-through-dark-tunnels being-chased-by-a-monster-that-we-never-see movie. This movie is not terrible by any means, but it's also not as good as everyone says. It's one of those that is built on suspense and suspense only, and if you scare really easy, then I guess you'd really like it. I've seen a hundred movies more suspenseful than this. The 'heartbeat' rhythm that plays throughout the film adds to the suspense, but not much. Not once did I gasp, jump, or even sit close to the edge of my seat. I watched this movie ten years ago, and forgot the entire thing. Very forgettable story, empty characters, only about ten minutes of the film do you get to even see the alien. I have not seen any of the sequels, perhaps they are better. I don't plan to find out. How is this film rated so high? I guess because it's considered a classic, the outer space version of Jaws, which by the way is no better. My rating, 5/10.",5,3,11,11 October 2014
Hugo," Fantastic movie...if you're not a kid.
","Hugo is dubbed as a family/kids movie, but after seeing it, I believe any child watching it would find it boring and uninteresting. This is a two hour movie, which is a long time to hold any youngster's attention, and Hugo is very slow-paced, dramatic, and adult-themed in my mind. Although appropriate for children, I believe the adults will be the ones getting the entertainment out of Hugo.That being said, Hugo is a wonderful movie. Heartfelt, inspiring, and uplifting, not to mention visually stunning. It tells the story of Hugo, a boy who is orphaned when his father dies, and ends up living in the walls of a train station and trying to repair a mechanical man that his father left behind in hopes of getting a message from him. He meets Isabelle and her godparents, and finds out there's more to them than meets the eye.This is the first time I've seen Sacha Baron Cohen in a movie that is not raunchy and crude like Borat and The Dictator. He is sort of the comic relief of this movie, but his acting is very good as the station inspector. As always, Chloe Moretz is perfect in her role as Isabelle, and I must say that her accent was very convincing. Asa Butterfield does an OK job as Hugo, but doesn't stand out as excellent.Overall, a movie with wonderful visual effects, and a very inspiring story. Kid friendly? Not really. There are a few parts that kids would like, but mostly adult-oriented. Also, I believe they could have cut this down to about 90 minutes and gotten about the same result. It does get a little tiresome.",8,2,3,7 September 2013
Bad Teacher," Bad Movie
","Lame, unfunny, and boring. What a waste of time and money. One of the worst movies of all time. Need I say more?This movie centers around a woman who gets dumped by her rich boyfriend and is forced to go back to teaching. She then manipulates, lies, and steals to raise money for a boob job, in hopes of attracting a new rich man to mooch off of.I like Cameron Diaz as an actress. After seeing this garbage, my opinion of her is now lower. How could she agree to play the part of such a horrible person? Normally, a movie's plot centers around the hero, and does its best to get you to hate the villain. Bad Teacher is exactly opposite, trying to get you to like the villain (Diaz) and hate on the people trying to stop her and her criminal ways. This doesn't work anyway, you immediately hate Diaz right from the beginning, and are shaking your head and cussing her all the way through.Now, I might be more forgiving had the writers tried to change her from a bad guy to a good guy. There was one small failed attempt at this. Otherwise, bad guy all the way through, and in the end, she gets away with everything! What a disappointment. And not once while watching this 'comedy' did I so much as chuckle.",1,12,21,11 August 2013
Jurassic World," Visually stunning, action packed fun! Lacks depth, characters, and plot.
","Jurassic Park is one of my all-time favorite films. The Lost World and JP3 were good follow- ups, but nowhere near the quality of the original. Yes, I said Jurassic Park 3 was good, all you haters out there. It was not a great movie, but short, fun, and to the point. It did not deserve all the hate that it got. The fourth entry in the series ties the second and third movies, in my opinion. Better in certain aspects, worse in others. It is a fun-filled action romp, but lacks depth, character development, and plot. It far surpasses any of the first three films in terms of visual effects, as it should, I mean we are in 2015, not 1993. That, and the fact this movie cost twice as much to make as any of the others. The plot is stupid, to say the least. If you can call it a plot. A theme park is reopened after the disaster 20 years before, with the same results, just worse, with a much higher death toll. Villain Hoskins wants to use tamed raptors for the military. Workaholic hero Claire doesn't spend enough time with her family. Raptor tamer Owen is the only one who sees the storm coming when Claire announces the new hybrid dinosaur, Indominus Rex. Oh yeah, and Owen and Claire have a love-affair-sort-of thing going on. Claire's two nephews are visiting the park, and are upset about their parents divorcing, which by the way we never find anything out about in the end. That being said, this is great fun to watch. Dinosaurs stomping around causing mayhem and destruction while enjoying chasing and feasting on the 20,000 plus park visitors. The final showdown between the Indominus, the raptors and the T-rex is EPIC! I'm sure since this movie broke records already in its first week at the box office, there will be more sequels to follow. Which is fine. I'll just go into them expecting nothing more than a typical Hollywood film- carnage and mayhem, overtaking plot and characters.",9,9,23,18 June 2015
Sausage Party," Has some monstrous laughs...but for the most part falls flat
","Over the top is putting it lightly. Sausage Party is nothing but crude, vulgar, gross, and mostly unfunny. Granted, there are a few clever elements that are extremely funny (Gum as Stephen Hawking), but for the most part it's a senseless sex comedy that tries really hard but ultimately falls flat. The plot is ridiculous, humans being evil gods for eating (or rather 'killing' the food), and they can enter the 4th dimension and understand and interact with the food when they get high on bath salts. The main character Frank the sausage wants to find out the truth about what actually happens when food leaves the grocery store. Is it paradise, or will they die? The other villain besides humans is the douchebag. LOL. I tried to enjoy it, I really did, but I was just sitting there asking myself WHY? What is the film trying to achieve? I get that the different foods represent different cultures and ethnic groups. So what? The climax is nothing but a fight against the humans in the grocery store. How dare the humans eat (kill) food? This is a movie, yes. Completely implausible, yes. Pointless? Absoutely. It would have been way better as a 30 minute short. Could have gotten the same message across and I wouldn't have gotten as bored.",5,0,2,4 March 2018
Back to the Future Part II," Almost a 10, but has a large plot hole
","Back to the Future is a fantastic series, however this sequel has a gaping plot hole. There would be no need to travel into the future to stop Marty's son from committing a crime. They could simply wait until it happens over the natural course of time, and address it before it happens. This is always bothered me when watching this film. It takes something away from it. However there's so many good parts it's still well worth watching. Don't think I'm writing a negative review because I'm not. I just wish their reason for traveling to the Future was a little more believable.",9,1,2,24 December 2017
Godzilla," In a word...EPIC!
","I wasn't going to review this film, however, after reading mostly negative reviews, I felt I needed to put in my two cents worth. I am definitely in the minority on this one. I loved this film. It captured my attention instantly and held it for the entire two hours. Sure, the plot is familiar, but anyone who expects a new plot for one of the oldest, most famous monsters ever, is nothing but kidding themselves. This is a new version of some of the old 'Godzilla vs.....' movies. Not similar to the 1998 film in which one monster stomps around and destroys the city. Sure, that also happens here, but not without an epic battle between Godzilla and other radioactive monsters. Yes, most reviewers are complaining that Godzilla only appears for 10 minutes in the movie. This is true, as the other monsters have more screen time, but most of the film is built on suspense, and in my opinion it works very well. There is still plenty of chaos and destruction for the action buffs. The human story (about Ford Brody and his family) is quite weak and almost non-existent. But that does not take anything away from this epic monster movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it, it is VERY entertaining. 10/10",10,123,194,14 November 2014
Warm Bodies," Wonderful new twist on the zombie genre
","First off, Warm Bodies is a wonderful movie. Well made, great acting, great scenery, hilarious dialogue, and a lot of heart. Second, it introduces a new concept into the zombie genre: What if by interacting with humans, corpses could somehow turn back human?This is the story of R, a young zombie who meets a human girl and feels the need to protect her. The more time they spend together, R develops more emotions, thoughts, dreams, and ability to speak.I highly recommend this movie. I'd be going out on a limb, but I'd say this is the best zombie movie I have seen. Sure, I enjoy the traditional zombie stuff. But as all other zombie movies follow the same trend, this is a nice change of pace.I was skeptical of the PG-13 rating, but less blood and gore does not take anything away from this movie. It's perfect the way it is. 10/10",10,0,0,5 November 2013
The Island," An excellent movie with a familiar plot
","Having just watched 'The Island' for the first time, I have to say it is one of the most entertaining movies I have seen in a long time. I found the plot to be very similar to Arnold Schwarzenegger's 'The 6th Day,' although 'Island' far surpasses its mediocre twin. A cloning company that sells 'insurance policies' to rich people (the Sponsors) to add 70 years onto their life has human clones believing there was a worldwide contamination that rendered the world uninhabitable, and their only hope of happiness is winning the 'Lottery' and leaving the containment area to go live in peace on the Island, which doesn't actually exist, in reality, they are taken to be killed, and their organs removed to be used when their Sponsors need surgery.This movie captured my attention instantly and didn't let go until the end credits rolled. Unlike many movies of its kind, the plot was not terribly complicated, and I followed it easily. Great action sequences, particularly the chase scene where Lincoln rolls the giant iron reels off the semi and takes out the entire force chasing them. Ewan McGregor is good in his role, and I always enjoy seeing Steve Buscemi. I've always been a fan of Scarlett Johannsen, and she really shines in this role.Check out this movie, it is quite lengthy, but it's well worth your time. 10/10",10,3,5,8 June 2014
