The Longest Yard," If anyone liked this movie, I'll bet 10 to 1 they NEVER saw the original!
","THE LONGEST YARD: The fact that I barely remember the original (seen it once in the theatre in the 70's), and the fact I wanted to rent it again, and give you a proper comparison theatre report, is one of the main reasons I'm late. Anyways the movie starts off in the right foot and follows a formula (like most movies these days), but as time wears on race & homosexuality tend to way heavy, veering further away from the original, and how many gay jokes do you need in a prison flick? (this ain't Will & Grace do Alcatraz!). The addition of Burt Reynolds was purely cosmetic as he did little to offer the story, its a shame as he was in his element in the original. Sandler can barely fit in Reynolds shoes and leans heavily on comedy verses story. Chris Rock as the caretaker seemed funnier than Sandler, still the racial conflicts are weak in the 2000's verses the same situations of the 70's. The actual game seems weak in comparison too, from what I can remember in the original, the game was exciting and you rooted for the underdogs (much like in M*A*S*H), this game I couldn't wait for it to end, much less care who won. I also heard Eddie Albert (original Warden) died a day before this movie was released, just giving him enough time to try out his rolls in his new coffin. So like most remakes I have to ask why bother? Write something original for a change Hollywood, PLEASE!!!!",3,1,3,12 June 2005
Cinderella Man," PLEASE support this movie!
","Cinderella MAN. An actual original historical movie, with academy award winners Russel Crowe, Renee Zellwinger, and director Ron Howard. What could go wrong? Other than its slow initial pace of this movie, it eventually catches up when he gets fighting again (so be patient!), its quite an excellent movie. So why the poor box office? I think earlier or later in the year would have fared better financially as its not a typical summer blockbuster (like was Star Wars 3 and Madagascar that it was up against). Still it has the legs and is still not out in the count (excuse the pun), although Russell Crowe (who played fighter Jimmy Braddock) may feel the disappointment, which might have prompted him to throw a phone at a hotel staff worker on opening weekend. Still history will look favorably on this movie and earn some academy award nominations to boot (so far this year there's very little to compete against it). I also think Howard could have traded some earlier drama and continued right till the end of Braddocks career and his final fight against Joe Louis. Which was considered his best test of bravery, even Joe Louis agrees he never fought a tougher fighter, although Braddock would lose in the 7th, (maybe Cinderella man 2 is in the works? Oh never mind). Still that is my only criticism, as this movie will stand the test of time verses the the fickle and dull box office. Please go watch and support this movie, maybe Hollywood will get the message and create more movies like this, instead of crappy 'formula (cookie cutter) type' movies we are being subjected to!",9,1,2,12 June 2005
