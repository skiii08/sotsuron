Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Lessons Of NH, ESB, Neglected For ROTJ
","I realize I'm in the minority, but I hated this movie.  Lucas had twenty years to write the script and this is the best he could do?This movie doesn't feel right.  The climax of Independence Day is exciting, the actors, music, etc. suggesting this is for all the marbles. Even in the climax for PM, I never got that 'Here we go!' feeling.Like in ROTJ and NH Special Edition, there is an abundance of slapstick gags totally at odds with a story about intergalactic civil war.  The characters do not behave realistically.  Why would the robot soldiers tell each other orders?  Wouldn't they communicate with each other in binary, like a modem?  And if I see one more movie where the plan to capture the bad guy involves the heroes travelling 'a secret underground passage' that no one else knows of, I'm going to be sick.Also, the light saber battles threw me.  Yes, they looked cool, and I liked how Darth Maul used the Force to open a door without letting down his guard.  But the fights are styled like martial arts swordfights, not the classic fencing from NH, ESB, and ROTJ.  It's inconsistent.On the bright side, the special effects are sweet, the pod race being genuinely thrilling.  The long shots of the architecture are amazing, like something Rand and Robyn Miller would dream up.  John William's music isn't workmanlike this time, it actually invokes the scenes.It all comes down to how much detail you pay to Star Wars.  Casual viewers will love its eye candy.  True fans who sensed a disturbance in the Force with the Ewoks in ROTJ know what they are in for.",Null,0,1,22 May 1999
10 Things I Hate About You," Avoids usual cliches, hits the right notes
","Okay, this is like 'Taming Of The Shrew' with the cast of 'Daria'.  But unlike 'Daria', every character has a brain and flaws that make them overrule it at times.  The humor is sharp, sarcastic, and hilarious (the scene where the father explains, 'I'm down, I've got the 411,' is one of my favorites).  It also has a lot of heart as it avoids most cliches and treats the characters realistically.  A simple kiss is not what it takes to convince others of true emotions.  Admittedly, having the father more concerned about pregnancy than, say, 'AIDS,' makes it a little tough to swallow, but his concern is genuine, as it Kat's.  There's a lot of energy, and it was good to hear Madness playing again, even if it was a song from the early 80's.  Unlike most movies with romance as the lynchpin, you believe in these characters, root for things to work, and wonder what will happen next when they don't.  Easily worth full price, but see it early. There'll be fewer noisy teenagers in the audience (trust me, I speak from experience).",Null,0,1,8 May 1999
BASEketball," A little bumpy, but runs solid
","The only problem with BASEketball is it tries to mix in the standard 'We will overcome our temptations and tribulations' plot that dots so many other movies.  The exposition is actually the slowest part of the movie. Fortunately, that aspect is so by the numbers, only minimal time is spent advancing the story, figuring the audience can fill in the rest.  That frees up more screen time for the hilarious gags.  The psyche-outs by the Beers are hilarious, and the constant riffs on the faux purity of modern sports will draw anyone in.  The sport actually celebrates poor sportsmanship.  The cheerleaders don't lead cheers, but act as open-air coochie girls.  The team from Dallas, recalling the extracurricular trouble players get into, is called the Fellons.  One sports mogul is rich enough to pay Kareem Abdul-Jabar to sit in a glass case on private display.  If modern sports depresses you, and you want something hip, aware, and funny, get it and you won't be disappointed.",Null,0,1,28 February 1999
There's Something About Mary," One viewing is enough
","This is a Farrelly Brothers movie, which means, like 'Dumb And Dumber' and 'Kingpin,' there is shock humor galore.  The problem is that it means you can really only watch the movie once.  Once you know what's coming, the Farrelly Brothers lack the ability to keep you laughing with timing or technique.  It's all about how far out the humor goes.  After abusing the dog or the opening bit about 'The frank or the beans,' you'll be laughing the first time you see it.  After that, you'll know what's coming, and you'll feel the boredom start to set in.  It does get points for the romantic heart beating beneath it, but this isn't exactly a date movie.  Be careful who you see it with.",Null,0,0,28 February 1999
