The Avengers," Averangers
","Meh.In this movie there's everything you expect, just as you expect it: extremely noisy action scenes, a multimillionaire budget flaunted without restraint, superhero brawls, New York invaded by aliens for the 2.735.961th time and the usual Stan Lee cameo.I suppose that's enough to satisfy Marvel zombies.To me, it seems like Mr. Whedon worked alternating the autopilot with the Copy & Paste function. For example, the showdown against Loki's army is basically Transformers 3 final battle with different characters, and a less talented direction.The only real surprises come from humor: I have to admit that comic reliefs are effectively funny. Apart from this, you'll find nothing but cheesy costumes, woody and/or pointless dialogues, tons of derivative spectacularity and a plot that often seems to go nowhere (Black Widow, with all that chatting aimlessly about her past, is particularly confusing).And Thor's hammer is blatantly fake.",5,25,86,26 April 2012
Gravity," An underrated masterpiece
","I'ts hard to believe, at least for me, but a lot of user reviews seem to describe Gravity as
1) a visually stunning movie, and that's all, or
2) a simply bad one.
Don't misunderstand me, it is a visually stunning movie: but that's just the surface. Gravity is a movie about grieving process. It's a story about a woman who, physically and figuratively lost in a cold and hostile universe, has to deal with her inner demons and learns to let go and forgive herself. Notice that the movie is split in two by a scene showing her naked and cowering in fetal position: that's a rebirthing.
In my opinion, Gravity is one of the most touching, well-written and original pieces of cinematography of the XXI century.",10,3,4,9 September 2018
