The Avengers," Little slow start but a truly awesome 2nd half...
","This,one of the most awaited movies of 2012 did not disappoint me even a bit...a truly remarkable movie and hats off to Mr.Joss Whedon for such a great direction... Even though the movie had little slow start,a superb acceleration to excitement and action that followed takes away all the credit.... The best part of it was ,even though its an action movie,a great addition of humor and funny moments intelligently added at perfect timings was added entertainment which really did not let me get bored even for a second... I would say its one of the most watchable action movie ever made and also kudos to Mr.Robert Downey Jr.for awesome acting and comedy timings..!!",9,2,7,3 May 2012
