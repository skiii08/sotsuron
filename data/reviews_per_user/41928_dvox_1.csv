The Blair Witch Project," 'The walrus was Paul....'
","Ingenious marketing gimmickry a la the Beatles' bizarre plot to dupe dumb fans (planting hundreds of subliminal clues and back-masking material) into believing Paul McCartney had died.  'The Blair Witch Project' employs similar salesmanship via the lost documentary crudeness and subsequent staging of an implicit massacre which will undoubtedly result in a 'War of the Worlds' fever wherein fans staunchly believe its validity.  Art imitating life imitating death? Just remember the words of the old song 'The Teddy Bear's Picnic':  'If you go out in the woods today...' Finally, a genuine scare for the first time in eons!",3,0,2,20 June 1999
