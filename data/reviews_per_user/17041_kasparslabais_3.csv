Blade Runner 2049," Let's pretend first blade runner did not exist
","I will try to be short and not include any spoilers. To be absolutely fair with you (who ever is reading this) I don't think first blade runner really is so good as it's rating shows. With that I mean, that movie wasn't bad, but for futuristic environment and plot, the story moved a little bit too slow or even let's say not as you would want. I guess movie was solid 7, definitely something what you could watch even now...but then comes this 'sequel'. I say 'sequel' because I think 'Blade runner 2049' would be great movie without attachment of old movie, maybe it would get some plot holes or hype, but it is solid piece at is is. I would recommend this movie to anyone, because it maybe hard to explain, but movie has something that make you want to keep it watching, to follow lead character and just enjoy time. It is really solid movie and I would say it is better than original. Technical side is solid as well, maybe will fill a little bit similar to 'Ghost in shell' , but that movie has great scenes too.Overall , Ryan Gosling gives great performance, Ana De Armas is just something amazing to watch and Harrison Ford is much better as Decker than in original (despite on screen time).",9,1,7,18 October 2017
BlacKkKlansman," Can I put bad review and not be labeled as racist?
","NO SPOILERS! But seriously can I put bad review and not be labeled as racist? FIRST! I did like acting power from most of the cast (really good job), it was filmed in appealing style, and it had its funny moments. So why 5 stars? 1. Biggest reason is how this movie was adverted. I went to cinema with absolute different vibe and expectations and because of that I could not enjoy movie right after 15-20 min when I felt it isn't what it tried to sell me. 
2. Movie did not bring anything new to the table. It has solid (really good) acting, but it seemed like I'm watching cut-scenes from different movies and put together.
3. It has bad mix between comedy and serious parts. Maybe jokes are too rare or to plain, but it makes you struggle to understand what was directors intentions? 
4. End scenes (this is kinda spoiler, so will not say what was in it) felt really biased and ruined last bits of movie, because it felt too much out of place. It made me feel like all what trailers wanted is me to spend my money and see end scenes of directors views.I don't mind more political movies, but I felt tricked and movie itself wasn't that good. I don't want to spoil movie, so I would have more to say, but then it goes in discussion of certain scenes.",5,267,491,27 August 2018
Justice League," Are these people blind?
","Let's ignore all the spoilers and make this simple as possible. Movie was...bad? I was more than just disappointed , especially if day before watched Thor:Ragnorok, which wasn't perfect but a little bit better. Issues: Batman is getting worst, I mean people did not like BvS, I'm one of those who actually did like the movie, but Batman was kinda alright, I even liked his darker tones, but in this sequel (basically it is) he is..confused? It seems like he is confused how to react to people who is now around him.Team of what? I have read a comics, but even for me it would be more interesting if I would know original story of characters, in this Justice League you get new characters and have no idea who they are, what their motive? Even in comics, those characters have different original stories depending what you read...so you don't connect with them...I did not mind cgi, but story was half-baked and you can blame studio or director swap, but to be fair movie just seemed that will fail from beginning. So for me question was...how studio? or directors could not see that this would not work? I will probably re-watch movie at home some day, but it wasted potential, especially because there was really nice (simple) jokes, it was fun to watch Flash, Aquaman, Batman (to be fair they could add more those small jokes) but it wasn't enough.",6,3,10,24 November 2017
