Walk the Line," 'Great Balls of Fire' was better!
","When movies today are as bad as they are today, you get people going crazy over mediocre movies like this one! Jouquin Phoenix looks nothing like Cash, he can't sing, and Reese Witherspoon looks like a yuppie from Los Angeles more than she looks like June Carter. I can't believe this movie has received so much adulation. Was I watching a different movie? I thought that Johnny Cash and June Carter were southerners who had hard lives? The actors playing them seemed to have an air of wealth to them. This movie just didn't seem realistic in any sense whatsoever. I thought June Carter in real life was a hard woman. Reese Witherspoon seemed like a graduate student more than a low-class southerner! Anyway, don't feel like you have to follow the crowd and like things just because other people do. I thought this biographical epic was as boring as 'The Greatest Story Ever Told', and it seemed like even a longer movie!!! I thought the movie about Jerry Lee Lewis was much better, and it didn't receive any Oscar consideration whatsoever. I dare anybody to watch 'Great Balls of Fire' and compare it to 'Walk the Line', and tell me that 'Walk the Line' is better!",2,9,18,11 March 2006
