Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Not up to Par with Jackass
","I did not think this movie was up to par for its genre. The genre being a movie that broadsides people that basically have no idea they are being hoodwinked. Too much of the movie is 'fake' in the sense that the reactions of too many of the victims and the victims themselves were staged. I would estimate that maybe only 10% of the film used real victims and the rest were staged to look like real victims. That is not enough for this type of movie to be worth seeing. The yard sale scene was obviously staged since that is where he found the Pam Anderson book that is part of the ongoing plot of the movie. I believe the hotel convention scene was staged just from the cameras that were already setup inside in anticipation of their entry into the room. Also, too much of the movie was exposed on TV clips, talk shows, and newspaper write-ups.For a movie like this to work for me, you really need real victims like you had in the Jackass movie that had no clue.",3,4,11,6 November 2006
