Hereditary," re-defines slow burn
","This movie was terrible. I cannot imagine who the people are who are giving this a good review. The movie's tagline is: 'When Ellen, the matriarch of the Graham family, passes away, her daughter's family begins to unravel cryptic and increasingly terrifying secrets about their ancestry.' -- and I wanted to see that movie. The tagline is a lie. The secrets don't start to unravel until you are 90 minutes into the movie, by then you have probably fallen asleep and if not, the secrets are 'meh'.This movie would be OK as a drama about a family descending into madness induced by a series of tragedies. Shoehorning horror into this movie was awkward, and unnecessary. In the very, VERY slow opening 90 minutes there were 2 or 3 remarks that meant little at the time but made sense after the movie concluded -- but it wasn't much, and not really compelling.The first 90 minutes succeeded in making you feel uncomfortable -- with the awkward family and their misfortune, and there were a couple of senseless gore scenes which added nothing to the movie other than allowing them to call it horror. If you want to feel uncomfortable, this will do it. If you want gore, this doesn't have much, if you want jump scares, again, look elsewhere. If you want creepy -- this movie has a bit of that -- but again, it falls more into discomfort rather than truly creepy. They call the end a twist. It wasn't. It was a surprise, I suppose, but not a consequential one.Just don't watch it. Even streaming. It isn't worth your time.",3,1,4,5 November 2018
Ready Player One," This movie was NOT good.
","With the plethora of references to my childhood (and the age of the child playing the Atari 2600), it would seem the target audience is me. I loved the references to my past -- that is the reason I gave this movie four stars instead of the 2 or 3 it deserves -- it is also the only reason I did not turn it off after 30 minutes. The movie is just not good. The story is not good and the characters are not good. The presentation looks like a cut-scene from a video game -- and although they were IN a video game they still could have done better. Nothing that happens in the film is remotely believable. The 'clever' twists were not clever. The characters had no depth, typical for video game characters, but less so when there are supposed to actual people behind those avatars. They give you no reason to care about these people... I fear that if the script had tried the actors still would have failed to pull it off. I cannot believe how bad this movie was in light of the fact that I AM THE TARGET AUDIENCE. Massive disappointment. Watch it only if you want to enjoy A LOT of references to nerd-culture of the 80s (and some 70s and 90s) woven into a boring 'story'.",4,1,3,16 July 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Pretty good super hero movie
","This was a pretty good movie. It had humor, it had action, it had Robert Downey Jr. The CGI was a bit *off* in some of the swing-from- here-to-there scenes. Mostly I thought Michael Keaton did a great job. He played the part very well. Also, enough cannot be said about how they were able to take a character as lame as Vulture (seriously, is there a weaker repeat character in Spider-man's rogues gallery?) and make him ominous. The character had hat tips to the comic book character (flight suit collar looking sort of like the comic book Vulture's nonsense around his neck) without drawing too much from it -- which is a good thing, since comic book Vulture is lame. Shocker was in it... albeit in a secondary capacity. They also gave a nod to the comic book uniform for him, again without drawing too much from the on- page character.",7,1,3,16 October 2017
Suicide Squad," This movie is... OK.
","As the title says, this movie is OK. There were a couple occasions in the first 45 minutes that I considered turning it off -- but because of the hype, and because I am a sucker for comic book movies, I kept watching. It improved... some. It is mildly entertaining, so if you have nothing better to do, give it a shot.The story. The movie needed about 90 minutes more to make the story coherent, but since the story was not good anyway, I guess it is just as well that they went through it fast.The Joker. He was not in it too much. Turns out, I am OK with that. It was an attempt to show a lunatic-type Joker, but it just didn't work. Its not just Heath Ledger's shadow -- he was not great even without that looming over him. There were a couple of lines that were delivered well, but mostly it was very underwhelming.Harley Quinn. I'm not a fan in the first place, but I was not impressed.Deadshot. Will Smith was the best of a bad bunch of actors, but he certainly was average at best, himself.Killer Croc. Geez. I wanted to like this guy, but... He was hard to understand and he looked odd. I know, he's a crocodile... I don't mean that. I mean his head was massive for his body and it looked weird. Speaking of which, Batman... WTF. I HATE this costume. Same one from Batman v Superman where batman has no neck.Bommerang, or whatever his name was. Pass. This dude had WAY more lines then he needed. Totally extraneous.Climbing Guy. Who didn't see this guy with no discernible skill disappearing quick.Viola Davis -- whoever she was playing. Goodnight, that was a poor character with poor lines who was poorly acted.Weird zoom shot. So toward the end, the camera just conspicuously zooms from wide-angle to zoomed in... Its not a problem, per se, I just haven't seen it in a movie since 1981.The characters were rushed. I did not care about anyone in the movie. The story was too big to be told in the time allotted. It just did not work.",4,0,1,11 December 2016
Pacific Rim," 7? Really, 7 stars? For what?
","So it may not be fair for me to rate and review this film since I only watched about 2/3 of it, but I have a fairly good idea what the rest would have been. I gave this movie 3 stars, which I honestly feel is generous.If you like giant robots and/or giant monsters, then consider this movie. If you do not like them, then run from this movie. now. and fast. I gave this movie 3 stars and watched all the way to 2/3 point because of the giant robots and monsters, which were the only redeeming feature of the film. And there was nothing special about them, I just like seeing them on screen.The acting was bad. The story was bad. This movie was bad. It is one of the few movies I've stopped watching. Watching poorly executed scenes with poorly written and meaningless dialogue for and hour to get to see 20 minutes of robots and/or monsters was not worth it.How is there going to be a sequel to this? That is mind-boggling. I know what it will be: some giant robots fight some giant monsters. the monsters get increasingly stronger while the robots get increasingly weaker, but the robot pull it out in the end. In between all this will be rigid, unconvincing dialog being poorly executed by bad actors. Enjoy.",3,0,1,16 January 2018
Justice League," Wow. What the heck was this???
","I went in with high expectations -- figuring it would be just a step below the Avengers. It failed to live up to my expectations. First of all, Ben Affleck is a terrible batman. The worst batman ever. I highly doubt there will ever be a worse batman. Wonder Woman was decent. These other people... who are they? They show up without getting enough of a story on them -- how can we care about them? Flash, Cyborg, Aquaman... they were cardboard cutouts. Steppenwolf? Really. There was no better bad guy than this clown, who wouldn't have been impressive even if they hadn't seemingly gone out of their way to make him boring. What happened to Darkseid? That was what I was watching for. Then again, they would have messed him up, so maybe I am glad he did not show up. This is a re-skinned Suicide Squad. Characters we don't know or care about, and a less-than-one-dimensional villain. This movie tried to rip-off the Avengers formula and failed miserably. Just rent it. Or do not watch it at all, that may be better. This is probably the end of the road for this DC endeavor -- time to reboot the whole thing.",4,1,2,22 March 2018
Split," I think I will give up on this guy
","The movie wasn't bad, per se. If it was just a movie directed by Average Joe and if the bad guy wasn't superhuman it would probably have been a fine movie. This movie is highly regarded, and I know at least part of my less glowing viewpoint is my expectations.1. M. Night Shyamalan. For some reason I keep expecting amazing things from him. Partially because of The Sixth Sense, and partially because I like the topics he writes about. The Sixth Sense was amazing. I enjoyed Unbreakable a lot more than I probably should have, because of its theme. I think it probably is not nearly as good as I believe it to be. Signs. A very popular film, which made no sense. I read an interview where Shyamalan belittles the reporter for not reading between the lines with Signs, and for taking it at face value. Well, 'M', if you had written it better perhaps people wouldn't be confused about what was going on. I have not watched it again since reading the article, so it may improve my opinion of the movie -- it would almost have to. The Village. This movie was awful. dreadful. unwatchable. Please, do not watch this movie. 2. Twists. I expect twists from all his movies. This may not be fair, although apparently they all have twists, they are just often so obscure no one notices them. Apparently Signs had a twist. I will have to watch again to see if it really is. The Village had a twist, although I knew what it was after a mere 4 minutes, which made the rest of the movie hard to watch. I kept hoping I would be wrong and something interesting would be going on. But that was not the case. Split may have had two twists. 1. The main character is a 'cutter'. That's not much of a twist, and the word on the street is that wasn't the main twist. The main twist was the last scene setting up an Unbreakable/Split sequel. Twist. That's not actually a twist... that's just a thing that happened. The movies was entertaining and suspenseful. The characters were interesting. But 'The Horde's' metamorphosis is a little much to handle. And most everyone being killed was a little more sad than it needed to be. Perhaps I misunderstood what was going on, for which I expecting a condescending note from Shyamalan, but did they send the main character back to an abusive relationship with her uncle at the end? Did that really happen? Did she go from one monster to another? That is a hideous ending. Did I get that right? I hope not, but that what it seemed like.",5,8,18,18 September 2017
A Quiet Place," This movie was ok, despite everything negative I'm going to say
","First of all, I'm sure you already know, the film doesn't have a lot of talking (out loud, anyway). I knew that going in. I still found it very annoying. They used sign language which was sub-titled... But still, the lack of speech or noises in general was annoying. Then there is the fact that the movie made no sense. I know, most movies don't, but this doesn't even make sense by the rules it creates itself. There is no shortage of reviews outlining the ridiculousness of virtually everything in the movie. Despite that... I thought the movie was fine... better than average. These days that seems to be high praise (at least from me). It is absolutely watchable as long as you are not the type of person who will lose it over either of the two drawbacks I mentioned.",6,0,1,16 July 2018
Hidden Figures," Interesting movie
","This was a dramatic view of the 1960s set very much in the real world. Personally, I find that a bit dull, but since their goal was solely to tell a story that was a 'dramatic view of the 1960s set very much in the real world' they did an excellent job. It was more than a little disturbing seeing the treatment of people in the 60s. But it was realistic, probably even more tame than the 1960s reality. The story was interesting and needed to be told. I am well-versed in programming, math, science, and space -- and I had no idea. There is media attention on this topic now, but I can't help but think it is only because of this movie and not because the world finally decided to give proper credit. As an IT professional, I thought it was interesting how they showed the beginnings of NASA's IT department. I will say that if NASA really was as bumbling as the movie depicted, that is pitiful and I am shocked they got off the ground. The mainframe couldn't fit through the door and they couldn't even turn it on once they got it in place. The geniuses in the genius room were largely not and their constant changing of requirements was just begging for errors to be made. NASA has come a long way since this movie, I will say that.",7,0,3,25 September 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Seven stars, but with caveats
","As a movie, this one was pretty good. Seven stars seems fair. If you go into it wanting to see a movie, you should be pleased and I think that is what Disney was going for. Unfortunately. As a Star Wars movie, this was atrocious. Possibly worse than the Phantom Menace. As a Star Wars fan, I'd give this movie three or four stars. Nothing goes the way the previous 7 movies indicate it should. At the end you are left wondering how they can possibly make an episode IX that anyone will be interested in. They gave Rian his own trilogy for the future. At first I thought this was terrible, however, in fairness, His own Rian-Wars trilogy may be fine since it will not be expected to fit into an existing story-line.",7,1,2,21 December 2017
Super 8," A fair movie.
","This movie was entertaining. I'd say it was a little better than average. The train derailing was entertaining to watch but was WAY over-dramatic. How did the dude not die? A train crashed into him, and he is basically fine. Not sure what I think about the monster... He did monstery things, like dig holes, kidnap people, and hang them in webs -- but he is also capable of flying an interstellar spacecraft. Strange combination. I see where Strange Things got its inspiration. Also, the micro-bots from Big Hero 6. While the movie was not perfect, it was enjoyable, unlike so many of the other movies I have seen lately.",6,0,0,22 January 2018
Godzilla," disappointing
","This movie was very disappointing. I am a fan of Godzilla and will tend to give anything with Godzilla in it more leeway than it deserves, and even still, I have to say this was not a good movie. I don't know what the bug-things were, but I was hoping for a classic character to be the antagonist. Godzilla was not in the movie much, which is sad because he is the main draw. His scenes were all dark and from odd angles, making it harder to enjoy what little screen time he received. I expect this was a artistic decision, but I disagree with it. In a movie like Cloverfield it works, but in a movie named Godzilla where everyone wants to see Godzilla, it does not work as well. This movie gets 4 stars because Godzilla was in it, and I like to see Godzilla. One final point, which will likely render the rest of my review unreliable by... just about everyone. Bryan Cranston. There are people complaining that he did not get enough screen time, and they are correct, he is not the main focus. But my issue is... All I see is Malcolm's dad. I watched one season of Breaking Bad and stopped because it was so unrealistic for Malcolm's dad to be doing those things. Did no one else watch that show??? How is no one else having this problem???",4,0,0,4 December 2017
Life," very disappointed
","As the title states, I was very disappointed with this movie. I am not sure where I got the idea this movie was a blockbuster-type, but I was under that impression when I watched it. It was not a block-buster. It was not even good. It was watchable, but don't expect to be wow-ed by it. The movie was slow in the beginning. By slow, I mean boring. The pace was far too slow to maintain interest. It's like they had a notion of an idea, but no idea how to write a story around that notion. The last half of the movie was fast-paced, but full of over-used tropes, really bad decisions, and nonsensical science. Again, I am not sure what I was expecting, but this was a cookie-cutter style horror movie. No originality. The movie was predictable, even the ending. The idea of finding alien life, and the potential for that life to be hazardous to humans is an interesting topic that could make an interesting movie, but this movie is not it.",4,5,10,25 September 2017
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Pretty bad
","I wanted to wait to write a review for this until after I saw Age of Extinction because I thought perhaps my dislike of this film was based on improper expectations rather than the film itself. Well, Age of Extinction was pretty good... Dark of the Moon was not. There is a lot of action and a lot of transforming robots, so if you are just in it for that you should be fine to watch it. If you expect a decent story or to be 'pulled into' the movie, well that won't happen. Honestly this movie was dull. You don't need to see this movie to follow Age of Extinction, I would have to recommend skipping this one.",4,1,3,18 September 2017
