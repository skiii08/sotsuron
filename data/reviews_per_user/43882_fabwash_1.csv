Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," My dog is funnier
","I watched Borat for 20 minutes and couldn't handle it for more than that when the DVD went out. Now that Bruno is out, I decided to watch the entire movie. I did choke twice, but this was not laughter, it was a hahaha moment (you know when you laugh about scatological jokes because you're drunk). How can people compare this to Monty Python is beyond belief. This 'actor' is insulting people living in poor conditions in Romania (that's where the beginning of the movie was filmed), he's making fun of middle America in a way that has been done way better by American comics all over the years. There is absolutely nothing funny in this movie. You know, sometimes a movie is so dumb that you laugh at it because it's so dumb, well this one doesn't even qualify for it. I guess Benny Hill humor made it to the USA, but without the background laughs to help me enjoy the movie.",1,1,4,10 July 2009
