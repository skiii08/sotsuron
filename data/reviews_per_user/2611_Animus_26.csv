Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Force is with this film.
","Outstanding. This movie is everything you expect from Lucas and more. Ignore the nay-sayers. This movie will make you remember the first time you saw Star Wars. All the awe, all the imagination, all the incredible storytelling are here. I couldn't keep from grinning throughout the movie as I re-lived a piece of my childhood. Thank you George Lucas!",10,0,0,20 May 1999
Star Trek," Story good, science bad
","Overall I enjoyed the movie very much, it was a good story which allowed the series to be 'rebooted' rather than try to keep up with 40 years of back story, character history and confusion. Replacing the actors and some of the well know historical events was a challenge but it was well met. My only complaint is the science part of the fiction took a beating in this film, I try not to get too picky about sci-fi tech (dumping the warp core means warp drive stops right?) and the often used time travel plot device is getting real old in Trek. But I believe you have to acknowledge real universe physics and some things bugged me about this film that were just hard to ignore (science!). The basic plot about the Romulan twin home worlds being destroyed by a supernova was a big 'HUH???' moment. If a star went supernova close enough to the planets to destroy them via shock wave then I can only see 2 possibilities; either it was their own star and preventing the shock wave from devastating the worlds buys you a day at best before the worlds freeze solid or it was a star that had drifted close enough to the Romulan home system to threaten them and then stopping the shock wave just means everyone dies from gargantuan levels of radiation poisoning and disruption of the orbital path as other worlds in the system get pulverized and stellar center of gravity shifts. The 'red matter' was very vague stuff, where did it come from? Why did a single drop create a black hole? Where did the Vulcans get that much? Why did using 10,000 times as much at the end not create a super-massive black hole? Then there's the planet/moon Spock prime was marooned on which was close enough to Vulcan that you could watch the world die without optical aids yet wasn't affected by the black hole being that close by.",8,1,6,10 May 2009
Akira," Amoebas don't build nuclear bombs.
","Akira is an incredible movie that defies the splatter-gore label many people have seen fit to slap on it. Akira is a commentary on the future of society and tampering with things beyond our control. The animation is first rate, the action is good and the storyline is complex but well written. Don't feel guilty if you need to see it twice to understand it.",10,0,1,26 April 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Hilariously wrong.
",OK this movie is wrong. Everything about it is designed to offend people who want to be offended but at the same time amuse you while slapping you in the face for the hypocrisy we all deal with ever day of the year. Go see it or you'll have no one to blame but the Canadians.,7,1,1,1 July 1999
The Mummy," Very cool.
","This is a very cool movie, action, suspense, chills, horror, some light comedy, and yes a special effect or two. If you liked the Indiana Jones movies you should find this version of 'The Mummy' a fitting successor to Dr. Jones' adventures.",8,0,0,13 May 1999
Cloverfield," Stinks on toast!
","Yes, I was unimpressed by Blair Witch and I am equally unimpressed by Blair Witch 3: Cloverfield. The characters are shallow and frankly I hoped the monster would hurry up and kill them off so the camera could be picked up by someone INTERESTING who might actually know how to hold a camera, take a decent shot of the monster and most of all shut the hell up. Those army guys all seemed to have good quality helmet cams, why did we have to see the event through the eyes of these cretins? This might have made a good 15 minute web-film but it drags on and on as an almost normal length film. The rats in the subway tunnel had the right idea, run away (from this movie). Borrowing the worst from Blair Witch the film tries to make up for it for ripping off Godzilla and Alien while constantly recapping what we've just seen 5 seconds ago for posterity and asking questions to which the answer is blatantly obvious. Would have killed them to actually turn the camera towards the monster? Scenes where the monster could be seen if the camera was pointing at it, instead follow the lame character's we've been forced to watch the whole time, for someone claiming he wants to document the event, Hud seems to be allergic to actually doing so, we tend to get 1-2 seconds of monster followed by 30 seconds of whining reaction shots from the characters. The effects range from very nice to absolutely pathetic, the angled shots were worse than old batman episodes, if your actors are supposed to be walking at a harsh angle using walls for support, make sure the clothes and hair on them doesn't reveal that they are on a flat set with a tilted camera. My idea of a good exciting monster movie is not following a set of random victims who wouldn't have even rated names in the credits of a real film but one have been 'Yuppie victim #1' etc. The good news is that the boys at Rifftrax did an alternate audio track you can download and run with the film to make it watchable. Hooray for MST3k!",2,0,0,19 June 2008
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Episode 9: We fixed it.
","When I was 6 years old uncle took me and my 10 year old cousin to see the original at the local theater. The line was a few hundred people long and despite my impatience, it was worth the wait.
I loved the original movie, Empire and even the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi (I was 12).
Over decades I watched the trilogy many times and was excited when the prequels were announced.
Sadly the prequel movies were, in my opinion, crap. So when the sequel trilogy was announced I was less enthused. But The Force Awakens wasn't bad. It wasn't great but it was at least fun to watch. Sadly the Last Jedi was painfully bad - so bad in fact that for the first time in my personal history I didn't go see it in the opening week, nor the second week. In fact I didn't bother seeing it in theaters at all. Episode 8 was that bad.
So now I've watched it on Amazon Prime and Episode 9 was pretty good, much of the movie draws from Timothy Zahn's 'Thrawn' novels with the resurrected emperor and the dark fleet. Maybe that's why it's so much better than the last 5 movies.
Rise of Skywalker has it's flaws but overall it's at least as good as Return of the Jedi.",8,9,29,31 March 2020
The Matrix Revolutions," Take THAT Agent Smith!
","Wow. Not much else to say. A lot of people were disappointed with Matrix Reloaded and were worried that Revolutions would not be any good. As I expected the 3rd film payed off the expectation debt Reloaded incurred. The movie was spectacular. The ending was not what a lot of people expected. Good. I hate it when I can tell what will happen 30 minutes before it does. Great film, great trilogy, great story.",10,9,19,5 November 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," I have revised my rating...
","I originally gave the movie a lower score but I have changed it to a 10. I have since re-watched all three films and have come to see the incredible depth and detail of this series. Things I thought were silly or out of place turn out to be important and very much a part of the story. Know this, NOTHING is unimportant in these films, everything and everyone has a purpose and a meaning. The series is filled with so many metaphors and symbols that it takes hours of dissection to understand them all. But now I do and I am amazed at the complexity and subtly.",10,1,2,18 November 2003
Knowing," A very cool movie... until the last 5 minutes
","I took my girlfriend to see this and we really enjoyed the film overall. The plot a child with a gift of seeing patterns or possibly precognition or possibly divine intervention was interesting. The complexity of the clue was wonderful, the characters were well written and well acted, the spookiness (if that's a word at all) grew at a good pace throughout the film, the weaving of the events into a whole cloth was great, but then it came crashing down in the last 5 minutes. I don't know what went through Pearson's head as he penned the last chapter but I suspect the song 'Come Sail Away' by the Styx was playing on a continuous loop. Here's the spoiler folks, the angelic beings we see throughout the film trying to make contact with the child lead are aliens. Not only are they aliens they are pretty weak aliens. They sent the knowledge of Earth's impending disaster to us 50 years ago through a child. While they had the ability to foresee major disasters on a stellar and local scale, and they had the ability to translate the information into our calendar and GPS systems, they did not seem to know it would have been better to broadcast a signal instead and possibly mention the whole 'world will die in 2009' thing so that we might be motivated to do something about it. Instead they play mysterious and using their psychic powers contact some kids, make people think they are nuts and eventually spirit away a few human children and put them in a zoo. OK, maybe it's not a zoo but if it isn't, then you have a few human children dropped on an alien world with little or no survival skills and no elders to teach them anything (Thanks soooo much Mr alien, now we can all die from a thousand different problems or go feral). I was going to give the film a 8 or 9 until that part. I have hopes that a DVD release will include an alternate, non-twilight zone ending that makes sense but I'm not holding my breath...",6,0,1,30 July 2009
Twilight," Wow this was complete crap
","I watched this with my girlfriend (who told me it was complete crap) with the Rifftrax commentary running (yay for rifftrax!) and I found it amusing (the commentary not the movie). The movie was bad, I mean really bad, we're talking Plan 9 bad here, lame plot, terrible acting, storyline so thin I was afraid the screen would tear... Basically this movie is designed to appeal to 10-12 year old girls, the kind of audience who do not know what romance is but want to experience it with the 'dangerous' guys. It will appeal to the kind of person who thinks stalking and sexual assault are signs of 'love'; and that a guy who want to kill you and drink your blood is the perfect boy, the target audience seems to be the kind of girl who proposes to serial killers on death row. Me, well I now agree with my girlfriend, this movie is garbage of the worst sort since SAW came out.",2,6,7,31 May 2009
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Worse than the First
","Just watched this again and it's worse than I previously believed. Johnny has lost maturity in the sequel rather than gain it, and when his character started as an overgrown teenager thats bad. Sue has become less interesting since she seems to be there for the sole purpose of getting the Alba drool-monkeys in the theater. Reed is more of a nerd and less of a man than in the first, and he was a wuss to begin with. Ben, well he's the only one of the four who seems to be stable. Doom is back, if any one is surprised they must never have heard of the F.F. As before hes a far more interesting than the heroes, but not by much. The Surfer is well, lame. He's a bit too quick to turn on his master and I can't believe Galactus became a space cloud. I could have written a better adaptation in about 5 minutes. Special effects, yeah they are mostly good ones. But thats really the only thing this movie has going for it. Don't pay real money to see this.",2,0,1,21 March 2008
The Da Vinci Code," Very interesting and thought provoking.
","The DaVinci Code is a well acted well written bit of fiction that brings up a lot of religious doctrine and explores theories behind Christianity and looks at what may have been left out of religious tenets. The key part of this sentence is 'fiction'. The loud critics of the film and book would do well to remember the word. The movie entertains even as it seemingly undermines the church (but not the faith) of the Christian world, all the while giving the viewers more information on the early days of church than most would have ever known otherwise. I was impressed by the acting on all levels and the complexity of the films elements. The puzzle solving sequences were beautifully done without being overdone. I found the ideas put forth in the movie fascinating and am intrigued by the take on the Holy Grail legend. With respect to the people who feel threatened by the film I would like to suggest that maybe its their own belief that is shaky and not the foundations of their church.",8,1,3,21 May 2006
The Matrix Reloaded," I changed my vote after re-watching
","I originally gave the movie a lower score but I have changed it to a 10. I have since re-watched all three films and have come to see the incredible depth and detail of this series.

Joker," So dull
","2 hours of movie with about 10 minutes of interest. The Joker is a study in how to take a beloved icon and turn him into a pathetic loser that no one cares about. This Joker isn't a clown prince of crime, he's a failed clown who is terrible at his job, terrible at life and needs to be medicated to prevent delusions of competency. Sure there is a subtext of how society is fails those who need mental help, but that theme is buried under the 'eat the rich' theme where the man trying to help pull the city out of a rut is demonized.
Frankly this movie is little more than an exercise in 'woe is me'-ism and not worth the time needed to watch it.",3,8,21,16 November 2019
Hancock," Different but good
","I went to see this with fresh eyes, although I read a lot of comic books in my youth I was always intrigued by the anti-heroes who were reluctant or at least abnormal in their reasons for doing the hero thing. Hancock definitely falls into this category. Hancock is a jerk, plain and simple, he's rude, a drunkard, and selfish, but at the same time he's driven to help people, even though they hate his methods. When we finally learn why he is the way he is, it gives us a fantastic insight into why he's been such insensitive jerk all this time. All in all it's a solid hero flick and worth my ticket money. I hope there will be a sequel at some point, although Hancock might also make a good TV spin off...",8,0,1,11 July 2008
Lord of War," An interesting, if somewhat unfocused, movie...
","I liked the movie, but over all it seems to become less than the sum of it's parts. Acting-wise its put together seamlessly. While Nicholas Cage has not always chosen wisely in his acting roles, he does an admirable in his portrayal of the lead in Lord of War. In fact most of the actors seem well suited to their roles. The script seems solid enough and well written. It is in the focus of the movie seems to be missing. Lord of War starts out as a sort of black comedy then becomes a morality tale and ends more as political statement, the movie cant seem to decide if it wants to be entertaining, thought provoking, or just prompt political and moral outrage in the audience. A good film, if a bit confusing on that note.",8,5,10,18 September 2005
Arrival," WOW!
","I love a good sci-fi movie and ones with a mystery are always a plus, but Arrival blew me away. I can't say much without spoiling things but the whole story is amazing, well thought out and just incredible to see unfold. The fuse has a slow but steady burn and when the firework ignites it lights up everything.",10,0,0,23 April 2020
Prometheus," An amazing idea that is ruined pretty quickly
","The opening sequence was the best part of the film, the idea is that on a barren world capable of sustaining life, one of these 'engineers' sacrifices himself to start the evolutionary process. Beautiful. BUT the question that keeps popping up in the movie is 'Why'? Why would it be necessary to do so, I mean they have interstellar travel capability, why not just mix up some 'evolutionary soup' and drop it in the ocean, why sacrifice someone? ************************Spoiler alert***************** If the planet was supposed to be earth then why did we evolve into a genetically identical species after 3 billion years? Even if it wasn't Earth, then why would they visit us several times and leave us a map of how to find them, when the map only points us to an outpost world where they park ships? Why were the engineers fleeing through their ship into a room full of hyper-evolutionary bio-juice? What was chasing them and what happened to it? Why does the last of these engineers, asleep for 2000 years, want to kill everyone the moment he wakes up? Why would he want to wipe out our world? I know I can be grumpy when I wake but that's a bit extreme. Some thoughts occurred to me that maybe these bio-warfare engineers were not the same as those seen in the beginning sequence, but that would mean more than one species of genetically identical sentient beings arose on different worlds in roughly the same time frame which would take us into whole new realms of improbability. If they were the same engineers as those in the beginning and that was Earth, then they haven't evolved much at all in 3 billion years. Too many questions, no where near enough answers. And that's not even going into the ridiculousness of the crew and the Prometheus. Between archaeologists who poke everything and contaminate locations that have been sealed for 20 centuries, space suits with GLASS bubble helmets, hyper advanced auto-docs that can't handle the difference between male and female anatomy, reanimating alien heads that have been dead for 2000 years, frail old men who survive hibernation which we see makes healthy people weak and sick, and scientists who don't know the difference between carbon dioxide (CO2, not deadly at 3% purity) and carbon monoxide (CO, deadly at 1.2% purity) I have to say the movie fails on almost all levels of sense-making. I gave it 5 stars because of two things, the opening and the beautiful imagery of the film.",5,3,6,20 October 2012
Blade Runner," A finely crafted movie that makes you wonder what it is that makes you human.
","Blade Runner, hailed as one of the great SciFi movies, manages to combine science, action and philosophy into one beautifully made package. The movie makes you wonder- 'What is it that makes you human?' If it looks human, acts human and (thanks to implanted memories) *thinks* it's human, and has developed free will, is still an android? Based on the novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' the movie adaptation loses a lot of the deeper subtext but still manages to convey the problem with creating artificial humans, if they grow emotionally doesn't that make them human too? One thing I missed that was in the novel was the 'mood organ' which allowed humans to control their moods artificially, insuring they were happy with their jobs and their lives. If your emotions and mental state are artificial does it make you less human? Still the movie is excellent, I recommend it to all.",9,0,0,26 April 1999
Fantastic Four," if only the villain had been good....
","Not a bad film, but hardly a good one. They re-wrote the background story, threw in a poor romantic subplot between Reed and Sue, The inhuman Grimm had the most human reactions of any of the characters, the action was good but the plot and story were pathetic and F/X, while beautifully done, was overblown to the point of hilarity. But the biggest disappointment was Doom, the character of Doom was a dismal conversion from the comics. This poor character was gutted from would-be World Conquering megalomaniac who combined magic and super-science and turned into a 3rd rate Norman Osboure Jr. A would-be corporate raiding CEO who gets 2 completely unrelated powers, which in itself is odd, since the rest of the people exposed got 1 power each and Doom was the best protected of the 5. Now on to what I liked, mostly the little things, Reed's befuddlement with interpersonal relationships, Johnny's hotshot attitude, Ben's mourning over his lost humanity, and the easily overlooked details like Johnny always drinking water after the change (because with an internal body temp of 200+ you DON'T give him alcohol). If Doom had been done better or if Alba hadn't been sleepwalking through her part it could have gotten a 7.",4,2,5,11 July 2005

","That question is what the movie is all about, and I won't spoil it for you, but be warned while the movie can be mind blowing - it can also be nightmare fuel.",8,2,4,23 April 2020
Warcraft," To call it a steaming pile of sh!t would be a compliment
","I know movies based on video games are normally bad but this one aspires to be bad and fails. Warcraft WISHES it was only Bad instead of the insipid pile of dung that was flung on the screen. Some people say they want their money back, others say they want their 2 hours back... this 'movie' makes me regret ever playing the game since my monthly subscription probably contributed to this offense against film-making and story-telling in some way. Save yourself, avoid seeing this travesty of celluloid... and if you must see it for some reason (abduction with a gun at your head for instance) drink heavily in the hope of blacking out before the opening credits. In the words of the Critic - IT SUCKS",2,3,4,10 August 2016
Alien: Covenant," It's bad, make no mistake.
","The latest travesty in the Alien franchise manages to have a cast of character even dumber than those seen in Prometheus. I lost count of how many idiotic things they did about halfway through. The villain telegraphs 'I'm EVIL' so hard he might as well have had Darth Vader's theme playing constantly.
Mr Scott, PLEASE stop writing Alien movies, all you do is screw it up. there were some excellent stories in the Dark Horse Comics and a couple of wonderfully written books that would make GREAT movies.",5,1,2,27 May 2020
V for Vendetta," Impressive storyline impressive acting
",Can you win an Oscar for a role in which your face is never seen? I think you can after seeing Hugo Weaving as 'V'. Playing a role where he is covered head to toe and wears an unchanging mask Hugo still gives the best performance of all in a movie filled with good acting. He manages to convey all the emotions and draw out the audiences sympathy and outrage with only his voice and movements. Natalie Portman does a fine job as Evie from her characters shock to her fear and ultimately her resolve. The story is an excellent warning about giving too much power to the government and allowing fear to guide politics. The action sequences are beautifully done but not over-done as in many movies these days. Hopefully this movie will do well and show Hollywood you don't need to be a matrix clone or a sequel/prequel to be a good film.,10,2,5,18 March 2006
The Island," Clonus Horrors Revisited
","Ouch. I knew this movie would never live up to the hype as soon as I saw the trailer and recognized the plot as a direct steal from 'Parts:The Clonus Horror' a movie a gleefully laughed at on Mystery Science Theater 3000 some years ago. Although this remake has been jazzed up and given spiffy special effects and a huge budget for blowing things up the story is just as badly thought out. The plot leaks like a sieve,life for the clones is un-fulfilling and is causing psychological problems for some (meds anyone?), the huge number of people working behind the scenes to keep things secret (that many people can't keep a secret, lowly wage slaves least of all), holographs to display the 'contaminated' world (they are UNDERGROUND, just tell them that), and of course the fact that at least 50 or more people were killed in the chase scenes, no one would ever notices that in LA. Sigh but worst was the ending, it was so ripped from 'Logan's Run' I expected to see Peter Ustinov waving at the clones. Yay, they are free.... in the middle of the Arizona desert... with no food or water... and no press to show the world.... right. Save your money. Save your mind.",3,39,66,28 July 2005
