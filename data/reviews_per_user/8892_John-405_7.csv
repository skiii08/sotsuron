The Blair Witch Project," Wonderful -- definitely not 'Night of the Living Dead for the Millennium'
","No spoilers here, IMO, but read at your peril.Most of the negative comments about this film seem to come from hard core horror buffs who fail to find it particularly frightening.  The problem is that hard core horror fans have been hooked on so much blood, gore and cheap frights that anything that asks them to use their imaginations is going to seem boring.As someone who is not particularly a horror buff, I thought Blair Witch was brilliant.I should say that I walked into the theater ignorant of any of the hype surrounding the film. I had seen a preview, and so knew the basic premise, but that was it.The three principles are more or less completely believable, which is probably due to the fact that their situation in real life was as close as possible to their characters' situation.  They really were left to wander in the woods, and they knew only generally what they would find there.  There is nothing profound about the film's content.  The 3 film students are typical slacker dumb bells, and they react to their situation with honest fright and little else. There is little time for philosophizing, but you get the feeling that even if there were these three would have little to say.The brilliance of the film lies completely in its concept: the idea of throwing three actors in the woods and asking them to improvise on their own fear.  The result is extremely compelling and convincing.  There are little clues here and there that the 3 are acting, but, for the most part, they appear to actually be 3 people lost in the woods being terrorized by a coven of witches!There is *one* glimpse of blood in the entire film and zero glimpses of the witches (or whatever they may be).  The horror is left entirely to the imagination and the oblique ending resists the urge to explain.  As the credits rolled, I was really grateful that the film makers hadn't tried to make this a 'Night of the Living Dead for the Millennium'.Oh, and one other comment: Some reviewers have complained that it is unbelievable that Heather would keep filming, even when her life was in danger.  Actually, that is is not so hard to believe when you consider all of the documentary films that have been done in life-threatening situations during war time.  Heather may be a little more professional than you would expect a 20-something film student to be, but she's hardly unique or without example in real life.J",Null,1,1,26 July 1999
Citizen Kane," Wait until you mature and see it again
","Most of the negative comments this film has received have apparently been from young people.  I saw CK for the first time when I was 19 and hated it. I then saw it a year and a half later and loved it.  What happened?  Well, my tastes matured a bit, and I had the benefit of having seen it before.Now, more than a decade later, I've seen the film on video perhaps 20 times, and three or four times on screen.  (Alas, and inexplicably, CK has yet to be released to DVD!).  It is, I have no doubt, the greatest American film ever made.  What is good about it has nothing to do with camera, lighting, technique, or any such nonsense.  It is perfect the way a piece of music can be perfect--and, as with music, it is impossible to say in words just what it is that makes it so great.Wait a few years, my young friends, and see this movie again.  Do people still mature or is that old-fashioned?",Null,0,1,15 February 2001
American Psycho," A bit disappointing
","The creed of American yuppies in the 80s can be basically summed up as 'egoism' -- the formalism of selfishness, an ethic whose only constraint is punishment.  In the absence of punishment anything goes, and, if you play your cards right, risking punishment can be just as innocuous as, say, risking your life each time you get into an automobile.  If all there is is the self, why should there be any constraint on action except punishment of the self?  A smart, careful business plan seeks to minimize risk, of course, but risk must be the price paid for getting what you want.  No pain, no gain, as we used to say in the 80s.It is a fact that the majority of murders go unsolved. It is compelling to imagine a yuppie egoist, therefore, on Wall St in the 80s, who accepts the risk of punishment as an acceptable price to pay for the reward of indulging in pleasure killings.  The 'logic' of this decision is as compelling as the logic of laying off thousands to raise your stock price or trashing the environment so your comapny can be a 2 billion dollar company instead of just a billion dollar one.  Why let compassion get in the way of gettin' what you want?This script seems to miss this tantalizing allegorical angle in favor of becoming yet another Hitchcock-esque thriller. Patrick Bateman isn't a coldly calculating yuppie weekend murderer, he's an out-of-control psycho, who scrawls grotesque scenes of torture in his appointment book and who thinks the ATM machine is telling him to feed it cats.  This is a comforting view of serial killers, one that makes them so different from you and me that we can comfortably and conveniently avoid asking the hard questions about what turns a human being into a murderer.  Eh, they're just nuts! My, how illuminating.What if serial killers weren't just nuts?  What if they were rational, even, after a fashion, 'normal' people who had intelligently rationalized themselves into turning off their consciences?   There are a lot of screen killers who approach this sort of character, but the film makers must usually find something in them which makes them seem weird or alien or otherwise deeply disturbed.  In American Psycho, I rather hoped that our killer would be a true mirror of ourselves, not just another psycho freak, easily dismissed as an aberration. A real villain is one who can smile while doing evil, someone who is almost likeable.  A ranting madman is just a ranting madman.",Null,0,0,17 April 2000
Being John Malkovich," Very fresh and clever, but is that saying much?
","Art film is dead.  That may seem a funny way to introduce a positive review of BJM, but the cleverness and skill of this film are painful reminders that, as good as this is, this is really the best it *can* get anymore.  And the best it can get is really not very good.Twenty years ago, this sort of thing would have been considered a particularly original Hollywood screwball comedy, or weird sci-fi film, kind of like one of Terry Gilliam's outings. But it ain't an art film, and I don't know that I've really seen an art film *anywhere* about *anything* for years.What is an art film?  Last Year at Marienbad was an art film. Picnic at Hanging Rock was an art film.  Fitzcarraldo was an art film.  Walkabout was an art film.  Aguirre the Wrath of God was an art film.These were original, serious and thought-provoking films.Arguably BJM is original, serious and thought provoking in technique, even in plot, but really nothing about it is terribly original in concept.  The themes are actually pretty hackneyed: stardom, our obsessions with stardom, the nature of individuality, the differences between men and women, etc. Ho hum.  How many times have we rehashed those before?There are no grand themes anymore.  Everything is irony and cynicism, irony and cynicism.  ARRRGH!  Doesn't anyone have anything challenging to say?  I'll even take pretentious. Just once I'd like to see an art film that wasn't:1) a variation on a tried and true hollywood format (Central Station)2) a 'naive', simplistic film about 'emotions' (Children of Heaven)3) a pop-culture, 'post-human', self-satisfied genX feature (anything by that Tarrantino monster)4) technically innovative but intellectually vapid (Blair Witch Project)Is there a director out there who has the cajones to be an intellectual? Hello? Anybody?",Null,0,0,4 November 1999
The Iron Giant," Genuine sentiment without corn
","Like all high quality animations, this is a movie for kids and adults.  The vividly drawn relationship between the giant and the boy is the most...human...and touching (without being maudlin) that I can remember in recent years, and that includes both children's films and so-called adult drama.  For that reason, maybe, it drew genuine emotion out of me, something that hasn't happened since I first saw Barry Lyndon (of all things) years ago.
It's sad that Disney has such a stranglehold on the genre. I was so grateful that there was not a single syrupy pop song in this movie that on the strength of that alone I might award it a '10' on IMDb.  But fortunately, Iron Giant succeeds more for what it is than what it isn't.",10,1,2,13 August 1999
Gladiator," Cliched epic
","I liked the comment of one reviewer, who said that scenes of Elysium were like 'a luxury car commercial'.  So true, I kept expecting a disembodied voice to say, 'try the new Chariot Romanus, id est optimus!'Someone poured millions into this and hired a competent director, a competent, sullen actor and competent script writer, and they all made a movie which I reluctantly went to see and now wish I hadn't wasted two hours of my priceless 3 score and 10.  I learn slowly, but I'm learning....",Null,0,0,7 May 2000
The Wizard of Oz," Sorry, but I always disliked this film
","I wish I could be more specific as to why, but all my life I have found this film to be...well, creepy and unappealing.  I know this is a kid's movie and a certain degree of over-acting is to be expected, but still I find the performances unconvincing and rather dumbed-down and over-broad even for the genre.    My wife, who is a great L. Frank Baum fan, introduced me to the OZ books when we were in college, and I could see how the film completely and unnecessarily changed aspects of the story, effectively ruining the book's atmosphere of daft fantasy.  The original has a simple, good-natured charm, completely at odds with the impression the film gives of forced, kitchy, gaudy clownishness. Other attempts to bring Baum to the screen have been limited by a similar disrespect for the integrity of the original material. I hope Hollywood will wise up and one day present a Baum book in the spirit it was intended.",Null,0,1,23 February 2000
