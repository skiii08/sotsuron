Blade Runner 2049," Its a logical less stupid movie
",Its an emotional torture for couple of hours. I hope Hollywood is capable of making interesting and entertaining movies and can cut the crap like this. May be as the title suggests 2049 should've been released then and we could've been saved from this movie. Please avoid this movie at any cost.,1,10,21,30 October 2017
