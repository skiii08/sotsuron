Casablanca," one of the greatest films of all time for a reason and not what i expected
",as its dawning on me that most of the reviews i have posted for the last few weeks never became public and in some cases simply disappeared i am attempting to recapture the magic of what i wrote the first time... i had known of Casablanca for years before finally seeing it just a few weeks ago i don't remember what my initial impression of it was past i figured it was dopey and romantic had something to do with a plane and was black and white... however now having seen it all my preconceptions of the movie have vanished i thoroughly enjoyed the film... Bogart is great in this i would watch more of his stuff because of this one film... i think what i liked most about it aside from the noir-ish look of the film is that it is a minimalist approach to a war film. the greatest villains of all time the Nazis fill the antagonist role the characters are brilliantly played particularly the lovably crooked police inspector who provides some comic relief... as per usual or seemingly so the photography and sound were pristine... i think that can be attributed to my time editing terrible quality video clips... however it doesn't matter nothing about the actual production was distracting... as a musician the fake piano playing was noticeable but it didn't matter i enjoyed the movie too much to care... i love the stark lighting in movies from this period... the mood is so thick you could cut it with a knife... and the message that you cant stay neutral forever rings true today... sadly i cant remember half of what i wrote originally but i think i made my point,Null,0,1,6 November 2011
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," i love Paul Newman i love this movie but i have always hated the music
",i remember watching this movie when i was younger and frankly i didn't remember too much of it just the end and their first major escape... now the picture is pretty clear throughout and some of the on location photography is amazing particularly the mountains and valleys in the escape... the mostly true story carries itself well Newman and Redford ARE the reason to watch this movie... their hilarious on screen chemistry is the highlight... the visuals and ultimately basic photography capture the action perfectly... the use of montages to bypass slow spot in the adventure was interesting but i felt slowed the story down... the music unfortunately is atrociously weird and dates the film more so than knowing Paul Newman is long gone (a real bummer every time i think about it) the movie is a classic and is very good if music is my only concern id say thats a pretty small concern the action and characters carry you through and save the day... that is a testament to the acting... watch this film,7,0,0,13 December 2011
The Grapes of Wrath," disappointed with the digital transfer
",as much as a story can be excellent and a legendary and highly regarded as one of the best in history a visual experience can ruin it for you... for some of the same reasons i panned easy rider i can look at and be disappointed with the grapes of wrath... the timeless story or a displaced family in the great depression is half enhanced by the grainy look of the film half inhibited by the light flickering and dark photography... some night and indoor scenes at least in the copy i saw was impossible to see the action... the sound however was excellent... i am aware of the age of the film but i would imagine they would do a better job cleaning up this classic film... which i feel was over rated by nostalgic idiots that praise things that were already popular... the story carries much emotional weight and the acting is all very good but if you cant see or are distracted by the visual presentation on an HD monitor something is wrong... its still an essential classic i just need to try and find a cleaner copy i guess,5,1,3,16 December 2011
The Exorcist," what a wonderful day for an exorcism
",the movie the exorcist has a reputation as one of those horribly disturbing films that raised huge amounts of controversy upon its release causing people to become sick and mortified the religious and faint of heart. this starkly filmed picture boasts gruesome makeup effects and some insanely cool possession set pieces... the acting never felt like acting... perhaps the actors were just as horrified by what the girl was saying as their characters were... the lighting is a key factor here as some of the scenes the light borders on being a character... Regan's face is disfigured and contorted but the stark shadows is what really makes it demonic... the music is especially fitting i was surprised the iconic tubular bells only played twice in the whole picture... the picture itself is flawless the copy i have showed no signs that it is from the 70s no scratches no markers and the grain only helps make the picture look darker and more severe... watch as a very normal situation slowly goes mad and out of control... the entire look of the film is different by the time the credits roll... as a horror fan its an absolute essential as a movie buff... its still essential... definitely not for the faint of heart... highly recommended,9,1,2,11 December 2011
The Usual Suspects," I am afraid of Keyser Söze
",i only just saw this recently and really i wish i saw it earlier!... this is not your average ensemble cast crime film... really its a well acted scripted movie with a very ship shape Stephen Baldwin a hilarious baby faced Benicio Del Torro Kevin Pollock being a very angry man Kevin spacey as our crippled narrator and second protagonist and Gabriel Byrne as the persecuted dean Keaton... a man driven to crime by the police... loaded with action mystery and intrigue will keep you wondering till the end while not being hard to follow... and an ending that is sure to stay with you... if you aren't paying attention the jumps in time may lose you but its not easy to lose interestPOSSIBLY SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINTKeaton a recently straight con is dragged into the police station to be a part of a lineup... before i tell you that i have to tell you this... the story is told in the form of flashbacks by Kevin spaceys character verbal... in the aftermath of a bloodbath and explosion the police are questioning the only living witness to the incident verbal... the cops seem certain that dean Keaton was responsible and believe him to still be alive despite verbals earnestly telling them he is dead... verbal outlines the events leading up to the explosion at the pier starting with the lineup... followed with a plot to get revenge against the police by exposing their shady dealings... which leads to their employment for more jobs... (back with the interrogation) when the police follow a lead and ask verbal about Keyser Söze everything takes a wild turn... (back to the story) the group is hired by a mr kobayashi who is and underling of soze... they have to do a job that borders on suicidal to earn their pardon from sozes wrath... the aftermath of the job is whats being investigated and the tale convoluted was Keaton behind it? is he alive?gotta see it to believe it highly recommended,Null,0,0,23 September 2011
Singin' in the Rain," i loved this... did i mention i hate musicals?
",today we are going to watch a movie... yay! its a musical... aw crap... *2 hours later* holy crap that was great! singin in the rain is one of the movies you always hear about as a movie buff... without exception it has been on all the top 20 lists i have ever seen for classic cinema... frankly i t deserves it... this film is hysterical from start to finish... chronicling a key period in film the transition from silent to sound films... all the characters are great even the ones we aren't supposed to like... my personal favorite being Cosmo he is just hilarious at all times... the coloring in the film is superb especially for the early days of color... the photography was beautiful only once was there a noticeable scratch and it was clearly the end of a reel or something but otherwise it went without issue the sound was great *the exception being where they made fun of sound quality* the dance numbers were choreographed amazingly (by Gene Kelly if i remember right) tap numbers peppered throughout the tapping well recorded... the only time the song and dance really wore on me was the Broadway gotta dance bit which dragged on a little... the make em laugh scene is my favorite number by far mostly because Donald o'Connor as Cosmo is a total boss... my favorite non musical scene is the problem ridden scene making the disastrous swordsman movie... that was too funny... an interesting bit of trivia is that the dubbed Lina's voice in the movie with Kathy's however in real life jean hagen 'Lina' dubbed the singing for Debbie Reynolds 'Kathy' so Lina dubbed Kathy dubbing Lina.... anyway if i keep going ill write a book... good movie HIGHLY recommended,Null,0,1,6 November 2011
Psycho," Hitchcock presents THE horror film
",as an avid horror fan getting to go back and watch Psycho not just because i felt like it but with the intent to examine it was an interesting proposition and one that gave me a greater appreciation for the film. Alfred Hitchcock has assembled some of the greatest psychological thrillers and cerebral horror films ever made... Psycho is no exception. superbly acted especially by the timelessly unnerving Anthony Perkins... this movie features great camera work and cinematography... the use of shadow and obscured vision really sells some of the tensest moments Hitchcocks semi surreal sensibilities add the mysterious air that keeps the viewer in a vice and squeezes till the buildup is too much to bear... the exposition takes a little while to get through but once its rolling there is no stopping it.... the score in this film is not only suer effective it is among the most recognizable pieces of music in history. the copy i saw was i think one of the cleaned up anniversary editions so the picture and sound were stellar... there isn't much i can say that hasn't been said to death about psycho,Null,0,0,9 November 2011
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," if you don't like this movie you are crazier than they are
",i saw the last half of this movie years and years ago and didn't understand it... its a complex and compelling character driven drama that takes place for the most part in the plainly lit and shot angular world of a mental hospital... i was 8... nowadays i not only saw the film start to finish i could look at it as an aspiring film maker with a fresh appreciation for not only the powerful immortal characterizations portrayed but the brilliantly simple camera work. like i said the movie takes place in a hospital so the characters don't have far to run (the less disabled characters anyway some never move) instead the cameras job is simply to stay put and record the subtleties and nuances of each actors screen time... nothing more nothing less... the lighting is simple hospital lights daylight or dimly lit night... the technical aspects of the film are there to frame the acting not to dazzle or distract the audience... the acting is superb powerful and Oscar worthy... also worth mention is the fact i nearly died when i realized danny devito was in this movie... many actors i didn't realize were in this deliver some of the better characters notably christopher lloyd and brad douriff i wont say much of the story except that its a roller-coaster from start to finish and its worth watching a few times,9,1,3,4 December 2011
