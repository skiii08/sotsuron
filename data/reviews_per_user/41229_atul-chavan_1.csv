Airlift," Sureshot Blockbuster with full dose of Patriotism and Entertainment
","I am Akshay Kumar fan from childhood and I have watched almost all movies of Akshay Kumar. I feel Airlift is the best movie of Akshay Kumar. The movie is based on true story and shot in locations which looks like real ones. The story is gripping and moves with decent pace. Viewers will literally feel a sense of sympathy for the Indians trapped in Kuwait.Raja Krishna Menon has worked very hard and done his job very well. While watching movie, viewers don't find any loop holes in direction, story, screenplay.Akshay has given his 100% and is best work of his career. Akshay deserves national award for this movie. Nimrat Kaur does her job very well. Purab Kohli make his present felt. All other actors has done their job quite efficiently.Overall, Airlift is a great and entertaining film. A Must watch and a treat for classy audience.",10,0,1,28 January 2016
