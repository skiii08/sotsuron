The Avengers," Good But Not Great; Wonder Why it is in IMDb top films!
","I would give it 7 or 7.5 out of 10. It is a very good film, but nothing great. Believe me or not. I watched it yesterday night at the South Delhi PVR Priya Cinema Hall (3D; hated their scratchy defective glasses which needed changing for many people).The first half was just okay (actually even boring) and the intermission point was so ill-timed and then the second half was good. The fight scenes in the city (Manhattan) are like the latest Transformers. A one time watch for sure; but don't expect much. I liked the film but not as much as I had expected it to like! There are many enthralling scenes but the number of boring frames (particularly in the first half) is also abundant. The villain is not so menacing or dignified (like the all-powerful villain of X-Men 3). He needed more teeth. And I am not alone in thinking so; five of my friends with me have similar opinion. You don't miss much if you miss the Avengers.",7,8,19,1 May 2012
A Star Is Born," VERY BAD FILM, CLOSED IT AFTER 30 MINS.
","I read only here that the female lead is Lady Gaga. Frankly, I had not seen her until this day. Neither my wife. We closed the film after 30 mins. Nothing special, very boring. She is not convincing at all (voice nothing extraordinary; neither the acting skills). Bradley acted well as always.",5,1,6,17 January 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Absolutely Must-see film: 11/10.
","What a film. So much is there. You should just see it and not read reviews, hehe. This should have got the best film Oscar.",10,2,6,6 March 2018
The Lost City of Z," 10/10 Delight! A Must-see.
","I and my wife had seen it in Paris as part of a film festival (paid 4e ticket, summer 2017). It surprised us pleasantly. Engrossing story, cinematography, sensitive portrayal. This film is a winner led by the lead actor Charlie Hunnam (whom we again found in Triple Frontier yesterday on Netflix).",10,0,0,14 March 2019
The Machinist," A Very Good Film—Must See it.
","Actually you can even give it 9 out of 10. It's a very good film and I recommend it—definitely. If you like thriller and mystery, you are going to love it.The whole film has shades of dark and is reminiscent of something, which we discover towards the end when the mystery unravels.After the film, I did some research on the film: Christian lost more than 28 kilograms for this film! That simply means how dedicated he was for the film and it really shows as you watch the film.This is probably my maiden review on IMDb and not without reasons—watch the Machinist and find it out yourself. Great acting by all, great story with justice, in the end. Christian Bale rocks! Not everyone will like this film though—many people like their movies to be loud and obvious; such people can avoid this film and watch his other films.",9,1,2,30 April 2011
Army of Darkness," SAVE TIME, SKIP IT.
","We closed it after 40 mins. Boring, CARICATURAL. The famous director has lowered himself with this one. It was a serious letdown.",4,2,7,23 July 2018
Parasite," Ignore the hype.
",It's a good movie. But nothing so great. LOBBYING SHOULD BE BANNED in any film award process for impartial decisions.,6,2,5,22 April 2020
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," It's very good but not exceptional: Comments by an Indian
","I watched it today morning at DT Cinema (Vasant Kunj, South Delhi, India)in 3D. I enjoyed the film. It is, as I said, very good but not exceptional as I expected it to be. I wish it was a bit longer; there was scope for it.I have not read the book and had minor problems understanding the plot. I wish the final war particularly with Voldemort was more exquisite and awe-inspiring.I would have liked it as much in 2D if not more; 3D was mostly dark (grey). The films feels a bit rushed through at places. It has great action just the same. Watch it to bid adieu to the franchise.",8,0,5,17 July 2011
