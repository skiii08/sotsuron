Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," What a movie
","I recently saw this movie and couldn't stop laughing the whole time! The whole movie was funny, from the beginning to the end. All the jokes and reactions of the people were great, especially when he goes to the rodeo and tells everyone that he supports the war and sings the anthem! Also when he is taking the driving test and makes stupid jokes that the instructor doesn't really get. The end maybe was too ridiculous, Pamela running in the parking lot....funny but a little dumb. This character Borat is the best Sacha has ever done. Some times I didn't know if it was real or staged, but still hilarious! I like him as Ali G but now I love Borat even more! I hope he'll make another movie like this soon! You rock Sacha!",7,2,6,20 November 2006
