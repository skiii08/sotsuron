The New World," not sure about this movie
","I thought the acting was very well done. What I didn't like about the movie was the dialog was weak and the camera work was too fast and jittery. I'm not sure if they used enough microphones but it was very hard understanding what they were saying, I had to watch the movie in subtitles. It's an OK movie, it kinda drags really not letting you know what was going on and there was a lot of scenes that was just nonsense and pointless there was just too much skipping. Another issue I wasn't happy with was the soundtrack was horrible and annoying. Once again I was let down for another high hope historical movie. Personally I think they could of put more thought and effort into the movie and made it more dramatical, but like i said the acting was good but thats about it.",3,0,4,24 April 2007
