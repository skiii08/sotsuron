Alien 3," sucks, especially when compared with the others
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Sure alien was cool, aliens was really cool and alien resurection was ok but this movie is a disgrace to the series. Ridley scott and james cameron directed the 1st 2 which is why they r much better but who is the guy who directed this? i've never heard of him and he can't compare with james cameron. See this movie only so you might be able to understand resurection and for the cool alien effects but the people don't even fight the alien in this one. they at least try in all the others but most of the prisoners are killed by an accedental explosion. No one in this movie can act either. They only made this movie to try and copy ridley scott's and james cameron's sucess with this movie. i feel sorry for all those who saw this in theaters",1,296,312,10 July 2002
Training Day," very good
","*spoilers* This movie shows denzel washington at his best. he deserved to oscar he won for this role. but this movie is definitly not for kids.

But it has a great story, plot twists, and great acting.  see it. you wont regret it.  too bad the really cool car denzel washington has get destroyed.  5 out of 5",10,2,13,31 July 2002
The Birth of a Nation," Hard to Watch
","This film is hard to watch for many reasons. First, it is a 3 hour silent film. That alone is a feat for some. Also, the content is very distasteful to modern audiences. The film is about the founding of the KKK and it endorses every terrible stereotype and racist attitude you can think of about black people in the south. And the white northerners are certainly portrayed in a bad light as well. Its as if this film was made during Reconstruction and just released in 1915.On the other hand, this is an important thing to see for those who are lovers of film history. To my knowledge, it is the first feature film and it is certainly interesting to see these racial attitudes so blatantly displayed in a mainstream film. But it is certainly not for the casual viewer. I love movies and history and I could not watch this all at once. A 3 hour silent film, especially with this content, was just took much at once but I think it is something every film lover should see at least once if for no other reason than to understand the history of film.",4,3,6,22 September 2010
Windtalkers," The best war movie ever
",*spoilers* I have always liked war movies and john woo movies and this is the best of both worlds. i have no idea why so many people hate this movie. there is so much action and it portrays the Japanese as they really were. The japanese would charge out in the open because they always  fought to the death. it was called a banzai charge. and who cares about the navajo backround. this is a war movie not a history channel special.  why does a movie have to be realistic? what happened to just enjoying a movie for what it is? fantasy. it isn't real. it is just made for entertainment which this movie does very well.  this movie was BASED on true events. it never said the movie was totaly true. this movie is also cool because of the body count. the body count in this movie rivals commando. john woo movies have lots of action and so do war movies. this is what you get is you combine them. my only complaint is that nicholas cage didn't jump sideways with 2 pistols like he does in face/off.,10,2,7,15 July 2002
Valkyrie," Generally a solid thriller
","This is a decent, but not great, WW 2 film. It works pretty effectively as a thriller/spy movie, at least early on. And it does an effective job of keeping up suspense considering that it is fairly common historical knowledge that the plot against Hitler failed. Where the film mostly succeeds is in setting up a conspiracy and the characters not knowing who to trust initially. After this takes place, the film ceases to be seriously suspenseful because the end is assured. It's hard to truly enjoy a thriller when the suspense is counter balanced by knowing the ending already. So, the only real suspense later in the film can come from who lives and who dies but the characters have fully committed to the assassination plot knowing that if it fails they would be executed.",6,2,8,27 December 2008
