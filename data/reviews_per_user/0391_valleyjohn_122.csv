Ford v Ferrari," Pure adrenaline rush
","You can't beat a good old racing car movie . Ever since movies began there have been films about racing . I think they are popular because it's a very uncomplicated format and it's easy for the audience to get caught up in the excitement of what's happening on screen and that's certainly the case with this movie .This is the story of American car designer Carroll Shelby and the fearless British-born driver Ken Miles , who together battled corporate interference, the laws of physics, and their own personal demons to build a revolutionary race car for Ford Motor Company and take on the dominating race cars of Enzo Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in France in 1966.This is an incredibly enjoyable movie . It looks and sounds fantastic and the two lead performances from Damon and Bale are great .
I loved the side show battle with the suits at Ford . Although obviously exaggerated for dramatic effect , the interference from these corporate idiots is almost as much fun as the racing .For some stupid reason this movie has two titles . In America it's called Ford Vs Ferrari and in the rest of the world it's called Le Mans ' 66 . The director , James Mangold says it's for legal reasons but the consensus is that it was changed because most of the American public have not heard of Le Mans.
I find that hard to believe.",8,1,1,16 February 2020
The King's Speech," Great acting from the entire cast.
","It's amazing , the fascination people have with the British Royal family and how well films seem to do that have this odd family as the subject. The Kings speech is a an excellent movie that taught me a thing or two about the history of what happened when Edward VIII abdicated and his less confident , stammering , brother took over the royal reigns. It's true that Colin Firth is brilliant in the lead role role but i was as , impressed ( if not more ) with Geoffrey Rush who played his speech therapist. This is such an easy film to watch and the 1 hour 51 minutes flies by. If i have to be critical it is that i was a little disappointed with the climax of the movie when the king makes his famous war address. It looks likely that this film will sweep the board at this years Academy Awards and although it is a great film ii still prefer '127 hours' .",8,0,0,31 January 2011
Moneyball," Just another film about a sport nobody outside America cares about.
","I read from a reviewer that you didn't have to know anything about baseball to enjoy Moneyball and that it was a worthy Oscar nominated movie. He was wrong on both counts. Having nearly seen nearly all this years best picture nominated films i have to say , that apart from Tree of Life , it's been a very average year and Moneyball sums up what i mean.This is the story of Billy Beane , The General manager of The Oakland Athletics an American baseball team . Beane realises he cannot compete with the big boys financially so along with Peter Brand a statistics and finance wizard , he builds a record winning team out of journeyman Baseball players. I know nothing about Baseball and because of this i didn't have a clue what was happening when they were discussing the sport. Sure , i understand the fundamentals of the story but it's nowhere near enough to get me interested. Brad Pitt is good as is Jonah Hill but at the end of the day it's bloody a Baseball movie Zzzzzzzzzz.Moneyball is yet another self obsessed movie about an American sport that the rest of the world cares nothing about and how this gets nominated for an Oscar is beyond me.",6,1,5,13 February 2012
Vertigo," Hitchcock's masterpiece? Never
","In a year when there has been some odd films , films that are not easy to explain ( Shutter Island , Black Swan , Inception etc..) , i thought i was on safe ground watching a good old fashioned Alfred Hitchcock thriller but little did i know this is just as unexplainable as any of those films i have named . Vertigo is sometimes called ' Hitchcock's masterpiece' but i don't see it. This is a long ponderous movie that makes very little sense and treats the viewer with contempt. Jimmy Stewart is watchable but his character is not very believable and the relationship with Kim Novak is confusing and annoying. I much prefer Rear Window or Psycho to this movie and to be perfectly honest i couldn't wait for it to finish.",4,18,31,2 March 2011
Black Swan," Swan lake or a swan dive?
","Just what i need , another film that is confusing and is difficult to understand. We had it with Inception last year and in previous films like The Fountain , The Matrix and Fight club. Call me old fashioned but i like to understand what I'm watching. The best way i can describe this is that is a modern take on the Ballet , Swan Lake. Swan lake within a Swan Lake. It involves a girl who has to somehow transform her whiter than white style of dancing in such a way that she can perform as the Black Swan. While this transformation happens , she mentally breaks down. I've seen this described as a Psychological thriller and if you read that too you might be a bid disappointed with the outcome. It's not really a thriller more a drama and if you like The Ballet you will love this. I don't hence i was underwhelmed by it.",6,7,12,9 January 2011
10 Cloverfield Lane," Superb Cloverfield Spin off
","10 Cloverfield Lane is a tense Horror/Thriller that has you guessing the motives of the characters throughout the film. It's the story of a woman who wakes up in a room underground after a car accident and is told by a farmer that he has saved her from the world outside which he says is uninhabitable . The question is , is he lying and does he have an ulterior motive for keeping her captive? This is a spin off from the 2008 film Cloverfield ( which I loved) but it's hard to say why without giving it away. John Goodman is fantastic as Howard and Mary Elizabeth Winstead is pretty convincing too. Director Dan Trachtenberg did a really good job with this considering it was his debut feature. I really enjoyed this and hopefully we will see more Cloverfield hybrid's in the future.",8,1,4,21 May 2016
Source Code," Thoroughly enjoyable entertainment
","Imagine a film that was a cross between 'Inception' , 'De ja Vu ' and ' Groundhog Day' and you will get Source Code and what a cracking little movie this is.There has been quite dirge of SciFi thrillers in the last 12 months and most have been really good , so Source Code had a lot to live up to and live up to it does.Jake Gyllenhaal plays a helicopter pilot who wakes up to find he is thrust into a situation where he has to find a bomber of a train heading to Chicago. he has 8 minutes to find the bomber but not just the single 8 minutes because somehow he is being thrust back in time to do the job of saving countless lives. Confused ? You wont be when you watch this because this flick moves along a really fast pace from the moment it starts and unlike Inception , you don't finish the film scratching your head wondering what the hell just happened.Gyllenhaal is superb , as is Christina Warren , the only one letting the side down is Jeffrey Wright , who plays Dr. Rutledge . His acting is a bit wooden.I can't recommend Source Code highly enough. It's ninety minutes of pure entertainment.",9,0,1,23 June 2011
Child 44," An absolute mess.
",Child 44 is the story of an ex member of the Russian military police who investigates a series of child murders during the Stalin-era Soviet Union. I am struggling to think of a bad film that Tom Hardy has made . He is currently flavour of the month and quite rightly so but Child 44 is probably the worst thing he has done but it's not his fault. This film is all over the place. It can't decide whether it is a serial-killer thriller or an old-school anti-Soviet propaganda movie and just ends up failing miserably on both fronts. The editing is disastrous. It feels like a bunch of scenes all put together and not always in the correct order . I honestly thought there had been scenes accidentally deleted at one stage it was so bad and at 137 minutes you can't wait for the end credits to roll. 4 out of 10,4,59,100,30 July 2015
It," Pennywise is back !
","I loved the original IT film/Mini series and the Stephen King book even more so , so it was always going to be hard to live up to expectations especially when my opinion was that a remake was unnecessary but I actually really enjoyed this. 
Director Andy Muschietti tells the story in a different way that the book does. Where in the original it skips between the kids and the adults story this solely concentrates on the kids battle with Pennywise the clown. It does feel a little bit like The Goonies or Stranger Things and for that reason I didn't think it was overly scary but it does have it's moments. 
Bill Skarsgård had massive boots to fill ( excuse the pun) to be as good as Tim Curry's Pennywise and he definitely isn't as scary but he does a good enough job and at no stage was I bored . It's a really good film and I'm looking forward to the adults story in part 2.",8,1,1,18 December 2017
Minority Report," Spielberg hasn't done anything as good since Minority Report.
","I can't believe it's nearly 10 years since i saw Minority Report in the Cinema. A hell of a lot has happened since then but one thing hasn't changed - This is still a cracking action movie.Tom Cruise stars a cop who works for the pre crime unit that have a way , through precog humans , of telling when , where and by whom murders will happen and stopping them before the murder takes place .It's no surprise that this is a Spielberg movie. It has all the hallmarks of one of his highly entertaining action movies and in my opinion he hasn't made a film as good as this since.Great special affects , a very clever plot and some great acting all contribute to a very good movie.",9,0,1,6 December 2011
Training Day," Denzel Washington at the very top of his game
","Every great actor has a defining performance. A performance that they will always be remembered for. De Niero's was Raging Bull , Pacino's was Scarface and Tom Hank's was Forest Gump. I believe Denzel Washington will always be remembered for his role as Detective Alonzo Harris in Training Day. This was the first time we had really seen Washington play a bad guy and you have to say , he took to it like a duck to water.Training Day is one of my favourite movies of all time. Movies don't get much grittier than this one. Director Antoine Fuqua pulls no punches when telling the story of a rookie cop's first day as detective. Ordinarily we would be raving about the brilliant performance of Ethan Hawke as Jake Hoyt but such is the personality and expertise of Denzel Washington , Hawke is overshadowed. The scene in the kitchen when he is left alone with the card playing gang members is a memorable one.This movie is 10 years old now and rarely has there been a film since to compare. Maybe The Departed has come closest.If you have never seen Training Day , do yourself a favour and go out and rent or buy this now. You wont regret it.",10,2,3,30 March 2011
Wind River," The best thing Renner has has done
","Wind River is a film that seemed to pass everyone by when it got it's theatrical release back in September . I'm not sure if that's because it is a Weinstein film and Harvey had a little bit more on his plate than promoting it ?!
It's also won awards for the most overlooked film of 2017 so I fully expect it to be talked about more now it has been released for home viewing. 
It's the story of a ranger who discovers the frozen body of a young Native American woman in an Indian Reservation. She turns out to be the best friend of his teenage daughter, who died a few years earlier under mysterious circumstances. Although the tribal authorities get involved in the investigation, the FBI also sends in rookie agent to investigate.This is the second film in a row I have watched that involves Native Americans dealing with death and the grief that comes with it ( the other was Hostiles ). This is the better film of the two in my opinion.
It's very atmospheric and you really do feel the harshness of the environment these people have to deal with.
This is probably Jeremy Renner's best performance to date as the dad who is still dealing with the death of his daughter but I was not totally convinced that Elizabeth Olsen was the best choice for an FBI agent.
Overall I really liked this and I recommend it if you haven't seen it yet.",8,7,14,20 January 2018
The Big Lebowski," Good but not a classic Dude!
","I first watched The Big Lebowski about 12 years ago and i was extremely underwhelmed by it . I liked it , sure , but i couldn't see what all the fuss was about. Since then i have had a love hate relationship with the Coen Brothers movies. Some of their films i really have not liked such as O Brother, Where Art Thou? and The Ladykillers and recently i have enjoyed the likes of No country for old men and Burn after reading , so i decided to go back and watch The Big Lebowski again and see if , with age , i had become accustomed to their humour and the answer is yes....and no. Jeff Lebowski is the victim of mistaken identity. Two thugs break into his apartment in the errant belief that they are accosting Jeff Lebowski, the Pasadena millionaire--not the laid-back, unemployed, stuck in the 70s Jeff Lebowski who calls himself the Dude. The Dude's first mistake is paying a visit to his wealthy namesake in the hopes of getting a replacement for his soiled carpet. But instead of a Persian loaner, our reluctant hero and his buddy Walter are swept up in a Coenesque comedy/thriller of extortion, double-cross, deception, embezzlement, sex and dope. It takes guys as simple as the Dude and Walter to make a story this complicated...and they'd really rather be bowling. There is no doubt about it that The Big Lebowski has some memorable moments. The characters are fantastic . Jeff Bridges as the Dude , Jon Goodman as Walter Sobchak and John Turturro as Jesus Quintana are the standout performers and they have the best lines in the movie. I love the way Jeff Bridges IS The Dude. He is so perfect in that role that it could have been written for him ( maybe it was?) . Goodman is also outstanding as the wannabe Jew who is highly strung and aggressive and again the role is perfect for him. Now for the problem with the film. The plot. I really feel the story is too weak and at times a little too confusing . I know that's maybe the idea the Coens had when writing this but it does spoil it a little for me. There are times when i felt myself drifting because it was becoming too convoluted. Also the Julianne Moore character seemed unnecessary and became another distraction. The best way to explain the way i feel about The Big Lebowski is that the characters are far too big for what is a pretty lame story and at times they swamp it. I'm glad i went back to watch this movie again but i still feel it's not quite justified in the admiration it still gets.

Star Trek," Brilliant!
","Star Trek 2009 - My Review Category: Movies, TV, Celebrities It has never been cool to like Star Trek. In the past if you declared that you were a fan of the US sci fi franchise , people would laugh and call you a Trekkie nerd , in fact you could declare you was a anorak wearing train spotter and you would come under less criticism ......That is until now! The greatest adventure of all time begins with 'Star Trek,' the incredible story of a young crew's maiden voyage on board the most advanced starship ever created: the U.S.S. Enterprise. On a journey filled with action, comedy and cosmic peril, the new recruits must find a way to stop an evil being whose mission of vengeance threatens all of mankind.The fate of the galaxy rests in the hands of bitter rivals. One, James T. Kirk , is a delinquent, thrill-seeking Iowa farm boy. The other, Spock , was raised in a logic-based society that rejects all emotion. As fiery instinct clashes with calm reason, their unlikely but powerful partnership is the only thing capable of leading their crew through unimaginable danger, boldly going where no one has gone before! I'm not embarrassed to say that I'm a massive fan of Star Trek. I don't dress up as a Klingon in my spare time or go to the conventions. I don't have a room in my house decked out like the bridge aboard the Enterprise and i don't own a pair of Spock ears but i have seen every episode of every TV show that has been spurned by the Gene Roddenberry original series and i have enjoyed them all although , strangely enough the original series was my least favourite of all the different Star Trek shows.( DS9 being my favourite) Star Trek 2009 has done something that none of the other previous movies had managed to do and that is to get non fans talking about Star Trek.J.J Abrams has made a film that has it all . A great story , fantastic special affects and an amazing cast and it's the casting that makes this film the success it has become. Zachary Quinto could be the son of Spock he is so perfect for the role. Relatively unknown Chris Pine is the perfect James Tiberius Kirk. Karl Urban manages to recreate the personality of 'Bones' as if he's never been away and Simon Pegg even has the dodgy Scottish accent that Canadian James Doohan had in the original series. To be honest the story is nothing particularly special , it does not have to be , because what this film is all about is Kirk and .co. I love the frosty relationship between Kirk and Spock and the story of how they come be on the U.S.S Enterprise. Another exciting this is that because of the story the timeline has changed , meaning that everything we know to have happened in the future has now changed opening up whole new possibilities for the future of the federation and exciting new stories. There has always the discussion between fans as to which was the best Star Trek movie over the years ( many have been disappointing) but now that argument has been firmly put to bed. Nothing that had previously been released comes close to being as good as this movie and i only hope that Star Trek 2009 is the shot in the arm that the franchise desperately needed and it spurns a new TV series and more films.Great films are like buses . You wait for ages for one , then two come along together. 10 out of 10",10,1,14,23 May 2009
Citizen Kane," Does not stand the test of time.
","I have no doubt that back in 1941 , Citizen Kane was a ground breaking movie that was loved by millions. The problem is, i watched this for the first time 60 years after it was released and sadly , time , has not done this films any favours whatsoever.The first half of this film really shows a lot of promise. The story starts with the death of Charles Foster Kane and then reverts back to the story of how he inherent his wealth as a boy. Then we see Kane as an enthusiast business man who's sole aim is to be the biggest newspaper mogul around.Up till then the film is fine but the last hour is a bit of a mess. It goes from being a politically motivated movie to a film about one man's self destruction and i was hoping for so much more.Orson Wells is excellent and the ageing process works very well on screen but sadly this film left me cold as old Rosebud.",5,3,8,6 August 2011
Underworld," Entertaining but nothing remarkable
","Lets face it , whats is there not to like about Kate Beckinsale running around in a leather catsuit? OK it might not be everyone's things but Underworld . in its own right is a pretty enjoyable vampire / Werewolf action flick. The first in a sequence of films , that look extremely good and has so much extreme sound it bombards your eardrums. I'm a big fan of Bill Nighy and Michael Sheen and they are both good value for money as Lycan and Vampire respectively. It reminded me a little of the Blade films but maybe not quite a good. My advise would be to not watch the extended version as i did because 2 hours 10 minutes is a little too long to take.",7,1,2,28 January 2011
Green Room," Tinged with sadness.
","Although there is absolutely nothing supernatural about Green Room there is no doubt I'm my mind that this film should come under the horror category. This is a film about a punk rock band who , while down on their luck , get offered a gig in a neo Nazi club deep in the backwoods of Oregon and after witnessing an act of violence backstage things go downhill very quickly. To say Green Room is gory is an understatement. It's full on , and in a good way. This isn't just violent for violence sake it has a structure and some really good acting. Patrick Stewart is unlike anything you have seen him do before and Joe Cole ( Peaky Blinders) is good too but the best performance is tinged with sadness. The lead actor is Anton Yelchin who died last week in real life when he was crushed by his own car. I really enjoyed Green Room and if you don't mind a whole heap of blood then I can highly recommend it.",8,8,20,2 July 2016
The Danish Girl," Alicia Vikander is superb
",Because of the subject matter in The Danish Girl I wasn't sure this was going to be a film that I would particularly like but I need not have have worried because I thought this was a fascinating movie that justified it's plaudits. This is the story of Danish artist Einar Wegener (Eddie Redmayne) who realised that despite being born a man he is really a woman and that woman is called Lile. Although Redmayne will quite obviously get all the praise for his role as Lile but I think the outstanding performance of this film comes from Alicia Vikander who plays his wife. As an actor she is exposed unlike Redmayne who has the make up to hide behind. Instead of being about Lile this film for me is more about the love of his wife who will do anything to make her husband happy. Even if that means losing him. in the process.,8,79,93,14 February 2016
127 Hours," Danny Boyle and James Franco both deserve Oscar's for this.
","Danny Boyle can do no wrong at the moment. He is rapidly becoming one of the world best directors and in the film '127 hours' this only enforces that point of view. It's true that you don't appreciate what you have until you are in a position to lose it and the story of Aron Ralston typifies this . James Franco is magnificent in this virtual one man show. Stuck , with his arm wedged by a rock ,miles from anywhere and having not told his family where he was , he is faced with a terrible decision. Does he die or does he cut his arm off to escape? What i love about this film is the way Danny Boyle manages to get Ralston's thoughts during his delusional moments across to the audience. There is one scene where he sees himself picking up the son he has not had yet and it's very moving. Inevitably , all the talk will be of the scene where he cuts his arm off and while it is horrific it's only a small part of what is a brilliant movie. If James Franco and Danny Boyle do not get nominated for an Oscar for this film it will be a major injustice because this movie is so much better than films like Social Network and Inception. A must see.",10,1,3,20 January 2011
Creed," Stand out performance from Stallone
",I grew up on watching Rocky films and my kids have seen re-runs of them all too . They are an important part of my movie watching history but Creed feels like an end of an era. This is right up there with the best of them. It reminded me a lot of the first two films. Gritty yet still with the over the top boxing action. This is Stallone's best acting performance of the lot though. He really gets back to grass roots with this performance. Michael B. Jordan is excellent too but what was really surprising was the acting from the real life boxers Andre Ward and Tony Bellew. The one strange thing is the Everton connection to the film. Fans at the fight wearing Everton scarfs and singing Everton songs. Strange. I wonder what the American audience thought of it. All in all I enjoyed this as I have done with most of the films.,8,1,5,16 January 2016
The Others," A rare subtle horror,
","The Others is what you would call an old fashioned ghost story. This is a film which leaves more to the imagination and does not rely on any blood , violence or death ( well not really) but more on a clever script and an ingenious twist.Nocole Kidman plays a mother of two children who lives in an old country house and while she awaits her husband from the second world war she recruits three members of staff . All is not what it seems.I really likes this film. Kidman is good as is Fionnula Flanagan who plays the nanny.This is a slow burner that builds up the tension superbly until the viewer starts to put the pieces of the jigsaw together and in the end it becomes really quite scary.If you have not seen The Others before it is well worth a watch.",Null,1,2,30 July 2011
The Hustler," Paul Newman - A Proper movie star !
","The Hustler was one of those movies that I thought I had seen before because the name is so iconic but soon as I started watching it i realised that I hadn't and what a treat this film was !Paul Newman plays Fast Eddie Felsen who hustles in the world of professional pool. Fast Eddie is a young hopeful on his way to challenging Minnesota Fats for his world title. When he starts getting feelings for a woman he gets into a dilemma.Firstly this is not really a film about pool at all . It's about addiction . Be that an addiction to the thrill of winning , an addiction to money or more horribly an addiction to Alcohol.
Newman is fantastic . He's so cool yet he's playing an extremely flawed character so the coolness isn't something the viewer aspires too.Piper Lawrie is fantastic too as the alcoholic girlfriend who is always going to play second fiddle to the hustle and you just know that the relationship isn't going to end well but she is so desperate to be loved she'd do anything for Eddie .One inspiring decision was to make this in black and white . In 1961 most films were now being made in colour and you would think a film involving pool , it would make more sense but it being in black and white makes this much more atmospheric .
As for the actual pool scenes , I'm a pool and snooker player myself and I can always tell if an actor can actually play the game by the way he holds a cue and his hand position and believe me , Paul Newman knew how to play the game !Next step is to watch the follow up The Color of Money and see how that holds up against this film . If it's even half as good I'll be happy .",9,0,0,16 April 2020
Spotlight," Some mis casting going on here
","Spotlight is an interesting film about how the Boston Globe uncovered the cover up by the Catholic church of dozens and dozens of priest who systematically molested children . This subject makes me really angry when I think of what these perverts are gettinggot away with all in the name of religion and I expected Spotlight to heighten my anger but it didn't really. I found this to be a little sterile despite the fact that his had people like Mark Ruffalo , Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams in the cast. Perhaps they were just a little bit too ' Hollywood' to be playing the parts of these reporters because I never really bought into their performances. John Slattery was the best thing in this because I actually believed he was Ben Bradlee Jr. This is another film that surprises me that it got nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards because there are better films than this that missed out.",7,0,1,6 February 2016
Yes Man," Not a patch on the book but not bad
","I'm not the most prolific reader of books. in fact I'm lucky if i get through half a dozen books a year . One of the novels i have read recently is the fantastic Autobiographical ' Yes Man ' written by the extremely talented Londoner Danny Wallace . It's a funny , moving and ingenious book that i found hard to put down . So when i heard it was being made into a film i was thrilled. That was until i found out that it was going to be a Rom Com starring Jim Carey. Carl Allen is a guy whose life is going nowhere—the operative word being 'no'—until he signs up for a self-help program based on one simple covenant: say yes to everything...and anything. Unleashing the power of 'YES' begins to transform Carl's life in amazing and unexpected ways, getting him promoted at work and opening the door to a new romance. But his willingness to embrace every opportunity might just become too much of a good thing. Ten minutes into Yes Man i soon realised that this is very loosely based on the book. In fact it's nothing like it. Sure there are a few moments that happen in the book that are repeated in the film but not many. I'm not a fan of Jim Carey as regular readers of my blog will know. I don't think he's very funny and when he tries straight acting he's even worse. So what I'm about to say may surprise you. I actually quite liked Yes Man! Sure it's not true to the book but once i got my head around that i started to quite enjoy it. Carey is not as annoying as normal and his supporting cast are very good. Zooey Deschanel is delightful as the love interest and 'Flight of Concords ' star Rhys Darby is hilarious. In fact he nearly steals the show from old rubber face himself. It's true that it's a romantic comedy and that's not every one's cup of tea (especially mine) but there are enough distractions to make you forget that. It does lose it's way in the last twenty minutes when it starts to get a bit preachy ( which couldn't be further from the book) but you can forgive it for that.Yes Man isn't the sort of film you need to think about too much. It's a movie that you can just sit back and enjoy....but not too much. There are a couple of really funny scenes. One involves Carl and a role of sticky tape and the other a pensioner who has a special talent when she takes her teeth out. You use your imagination with that one! Having said that there is also an awful scene that made no sense at all involving a man trying to commit suicide and a spontaneous burst of song. Jim Carey has made a whole load of awful films in recent years and fans of his will be asking , Is Jim back? The Answer is........Yes Man! (But i recommend the book more than the film) 7 out of 10",7,1,1,28 April 2009
Midnight in Paris," Woody Allen Zzzzzzzz
","I really don't get the hype with Woody Allen. I really do feel that it's a case of ' The Emperors New Clothes' with his films. Actors and critics alike fall over backwards to praise his work yet i find it all very bland.Midnight in Paris is an odd film about a writer who , while on vacation in Paris with his wife to be, finds a way to go back in time to meet famous artists , writers and musicians and he soon realises that this world is far better than the one he currently lives in.As is any Woody Allen movie , Midnight in Paris is very dialogue orientated , and i have no problem with that but what i don't like is the pretentiousness of it. Allen presumes the audience is aware of the characters on show and their history and that everyone is in love with their work. It's not the case with me. Owen Wilson is irritating ( as usual) as is the totally unbelievable Rachel McAdams. You never get the feeling that these are a real couple. This film is not terrible , just boring and that really is not a trait i want in a film",5,11,19,23 January 2012
Youth," A wonderful movie
","To say that Youth is a little odd would be a bit of an understatement. But not odd in a bad way , odd in a very , very good way. I absolutely loved this film. This is the story of a retired orchestra conductor ( Michael Caine) on holiday in a lavish retreat with his daughter and his film director best friend ( Harvey Keitel) in the Alps when he receives an invitation from the Queen to perform for Prince Philip's birthday. In all honesty this isn't really about the invitation , it's about getting old and how you reflect on life so differently than when you are younger. This looks fantastic . Sure it can be classed as a bit arty but director Paolo Sorrentino hasn't gone over the top with it instead he has got Michael Caine , to produce one of the best screen performance I have ever seen him perform. There are a few surreal moments that don't quite fit , like the cameo from Paloma Faith which seems to have been shoehorned into the film just to get her on screen but on the other hand I loved the scene with a fat Diego Maradona doing keepy uppies with a tennis ball. This won't be everyone's bag but it got me big time.",9,2,4,8 February 2016
Zodiac," Fincher plays games with his audience again
","There is no doubting David Fincher is one of the greatest directors of the last 30 years . His attention to detail is astonishing and you almost have to watch his films several times to take everything in .Zodiac is no different .Set in the late 1960s and 1970 , San Francisco is in fear as a serial killer called Zodiac stalks its residents. Investigators and reporters become obsessed with learning the killer's identity and bringing him to justice.Fincher loves to lead the audience down the garden path. Just when you think you know what's happening and who's the culprit is , he throws in a curve ball .Zodiac really makes it's audience work. You feel as frustrated as the detectives and reporters looking for the killer and as Fincher likes to do , the ending isn't all sweetness and light . who can forget Se7en!There are some great performances from Jake Gyllenhaal and Mark Ruffalo but you can't help but think that inspector David Toschi should have had his man locked up if he's have really done his job properly.If you like this , I recommend the Netflix series Manhunter . It's very similar and is also directed by David Fincher .",9,2,2,1 July 2020
Milk," Great acting but not a great film.
","Up until a few months ago i had never heard of the Name Harvey Milk. There is no reason why i should have done really and it's only the release of this film that had brought his name to my attention. To be honest a movie with this subject matter would not be first on my list but being a big fan of Sean Penn and Josh Brolin and it being nominated for eight Oscars i had to see what all the fuss was about.From the acclaimed director Gus Van Sant comes the powerful and inspiring story of California's first openly gay elected official, Harvey Milk. With a powerhouse performance in the leading role, Sean Penn and supporting cast Emile Hirsch , Josh Brolin and James Franco bring this unforgettable story to the big screen.In 1977, Harvey Milk was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, becoming the first openly gay man to be voted into major public office in America. His victory was not just a victory for gay rights; he forged coalitions across the political spectrum. From senior citizens to union workers, Harvey Milk changed the very nature of what it means to be a fighter for human rights and became, before his untimely death in 1978..Apparently there were many actors lined up over the years to play the role of Harvey Milk. Robin Williams , Richard Gere , Daniel Day-Lewis and James Woods. I can see Daniel Day-Lewis in the role but can you imagine any of the others? Sean Penn IS Harvey Milk and without him in the lead role i couldn't imagine this film even getting even a mention in the build up to next months academy awards. It would have been easy to cast openly gay actors in the lead roles in this film and i think it's because director Gus Van Sant didn't , that gives this film more gravitas. I did feel a little uncomfortable watching some of the more intimate scenes involving Sean Penn and James Franco so i can only imagine how hard it was for these two actors to perform the scenes.Of all the nominations Milk has received it's the acting ones that it deserves most. Sean Penn is stunning and it's the acting in this film will remain with me , not the film itself. As a film , Milk is OK . It's not as good as i would have hoped considering the publicity it has received. I would have loved to have learned more about Dan White. Josh Brolin is not on screen enough for me but when he is , he was fantastic. I would have like the director to have delved into the mind of Harvey Milk's assassin and maybe the assassination itself given some more scenes.I loved the old newsreel clips that were shown and it's amazing how the word ' Homosexuals' can be made to sound so dirty and poisonous by the prehistoric news readers!I have seen two of the films nominated for best picture so far and without doubt Slumdog Millionaire is the better film but the acting in Milk is vastly superior .I will be reviewing the other nominated film's in the next couple of weeks. 7 out of 10",7,2,9,31 January 2009
Cloverfield," Pure Sci- fi Joy.
","The Cloverfield Paradox is the third film of this series . All three are very loosely linked and all three are very different films. I absolutely loved the 2008 Cloverfield film. It was a film that used found footage special affects really well before it became old hat but this is not that kind of movie. This is pure Sci-Fi and I loved it.In the near future, scientists aboard a space station are attempting to aid the Earth's energy crisis. Energy is depleting at an alarming rate, leading scientists to turn to a new source but the crew inside of it notice some serious side effects as the energy source causes them to collide with another dimension .Like the previous films there was a lot of secrecy as to what this film was about. In fact critics only got to see it when it was released on Netflix on Sunday after the Superbowl. 
I predict that lot's of people are going to hate this film. Sci Fi fans can be a funny lot and the cross over of genres won't please everyone.
Sure , it's a bit silly at times but I love the way it tied up why ( or how) the aliens invaded the earth. 
It looks great and at no stage did I not feel thoroughly entertained.
Produced by J.J Abrahams , The Cloverfield Paradox is now available on Netflix.",8,2,3,6 February 2018
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Unforgivably boring
","I never got to see the original BBC series that this film originates from , although i do remember when it was on. I was a little too young on the 70's to watch it . This film brilliantly replicates the seventies look and has some superb acting from the cream of the British acting fraternity so it begs the question - Why was this film so boring ?This is the story of a group of British diplomats who find they have a mole amongst them. The cold war with Russia is at it's height and nobody on either side can be trusted.Gary Oldman has been nominated for an Oscar for his role as George Smiley and he is really good as are a few others but unsurprisingly Tinker , Tailor , Soldier , Spy , the film , hasn't been nominated. This film really is slow. Don't get me wrong . it's definitely watchable because of the acting but the story is a complete non event. There is no tension , there is no excitement , there is no ooommph in the film.I've heard reviewers say that this is not a film about spy's but a film about trust and to some extent that is true but there is no cranked up tension whatsoever for the audience to feel any emotion about the characters. By the end of the film i couldn't care less who the mole was.TTSS is a big disappointment.",6,4,7,3 February 2012
The Hateful Eight," Brilliant
","I'm not one of these people who can watch a film over and over again in a short space of time. Once I've seen a film that's it . That is unless it's a Quentin Tarantino film. I can watch them over and over and after seeing this I'm going to watch it again next week. The best way to describe this is that it's Reservoir Dogs meets Django. It starts relatively slowly with Kurt Russell , Jennifer Jason Leigh and Sam Jackson laying down the foundations of the story while taking a horse and carriage ride in the snow but when they get to the infamous , Minnie's Haberdashery , the fun really begins. There are some great performances , especially from Jennifer Jason Leigh and Sam Jackson and there is plenty of Tarantino dialogue to last the three hours , not to mention the blood and gore. It's not the best film of his , for me that still goes to Pulp Fiction but this is up there with Inglorious Bastards , Django Unchained and Reservoir Dogs. Enjoy",9,21,47,9 January 2016
The Adventures of Tintin," Amazing animation
","It's school holiday time and I wasn't particularly looking forward to another kids film at the cinema. Tin Tin looked liked the best of a bad bunch of the choice of movies on but I couldn't be more wrong. This was a belter of a film.Directed by Steven Spielberg , The Adventures of Tin Tin is the exciting story about three antique model ships and their link with lost treasure . The animation is amazing , maybe the best I have ever seen and I didn't even see it in 3D. It's funny and has non stop action. One scene in particular when Tin Tin is chasing an eagle through a town is fantastic .If your stuck for something to do this week , you won't go far wrong by taking them to see this brilliant animation.",Null,2,8,24 October 2011
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spiderman for the modern age
","I really didn't fancy going to see Spider-Man: Homecoming but with there being no football at the moment and my youngest pestering me to go , I succumbed . I haven't really been into Spider-Man since the cartoon TV show of the seventies and with all the changes of lead actors I wasn't holding out great hope but I was pleasantly surprised. Thrilled by his experience with the Avengers, Peter Parker returns home under the watchful eye of his new mentor Tony Stark . Parker tries to fall back into his normal daily routine—distracted by thoughts of proving himself to be more than just your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man—but when the Vulture (Michael Keaton) emerges as a new villain, he finds that there is a massive conflict between his Spidey life and his private life. Tom Holland is excellent as the new Spider-Man. He's playing a 15 year old Peter Parker and that will definitely appeal to the kids. In fact the whole film feels like it's aimed at the younger market. There is less death and destruction than a usual Avengers movie ( and this IS an Avengers movie) and more references to what teenagers are into. Some of the special affects are amazing especially one scene where Spider-Man climbs up the Washington Monument ( great in 3D) also a scene on a ferry. It could do with half an hour being shaved off of it but I think that of most Marvel films . Not Bad at all.",7,0,5,8 July 2017
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," George C Scott steals the show
","There have been a lot funnier Peter Sellers films in the past but i doubt there has been a more iconic one than Dr Strangelove. You forget how obsessive people used to be about the nuclear arms race and this film is a delightful , tongue in cheek look at look at what could happen is something goes wrong. It looks very fresh , even though it is black and white and the dialogue is very funny but not is a rolling around on the floor kind of way. Although the lead actor is Peter Sellers ( he plays three parts) the man who steals the show is George C Scott who plays the war mongering commie hating general. The scenes in the Aeroplane that is on course to drop the bomb is very interesting and i love the bit where the pilot rides the bomb. If you have not seen this before i recommend you get hold of it.",8,2,6,19 January 2011
The Way Back," Dull , Dull , Dull.
","The way back had all the ingredients to be one of those films that amazes and moves you. A story about a group of people who are fighting for survival against all the odds , usually the kind of film i really like but for some reason this left me as cold as the Himalayas they were crossing.I should have like this film . It has some good actors in it such as Jim Sturgess , Colin Farrell and Ed Harris but even they couldn't improve on what was ultimately a bad piece of direction.Peter Weir should know better. He has made some good films in the past like , Master and Commander and Dead Poets Society but for some reason , before this film , he took a 6 year break from directing and it shows.The scenes look like they were thrown together . without any thought and the characters were so dull you really didn't care what happened to them Why didn't we see any locals trying to take advantage of the rewards for the convicts ? It was hinted that would be the case but it didn't happen. The Way Back is not terrible it's just dull and that's not what you want when you are watching a film that is 2 hours and 12 minutes long.",5,22,42,22 June 2011
Horrible Bosses," Lucikly it's not spoilt by a major plot flaw
","Ever hated your job so much that you wanted to kill your boss? I'm gonna refrain from answering that question myself but Horrible Bosses is the comic tale of three men who hate their bosses so much they plot to kill them , together. One boss (Colin Farrell) is a coke head who has taken over the business from his late father , another is a controlling boss (Kevin Spacey) who promises everything and delivers nothing and the third is a sex maniac (Jennifer Aniston) who is out to seduce her assistant at every moment. There is one massive flaw in this film and you've probably already realised what it is. How on earth is the third a horrible boss?? The other two bosses are extremely horrible and the third is every man's dream! Apart from this obvious plot flaw , Horrible Bosses is a lot of fun. Jason Bateman , Jason Sudeikes and Charlie Day all work well together and although the story does get a little fascicle ( as you would expect) it's still and above average comedy. Jamie Foxx has a very funny cameo role as 'Motherfucker' Jones and i would have likes to have seen more of him.All in all i was pleasantly surprised with Horrible Bosses and it might just have given me a few ideas.......",Null,1,2,6 October 2011
The Town," Scandalous that this wasn't nominated for Best Film
","Sometime you have to wonder what the Academy are thinking when they announce the nominations for the Oscars. It's annoying when extremely average films like The Social Network and Winters Bone get nominated for best film yet the likes of The Town gets ignored. Ben Affleck has flattered to deceive in recent years with his directing and acting but i believe in future years , this film , will be seen as one of his greatest achievements. The Town is a good old fashioned Heist/Bank Robbery movie that is multi layered to the extent that you cant tank your eyes off the action. It takes me back to films like ' The French Connection' , High adrenaline action films that rely on absolutely no CGI but great action and top notch acting. Having said that wasn't convinced by the performance of Jon Hamm who seemed to be clean shaven one minute yet growing a beard in the next. I watched the two and a half hour extended version and it still didn't drag. The Town is the the film that the 2010 Oscars forgot.

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Put this on a Billboard - 'YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM'.
","If you are a movie fan this is the best time of year. It's awards season and all the best films are around so you can check out if the hype is justified. Three Billboards has been talked highly amongst the critics and in my opinion quite rightly so. It's the best film I have seen in quite a while.It's the story of a grieving mother who takes matters into her own hands as she searches for her daughter's murderer. An angry Mildred Hayes erects three provocative highway signs to catch the eye of the town's well liked Chief of Police Bill Willoughby. Hoping the billboards spur Willoughby's officer Dixon into action but all it does is ignites a storm in the community as the police force evades charges of racism and corruption.Sam Rockwell is an underrated actor. He's done some fantastic work in recent years .I'm not sure why he doesn't get bigger roles.
There is no denying Frances McDormand ability too ( who can forget Fargo?). These two actors are absolutely fantastic in this film and I hope they both win in their respective categories . 
This film has everything. It's funny , it's sad , it can make you angry and it can makes you cry. 
Martin McDonagh has made a film that will live long in the memory and if there is a better film nominated at this years Academy Awards I can't wait to see it.",9,2,5,25 January 2018
American Sniper," Clouded by Stars and Stripes
","I understand that Chris Kyle is a hero in the eyes of the American people and he did do an important job but this film goes way over the top . In fact i wouldn't have been surprised if this had started with the commonly seen cartoon Marvel introduction , it's that sycophantic and it's no coincidence that this directed by Clint Eastwood. Bradley Copper does a decent enough job , as does Sienna Miller and it does entertain if you can see through the stars and stripes. It's a shame that Eastwood didn't make this more of anti war movie because then this film could have worked but sadly this is just a pro American film made for Americans.",6,8,36,11 January 2015
Fargo," It's all about the Characters
","When i first saw Fargo a few years ago i wasn't as convinced , as most , of how good this film was. Since then , The Coen Brothers films have grown on me. After watching this again it has certainly gone up in my estimation although i still think it's far from perfect. Without a doubt , the best thing about Fargo is the characters . William H Macey , Steve Buscemi and especially Frances McDormand make Fargo the interesting film that it is. I love the way Marge Gunderson acts as if she's so slow , yet it's just the way people are in that part of the country and in fact she's far from stupid. William H Macey plays a man so caught up in debt that he tries to have he's wife kidnapped so he can share the ransom and needless to say things go wrong very quickly. He's perfect for the role of a man in trouble as he is in one of favourite films , Boogie Nights. This is not the best Coen Brothers movie but it certainly a memorable one and it's a film i appreciate a whole lot more than i did when i first saw it.",9,0,1,21 March 2011
Burn After Reading," The best Coen brothers comedy
","I have never really bought into Coen Brothers comedy ethos. Apart from 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' which i hated , i have quite enjoyed their films but i have never found them funny. The humour seems to wash over me , so i wasn't holding out a great deal of hope for 'Burn after Reading' . It just goes to show how wrong i can be !Osbourne Cox is a low level analyst at the CIA, after leaving his job he decides he will use whatever knowledge he has gained within his long years at the CIA to publish a tell-all memoir, Osbourne starts writing every juicy tidbit of information he can come up with, on his home computer. Unbeknownst to him, his wife's divorce lawyer advised her to make a copy of his hard drive's contents on to a CD, should he be withholding personal financials.Through an odd turn of events, said disk ends up being accidentally left in a local gym by the divorce lawyer's receptionist, and ends up in the hands of two scheming idiot employees at the Hardbodies Gym, Chad and Linda . Believing they hold some valuable secret information, the two attempt to blackmail Cox into paying them money to live their ambitious life plans.Characters are what the Coens do best. Whether it be The Dude in 'The Big Lebowski' or Jerry Lundegaard in 'Fargo' or even Anton in 'No Country For Old Men'. In 'Burn after reading' we are spoilt with fantastic characters.Brad Pitt is superb as the slightly camp gym instructor Chad Feldheimer. I loved his phone conversation with Osbourne Cox when he informs him that he has his computer disc.The anger that comes from Cox and the surprise from Chas is brilliant. Pitt seems to put everything into this role and thoroughly deserves his BAFTA nomination for best supporting actor.George Clooney is also great. He plays a paranoid sexual deviant that uses women for his own pleasure. His scenes with Frances McDormand ( Linda) are very enjoyable. especially the moment he shows her his new sex machine that he has made in his basement. The conversation goes something like this..Linda:What is it? Harry : What is it? Harry : You sit down there, make yourself comfortable, put your feet in the stirrups, and... Linda : Oh my God. Linda :That's fantastic.!The film is packed with conversation like this and i hate to admit it , i laughed my socks of throughout !John Malkovich (Osbourne Cox) and J.K. Simmons ( The CIA Superior) deserve a lot of credit for their dark comedy acting also. This is by far the best comedy the Coen brothers have done and even makes me think that i should go back and watch their back catalogue to see if i have missed something the first time round and if i have , in the words of the CIA Superior ' What a Clusterf''k!'.8 out of 10",8,1,3,17 January 2009
Baby Driver," Soundtrack is the star
","I was reluctant to watch Baby Driver because a friend of mine described this as a musical and i run a mile from musicals. Thankfully , although it's rammed pack full of music , it's definitely not a musical in my opinion. This is the story of a getaway driver called Baby who because of tinnitus , lives his life with his headphones in and a constant soundtrack playing . He meets a girl in a diner and he sees it as his chance to get out of the crime game. I can see why my friend thought this was a musical because in places it's choreographed like one but thankfully the music comes from a brilliant soundtrack and not spontaneous singing. I actually think that the music is so good it becomes the star of this film and not the actors. The story is OK , it starts really well but is unable maintain the adrenaline filled first twenty minutes and gets baggier the longer the film goes on. It's a brave film to make from Edgar Wright and for the most part it works and i'm all for more films with brilliant soundtracks. Guardians of the Galaxy aside they seem few and far between nowadays.",7,2,5,26 September 2017
The Color of Money," Cruise is way over the txop.
","I was excited to see The Color of Money a couple of days after I watched The Hustler (1961) which is where we first meet Eddie Felson but did it live up to expectations?Fast Eddie Felson decides he wants to return to the game by taking a pupil. He meets talented but green Vincent Lauria and proposes a partnership. As they tour pool halls, Eddie teaches Vincent the tricks of scamming, but he eventually grows frustrated with Vincent's showboat antics, leading to an argument and a falling-out. Eddie takes up playing again and soon crosses paths with Vincent as an opponent.The first surprise was that this was directed by Martin Scorsese . When you Hear people talk about his work , this is rarely, if ever , mentioned . Some critics didn't like it either but as far as awards go , it did really well .On the whole I liked it . Unlike The Hustler this is far more about the pool than anything else .
Paul Newman is great and is the glue that holds this film together.
Tom Cruise not so much .
Cruise is playing a rookie pool player and he feels like a rookie actor in this. He's fine in the quieter scenes but when he's being the pool player he really does over ham the acting .
If he acted like that in real pool halls in the US ( or here in the UK) he'd more often than not find himself in deep trouble.Another downside is that this has that mid 1980's look about it . Movies didn't look great in that decade and this is no exception.The story is uncomplicated and I thought it might be sad to see Eddie 25 years older but it really wasn't . He really was back!Newman won best actor Oscar for this and many said it was a sympathy win because he'd missed out in so many great films and that maybe so but he is head and shoulders the best thing about The Color Of Money .",8,0,0,16 April 2020
The Revenant," Should win best picture and rightly so.
","I've now seen all the films nominated for this years best picture Oscar bar one ( Spotlight ) and without a doubt , in my mind , The Revenant is the best of the lot . True , it's not a vintage year but this does have the feel of a film that will stand the test of time. Leonardo DiCaprio play Glass , a frontiersman who fights for survival after being mauled by a bear and left for dead by members of his own hunting team , one of whom is particularly nasty , played by Tom Hardy. This is a classic survival/ revenge movie that looks fantastic ( especially the bear fight ) and despite being over two and a half hours , never flounders and that's mainly thanks to a career defining performance from DiCaprio. This looked like a really tough film to make because of the conditions and the physical transformation needed but Mexican director Alejandro González Iñárritu did a fantastic job.",9,0,1,29 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," Enjoyable but not a classic.
","Bridge of Spies has the feel an old fashioned drama and has all the hallmarks of a Steven Spielberg film. The attention to detail , the charismatic leading man ( Hanks ) and the sentimentality . There's nothing not to like about this film but is that enough to make it great ? Probably not. Although Tom Hanks is excellent I think the standout performance is from Mark Rylance who plays the Russian spy , Rudolf Abel . His understated dour acting is brilliant to watch. If you are expecting an action thriller then you will be disappointed. It's not that type of film. This is pure drama and an enjoyable one at that. I'm not convinced this is the classic some people are talking about.",7,0,1,26 December 2015
North by Northwest," Cary Grant is so unconvincing.
","Considering the amount of films i have seen over the years , i don't think i have come across a Cary Grant movie. A name I'm fully aware of but does he live up to the Hollywood superstar status he had back in the 40's & 50's ? Not on this performance. I was really disappointed with this , especially because it was a Alfred Hitchcock film. At times i was confused by the plot and at others i was just bored. Cary Grant's acting seemed wooden and the relationship with Eva Marie Saint was never convincing. The loves scenes were very cold and the 27 year age gap seemed very apparent. Plus points are that some of the scenes looked great , especially the aeroplane one and the performances of Mason and Landau are pretty good.

Warrior," Entertaining but predictable.
","There is no doubting that one of the up and coming British actors around is Tom Hardy. His performances always seem really intense as anybody who has seen Bronson will agree and nothing changes in Warrior . He is fantastic , yet the film isn't all it's cracked up to be.Warrior is about two brothers who are down on their luck ( what a surprise!) who enter a mixed martial arts tournament to win five million dollars. Their father is an alcoholic who wants their forgiveness but forgiveness isn't in large supply. The big problem i have with Warrior is the sport involved - Mixed martial arts. It's just not very good. It lacks the excitement of boxing and because its supposedly no holds barred you never really know what's going on.Tom Hardy is brilliant as is Joel Edgerton but a special mention must go to a forgotten actor in Nick Nolte. He's looking very old yet he hasn't lost it.Warrior is entertaining but it's also extremely predictable and full of clichÃ©s but i'm sure most people will enjoy i for what it is.",7,5,11,4 January 2012

","On paper this movie had all the hallmarks of being a good watch. A promising story that had a great deal of potential and a cast of really good actors ( Ewan Mcgregor being the exception ). So why was this so dull? Simply put , the screenplay stunk. It wasn't funny , the story wasn't gripping enough and you even got the impression the cast didn't believe in it either. It does not help having one of the most overrated actors in Hollywood playing the lead role. He should have gave up after Trainspotting because he's done nothing good to speak of since. It's not without it's moments but they are too few and far between and to sum up i was completely underwhelmed. If your thinking of watching get yourself a goat instead and , well , stare at it .

Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Thoroughly enjoyable
",Today was another school holidays trip to the IMAX and i have to say i wasn't expecting too much but i think i came away enjoying this more than the kids ! Number five in the Mission Impossible franchise plays out much more like Bond film . The plot involves espionage with the CIA and the British secret service and the predictable bad guy/woman rogue agents and although it's quite a convoluted plot it never got too difficult to understand. The action is superb especially an amazing bike chase that takes you're breath away. I found this thoroughly enjoyable and a great way to spend a rainy afternoon with the kids.

Dunkirk," Not quite the masterpiece but still bloody good.
","Rarely has there been a film in recent years as wildly anticipated as Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk. Even since it's screening for the critics at the beginning of the week the reviews have been off the scale. One I read even called it 'perfection' . Do I agree ? well no - but as films go I bet you will be hard pushed to see anything as good as this in 2017. This is the story about the Dunkirk evacuation during the early days of World War II. When 400,000 British and Allied troops end up trapped on the beaches of Dunkirk, France . It loosely follows three stories. One a group of young soldiers who are trying to escape Dunkirk. The other a family who are going out to rescue them on their family boat and finally squadron RAF Spitfire Pilots. I have to say this took me a little while to get into. There is very little , if any , full blown conversations between the characters in this film which also means you get no background information on them which I would have liked. Nolan gets the audience straight into the thick of things with breath taking set pieces backed up by explosions with bullets flying around your head, This is all backed up by a hypnotic soundtrack which I have to say got a little headachy after a while. Because of this cacophony of noise I found it hard to adjust when there was dialogue or perhaps that's just me? It wouldn't be a Christopher Nolan film without him trying to confuse the audience and this time it comes with the out of sync timeline. I wouldn't know Harry Styles if he delivered my post but for a pop star he is superb in this. Probably the standout actor. Overall this is a really good film but maybe not the masterpiece we had been promised but I am a lover of historical movies and I have to say this is right up there with the best world war II films .",9,1,6,21 July 2017
Bad Teacher," Bad Teacher = Bad Experience
","Elizabeth is a teacher after one thing - to meet a wealthy man and get out of teaching. The trouble is she thinks most men want a woman with big boobs so her only option raise enough money to get surgery and she really doesn't care how far she goes to get the cash. Bad Teacher isn't totally devoid of laughs but it certainly does not have enough for it to be classed as funny. The strange thing is that that the star of the film does not have any funny lines at all. The best jokes go to Jason Segal , Phyllis Smith and Lucy Punch and you have to wonder why Cameron Diaz took this part or even if she read the script.Justin Timberlake continues to impress as an actor and he is really good as the wealthy geek that Elizabeth is chasing but it's still not enough to make this film work on any level.At times it's extremely silly and the people who made this film must have been hoping it's audience were idiots to buy into the premise.Bad Teacher = Bad Experience",Null,4,9,13 July 2011

","In my quest to watch all the films in the IMDb.com top 500 films of all time , i came across number 47 in Spirited Away and after struggling through this animated film i cant help but think it's position is an error. This is one of those horrible Manga type movies that that depicts people with massive eyes and a tiny nose and they looks terrible. The backing animation is good , as is the soundtrack , but the story is mind bendingly bad. The whole movie is like one big acid trip and i really would be weary about showing this to a young child. It's over two hours long and extremely hard to get through. All i can think is that everyone in Japan voted for this film because i really cannot see any appeal in this film and it's a travesty it's anywhere near this list.",1,8,27,27 July 2011
Tropic Thunder," Worth watching for Robert Downey Jr alone
","It seems to me that nearly every other comedy at the moment is a sex comedy that is either produced or written by Judd Apatow or it stars Seth Rogen . I don't have too much of a problem with that as they all tend to be quite funny but for how long? Luckily Tropic Thunder bucks that trend and we have a comedy that is not only different but is very funny too.Ben Stiller plays pampered action superstar Tugg Speedman, who is cast in the biggest, most expensive war movie ever produced. He sets out to Southeast Asia with a 'Who's Who' of celebrity co-stars. They include Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.), an intense, three-time Oscar(R)-winning actor; Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black), star of the popular gross-out comedy franchise 'The Fatties'; multi-platinum hip-hop-star-turned-entrepreneur-turned-actor Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson); and first-timer Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel). Soon after the production begins the actors are thrown into a real-life situation and are forced to become the fighting unit they're portraying, in order to find a way out of the jungle in one piece.Is there a more versatile actor around at the moment that Robert Downey Jr.? If there is i cant think of one. Despite his well publicised problems in the past he has come back with a vengeance and the diversity of rolls he picks has to be admired . From Chaplin to Iron man everything he does seems to work , but he has outdone himself here as the Australian method actor Kirk Lazarus who has a skin pigment operation to turn himself into an African American so as to immerse himself into the role He is quite Brilliant and makes this film worth watching on its own.Apparently he had some reservations about taking the part in case it would offend. I'm so glad he decided to do it.As Kirk Lazarus says 'I know what dude I am. I'm the dude playin' the dude, disguised as another dude! ' There are also some superb comic performances from Tom Cruise and Ben Stiller . You have to check out the final credits when Cruise's Character , Les Grossman , is dancing to gangster rap , Priceless.Basically this movie is one big micky take out of Hollywood and it's actors and i admire Director Ben Stiller and the cast for going along with that.I really enjoyed Tropic Thunder and although it does get a little silly at times the brilliant script and the first class comic acting make this a film not to be missed.8 out of 10",8,3,6,13 November 2008
Quantum of Solace," A little disappointing
","I first came across Daniel Craig in the brilliant BBC TV series - Our friends in the north - back in 1996 . It was obvious to anyone that Craig had the potential to go on to be a big star and what bigger role than to play Bond . Despite questions of 'Craig who? from across the pond , he was a huge success in arguably the best Bond movie for 25 years in -Casino Royale , but the burning question was 'could the strangely named follow up - Quantum of Solace - live up to it's predecessor? Sadly, in my opinion , the answer is no. Betrayed by Vesper, the woman he loved, 007 fights the urge to make his latest mission personal. Pursuing his determination to uncover the truth, Bond and M interrogate Mr White who reveals the organisation which blackmailed Vesper is far more complex and dangerous than anyone had imagined.Forensic intelligence links an Mi6 traitor to a bank account in Haiti where a case of mistaken identity introduces Bond to the beautiful but feisty Camille , a woman who has her own vendetta. Camille leads Bond straight to Dominic Greene, a ruthless business man and major force within the mysterious organisation.On a mission that leads him to Austria, Italy and South America, Bond discovers that Greene, conspiring to take total control of one of the world's most important natural resources, is forging a deal with the exiled General Medrano . Using his associates in the organisation, and manipulating his powerful contacts within the CIA and the British government, Greene promises to overthrow the existing regime in a Latin American country, giving the General control of the country in exchange for a seemingly barren piece of land.In a minefield of treachery, murder and deceit, Bond allies with old friends in a battle to uncover the truth. As he gets closer to finding the man responsible for the betrayal of Vesper, 007 must keep one step ahead of the CIA, the terrorists and even M, to unravel Greene's sinister plan and stop his organisation. In my opinion there are five main ingredients you need to make a great Bond film. Great action , a good Bond , a gripping story ,a memorable bad guy and a rousing theme song. The problem with Quantum of Solace is , is that it falls short on the last three. The action is exactly what you would expect . Brilliant car chases , plenty of punch ups and a this time a rebellious Bond has no qualms in Killing everyone and anyone who stand in his way . The problem is , great action scenes are not enough . The story is a bit wayward and Bond's enemies are just not interesting enough . You need to be able to hate the bad guys to feel part of the story , but i didn't. Also what were they thinking when they agreed to have that dreadful song by Jack White and Alicia Keys? They are both out of tune!!!Don't get me wrong Quantum of Solace is not a bad movie , it's actually quite good, but i want my Bond movies to be great. Perhaps the bar was set too high with Casino Royale?I also got the impression that director Marc Foster ( who incidentally made my film of the year so far in 'the Kite Runner') was trying to make a film that looked like The Bourne Ultimatum . lots of quick , short , difficult to take, in fight scenes but this is no Bourne Ultimatum. This isn't even Daniel Craig's best movie this year , that goes to the fantastic ' Flashbacks of a Fool'. To sum up , Quantum of Solace is a fairly good action movie that is hard to dislike but i expected so much more.7 out of 10",7,3,6,31 October 2008
Twilight," Surprisingly good!
","When Twilight was released last year i made a point of avoiding it. The marketing leading up to it being released seemed solely aimed at teenagers girls and that demographic could not be further away from me. So after all the hype had died down i decided to see what all the kids were getting so excited about and do you know what? I loved it! Bella Swan has always been a little bit different, never caring about fitting in with the trendy girls at her Phoenix high school. When her mother remarries and sends Bella to live with her father in the rainy little town of Forks, Washington, she doesn't expect much of anything to change. Then she meets the mysterious and dazzlingly beautiful Edward Cullen , a boy unlike any she's ever met. Intelligent and witty, he sees straight into her soul. Soon, Bella and Edward are swept up in a passionate and decidedly unorthodox romance. Edward can run faster than a mountain lion, he can stop a moving car with his bare hands — and he hasn't aged since 1918. Like all vampires, he's immortal. But he doesn't have fangs, and he doesn't drink human blood; Edward and his family are unique among vampires in their lifestyle choice. To Edward, Bella is that thing he has waited 90 years for — a soul mate. But the closer they get, the more Edward must struggle to resist the primal pull of her scent, which could send him into an uncontrollable frenzy. But what will Edward and Bella do when James , Laurent and Victoria , the Cullens' mortal vampire enemies, come to town, looking for her? I'm not familiar with the books written Stephenie Meyer so apart from knowing this was a vampire/love story i didn't really know what to expect from this film. Firstly let me say that visually , Twilight is stunning. The subtle colours and special affects are fantastic. Director Catherine Hardwicke understanding that 'less is more' makes this film a delight to watch. They could so easily have got a Michale Bay style director to make this film and thank god they didn't. It's the first time i have come across Robert Pattinson who plays Edward Cullen . I was very impressed with his screen presence and I'm looking forward to seeing future projects from him. Kristen Stewart is good too , although the performance from Pattinson overshadows hers by some margin.I loved the way the relationship between the two develops and the fact that he's want desperately for her to stay human and live a normal,fulfilling life , makes this different from other vampire movies. The only criticism i have of Twilight is over the top School Kids. Every one apart from Bella and Edward are so Happy , and nice and over excited that they look like they have walked of the set of a new sickly modern Brady Bunch.I never remembered school being like that.Twilight was a pleasant surprise and delight to watch yet it's still not the best Vampire film i have seen this year and that goes to ' let the right one in',although this does have quite a few of the same qualities as that film. This film cost 37 million Dollars to make and took in 351 million Dollars at the box office. Twilight is already a phenomenon.I can't wait for the next film ' New Moon' and this time i wont wait so long to see it.8 out of 10",8,1,4,8 June 2009
Bridesmaids," One of the funniest films i have seen in a while
","I wasn't sure what to expect from Bridesmaids. An all female comedy is the kind of film that would not normally appeal to me but thankfully Bridesmaids turned out to be on of the funniest films i have seen in the past 12 months.The story revolves around Annie , who's life seems to be passing her by while her best friend , Lillian is getting married . Although Annie is a lifelong friend of Lillian ,a new friend Helen has come along and has decided to plan the wedding to the horror of Annie.If you thought the first Hangover film was funny then let me tell you , this was much funnier. Some of the scenes had me laughing out loud and the one where they get food poisoning in the wedding dress shop had me in tears.Kirsten Wiig is brilliant in the lead role and she really shows what a talented comedienne she is. There are some cameo rolls from Matt Lucas and Chris O'Dowd that are impressive too.Highly recommended.",Null,1,3,9 September 2011
The Pianist," Brody is great - The film , not so great
","There have been may great films about the the terrible way the Jewish population were treated by the Germans during World War II . Some great , some not so great. The Pianist is a critically acclaimed movie from 2002 that i had been looking forward to seeing for a while but i couldn't help but be a little disappointed with it. The best thing about this film , without a doubt , is the performance of Adrien Brody . It is a film that lacks the fee of a feature film. It looks much more like a TV film and a long one at that. I'm not a big fan of Maureen Lipman and with actors like her that makes it look even more less like a big movie. There are other things that don't ring true in the film. In the Jewish Ghetto the people were just walking past dead children without even looking or moving them and i don't care how bad things are you wouldn't ignore a dead or dying child. Also there is a scene where Szpilman is shot at when he comes out of building in a German coat but it's blindingly obvious that he was a Jewish survivor and it wouldn't happen. The Piano may have touched a nerve with a lot of people but it didn't do a great deal for me - having said that, it's still a 7 out of 10 movie.",7,1,5,15 March 2011
Foxcatcher," Carell is fantastic as Du Ponte
","It's best if you know nothing about John E. du Pont or the Schultz brothers when going to see Foxcatcher. This whole story was new to me and that definitely added to the enjoyment of watching this , if enjoyment is the right word. Steve Carell is fantastic as Du Pont and there are good performances from Channing Tatum ad Mark Ruffalo. Although the story revolves around wrestling , that is not what this film is really about. it's all about the mind of Du Pont and the further this film goes on you get the feeling that something isn't at all right with this man. you are never quite sure what his motives were for what he was doing , whether it was sexual , or ego based or that he was just lonely. Good film and i wouldn't be surprised if Steve Carrel wins best male actor at the Oscars but i would give it to Eddie Redmayne for The Theory of Everything it was me.7 out of 10",7,0,4,22 January 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," At last a film to compare to the original
","Having recently bought the box set of all the old Planet of the apes movies i couldn't believe how they had dated and how bad ( apart from the 1st) these films really were. Tim Burton tries to address this a few years ago by doing a remake but let's face it - It's Tim Burton , so it didn't quite work . Rise of The Planet of The Apes is the first of the movies that uses CGI instead of men in suits and because of that , this is probably the best POTA film that has been made to date.I wasn't too sure when i started watching this film if the CGI was really good enough. The scenes of the young Caesar are a little bit Pixar but you soon get used to it .The story is a simple one , not unlike the original and is easy to follow . The acting is OK and even the usual wooden Freida Pinto manages to get her lines out OK. There are some criticisms though. This is a little sugar coated at times. It would have been better if audience were more in side of the apes maybe by showing how they were experimented and i wasn't too sure about the final scenes of The Golden Gate Bridge . This film is fun without being a masterpiece and unsurprisingly it's all set up for a sequel which i look forward to seeing.",5,0,1,1 September 2011
Legend," Hardy is the best thing about Legend
",The Krays have become almost legendary in British folklore despite the fact that they were basically just a couple of thugs that ruled by fear. Legend just adds to the glamorisation of the brothers and glamorous is what this film is. Tom Hardy is absolutely brilliant as he plays both the Krays . Ronnie always wearing the glasses . The film follows just a small but significant period of their reign of terror and if you are familiar with their story you won't learn anything new . This looks fantastic. The director has got the 1960's period down to a tee and there is no doubting that this a very entertaining film but i could have done without the narration and it probably would benefit from having 20 minutes shaved off of the running time.,7,1,2,25 December 2015
Beasts of No Nation," Brutily stunning
","This is the story of a young boy, Agu, who is forced to join a group of soldiers in an unnamed West African country after he is forced out of his village when government forces slaughter friends and family. This time two years ago there was lots of talk about Idris Elba winning big awards for his portrayal of Nelson Mandela but although a good performance the film itself disappointed. If this film doesn't win top awards , including Oscars , I will be astounded. This is without doubt one of the best films of the year. It's not only Idris Elba's best screen performance to date there is also another amazing display and this time from Abraham Attah , a 14 year old. This is brutal film . Director ,Cary Joji Fukunaga doesn't hold back and that's what makes this film feel so real. Despite this being nearly two and a half hours long , it flew by and ever since I saw it a couple of days ago I can't seem to get it out of my head. Highly Recommended.",9,3,4,14 December 2015
Drive," Gosling picks another gem
",Ryan Gosling is hot property in Hollywood at the moment. He has so much screen presence and his acting is extremely good. He also has the knack of picking great films and 'Drive' is no exception.This is the story of a young mechanic who does a few jobs on the side . He is a stunt driver in the movies and also a getaway driver for some unscrupulous gangsters.. He finds himself caught up with the mob when a job goes wrong and the life of a female neighbour and her son become his priority. This really is an adrenalin filled movie. Not just because of the driving ( There actually isn't a great deal) but because of the violence. It has the feel of a Tarentino film but without the dialogue. Gosling is superb as are Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman. I have a sneaky feeling this could be up for a few awards in the new year and i think it deserves it.,9,1,3,23 October 2011
Insidious," Spoilt by the comical Ghostbusters.
",It's not easy to make genuinely scary horror movie any more. Most great ideas have been done and Hollywood has a lazy habit remaking the best Asian and European horrors and failing Miserably. Insidious is an above average horror that really tries it's best to scare the audience but ultimately is let down by a ridiculous storyline and the introduction of two comical characters.This film is a little bit like freeky 1980's horror film Poltergeist. The kid gets lost in some kind of ghost world so the family call in a specialist to get him back. the problem with this film is that the specialist brings with her a comical pair of ghostbusters and it totally kills the atmosphere.This film does have it's fair share of scary moments and for that it has to be applauded but in the end it just falls short of being a really good horror flick.,7,0,1,5 July 2011
2012," Disastrous movie not a disaster Movie
","I cant imagine what it would be like to face the end of the world but thanks to watching two and a half hours of one of the most ridiculous films i have ever seen , 2012 , i have a pretty good idea how painful it might be! The first 45 minutes of this film was not too bad. The special affect were pretty good and the action was full on but there is only so much you can take of over the top CGI and far fetched plot lines. Cusack is exactly as he always is in every film and Chiwetel Ejiofor continues to surprise me by getting big roles in movies because he lacks any kind of personality. By the end of the film i didn't care who lived or died i just wanted it to end . 2010 is not so much a disaster movie more a disastrous one.

Room," Brilliantly acted
","Room is one of those film that is hard to talk about without disclosing what happens in the film but basically it's the story of a mother and child who have been held captive in a room and when they get the chance to escape the boy finds the word outside that he was always told wasn't real. It's a wonderfully acted drama that has you thinking throughout . You think the worst has happened but perhaps the worst is yet to come , especially for the young boy ? Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are superb as the two leads and understandably this has got a lot of accolades since it's release. I think it's one of those films that I will like even more the more when I think about it and look back on it.",8,1,6,22 January 2016
Gran Torino," Not Eastwoods Best but still good
","There have been rumours rife that Clint Eastwood has hung up his acting gloves. The great man himself has hinted that Grand Torino might be the last time we see him in front of the camera and if that is correct it will herald the end of an era. Some have suggested that his performance as Walt Kowalski is his best ever but that is ridiculous thing to say. While this film and his performance is good it can't compare to likes of Bill Muny in The Unforgiven , Harry Callahan in the Dirty Harry series , Philo Beddoe in the Every which way comedies or his best character Blondie in the Good the Bad and The ugly. A racist Korean War veteran living in a crime-ridden Detroit neighbourhood is forced to confront his own lingering prejudice when a troubled Hmong teen from his neighbourhood attempts to steal his prized Gran Torino. Decades after the Korean War has ended, ageing veteran Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is still haunted by the horrors he witnessed on the battlefield. The two objects that matter most to Kowalski in life are the classic Gran Torino that represents his happier days working in a Ford assembly plant, and the M-1 rifle that saved his life countless times during combat. When Kowalski's teenage neighbour (Bee Vang) attempts to steal his Gran Torino as part of a gang initiation rite, the old man manages to catch the aspiring thief at the business end of his well-maintained semi-automatic rifle. Later, due to the pride of the Asian group, the boy is forced to return to Kowalski's house and perform an act of penance. In an effort to set the teen on the right path in life and toughen him up, the reluctant vet sets him up with an old crony who now works in construction. In the process, Kowalski discovers that the only way to lay his many painful memories to rest is to finally face his own blinding prejudice head-on....I think my expectation were probably too high before watching Grand Torino. I had read so many high praising reviews so i couldn't wait to get my hands on it. while i enjoyed it i found it a little disjointed. There were so many improbables and unanswered questions that came out of this film. Questions like ' Why did his neighbours put up with the constant racist name calling and not say anything to him or just walk away? Why did the gangster cousins machine gun the house of their Family and not Walts? I also thought the racist overtones went a little over the top. I wasn't offended but i got the point in the first half hour what type of man Kowalski so i didn't think it did his character any favours by him continuously insulting people,or perhaps i missed the point? Don't get me wrong Grand Torino is very entertaining but it has too many flaws to be classed a great movie. Clint Eastwood apart , the acting is pretty average and that's being kind. Bee Vang who plays Thao is very wooden. It felt like he is reading from a prompt card. I feel mean for saying that because i know he is an amateur actor but i have to say it as i see itSome of the faces that Eastwood Pulls remind me a lot of Harry Callaghan and that scowl made me smile. It also made me feel sad that it's unlikely we will see it again. There is one scene in Particular where he says 'Ever notice how you come across somebody once in a while you shouldn't have f****d with? That's me. ' He could quite easily have been that young man again.I obviously didn't enjoy this as much as many others but it's still entertaining in it's own right and i really do hope that it's not the last time we see the great man acting.7 out of 10",7,0,3,4 March 2009

",Ex Machina is a slick Sci Fi film about a low level employee of the words biggest search engine company who is selected by the billionaire owner to participate in an experiment in artificial intelligence by evaluating a female robot or A.I. This is a fascinating film. It looks fantastic and you are quite never sure of the motives of the characters on display.It's difficult to say too much about it without giving the plot away.

The Twilight Saga: New Moon," ZZZZZ is it finished yet?
","Unless you are a 13 year old girl , it's not seen as a good thing to say you like the Twilight movies. I found out the hard way when i gave the first movie a good review. I really enjoyed the film having known nothing about the books and i was really looking forward to the second instalment - New Moon and to see what happens with both Edward and Bella. Sadly the answer is not a lot. New Moon is a bloated movie that drags , and drags and drags while not a lot happens. Just after Bella's 18th birthday, Edward decides to leave her behind in an effort to protect her. As the heartbroken Bella sleepwalks through her senior year, numb and alone, she discovers she can summon Edward's image whenever she puts herself in jeopardy. Her desire to be with him at any cost leads her to take greater and greater risks, including a new taste for high-speed motorcycle jaunts.With the help of Jacob Black , her childhood friend and a member of the mysterious Quileute tribe, Bella refurbishes a motorbike for her adventures. Bella's frozen heart is gradually thawed by her budding relationship with Jacob, who has a supernatural secret of his own.When Bella wanders alone into a meadow, she finds herself face to face with a deadly attacker. Only the intervention of a pack of extraordinarily large wolves saves her from a grisly fate and the encounter makes it frighteningly clear that Bella is still in grave danger. In a race against the clock, Bella learns the ancient secret of the Quileute tribe and Edward's true motivation for leaving her. She also faces the prospect of a potentially deadly reunion with her beloved that is quite unlike the one she had hoped for.I'm not convinced about a acting ability of Kristen Stewart. Having seen her now in two Twilight movies and Adventureland I'm starting to think that she flatters to deceive. After two hours of her constant moping and moaning in this movie and a similar performance in adventureland I'm not too impressed. Now with Robert Patterson , i feel completely different. I like his style of acting . Where Kristen Stewart looks like she is just going through the motions , Patterson puts everything into making Edward as mysterious as a Vampire could possibly be. New Moon isn't a total disaster . It looks great and there are a couple of really good fight scenes , one involving the Wolves and the other Aro's henchmen and Edward. The Problem is the story of whether Bella is to become a vampire is impossible to sustain throughout the entire two hours and it's difficult not to feel bored. The final scene is so anticlimactic and without giving anything away all i can say is , only a woman could find it in any way interesting . I just hope the next movie is a lot better otherwise i feel that the audience for these movies will just be the screaming teenage girls.",6,3,4,19 March 2010
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Stunning!
","This year i have been under the misconception that the films nominated in this years 'Best Picture' category at the Oscars are not up to the standard of recent years. Don't get me wrong , 'Milk' and 'Slumdog Millionaire' are good films but are they great? Not in my opinion , but last night i watched a movie that blew me away.A stunning film that lives up to it's hype and goes straight into my top 10 films of all time .That film is 'The Curious case of Benjamin Button'. As soon as i heard those words 'I was born under unusual circumstances.' i was hooked.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is adapted from the 1920s story by F. Scott Fitzgerald about a man who is born in his eighties and ages backwards: a man, like any of us, who is unable to stop time. We follow his story, set in New Orleans from the end of World War I in 1918, into the 21st century, following his journey that is as unusual as any man's life can be.Directed by David Fincher and starring Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. Benjamin Button is a grand tale of a not-so-ordinary man and the people and places he discovers along the way, the loves he finds, the joys of life and the sadness of death, and what lasts beyond time.I love films that bring out emotion in me. I'm not the most open person at the best of times as friends and family will confirm I'm sure! So when i get emotion over a film it has to be good.Watching 'The Curious case of Benjamin Button' makes you realise how lucky you are to have the love of friends and family and to have a lifetime of that support. The idea of a baby being born an old man who gradually gets younger is a brilliant one yet tragic. It instantly raises so many questions. questions that do not always have pleasant answers.Brad Pitt is fantastic as strangely youngering ( is that a word or is there a word that is the opposite to ageing?) man. His screen presence is mesmerising throughout which is not easy considering the length of the movie.There are been many plaudits for the special affect and they are totally deserved but it's not so much the affects of when Benjamin Button and Daisy are old it's the ones when they are young. How they got Brad Pitt and Kate blanchett to look 20 is amazing. There is one scene in particular that rang so true for me. It was when Button explains the circumstances of how Daisy broke her leg and how if just one single thing like a Taxi Driver being delayed by 5 seconds because of a series of trivial events had not happened , her life could have been so different and that is so true for all of us .What if your father had not gone out the night he met your mother because of something trivial like a car breaking down or a minor illness? Think about it.As Benjamin Button says ' Your life is defined by its opportunities... even the ones you miss.' The last twenty minutes is gut wrenchingly sad .When Button goes from a young man to a child and he loses his memory of Daisy i found myself filling up.The curious case of Benjamin Button might not win the big one tonight at the Oscars but in my mind it has already won. It's such a magical , mystical , gem of a movie that will live with me for a very long time. 10 out of 10",10,3,7,22 February 2009
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Stunning!
","There have been many films over years that have told about the Holocaust but how many i wonder have been told from the side of the Germans or in this case a German child ? Although ' The boy in the striped pajamas' has a brutal subject matter it is a surprisingly gentle movie ( apart from the climax of the film) and without a doubt this is one of my favourite movies of 2009 so far. Bruno, is the son of strict commander of a Nazi concentration camp. He has a strong headed sister, Gretel. They live in a five storey mansion, but are one day suddenly moved to a place called OutWith (Auschwitz). Bruno, outraged by his father's decision to move to OutWith, and desperate to go home, spends his time in his room with no friends. He is also annoyed by the fact that they live in a three story house instead of their old fivestory mansion, and with such a small space, there isn't any room for exploration to be done. He also misses sliding down the banister in their old house.From his bedroom window, Bruno spots a fence with people in striped pyjamas behind it. These are the Jews, and they are in a concentration camp. One day his parents come to an agreement that both Bruno and Gretel need a tutor for their education so they hire Herr Liszt. To Bruno, Herr Liszt is the most boring teacher one could ever have  because he teaches science instead of the arts, which Bruno prefers. So, in boredom and confusion he wonders what is going on at OutWith and why people are always dressed in striped pajamas there.It takes a great writer to tell a story about such evil especially through the eyes of a child and Mark Herman's screenplay of the novel by John Boyne is a fantastic adaptation.The dialogue is delightful and only enhanced by some stunning acting. Asa Butterfield is fantastic as the Bruno the son of a Nazi officer and his scenes with Jack Scanlon (Shmuel) are deserved of the highest praise. There are also great performances from David Thewlis ( The Nazi Father) and David Hayman ( The Jewish Servant). This is a film about childhood innocence and friendship and how children are taught to hate and are not born thinking that way. The final ten minutes is a stunning example of film making .It looks amazing yet is still horrific and it's hard not to feel deep emotion in what is unfolding in front of your eyes.I'm not sure how much of a distribution this movie got in the States ( not much i suspect) when it was released in November but so far it has grossed $31m worldwide which is fantastic achievement for a fairly low budget BBC film and just goes to show what a great film this really is. The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas ( UK Spelling) is released on DVD on March the 9th here in the UK. Highly recommended . 9 out of 10",9,3,5,16 February 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," QT does comic book like nobody else.
","Kill Bill is pure unadulterated Quentin Tarantino self indulgence and although i think that Tarantino should have found a way to make both volumes into one film i still love this movie.Uma Thurman is the perfect actress for this film and it's enough to make you wanna go out and buy a yellow and black jump suit.! Kill Bill is comic book cinema at it's very best. Directors that try to make comic book's into film would do good to see how QT does it first. Gallons of blood , Superb martial arts , a wonderful script and some fantastic acting all make the ingredients of a memorable film. Oh and the brilliant soundtrack helps too. I Cant wait to see the second volume and if memory serves me right , it's even better than the first.",9,1,3,28 May 2011
Jurassic World," I wanted everyone to die.
","The overriding thing i took away from watching Jurassic World was not that the characters were utterly stupid ( they were ) or that the story was dull and predictable ( it was ) , it's that considering this film was made 22 years after the original it doesn't look any better . In fact i would say it looks worse. I was looking forward to watching Chris Pratt again after his brilliant performance in Guardians of the Galaxy but even he was dull in this. This movie was crying out for a Jeff Goldblum , Sam Neil or a Richard Attenborough but what we got was a ridiculously over the top Bryce Dallas Howard and Vincent D'Onofrio. I even wanted the Dinosaurs to eat the kids but we all knew that wasn't going to happen. The only thing i really like about this is who the actual hero in the end is. I thought that was quite clever. I didn't absolutely hate this but i didn't like it very much either. 4 out of 10",4,75,151,29 July 2015
The Adjustment Bureau," Better than Inception
","It was inevitable that there would be comparisons with The Adjustment Bureau and last year's big hit Inception. Both are about changing time , perception and fate but there is one big difference between both of the films and that is that The Adjustment Bureau is better .This film is not complicated at all , despite being far fetched and at no time do you think ' What the hell is going on here' as i did with Inception. Sure , it does not have the fantastic special affects but to be honest , affects are not good when the plot is a mess.Matt Damon plays a politician who meets a beautiful woman and it's love at first sight. The problem is the Bureau can't let it progress because it's not part of the plan. I really enjoyed Matt Damon's performance as well as Emily Blunt's and Anthony Mackie's . It's the kind of film that does not patronise the audience with a plot that needs several viewing to understand it and it's not too long either.Well worth watching.",8,2,3,23 March 2011
Everest," Very immersive disaster movie.
","This is the true story of two different expeditions in 1996 who attempt to scale Everest but encounter massive storms on the descent down the mountain. Everest is a stunning looking film that you come away from , feeling totally exhausted. Because it is so realistic you do feel you are with the climbers at times. Sure , it's a stock disaster movie but because of the nature of the true story behind it , you feel more connected. The special affects are amazing and the performances from Jason Clarke and Keira Knightley are great too. I watched this in 3D but ended up taking the glasses off because it was so annoyingly dark so i recommend watching it in 2D instead. It's a staggering statistic that 1 in 4 people who attempt to get get to the summit of Everest , dies. Why do people do it? that question is asked in this film but apart from the stock answer of ' Because it's there' it is never really answered . Perhaps there isn't one?",8,64,102,11 September 2015
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," What a mess!
","As i have said before on more than one occasion ,I'm not a big Jim Carey fan. When i have mentioned this in the past there is always one person who says ' but have you seen Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'? Well i hadn't up until now and what i am going to say about it is bound to upset a few people.Joel is stunned to discover that his girlfriend Clementine has had her memories of their tumultuous relationship erased. Out of desperation, he contacts the inventor of the process, Dr. Howard Mierzwiak , to have Clementine removed from his memory. But as Joel's memories progressively disappear, he begins to rediscover their earlier passion. From deep within the recesses of his brain, Joel attempts to escape the procedure. As Dr. Mierzwiak and his crew chase him through the maze of his memories, it's clear that Joel just can't get her out of his head.Firstly there is nothing wrong with Jim Carey in this film . In fact it's refreshing to see him not pulling stupid faces. I enjoyed the acting of Kate Winslett too but the film itself left me cold.Looking at IMDb.com nearly everyone gives this top marks and it's listed as the the 59th best movie of all time. I don't get it? Is there something profound in this film that i missed? The idea is a good one but the execution is not. I found the timeline extremely confusing and the conclusion unsatisfactory. Perhaps my expectations were to high? I was expecting something special but i ended up getting a film that was trying to be far to clever for it's own good.It reminded me a little of Being John Malkovich. That too was pretentious nonsense and yet everyone praised it . Not Me. It's like the Emperors new clothes story . Once one person jumps up and say ' I love it' everyone jumps on the band wagon.If i had the telephone number of the memory eraser's i would call them to erase my memory of this movie.To sum up i found Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind a self indulgent mess and if that upsets people i make no apologies for my honesty.4 out of 10",Null,5,13,11 January 2009
Once Upon a Time in America," NOT the greatest gangster film ever made but still good
","Sergio Leone was a fantastic film director. Not everything he did was perfect , far from it , but you cant deny that he had a directing style all of his own. Usually his films contained lots of close up portrait shots, a haunting and memorable soundtrack and usually his movies were very long. Once upon a time in America was the last film Sergio Leone ever directed and without doubt was one of his finest.When he was a boy, Noodles and his friends would roll drunks and make trouble in their Jewish immigrant neighbourhood. His life changed, however, when he met Max . Together the two of them and their gang began planning more complex jobs and successfully making money. As they grow up learning about crime together, they also learn about life and love.Their friendship is interrupted when Noodles is sent to jail as an adolescent, but although he is a young man when he is freed, Max is there to collect him. He discovers that his partners have been busy in his absence, taking advantage of the money to be made illegally during prohibition, and for some time he joins in with their business. But prohibition isn't going to last forever, and when it ends Noodles is concerned that Max's next job is a step too far.I have heard it said by some people that Once upon a time in America is the greatest gangster movie of all time. In my opinion this is way of the mark. It may have been the best up until 1984 ( Godfather fans will disagree) but six years later Martin Scorsese paired up Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci once again to make not only the perfect gangster movie but the greatest movie ever made - GoodfellasIn some ways this film is very Scorsese like. It reminded me a lot of 'Mean Streets'. Robert De Niro is fantastic as Noodles as is James Woods as Max ' don't call me crazy' Bailey. Neither of which turn out to be very nice people. I would have like to have seen the Joe Pesci Character a lot more but he just disappears from the movie without explanation. The timeline drifts quite a bit and it does get a little confusing in the latter part of the film especially due to the extremely poor make up job done on Elizabeth McGovern who played Deborah Gelly . At one stage she is supposed to be the same age as Noodles expect he looks 60 and she still looks 21 . Another problem is the length of the film 3 hours 49 minutes . I'm sorry but that's just too long for a film. Apparently there is a version that is just 144 minutes made for the American Audience but it is cut in chronological order that makes very little sense.I found this to be a very sexually charged movie. Some scenes are quite graphic and i am surprised they got past the censor back in the eighties. The rape scene and the peeping scenes are two that i wont forget in a hurry. As with all Sergio Leone films i loved the soundtrack. Those haunting panpipes sound like they have come straight from one of his spaghetti westerns. the cinematography also looks fantastic. Especially the scenes set during twenties and thirties. This is an epic film about , innocence, trust, passion, honor, Friendship , betrayal, and guilt and was a fitting finale to the career of a great director. 8 out of 10",9,1,4,19 May 2009
Taken," Good Fun!
","Liam Neeson is not the first actor who springs to mind when you think of movie action heroes. For a start he's 56 years old but why should that get in the way , look at Harrison Ford . The difference is Bryan Mills is no Indiana Jones! He's one guy you don't p**s off and for very good reason! 'Taken' is '24' meets 'The Bourne Identity'. It stars Liam Neeson as Bryan Mills, a retired American spy whose daughter Kim (Maggie Grace from 'Lost') is kidnapped in Paris while he's on the phone to her from Los Angeles. The kidnappers come on the line and Mills tries to warn them what they're letting themselves in for:'I don't know who you are. If you're looking for ransom, I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills acquired over a very long career in the shadows, skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that will be the end of it. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you. And I will kill you.' But do they listen? Do they merde!Now ,' Taken ' really is a film that you have to turn of the logic side of your brain before you go into the Cinema. If you do that then your in for one hell of ride . It's action all the way and quite brutal action at times too. Neeson manages to kicks the butts of men half his age but somehow it works. He comes away from situations without a scratch while his enemies suffer thanks to his US military training. If i had to criticise this film for anything it's not for the fact that it's ridiculously far fetched or the script is a little stiff its because of the way Neeson's Character reacts when his daughter say shes going on holiday to Europe to watch U2 . You would think that she just told her dad she was of to Beirut to join Hezbollah! Your much more likely to get into trouble in the big Cities of the US than in places like Paris or London. Personally i would have been more concerned that my daughter was listening to crap like U2!But who am i to criticise as predictably daddy is proved right when she is whisked off by some nasty dark skinned Europeans before she's even unpacked!. How have i survived all this time living and working in London!That criticism aside i really enjoyed Taken. It's pure adrenaline packed entertainment and maybe we do have a new competitor to rival the three B's - Bond , Bourne & Bauer ?I wouldn't say no to another portion of Bryan Mills and his no nonsense approach to life.Good fun.Taken is released in the US on January 30th 2009.8 out of 10",8,0,0,18 November 2008

The Artist," Lives up to the Hype
","What with so many films up for awards being a big let down i was hoping The Artist was a film that at least , lived up to it's hype. Thankfully it did.George Valentin is a famous silent movies start who is loved by himself nearly as much as his fans. He meets , by chance , up and coming actress Peppy Miller and he falls in love. The problem is that Peppy is making it big in Talkies and George finds that silent movies are dying along with his career.I never thought i would like a silent movie as much as i liked this one. This is a very cleverly made film that keeps the audience spellbound by some fantastic backing music and three brilliant performances from Jean Dujardin , Berenice Bejo and a delightful little Jack Russel.I love the first 15 miniues of this film. Jean Dujardin is in his element both in the film and with his acting. The smile and swagger of George is superb and you cant but help like the man. Berenice Bejo is just the same. A lovely smile and wonderful attitude and you can see why any man would fall for her.The film does dip a little in the middle and maybe could do with ten minutes being shaved off it but apart from that The Artist is everything that people are saying.",9,9,14,15 February 2012
Limitless," Limitless is a fix i can get high on.
","While Robert De Niro's movie career has been on a continual down turn for the last 15 years , Bradley Cooper's is definitely on the up but luckily , with Limitless , both actors have struck gold. This is a cracking thriller that is fast paced from the very start. It has a superb and original story that has you thinking throughout but without ever being confused. There are lots of drug addiction connotations you can make with the story yet this never really feels like a story about drugs even though it should. Cooper is the perfect actor for the role of Eddie Morra . charming , yet somehow vulnerable and I'm pleased to at last say that Robert De Niro is great too. It's many years since i have been able to say that. There's nothing NOT to like about Limitless. It's a roller Coaster ride that i recommend everyone goes on. Or should you? Don't forget kids ' Just say no'.",9,1,2,13 April 2011
Don't Breathe," Basting the turkey will never be the same again.
",Not being a massive fan of horror films I'm quite selective in which ones I watch . The reviews for this were pretty good so I gave it a go and I have to say I really enjoyed it. It's the story of three friends who decide to rob the home of a blind war veteran but things go terribly wrong when they find out that there is more to this man than they first thought. What I like about this is that it doesn't have any supernatural aspect to the story so it feels more real than most horrors. There are some quite disturbing scenes so it's not for the faint hearted . One especially involving a turkey baster but you will have to see the film to find out what that's all about ! All in all it's well worth a watch but not with granny at Christmas.,7,13,24,22 December 2016
Sicario," Brutily stunning
","Sicario could be described as grim , dark or even depressing at times. There is no joy in the story that is being told here but despite all that it is utterly brilliant. This is the story of an FBI agent ( Emily Blunt ) who is seconded into an elite unit that deals with the drug barons on the Mexican border but not is all it seems. She is told very little and what she does know she doesn't like. This film is intense. It really does grip you. The first half an hour , especially the scenes when we are in Mexico , are stunning . The director , Denis Villeneuve , pulls no punches whatsoever and along with some great performances from Blunt , Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro this is a visual and sensual treat. Highly Recommended.",10,1,4,20 December 2015
Departures," I was deeply moved
","If i told you to watch a subtitled film about a newly unemployed cellist who takes a job preparing the dead for funerals you would probably tell me to get lost! If you did you couldn't be more wrong. Departures is a deeply moving movie , unlike anything i have ever seen before.

All this is done in a very beautiful and tasteful way. One of the main reasons why i can relate to this film is that the lead character has a father who abandoned him at a young age and the next time he heard from him was when he was told he had dies. That is exactly my situation , and because of that i found the final 15 minutes extremely moving . This wont be for everyone because a lot of people wont have the patience to get to the end but if you do you will not regret it.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Comedy and soundtrack are the highlights
","Of all the Marvel films that I have seen over the last decade , The Dark Knight and Guardians of the Galaxy are my favourites. Because of this I was so looking forward to Volume 2 and I'm please to say I wasn't disappointed. This time the Guardians come across a mysterious being known as Ego , who claims to be the long-lost father of team leader Peter Quill . As Quill learns more about his past, the Guardians do battle with enemies old and new.The reason I really enjoy these films have nothing to do with the story lines but more about the humour and soundtrack and volume 2 is ram packed full great tunes and brilliant one liners. Dave Bautista gets the best lines and he's laugh is infectious. From the brilliant opening credits where Groot is dancing to Mr Blue Sky by E.L.O while the guardians are fighting for their lives , you can't help smiling . loads of great obscure songs are squeezed into this film and there some inspired choices. Only when the film concentrated on the action in the second half of the film did I find myself getting a little bored not that the action wasn't great. Good stuff",8,2,5,29 April 2017
The Shape of Water," Seriously over hyped
","There are some actors and directors that can do no wrong in the eyes of The Academy and serious critics. Guillermo del Toro is definitely one of those directors. Don't get me wrong , he has made some very good films but sadly , in my opinion , The Shape of Water is definitely not one of them.
In the hidden high security government laboratory where she works, lonely Elisa is trapped in a life of isolation. Elisa's life is changed forever when she and co-worker Zelda discover a secret classified experiment on a water based man like creature. Elisa finds she is falling in love with a creature that others want dead.I really do not know what all the fuss was about with this film. Sure , Sally Hawkins and Michael Shannon are good but they usually always are. This had the feel of an average story that you might have seen on an episode of The Twilight Zone . For a Del Toro film the special affects were very average , almost like a B movie from back in the day. Perhaps that was what he was trying to achieve ?
Why this is has been nominated for 13 Oscars is a mystery to me because this film was average at best.",6,27,52,16 February 2018

If you and your family have money problems like George Bailey it's not the end of the world because you have each other. Your children are everything and that's the feeling i got from this film. It takes a lot of it's ideas from Charles Dickens's 'A Christmas Carol' and gives it a modern edge. Even though this film is 65 years old it does not matter. It will guarantee to put a tear in your eye and that last 10 minutes is what feel good movies are all about. James Stewart puts in the performance of his life and will probably always be known for this film and quite rightly so. This movie deserves to be high up in the list of the best movies of all time.",10,1,2,20 November 2010

One by one the children are either taken or possessed by the evil spirits that surround them. This is a very difficult film to watch. Not because it's scary ( it Isn't ) but because the language and vocabulary spoken is of the period . It's also full of religious speak which grates after a while. I've read some glowing reviews of this film yet I didn't get it all. Call me old fashioned but I want my horror movies to be scary , this was just darkly depressing. The one good thing I can say about The Witch is that it looks great. The cinematography is first class and authentic . Shame about the rest of the movie.",3,2,4,24 August 2016
Steve Jobs," A Character assassination ?
","I love watching Screen writer , Aaron Sorkin's work. The West Wing and The Newsroom are two of my favourite TV shows of all time and all I can say than god Sorkin was involved with this film because otherwise it could have been a disaster. This is not a biography of Steve Jobs more a character assassination of the man. It revolves around four product launches and the arguments he has at the time with nearly everyone around him. It feels like a redemption movie but Steve Jobs wasn't that bad as to make the point. He was a businessman and acted like most successful driven people do. The stand out performance is from Seth Rogan ( you won't here me say that too often!) who plays Steve Wozniak . I only wish Rogan would play straight roles more often, Overall this is watchable for the fast flowing , Sorkin Dialogue , but other than that , because of the strange format , it's quite forgettable.",6,3,6,29 December 2015
Downfall," The best movie portrayal of Adolf Hitler ever?
","There have been hundreds of actors over the years who have portrayed Adolf Hitler but I'm pretty sure there has been no better depiction of the Nazi leader than the one done by Bruno Ganz. This is a brilliant film about the final hours of Hitler, his foot soldiers and the people who worked and lived around him in his bunker.Unlike most war films this is a German made movie with German actors and this gives this so much more authenticity. Not surprisingly this was nominated for an Oscar and i have no doubt if this had been an American film , Bruno Ganz would have won the best actor award.There is one heartbreaking scene where Magda Goebbels gives her children poison while they are asleep and it just goes to show how far some of the top Nazi's would go not to surrender under any circumstances. Downfall is one of the best films i have seen about the end of WWII and if you the slightest bit interested in what happened in that infamous bunker you have to see this film.",9,4,6,10 January 2011

Hail , Caesar is about a fixer in Hollywood ( Josh Brolin) who is paid by the studio to keep the actors in line. There are some interesting performances from George Clooney and Alden Ehrenreich and a very camp but hypnotic musical scene lead by Channing Tatum .

Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Apatow and Ferrell's best comedy
","I've often wondered what the appeal is with Judd Apatow comedies and especially the ones that star Will Ferrell. They normally bore the pants off of me. Now i know how they gained their reputation and that's because of the hilarious Anchorman - The legend of Ron Burgundy. Even though this film had gained a sort of cult status I wasn't expecting to like this at all , yet i loved it. It reminded me a little of the Aeroplane movies. It's the sort of comedy that you would have to watch two or three times just to catch all the jokes. This film is full of subtle jokes surrounded by gags that are as subtle as a brick. Silly yes but also very funny.Ferrell is good but he's not really the star . I love Steve Carell as the weatherman and Paul Rudd who plays Brian Fantana but the scene that will stick in my mind for a very long time is when they are in the news office and they all start singing ' Afternoon Delight' in acapalla .

The Wrestler," Rourke is amazing
","The Wrestler - My Review Category: Movies, TV, Celebrities To say Mickey Rourke's career has been up and down is a bit of an understatement. Back in the 80's he showed great promise when starring in films like ' Nine and a half weeks' ',Rumble Fish and my personal favourite ' Angelheart' . The trouble was , Rourke had a self destruct button that he seemed to press far to often . He was hated here in the UK at the time for donating some of his salary to Irish terrorist's the IRA .Directors began to avoid him and the movie roles dried up. He even embarked on a career in Boxing until retiring undefeated after eight fights. After that he seemed to disappear off the face of the earth.A few years ago a was reading a magazine and i saw a photo of Mickey Rourke and i couldn't believe what i saw. His appearance had changed dramatically because of excessive plastic surgery and seemed to have lost his boyish good looks. Understandably the opportunity to make it big again in acting seemed a million miles away. That is until a director called Darren Aronofsky decided to show faith in him and what a fantastic decision that turned out to be! Back in the late '80s, Randy 'The Ram' Robinson was a headlining professional wrestler. Now, 20 years later, he ekes out a living performing for handfuls of die-hard wrestling fans in high school gyms and community centers around New Jersey.Estranged from his daughter and unable to sustain any real relationships, Randy lives for the thrill of the show and the adoration of his fans. However, a heart attack forces him into retirement. As his sense of identity starts to slip away, he begins to evaluate the state of his lifetrying to reconnect with his daughter, and strikes up a blossoming romance with an aging stripper . Yet all this cannot compare to the allure of the ring and passion for his art, which threatens to pull Randy 'The Ram' back into his world of wrestling.The Wrestler is without doubt one of the best movies i have seen in a while. How , at this years Oscars , it was not nominated for Best Picture or why Mickey Rourke didn't win best performance by an actor in a leading role is beyond me. It's certainly a better than Sean Penn's lead in 'Milk'. Perhaps he burnt too many bridges in the past amongst the film fraternity and he's now paying the price ? His portrayal of Randy Robinson is so real. It feels like it could be a documentary it's that real. I loved his honesty and the way he knew he had done wrong in his life but he just wanted to make things good but wrestling was his life and ultimately his downfall. In his own words ' I'm an old broken down piece of meat and I deserve to be all alone, I just don't want you to hate me' It's not just the wrestling scenes that Rourke performs that are impressive it's his overall acting. I never ever thought he had that ability in him .One interesting fact that i found out was that Nic Cage was originally going to be in the lead role of The Wrestler - thank god that never happened.The Gorgeous Marisa Tomei is superb also and the comparison of her lap dancing career being the same as 'The Rams' wrestling career did not go unnoticed. I'm not sure if some of the blood in the wrestling scenes were real but it certainly looked it and director Darren Aronofsky deserves enormous credit for coming up with a thoroughly gripping and entertaining movie and when those final credits roles it left with me wanting more.10 out of 10",10,1,2,9 March 2009

Little does WALL-E realize that he has recently stumbled onto a secret that could save planet Earth, and once again make the ravaged planet safe for all humankind. When highly advanced search robot EVE makes friends with WALL-E and realizes the value of his remarkable discovery, she excitedly races back to let the humans know that there's hope for their home planet after all. But after centuries alone in space, WALL-E can't stand the thought of losing the only friend he's ever known, and eagerly follows her into the deepest reaches of space on the adventure of a lifetime. Along the way, the friendly trash-collecting robot who has always known what he was made for gradually begins to understand what he was meant for.Although , as i previously said i'm not big lover of animation i can appreciate a good film when i see one. If i had to pick my favourites of recent years i would say Toy Story 1 & 2 and Madagascar top the list.Wall-E is undoubtedly up there with some of the best Disney Pixar movies but i couldn't help being disappointed with what i saw.I really enjoyed the first half an hour when Wall-E was doing what he does best and there were some really clever moments but as soon as he clung on to Eva's ship and found the humans holiday paradise in the sky i felt it lost it's way.I also found it slightly depressing. I know it's a love story and a story about hope but what a grim look on the future the makers of the film have. Give me Buzz Light year or Woody anytime over the talking trash can and the fat humans. Wall-E cost 180 million dollars to make and while it certainly looks spectacular I'm baffled as to how it cost that much to make. Not that Disney Pixar care , it made a staggering 500 million dollars world wide.I think it would be be a big mistake if the Acadamy enter this film as best film and not best animated film. It's far more likely to win the latter.Finally the best judge of films like Wall-E are kids themselves and while my two sons enjoyed it , it hasn't been back in the DVD player since they watched it last week while in the meantime Alex and Marty in Madagascar have entertained them for 150th and 151st time. That says it all.7 out of 10",7,2,5,5 December 2008
The Big Short," Entertaining despite being a mine field for the financial novice.
","The Big Short is about the banking crisis in 2008 and how a few individuals predicted what was going to happen and acted accordingly.Back in 1993 there was a series of chess matched live on TV between Brit , Nigel Short and Russian , Garry Kasparov . Despite not knowing the rules or having ever played a game of chess I was mesmerised by these matches. This film was the same for me. I definitely enjoyed this film but despite them trying their best to explain what was going on it wasn't sinking in . It doesn't matter what you do to jazz it up , banking is and never will be sexy , even if you do involve Brad Pitt and Selena Gomez ! Despite that , this is a fairly entertaining film. I thought it might go down the Wolf of Wall Street route and focus on the excesses of the bankers but it concentrates more on their stupidity and then their absolute gall in getting away with what they did. I like the quirky way the story was told even if I still didn't understand all of it but that probably says more about me than the film.",7,1,1,21 January 2016
Paths of Glory," A film that spits in the face of authority
","Rated number 50 in the IMDb.com greatest movies of all time , Paths of Glory is not a film that i was particularly familiar with. I'm a fan of Stanley Kubrik and i love Kirk Douglas so it should come as no surprise that i really enjoyed this movie. When a group of soldiers in WW1 refuse to continue with an impossible attack, their superiors decide to make an example of them. I love the look of this film. You can pretty much tell this has Stanley Kubrick's fingerprints all over it. It asks uncomfortable political and social questions and you can't help but be angry at authority which is a thread that runs through a lot of Kubrik's movies. The acting is superb , especially from a super confident Kirk Douglas and like the fact that this does not have a sickly sweet outcome to it which was so common with war films made in the 40's and 50's. It's a film that spits in the face of authority while the common man suffers and i loved it.",8,1,3,12 May 2011
Straight Outta Compton," A film about a bunch of money obsessed aggressive young men.
",First i have to confess that before watching this i didn't have a clue who NWA was. The Hip Hip / Rap scene passed me by or more accurately i avoided it because i really can't stand rap. F. Gary Gray lazily presumes the audience is already familiar with these people and that annoyed me. I did not have a clue who the members of NWA were and i think that put me at a massive disadvantage when watching this film. The characters aren't the most likable of people. They seemed to spend the majority of the film scowling and arguing about money rather than making music and it this grated on me ( but not as much as the music) . Only in the last half an hour of the film do we actually see any form of compassion or humanity from the band members . It wasn't until the film showed a few real film footage clips near the end did i realise how well they did with the casting as the actors as they really do look like the real artists. Sadly that wasn't enough for me to like this film but i'm sure fans of NWA would totally disagree.,4,115,271,4 October 2015
Black Panther," Nothing special but enternaining none the less.
","Black Panther has been an incredibly success for Marvel . Up to this weekend it had taken 1.2 Billion dollars and I'm not surprised. My kids have been pestering me for weeks to take them to see this . thanks to some brilliant social media marketing ( especially on YouTube) and today we finally got to see it .It's the story of T'Challa who is crowned the king of Wakanda, a technologically advanced country in Africa that has hidden itself away from the rest of the world. T'Challa is charged with defending the nation in his guise as the costumed superhero known as Black Panther, but his reign is challenged by a Wakanda dissident named Erik Killmonger , who wants to sell the country's natural resources to fund an uprising.I have to admit I wasn't particularly looking forward to seeing this. I thought , because of the director and cast being predominantly black , that it might be more political than anything but it wasn't and to be fair it was just another enjoyable marvel movie.
The action is nothing new and it's too long . as all Marvel films are , but I liked it and more importantly my sons did too.
There are some good performances from Chadwick Boseman , Michael B. Jordan and Andy Serkis and I look forward to Black Panther linking up with a few of the more familiar Marvel super heroes.",7,0,2,17 March 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Why?
","To say this is stupid is an understatement. Rarely have I seen a film with so much going on that makes very little sense. It's hard to review a film like Batman v Superman and pinpoint it's faults without giving spoilers away but what I will say is never has a Batman been so dumb. The whole premise of the film is a battle between Batman and Superman but the reason for the conflict make absolutely no sense. The opening scenes are confusing and final scenes are utterly pointless. It's as if they had an idea to base a film around and shelved it two thirds into the movie. My kids were asking me questions about what was going on throughout the film and try as I might I couldn't always give them answers. It's not absolutely terrible but it is a mess. Despite being an executive producer , Christopher Nolan must be laughing his socks off.",5,2,9,27 March 2016
Blade Runner," It could have been made yesterday!
","I have no doubt in my mind that the decade in which movies look most dated is the 1980's. So how is it that Ridley Scott could make a film 30 years ago and made it look like it could have been made in 2011?For some reason i have never managed to watch Blade Runner all the way through before. I'm sure i have seen some bits but the entire film seems new to me. I cant get over how stunning this movie looks. Granted , i watched this for the first time on Blue Ray but regardless of the quality of the picture , this film looks so modern. The story is nothing special , it doesn't have to be , but thanks to some amazing performances from Rutger Hauer and Daryl Hannah and some masterfulll direction i can totally see why this has become a cult classic. I don't think Harrison Ford is that that great in the film , he pulls silly faces sporadically and he tries hard but he never puts in a great display of acting.I plan to see the directors cut at some stage to see how Ridely Scott intended this film to be. Perhaps the ending may have turn out to be a little darker?",8,3,7,4 May 2011
Son of Saul," Heartbreaking
","I have to admit I have been putting off watching Son of Saul because of it's content. A couple of days ago I finally got around to seeing it and it's stuck with me ever since. It's the story of a Jewish worker ( Saul) at the Auschwitz concentration camp who tries to find a rabbi to give a child , he calls his son , a proper burial. I was expecting this to be so graphic that it was going to be hard to watch but I didn't find it to be so. It's cleverly shot so you are focused just on Saul and hell around him is blurred or in the periphery . I found this heart breaking. Not because of the atrocities that were going on ( although they were terrible) but the fact that all that Saul wanted to do was give this teenage boy a proper burial. He didn't care for his own life . He'd given up believing that he would live. Son of Saul won this years best foreign language film of the year at the Oscars and it does make you wonder why films like this can't win best film in the main category ? Son of Saul is absolutely Brilliant.",9,1,4,31 July 2016
Amélie," You cant help but like Amelie
","If there is such a thing as a typical French film , Amelie is it . Quirky , dialogue heavy and never straight forward .Luckily i like the way the French make their films. This is no exception. Audrey Tautou is superb as the delightful Amelie , a woman who is happy seeing other people happy but is missing a certain something in her own life ...Love. This film looks and sounds great but it does lose it's way a little bit in the final third. You get a little frustrated that Amele is making extremely hard work of meeting her man but i suppose that's the way she is meant to be. Nominated for an Oscar , Amelie is delightful but it might not be everyone's cup of tea.",7,1,5,21 February 2011
Unbroken," A fitting tribute
","Unbroken is the story of Louis Zamperini an Olympian who spends a harrowing 47 days in a raft with two fellow crewmen before he's caught by the Japanese navy and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp. I have to admit this film got me. I didn't think i would fall for the sentimentality , director Angelina Jolie smothered this film with , but i did. It is an amazing story and Jack O'Connell is ever so impressive in the lead role. The ending is very emotional and Louis Zamperini deserves such a glowing tribute.Recommended9 out of 10",9,0,2,24 May 2015
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Better than i was expecting
","Having seen the trailer and read a couple of reviews for Kingsman: The Secret Service i wasn't expecting too much from this film but i actually thought it was a lot of fun. Sure , it has quite a few faults ( which film doesn't ? ) and it's extremely silly but the action is very good and at no stage was i bored. It's a cross between Spy Kids , James Bond and Austin Powers and it's strange to see Colin Firth involved in something so left of field but he does a pretty good job. The language is pretty raw through out so it's not something the kids or granny should watch , which is a shame because apart from that and the violence it's a very childish film.7 out of 10",7,1,6,4 June 2015
The Thin Red Line," A Brilliant Anti War movie
","Director, Terrance Malick is not everyones cup of tea but everything I've seen him do to date , I love and The Thin Red Line is no exception.In 1942, Private Witt is an Army absconder living peacefully with the locals of a small South Pacific island. Discovered by his commanding officer, Sgt. Welsh (Sean Penn), Witt is forced to resume his active duty training for the Battle of Guadalcanal.Anybody who follows Malick's movies will know at the heart of most of his work are stories about mortality and love . The way his skips from action to intimate moments brings home the fruitily of war and how easily life can be snuffed out and needlessly so .This movie has an amazing cast . Some big stars only have fleeting cameos , others like Sean Penn are continually on screen . The standout performances are from Jim Caviezel and Nick Nolte . Caviezel has a calmness that suits Malick's film making and Nolte probably puts in his last truly great performance.I've heard some people say that they found this hard work but I didn't . With a brilliant score from Hans Zimmer , I think this is a fantastic anti war film and I loved it.",9,1,2,8 April 2020
Da 5 Bloods," Spike Lee's Prize Turkey
","Say hello to Spike Lee's worst ever film .It's not only his worst film by a long , long way, it's an absolute Turkey in my opinion.I totally get the underlying sentiment of the film. How a disproportionate amount of young black men were sent to Vietnam to fight for a county that treated them so badly ( and still does) but make it a film about that and don't wrap it up in an awful film about retrieving gold and fighting the locals and each other .I'm not exaggerating when I say that at least an hour could have been cut from the film . When they found Storming Norman , I would have been quite happy if it would have ended there . In fact i would have doubled my score if it had but no , we get an extra hour of complete nonsense.All the major studios turned this film down and it was only Netflix that picked it up . You can see why .
It's an incredibly lazy film .
The flashbacks look great with the grainy 16mm film but why on earth didn't they use younger actors ? It looks ridiculous with four pensioners fighting alongside Chadwick Boseman . They couldn't even be bothered to get rid of the grey beards !Another problem I have is the horrendous soundtrack that overpowers the dialogue . It's like the backing music that should be on an epic like Laurence Of Arabia or blockbuster like Indiana Jones . It feels so out of place .If it's a social commentary on the black history of Vietnam you want then you get get a bit of that but for the most it's about a group of so called friends who do nothing but argue with each other for two and a half hours . It gave me a head ache .",3,8,15,15 June 2020
The Great Escape," A classic but not the best war movie
","Ask anybody of a certain age in the UK to name a war film and it's likely that The Great Escape will be the first mentioned. It's an iconic film that gets an airing on terrestrial TV every Christmas and nearly every public holiday. So to criticise it in anyway would be like telling your kindly ageing grandmother that she smells and her cooking sucks. So I'm going to show The Great Escape the respect it deserves and not be too critical.The Great Escape is based on the true story of a group of Allied prisoners of war who managed to escape from an allegedly impenetrable Nazi prison camp during World War II. At the beginning of the film, the Nazis gather all their most devious and troublesome POWs and place them at a new prison camp, which was designed to be impervious to escapes. Immediately, the prisoners develop a scheme where they will leave the camp by building three separate escape tunnels. Richard Attenborough is the British soldier who masterminds the whole plan, and who commands his motley squad--featuring Charles Bronson as a Polish trench-digging expert, James Garner as an American with a talent for theft, Donald Pleasence as a masterful forger, and Steve McQueen as an American rebel--through the construction of the tunnels and, eventually, their escape This is the first of four Steve Mcqueen films that i tend to review in the near future and is probably his most famous role. To be fair , it's not his most challenging role as regards acting is concerned. As like some of his other films the action scenes are the most memorable ones. His escape attempt from the Germans on a motorbike is the part of the film everyone remembers fondly and quite rightly so. You can see he's having so much fun in the muddy fields with that bike.The Great Escape is nearly three hours long but at no time does it drag. i think that's because of the great cast. Everyone is at the top of their game ( except James Coburn and his peculiar Australian accent) and it was not too often that a film a had such a mix of top British and American actors in one film. Richard Attenborough and Gordon Jackson are the serious players in the escape attempt while Steve Mcqueen and Angus Lennie bring a lighter side to the proceedings.It also has a very memorable and catchy soundtrack that everyone immediately recognises. What is it with films in the sixties and fantastic original soundtracks and why don't movies have them anymore? Being totally honest Stalag Luft III is portrayed more like a holiday camp than a prisoner of war camp but i suppose back it was made in 1963 , a little to close to the end of the war for it to be too brutal.The Great Escape is certainly not the best war film ever made , far from it , but it a great film for all the family to sit down and watch on a rainy Sunday afternoon.8 out of 10",9,0,2,16 March 2009
Pineapple Express," It's no Superbad
","I like Seth Rogan and Judd Apatow movies but i am getting a little bit concerned about how much longer that will last. It seems like every month there is a new movie involving either or both of them and they are in danger of overkill . At the moment their movies are making lots of money and i understand why they are making hay while the sun is shining but at what cost?Process server Dale Denton has a grudging business relationship with the laconic Saul Silver , deigning to visit only to purchase Saul's primo product -- a rare new strain of pot called Pineapple Express.But when Dale becomes the only witness to a murder by a crooked cop and the city's most dangerous drug lord , he panics and dumps the Pineapple Express at the scene. When it's traced back to him, Dale and Saul run for their lives... and they quickly discover that they're not just suffering from weed-fueled paranoia. If they survive, these two just might become real friends. All aboard the Pineapple Express.There have been many drug related comedies most of which i didn't care too much for . Not because I'm anti drugs but just because they have not been very funny. Pineapple express bucks that trend a little but i couldn't help feeling that this film didn't quite work.There are some funny moments in Pineapple Express . Some laugh out loud ones in fact but the last half an hour turned more into a farcical romp and the clever stuff went out of the window. I'm not sure why they felt they had to crank up the level of violence like they did but it didn't feel right in the context of the movie. Also some things just didn't ring true like ' what was a beautiful 18 year old girl doing with a loser like Dale ?One plus point is the performance of James Franco . He worked well alongside Seth Rogan . There is no denying that the combination of Rogan and apatow can produce some very funny dialogue and Pineapple express is no exception. Lines such as ' War is upon you! Prepare to suck the cock of karma! ' and Saul: This is like if that Blue Oyster s**t met that African Kush I had - and they had a baby. And then, meanwhile, that crazy Northern Light stuff I had and the Super Red Espresso Snowflake met and had a baby. And by some miracle, those two babies met and f***d - this would the s**t that they birthed. Dale Denton: -smells the marijuana- Wow. This is the product of baby f***ing.Although this movie is full of clever stuff like this i was still a little disappointed with overall movie.Perhaps I'm all RoganApatowed out ?These guys have to very careful they don't go down the lines of Steve Martin or god forbid the bloody awful Eddie Murphy .They both were once very funny men but are now as hilarious as hemorrhoids. This is definitely no Superbad.6 out of 10",6,2,5,25 November 2008
John Wick: Chapter 2," Reeves is comfortable in Wicks skin
","It's true to say I'm not a big fan of Keanu Reaves. Funnily enough my wife enjoys watching him but I don't think that has anything to do with his acting ability. Despite my reservations , Keanu seems to have hit the bullseye with John Wick. Hit-man John Wick is once again called out of retirement, this time by a former colleague who wants him to repay a debt by killing an Italian crime lord . But when the attempted assassination goes awry, Wick finds himself hunted by an international cabal of killers. I really enjoyed this . It's one of those films that doesn't tax your brain too much and is full on high tempo action. Director Chad Stahelski , who is a stunt coordinator by trade , uses his expertise to give the audience a brilliantly choreographed film . I look forward to the third chapter.",7,0,1,1 June 2017
Annihilation," Another good original from Netflix
","This is a story about a biologist , Lena , who's husband barely returns alive from a secret expedition. She then leads an anthropologist, a surveyor , a linguist , and a psychologist into a mysterious, expanding region called the Shimmer where evolution has taken a twisted turn. The all-female team must uncover the area's monstrous secrets to save Lena's husband and the world.This is another Netflix original movie and another really good film from them . Natalie Portman and Oscar Isaac star and you can see Netflix have not scrimped on the production. This looks absolutely fantastic ( especially in Ultra HD) and the special affects are top notch. This is a cross between Sci Fi and horror and has a really interesting concept. Without giving too much away , inside this Shimmer there are beings that don't just kill any humans that enter , they assimilate with them producing hybred beings. There is one scene with a bear that is really cleverly done.
I really liked this. It crosses genres and rarely disappoints. 
What I also liked is that lot's of horror and Sci-Fi films don't know how to end . This certainly does.",8,0,3,10 April 2018
Spectre," Just as good as Skyfall
","Spectre is another thoroughly entertaining movie that appeals not only to Bond fans but to general movie goers too . There is everything in this you would expect from the Franchise. Great action , a good story , romance and lots of references to previous bond movies. There is also more humour in this than we have seen in the last few films. We also see more of Ben Wishaw as Q which is a good thing. My kids were pleased to see WWE wrestler Dave Bautista as the muscle in the film. If i had to be critical i would say it's probably a little too long and i would like to have seen a little more of Christoph Waltz. There have been a lot of people saying this isn't quite as good as Skyfall but i disagree. I would say it's just as good. I really hope this isn't the last Daniel Craig / Sam Mendes collaboration because between them they seemed to have cracked 007 .",9,11,30,29 October 2015
Joy," Absolutely Terrible
","I absolutely hated this film . So much so it made me angry . I was angry because I cannot for the life of me understand the praise this film has received and why it has received academy award nominations. Why does is a film about a woman who is trying to sell a squeezy mop ever gets made in the first place ? The story really is as dull as it sounds . Duller in fact. I'm not a fan of David O. Russell anyway . Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle were overrated in my opinion but neither were anywhere near as bad as this . If I never see Bradley Cooper and his lopsided face fawning over ' look at me I'm the new Meryl Streep' Jennifer Lawrence again in a movie it will be too soon and what was De Niro playing at ?? Another terrible performance from the once great man. This movie felt like a Sunday afternoon , made for TV flick , that my wife would watch and that I run a mile from. Sickly sweet with sentiment , so much so that you literally feel nauseated watching it. It's amazing that I managed to get to the end of this drivel. It's a bloody mop for Christ sake - Who cares ???

True Romance," True Romance True Brilliance
","'Sicilians are great liars. The best in the world. I'm Sicilian. My father was the world heavy-weight champion of Sicilian liars. From growing up with him I learned the pantomime. There are seventeen different things a guy can do when he lies to give himself away. A guys got seventeen pantomimes. A woman's got twenty, but a guy's got seventeen... but, if you know them, like you know your own face, they beat lie detectors all to hell. Now, what we got here is a little game of show and tell. You don't wanna show me nothing', but you're tellin me everything. I know you know where they are, so tell me before I do some damage you won't walk away from.' The above dialogue is said by Christopher Walken (Vincenzo Coccotti) in what , in my opinion is one of the greatest scenes in modern cinema.The verbal sparring between Walken and Hopper is one of the reasons why i love movies so much, so thanks guys! It's been far too long since i watched this film , 15 years to be precise , and thanks to a little bit of self indulgence i have re equanted myself with the film that is 'True Romance'. Clarence Worley is a well-meaning but socially unskilled comic-shop clerk whose idea of a big night out is catching a Sonny Chiba triple-feature at a downtown grindhouse. Clarence is celebrating his birthday in just such a manner when he meets a beautiful girl named Alabama , and it's love at first sight for both of them. Clarence's enthusiasm isn't dampened much when he discovers Alabama is actually a prostitute who was paid by his boss to bump into him; she's only been in the business for a few days, and is more than eager to give up streetwalking to be with Clarence. However, Alabama is certain her pimp, Drexl ,will not be happy; he's an ill-mannered sort with mob connections and a fondness for violence.Chivalrous Clarence offers to break the news to Drexl and collect her belongings, but he doesn't tell her he also plans to kill Drexl while he's there; a melee breaks out that leaves Drexl and his henchmen dead. Clarence grabs a suitcase that he thinks contains Alabama's clothes, but he discovers it instead holds five million dollars' worth of cocaine. The couple hits the road for California, planning to sell the dope and enjoy the good life in South America with the proceeds, but soon a group of very unhappy underworld characters are after them, as well as the police. It's a rare thing that a group of actors are on top of their game , all at the same time in the same film but when it does happen , you get a film like True Romance. In my opinion Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are perfect in roles as Clarence and Alabama . Slater oozes charm and Arquette could make any man fall on love with her . I think that these two actors put in the best performances of their careers. ( i cant think of anything they have done since that is as good.) .Christopher Walken makes the best ten minute cameo in a film i can think off. he's funny , yet menacing , which in turn has a knock on affect with Dennis Hopper. An actor i don't normally rate that highly , yet in the scenes with Walken he is amazing. There are other good performance from Brad Pitt , Gary Oldman and what looks like a young Tony Soprano from James Gandolfini. Having given all this praise i still think True Romance is far from being perfect. Quentin Tarantino's script is not a polished as we see in later films such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, yet it's undeniably Tarantino . Also i was a little disappointed with the final five minutes of the film especially after THAT monumental shoot up. It's all a bit too 'happy ever after' for my liking. Never the less this is a classic movie and has a special place in my movie watching heart. 9 out of 10",9,1,2,4 June 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," Good but not Danny Boyle's best
","If the title 'Slumdog Millionaire' was mentioned six months ago when discussing Oscar Nomination most people would not have heard of it. Yet Danny Boyle seems to have come from nowhere and won the hearts and minds of many movie goers with this visually stunning movie but do i think it is worthy of it's ten nominations or of winning the best picture Oscar?........... Today is the biggest day in Jamal Malik's life.A penniless, eighteen year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai, he's one question away from winning a staggering 20 million rupees on India's 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?' But when the show breaks for the night, suddenly, he is arrested on suspicion of cheating. After all, how could an uneducated street kid possibly know so much? Determined to get to the bottom of Jamal's story, the jaded Police Inspector spends the night probing Jamal's incredible past, from his riveting tales of the slums where he and his brother Salim survived by their wits to his hair-raising encounters with local gangs to his heartbreak over Latika, the unforgettable girl he loved and lost.Each chapter of Jamal's increasingly layered story reveals where he learned the answers to the shows seemingly impossible quizzes. But one question remains a mystery: what is this young man with no apparent desire for riches really doing on the game show?When the new day dawns and Jamal returns to answer the final question, the Inspector and sixty million viewers are about to find out...I am a bid fan of Danny Boyle . He is an unassuming , humble man that makes great movies with the minimal of fuss and sometimes with very little publicity.Slumdog Millionaire didn't need much publicity because critics loved it and word of mouth has made this film the success it has become.I have to admit , although i really enjoyed this movie i was ever so slightly disappointed with it too.I felt an hour in that it was dragging slightly and that the film lost it's focus and direction a little. I also felt the 'Who wants to be a millionaire ' presenter ,played by Anil Kapoor was way over the top. A little too bollywoodish ( i just made that word up!) for me. Thankfully it came together in the the last half hour and i must admit i had a tear in my eye at the end. There are some great scenes in the film. One where Jamal goes to extremes to get the autograph of his favourite movie star by jumping through the hole in the outside toilet into what lay beneath and then running through a crowd of people covered from head to toe in muck to confront his hero.The other , altogether far more sinister , when Salim watches as the gang blinds his friend just so he can double his begging income. That scene really made me wince.Strangely enough , despite ten Oscar nominations none are for the acting and i think that is because they characters are played by several different people because of the ageing process.Dev Patel does deserve a mention for his performance as does the beautiful Freida Pinto and i really enjoyed the scenes at the railway station in the final credits but they were not quite at the standard to get a best actor or actress Oscar nomination . So we go back to the question ' Is this worthy of winning the best picture Oscar' ?. In my eyes no. But because of past greats such as 'Trainspotting' , 'Shallow Grave' and 'Twenty Eight Weeks Later' , Danny Boyle might just be due one .8 out of 10",8,0,1,25 January 2009
The Nice Guys," This tries way too hard to be Lethal Weapon
",It's been a while since Russell Crowe made a good movie. He's not quite on the Robert De Niro / Al Pacino spiral of stinkers but he's getting there and with The Nice Guys he continues on his own little run of movie dross. This is about a pair of 1970's private detectives who are hired to find a missing girl who is caught up in corruption involving the porn industry and people high up in office. That may sound interesting but believe me it's not. I found the whole plot of this film utterly dull and If that isn't bad enough the chemistry between Reynolds and Crowe was non existent. I didn't laugh once. This film tries so hard to be a Lethal Weapon or a 48 hours and never comes close. This one plus point from this film is 14 year old Angourie Rice who plays the clever kid really well.,4,3,11,11 July 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Annoying as hell
",I never liked the original Mad Max movies which is why I put off watching Fury Road. I finally got around to seeing it and although better than the Mel Gibson films I still didn't like it very much. I can see why this would appeal to people . The action sequences are spectacular and the special affects are top notch but that's just not enough for me. Is a plot too much to ask? I found the constant action irritating and was relieved when there was a rare gap in the ensuing pandemonium . Another irritation is Tom Hardy. He seems to be reviving his rile as Bane ( Dark Knight Rises) by mumbling his lines. Sadly it has been announced that there will be another Mad Max film in a couple of years time. I hope I'm more successful in avoiding that one as I was with this.,4,2,4,30 December 2015

When i first saw this movie i wasn't so sure about it but having revisited it i really do think that this is one of the best movies of all time. What i love about this film is that Ridley Scott made this film look so authentic and mostly thanks to the modern day magic of the blue screen. The scenes of the Colosseum and the gladiatorial fights are the work of a true genius. Of coarse it helps to have a great cast and Russell Crow is the perfect man to play Maximus. His performance is amazing and it leaves you totally believing in everything the Roman did or said. Joaquin Phoenix and Oliver Reed ( who died during the filming of this ) are also fantastic and deserve a great deal of credit for their displays. Gladiator contains one of the most iconic movie scenes of all time - who can forget this ' My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, Commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions, loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife. And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.' Pure dramatic pleasure. If you haven't seen this since 2000 you must see it it again.

The Social Network," It's hard to make a film about geeks Oscar material.
","There is talk of The Social Network being up for quite a few nominations at next years Oscars and while i can appreciate the writing and the acting involved in this film , i cant quite see how this is being talked up for an academy Award. You would think the story of how Facebook evolved would not be the most exhilarating subject for a movie and in a way it's true but it's not a boring film in a way shape or form. It only takes a few geeks and a great idea to make someone a billionaire and they don't even have to be interesting people ( or even nice) and the portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg in this makes him neither of those but what it does show is that when big money starts to be made , friendship goes out of the window and the Lawyers start to make their wedge. There are good performances from Andrew Garfield , Jesse Eisenberg and Justin Timberlake but not enough for this film to get close to winning best picture award. Perhaps it shows what a a poor year it has been for movies if this even gets nominated? It's still worth watching though.

13 Hours," A Michael Bay film you can enjoy at last
","Lets face it , it's very easy criticise Micheal Bay and he's movies. He's made some real stinkers in recent years but credit where credits due , even though 13Hours The Secrets Soldiers of Benghazi is by no means perfect it's not terrible either in fact I quite enjoyed it. This is the true story of the attack on a U.S. embassy outpost in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012, which killed four Americans (including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens) . The bad out of the way first , its 45 minutes too long and it is a little bit flag waving at times but i was impressed the cast , especially John Krasinski who I would never have seen in this role but it works. James Badge Dale and Pablo Schreiber are good too. The special affects are pretty good as well and thankfully not a transformer in sight!. Not bad at all.",7,2,6,18 July 2016
Alien: Covenant," Enough is enough
","I absolutely love the 1979 Alien. When it first came out I was 12 years old and managed to see it on video and it scared the hell out of me and still does. Ridley Scott managed to make a simple yet original film that had everyone on the edge of their seat , so a return to the franchise was much welcome but sadly this is not a patch on Alien. The Covenant is a colony ship that while on it's journey to it's new home finds a much closer and seemingly idyllic planet but when it lands they soon realize that this paradise contains a terrifying threat. It's hard to talk about Alien: Covenant without giving away plot spoilers. There are links to Prometheus and possibly other Alien films but needles to say it starts as you would expect and I must say I enjoyed the first 45 minutes. The trouble is , is that in the middle of this film it loses it way big time. It's starts to get into creationism and even religion and the lines get blurred as to who is the real enemy. The cast didn't do it for me either. There was certainly no Sigourney Weaver to get on side with. It does get some credibility back with the conclusion of the film but to be honest I was quite disappointed.",6,5,16,12 May 2017
The Martian," Underwhelmed
","This about astronaut , Mark Watney , who is left stranded on the Mars after an accident , presumed dead and his fight to survive and ultimately be rescued. Having finally got around seeing The Martian I have to say I was left completely underwhelmed with what I saw. It's absolutely packed full of technical jargon that my eyes glassed over after a while . It's way too long and I was expecting a career defining performance from Matt Damon , having seen other reviews , but it was just Matt Damon being Matt Damon. Nothing new. There is also one of the worst bits of casting I have seen in years and that is Sean Bean as Mitch Henderson . He looks and sounds so out of place , in fact he stumbles through the film looking like he is suffering a massive hangover. This film was definitely not out of this world.",6,6,14,15 December 2015
The Fighter," Rightly compared to the first Rocky film.
","I have now seen all 10 films that are nominated for best picture in the up coming Oscars and although The Fighter is not the best of them it certainly has everything you would want in a film about Boxing. This has been compared to Rocky , for obvious reason and i would agree it's pretty similar to the first two movies and in some respect better. The boxing action is far more realistic than in Rocky and the camera work really does make it feel like it is archive footage. This is the boxing equivalent of The Wrestler and it's certainly comparable. All the talk is of Christian Bales performance but i think that's a little harsh on Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg gives a much more natural performance than Bale , who i think tries a little hard at times. Amy Adams is also very good and this is a far cry from her character in Enchanted. If i had to criticise this film i would say it's a little predictable at times and that the director makes that awful mistake that a lot of Americans do and confuses Irish with British in the final scenes but over all this a very entertaining film. Incidentally of the 10 nominated films for this years Oscars , my favourite is Toy Story 3 but we all know that wont win it.",8,0,1,20 February 2011
Up in the Air," Clooney doing what he does best
","I don't think there is anybody around in 2010 that makes acting look as easy as George Clooney. He oozes charm and it seems any role he takes , he makes it his own. And there lies my problem. Despite the fact that films like Up in the Air , Burn after reading and Michael Clayton are all very good films in their own right , Clooney seems to be the same guy in all of them. There seems to be attempt to change the character in any way , and although some people like Clooney to be the way he is , i for one would love to see him trying something a little different. Ryan has long been contented with his unencumbered lifestyle lived out across America in airports, hotels and rental cars. He can carry all he needs in one wheel-away case; he's a pampered, elite member of every travel loyalty program in existence; and he's close to attaining his lifetime goal of 10 million frequent flier miles-- and yet...Ryan has nothing real to hold onto. When he falls for a simpatico fellow traveler , Ryan's boss , inspired by a young, upstart efficiency expert , threatens to permanently call him in from the road. Faced with the prospect, at once terrifying and exhilarating, of being grounded, Ryan begins to contemplate what it might actually mean to have a home. Up in The Air is an enjoyable movie . I love the way that Ryan's goal in life was to get as many air miles while he dodged any form of commitment and stable lifestyle . I'm friends with a couple of people who are commitmentphobes so it made me laugh to see someone in a movie with the same problem. I enjoyed the performances of the two leading ladies Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick and there is one scene in particular involving Vera Farmiga that will stick in the mind for a while ( Guys , it's 15 minutes into the film!) Over the last couple of months this movie has been banded around as potentially Oscar winning material and although it's a perfectly good film, in my opinion , it's no 'Best Movie' winner .",8,1,4,22 January 2010
