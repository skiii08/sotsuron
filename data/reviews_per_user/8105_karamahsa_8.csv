Blade Runner 2049," A masterpiece
","I'm here to say that this movie is One of the greatest movies of all time
I wanna pick a favorite scene and talk about it but I can't , they're all my favorite.
A masterpiece. Honestly and truly a masterpiece. Villenueve's skillful direction, fantastic performances from Gosling, Ford, Armas, Leto, and Wright, Oscar winning cinematography from Deakins, and the most impeccable art direction I have ever seen combine to make a massive and in my opinion, flawless movie.I became very cautious at the idea of a sequel being made over thirty years after the first film's release. But 2049 understands everything that made its predecessor a classic. The sequel introduces new routes of discussion to the original's themes of humanity, artificial intelligence, class division, and so much more. Most of the characters are new and interesting additions to the series while the ones that return are treated with respect and feel at home in this new movie. The visuals in this film are just as breathtaking today as the original Blade Runner was for audiences back in the '80s.",10,1,12,28 August 2019
The Irishman," asily one of the best movies of the year.
","#TheIrishman was even better than expected. This is an EPIC film, with a distinct feel to it. Scorsese has a lot to say, and a ton of time to say it in. The runtime will discourage some, but these performances are worth every second... Easily one of the best movies of the year.",10,3,11,29 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker
","Currently preparing for the massive amount of hate and backlash I will receive for this review...So, this film floored me. As a Star Wars fan for many years now, this was the best conclusion to this decade-spanning journey that we could have possibly had.The action sequences here are as usual, beautiful to look at as well as the eye-popping visual effects, and it is always a treat to listen to yet another euphoric score by the legendary John Williams, but besides all that, I truly cared about the story. The stakes here felt immense. There were several moments where I was completely unsure of what was going to happen.I don't watch Star Wars for the action or the visuals, or even the music or cinematography. I watch Star Wars for the characters, and over the years, I have gotten to truly love Rey, Finn, Poe, Kylo Ren, and the rest of the gang so, so much.Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an absolute revelation. Filled with gripping performances, awe-inspiring action and visuals, an emotional core, and beautiful technical elements, this is a beautiful way to end such a beloved saga.",10,1,3,22 December 2019
The Aviator," The Aviator
","This was a lot more entertaining and a lot crazier than what I was expecting. The editing was not doing it for me in a lot of cases which I suppose is the point, it makes things feel pretty claustrophobic, but it just felt sloppy at a certain point. This is such a 2004 movie....",7,0,0,22 December 2019
Dunkirk," One of greatest war films
","An instant member of the shortlist of greatest war films, Dunkirk tells of a harrowing evacuation under the direst circumstances.
Besides the yellow-tipped fighters, The German army is never seen or heard. Nolan makes a concerted effort to only refer to the Nazis as 'the enemy'. This is a story, intentionally in a vacuum, about British heroism. With limited dialogue, Nolan creates urgency through brilliant editing and a masterful score.
The performance of all the actors is very very good , Fionn Whitehead great and Excellent , tom hardy is great such as all other actors .",10,0,2,1 September 2019
The King," the king of the year
","#TheKing is a surprisingly effective film, full of great performances. Chalamet is as good as expected he is the king of the year, but it's Joel Edgerton who (almost) steals the show. It showcases what hatred does to someone built for good. It's long (and slow), but it kept me engaged throughout.",9,2,4,29 November 2019
It's a Wonderful Life," film is like no other
","To me, this film is like no other. I do not know any other film which has warmed me with such an immense gratitude for life and all of its ups and downs after watching it. An all-time Christmas Classic, this is James Stewart at his arguable best, depicting the helplessly selfless George Bailey, who throws away all of his ambitions in life to help those around him in their time of need. When he reaches his breaking point and is ready to commit suicide on Christmas Eve, an angel appears to show George how his town and family would have been different, had George had never existed. This darker vision of society shows George just how thankful people really are for all of his good deeds, which causes him to turn his outlook on a head, and realise how valuable life really is, regardless of any setbacks which come in his way. He returns to his family a changed man, and the film ends on the happiest of notes, with the town coming together to help him in his own time of need.",10,2,3,28 August 2019
Marriage Story," Marriage Story
","I hate saying 'I'm at a loss for words' as a cop out when writing reviews but I can't think of a better way to describe my feelings towards this. A dense yet perfect examination of love, what it means to love, what it means to understand, and what it means to feel alive.",10,5,8,22 December 2019
