The Blair Witch Project," Somewhat Entertaining But Certainly Not A 10!
","The Blair Witch Project is entertaining but I found myself wondering about a few things that didn't add up. For instance, these three students are lost, tired, scared out of their minds, but yet they keep video taping seemingly everything. Also, after a day or so , I would think that the lights on the video cameras, battery powered, would have been spent long before the final scenes. Also, losing a certain item (I won't give it away) didn't seem realistic to me. This film was different to say the least. For that it gets a little higher mark from me. It is intense at times but you won't be screaming. Also, the video taping of this film resulted in it being out of focus and shaky throughout the movie. See The Blair Witch Project but don't expect it to live up to the media hype.",7,0,0,4 August 1999

Antz," An innovative piece of work that should not be missed!
","Antz, from Dreamwork pictures, works on every level. The attention to detail is absolutely incredible and the expressions on the characters' faces brought a sense of absolute realism to the film. The political overtones would probably go over the heads of most young teens, but high school and above will love it. The voices were 'right on' with special  performances by Woody Allen as 'Z' a lovable ant who hates his life moving dirt from one place to another. Sharon Stone as Bala is love interest, Gene Hackman as General Mandible. Christopher Walken as Col. Cutter and Danny Glover as Barbados. This is a movie experience that you don't want to miss. See it on the big screen. It will lose something if you rent it at a video store.",8,0,0,17 November 1998
The Sound of Music," The Sound of Music will have you humming its score for months after you see it.
",I first saw The Sound of Music in 'Technirama' which really brought it to life for me. The music is very memorable and the acting of Julie Andrews is great.,8,4,12,29 October 1998
As Good as It Gets," As Good As It Gets is as good as it gets. This movie should have won best picture.
","Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson are magnetic on the screen in this touching film about relationships and true love. You will laugh and cry and love all the characters. For me, it was what Hollywood should be about.",Null,0,0,28 October 1998
Citizen Kane," Orson Wells Is A Director's Director. Just Simply Magnificent!
","I could not take my eyes off this movie. It is visually stunning and filled with creative firsts in filming techniques. Note the story begins with the ending, something that had never been done prior to Citizen Kane. Orson Wells created this masterpiece as director and star. It deserves the best picture of all time award, especially when you consider the year in which it was produced, 1941. Don't miss Citizen Kane!",9,1,2,15 October 1999
12 Angry Men," A must see film by director Sidney Lumet and top knotch performances from Henry Fonda, Ed Begley, E.G. Marshall and Jack Warden.
","This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat as tensions spill over in a jury room. Aside from a brief seen in the beginning of the film, the entire story is told inside the jury room itself. Henry Fonda has often referred to this effort as his favorite and I could not agree more. I've seen 12 Angry Men many times since 1957 when it was first released. It is in black and white which seems to fit the film perfectly. Note the great use of close-ups used by Sidney Lumet. It is truly a classic and I strongly recommend it.",9,0,0,24 October 1998
Full Metal Jacket," Full Metal Jacket is a mixed bag but certainly entertaining!
","Having been through Marine Corp boot camp, I feel quite qualified to comment on this film. The first half deals with the rigors of basic training in Paris Island, North Carolina. Lee Ermey is outstanding as the drill instructor who brings one recruit to the edge. Without giving away a major part of the film, Marines do not have access to any LOADED weapons, unless under very controlled conditions especially in boot camp. The second half of the film becomes forgettable as it shifts to Vietnam. Credible acting and a riveting first half insures a favorable rating from me.",Null,0,0,2 November 1998
Armageddon," So much money for so little enjoyment!
","There was one great part in Armageddon. WHEN IT ENDED! This movie was painful to watch but especially to listen to. Not only is it one of worst movies I've ever seen, but it succeeded in causing me substantial hearing loss in both ears. I finally consented to see this junk at the urging of my teenage kids. Never again. Hollywood, are you listening???? Make movies that make us care about the characters. In this tripe, I didn't care what happened to ANY of them.",Null,0,1,14 January 1999
American Beauty," An Entertaining and Thought Provoking Film That Works!
","American Beauty deals with several family issues and, at times, is not easy to watch. Keven Spacey and Annette Bening give stunning performances as a married couple that have drifted too far apart.  There is some humor sprinkled here and there to give some relief but quickly turns serious again. This movie is totally unpredictable. It has a great script along with a great supporting cast. As you leave the theater, you will be thinking about what you just saw. It does not preach but there are many lessons to be learned from American Beauty.",8,0,0,2 October 1999
Pearl Harbor," It Could Have Been A Great Film But...
","I really looked forward to Pearl Harbor. I just knew that Hollywood, regardless of its past record, would do this monumental day in our countries history justice. Let's be honest folks. This was a cheezy love story first and foremost with the backdrop of December 7th 1941. Yes, the special effects were excellent but they can not save a bad film. The only really good acting is this effort came from Kate Beckinsale. All the big name stars seemed to be going through the motions and in many cases were totally unbelievable in their roles. A usually steady Alec Baldwin and John Voit were average at best. All that money down the drain. Folks, if you want to see a good Pearl Harbor film, see Tora, Tora, Tora. It strives for accuracy and also depicts the Japanese side and what they were thinking at the time. On the other hand, if you like a shallow love story, I suppose Pearl Harbor delivers. Too bad it did not do this tragic event in our history  justice. I can only hope that it helped make young people aware of why they have the freedoms they seem to take for granted today.",Null,0,0,22 June 2001
Flashdance," Flashdance will be remembered for the music and little else.
","Flashdance,starring Jennifer Beals, is a mixed bag to be sure. The score is reason enough to see the film however, the story leaves a lot to be desired. Jennifer Beals, a welder??? I don't think so! Of course that is just her day job. At night, she dances at a local club. I guess the welding job is not that tiring. Anyway, you get the idea. Jennifer's beauty shows through, lighting up the screen in just about every scene. I guess I'm recommending the film. I still find myself humming the title song.",Null,1,2,5 December 1998
Dirty Dancing," Sound Track Excellent! The Film Is Good But Not Great
","If you are in your teens or 20s, this film will probably be one of your favorites. I know my daughter 17 and her friends, 18 and 24 literally loved it.  The sound track  appealed to me because I'm old enough to certainly remember some of the great tunes of that time period. The story is an old one but well acted. Some parts are humorous and others mildly touching. One thing I really could not understand is how a young girl, seemingly with no rhythm, learns complicated dance steps in a few days. The overall rating for this movie is poor but I would give it a 7 out of 10. Somehow it works despite its obvious flaws.",7,0,0,2 January 2001
Gone with the Wind," A well made film showing the effects of the Civil War on wealthy Southerners.
","This epic, though overly long, does capture the horrors of the Civil War. Clark Gable is memorable as Rhett Butler but the film disappointed me with its slow moments and more than a little bit of over-acting. I was not impressed with Vivien Leigh's performance even though Hollywood awarded her an Oscar. I know that this film has received many and varied reviews. I just happen to feel that it doesn't come up to award winning standards. I would hope that all of you rent this movie and check it out. Many people obviously feel it is deserving of the Oscar it received.",6,1,5,31 October 1998
Man on the Moon," An Entertaining Look At The Life Of Andy Kaufman
","Jim Carrey does a nice job in his roll as Andy Kaufman. How much you enjoy it might be directly related to what you thought of the real Andy. It is well acted with an amazing performance by Danny Devito as Kaufman's agent. You will be constantly guessing as to what is really happening and what is a comic scam. Nothing is what it seems which was the genious of Andy Kaufman himself. My tastes are far different in what is funny and what is not, but still I was fascinated by the story of a young man who seemingly had it all but rejected it in favor of doing his own thing. If you liked Andy, this is a 8. If you did not, it will probably still be a 7. The last 20 minutes are really worth waiting for.",7,0,0,29 December 1999
1941," If You Laughed At The Three Stooges, You'll Probably Like 1941
","Unfortunately, I don't like the Three Stooges nor did I like this movie. It is a non-stop journey into the ridiculous. Oh there are a few scenes that made me laugh out loud but certainly not enough to recommend 1941. I have no doubt many will love this movie but I have a hunch many more will not. Why not try It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, World? If you like slapstick comedy, that is the movie to rent.",4,2,5,18 November 1999
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," The Lost World is a LOST CAUSE!
",I was not expecting The Lost World to be as good as the original. Most follow up films are not. But this was not even close! Jeff Goldblum's performance leaves a lot to be desired compared to the original thriller. The only acting triumph was Vanessa Lee Chester as Dr. Malcolm's daughter. Do yourself a favor and pass this one up folks!,5,0,1,2 November 1998
Good Will Hunting," A combination of fine acting, great script, and great direction.
","Good Will Hunting is an extremely well done film that tells the story of a gifted genius who has suffered abuse as a child. A well meaning professor tries to help by contacting an old school friend, Robin Williams. The relationship between Matt Damon's character and that of Robin Williams is a pleasure to watch unfold. Minnie Driver is excellent as a young college student who loves Will despite his many emotional problems. Very close to being rated a 10 in my opinion. I certainly recommend it highly.",9,2,6,12 December 1998
Patton," The outstanding performance of George C. Scott is reason enough to see this WWII epic.
","It was no surprise to me that George C. Scott won an Academy Award for his portrayal of General Patton The film is long and, at times, slow but you are taken in by Scott's performance. If you like War movies, this must rank as certainly above average and worth the time to see.By the way, note the 1948 Packard staff car driving Patton around in a film that is depicting 1943.Don't let this lack of attention to detail stop you from renting Patton.",8,0,3,26 October 1998
Mulholland Drive," What The Hell Was That All About?
","If you've ever seen David Lynch interviewed, the fact that he is a little 'off the wall' is quite evident. This film , for some odd reason, keeps you involved all the time. You will think it will all come together at the end and that everything will be explained and become clear to you. Wrong!  I can guarantee you that nothing will make sense when you leave the theatre. Saying that, I could not help but be captivated at the unusual. Characters came and went which made no sense but you are sure   everything will make sense by the end of the movie. Wrong!  I can't recommend the film even though David Lynch is one of my favorite directors. He writes like he thinks and it is totally confusing at times. To me, a movie must make some kind of sense. Otherwise you are looking at art that prompts you to guess. Not my idea deal of a fullfilling evening.",5,0,1,14 October 2001
A Bug's Life," Disney's Pixar Animation Studio has produced another classic film for kids and grown-ups alike!
","If there is even a sliver of kid in you at all, you are going to love 'A Bugs Life'. It is every bit an equal to ANTZ but is a little more geared to children. Even so, I'm 58 and loved every minute of it. Special credit goes to Kevin Spacy who IS Hopper, the head grasshopper out to blackmail a colony of gentle ants. Dave Foley as Flik, Julia Louis Dreyfus as princess Atta, Phyllis Diller as Queen,and Edie McClurg as Dr. Flora. All the characters were absolutely enchanting created with state of the art animation that will amaze you. Take your children for sure. If you don't have children, take yourself as soon as possible. Oh, and stay for the credits at the end. You will experience a surprise and maybe a first. You will also enjoy Randy Newman's theme song after the end of the movie.What more could a movie-goer want??",Null,0,0,29 November 1998
Rudy," Even Though Predictable, You Will Love This Film!
","I found RUDY a very entertaining film despite it's predictable ending. The acting was so good and the characters well developed that knowing how it will end won't really matter. If you liked October Sky or Billy Elliot, two films about following your dreams, then you will love RUDY as well.",8,1,4,27 January 2001
For Love of the Game," For Love Of The Game Is Batting 750 In My Book
","Kevin Costner's natural ability on a baseball diamond brings realism to For Love Of The Game, the story of an aging pitcher for the Tigers who suffers from a sore arm, the thought of being traded, and a rocky love relationship that is on again, off again at best.This is a love story first folks and a baseball story added in throughout the film. Early on, there are  moments that are overly dramtic and downright soupy at times but if you can get through the first hour, you will be rewarded with some touching scenes. The supporting cast of Jena Malone Kelly Preston and John C. Reilly are totally believable in their respect roles which saves the movie from being dropped into a below average status, in my opinion. Vince Scully, the voice currently of the L.A. Dodgers, adds drama throughout the movie as the play by play announcer. Cinematography and editing are outstanding and give us the feeling of actually being on the field at Yankee Stadium.  If you like a serious love story you will really enjoy this effort. If you love baseball, that would be an added bonus.",7,0,0,17 September 1999
Toy Story," A movie for the kid in all of us!
","A breakthrough in computer technology brings us one of the finest films ever made for kids and adults alike. It is the story of friendship,and loyalty as a small boys favorite toy (Woody) the voice of Tom Hanks, feels saddened by the arrival of a new birthday present.  You will be amazed at the computer graphics and the attention to detail in facial expressions and background scenery. Every child and grown up should see Toy Story.By the way, Mr. Potato Head is fun, voiced by Don Rickles.",Null,1,1,31 October 1998
Toy Story 2," Toy Story 2 Not Quite As Good As The Original
","Toy Story 2 is action filled throughout and offers more impressive computer animation than the original, but the touching moments are few and far between. A few more characters have been added to the cast of Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog and Rex , that do add to the fun. Kids will, no doubt, love this movie as many scenes play like a video game. Fast and loud. As an adult, I really wanted more meaningful dialog but still, Toy Story 2 scores a 7 with me.",7,0,1,6 December 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," It Was Not Predictable But Was Certainly A Disappointment!
","Eyes Wide Shut is a mixed bag of good and bad. The one thing it has going for it is that you will not be able to predict the ending. Speaking of the ending, it left me wanting more. This is an often unbelievable story of a man's journey into to a sexual adventure that becomes his worst nightmare. Cruise, was not at his best, as a young doctor with a lovely wife and daughter. His practice is successful and he and his wife get invited to a party in which they go their separate ways. Kindman does a great job as the doctor's wife who is also having sexual thoughts of her own. I must say it kept my interest though you will have to wait a while for things to develop and go somewhere. The bottom line is that this is a toss up. Some will like it and others will get up and walk out of the theatre before the ending of the film. Though not a sexual turn on to me, others might feel that it goes a bit too far. They would be wrong, in my opinion.",7,0,0,26 July 1999
Titanic," Titanic is a special effect wonder but that's all.
","Why 'As Good As It Gets' did not win for best picture over Titanic is beyond me. Titanic is, at best, an average movie but some pretty impressive special effects. The story, however, is not believable and nor are the characters. I found it too long and lacking character development. I would advise everyone to see it but don't expect it to be up to its Best Picture Award.",Null,1,3,26 October 1998
The Green Mile," Stunning Performances Make This A Must See Film!
","The real reason to see The Green Mile is to sit and watch simply amazing performances by the entire cast, but especially the work of Tom Hanks, David Morse and Michael Duncan.  The story explores good and evil in a special way that might seem a bit over the top for some.  I personally felt that this film would have been even better had the super natural aspect been eliminated. Still, my interest held throughout the 3 hour playing time. Tom Hanks and David Morse play two prison guards who treat the prisoners awaiting death in a Depression Era southern prison with respect and kindness.  Michael Duncan is magnificent as a black man convicted of killing two white girls.  Don't miss this one folks. Oh, by the way, you will need about 5 Kleenex. Take my word for that.",8,0,0,1 January 2000
Kingpin," A belly laugh movie if there ever was one. Don't miss it.
","Kingpin is one of those films that will be loved by some and hated by others, similar to Ace Ventura Pet Detective. A well respected reviewer, that I usually always agree with, gave this movie an extremely low rating. All this being said, don't miss it. Bill Murray's performance alone is worth the price of admission. I laughed all through Kingpin and I think you will too.",Null,0,0,15 January 1999
Stalag 17," Very Good Movie But Not A Ten
","I really enjoyed Stalag 17, seeing it several times on the big screen back in the 50s. William Holden is excellent as Septon. Otto Preminger and Peter Graves are cast perfectly, but this film tries to be a comedy and a serious drama all rolled into one.  Still, Stalag 17 is very entertaining and the inspiration of Hogan's Heros, still a popular sit-com in reruns. I gave it a strong 7.",7,2,4,11 March 2000
Shrek," Entertaining For Youngsters And Old Folks Too!
","I watched Shrek for the first time on video and certainly would recommend it. However, it is not without some flaws.  It starts out with one hilarious moment after another but then settles into  a simple story of two friends, Shrek , voiced by Mike Myers and his new found friend the donkey voiced by Eddie Murphy going on a journey to rescue a lovely maiden stuck in a castle guarded by a fire breathing dragon.   Murphy really stands out and has most of the funny lines.John Lithgow is the voice for Prince Farkward, a power hundred midget with a mean personality.  The music was an odd mix of oldies and newer rock tunes. Not effective for me but then I'm an old timer myself. I would not hesitate to take children over the age of 8. No younger! Some scenes would be scary for young children. Still, Shrek has some tender moments too and some worthwhile lessons about life. I recommend it but wished  for a little more.",7,0,0,20 November 2001
Mr. Holland's Opus," Richard Dreyfuss is perfect for this role. It is a moving story of dedication and love.
","Richard Dreyfuss plays a musician, Glenne Headly, who takes, what he thought would be, a temporary job as a high school music teacher. For the next thirty years he encourages his students to love music as he loves music. His dedication, however, carries with it a toll on his own family. It is a moving story that will stay with you for a long time. One of Richard Dreyfuss' finest moments on film.",8,8,16,25 November 1998
The Sixth Sense," The Sixth Sense Is Entertainment At Its Best!
","The Sixth Sense is difficult to put into a certain catagory. Scary yes, but there is much more to this film than having your hair stand on end. We feel a little boys fear as he must deal with the fact that he sees, and is tormented by the dead. Malcolm Crowe, played well by Bruce Willis, considers it a quest to help the boy. Toni Collette co-stars as Lynn Sear, the boys mother but it's Haley Joel Osment who steals this movie playing Cole Sear, a boy with a 'sixth sense.' A little slow at the beginning in an effort to develop the characters, but you won't have to wait long for some tense, terror filled moments that will have your skin crawling. This is NOT a film for kids under 14 years of age, in my opinion.",8,0,0,29 October 1999
The Thin Red Line," A War Epic That Could Have Been Much More Effective!
","I recommend The Thin Red Line, however, while I think it is worth seeing, it has several flaws that should be noted. The movie is too long. Simply put, this epic seems to go on and on like the Energizer Bunny. The characters were developed well enough but I found myself not caring about them. The narration was hard to understand in content and the flash-backs didn't really seem to add to the films overall objective. The photography was stunning and the battle scenes realistic, but you are going to be getting up several times in this movie to do whatever just from sitting too long. Again, I recommend it but don't expect it to be another Saving Private Ryan experience. One thing though it does have in common with Saving Private Ryan. It does not glorify war but rather shows soldiers facing fear as they come up against overwhelming odds in battle.",7,1,2,11 July 1999
Gladiator," A Mixed Bag But Ultimately Worth Seeing
","The Gladiator was a disappointment to me personally. I wanted the story to be more believable and I wanted to care more for the characters. This is not to say that this effort is not worth seeing. Richard Harris and Russell Crow give excellent performances. The overall look of the period was captured well however the battle scenes, while intense, were so chopped up, one would think the editor, Pietro DiGiamimo had drank too much coffee. The quick camera work along with chopped editing actually made me dizzy. A mixed bag for me but this film should  appeal to those who like epic, action thrillers. Though a bit too long, there is enough action to make it bearable.",7,0,0,12 May 2000
High Fidelity," If You Like Character Driven Films, High Fidelity Is Loaded With Some Great Ones!
","This film explores the love life of Rob Gordon played by John Cusack. The script is outstanding, the acting superb, and the characters are endearing. It's style will remind you a little of Ferris Buellers Day Off in that Cusack is constantly talking to the camera. It works! You feel Rob's frustrations as his love life seems to be falling apart at the seams. You will enjoy this two hours and you will also laugh and smile a lot throughout the movie. Love is a beautiful thing when it all comes together.",10,0,1,15 April 2000
