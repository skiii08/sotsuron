The Ring," scary stuff - plot holes or no!
","By reading the comments on this film, it occurs to me once again how diverse is human reaction to the same stimulus. Apparently many didn't find The Ring frightening at all - a response I have to believe but find utterly unfathomable. My husband and I saw this film in a packed theatre (yes, with many teenagers), and it was one of those intense audience experiences in which you can almost hear everyone breathe (or not) at the same time. Movie snobs (and my god, there are a lot of you out there! I'm sick of reading 'another poor American version of a brilliant foreign original') and cynics might go to this movie determined not to be frightened by it simply because others said they were, but I think the vast majority of filmgoers would (and do) find this movie effective and disturbing.  Does it make perfect sense? No, but I can honestly say it's been only in retrospect that I've been concerned about discrepancies and ambiguities; while it was going on, I had to keep reminding myself that this was just a movie . . . So, I guess my final word is, It's just an entertainment, for crying out loud! And entertain it does - if you let yourself enter into the film's nightmare world.",Null,0,0,5 November 2002
The English Patient," The gold standard
","It's a rather late date to be commenting on The English Patient, but here goes . . . This film inspires in me the kind of blind admiration I usually loathe.  I find I can respectfully disagree with someone about any film but this.  Some unreasonable part of me rejects as an idiot anyone who doesn't like this movie (painful when it involves family members, but there you are); obviously I'm not alone in this, as the Seinfeld episode makes clear: it is the kind of thing you break up with someone over (luckily my husband loved it, too). OK, this is a bit of an exaggeration, but not by much.  It is the sheer artistic cohesiveness and depth of it. Every element is amazing: the screenplay (of a nearly impossible-to-follow novel), the directing, the acting, the cinematography, the score . . . nothing is as it seems, which is just the point. I never watch it without seeing some new detail which both echoes and elaborates on one of the many themes and images which are so intricately wound throughout.  It is that rarest of film achievement: a work of art.  I judge every subsequent film by how it compares to the overall achievement of The English Patient; no winners so far.  The critic for The New Yorker at the time of the film's release(not sure if it was David Denby or Anthony Lane) summed up my feeling exactly: a masterpiece.",10,7,12,3 March 2001
Lost in Translation," So disappointing
","Like many others here, I went to this movie prepared to like it. I liked the premise, I enjoy 'small' films, and I like Bill Murray, especially in off-beat pieces like Rushmore. Sadly, I came away with the feeling that, yes, it might be a bittersweet little interlude between these two characters and would be deeply affecting if it were happening to YOU. Unfortunately, it's not so riveting when you're watching it happen on screen (movies usually benefit from a plot). One is supposed to feel sorry for Charlotte who's extremely sensitive, thoughtful, and well-educated yet never manages to string two sentences together. Aside from an Evelyn Waugh allusion, there's no hint that Charlotte is intelligent yet alone educated. Her only real talent is sitting around her room in her underwear looking bored. The whole middle section of the movie - the Tokyo nightlife part - seemed an absolute waste to me. I would much rather have seen these characters actually conversing and interacting than being in one loud confusing scene after another. Like shots of neon signs and traffic? Then this is the film for you. As a side note, why is the opening shot one of Charlotte's sheer underwear clad butt? If it's a symbol, I missed its significance. One last item: is it only me, or did the whole thing seem condescending (borderline insulting) to the Japanese?",Null,0,0,11 January 2004
The Devil Wears Prada," Having it both ways
","Oh, what a seductive little cheat this movie was. From the title, one obviously expects a little Faustian morality tale about the seductive lure of the superficial (but gorgeous!), and at one level, that's what you get. Unfortunately, like movies whose ostensible point is to condemn violence by tossing in titillating heaps of it, The Devil Wears Prada whorishly revels in the world it satirizes. It hits many girls where they live (beautiful clothes, cool make-overs, etc.)and at the same time asks them to please reject it all. Let's consider our heroine. We can't have her REALLY go over to the dark side,even a little, can we? She'll discover how good she can look with a new haircut and nifty Chanel thigh-highs (and, oh, she does look good). She'll get to go to Paris, too (hey, we'd looooove to see Fashion Week there)-- and not by just selfishly accepting the offer at the expense of her colleague. Heck no. Said colleague will get hit by a car. SHE's in no shape for Paris, so why shouldn't Andy go? She also gets to have some kissing-under-the-lamppost,postcardy ooh-la-la with Simon Baker and still not cheat on her doting boyfriend (they were conveniently 'on a break,' so no-harm, no-foul sort of deal). Clothes, Paris, extracurricular sex, and . . . how does it all end? Right back where it started. Our heroine gets the high ground and gets to enjoy the low ground, too. And our 'devil' of the title? Bitch or Mistress of the Universe? She has it both ways as well. We're meant to deplore and laugh at her high-handed ridiculousness, yet admire her for just doing what it takes to be a success in a man's world. So ultimately how are we supposed to feel about Andy's excursion into the fashion world? Superior, I suppose. And a little used.",Null,0,1,15 February 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Better the second time around
","Just some thoughts on the film after a second viewing . . . As others have indicated here, the film takes two viewings to appreciate. Like many Tolkien fans, my expectations and anticipation are too high the first time around. The scale of the film is so huge, there is just too much to take in. As with FOTR, I think I'll like it more each time I see it. Another thought occurs after seeing Gangs of New York . . . the 'historicity' of Peter Jackson's Middle-earth is more believable than the 'real' history of Civil War-era NYC (operatic stylistic excesses taken into account). Another telling point (well, probably just tells about ME, but . . .): As I was returning from the restroom about an hour into Gangs, I had the overwhelming urge to ditch the whole thing and duck into the other theatre showing TTT. So kudos to Jackson for making it authentic to a past that never existed; there are sooo many ways he could have screwed this up . . . Let's make Merry a girl . . . let's pare this Fellowship down to some manageable numbers . . . let's change the names of Saruman and Sauron (too similar for the average viewer) . . . Ye gad. Let's just be thankful for what we have!",Null,0,0,29 December 2002
Moulin Rouge!," crack-fueled claptrap
","O.K., this one hurt - my ears, my eyes, my intelligence . . . Five minutes into it, you've pretty much seen it.  My husband and I did, however, stick it out to the end because his sister had told us we would love it.  As a matter of fact, she said it would break her heart if we didn't.  Oh boy.  We just put off mentioning we had seen it as long as we could.  Apparently, this film causes a visceral love/hate reaction in viewers, and obviously, we didn't fall into the 'love' category.  I admire the idea and the effort but was numbed by the product--a triumph of editing and sound, I guess, but all to an incredibly annoying result.  Mostly I just wanted it to STOP. What astounds me is that the score has won two major awards already!!! I realize there are some original things in it, but surely that is not what sticks in one's memory.  I like Ewan McGregor and can tolerate Nicole Kidman (though the 'wronged woman making an valiant comeback' schtick is getting old). Even though I hated it, some other people think it's really swell, so I'm loathe to say don't see it.  Just don't say you weren't warned!",Null,4,8,21 January 2002
Prisoners," Winner: Worst Police Work on Film
","Spoilers ahead. Not that it matters.Oh my, what a waste of top talent and resources. This could have been a taut, effective, thoughtful little thriller, but the ridiculous plot holes and logical inconsistencies doom it (along with its unnecessary length). The Hugh Jackman character is such a glaring box-checking conceit that it diminishes any complexity I'm pretty sure we're MEANT to appreciate about him. Religious? Check. Hard-working common man? Check. Struggling in these dire economic times? Check. Adorable, loving family? Check. Tragic family event in past that molded his character? Check. Ironic plot development? Check. (The doomsday prepper gets burned; but wait, that whistle did come in handy, as we knew it would.) OK, let's stop there. I'm not saying the plight of the parents was not moving. Who is not moved by children in jeopardy, parents in misery? It's difficult to not see plots like this in terms of the basest exploitation. But it takes a sure and subtle hand to make it work, and that was obviously missing here. Many have compared it to Mystic River, which is apt, though that was a far finer film, and more believable as a police procedural. I imagine the screenwriter and director wanted us to take a hard look at what might happen when a good man goes bad for all the right reasons, but the lengths he goes to in torturing the Paul Dano character just don't make sense. Yes, maybe that's the point: Keller is beyond 'sense.' OK, but when the two other parents acquiesce to the torture (albeit somewhat reluctantly, but still), I wanted to throw something at the screen.While I'm still on 'character,' Jake Gyllenhaal's detective is an absolute cipher. Maybe this was a decision NOT to give him a backstory of any kind because that would be lame. Fine. But in place of that we get a bad haircut, shirt-buttoned-all-the-way-but-no-tie look, some twitchy blinking, and not much else. I was rooting for him mostly because he wasn't actively torturing anyone.Other complaints:*One detective seems to be assigned to this very explosive case. Other than combing the fields for bodies, no one else seems involved in the 'investigation.' OK, this was probably a decision so the focus would be on Loki (his name,really?) and not on some partner chitchat, and at a 2 hr., 33 min. runtime, I should shut up about it, but it so goes against any police reality, that I couldn't forgive it. *Gyllenhaal makes a decision pretty early that the Paul Dano character is innocent, and so he is released - without surveillance and without police protection, even though Jackman's character has already attacked him. Yes, I know, some perfunctory BS scene with Gyllenhaal's superior was included to explain why there was no surveillance, but that also was stupid. He was their only real suspect. And a search of his aunt's property didn't reveal . . . drugs, syringes, handguns, sedated girls? Nobody looked into the history of this little 'farmily'? The aunt is taken at her word about everything. Oh wait . . . she had to be, or Hugh Jackman could not have kidnapped Paul Dano and we wouldn't have a movie.*The priest has a dead body in the basement. Obviously, he takes his vow about confessions more seriously than the commandment about murder. Oh, and that dead body turns out to be . . . Well, you know if you saw it.*The abandoned apartment where Dano is held is never searched (convenient new suspect emerges at critical juncture, too busy to send someone else over there to do a thorough search).*Red herring to end all red herrings: deranged young man with mazes, snakes, pig blood, buried mannequins, stolen children's clothing. *Just in general: too much crazy in too limited a geographical space (see Priest, Snake Boy, Crazy Aunt).*One child escapes . . . while heavily sedated? Crazy aunt nonetheless stays put, does not kill remaining child immediately. Why she was keeping them alive in the first place is not convincingly explained.*ONE person deciding that a dead child means warring with God and creating 'demons' by abducting and killing other people's children is a just response to personal tragedy is far-fetched (not impossible, certainly), but TWO! Good times. Of course, the Man suffers a crisis of conscience apparently and confesses to the wrong priest. The Woman (female of the species and all that) has to keep muddling along, killing when she gets a chance. Times are tough (the recession applies to child abduction too). *The maze symbol is both too obvious (morally) and too opaque. Dead guy in basement wearing one, crazy crime re-enactor draws them, imprisoned Dano whispers it? Connection unclear.I wish I had that whistle at the end, so someone would have come and saved me from this movie.",2,82,156,23 January 2014
From Hell," Non-scary nonsense
","First of all, I wasn't expecting a 'great' film. It got average to poor reviews and certainly wasn't on my must-see list.  Still, I hoped it might be a little atmospheric, spooky diversion.  Sadly, no. I'd imagine you have to work pretty hard to make the Ripper story NOT scary, but the Hughes brothers manage it.  First of all, as another viewer noted, this particular take on the story has been done (and better) in Murder by Decree.  I suppose you have to credit the boldness (?) of any film that suggests that Queen Victoria was involved in a murder conspiracy, but it really just comes off as a cheap bit of class vindictiveness. She represents everything that is oppressive and wrong in that society, right? So it only follows that she wouldn't stop at a bit of homicide.  Ye gad.  Another minor (yet distracting) detail is the color of Heather Graham's hair.  I couldn't decide if they were trying to make her appear more 'Irish,' or if that stunningly unnatural color was meant to look like just that (colored to attract customers?). My fear was that someone in makeup thought this looked appropriate, or heaven help us, 'real.'  Implicating the Masons in murderous rituals is a nice touch, too; maybe they can replace Nazis as the one group filmmakers can villify without repercussion. Sigh.  All woefully inept at every level.",Null,1,2,14 June 2002
Identity," Campy fun? Slasher movie?
","What a disappointment! So much talent in the service of so little. The film is never really scary or involving, although there are some cheap, manipulated thrills to be had. Many have praised the end, which I won't reveal here, but it felt more contrived than shocking--we even have the cliche of the 'false' ending again (just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water . . .).  Thanks goodness John Cusack was in it; no wait, I'm sorry John Cusack was in it.",Null,0,0,26 April 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," There are 'movies' and then there is LOTR
","I admit I have an irrational fondness for these films, loving them more each time I see them. I know others here have said this, but if you've only seen ROTK once, go again. There's too much to absorb on first viewing. I've seen it several times, each time in a large, filled or nearly filled theatre, and I think it speaks to the power of the filmmaking and the story that I marvel each time at how little squirming, shuffling, and sighing there is for such a long movie. Granted, there are people who hate the ending(s), but again, on second viewing, it feels right and deserved. I'm sad only that there won't be another one to look forward to next December.",10,1,2,4 January 2004
