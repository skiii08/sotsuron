The Incredible Hulk," Mediocre
","This is the marvel movie that marvel longs to forget. I however do not understand why. This movie felt like any other superhero movie and like other superhero movies always seems to have the same faults. This movie, like other Marvel movies, has a problem with its villain. The villain is lazily thrown in there and comes out of nowhere. It turned one of the military men who are chasing after The Hulk into another huge green monster with little explanation as to why. The villain did not have really any character development and as a result, it was hard to feel an accomplishment from the overcoming of the villain.One thing that Marvel movies usually exceed at are fight scenes and this movie is not any different. In short Hulk is a beast that pretty much destroys everything he touches and it is very visual pleasing. It was entertaining.I can see why Marvel might be a little embarrassed by this movie, but there is no real reason to almost completely ignore it as a whole. Sure it has it's flaws, but overall was an entertaining film to pass the time. With overall decent acting and exciting action, I would recommend this MCU movie just so to have experienced it at least once.",6,0,0,21 May 2018
