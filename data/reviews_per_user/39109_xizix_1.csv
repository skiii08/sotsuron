10 Cloverfield Lane," A brush with greatness
",Could have been an amazing psycho drama. Ruined by the script (ending). Perhaps lack of trust for the younger actors. However first half proves they would pull that off. Amazing performance all around. Why would you go that way at the end?,6,0,0,12 April 2020
