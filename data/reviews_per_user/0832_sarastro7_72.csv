The Mask," Superlative superhero comedy
","Being a superhero comics reader, I tend to see The Mask primarily as a superhero movie. When I look at the best superhero movies yet made, the list of really good ones is quite short. The first X-Men movie was good, the Spider-Man movies are decent, and the best of the lot may be Mystery Men. I also like Sky High. But, one I frequently forget to consider is The Mask. It is actually just as good as Mystery Men, and so one of the two best superhero movies yet. It is a total comedy classic, also in terms of Jim Carrey's acting. Everything is done perfectly and for reasons that make sense to the plot, and it's just fantastically funny: 'I can explain everything!!' 'Explain THIS!' 'Ummmmm....'Taking its cues from Tex Avery cartoon is genius, and complementing everything with superb (for the time) special effects that still hold up today is just brilliant. This movie has it all, and it all gels in perfect hyper-slapstick harmony. The story is cool, the acting and casting are inspired, and Cameron Diaz is pitiably innocent and adorable.A fine, fine piece of movie-making.9 out of 10.",10,11,12,26 October 2008
Alien 3," Trainwreck or not? Not an easy decision, but the answer is: Trainwreck
","I never used to flat-out hate Alien 3, but I was never a huge fan of it, either. Of course, both Alien and Aliens are perfect 10s, while Alien 3 deviates from the course of excellence. It had many problems, chief of which was the way it continued and yet did not continue from the previous film. If Hollywood wants to do a continuation, they should do a continuation, instead of making a movie that really stands alone, but has a misplaced reference to continuity between the two movies ungracefully inserted. That's a very inconsistent, half-assed and frankly shitty way to present a movie to devoted audiences.However, I did watch Alien 3 several times up through the last 12 years, and seemed to like it better and better each time. I was starting to convince - I mean fool - myself that it was a wholesome stylistic exercise and experience.Then the Director's Cut came out. A friend of mine characterizes it as 'different, but not better or worse. Just different'. We have a longer and infinitely more well-rounded story, with a completely different opening (Ripley having been flung out of the EEV, and the chest-burster having infected an ox - not a dog), and much, much bigger roles for the inmates at the penal colony. Finally, there is a reason for the story to be set in a prison. And there's much more human drama, and it's quite well-made.But. There's a big 'but'. It is stylistically well done, but it just doesn't work very well. It's not a terribly interesting story. The whole thing reeks of a bad idea that has nothing much to do with sci-fi *or* aliens - or anything else. One doesn't really care about the characters. Sigourney Weaver and Charles Dance both do a good job in their roles, but the story is just not substantial. Where are the overtones and the subtext; the symbolism? What is the movie saying? Not much.All the Director's Cut has accomplished for me is to demonstrate how enormously empty the theatrical version was, and replaced it with something that indeed is not better, just different. One cannot call the Director's Cut worse, because the story is much more coherent and wholesome. It just isn't of much interest.I am sad to say that I have now lost the mild appreciation I used to have for Alien 3. I used to rate it a 6 out of 10, but now, in the realization that it really is quite a bad movie, I have to revise that rating to a 4. *Sigh!*",4,403,421,30 January 2005
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Total nonsense - a ridiculous excuse for a movie.
","I guess I have only myself to blame, but I watched this (mainly to look at Milla, although I should mention that I am a huge sci-fi fan, but knew going in that this would almost certainly be an awful example of that genre), and it was a whole new magnitude of nonsense. I was sure it couldn't be worse than the 3rd movie (which I generously rated a 2 out of 10), but it was.***SPOILERS BELOW!***This movie was the greatest potpourri of nonsense I have ever witnessed. Big plot elements of nonsense, steeped in little details of nonsense. The details are too numerous to mention, but here are a few of the howlers: First a bunch of Alice clones attack an Umbrella facility, and we never hear who sent them: Nonsense. These apparently have telekinetic powers, although only the last of the clones actually use them: Nonsense. The bad guy then self-destructs the facility, in the process *nuking all of Tokyo*!!: Nonsense. For no reason that is explained, the real Alice is aboard the escape chopper: Nonsense. She is turned human again, and seconds later mysteriously survive an explosive high-speed crash: Nonsense. The Umbrella corporation broadcasts a message leading survivors to one of their last secret bases: Nonsense. When our stalwart band get there, they first realize it's a trap and then promptly walk into it: Nonsense. Then they revive all the people there although they have no food or other resources and the entire world is a zombie deathtrap: Nonsense.I could go on. Did I mention this movie is a bunch of nonsense? Of course, every scene and concept in it is utterly derivative, too. This writer/director, who is now forever barred from earning the tiniest smidgeon of respect from me, has achieved total suspension of belief. It is anti-art. Horrid, awful and contemptible in every way that matters. Absolutely the worst of the worst of meaningless commercial sewage. Crapdrivel.1 out of 10.",1,4,10,11 November 2010
Deja Vu," Too cunning to be understood - almost
","Oh dear. Time-travel movies. Most of the time they have some fatal flaw in their logic, and at first I thought that Deja Vu did, too. But apparently it doesn't. Only problem is, on first viewing it's nearly impossible for mortal intellects to understand, and even harder to explain.When the movie starts, another earlier timeline has already played itself out. Claire's phone message for Doug could only have come if he had already gotten involved in her life. So what we don't see in the movie is the first time he goes back in time to save her. He doesn't succeed, and so we get a second (actually a third) timeline, where we follow the 'third Doug's' point of view, meaning that neither he nor we know the whole story. It's a plot much like in Christopher Nolan's Memento. Doug has to discover his mistakes over and over until he gets it right. Trouble is, the movie doesn't show you this with enough clarity for the ordinary (or even a bit advanced) viewer (or critic) to understand. There are not enough clues. It's being too steenkin' intellectual! But, this is forgivable; I always like a movie that doesn't give away all its secrets at once. The downside is that it will not be a commercial or critical success, at least not until posterity as a whole figures out what's going on in it. But to have a decent time-travel movie for once, I do think it's worth it! (And hey, don't movies take in most of their cash on DVD sales anyway?)So I must say that, after thinking about it, it's actually a much better movie than I thought it was just after I finished it. This is good. Discovering surprising depths to a Hollywood movie is very, very rare. Good job, everybody who worked on it. You did well.9 out of 10.",9,1,2,8 January 2007
Star Trek," Not bad, not bad...
","I was a bit skeptical, but I must admit this is a fine movie. We may even have a classic on our hands. The references to the original Trek are so sweeping that any Trekkie can't help but be thoroughly entertained. While the story is fairly weak and we don't really get into Nero's motivation, the production values are the best we've seen in a Star Trek movie yet. And the really big strength of this production is the characters. I'll just say it: They're all great! Good acting, good dialog, flawless character dynamics. Kirk, McCoy and Scotty are good, Uhura is superb and delectable, Chekov is funny and endearing, Sulu is utterly cool and Spock is simply spectacularly good! Get this crew into a TV series NOW! I'll pre-order the DVDs!Still. This isn't *really* new. Paramount was not brave enough to do a continuation of the original Trek, but thought they had to regurgitate the old characters in order to succeed. Well, maybe - I guess we'll never know. But it's still a nostalgia trip more than it's innovative science fiction. Also, again, the story is weak. Exploding planets and supernovas. Yeah, yeah. They put that in there because they think that's the kind of thing you put into sci-fi movies. It's 'big'! But without a good story, it's not big at all. What the heck is 'red matter'? No explanation. Oh well. This is, I guess, par for the course. Most Trek movies, or sci-fi movies, don't have great stories. We'll survive.But, apart from the story, I do have one serious gripe which, sadly, I've heard no one else even mention: Where's Roddenberry's Utopian society? We don't hear squat about it!! In the original series, Kirk's whole dynamic was about how poorly he fit into the Utopian society of his day, and how this drove him to be a space adventurer. If you want to, you can take this as being implicit in the new movie as well, but we don't hear a single detail about the nature of this future society, or the ideals of the Federation. It's as if Roddenberry's vision of a better future has been surgically, if not excised, then certainly ignored. As a utopianist myself, this bugs me. If we don't have the idealism of the background setting as part of this universe, then it's not a model for a better world, and then the characters are not all that heroic. This way, their actions matter a lot less. The big picture is not part of the picture. Well. Since the movie doesn't show anything, it still might be there. We'll have to see if it is included in the subsequent movies or TV series. I really hope so.So. My rating of the new Star Trek is this: Subtract one star because it is a regurgitation of something old. And subtract another because the Utopian aspect is missing. Otherwise, very enjoyable movie. Good stuff.8 out of 10.",10,4,13,8 May 2009
Underworld," Can't wait for the sequel!
","I have just watched Underworld for the second time, and I was gratified to discover that it was every bit as good as I remembered - if not more so. No two ways about it; this is one terrific movie.The action scenes and some of the special effects could be better, but the movie has utterly superb style, mood, plot and acting! The story itself is probably the best vampire-slash-werewolf story I've encountered (though admittedly I don't know many, as I'm not really a horror fan), and the ending is just fabulous.I also just love the thing about the chief vampires sleeping for predetermined periods of time, and are then revived - this is incredibly cool.And the whole thing is borne aloft by the great skill of the British lead actors - particularly hard-hitting cutie Kate Beckinsale, wild-eyed Michael Sheen and that late bloomer of a genuine acting icon, Bill Nighy, who gives an unflinching performance.It won't be long now till Underworld: Evolution comes out - and I'm just thrilled at the prospect of seeing more of this stylish world! If they can fulfill my expectations of the sequel, I will be making an upward correction of my rating of this movie from 8 to 9, because then we'll have a larger universe which makes sense in a larger context. That's how a good movie franchise should function.Crossing fingers!",8,66,101,31 October 2005
Shakespeare in Love," A pure delight
","Shakespeare In Love is, in my opinion, one of the best movies of the '90s, and entirely deserving of its awards. While less than serious and certainly less than faithful to history, it is conscious of being a comical take on the myth of Shakespeare's personal life, and scores points for sheer delight in the execution. All the cast is excellent, incl. Ben Affleck.Gwyneth Paltrow, who never struck me as a very interesting actress, rises with this excellent material and delivers the best performance of her career, quite on par with, say, Imogen Stubbs' portrayal of Viola in Trevor Nunn's near-perfect Twelfth Night (1996).Shakespeare In Love is a marvelously clever and literary feel-good movie that can be watched again many times. The only thing I'm not thrilled with is the simplistic, even annoying, soundtrack theme which is played over and over throughout the movie.10 out of 10.",10,1,2,13 January 2005
Iron Man 2," DAAYUM!!! Much better than the first!
","I liked the first Iron Man movie quite a bit, but there was a good deal of things in it that I was critical of. I felt that several bits didn't work very well, and the level of excitement just wasn't that great.They sure remedied that in the sequel!! Okay, so Scarlett Johansson didn't have much to do. Okay, so a couple of minor scenes were less than realistic (like, why do Happy and Pepper stay in the wrecked car during the fight when they could just run to safety - that sort of thing). And okay, so the drone army was not that threatening and didn't pack much of a punch. Aaand, Sam Rockwell's Justin Hammer was played a little bit too much for laughs. But these are very minor things. The overall mesh of plot lines, character interactions, comic book references, humor, action and sheer visual candy combined to produce the greatest entertainment value of any Marvel-based superhero movie yet. Hot damn!One of the things I liked best was the 'slow' part in the middle where Tony watched the old film from his father, and found the structure of the new element in the 'key to the future' model city (a city which had also actually been built, and in the center of which the climactic battle took place). Great effects, great plot element! :-) And the particle accelerator he threw together; that was massively great fun for me!There were a long list of comic book references in this movie that everyone who hasn't read the comics will naturally have missed. For instance, the reason they turned Justin Hammer into the Sam Rockwell type (Rockwell tends to play the same character, always sporting his trademark Nervous Chuckle) was to make him a comical element. In the comics that character is older and tough and very confident, but the movie version consciously parodied him in order to add more humor to the movie. Not that it needed it; it had plenty to go around!I just don't have any rally major gripe about this movie; I thought it was fabulous entertainment and much better than the first. Who SEZ this isn't the Mighty Marvel Age of Great Comic Book Movies?!9 out of 10.",10,9,19,30 April 2010
Shaun of the Dead," Pretty funny, but nothing special
","Considering that the British tend to have a pretty good sense of humor, I was a tiny bit disappointed with this movie. It was pretty funny, but most of it was in a drawn-out, understated way, which is not a bad thing, but here it wasn't really very clever, either. For me, there were only a few laugh-out-loud moments. The joke factor was no more than so-so.As usual with these movies, it's the characterization of the main characters that is the interesting part, and in this movie there were some nice elements of that, too, but it was a too obvious second-fiddle aspect, because ultimately everyone but the 'hero' and his girl died. I hoped that David would end up with Liz and Shaun with Dianne. Oh well.6 out of 10.",6,0,2,10 January 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," A worthy follow-up
","I went to the premiere Danish showing of this movie, and for a noon show it was remarkably well attended (Copenhagen's biggest theater, probably 75-80% full). I hoped the movie would be at least as good as the first one, and in fact it was. Not better, nor a terribly memorable movie; not much to think about after it ended, but while it lasted it was very funny and enjoyable - a worthy follow-up to the original.Well, one thing to think about might be the subplot about Elizabeth really being more interested in Jack than in Will... but we'll have to wait until the next movie to see if there's some real meat on that hook.I did think this movie was a bit too long. It had many great scenes and sequences, but at 150 minutes there were also some passages that were too long and boring. But it did have a lot of details, which was good.Johnny Depp was of course the spice of the movie, while Bloom and Knightley, as in the original, were adequate. Not great, not bad, but all right. Jonathan Pryce was good (as he always is), and I did wonder if Davy Jones was actually played by someone, or if he was fully CGI. Turns out he was being played by another brilliant Brit, Bill Nighy (hell, what would Hollywood do without all the British acting talent?!), which explains why he was so good.Next movie, I'm primarily looking forward to the return of Geoffrey Rush's character - and another generous helping of Johnny Depp's inimitable Jack Sparrow, of course!A pirate's life for me! Nah, not really! :-)My rating: 8 out of 10. Same as the first.",7,1,5,13 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Ages well
","I have just watched the original Pirates of the Caribbean for the third time. The first time was in the theater in '03, and the second time was when my brother bought the DVD in '04. While the first viewing was fun, I remember the second viewing as rather pedestrian. But I'm glad I watched it again now (after having seen and enjoyed the sequel), because I wasn't bored for a second of it. The dialog is sharp and funny (at times even intelligent), the story progresses very well, and the production values are top of the line (even if '03 CGI looks dated now - but by 'production values' I mostly mean the beautiful sets and environments).I was struck by how much of the action of the sequel is prefigured in the original movie, and how some puzzling details that are explained in the sequel were never revealed in the first movie (such as the 'compass that doesn't point north', which only in the sequel is revealed to be pointing at what the holder most desires).So while I originally rated the first (and the second) movie a 7 out of 10, I will now emend that to an 8, for both movies. They're a couple of great romps, packed with action, ideas, characterization and eye candy.The third movie, unfortunately, was a huge disappointment for me... :-(",8,2,5,23 July 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Over-hyped
","I'm fresh back from having seen Narnia on the biggest possible screen. I knew better than to have great expectations, so I was only slightly disappointed. The story is very straightforward - you know where it's going, and it just keeps on going there and going there. The book is too compressed here; events happen too fast and there's no real time for developing the characters.In the final analysis this Narnia movie is just a run-of-the-mill Hollywood production of a story that was and is a far better fit for the small screen as a TV series. Also, a big-budget production like this pretty much had carte blanche with the creation of the fantasy world of Narnia, and still they couldn't come up with anything particularly imaginative. This movie reads far too much like what it is, but shouldn't exclusively be: a kids' movie.4 out of 10.",4,1,3,30 December 2005
The Other Boleyn Girl," A besotted travesty of history
","I am all for trying to do something different, trying to make some new and intriguing point about this or that... no, wait, I guess I'm not. At any rate, whatever they tried to do with this freakosaurus of a 'historical' movie, they completely and unforgivably failed at. I know this bit of history well, and have seen most treatments of it in movies and TV shows; even the irreverent and sensationalist Tudors TV show is a masterstroke of brilliance compared to the pondscum that is The Other Boleyn Girl.This movie keeps developing into ever-greater extremes of absurdity, piling one thoroughly unbelievable scene upon the other. It takes rumors, it takes subsequent history, it takes impossible dialogue and it even takes *rape* and *incest*, and drops it all on the shoulders of Anne Boleyn. This is not only the worst and the least historical account of these events I have yet seen, but also the most offensive and malicious. It is complete, irredeemable nonsense.Why and how the classy actors could possibly stand for this, I will honestly never know. They must have cringed so loudly inside that the sound technicians must have deleted the creaking. There is only one word that accurately describes this movie: Ridiculous.Just one final complaint - an insult, really: How can this compost pile have garnered an IMDb rating of nearly 7? The people who have given this movie a good rating must be ignorant soap opera fans with barely a brain cell and a half to rub together.1 out of 10.",1,17,23,25 March 2010
Alexander," Too maligned
","I didn't think this was a bad movie. The problem that many people seem to have with it is, basically, that there was more history than entertainment in it. It was one director's honest, realistic and no-holds-barred interpretation of the life of a great figure from history, warts and all. Oliver Stone deserves kudos for this achievement, though I'll also say that the movie had a few problems.Most people - incl. myself, actually - had undoubtedly expected something more entertaining and action-filled. There certainly was action in it, but the action played second fiddle to the up-close-and-personal psycho-analysis of Alexander. We saw him as a very troubled figure. Not as much of a conquering hero, nor a character we could particularly care about. He had an interesting idealistic vision of the great cross-cultural civilization he would build, but we never really get into his mind about this. Instead, we see him worriedly trying to deal with a sea of troubles that beset him at every turn, mostly in the form of his Macedonian soldiers who don't agree with his conquering tendencies. This is all good and well, and a very valid and interesting take on what actually happened, but it fills too much in the movie, and takes away from the portrayal of Alexander the person; it undermines our chance to get a good understanding of the attractive sides of his ideas and visions. Possibly, Oliver Stone doesn't think Alexander's visions were that attractive, and possibly he's right. But Alexander is such an important, seminal and thoroughly adventurous historical figure that the viewer expects to see him as a confident, almost heroic, conquering pioneer. It's no fun to have him psychologically deconstructed. We have academic papers for that. The populace at large needs affirmation of Alexander the Great's actual greatness. This movie did not provide that. It was too serious; too ambitious. It kind of forgot that it was a big-budget Hollywood caper. But who knows, maybe sober posterity will look more favorably at what it was trying to do.The homosexual aspect didn't bother me that much, but then, I'm a tolerant person. The average movie goer, it seems, is not. Because clearly a lot of the bad rap this movie's gotten stems from people not being able to stomach the whole gay thing. Which really wasn't anything to make such a big fuss about. Before I saw the movie, I'd heard that there would be 'offensive' homo-erotic scenes in it. There wasn't. Sure there were a few scenes emphasizing the orientation and such (and one where Alexander kissed a male member of the Babylonian king's harem), but there wasn't any unsettling gay sex scenes, and what overtly sexualized 'gayness' there was, was quite tastefully done. (Of course, the boy who was raped at a party by some soldiers was an exception, but that was shown for the sake of realism.) One thing I thought was overdone, though, were the several shots of the male harem member (whom Alexander brought along on much of his journey of conquest) which had him looking down, bowing away, etc., emphasizing (particularly in the minds of the audience) that his presence was shameful. This shouldn't have been done, but it's a minor thing.Probably my biggest point of criticism is about the accents. I don't mind some of the actors using their own accents (like Farrell), but I mind some of the actors being given clearly artificial 'barbaric' accents. This was not very consistently done, and esp. in Rosario Dawson's case it was very grating. And that's really too bad, because it ruined the whole atmosphere of many scenes.Overall, however, I thought the movie was pretty good - certainly better than Troy -, and there were many spectacular scenes of Babylon and great battles, which I really enjoyed watching. I would have been happier, however, with a movie that had emphasized adventure and entertainment a little more. 7 out of 10.",7,0,2,6 December 2004
Constantine," Run-of-the-mill Hollywood horror
","Prior to seeing Constantine I had heard both good and bad things about it. I'd heard that those who've read the comic didn't like the movie, and those who hadn't, did. Now, despite being a comics collector, Hellblazer is one comic I've never read. However, I did know the premise, so I was kind of standing with one leg in each camp.I went to see it with eight other people. Half of them thought it was really cool, the other half thought it was pretty boring. The latter half, which included me, were the ones more thoroughly grounded in both comics and movies. Constantine offered nothing new or surprising for me, and I thought far more could have been done with the concept. The story was predictable; I knew where it was going and it just kept on going there. The effects did not impress me.Although, there was one thing (well, two) I did like. Tilda Swinton as the arch-angel Gabriel was absolute androgynous perfection, and worth watching the movie for. Just about the only part of the story I liked was Gabriel's reason for unleashing Mammon: To make people worthy of God's love. As if we have it far too easy, just being allowed to have our sins forgiven if we repent. I liked that. Secondly, Peter Stormare as Lucifer was also an excellent choice for the part. But other than these, I thought Constantine was a lack-luster, typical, pedestrian Hollywood project with no real bite whatsoever. A cleaned-up, watered-down version of the comic, entirely lacking that necessary bit of edge.I rate Constantine a 5 out of 10.",5,0,6,1 March 2005
Insomnia," Absorbing, off-beat thriller
","Insomnia was better than I'd expected. It kept my attention throughout, and all the main actors were very strong, esp. Hilary Swank (her best performance yet, I'd say). I liked the way Pacino's character was always far ahead of the rest of the police, trying to set things up behind the scenes. It was an unusual story, very well told and with a lot of effective characterization.I would like to rate it higher than a 7 out of 10 (I'd rate it 7.5 if I could), but I feel it also had some shortcomings. For instance, how did the murderer know all about Pacino's character's trouble with Internal Affairs when the local police didn't even have a clue? Also, since this is a remake of a no doubt superior original, I can't rate it as highly as its previous incarnation. So a 7 it is. But good movie.",7,0,0,27 December 2005
The Day After Tomorrow," As formulaic movies go, this is one of the best
","I'm distressed to see that there're a good deal of quite negative reviews of this movie. I think it's much, much more than 'mindless popcorn fun', or 'check your brain at the door'. It's true that it's a pretty formulaic disaster movie, and the characters aren't terribly deep, and the whole thing may not be great cinematographic art. But neither are there any really bad or annoying elements or performances (well, maybe the CGI wolves). There are a lot of really impressive effects, and concepts. The idea that a mega-hurricane can suck down super-cold air from the edge of space is mind-boggling, and I have no idea if it's at all possible. If it is, it's pretty damn scary.Dennis Quaid was solid and sympathetic in the lead, and Jake Gyllenhaal was definitely good (although 24-year-old Jake must be tired of playing teenagers so much lately). Emmy Rossum was a very attractive surprise (despite her looking enormously like James Franco's sister), and it was also cool to see Amy Sloan again.In my opinion, as a whole, the movie is exciting, relevant, current, has a good and important message and some good, charismatic actors. It is eminently watchable. What's more, though, this is a kind of movie that should make us think about the state of the world, and humanity's future. It brings up some important points, and if you disregard those, then you're doing the movie (and the world situation) a disservice. Hate to sound preachy, but if you care about the state of the world, this movie will touch you. The most emotional scene for me was when the tidal wave washed over New York. Powerful stuff, and damn real-looking.I'm not saying the movie couldn't have been better. It could have made its points in far more inspiring ways. And it had some sentimental scenes that I could have done without (such as the cancer kid).The only casting detail that I found a bit annoying was Sela Ward's stereotypical 'the wife', a generic part that the likes of her and Anne Archer've got down to a tee (though of course the fault is the scripter or the caster's). Other than that, I found only things to like about this movie. Judging from many reviews, its commitment to calling attention to the dangers of ignoring nature's warnings is deeper than most if the audience's. Hopefully it makes at least a few people more interested in the environment.",8,0,0,28 May 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Lightning doesn't strike thrice
","After enjoying the first Pirates moderately, and becoming a bigger fan of the series with number two movie, I am sad to report that the third installment completely lacks the action, humor and sheer fun of the first two movies. I'm amazed that the same people who put together the great romps of the two first movies could produce something as altogether lackluster as this one. Looong story with maaaany ho-hum relationships, and a lot of the story and the relationships are not followed up on in the end. And where's the humor? There were maybe two chuckle-out-louds in this movie. It was ridiculously boring to sit through.The most unforgivable aspect of the movie is the TOTAL LACK OF ACTION!! Every time something big is about to happen, something else happens which totally defuses the situation. Even in the climax, after setting up a huge naval battle, all we get is two or three ships clashing, and then the entire rest of the fleet just turns around and leaves. This is one of the most disappointing blockbusters I've ever had the misfortune to watch. Boy oh boy, what a misfire.3 out of 10.",3,22,46,23 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," The bad hype just isn't true
","Personally, I loved Spider-Man 3.I usually say that Americans tend to understand pop culture (esp. sci- fi and superheroes) much better than Europeans (who, for instance, loved the pretty awful British sci-fi movie Sunshine, which still hasn't opened in the States, and will get a heck of a beating when it does). But in the case of Spider-Man 3, it seems to be the other way around. Its plot-lines, themes and characterization were too complex and subtle and long-winded for a lot of Americans. Spidey 3 had an IMDb rating of 8.2 after being seen by a few thousand Europeans, which dropped to 7.9 on the U.S. opening day, and now, a couple of days later is down to an almost unbelievable 7.1! Now there we see a demonstration of what bad word of mouth will do. Once the rumor is out that the movie sucks, a lot of people will force themselves to go with the flow and unthinkingly agree with the popular position. Europeans will do this, too, but Americans do it with so much more gusto, and have more practice.I knew going in that Raimi & co. had wrestled with a difficult script, and worked very hard to make everything work. And I wasn't too hopeful, because although I kinda like the two first Spidey movies, I don't actually think their entertainment value is that great. I have seen them twice each (which includes once on DVD), and that's it. There is a strange stiffness to them, some kind of missing chemistry (made worse by the fact that I'm no fan of Kirsten Dunst), both among the cast and in the overall visual look. So truthfully I was actually a little bit disappointed by both of the first movies.Spider-Man 3 was quite different. The cast seemed to work very, very well together, the characters and their emotions came alive for me, and everything they did was part of clever plot-lines that were all interconnected. All the characters made mistakes, and all had a part of the blame for things not working out the way they felt they should. The characters now looked like genuinely flawed human beings. Every element of the movie contributed to this. Spidey became super-popular precisely so his self-centered elation would lead to his lack of empathy with MJ, who in turn neglects to tell Peter what's the matter, compounding their lack of connectedness. Perhaps, as many are fond of saying, this is chick-flick material, but superhero comics have always been soap operas. What matters is that it's told well; that motivations and actions make sense and feel real. And they do here. The relationship with Harry was also impressively well portrayed, even to the extent that I didn't even mind their using that most time- honored of soap opera plot elements: amnesia. And everything was tied in with the Venom symbiote boosting Peter's emotions, which produced a lot of great entertainment and ended up making Peter understand the value of forgiveness, both of himself and others. The movie did things that have never been done in the comics, and it did them very thoughtfully. It made the Spidey persona extra-popular, to compensate for the bouts of extra-bad luck the Peter Parker persona had to be dragged through, which was integral to the plot. It made Peter forgive his uncle's killer, understanding that there were (in the movie's universe) strongly mitigating circumstances - an event that could never happen in the comics because it's so fundamental a part of his whole being and motivation. But it worked beautifully in the movie. The story and the characters all ended up coming together beautifully. With the possible exception of the first X-Men movie (well, and perhaps Mystery Men), I think Spider-Man 3 is the best superhero movie ever made.It wasn't quite perfect, though. It's true that both Sandman and Venom didn't get enough background and development. What was the deal with Sandman's daughter? Was she just sickly, or was it something Sandy did that crippled her? Well, maybe they'll tell us in an extended edition DVD. I know I'd buy it.My rating: 9 out of 10.",8,0,4,6 May 2007
Resident Evil: Extinction," Resident Awful
","Sure, this movie could have been worse - if all the actors had had brown paper bags over their heads.I went into this movie thinking that it couldn't possibly be worse than the idiotically meaningless RE: Apocalypse, but lo and behold, Hollywood foiled me once again by producing something so craptacular that it exceeded even my saddest expectations.This movie is a failure on all levels. It is incoherent, nonsensical, boring, meaningless, unexciting, tedious, stupid, moronic, and just plain utterly deadbeat. There is no proper story of any kind, no characterization that makes the least bit of sense, and to top it off they go and retouch beautiful Milla's face, as if she didn't look good enough alfreakin'ready. The sheer dumbness of this production is just off the scale. Complete trash, waste of celluloid, time and people.And that's the best I can say.Spoilers? This entire movie is a spoiler. A spoiler of life and time. Avoid like the plague. 'Tis the reign of resplendent incompetence.I have given a name to my pain, and it is Resident Evil: Extinction.",2,2,4,29 November 2007
The Prestige," Good stuff!
","(DO NOT READ unless you have seen the movie or don't mind having it spoiled!)The Prestige seems to be one of those rare occasions when the movie is better than the book it's based on. The movie works well, and is very well produced. It's not without flaws, but the central stroke of brilliance is to bring in Nikola Tesla and using his outlandish theories to support the story of a couple of rivaling magicians in their attempt to out-do one another. This is a great idea, and the use of it in this movie is VERY cool. To those who don't know, Tesla both theorized about, and performed, several experiments that have never been reproduced, and so it is a great way to partially suspend disbelief to have some of his wild and mysterious ideas actually work.The movie falls short in several minor ways, though. For one thing, neither of the main characters are particularly likable. They come across as just that little bit too pathetic, even if they do sacrifice practically everything for their art (or was it for their rivalry?). I felt it would have been better to have one of them (the lower-class one, Bale's character) be more sympathetic than the other, and even end up duplicating himself to sort of recreate his lost twin. But we didn't see that, and instead Bale's character cowardly just shot Jackman's character out of pure spite. Doesn't exactly reflect well on him, does it.Also - the Tesla machine; in some scenes it teleported Jackman's character, and in others it made copies of him. So, which one was it? Could it be adjusted to do one or the other? Or did it do either at random? This was not explained. And the caged pigeon trick; this was always obscured. What was it supposed to do, exactly? Oh, I can guess (it slammed down flat, seeming to crush the pigeon, which however was speedily pulled out and hidden under the coat), but it couldn't be seen, and this annoyed me as I was watching it. But maybe it was because they couldn't actually do it, and hence not show it.Still, good and entertaining movie. I could definitely watch it again sometime. 8 out of 10.",9,2,3,11 January 2007
The Devil Wears Prada," Pointless
","Against my better judgment I watched The Devil Wears Prada. Hoping that it was a proper comedic satire on the fashion industry. But it was just another completely toothless Hollywood hot air balloon.What we have is an intelligent girl who should know better than to get involved in the industry of supreme shallowness, and she basically eats it up. Like just another bimbo she gets co-opted by the rat race and ends up defending, and relating to, the clearly evil dragon lady editor. That's the most pathetic excuse for a sob story I've ever seen.So are we supposed to cheer when our main girl finally, after her life has fallen to pieces, sees through the glamour facade and pulls out of it just in time to pursue the life she *really* wants? Puh-lease! Stupid plastered-on, half-hearted happy ending. She didn't *really* learn anything, and neither does the audience.Everything in this movie is totally cliché. Including that 'intellectual' circle of friends she meets regularly at the café. None of it rings true at any time.This movie works as only one thing: an analogy to Anne Hathaway's Hollywood career. A smart, funny, talented actress is chewed up by ridiculous, brainless Hollywood crap and spat out as just another run-of-the-mill pretty face. She should be better than that. I hope she's not totally ruined yet, but that's for the future to show.3 out of 10.",3,6,11,18 October 2006
The Bourne Ultimatum," Vastly overrated. Just a good actioner, nothing more
","An average user rating of way above 8, pushing The Bourne Ultimatum into the top-250? That is, of course, ludicrous. Just you wait until the guys at IMDb finds the time to give this movie a more weighted average. It's nowhere near good enough to be anywhere near the top-250.It's an exciting action-movie with a half-way coherent plot, which is rare enough in itself. But it's far from perfect. The assassins Bourne runs from are faceless and therefore not particularly scary or threatening.The basic plot about Blackbriar is not fleshed out enough; not explained well enough; we don't hear how it came about in the first place. Was it illegal or government-authorized? The plot reminded way too much of the second movie's plot; culminating in the exact same thing, with a confrontation with a bad guy played by an elderly British actor. Finney even looked almost exactly like Cox, sans the beard. Not what I would call originality, exactly.Also, we don't hear about what Nicky's past with Bourne consisted in, which is annoying seeing as this is probably the last instalment of a trilogy.Many shortcomings, but pretty exciting action.6 out of 10.",6,10,19,21 August 2007
The Aviator," Spectacular old-fashioned epic
","I really enjoyed The Aviator. Both in terms of story and acting, there was so much to look at and be entertained by. DiCaprio put in an excellent performance, the direction was generally very fine indeed, and the effects were almost perfect (I say 'almost' because, when the Hercules carrier took off in the end, it was very obviously computer generated). The aviation scenes were absolutely spectacular. All in all an engrossing and pleasant old-fashioned epic which, in my opinion, deserves an 8 out of 10 rating.Cate Blanchett's Katherine Hepburn was perhaps a little over-acted, but it doesn't matter, because the entertainment value of the role was so great. In the end, she did come across as convincing.Kate Beckinsale's Ava Gardner had a smaller role, which was a pity. She obviously became very intimate with Hughes, and in the movie we never really saw the two get to know each other. There was just a cut to a point when they were well into an established relationship. That was a little disappointing to me, because I really would have liked to see a larger role for Beckinsale. I think this role was one of her best yet. There was much more *character* in the Ava Gardner part than in any other role Beckinsale has had yet. Such fire in her eyes and expressions! (And, on a costuming note, what a stunning blue and red dress she wore in the scene where she helped Hughes recuperate from his solitary isolation!)Returning to the story, the last part of the movie seemed a little unfinished to me. The hearing scenes with Hughes being questioned by the senator and upstaging him were good, but we weren't really shown the full consequences of it. I wanted to see more of the aftermath. Also, the whole thing with Hughes' neurotic disorder was never really commented on; never explained or analyzed. Sure, we saw the childhood scenes that must have started it, but why was there no medical interlude of any kind?So, all things considered, not quite a perfect movie, but one I was fully engaged in and entertained by. That in itself is a rarity with new movies. I do hope The Aviator wins the Oscar for Best Movie. If you ask me, this is the kind of thing Scorsese should be doing, rather than all that boring and foul-mouthed mafia stuff.",7,0,0,5 February 2005
Watchmen," Not bad!
","Being a comics collector, I usually attend new superhero movies on the opening night, but I have a bit of a strained relationship with the Watchmen comic. And, having decided to reread it before seeing the movie, I had to delay seeing it for a week or two. The comic (not originally a graphic novel; that's the collected edition that people call a 'graphic novel' now, although it's more properly a trade paperback, only recently also given the hardcover treatment) has always been hard for me to read. Reading it is not much of a pleasure-giving experience for me - it's too dark, too misanthropic, too marred by a negative view of human nature. Which is kinda funny, because a lot of Alan Moore's other work is not like that at all. Watchmen is a singular work, probably intended as an experimental take on what a realistic world with superheroes, who were realistic characters, would be like. As a fan of classic superheroes and science fiction, I'm really not that interested in realism; I'm much more into idealized stuff where it's pretty clear who the good guys and the bad guys are. Watchmen only has relatively grey characters who're neither entirely good nor entirely bad, partly because they live in a complicated world where very few choices can be all-good. That's what this story is, mainly: an exercise in greyness. Even if the world is saved, it happens at the cost of millions of lives. There can be no good here, only a variety of evils, and the trick is how to choose the lesser evils over the greater ones. Of course, in such a world there can't be any proper superheroes, and that is one of the biggest reasons that Watchmen (the comic) doesn't really work for me.However, as a story containing an intentional message about moral greyness and the immense difficulty of making morally good choices, Watchmen is very successful indeed. It comprises an uproarious contrast to the usual superhero comics, which are morally black and white, never in doubt as to what's good and what's bad. I don't think Watchmen is intended as a scathing critique of the usual type of superhero stories; rather it is simply an exercise in reversal, in doing something different, and in so doing throwing the usual tropes of genre storytelling into sharp relief.The movie translates the comic into its own medium very successfully - if perhaps a bit *too* faithfully. Since I had just read the comic when I saw the movie, very little in the movie surprised me at all. It was really just going through the motions of the comic, using it as storyboards for the movie, and as such appearing as if any director could have produced an identical movie. The comic, and all its images, have become so iconic that nobody dares make any substantial changes, it seems. Well, all right. I suppose I would have complained about it if it hadn't been like the comic. Still, I do think it looked more like 'a comic book movie' than a proper movie in its own right. But I enjoyed the images, and found them quite a bit more palatable in this form than in the comic. So, high marks from me!The ending of the movie was the only thing that was changed from the comic. It was a fairly good change, using a quite convincing substitute idea. But the change also has bigger implications. In the movie, we end up with a world that believes itself to be watched by Dr. Manhattan, who then scares/forces people into submission much like the anti-war robot Gort did in the original The Day The Earth Stood Still. But, what's to keep people from reverting to warlike ways once they discover that Dr. Manhattan is gone? In this way, I think the movie transmits an even bleaker view of human nature than the comic.The genius of the ending in the comic is that you don't quite know whether Ozymandias' new world order will remain in place, or whether Rorshach's notes will blow the whole thing wide open and throw the world back into chaos and war. This is brilliant because the individual reader will interpret the ending according to his particular political view! If you are a cynical republican (or even just a conservative or libertarian), like Rorshach, you will believe that his notes will reveal the truth and throw off the yoke of Ozymandias' world order, replacing it with 'freedom', in whatever form. But if you are an idealistic liberal who thinks that Ozymandias actually and heroically chose the least of all possible evils, and in so doing best represented human nature, then you will be unlikely to believe that the publication of Rorshach's notes will make any difference at all. Nice one, Mr. Moore!By having an even bleaker view of human nature, the movie actually understands the point of the comic, and enhances it by disguising itself even more (also through the Comedian - a 'good guy' who keeps doing things that no remotely heroic character would do) as cynical and pro-Rorshach, when in fact its deeper attitude is the reverse: The world of this story really has a true hero, and his name is Ozymandias.Look upon Alan Moore's genius, ye mighty, and despair! :-)",10,3,7,6 April 2009
Justice League," Not bright enough, not big enough - better than feared, worse than hoped
","As a superhero fan since about 1984, and a big-time collector of superhero comics (although - full disclosure - admittedly a Marvel fan primarily), I consider myself to be in a position to judge just how successful this live action Justice League movie is. Had this come out some ten or fifteen years ago, it would have been a pretty awesome JL movie. It would have looked expensive and edgy, and most things about it would have felt fresh. Sadly, it has come out in 2017, as a too little, too late, too rushed and too cheap wanna-be movie, enormously ruined by its association with the absolutely horrible train-wreck that men call 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'. Horrified by the negative reactions to 'BvS', JL producers (or suits, more likely) scrambled to change the planned story of this movie, basically cutting it up and throwing away the dark second half (you can check out the leaked original plot in Youtube videos), to replace it with an ill-fitting brighter second half, in which we get a much brighter and 'gooder' Superman than we saw in 'BvS', courtesy of Joss Whedon's frantic but disappointing attempt to save the movie via damage control. And, while I think that all the changes have probably been for the better considering what we would have gotten from the original Snyder vision, that doesn't stop this movie from feeling choppy and terribly structured, with a plot (and villain) that isn't very interesting and just amounts to a lot of time-wasting. Lots of action and explosions, but very little story or character development.What chiefly dissatisfies me is that the movie just isn't cosmic enough. Why didn't they pour on the whole Darkseid thing? They should have pulled out all the stops! They are in competition with bloody Marvel Studios, which race onward with one amazing movie after the other while DC is standing still and scratching its behind. They should have gone for bigger and brighter, and poured more money into it, hiring more competent talent, especially regarding the writing. But it's DC. They do stupid things by force of habit (sorry, but they do. Many many people think so).Well, at least this movie isn't a total loss. I expected the worst, but there were quite a few things in the movie I liked (and, of course, more things I disliked. Why didn't we see more of Mera?). I particularly liked Cyborg, with his alien tech that kept evolving and producing new super-tech powers for him. That was cool, especially since I felt that he would be one of the toughest characters to make work. Besides the lack of arcs and development, I didn't have problems with the other characters, but I'll emphasize that I really loved Wonder Woman. She was a total inspiration. She succeeded in giving you the feeling that she would absolutely have your back, and truly care about you all the while, whether you were an innocent bystander or a comrade in arms. She embodies all the admirable and feminine qualities of mother, sister, lover and protector, and that is a heck of an achievement. The movie is worth watching for her alone.I hear that some people really like this movie, as in giving it 8 or 9 stars out of 10. Good for them. For me it was a bit of a hollow experience; something with the potential to be so much more. I rate it 6 stars out of 10, which means slightly above average, compared with other movies of its type. No classic, but conceivably something I'll want to watch again sometime. It's a shame Whedon couldn't do more to save it. Ultimately, I think they should have just redone the whole movie from scratch rather than changing it into a sort of happy zombie version of the original version. Who knows, maybe some form of the original cut will make it onto an eventual disc release. I doubt it will be better, but it will certainly be interesting.",5,12,24,17 November 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Overrated, to say the least!
","I have seen all the LotR movies several times now, and also the extended editions. And while the movies are fairly entertaining and have many beautiful scenes, I am generally not very impressed with them at all.They are generally filled with all the things *money can buy* - superb production values and master craftsmanship in many areas of technique and design -, but deplorably short on the things money *can't* buy, namely depth of characterization, good ideas and a well-balanced story structure. The characters are totally two-dimensional cardboards for whom it is incredibly difficult to feel anything at all, no matter how hard one tries. The translations of Tolkien's ideas are uninspired and predictably pedestrian. The storytelling frequently suffers from bad pacing. Building suspense is an art lost (or rather, never discovered) to Peter Jackson, so nothing becomes even remotely eerie or unsettling, though I'm sure today's young audiences think the tiresomely cheap shrieking effects of the Nazgul constitute proper creepiness.In short, the design efforts (all hail to Alan Lee) are gorgeous, but filmically speaking these movies are a study in cinematic blandness and sterility. Some of this may stem from Tolkien's original text, in which the characters are also almost total cardboards.But, I should also say some good things. Some of the actors are good, esp. Viggo and Orlando, and the guy who plays Faramir. And Ian McKellen, of course, and the splendid Andy Serkis. I also think Elijah Wood is right for the part of Frodo, but I have a problem with Frodo in these movies. He's always worried and tired and enooormously burdened. I can't enjoy watching him when he's constantly depressed like that! It's annoying and silly and ruins the character. I want at least a few scenes of him being happy! Being a proper Hobbit! Throughout these three movies he's just depressing to watch. Sigh.Sorry, on about the good things... The language. This is my single favorite part about these movies. Nary an American accent in sight! Superb phrasing, stunningly beautiful enunciation. Damn, Oliver Stone should have been paying attention to this when he did Alexander; with this quality of dialog and accents it would have been twice the movie it actually became. 'Whether by your will or not, there is no ship now that can bear me hence.' Whew, pure Shakespeare, mate! THAT'S impressive. And Théoden's last words: '[...] my ancestors, in whose mighty company I shall not now feel ashamed.' Magnificent!The trilogy does improve a bit as it moves on. This is mainly due to the fact that much more time is spent on the really interesting parts, namely the political developments, the wars, intrigues, etc. The human lands and characters - not to mention the far superior human dialog - are by far the most interesting to me; after having watched the movies several times, I now utterly loathe the entire Hobbit part of the storyline, which I find totally boring. I am consistently compelled to fast forward through those parts. My Ratings: The Fellowship of the Ring: 5 out of 10. The Two Towers: 6 out of 10. The Return of the King: 7 out of 10.",7,3,6,8 December 2004
Armageddon," Unspeakably awful
","Being an unrelenting non-stop over-the-top explosive melodrama, this movie is one of the worst action flicks ever produced, and utterly unbelievable in every way. The pace is constantly fever-pitched, and all the action and the actors are gripped by total hysteria. It is nigh unwatchable, and a stain - nay, a blotch - on the careers of everyone involved.The wildly exaggerated attempt at excitement undermines itself, resulting in a movie where you just go 'Come on!' all the time. The setting and the events are impossible to take even remotely seriously. I can only rate this abomination a 1 out of 10.If you want to see a good asteroid movie, see Deep Impact, which is intense, sensitive and thoroughly engrossing. Everything Armageddon is not.",2,12,26,24 November 2004
The Village," I know what I like, but I don't know if it's art...
","(Spoilers)The Village is one weird movie. It has loads and loads of subtext and symbolism. The 'dangerous' color, red, which has to be buried, signifies some form of passion. The 'safe', 'protective' color, yellow, signifies cowardice.While the movie's message isn't striking while you watch it, in retrospect it does seem to be about a society (the U.S.) of fear, conservatism and manipulation - but apparently that status quo is just maintained at the end.This is a movie that has 'art' written all over it, but it doesn't come through on it. It could have gone in lots and lots of brilliant directions, but it doesn't. On the face of it, it gives the impression of ending up vindicating Christian conservatism and nature romanticism; justifying cowardly people's flight from the real world. Very strange. That cannot be the final message, surely!Consequently one must conclude that Shyamalan has plenty of artistic intentions and ambitions, but he keeps so tight a lid on them that they end up having hardly any effect - it was really the same with Signs. In other words, he is too careful. He wants to say something progressive and radical, but can't solidify the message well enough to produce a well-rounded piece of meaningful movie-making. That's sad.Of course, I might be wrong. Maybe there'll be an extended version later which makes a lot more sense. This theatrical version I can only rate 6 out of 10, because despite other virtues it just does not make sense on a symbolical level (the level on which the movie is obviously meant to be primarily understood). But, maybe it's one of those movies that one has to think about for a long time and watch several times before one 'gets it'.I'd like to mention the acting as well. Much of the movie was delightful to watch because many performances are extremely good. It is natural to single out Bryce Dallas Howard, who shines through as an intelligent, mature and sensitive actress who will certainly be among tomorrow's greatest Hollywood talents.",6,0,0,29 September 2004
Pitch Black," A perfect sci-fi movie
","If you're a science fiction fan, and you've only seen this movie once, please, PLEASE go and treat yourself to a second viewing. I just did, and I was AMAZED about how good I thought the movie was, as opposed to when I first saw it three years ago. The first time around I was certainly impressed by the astronomical vistas we're treated to in this movie, but by and large I didn't think that much of the movie as a whole. It was an Alien rip-off, and I thought the description of the monsters was a case of really bad science. That they were allergic to light was something I found especially ridiculous. Based on my first viewing, I recently rated this movie a 5.However, now that the sequel, Chronicles of Riddick, is on the way, and the movie poster for that one looks amazing, I thought I'd better brush up on Pitch Black once more, so I borrowed the video from a friend. I am so glad I did. There's so much of what I thought I remembered from the first viewing that turned out to be wildly inaccurate. I thought most of the characters died very early in the movie. This was not so. I thought Claudia Black's character was the first to die. This was not so. I thought Riddick was the sole survivor. This was not so. I see now that the movie works *extremely* well. There isn't an excessive, tiresome focus on the monsters. It's much more of a human drama. The main characters are appealing and capable of some convincing acting. And there are so many little details that make the Pitch Black universe coherent and believable, such as the shortage of oxygen in the atmosphere of the planet they crash on, and the fact that the monsters have eaten everything on the planet, and so they turn on each other.And I have to mention the astronomical vistas again. I mean, we start out seeing the spaceship passing through a comet's tail, with bits of spacedust zapping through the hull. Then we come to a planet with three suns. Just as the shipwrecked people think it's about to get dark, a blue sun rises on the opposite horizon, and everything is engulfed in a blue glow. As the eclipse approaches, we see the huge, neighboring, ringed gas giant rise across the sky, and in the final scene of the movie we see the ship skid closely above one of these very rings. These scenes are created with a sense of beauty, wonder and detail, and I don't think I've seen any other SF movie that really made such a point out of including these things. I hope we see much more of it in the sequel.Pitch Black now gets from me a rating of 9 out of 10. A cult classic? You bet!!",9,0,0,26 May 2004
Cold Mountain," Good, but not an unmitigated success
","I never bothered to see Cold Mountain in the theater, because the style and subject matter didn't off-hand appeal to me. Still, I felt I had to see it eventually, so I thought I'd give it a try now.It's a good movie, but I also understand why it has many negative reviews. It surely isn't very engaging, especially not in the beginning. I do think it gets better and better as it goes along, with a notable improvement as soon as Renee Zellweger appears. Natalie Portman was great, also.But although I think Nicole Kidman is absolutely beautiful in this movie, it does start off being rather dull. As it proceeds, however, one starts being caught up in the terrors of the civil war and the way the land was left largely without men, because the few ones left - even the old ones - would be shot by the patrolling deserter hunters. It was a momentary total breakdown of civilization. I don't know exactly how realistically this movie portrays the situation, but I assume it's very realistic indeed.The ending of the movie was bittersweet. I was quite annoyed that Inman managed to return only to get shot dead by the last ranger - it seemed to invalidate all the hardships he'd gone through on his quest back to Ada. But the final scenes, with their daughter, Ruby's father and husband and their children, and the beautiful music they played, actually managed to restore my faith in the beauty and continuity of life (in the context of the movie's story). It shouldn't all ride on single individuals; what really matters is that life, in a broader general sense, goes on. It is life itself that matters, and we are all part of it. Every individual is somehow present in every other individual, in every blade of grass, in the land itself. This beauty; this appreciation for all life, is greater than the love for a single person, because it spurs those who survive to live on. And this movie's ending actually manages to convey that. So the ending was very fulfilling to me after all.Still, the entertainment value of the movie wasn't great, which is why I will not rate it higher than a 7 out of 10.",7,1,2,31 January 2005
Wanted," At least two serious flaws, without which it would have been a much better movie
","Wanted is partly based on a comic book, and let me tell you about the comic. It's a far out, foul language and generally butt-awful sci-fi/superhero thing with multiple dimensions and aliens in it. And costumed villains who have defeated all the heroes. The Fraternity are total bad guys, killers and rapists. Apathy prevails. And there ain't no loom.The movie, therefore, while not great, is a vast improvement over the misanthropic comic. They introduced the Loom of Fortune in order to turn the Fraternity into a sort of good guys, who only kill people who would go on to cause death and disaster if they were allowed to live. Coupled with a preternatural ability to curve bullets and maneuver cars and other equipment, this is actually a neat action concept. The Loom is supernatural and perhaps an act of God, but if you accept that it is, in some uncanny way, always right, then the basic premise is not bad. With well-directed action scenes, this could be turned into a really cool franchise.Or perhaps the correct wording is 'could have been', because they already messed it up in the first movie. Two basic plot elements served to ruin this movie, dragging it down from something quite cool to something totally mediocre:1. The beatings. As in the comics, our movie protagonist had to undergo severe beatings in order to become part of the Fraternity. Now, this may be believable (though still deeply repulsive) if the Fraternity are total bad guys, as in the comic, but it makes ZERO SENSE when the Fraternity, as in the movie, are GOOD guys! None whatsoever. And it's all the more disgusting for being so meaningless.2. The fact that Sloan turns out to be a bad guy. It's bad enough that it's awfully cliché to have the guy at the top be corrupt. But what's worse is it violates the whole principle of the Loom of Fortune. If Sloan were destined to go bad, then the loom should have ordered his assassination before he ever became leader of the Fraternity!! If the Loom is always right, then it can't make these kinds of mistakes. It doesn't make sense.A third and more minor complaint is that the trailer showed our protagonist and Angelina Jolie's character getting together, with a piece of dialog where Jolie's character says 'Do you want to?'. That part has however been completely excised from the movie. When is Hollywood getting its act together with trailers? What the hell is the sense of including bits that aren't in the final movie? Harumph!Still, it's a quite entertaining movie, the plot of which actually works most of the time.8 out of 10.",8,3,6,3 August 2008
Van Helsing," Yes, it's a mess, but...
","*Here there be spoilers!*Once again, a movie where viewer reactions run the full gamut from 'great!' to 'terrible!' - which must mean it's an interesting movie!And so it is. Despite what some people claim, it actually has an interesting and complex story: Dracula and his three brides are desperate for progeny, and have set huge plans in motion to that end; plans which comprise the culmination of the movie. And Gabriel Van Helsing himself... well, let's just say that his first name is no coincidence. Unfortunately, the story is told in fits and starts, parts of it even backwards. The narrative structure is a mess. Which is probably the reason that some of the audience fail to even notice the coherent story. Seriously.What I was feeling during most of this movie was: Rewrites galore. We have here a movie that starts out as comedy, and then gets more and more serious as it progresses, ending up as a tragedy! It seems to me that the script was originally serious and tragic, and then sometime in the production process some Hollywood executives decreed that no-one could take this seriously, so it had to be turned into a tongue-in-cheek comedy.This might have worked if they'd gone comical all the way. But they left in the tragic finale, with the death of the heroine! That was, excuse me for saying so, real stupid. (On the other hand, it occurs to me that the writers may have intended her death as a happy ending for *her*, since it meant she got to be with her dead family - but that's really too esoteric for most viewers, myself included.) Of course, I may be wrong about the rewrites, and this thing was a mess of bad writing from the beginning. Entirely possible. But I like the other theory better.This movie actually does have a lot of things going for it. For a movie buff, its myriad references to other movies, from Aliens to Sherlock Holmes, are very entertaining to spot. For this reason alone, I wouldn't put it past this movie to eventually develop a cult audience. There are also a couple of good lines ('Do unto others, before they do unto you!'), although only a few.The SFX were impressive. Some say they're cheesy, but that's just not true. The effects in *Underworld* were cheesy (and I still liked it!), but the ones in Van Helsing are MUCH better. There's so much good stuff here. Castles, cityscapes, rock bridges, animated paintings... Dracula's brides are very cleverly done, esp. when they change into their human forms. And the final transformation of Gabriel into the Wolf Man is great!
However - when all is said and done, the movie really is a mess. There are lots of situations with which a lot could have been done, but they merely serve as throwaways. There doesn't seem to be any deeper meaning to any of the action (except that it's all God's will or something similarly silly). And in the end the story doesn't satisfy. In the end, this is just another B-movie with only one real reason to watch it: the female lead.Kate Beckinsale is a vision of beauty and coolness. I never liked corsets until this movie. Her dark eyes and shock of dark-brown curls are absolutely delicious. Her character is stylish, spiritted and courageous, with just a hint of vulnerability. If you don't like Kate Beckinsale, you, sir, have no taste.6 out of 10.",6,0,0,6 May 2004
Being John Malkovich," Surreal, yet coherent
","That's what this movie is: a study in outrageous surrealism, yet managing to provide a coherent and relatively logical, understandable and engaging story. The ideas are completely zany and absolutely brilliant. The acting is fabulous, the dialogue is full of classic lines that you can laugh at again and again. Oh, and the heartfelt lesbian love-story doesn't make it worse! I once loved Cameron Diaz (esp. in The Mask), but some of her later work made me revise my opinion about her in a negative direction. I will say that here, though, she performs sensitively and admirably in every way. Catherine Keener, however, gets my vote for most attractive character in this entire beautiful mess of screwy order!This is a GREAT movie, right up there with the best of the best.10 out of 10.",10,1,2,24 January 2004
Collateral," Whaddaya know - a good Tom Cruise movie!
","As far as I am concerned, Tom Cruise's only good work thus far was Legend and Interview With the Vampire (and possibly Oliver Stone's Born on the Fourth of July, but I haven't seen that one).I wasn't in any hurry to see Collateral, but now I have, and I was quite surprised. It is enormously well-written; the story works on all levels, also as an action movie. Exciting, realistic, well-acted, well-directed - impressive in every way. Everybody involved did a stellar job, resulting in an action thriller of rare quality.I rate the movie a solid 8 out of 10. While it was a serious and thoroughly well-produced effort, it probably isn't going to achieve the status of a classic. But it'll certainly be worth watching again sometime.",8,0,2,26 April 2005
Aliens," Best action movie ever? Yes, it is.
","I know I'm not alone in believing Aliens to be probably the best (sci-fi/) action movie ever made. It may not be artistic per se, but the entertainment value is through the roof. Off the scale. The story is good, the execution is intelligent, the actors and characters are charismatic, and everything about the structure and pacing of the tale is just impeccable. The aliens are successfully and convincingly used as a kind of extra-terrestrial predator more vicious, threatening and deadly than any we know from the real world.As for the first Alien movie; while it is a supreme work of art and a great achievement, I think the sequel is better. But they're very different movies; one is sophisticated horror, the other is an unashamed sci-fi romp. Alien The 8th Passenger is realistic to an extent perhaps unequaled in any other SF movies, and its spaceship setting is sublimely perfect. Aliens, however, is heroic and hardboiled yet sensitive space action in the manner that other sci-fi/action movies only dream of. All elements are balanced perfectly, and the viewer can engage their emotions in the action over and over. Aliens is the definitive action movie yet produced.10 out of 10, easily.",10,1,2,2 January 2005
Resident Evil," A Must-See For Milla Fans!
","I can't believe that an actress who's been working for so long is still only 29 years old! She ages with supreme grace, and has *never* looked better than she does in Resident Evil. Wow!The movie itself is fair. Not great, not terrible. Pretty good SFX. It's a techno zombie thriller, and for what it is, it's effective enough. Considering how bad movies based on computer games usually are, this one is pretty good, although it has problems getting started. There are a few scenes that don't make sense (and that cop - Matthew? - where does he really come from?), and it's never really clear that there's only one of the CGI mutating zombie animals loose. The technobabble explanation we get for the zombies is a worthy attempt to 'technofy' the zombie genre, but it doesn't quite work, esp. not the part about the 'need to feed'. All in all the movie brings back memories of Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, and I'm sure the sequel will, too.Milla Jovovich gives good face. She doesn't really have anything to do for the first 45 minutes (other than look beautiful, of course), but she's very cool when she starts pouring on the kicks and punches, and her character is likable and heroic (and did I mention good-looking? And that outfit she's wearing...!). One wants to see more of her. With some better writing, this sort of role would be perfect for her. Accessible, kick-ass adventure with an appealing female lead (or several). If movie-makers know what's good for them, this is the kind of thing they should do more of. Much more.",6,1,2,12 January 2004
District 9," District 9 is more subtle than you might think
","District 9 is a movie to think about. The first (and second) time I watched District 9, I wasn't quite sure what to think. I came at it from the p.o.v. of a science fiction fan, and I thought some of the SF elements were not entirely thought through. But I thought some more about it, and things started to gel.Movies have been made before that people thought were about racism. I'm thinking of a brilliant film like Pleasantville, which on the face of it seems to be about race, but was much more complex underneath that surface. And I'm thinking of another brilliant 1998 film like Bulworth, where race was used to symbolize rich and poor. District 9, at first, seems not simply to be about race, but about xenophobia generally, and the plight of refugees especially. Penetrating deeper, this appearance however, while effective and admirable, is also deceptive. District 9 is one film that actually IS about racism. This is a South African film. The aliens in it arrived 28 years ago, when the inhuman Apartheid system was still in effect.So what is this film saying? Get this: It is using aliens to explain to us that there is still effective Apartheid in South Africa today. The aliens symbolize the black South Africans, and how they are still ostracized from much of common/white society and kept in crime-infested and corruption-ridden areas. Having no future and no hope and no voice. That's also why, in the film, the Nigerians are Nigerians - they couldn't be South Africans, because the *aliens* are the South Africans.The bio-fluid used to power the space-ship represents the life-force and will to live that the black South Africans have lost. In the film, it must be the catastrophic loss of almost all their bio-fluid that led to the big ship's crash in the first place, and to the poor condition of the aliens inside it. The alien technology represents cultural substance; it is a beautiful symbol of all that we have to learn from so-called primitive cultures. If we'll open up to their problems and cultural content, we will all be the richer for it.Even the documentary form of the first part of the film also makes proper sense in light of this interpretation. The documentary part is supposed to make the audience identify with the whites, whereas when the documentary style of storytelling disappears, the audience is left free to choose a different allegiance. In other words, we start by being shown that *we* are the ones at fault, and then we are given the opportunity to change.This is a brilliant film. I rate it 10 stars out of 10.",10,48,77,13 September 2009
Batman Begins," The dark & gritty Batman comes to the big screen
","What we see in this movie is the 'dark & gritty' (TM) Batman, which was introduced by Frank Miller in 1986 in the comics mini-series Dark Knight Returns, which was an alternate future version of Batman. But Miller also gave the 'real' comics Batman the dark & gritty treatment in the seminal Batman: Year One story, which is perhaps the greatest Batman story ever created (also because of the effective artwork of the excellent David Mazzuchelli), and which chronicles, among other things, Bruce Wayne's initial (pre-Batman) martial arts training in a remote mountain region. In the comics, a creative force as strong as Frank Miller was bound to yield massive imitation by less original comics creators - and so the early 1990s saw the Batman character getting consistently and increasingly dark & gritty, to the extent that the entire Batman universe was based on that darkness and grit.So the question is, does this work in a movie? Well, in my opinion it didn't even work in the comics, so, no, for this and other reasons I don't think it works in the movie, either. I always preferred the pre-Miller Batman, whose comics were driven by the stories and not simply by mood and style.Batman Begins is not a bad movie. It has many good things. The story has lots of great ideas. Most of the changes to the Bat-mythos were thoughtful and effective. I even loved how the Batmobile had to jump over a moat every time it left and entered the Bat-Cave.Unfortunately, the movie is atrociously directed. Everything is much, MUCH too dark, and considering how bad-looking the terribly cut fight scenes are, the fast-moving action and scatter-shot dialog are particularly grating. Most characters beside Bale's and Neeson's don't have enough to do, or get no significant characterization. Oldman's Gordon is wildly underplayed, and I could never separate Michael Caine from Michael Caine, which I needed to do if I were to find him convincing as Alfred. I think the structure and editing of the movie was terrible, and the decision to make a comic-book movie so dark that you could hardly see what was going on, was a monumentally bad one. It was a decision made, no doubt, to emphasize the medium of the movie over that of the comic, and it made the director attempt to create some kind of art movie - and apparently many people feel he succeeded. I didn't.And I thought the special effects were another big problem. There were too many of them. Why did the plot need a hallucinogenic drug, so faces could twist and horses could breathe fire? Because, I'm certain, the movie-makers felt they had to deliver the special effects spectacular that they thought superhero movie audiences have come to expect. A commercial decision, thus, to blow some dough on unnecessary SPX, just because the audience probably would think it was a cheap and unimportant movie if it didn't have any. So, no, I was not impressed at all; rather the opposite.And unfortunately I have to make one more serious complaint. Ra's Al Ghul was very cool and very well played and everything, but his scheme was ridiculous in the extreme. Through centuries and even millennia his 'league of shadows' (the actual size of which is never shown) would destroy civilizations (oh, or just cities) at the height of their decadence, like God striking down Sodom and Gomorrah. And now they'd decided that Gotham City should be destroyed? I'm sorry, but I find it ridiculous on at least three levels. First, wouldn't they target more than a single city? What use will it be to destroy one city? But, of course, this would depend on their man-power, which we are never made privy to. Maybe they're just, like, twelve guys. It certainly looks that way. Second, Ra's had been planning to destroy Gotham for, like, twenty years or more?! So, basically, he's been focusing all his resources on just Gotham for at least two or three decades, while events in the rest of the world has had no bearing on the situation? That's preposterous. And third, where's the sense in going in to help exacerbate the decadence and crime and corruption before delivering the death-stroke? They are totally becoming the very thing they would destroy. And sure, they're the bad guys and all, but shouldn't their scheme have SOME modicum of logical coherence? Apparently not. So anyway, not a great, successful movie as far as I'm concerned, but the typical commercial fluff with a hurried narrative and a holey rusted plot, Batman.6 out of 10.",8,24,43,13 July 2005
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," One of the greatest kung fu classics of all time
","Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a bona fide masterwork.It's an off-beat kung fu movie with an epic love story, and every single part of it works stunningly well. I can watch it again and again, and keep being totally enthralled by the action, the acting and the beautiful cinematography. It is clearly Ang Lee's finest two hours.This is a true classic, which sets a new and far higher standard for subsequent kung fu movies to live up to. And while some movies have matched and even exceeded this standard in terms of visually stunning martial arts spectacles (see Legend of Zu and House of Flying Daggers), the thing that no later movie has yet matched is the quality of the story and characterization. In fact, I doubt *any* martial arts movie ever made has the satisfying level of emotion and character that this movie has.Crouching Tiger generally avoids clichés of any kind, and doesn't conform to traditional storytelling structures, either; most notably in that it lacks a great climactic fight at the end. To the movie's great credit, the viewer never feels that such a violent climax is necessary.It also lacks a happy ending, which is the only thing about the movie that I think borders on the problematic. I would really have liked to see Shu Lien and Li Mu Bai end up together, now that they have suppressed their love for so long.The strange end, with Jen throwing herself off the mountain, is indeed bordering on the nonsensical, but somehow it works. It brings a kind of serene closure to the experience, and one leaves the movie feeling nothing but elation.The only modern kung fu movie that is on par with Crouching Tiger is Hero, which has an even better story (in my opinion), and even better cinematography, but not quite as much sheer entertainment value and excitement. The two movies are too dissimilar to be compared by the same criteria; Hero is much more of an art movie and has a totally different tone and message. Rate-wise, both movies are perfect 10's, though.",10,3,5,8 December 2004
X-Men: The Last Stand," Moronic movie-making
","This movie had one good thing going for it: The first half hour. For the first 30 min. or so, up until the first funeral, I loved it. Perfectly produced superhero movie. Story, action, comic-book references (the Danger Room!!), lots of cool stuff. Establishing a great threat as Phoenix kills the proff.And then it all just goes poof! All gone. No characterization, nothing even remotely exciting or meaningful happens thereafter. It's just an extended version of the trailer. Nothing has an emotional impact, and the storytelling doesn't even begin to live up to the most basic of narrative requirements. How the bloody hell can the producers think that this is even remotely acceptable?Yeah, the Golden Gate thing was cool. And all the characters, and the way they used their powers. That worked. I didn't even mind that there were so many characters who didn't have much to do. What I minded was the ridiculously poor storytelling ability and the complete lack of any emotional matter or motivation on the part of the major characters. Jean Grey/Phoenix, for most of the time, was just standing around like a zombie doing *nada*! The climactic scene with her and Wolvie contained no feeling whatsoever - none! That is the worst possible betrayal of the original story.This is clearly the worst of the X-Men movies, and a tragic squandering of a great, great opportunity. I hated Hollywood yesterday and I'll hate them again tomorrow, but this movie made sure I hated Hollywood TODAY! Only the first half hour of this movie keeps it from being complete excrement, and all the four stars are for that opening third of the movie. As a whole, the movie deserves much less.4 out of 10.",6,4,6,27 May 2006
X-Men: Apocalypse," Could have been great, but ruined by botched ending
","Huge fan of the comics here. As X-Men: Apocalypse began, the opening scenes instantly took my breath away. DAMN good!! Apocalypse's subsequent awakening (due to the meddling of Moira MacTaggart!) and search for his four horsemen were also pretty great. I loved seeing Scott Summers and Jean Grey. All the great stuff with Magneto was also nearly perfect. The movie builds up to its climax for a long time, and it's all good (though not quite perfect) - but once the climactic events begin in the second half of the movie, it all goes off track. First Apocalypse sends all the world's nuclear weapons into space - a cool sequence... but, we think he is going to use them; use the raw power they comprise. Instead he just throws them into space, so humanity can't use them. Even though he clearly wants to destroy most of the world. Doesn't make sense; it deflates the inflated audience expectations. Next, in the true climactic fight, nobody's motivations are addressed in the least. Magneto changes his mind, and soon after some of the horsemen do, too, but we don't hear why! We hear no reasoning of any kind! It's a fight in which the good guys practically only win the day because most of the bad guys decide to switch sides for no adequately explained reason! It's as if the movie just suspended its storytelling, gave up on all characterization and just relied on nothing but visual spectacle to wow the audience and carry the climax.Sadly, it doesn't work. Another of the main things that doesn't work is when Jean Grey 'phoenixes out'. The flame bird looks great and all, but the whole point of that character is that she is transformed by the change - and she wasn't! Not in any way at all! This was really annoying! I was so excited about what she would become now; whether she would break out as Dark Phoenix or at least just Phoenix, but nothing at all happened except amping up her power level. There was no effect on her character. That is almost as disappointing to me as the last time they botched the Phoenix story, namely in X-Men: The Last Stand, where they just had her standing around and doing nothing. WTF?!X-Men: Apocalypse had too many characters. Storm and Psylocke in particular got hardly any real development; we didn't hear their motivations and except for Storm at the very end, they didn't get a chance to be heroes. Mystique also had very little to do in this movie. She brought news of Magneto's change, and she brought Nightcrawler with her, but she didn't have much else of consequence to do. Her power level was too low to influence the final battle. They should have done more with her, and shown us what connection she had with Stryker, as per the end scene of the previous movie. A lot of the problems with this movie seem to be caused by having had to make it in a damn hurry. They should have waited a year and spent the time working out a better story.Still and all, with all the action and cool characters, this is still a damn good-looking and entertaining superhero movie. I still rate it an 8 out of 10, even though it's best in the beginning and just gets weaker from then on. A good thing I haven't mentioned yet is the music. I really thought the music worked very, very well in this movie.X-Men: First Class (2011) was an astonishingly great movie; 10 out of 10. Days of Future Past (2014) was also fantastic; so many great details and a very cool and complex story: 9 out of 10 stars! Sadly, X-Men: Apocalypse is yet another step down from that level; it's a furious chase movie with a weak plot and villains whose motivations aren't explored in any detail, and some of whom (Magneto!) changes allegiance for no apparent reason. Such a shame! I really expected better from Simon Kinberg after the extraordinarily well-made two previous X-Men movies.",8,6,13,19 May 2016
The Illusionist," Not much more than mediocre
","I have to say I was a little bit disappointed with The Illusionist. It had top-notch production values and a classy cast, but it was not quite enough. It was more of a crime/love drama than a magician story. I'm sitting there waiting for more magic tricks, and explanations for the ridiculously great acts he performs, but the story won't go there. It just focuses on the love story, like a hundred thousand other movies. To me, it was boring. It didn't deliver. Sure, I didn't see the end coming, and it was logical enough, but not that impressive. How did he create those intangible holograms? No explanation. That's just silly.I went to see 'Perfume - The Story of a Murderer' on the same day as I saw The Illusionist, and the former movie was much superior. An art movie. Whereas The Illusionist is just well-produced fluff.6 out of 10.",6,35,54,3 January 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," A cosmic letdown
","As a comics reader who knows the source material, FF2 left me with a great deal of reservations. The ending in particular disappointed me. The new superhero movies always let us down when it comes to the cosmic part of the original stories.Let me be clear: I am not a purist. I don't demand that the movies should be slavishly faithful to the comics. It's fine by me that they change the story, as long as what they put in there instead is just as good. And this, of course, is the problem. In the X-Men movies, we never see the alien Shi'ar, even though that's where the X-Men got their super-science. In Spider-Man 3, we never saw the planet from the Secret Wars storyline, where the alien symbiont, Venom, came from. And now, in FF2, we don't get the huge back-story of Galactus. We don't even get Galactus as a defined character. In the movie he's just some sissy-ass cloud monster who, ridiculously, can be destroyed by his own servant, the infinitely less powerful Silver Surfer. No way. Does not compute.Galactus, in the comics, is a force of nature. He can be stopped, and sometimes even reasoned with, but he can't be destroyed. His fate is tied in with the fate of the universe. If you like the science fiction part of superhero comics, the ridiculously diluted 'Galactus' of this movie is a massive, massive letdown.And unfortunately, there were a great deal of other problems with the climax of FF2, especially this:<ul><li>The power swapping. That kind of thing does not happen in the comics without a whole lot of proper explanation. Here: none. AND, after seeing that whoever the Torch touches will swap powers with him, how does it follow that he can just absorb all the powers of the other three, who are then powerless? It doesn't. But they just casually know that that's what will happen, and casually go ahead with it, making the fight and climax equally casual.</li></ul><ul><li>The Surfer's allegiance. When exactly does he switch? Surely not before he sees Susan die (another stupid element - the comics Surfer does not go around resurrecting the dead). And yet, Reed and the others plan for him to stop Galactus even before Susan dies. Doesn't make sense.</li></ul>And that was just the climax. We also have other problems: Why is Doom even in the movie? They tried to conflate several of the greatest FF stories of all time, but stuffing these plots into this storyline just makes it half-assed. There's none of the original impact here.Another thing I wasn't too fond of was the comedy. It's okay to have a few funny scenes, but in this movie they just went on and on playing the powers for laughs. It detracts from the seriousness of the story; ESPECIALLY a Galactus story, for cripes' sakes! So, I have to say this movie was a big disappointment to me. I really liked the first one. I rated it an 8. This one only rates a 3. Considering my great expectations, this comes as nothing less than a cosmic letdown.And to all those who claim that this sequel is better than the first one: Shyeah. What do you know.",3,90,138,15 June 2007
Children of Men," Another art movie
","If you try to watch Children of Men as a straight story, it has many shortcomings, against which many criticisms can be leveled. Too many questions, too few answers. But it was an art movie, making a statement about the apathy infesting our own current world. People have lost the ability to love. Children, of course, represent love. But people are crashing emotionally, becoming increasingly isolated as the old networks of mutual support are collapsing due to the heartlessness of the modern, money-grubbing lifestyle. So things are looking pretty grim.Fortunately, somewhere, there are still a few people left who can sustain the high spirits that have died in most people. This movie is about their against-the-odds struggle to keep that fire burning, and hopefully one day transfer it to the rest of humanity. This is all the movie is about, and it is minimalistically structured accordingly. Nothing extraneous is included; not even the kind of details that would have made this a wholesome story with a clear internal point. Such things would have detracted from the real message, which is that we are becoming too cold, and we better start rekindling some passion, or we'll eventually destroy ourselves.8 out of 10.",9,1,4,14 January 2007
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," It was SO not better than the first!
","Just saw RE: Apocalypse today. I don't play the game and I'm not a particular fan of zombie flicks - I watched it to see Milla Jovovich. She looked incredible in the first RE film. This sequel was, in most cases, a big disappointment. Yes, the story structure was better than in the first movie, but essentially just as insubstantial, if not more so. This is mindless action, with scenes incredibly quickly cut in order to disguise the lack of both real choreographic ability and good-looking martial arts moves. Jill Valentine was a bad Lara Croft imitation (complete with the blue-green top piece), whose only function was to be upstaged by Alice. This is a really bad movie, a major reason for which being that it was wildly underlit, so we couldn't really see what was going on - a flaw that many bad low-budget and over-commercial movies have. More seriously, we couldn't see Milla's face very well. *Sigh!* Now THAT's a crime!There were one or two cool scenes in the movie, but that doesn't do much to redeem it. This movie gets from me a rating of 4 out of 10.Incidentally, one of the cool scenes is at the end, when Milla looks into the surveillance camera wearing that crimson lipstick... Whoa! In fact, what this movie mainly failed to do, IMO, was to feature Milla's face more prominently. It should have built its entire shooting style around that great face, as, to an extent, the first movie actually did.",4,1,3,11 September 2004
Big Fish," Brilliant
","Big Fish is a tragedy. It's about how Edward Bloom is stupid enough to marry the nice, respectable bourgeois girl (Alison Lohmann) instead of the smart, zesty and wild witch-girl (Helena Bonham-Carter) that he was really destined to be with. Bloom's life then becomes a search of what might have been, and a self-search about where he went wrong. Where we might go wrong. As with all tragedies, it is a warning to us, about choosing correctly. Choosing life and vitality and genuineness and CHANGE, over the old-fashioned, respectable image of static, conservative, unchanging 'perfection', as the boring, nauseatingly normal surrounding society sees it.What is art? Art is something that overwhelms you, catches you off-balance, or, indeed, throws you off-balance. Tells you things you didn't know and are surprised to discover. Big Fish does that. The point is to demonstrate that all those wild and outrageous stories were not just fiction. On a symbol level, they were all true, but it's a truth we are not prepared for, or capable of accepting. Hence the need to present them as symbolical.Remember, it's all true.",10,2,4,19 September 2006
Pride & Prejudice," Not for Austen purists - the rest of us love it!
","When I studied English lit in college we were supposed to read Pride And Prejudice. I only got through a third of it. Jane Austen is a writer you either love or hate, and I belong in the latter category. This bourgeois ad nauseam obsession with manners and marriage is extremely far removed from my own experience and my preferred way of life. I like classic literature, but in my opinion Jane Austen's work usually doesn't qualify.This movie, however, creates a proper, worthwhile narrative, loaded with classic symbolism, taking the basic plot from the novel, and doing something quite different with it. In this movie Elizabeth and Darcy are forces of nature, undergoing an evolution towards a union based in poetic beauty, as is conveyed by the long scene at Darcy's estate towards the end, admiring the sculptures, etc. (a scene not in the book).I have seen most of the other Jane Austen movies and TV series (it saved me reading the books), and this one is the first that properly translates the substance of a novel from the literary medium to the movie medium. It uses imagery. It establishes a highly visual and visceral setting. The cinematography here is capable of making a dung-heap look good! The panoramic beauty of the camera's movement across a breathtakingly authentic late 18th century semi-dilapidated farm and grounds is a bloody cinematic triumph. This era and the financial situation of the Bennets is presented infinitely more believably and interestingly than in past adaptations, and together with the scarce use of the original dialog and the fairly sketchy representation of the original plot, the end result is a lingering visual feast that gains far more than it loses. If you think, like me, that Austen is wildly overrated, then this movie actually succeeds in making her story palatable. My hat is off to the incredible rapport that must have emerged between the screenwriter and the director in the production of this movie. It is a thing of cinematic beauty.I feel I should add, though, that I was not at all as taken with Knightley's performance as everyone else seems to be. She was adequate, nothing more. The meat of this movie lay in the cinematography.9 out of 10.",9,0,1,14 January 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Good, but there's something missing...
","Just saw this movie today. I rate it an 8 out of 10, which is lower than many others do. I like the movie, and I think the story is absolutely great, and really, really works. But for reasons that I find difficult to define, the movie just didn't *really* grab me. There's something too polished about it. Some kind of charisma missing. For one thing, Jim Carrey's character is incredibly boring (and it's not because I expect him to be a joker like in his other movies; I acknowledge his ability to do serious roles), and one doesn't understand what Kate Winslet's vivacious character sees in him. As delightful as Winslet is in this movie - clearly the best thing in it -, the central insecurity of her character is never thoroughly explored (but then, maybe that was never the point). Still, the story is of a rare multi-layered complexity, and the fact that, at its core, it's a heart-felt love story, makes it all the better.Kirsten Dunst is also great; this may be her greatest performance yet (and that's coming from someone who's not generally a Dunst fan). In fact, the entire supporting cast is very good, even Elijah Wood's shallow/pathetic trickster character. In terms of the story itself, this package is incredibly well-rounded and with artistic integrity to spare. It's hard to find any flaws about it, other than that rather indefinable lack of charisma in the execution. I expect it'll seem better to me in time; already I'm finding myself describing it in my mind as engrossing, although I didn't feel all that engrossed just as I sat in the theater. But I guess I have to relent: Yes, this is a classic movie, and a rare cinematic achievement.8 out of 10 is still as high as I can go, though.",7,0,1,11 September 2004
Avatar," :-(
","Sigh. Where to begin. This movie - the story I mean - had enormous problems right from the start. Jake's brother gets killed for 'the paper in his wallet'? What, paper money in 2154?? And where exactly did he get killed? On Pandora? A small corporate-military-scientific installation? Crawling with common thieves/murderers? Come on!And it goes on from there. All sorts of questions relating to the events and characters are never explained. What on Earth is unobtainium (an unoriginal term) used for, since it's so expensive? No explanation. The characters are total cardboards, incapable of mustering any audience identification or sympathy, with no cool lines, no good acting performances (except Zöe Saldana's), no nothing. The story is predictable and made up of clichés. I liked the 'Gaia plug-in' thing they had, but having all the animals rise to the occasion at the end was just too Disney. The greatest plot hole was that the military could just have nuked the site instead of using a conventional assault. When they get back there next time, they'll probably do exactly that. So no proper closure, nor believable behavior, given the available technology.There were some cool scenes, sure. But without a good story and good characters and capable actors, cool action is utterly meaningless. This was a pretty package with no substance, just what you expect from average, mainstream Hollywood fare, made by a director who's compromised his integrity for money. The script sounded like Cameron wrote it when he was twelve, way waaay before getting around to mature and masterful work like Aliens and Abyss.This is the kind of movie that, because it contains something new (the CGI), will be a big hit now, but in just a few years it will be outdone by other movies and quickly look dated, and the cheesy story will relegate it to history's dung heap, deservedly forgotten.I had hoped this would be the SF movie of the decade. As it is, it's unintelligent schlock which will probably be toe-cringing to sit through a second time. What a freaking shame. 2009 only had four really good SF movies: District 9, Star Trek, Surrogates and Battle for Terra (which may have been made in 2007, but was released in 2009 - it is a much better version of Avatar than Avatar). Avatar certainly doesn't make my top-250 - nowhere near.6 out of 10.",8,6,12,20 December 2009
The Last Samurai," Phantastic!
","Not being a big fan of Tom Cruise, I put off watching this movie for a couple of years. Now I had the chance to borrow the DVD from a friend, and I just watched it, amazed all the way through. Dammit, this is a movie that delivers! It is the most emotionally moving film I have seen for ages (well, since Monday, anyway... but that was a special case) - I lost count of the many, many scenes that made me misty-eyed -, and at the same time it was a great action movie, containing plenty of both swordplay and gun-play. Not to mention history. It focused on a crucial historical moment, where the old Samurai ways of feudal Japan had to give way to the vagaries of the modern world and its modern weapons and dirty politics.The acting was all-round great, and the production values were simply astounding. A movie of incredible beauty and power.As far as the debate on whether it's an art movie as such; no, I don't feel there is a 'high art' aspect to this movie. I think of it as a serious - and seriously good - movie, produced by people who understood how to make drama convincing, and who were experts on cinematography. But I will say that it comes CLOSE to being an art movie; it certainly has enough poetic moments, both visually and emotionally, to make such a claim stick. But a movie doesn't have to be an art movie in order to be good. The Last Samurai doesn't suffer from not being an art movie. It is the movie it is supposed to be; a highly competent and evocative one.The only reason I don't give this movie a 10 out of 10 is that it romanticized the Samurai too much. In reality, they too were embroiled in dirty politics, and most often never questioned authority (and if they thought that their authority figures were all honorable, they were fooling themselves). But it is true there is a certain purity in their concept of honor, and in many ways that honor was the basis and the substance of their civilization. The movie does a good job presenting this honor from its best angle, and as a work of art it is most certainly entitled to do so.A triumphant and beautiful achievement. I will buy the DVD tomorrow.9 out of 10.",9,1,3,29 March 2006
Total Recall," One of the best sci-fi romps ever
","Paul Verhoeven perfected in Total Recall and Starship Troopers the super-satirical, anti-establishment outlook that he tried with very limited success to capture in RoboCop. Total Recall and Starship Troopers are perhaps the two smartest SF movies ever made. Both have deep themes, and both are supremely entertaining and can be watched over and over again. When I think of all the horrible movies that are being made every year, one of my few consolations is to remember that perfect, visionary action feasts like Total Recall and Starship Troopers also exist.Total Recall was a hit with me since the first time I saw it in 1990. It posed a number of questions about its own structure that I struggled with for years, before finally understanding: The *entire movie* is the Rekall implant. From the first frame to the last. Both Quaid's comfortable life/wife, his job at the construction site, his visit to Rekall - it's ALL part of the implanted experience. That way everything makes sense, and it's just beautifully made.Also in terms of the overall production values, the movie is immensely well-made by 1990 standards. Great actors, great story, some funny dialog and lots of splendid action and excitement.10 out of 10, definitely.",10,2,7,22 September 2006
The Descent," Sigh!
","I am genuinely mystified as to why this movie draws such high ratings. I'm also really annoyed with people who just carelessly give a movie a '10' rating, as if this movie is Citizen Kane. Come ON, people, show some friggin' sense of proportion, will you?!There's nothing remotely original about The Descent. The cheesy shock effects are the same as in every other horror movie, and can be seen coming a mile away. The premise is essentially exactly like all those underwater movies with a monster, combined with those backwood flicks about monstrously inbred hicks. Here we have some cavemen who never got out of the caves and evolved to live underground (when we saw the first one, I yelled 'It's Gollum!!'). This is in North America. Which wasn't populated by humans until the Native Americans crossed the Bering Strait some ten or twelve thousand years ago. There were never any actual cavemen in North America. So this part doesn't make sense.And the crawlers' not being about to hear or smell the girls when standing right next to them, or even stepping on them?! That was idiotic.Not much else in the film makes sense, either. Why do Sarah's husband and daughter die in the beginning if not to make this a story about Sarah overcoming that trauma? But no, this is cynical European 'realism', so nobody survives (in the original ending).And poor beautiful Juno, who had an affair with Sarah's husband - and not just some casual thing but a deeply held love -, still loved Sarah and wanted to strengthen their friendship. But, noooo, the movie sends the message that Juno is an awful person who deserves to die for her heinous crimes. Shyeah right. How moronic.And the six women. Hardly any character development at all. Hardly any sexy elements at all. With the introduction of Holly, the short-haired base jumper with an attitude, presented as 'Juno's... protegé', wink-wink, I was sure this was supposed to be a lesbian thing, but apparently it was nothing of the sort. As someone else said, no sleaze factor at all. It was played straight all the way. Another sign of pretentiousness. The characters were extremely hard to tell apart. Two of them were sisters, but I'll be buggered if I can remember who. Juno and Sam were good-looking; the rest were nothing particular to look at.Juno and Sarah made cool action chicks in the fight scenes towards the end, though. And the studio sets made for a very convincing and natural-looking cave system. But that's really the only good things I have to say about this movie.3 out of 10.",3,4,8,30 July 2006
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Clearly the least impressive of the MCU movies so far
","I'm a huge Marvel fan and comics collector, and I basically love every single MCU movie. All of them have been rated at least 8 stars out of 10 by me (except 'The Incredible Hulk', which was a 7 - and so was 'Captain America: Civil War', which I had a number of problems with). The first GOTG movie was a visual feast, but it did have a weakness: the story wasn't strong. However, what it lacked in story it made up for in world-building, action and sheer visual spectacle and splendor.GOTGv2 sadly could not live up to the first movie, and at 4 stars it is, for me, the worst MCU movie yet. The main problem with it was its story: it barely had any. They meet Ego, he turns out to be a bad guy, and they fight him. That's the story. No particular nuances, no significant subplots, nothing much that made any kind of sense. It was this really thin story, and the rest of the movie was held together by gags (of very varying quality), clichés and no tape. Sure, there was a string of brief fan service moments, but that's not enough to make a movie good.In this movie I wanted to see more characters. I expected a crammed movie, but there were about *one* new character: Mantis, and she had very little to do. They spent too much time on Yondu, for the wrong reasons (not because the story demanded it, but because Rooker is such a respected actor), far too much time on his deadly arrow which got way over-used here (it should have been saved for a really important moment), and although the sibling rivalry between Gamora and Nebula was my favorite part of the movie, Gamora generally had a very tiny role and was almost reduced to a mere love interest.We didn't land on any interesting planets (besides Ego), and the universe was not expanded. Ego says he came into existence alone, but also says he is a Celestial. Sadly, we are not told what Celestials are and how he can be one of them and be a unique and lonely being at the same time. The golden people from The Sovereign were a bunch of one-track a-holes. Why would they want to kill the GOTG when they've just saved the galaxy (them included) from Ego? No, most of what was in this movie just made no sense at all. Such a shame. I also dislike much of the humor, because it is too vulgar. James Gunn clearly has the gutter-mind of a 9-year-old (and yeah, this was also a problem in the first movie. Joss Whedon has some of the blame, as he encouraged Gunn to put more of his own humorous taste in the movies).So, only 4 stars out of 10. Lots of things to look at, and several funny and touching moments. But, this is the tongue-in-cheek village idiot of the MCU, and I really wish it were more serious. In this sequel we basically just get more low-brow jokes, more guffaws from Drax, more distinctly unheroic sadism from Rocket, etc. We get more of what was popular in the first movie, but less of what actually worked.",4,14,31,26 April 2017
The Da Vinci Code," Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle! It was great!
","I was one of those who considered myself too cool to read the book, and on hearing the bad reviews from Cannes I didn't exactly have great expectations for the movie, either. So when I saw the movie I was very surprised to find out what the story was actually about, and I totally loved it. This book and movie may be one of the greatest contributions to the debate on religion ever. And I mean EVER. It espouses a progressive, alternative version of Christianity, where the road to the divine goes through the woman. And while I am entirely aware that both the story and the Priory of Sion are fictitious, the movie (and hence the book) makes a surprisingly convincing case. Even if its specific argumentation is made up, the account it gives of the early history of Christianity may in fact be fairly accurate. Christianity, with its focus on marriage, has always essentially been an almost 'courtly love' kind of sentiment, intended among other things to protect the woman from the misogynistic cultures of 2000 years ago. However, those cultures were stronger than the Christian messages, and so Christianity was quickly warped into something where the woman was basically responsible for evil, original sin, etc., etc. Dan Brown's story goes the errand of restoring the woman's status and full equality, and this is a totally good and progressive and admirable thing. People who opine against this book and movie only risk exposing themselves as adherents to a misogynist world view, and I for one am tremendously gratified that this book and movie have had such massive success. It demonstrates that there are large parts of the culture today that embrace this progressive message, and that gives me increased hope for the future and betterment of mankind. Well done, Dan Brown!As for the movie itself, yes, there were a couple of things that were not as perfect as they might have been (mainly the disparate ages of the two main characters), but to me the power of the message overshadows any minor shortcomings the movie may have had. I found all the actors to be perfectly adequate, and the movie engaged me fully from start to finish. I have no choice but to award this movie the coveted 10 out of 10 rating.",10,2,4,25 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Ridiculously overrated crap
","Rating this or any other Potter movie thus far an 8 out of 10 can be described only as irrational hysteria. Every one of these movies suffers from a confused and flippant narrative structure bordering on the incoherent. I realize there is a larger and more detailed back-story in the books, but the movies should work on their own, and I don't think they do. They comprise, at best, mediocre (if often visually spectacular) fantasy adventures for children, executed in a manipulative and commercial style. If you want good, all-ages fantasy, see The 10th Kingdom.Specifically, I thought Harry Potter 4 was pretty much identical in quality (or lack thereof) to the previous three movies. I was left unmoved by all four movies, finding only Kenneth Branagh's 'Magical Me' character in the second movie to be amused about. I have rated every Potter movie a 4 out of 10, which amounts to just below mediocrity. There is nothing in these movies I can take seriously, much less be enthused about, and with such boring stories, no amount of great special effects can make any real difference.",4,0,1,23 November 2005
The Fountain," A homage to life - but not to human dreams and ingenuity
","The Fountain is undeniably an immensely beautifully filmed movie, but it is also a difficult film to understand. The other day, also at the Copenhagen International Film Festival, I saw Renaissance, which was about how we should not strive for immortality because that would dull and dilute mortal life. Funnily - and a bit anti-climactically -, The Fountain was about exactly the same.It was about a dying woman coming to terms with death by looking at it from the somewhat philosophical angle that every end of life is also the beginning of life. When you die, everything that was you continue in some other form. Your carcass will give nutrition to a tree. Your atoms, molecules and the very complementary bases of your DNA will become part of other life. It's one big cycle. And because of this, there is no need to desire continuous, individual immortality.I am not very satisfied with this rather simplistic message, wrapped in a bizarrely impenetrable wanna-be art movie. It may intend to be life-affirming, but it is also a conservative and resigned form of nature romanticism. We should just accept nature's ways and not desire anything more or better. Dalai Lama might well agree, but I do not. Humanity is meant to continue to interact ever more complexly with our environment, and adapt both it and ourselves to our preferences. Of course we should strive for a scientific understanding of our genetic make-up and do all we can to extend our lives. Buddhist self-abnegation is just another religion that will die out in competition with a scientific lifestyle which actually changes both our environment and ourselves.Based on the story and the deceptively obscure way of presenting it, I am forced to say that this disappointing movie deserves a 4 out of 10 rating. But because of the visually spectacular aspect, I will raise that to as much as a 6 out of 10. More than that I cannot grant it. This is not a timeless classic and will be no proper sci-fi fan's favorite movie.",6,5,13,2 October 2006
Love Actually," Yeah, profanity is soooo romantic...
","A rating for this movie of 7.8 is ludicrous. I'm glad to see that *some* others besides me finds this to be, well, drivel. And sexist. After watching this, what little respect I had left for Richard Curtis has been shredded good and well. It's a conundrum to me why this movie was such a success (no, actually it isn't: it's because of all the big name actors in it - no other reason. Well, except for the fact that most people have no taste); in my opinion it has all the hallmarks of a disaster. It is pretentious and over-sentimental, and in many scenes can't decide if it wants you to take them seriously or not. There are good bits here and there, but they are swallowed up by the tastelessness of the whole. I feel sorry for the frequently excellent Colin Firth that he's primarily getting known for horrendous comedy crap like this and that Bridget Jones tripe.3 out of 10.(Having said that, I must remark that the song towards the end by that kid, Olivia Olson, was fantastic. All I could think was 'Impossible! No 10-year-old can have such a voice!' But she has. I'm certainly going to get her debut album when it comes out, that's for sure.)",3,4,5,30 December 2004
Downfall," Good but could have been better
","Der Untergang was a good movie, but actually it did not quite live up to my expectations. First, I would have preferred a classic dramatic plot structure, rather than this docu-dramatization. The storytelling style was that of a bystander and not a filmmaker. I think the movie could have been much more effective with a more stylized narrative structure.Also, the movie didn't really go into the political philosophy aspects of Hitler's Nazi regime. There were tiny snippets of it in the dialogue, but the monstrosities, pseudo-science and sheer idiocy of the Nazi ideology were barely touched upon at all. And the Jews weren't even mentioned until the movie was almost over.I don't know the decisions underlying these choices of what to show and what not to, but I did not feel we got the whole story, nor an adequate impression of the nature of Nazism (and thus of Hitler). We got a personally focused 'reality'-style drama mostly set in a bunker - we got as incomplete a picture of the whole as some soldier who had been present in the bunker at the time would have gotten. Not a heck of a lot more.Still, it was a serious and no doubt cathartic movie (for the Germans), and it opened up some sore wounds and commenced the process of healing them. The acting was great, and I have no objection to showing Hitler with a human face - though a lot of people may not realize it, Hitler *was* a human being. The monstrosities he was part of was not wholly of his doing; it was to a very great degree a result of larger social trends in the population at large. No one among the ordinary people knew where it would go, so no one can be blamed. We can only learn from our mistakes and do our damnedest not to repeat them.7 out of 10.",7,6,16,17 March 2005
Hitch," Definitely above average, as romantic comedies go
","Will Smith stars quite admirably as Cupid in this romantic comedy about 'the basic principles' of love (claiming, at the end, that there are none, is just the movie being modest; it really is about showing the broad lines of those principles). It is well-written, keeps your attention and does contain several really good bits. There is also the usual sentimental fluff to keep the hopeless romantics in the audience happy, but this movie is also for guys. The previous comment claims that the movie paints a flawless image of women - this is completely wrong. The very climax of the movie is to criticize women for the way they condemn men for using tricks and tactics in the romantic process, when women are themselves far more guilty of the same thing. Men are usually being looked down upon for planning how to snag a girl because the assumption is that he's only doing it for sex. Will Smith's character in this movie is the other side of the coin, demonstrating a much needed truth to women who think that men are just pigs: some men actually want relationships and not just non-committal sex. And, the movie is also showing that most of the problem about getting a relationship off the ground is the way women needlessly mistrust men - and how this mistrust can get way out of hand and undermine true love. Especially when coupled with the despicable tabloid press, which, while often looking harmless, is the very definition of shallow. I mean, Smith and Mendez' characters really are quite shallow and superficial. The couple we care about is the awkward and overweight accountant and the not-unattainable-after-all heiress, who are the ones not only getting something extraordinary, but fulfilling their most hopeless yearnings, showing that nothing is impossible.All in all a better movie than I was expecting, with both substance and optimistic messages. I should probably rate it an 8 rather than a 7, but... I'm no big fan of romantic movies, and this one *could* have been a lot more poignant than it was. Although, considering today's standards in film writing, I have to say it was pretty good.",7,2,4,28 May 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Lucas failed
","Call me old-fashioned, but all the deadbeats who vote this movie a 10 without having seen it are really bugging me. That's sabotaging the ratings system. This movie is definitely not worth the current 8.1 rating.I just returned from the opening, and I was very disappointed. I consider myself a great Star Wars fan (having rated Episode IV a 10), but apart from the spectacular visuals, I found Revenge of the Sith neither exciting nor entertaining. I knew where the story was going, and it just kept on going there and going there, with no really surprising twists and turns. The amazing production values frankly mean absolutely squat when there's no interesting story to back it all up.Since one must rate a Star Wars movie according to how it relates to the other Star Wars movies, I am forced to let this final installment drag down the overall quality standard of these movies. I rate Episode III a 3, making it the second-worst of all the movies, out-done only by Episode I, which I rate a 2. My erstwhile 7 rating of Attack of the Clones will now be adjusted to 6 because of the disappointing finish which weakens the overall impression.Episode III was dull, dull, dull, and will not be one of those movies I sit through again and again. And no one is more sorry about this than I am.",5,5,9,18 May 2005
Prometheus," Hopefully, there's much more on the Blu-ray...
","I caught one of the earliest press screenings of Prometheus, which was a grand experience, as I am a complete and utter sci-fi nut. Prometheus was one of my two most anticipated movies of the year (the other being The Avengers), and there is not much doubt that it will go down as one of the, if not the, best science fiction movie of 2012.Prometheus is a bona-fide and direct prequel to the original 1979 Alien movie, giving us a portion of the story behind the space jockey; the alien pilot of the derelict spaceship that contained the alien eggs.Are the classic Giger aliens actually in this movie? No, but their precursors are. The aliens, after all, have always been evolving, taking on new shapes almost every time they incubate in a new host.Effectswise, action-wise, technically, visually and in terms of sense-of- wonder, this is exactly the movie we all hoped it would be. The whole set-up for the Weyland company is perfect and serves the first two original Alien movies (the good ones) extremely well. I would love to mention more, but it would be spoiling.The movie does have imperfections, though. Some salient points of the plot are never revealed (but left for a sequel, which, again, I hope gets made, as it will make a big difference as to how much sense this movie ends up making), and the motivation of the robot also remains enigmatic. The part I found most disappointing, however, is that there isn't much depth to the characters. The onslaught of the action doesn't leave them the necessary time to become properly human to us, and their various beliefs are not at all described in sufficient detail - although we do hear a bit about Shaw (Rapace's character). Besides her, and David, Idris Elba's captain is the best character; he is human, he has failings (yes, I count smoking as a failing!), he's a charmer, he can think and he understands sacrifice. Most of the other significant characters are scientists (finally, a sci-fi movie with more than one of those!), but, sadly they don't act like it. One is depressed and drinking for no good reason, one is just obnoxious, and one is apparently not interested in his own field of science. But, of course, they are all punished for their bad attitudes - which is something, I guess.But, I am hoping that various extra bits and bops on the disc release will rectify many of these little shortcomings, because, as it is in the movie's theatrical release, none of the characters live up to those of the first two Alien movies.It's still a great and brilliant movie, though, and one I know I will be going back to the cinema for, and get on Blu-ray as soon as it comes out, and rewatch many times. Most definitely a classic of the genre.(EDIT: The Blu-ray is out, and it has lots of extras, including some that make the salient points of the story more clear. I am very satisfied!)(EDIT II: Half a decade on, I think this movie holds up as one of the most distinctive and thought-provoking science fiction movies of the 2010s. It has so many beautifully filmed scenes, and so many amazing and mysterious ideas that I have upped my rating of it from 9 to 10 stars.)10 stars out of 10.",10,180,347,29 May 2012
Iron Man," Not too bad, not too good
","Iron Man was an okay movie. I went twice, and I'm thinking about going in for a third viewing. But I'm sorta disappointed, because I am a comics collector and I know how great a potential the character has. What we were given here - and I might be able to forgive Hollywood for it, but Marvel Studios? - was a movie where the acting worked very well, and things looked good, but the plot and story were mediocre at best. The origin story was too long and not 'important' enough - I mean, why would this terrorist guy make Tony Stark build him a Jericho missile when he already had several of them (we *see him using them* later in the movie)? Just to get one more? And that's the whole setting for the situation that creates Iron Man? I'm sorry, but that's effin' thin. No points for cleverness there. The visual effects were very good, but I say again that the story was too thin. Too many scenes were too predictable, incl. much of the end. And though the acting was good, the characters had little depth, especially Stane. It's cool enough that they used the Iron Monger story from Iron Man #200 (which came out in 1985 and was the culmination of a long story arc), but it would have been much cooler if they'd introduced Stane as Stark's partner and waited until the second or third movie to have him come out of the closet as a villain. And now that terrorist guy (who's supposed to be The Mandarin, Iron Man's arch-nemesis) is apparently going to build an army of Iron Men, or something like that, for the next movie, making the villains in that one armored as well. Can we please stop filling up Iron Man movies with Iron Man knock-offs? God knows there're enough of them in the comics. At least pick the more interesting ones, like the Mandroids or the Guardsmen.Actingwise, the news is almost all good. Downey Jr. performs to near-perfection and is very believable. Most of the cast is very good, right down to the guy playing Agent Coulson. I only have two gripes, one small and one bigger. The smaller is that Gwyneth Paltrow is a bit wasted on too small a role. Sure, it's an important role, and she plays it superbly, but... I don't know, I just think there should be a bit more to her role than this. More screen time, certainly. Well, maybe in the next movie. The bigger gripe is the only one of the actors who doesn't work for me at all: the guy playing James Rhodes. He's not right. He's not the cool, no-nonsense, hands-on, likable, masculine, pilot grunt that he is in the comics. His own man, a Han Solo-like scoundrel and ladies' man. Oh no, in the movie he's a big-time establishment stooge; a member of the weapons-industrial complex, a typical narrow-minded army man, speaking in an ever so slightly nasal voice. And I hate to pull the color card, but he's not as dark as he is in the comics. Why are Black comics characters always lighter - or should that be whiter - in the movie versions (cf. Storm in X-Men)? Well, what they've done, character-wise, is to turn Rhodey into the War Machine character from the horrifically bad '90s run, where he had a (never satisfactorily explained) falling out with Stark and got his own comic book. So the movie Rhodey is that guy; a weapons freak whose personality is inconsistent with the one he had in the far superior '80s stories. Nobody's got Zagnut anymore...So you see, there are things to complain about here. That Marvel Studios have focused more on the actors than the substance of the story shows you how much they care about the comics: about zilch. They just want to do a commercially successful movie. Make money. Bah! They're as evil as the cigarette manufacturers Ezekiel Stane blew away in Invincible Iron Man #1! Ha! :-)Anyway. Entertaining movie, if rather short of perfect. But enough for a 8 rating. The next one will probably be better. Against the odds, I remain optimistic. It's the only way to live!",10,1,3,11 May 2008
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Bat-boring, super-disappointing non-delivery
","Just as with people who liked the retread that was The Force Awakens, I just cannot comprehend at all that so many fan boys are trying to convince themselves that BvS is a good (or God forbid, great) movie. It is a *terrible* movie, shock-full of absurd shortcomings. You never feel anything at all for any of the characters; the storytelling is completely horrid and unconvincingly self-important. All characters besides the two mains feel like they're only there as brief vignettes; there is zero sense of their being part of an actual, on-going narrative. And I'm saying this as a long-time comic book reader and collector; as a big superhero fan. Here's just a few of the movie's many problems (and yes, there are a few spoilers here):<ul><li>Was Batman's stealing the kryptonite a part of Luthor's plan? It didn't seem to be, yet it played a key part in Luthor's plan to pit Batman against Superman. So, huh? I call that a plot hole.</li></ul><ul><li>How did Luthor learn Superman's secret identity? This wasn't explained.</li></ul><ul><li>How did Batman find Martha Kent in the undisclosed location? Not explained.</li></ul><ul><li>So many story elements were just included as throw-aways, incl. the big thing at the end. That's completely meaningless. And speaking of the final fight, Superman should not have been able to carry that spear. He was vulnerable to it; there were two other major characters who could have carried it without being affected by it; it's more logical that one of them would have done it. Only, if they had, we wouldn't have gotten that nonsensical shock-value throw-away ending.</li></ul>Almost nothing worked in this movie. Mindless action, no characterization, ridiculous pacing, overwrought stylism with no substance. Who the hell likes this sort of stuff? I liked about two things about this movie. I liked the early sequence with the flash- back to Metropolis being destroyed by Zod's people in the first movie; it was visually spectacular in a way that worked. The other thing I liked was Luthor's overall character arc. He pits the two mains against each other (thus providing a proper explanation for why they fight, which really needed one!) and he's aware of the more cosmic implications of what's going on, unlike the other characters. However, I didn't particularly like Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal of him. I don't have anything against Eisenberg (I loved him in The Social Network), but the way he played Luthor as some kind of insecure, twitchy psycho just seemed stilted and artificial to me. Neither he nor any of the other characters, except Wonder Woman, felt anywhere near real or relatable. The romance between Clark and Lois also fell flat; we are introduced to it in the beginning of the movie, but apart from two kisses along the way, there is no feeling whatsoever in the course of the movie that these two are in a relationship. All the characters just feel dead.It's a shame. I was hoping to like this movie. I wasn't overly fond of Man of Steel, but I didn't hate it, either; I rated it a 7 out of 10. BvS is much worse and can garner only a 2. This DC Murderverse movie is just incredibly terrible. I never thought we would get a movie compared with which Man of Steel looks like a wholesome, competent, better story, but that is what we have gotten. Most people will agree with this appraisal in the fullness of time, no doubt.",2,19,47,23 March 2016
Casino Royale," Massively superficial
","I am not a Bond fan. I have watched most of the Bond movies, and to me virtually all of them are silly and nonsensical to the point of the preposterous. Sometimes they try to put some comedy and satire in there to make the lack of realism more endurable, but this rarely works. It consistently panders too much to the lowest common denominators.And it's not because I'm not a fan of far-out action movies - I am! I happily watch a lot of Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Seagal and Jackie Chan movies, and I thought Mission Impossible II was a better Bond movie than any Bond movie. And hell, so was The Bourne Identity.But this new Bond movie? You know, I thought, from the almost uniformly good reviews and the obvious change in style, that Casino Royale might be different from the other Bond movies. And it was: It was bad for a lot of different reasons. Well, and a few of the same reasons, too.I admit it had acting. But it had absolutely no story. And it was *incredibly* dull. Most of the action was not impressive, and the love story ended up not working. It would have worked if Vesper Lynd had been in earnest league with the bad guys. But she wasn't. She was forced into it. So why does that constitute an immense betrayal that lays the foundation for Bond's 'disposable' attitude to women? Nope, it doesn't make a lick of sense. And this was the only thing in the movie with any chance of making sense, since we don't know who the bad guys were and obviously aren't supposed to care. This is immensely bad writing. I left the theater with a feeling of having taken absolutely nothing worthwhile with me from it. Even as aptly-called 'empty entertainment', this movie had nothing to offer me, and it left me largely indifferent.Note that in knocking this movie I'm not knocking Daniel Craig. I always thought he'd do a good job, and he did do a decent one. But he's not charismatic enough to truly carry a movie as superficial as this, the way it badly needed to be held aloft. And as for Mads Mikkelsen, of whom, as a Dane, I am naturally a huge fan; his decent performance did little to sway me in this movie's favor. He was intense in the torture scenes, but the poker scenes were themselves dangerously close to audience torture.And as for Eva Green - hate to say it, but she's just not my type. She doesn't do a thing for me. She's kinda pretty, sure, and she can act, sure, but she's not my idea of a good-looking woman. (She did resemble Ursula Andress - who's not my type, either - a good deal, though.) She exudes a kind of aristocratic daintiness that I just have zero interest in. Now, young Jacqueline Bisset as Ms. Goodthighs in the 1967 movie - *she* was a sizzler! Anyway - another problem I have with the new Casino Royale was the drowning scene. Was a disgustingly protracted death scene really necessary? No, and it was, in my opinion, in damn poor taste.Sorry, but my personal experience of watching this movie was that it was almost as dull as drying paint, and had less coherence. The only thing that was remotely well done was the acting and some of the characterization, and that's not even enough for this movie to approach mediocrity. I am at a complete loss to understand why it garnered rave reviews from virtually all quarters. Did the reviewers see a different movie than I did? Must have. To see here on IMDb that half of everybody who watched this so far have rated it a 10 out of 10 is the closest I have ever come to suspecting really foul play with the ratings here. I have great difficulty believing that so many people found this movie so good. Or maybe this movie is simply seen mostly by people who have no discerning bone in their body, and can only rate movies either a 1 or a 10. Barring a conspiracy, that has to be the explanation.3 out of 10.",3,7,14,23 November 2006
La Vie En Rose," Great singer or decrepit alcoholic? Movie does not paint a flattering picture
","I was not very happy with this movie as I was watching it. However, I admit the final scene worked well. I did get the emotional surge from the song at the end, and realized that the entire movie was a set-up for that moment; that they used that song to portray her life through.Still, this only raised my rating from a 5 to a 6. I have many problems with the movie. Firstly, why was Piaf made up to look like a clown? Yes, a clown. Big (fake-looking) white forehead, big red lips, and in at least one scene a white jacket with big white buttons! Did the historical Piaf actually strive to look clownish? Or was this the film-makers' idea? Or didn't they even realize they were doing it? I'm confused. In any case, I found it unfortunate. Secondly, far too much of the movie was about the last and very health-deteriorated part of her life. Where's the point in that?? We want to see her prime! See her at her best! I can't for the life of me see how this movie is much of a homage to Piaf. Why show all her human failings that she has in common with half of mankind? We want to see what was SPECIAL about her!!The movie seemed to me to be more interested in being educational than entertaining, and I did not agree with that. The narrative structure attempted to be smart and innovative, but I thought it was mostly just messy. At the end we suddenly have a dead child and an unknown extra husband thrust into it. And throughout the movie there were details that were never explained. Who was that song-pimp she worked for? How did she get involved with him, and how did she finally get free of him? No explanation.My main gripe with the movie, though, is Marion Cotillard. I am a huge fan of her. She is easily one of the most beautiful actresses in France. I went to see the movie because of her. And what do they do? They make her ugly! Hunched over, big over-bite with rabbit teeth, decrepit and old for huge stretches of the movie! I mean, I know they needed to have the main character actually look somewhat like the historical Piaf, but, newsflash: then they should have picked an actress who in fact looked the part!! Ruining the gorgeous Cotillard for this role is a mistake of epochal proportions. No offense to Marion, who pulled out all the stops in terms of acting, which I commend her for, but I don't think she should have played this part. It seems to me that the film-makers wanted to do like the Americans and have some actress change her appearance radically (like Nicole Kidman for The Hours, or Charlize Theron for Monster), and garner huge applause for it like Anthony Hopkins in Nixon and such. Well, I guess Marion pulled it off, but at the cost of destroying most of what was appealing about her to begin with. Something like that I cannot applaud. Not with her. I just can't.",6,6,16,26 April 2007
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," What really makes this movie is the hand-crafted models
","Let's all be thankful that today's computer effects did not exist when Lucas made the original Star Wars trilogy, because if they had then the original movies would have looked as bleh as the new ones. With the new trilogy, Lucas proves once and for all that he himself doesn't even understand what was good about the original movies. The original Star Wars movies are cool because they create a convincing, alien culture. Everything looks used, rugged and thousands of years old! It's believable as the surroundings of a five-thousand year-old and truly alien culture. It creates a timeless impression.The new movies, on the other hand, are nothing but run-of-the-mill 'hot right now' special effects which will look dated in a couple of years. The look they achieve is generic futurism as we always imagine it, all sleek, silvered and aero-dynamic, all devoid of imagination. Fie on it, I say!!The new trilogy does not deseve to exist. Lucas you fiend, how much did Hollywood pay you to kill your imagination?!",10,2,3,30 May 2007
300," An adaptation too faithful to make a great movie - but it was OK
","I am a comic collector, and I'm not really a big Frank Miller fan. I love his Daredevil from the early '80s, but I haven't really liked anything of his since then. I read '300' when I was visiting a friend a couple of years ago, but I didn't think it was much good. I'm no fan of Miller's ideas about violence and manhood; it all seems a bit sadistic and, well, black and white. Miller acknowledges this; he has said that he is an artist (i.e. a 'drawer') at heart, so he draws what he likes to draw, and then just makes up some story to go with it. Fair enough - that's his business. He can do as he likes. And apparently a lot of people like it. I'm just not one of them.I did go to see the movie, however - as a comic collector, going to see comics-based movies kind of comes with the territory. I expected something pretty entertaining, at least visually, since the trailers looked amazing. The adaptation had translated the special comic book style into a special, but different, motion picture style, and I was interested in seeing how well this was done. Again, the trailers were extremely promising.The movie was fairly entertaining, but I must say I am disappointed. The story just didn't grab me very much; there wasn't much character development (every Spartan except Leonidas and his captain were practically completely faceless and anonymous) or interesting elements to identify with or engage oneself in. The pacing suffered a lot from the constant slow-motion scenes which I felt comprised a much too great desire on the part of the director to mimic the exact comic-book panels, even to the degree of punctuating the action and the narrative flow of the movie's story. So I would call this a too faithful adaptation of the comic.I also thought the story had more general problems. The style and the basic concept were enormously promising, but I didn't feel they lived up to that promise at all. The movie could have been so much more effective in terms of action, excitement, intensity, human spirit and climax. Sure, there were a few cool things, and Gerard Butler himself (incl. his cool Scottish accent) was very good. But both the substance of the story and the overall pacing and storytelling were just not good enough to draw me into the story and make me feel anything for it. Stylistically, as a first effort and an experiment, it was OK. It was fairly entertaining and visually interesting. But it could have been so much more.Oh well, we can't have everything.7 out of 10.",9,7,12,3 April 2007
Fantastic Four," Fantastic movie - it made my whole day!
","What you need to know is this: They stayed true to the comic-book! Sure, Dr. Doom was changed, but he's been pretty much ruined in the comic over the years, so I think it was the right choice to reinvent him for the movie. The other characters remained intact in virtually every detail, and the movie was generally *great*. If you have any interest in superheroes and larger-than-life concepts, forget about the bad reviews. Those critics are just not sensitive to this stuff.I have been reading FF comics for twenty years, so I was understandably worried that Hollywood would mess up this movie as well, as they've done with several other comics-based movies (esp. Elektra - argh!). But I also retained my optimism - fueled by the excellent trailers -, and despite the almost unanimously terrible reviews, I went in to this movie with high hopes. And throughout the movie, as no bad scenes or twists came along, my enthusiasm just kept climbing. Hey, maybe the Hollywood suits found the original story too complex to mess with, and left well enough alone?! For once!In any case, this movie joins X-Men and Spider-Man as a truly successful new film franchise based on classic Marvel comics - and because the FF concept is just so much more grand and colorful and sci-fi-like than the regular-joe grounding of Spider-Man and the murky, moody mutants, I'd have to say that Fantastic Four is my favorite Marvel movie yet. A fantastic romp!Every actor was totally great (although I would rather have seen Elisha Cuthbert as Sue). Especially Johnny Storm, who was far better than I'd expected. The bickering between Ben and Johnny was also GREAT. Just right. Beautiful. I don't understand why many critics found it boring - I thought it had lots of sting.OK, the movie wasn't 100% perfect. There could have been a stronger focus on Reed and his great intellect. There could have been a slightly better dialog in places, and various plot points could have been better explained (like, Doom really only cures Ben so he can leech the cosmic energy off of him, and he does - so how can the human Ben just go back and become the Thing again, if his cosmic radiation went into Doom...? Well, I just would have liked this point to have been addressed). But overall a delightful, highly entertaining movie - if you belong to the true target audience! ;-)I rate the FF movie a very solid 8 out of 10 - and I'm very close to pushing that up to a 9!",8,1,3,4 August 2005
Sin City," Well-made? Yes. Impressive? Yes. Great? No.
","I am a comic collector, and while I never really liked Sin City (just not my sort of thing), I have read some of it, and know what it's like. In terms of the type of story, the type of characters and the type of storytelling, the movie is (and was supposed to be) pretty much *exactly* like the comic. Everything I didn't like about the comic, I didn't like about the movie, either. This is mainly the sadism parts, and the rather bleak view of humanity.Still, I was impressed with the way the characters from the comic were fleshed out by such big-name actors (particularly Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson and Elijah Wood). Stylistically, it was an interesting exercise, and I also liked the fact that quite a lot happened. In most recent comics, nothing much happens per issue, due to the extremely annoying post-modern trend of 'decompressed storytelling'. But a lot happened here, and that was quite satisfying.The city of hookers who protected themselves with all manners of weaponry (incl. a bloody ninja!) was very hard to take seriously in any way. It was quite ridiculous; if they had that kind of power, why be hookers in the first place? (I don't think it was a misogynist movie, though - I didn't see any proof of that. Perhaps a good deal of rather pathetic male chauvinist wishful thinking, but that's not misogyny.)More generally speaking, I have to say I question the wisdom of attempting to do a movie which is so close to the comic as this one was supposed to be. Comics and movies are different media. This stark black&white style in a movie suggests a kind of stilted surrealism for its own sake, rather than the powerful and atmospheric messages conveyed by the art style in the comic. A voice-over in a movie just doesn't make it out for a text caption in a comic. Both the comic and the movie use the style to distance the reader/viewer from the starkness of the violence, but in the movie it is much more in-your-face because the story is live-action. Although this is in many ways an impressive movie, it was not one I particularly enjoyed, nor one that I particularly care to see again. But it was well-made and beautifully stylized; these things are undeniable.My rating: 7 out of 10.",5,0,2,27 April 2005
Moon," What on the moon are you on about, people??
","I just have zero understanding for the praise you lunatics are lavishing on this film. I caught a festival showing many moons ago, and was quite disappointed. So he's a clone. That supposed to be a big deal? What about the ridiculous premise: Earth government says, 'Hey, yeah, how about having a manned moon base, but manned by just one guy, and oh, let's make him a clone who thinks he's a natural person!!' Uhhh... That's ludicrous. There's no way anyone would do that. And as the premise goes, so goes the rest of the movie.It's a nice production, but ultimately far too silly to be in any way believable. 5 out of 10. A disappointment. A big one.",5,3,14,28 December 2009
The Island," How, I ask, was it 'thought-provoking'??
","People's average rating of this movie as around 7 out of 10 is proof that Hollywood's brain-dead action formula works. It puts asses in seats, and thrills them. No matter how devoid of any proper contents it is.The Island was a huge disappointment to me. The sci-fi story wasn't taken seriously at all; it was simply an excuse for a meaningless, standard action movie. Sure, there were some cool scenes (which is the only reasons I'm rating this movie a 3 out of 10 after all), but there were far more laughable ones. Take the story. It had no depth, no discernible kind of symbolism, made no statement of any note, and was founded on gaping plot holes. Yeah, it's very popular to say that a story has plot holes, but it's less common to actually list them. So that's what I'll do:1. The movie could not have been made without the clones having conscious lives. How did they explain the need for this? By saying that if they didn't have some semblance of proper lives, their organs would atrophy. This is bull. People can be kept alive indefinitely without a conscious life. Even brain-dead people can be kept alive.2. The movie could not have been made without the rebellion of Echo and his generation, which was caused by their suddenly developing the memories of their original human hosts! How??? Never explained. Because it can't be explained.3. The suppression of sexual urges. How was this done? Not explained. How was that suppression circumvented so the two mains could discover sex? Not explained.4. The subplot with Jordan's human host being dying was never developed. A lot could have been done with that, but it was basically just completely ignored.Those were the worst plot holes (and don't call them 'artistic license' - they were purely commercial license). But there were more. There was a cool scene of Lincoln and Jordan fighting each other in some kind of video game. Why O Why didn't they use any of these fight skills when they were pursued by the bad guys??? Why smack a pursuer with a wrench when Jordan could have scissor-kicked his head off???? Of all the wasted opportunities... And also, since Jordan's human host was a celebrity out in the real world, appearing in a big public commercial and having been in at least three men's magazines, how come nobody on the street recognized her?Much of the extremely protracted action in this movie was the usual baaad kind of movie action that's been done to death - oooh, the bad guy conveniently slips on some pellets! Oooh, the heroes fall off a skyscraper but miraculously land in some conveniently placed net! Cripes, that bleedin' sucks! I can't believe I'm even giving this movie 3 stars. It was the worst kind of popular tripe Hollywood has turned out since... well, since the last crappy action movie. Gah.",3,14,28,12 August 2005
