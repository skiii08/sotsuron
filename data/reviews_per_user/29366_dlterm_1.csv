The Benchwarmers," Funny film!
","I don't know what that Dutchmen's ax is (that he obviously needs to grind), but I am guessing that he never saw the movie. Jon Lovitz doesn't have a 'cameo'...he has a substantial part in the film.I watched it today at an advanced screening and laughed my ass off. It is nicely paced and I had a smile on my face throughout the entire film. I am not a big fan of Spade, but I liked him in this roll and Schnider actually shows some range...go figure!(Good director? probably...but, will have to see Schnider in his next movie) Cute chicks, some laughs, baseball, fart jokes, and Lovitz drives a couple of cars that can't be topped for coolness. Get some popcorn, a soda and don't expect 'The Natural' ...you will have a great time at Benchwarmers.",7,12,26,31 March 2006
