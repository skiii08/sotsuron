Moneyball," Brad Pitt and co. get the job done
","For a movie where the most memorable line is 'How can you not be romantic about baseball?', Moneyball is surprisingly unsentimental. Granted, it features its fair share of rousing montages, some glossy cinematography courtesy of Inception's Wally Pfister and a quietly wistful score, but – and this should be made very clear to prospective viewers – it's not your typical, inspirational sports flick.Then again, Billy Beane and the 2002 Oakland Athletics didn't exactly conform to the typical underdog narrative. After suffering a tough loss to the New York Yankees that eliminated them from the playoffs and losing their three star players, the A's began to drastically rebuild their team by putting numbers and stats over perceived star power, hoping to compete with their better-budgeted rivals by taking players that, for various reasons, were undervalued by others. They went on to win their division in a year highlighted by a record-making, 20 game win streak, only to be defeated, once again, in the early postseason. Not quite a storybook ending. Director Bennett Miller and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, who reworked a script by Steve Zaillain, are bold enough to not sugarcoat or ignore this anticlimactic finish (in one scene, Beane contends that a failure to win the World Series would mean all of their hard work has been wasted); fortunately, they're also savvy enough to pull it off. This risk represents one of many elements of Moneyball, from Brad Pitt's comically short and to-the-point take on the traditional locker room motivational speech to emotional moments that are understated rather than melodramatic and grand, that transcend or avoid the clichés that usually plague the genre. The film-makers care about telling the story they've been given instead of tweaking it to make it more crowd-pleasing. The result is an effervescent and keenly observed portrait, imbued with nostalgia and optimism in equal measure, of America's Favorite Pastime.In another daring move, Moneyball takes viewers off the field and focuses the majority of the action behind-the-scenes, largely confining the actual games to effective and well-edited montages that intercut real footage, both visual and audio, with recreations. The business side of baseball has rarely been portrayed on film in great detail, and such subject material could easily have led to a dull, textbook-dry movie. Enter Aaron Sorkin. Though his dialogue here isn't as knock-you-down, 99 mph-fastball quick as in The Social Network, it still zips along effortlessly, drawing both humor and drama out of situations where you'd expect to see neither. He avoids sentimentality and leaves room for audiences to judge the events and the characters for themselves.Still, the indisputable MVP is Brad Pitt. Over the years, he's proved himself to be much more than a pretty face, tackling challenging, complex and (usually) supporting roles when he could have simply coasted on his heartthrob status, and 2011's combined one-two punch of The Tree of Life and, now, Moneyball can only further cement his reputation as one of those rare actors with star power and talent in equal measure. In arguably the best lead performance of his career, Pitt portrays Billy Beane as flawed and decidedly human, a pleasant contrast to the bigger-than-life, almost saintly geniuses that frequently dominate sports movies. Outwardly, he's competitive, shrewd and stubborn almost to the point of arrogance, a forceful and assertive presence in the A's organization, but on the inside, he's plagued by doubts (what if this gamble doesn't work the way he'd imagined?) and regrets (he passed on Stanford to sign with the New York Mets only to crash and burn as a player at the major league level). He's a caring father to his 12 year old daughter, Casey, played with surprising aplomb and believability by Kerris Dorsey, but a divorce from her mother (Robin Wright, in a role that could've been filled by an extra) suggests that his personal life has seen its share of bumps along the way. Pitt sinks into this character with verve, and there isn't a moment when his performance feels unnatural or actor-ly. It's a work of subtlety, perhaps too quiet to earn him the Oscar attention many have started talking him up for, but worthy of notice nonetheless.Also deserving of a shout-out is Jonah Hill who plays it straight to admirable results, while also garnering some deadpan laughs. As Peter Brand, a fill-in for the real-life Paul DePodesta, who gives Beane the idea to run his team using sabermetrics and subsequently becomes an assistant to the general manager for the A's, Hill provides an ideal nerdy but not socially-inept (thank God) foil to Pitt's more boisterous jock.As a huge baseball fan (Nats and/or Rangers, anyone?), I went into Moneyball with mixed expectations. What I wanted was a tribute to baseball, an homage, if you will, that captures the complexity of the game, the constantly simmering tension, the exhilaration and feeling of unity and camaraderie that has me and other die-hards hooked. However, the possibility that it would actually accomplish this seemed dim. It seems fair to say that baseball's glory has faded a bit. America no longer seems as infatuated with the sport as in decades past, and Hollywood has been no different. The last well-received baseball movie was The Rookie in 2002. Since then, any offerings, let alone good ones, have been few and far in between. Also mixed in with that hope and skepticism was the fear that I'd get too caught up in noticing minor inaccuracies and technicalities to truly appreciate the movie, though had it been genuinely not good, that would've been a different story. It's a testament to the quality of Bennett Miller's film that, at some point pretty early on, my critical eye relaxed and I allowed myself to get caught up in the tale of Billy Beane and the Oakland A's. The fussing and nitpicking can be left to the real experts. It wasn't perfect, but I had a blast nonetheless.",8,4,8,29 September 2011
The Avengers," Fanboys and girls, after years of anticipation, you can finally breathe
","I'll confess that I had reservations about The Avengers: the Marvel superhero movies have been a mixed bag for me so far, and the notion of a big-budget action spectacle centered on not just one but six protagonists, all of whom should theoretically get an equal amount of attention, sounded like a formula for disaster. At best, I assumed that it would be a fun slice of escapism that critics would treat with a mix of condescension and grudging acceptance. At worst, it would be the most ambitious fiasco since well, John Carter, though that had the benefit of low expectations. If The Avengers was anything but the cinematic equivalent of a walk-off grand slam in Game 7 of the World Series, blood would surely be spilt.To my – and no doubt tons of other people's – relief, neither of those predictions turned out to be right. Not only is The Avengers a blast to watch, an explosive mix of humor, angst and awesome fight scenes, but it's also maybe one of the best superhero movies of all-time. Take notes, Hollywood: this is how you make a summer blockbuster. Despite clocking in at approximately two-and-a-half hours, The Avengers never fails to mesmerize, barreling headlong into the chaos like an enraged Hulk loose in Manhattan yet also giving its numerous heroes sufficient room to breathe and flex their ridiculously chiseled muscles. This is a ticking time bomb of a movie. Each scene brims with energy, an exhilarating, carefree vivacity that would probably be overwhelming if not for those little moments of unexpected pathos strewn here and there that leave you breathless. Joss Whedon, the geek idol whose previous credits include beloved cult TV shows Firefly and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, displays astonishing dexterity as he juggles over-the-top action set pieces with incisive, often self-deprecating banter and emotional turmoil. He treats the material at once with ironic self-awareness and the utmost respect, indulging the so-called fanboys without pandering to them, winking at the absurdity while making his passion for the characters and their stories palpable. There lies the key to first-rate superhero movies, something few directors seem to have realized: they may have godlike powers, but deep down, superheroes are still human (well, Thor is technically an actual god, but you get my point). Whedon refuses to glorify his characters, showing them in all their messy imperfections and weaknesses so that they feel less like the flat archetypes that often dominate superhero movies than like real people.Nonetheless, the star of The Avengers is its phenomenal cast. If there's one thing that has remained consistent throughout the Marvel movies, it's the acting; The Incredible Hulk was saved single-handedly from utter mediocrity by Edward Norton's compelling performance, and even Iron Man 2 had Scarlett Johansson kicking ass and Sam Rockwell devouring scenery. You might think that stuffing so much (good-looking) talent into one 143-minute movie would be overkill, like forcing a pack of wolves to share one rabbit. On the contrary, the acting is what truly elevates The Avengers above 'just another superhero movie', what makes it so compulsively watchable. Watching the actors – Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johannson, Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo, Samuel L. Jackson and Tom Hiddleston – together on screen is a positively mind-blowing experience. As a group, their chemistry is fiery enough to light a small city, and as individuals, they alternately ooze charisma and vulnerability. I was particularly impressed by Johannson, who manages to exude feminist empowerment while fighting in a body-hugging leather suit, and Hiddleston, he of the startlingly expressive eyes and deliciously smug smirk, though it seems unfair to pick and choose when you have a cast as uniformly wonderful as this one. This is ensemble acting at its finest.That said, I did have a few relatively minor problems. Given the fact that the majority of the movie does such a great job of balancing the action, comedy and drama, I found the climax a tad underwhelming. As pretentious as it sounds, I wish Whedon had supplemented the epic, CGI-heavy, property damage-laden battle sequence (which was thrilling, don't get me wrong) with something more emotionally resonant. It seems like a letdown to spend over two hours building these relationships, only to set them aside at the end. Judging from the audience reaction at my screening, though, most people didn't have an issue with this. Also, a familiarity with or a fondness for the previous Marvel films is preferable since The Avengers assumes that viewers already have some sort of relationship with the characters.In two months, the Internet will inevitably be filled with debates over whether The Avengers is better than The Dark Knight Rises (The Amazing Spider-Man might join them, but to be honest, that one doesn't have the same level of anticipation as the others). And, if you'll allow me to be cynical for a second, those debates will inevitably boil down to this: The Dark Knight Rises is the serious, gritty one about timely political issues, whereas The Avengers is the fun, lighthearted one about s--- blowing up. Although both of those descriptions are accurate to some extent, they do a disservice to both movies. Counter to popular opinion, it's entirely possible to like Christopher Nolan's Batman films as pure entertainment rather than profound social commentaries, and although it may not have the thematic depth of The Dark Knight, The Avengers deserves to be taken more seriously than run-of-the-mill escapist fluff. Not only does it show (once again) that there is room in action blockbusters for actual acting, but it also makes an ardent case for the importance of superheroes: especially in our post-9/11 world of constant anxiety, they provide a comforting dose of old-fashioned values, hope for salvation from the anarchy. It's unashamed optimism, as opposed to The Dark Knight's secret idealism. Superheroes aren't here to save us from monsters, it says. They're here to save us from ourselves.",8,4,10,16 May 2012
Black Swan," Dancing the fine line between beauty and horror
","Black Swan should not have worked. It mixes so many different tones and genres - it's a sports-movie-like tale of an underdog fighting to achieve the seemingly impossible, a twisted psychological thriller about deception and paranoia and a dark coming-of-age story about a young woman discovering her sexual and emotional limits - that on paper, it looks like a disaster waiting to happen. Even many of the film's admirers admit that it is, to some extent, campy, B-movie trash. And yet, in large part due to the indie/artistic sensibilities of director Darren Aronofsky, it is also one of the most intriguing and haunting films of this year.The film unfolds like an extravagant ballet, relying more heavily on visuals to entrance the viewer than plot or dialogue. Many of the movie's most memorable sequences have little, if any, speaking, instead using a kaleidoscope of striking images as well as Clint Mansell's beautifully sinister score to create a suspenseful, dream-like atmosphere. With breathtaking dexterity, Aronofsky manipulates every technical aspect of his medium - from the murky lighting to the elegantly designed costumes and sets - in order to reflect the film's themes of appearance verses reality and self-discovery. Notice, for instance, the abundance of mirrors or the frequent use of black and white clothing or even the sleek cinematography, which conflicts with the more grisly subject matter; such painstaking attention to detail transforms Black Swan into an intricate maze of metaphors and hidden implications that any ardent film critic could spend hours dissecting.Even the actors exude mystique and ambiguity as they all portray characters that, at least ostensibly, consist of a baffling medley of nuances, contradictions and riddles, their true natures disguised under a perpetual veil. The supporting players are especially enigmatic: as Thomas Leroy, Vincent Cassel emanates both sophistication and a quiet depravity; Barbara Hershey portrays the protagonist's mother as amorous yet overbearing, driven to the brink of hysteria by the need to protect (or control) her daughter; lastly, Mila Kunis is pitch-perfect as Lily, a mysterious new ballerina, embodying her with the correct balance of charisma and menace. Nonetheless, the star of the show is inarguably Natalie Portman, who, in a luminous, career-best performance, fully embodies the obsessive ballerina Nina Sayers and the numerous paradoxes she exemplifies – her ruthlessness, her vulnerability, her passion, her innocence. Together, the actors play a cast of characters who feel real yet somehow elusive, and like the movie itself, we never quite know whether to trust them.However, the debate at the heart of the movie – or at least the one most likely to spark controversy – is the way in which it totters between art (as in an 'art film') and exploitation. Even knowing beforehand about the much-hyped lesbian sex scene, I still found myself disgusted, shocked or simply confounded by many moments in Black Swan, especially those involving Leroy's none-too-subtle attempts to seduce Nina, and at my screening, some scenes provoked laughter from the audience; whether this was intentional or not, I couldn't tell. How much is too much? As directors seek to expand their boundaries and experiment, the question of how much violence/sex/profanity constitutes too much comes up more and more often. At times, the gore depicted in Black Swan verged on sickening, something that seemed more fit for 'torture porn' like the Saw franchise than a highbrow indie film, and no doubt many critics have denounced it as little more than second-rate horror disguised as 'art'. Nonetheless, there is something beguiling about Black Swan, something that separates it from countless other pretentious art-house films that take themselves too seriously. This is, after all, a movie about contrasts and boundaries and the ambiguous nature of reality. Even from the opening scene, the viewer senses that beneath the glamorous surface, darkness simmers, and Aronofsky does a masterful job of gradually heightening the tension, bit by bit revealing the film's grotesque soul, until by the climax, the viewer is entangled in a tumult of deceit and fantasy. It is a testament to Darren Aronofsky's talent that we can always sense a purpose behind the madness. Although graphic and disturbing, like a gorgeously rendered nightmare, Black Swan lingers with you long after its last image fades.",8,2,6,5 January 2011
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Tedious, my dear Watson
","The world's favorite detective has gotten a makeover. Gone is Arthur Conan Doyle's intelligent, resourceful, eccentric creation, and in his place, we have gotten a swashbuckling, wisecracking, (still) eccentric action hero in the vein of Jack Sparrow. This is Sherlock Holmes for a 21st century audience, complete with all the explosions, gunfights and hand-to-hand combat you've always wanted from the 19th century British investigator but have never before gotten. At least that seems to be the train of thought taken by Guy Ritchie, who first introduced audiences to this updated Sherlock in 2009 in a film that was fairly successful, particularly considering it went head-to-head with James Cameron's Avatar juggernaut. Certainly, Ritchie's take is a breath of fresh air after so many decades of deerskin caps and frock coats, and in fact, many consider it to be more faithful in spirit to Doyle's original intentions, yet there is something missing from this sequel , which follows Sherlock and the ever-faithful Dr. John Watson as they tackles one of their most famed nemeses, Dr. Moriarty, played with devilish charm by Jared Harris. Hijinks, naturally, ensue.Ritchie sets their adventures, which takes them from London to Paris, Germany and, ultimately, Switzerland, against a perpetually but appropriately grimy, dour backdrop that reeks of the industrialism of the mid-to-late 1800s. Though this tale takes place in an entirely different era from his usual works, it is still distinctly a Guy Ritchie movie, bloated with his regular stylizations and love of slow-motion. These flourishes sometimes work, as in segments that show Sherlock utilizing his almost superhuman powers of observation; other times, like in a massive action set piece in a forest, it feels like something lifted out of a Zack Snyder movie, which is not a compliment. Still, most of the action scenes strive for some level of originality, boosted significantly by a gleefully ominous and dissonant score from Hans Zimmer. However, beneath all the visual bravura, the movie feels oddly soulless, treating its characters like pieces in a game of chess. Despite a clever ending that features a couple of nice throwbacks to earlier moments in the film, the plot is cluttered, and it often seems as though the writers were making things up as they went along.The cast features several impressive names, but with the exception of Jared Harris, who, interestingly enough, is the least well-known of all the major performers, none of them are particularly engaging. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law reprise their roles as Sherlock and Watson, respectively. They have a pleasant, natural chemistry with each other, but the script never really allows their dynamic to progress beyond the exasperated but reluctantly loyal sidekick babysitting a mad, erratic genius. Downey Jr. has plenty of charisma, as he displayed so gloriously in his 'comeback' role as Tony Stark in Iron Man three years ago, but one wonders when he might explore roles that stretch his range and acting chops more, as Stark and Sherlock both feel like two sides of the same sarcastic narcissist coin. However, most disappointing is Noomi Rapace, who is wasted in the role of Madam Simza Heron, a gypsy who is supposed to help the main duo in their quest to foil Moriarty's dastardly plan and who possesses all the personality and depth of a plot device. Deservedly rocketing to fame after her excellent performance as Lisbeth Salander in the Swedish adaptation of Stieg Larsson's bestselling Millennium trilogy, she is much too talented to spend an entire movie (her first Hollywood blockbuster, no less) essentially standing around and taking orders while everyone else gets to actually partake in the action.One of the main attractions of Sherlock Holmes has always been his relationship with Watson, which is often depicted with some degree of a homoerotic subtext, and Guy Ritchie's version is no different. In fact, the movie seems to care so much about this relationship, to the detriment of all others, including the one between Watson and his wife, that at some point during the film, I began to abstractly wonder what it might be like if the film-makers just defied convention, took a risk and let them go beyond bromance and into romance, even a closeted one, given the time period. Roll your eyes and scoff if you will, but I would've accepted anything that might have livened up this humdrum affair.",6,3,5,24 December 2011
In Bruges," In Bruges is a must-see!!!
","Bruges is a fairytale. It's also in Belgium. We are repeatedly reminded of both these facts throughout the movie In Bruges, a dark comedy that isn't afraid to push the envelope on topics ranging from hit men and religion to midgets (no, dwarfs!), racism and tourist etiquette. This movie is not for the queasy or the easily offended as the violence is grisly and the jokes dance in the glory that is un-Politically Correctness.However, don't get me wrong, there is a lot that is easy to like about In Bruges. First, the scenery is gorgeous and the picturesque, quiet town serves as a delightful backdrop and foil to the story, which is at times pleasantly crude. After watching this movie, many feel a strong desire to visit Bruges and even I, a tourist more like Ray in taste than Ken, admit that there is a strange, almost magical appeal to the town. Indeed, often, it truly does feel like a fairytale place, especially when contrasted to the violence and pitch-black humor that fills much of the film.Secondly, the cast is absolutely flawless. As Ray, Colin Farrell brings an odd sort of charisma that immediately endears his character to the hearts of the viewers. Ray could easily have been overly rude and obnoxious, but instead, it is almost impossible not to like him and care about what happens to him. In this movie, Colin Farrell has perfect comedic timing and expressions that are, alternately, hilarious and touching and he proves that he can indeed act, something which many - including me - have known for a long time, and reminds the world why he reached A-list status at the ripe age of 25. As Ken, Ray's perfect foil, Brendan Gleeson brings a more subtle brilliance to the screen, lending his character a sort of quiet dignity that is rare in hit men, even those in the movies. In addition to their pitch-perfect performances, what really makes the friendship between Ray and Ken work is the undeniable chemistry between the actors. Also, it must be said that even though he appears in less than half of the movie, Ralph Fiennes gives a memorable performance and is, in turns, hilarious and menacing. The supporting cast is worth noting and, especially Jordan Prentice and Clemence Posey, does an excellent job of, well, supporting the main actors.The next most noteworthy aspect of In Bruges is the nearly flawless direction and writing by Martin McDonagh. This is McDonagh's first feature film (he is most known for his theater work and for winning the Oscar for the short film Six Shooter) and it is a better debut than almost anyone could ask for. There is barely a line of the dialogue that is unquotable and perhaps even more remarkable is the way McDonagh seamlessly blends all the elements of In Bruges. The action, comedy, romance and drama work together in perfect balance, giving the movie a unique and unforgettable feel. Also, while it is undeniably hilarious, it is the emotion that really makes In Bruges stand out, as well as the subtle message of redemption and friendship.",8,2,5,25 April 2009
Star Trek," A bold and immensely satisfying adventure
","When I walked into the theater, I barely knew anything about Star Trek. My knowledge consisted of a few character names and other tidbits I had picked up, mostly from reviews of this very movie. However, luckily for me, while there are probably some in-jokes and subtleties that I missed, it did not matter. My ignorance of Trekkie-lore did not hinder my enjoyment of an expertly-made and thoroughly entertaining movie. While I would not say that J.J. Abram's Star Trek is quite on par with The Dark Knight or even Batman Begins, which were both movies that successfully rebooted a failing franchise just like Star Trek, I agree with what many critics and audience members have been saying since the sci-fi movie first hit theaters: it is phenomenal for the way it managed to please fans of the original series while still welcoming newbies like me.One of the first things worth noting is the stellar ensemble cast. While no single performance stands out, though both Chris Pine as James T. Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Spock come rather close, every cast member gets a moment to shine and they all take advantage of that opportunity. Though they are relatively new to the movie industry, Pine and Quinto do a brilliant job as the two main characters and their relationship, which changes from one of mutual hate to something more amiable, develops extremely well, largely due to their unique chemistry. As the villain, Eric Bana brings just the right amount of menace and, strangely, humanity, allowing the audience to sympathize with his cause without compromising the evil nature of his character. Other performances that deserve mention are Karl Urban as Dr. 'Bones' McCoy, John Cho as Mr. Sulu, Simon Pegg as the quirky but intelligent Scotty and Anton Yelchin as a very Russian Chekov. Zoe Saldana does a fine job as Uhura but her character lacks the development and distinctive personality of the others as, though some comes through occasionally, she turns into little more than a love interest.Other than the fantastic cast, an infinite amount of credit for the movie's success should go to director J.J. Abrams. As a fan of Lost, I was ecstatic when I heard the praise reviewers were giving Abrams, and after seeing the movie, I completely concur with everything people have said about him. Given the amount of effort put into the film, it's surprising that he was, in fact, not originally a fan of Star Trek, yet that actually seems to be more of a good thing because he approached the movie as a newcomer, enabling him to tell the story without getting bogged down in the mythology as a die-hard fan might have done. Of course, he could only achieve all of this with the help of producer Damon Lindelof and writers Roborto Orzi and Alex Kurtzman, all of whom also worked with him on Lost. They all did a great job of developing the characters and combining action, romance, drama and science fiction into a credible, gripping story. The dialogue was clever, often funny, and occasionally cheesy, though that is not necessarily a bad thing. Also, there is enough emotion to make the audience - even non-Trekkies - care about the characters, many of whom are not even human, but it never becomes sappy or overly melodramatic.Last come the techs. The cinematography was very good and the visual effects, while nothing groundbreaking, were nonetheless quite spectacular. Fortunately, unlike many modern blockbusters, Star Trek does not fall into the trap of relying on special effects or action; in fact, the action is always secondary to the characters and story. The score by Michael Giacchino finds the right chord between heroically uplifting and urgent. It never distracts from the movie itself, instead emphasizing the tone or emotion of a particular scene and lending the film an almost epic feel.Initially, I was conflicted between seeing this or Terminator Salvation, which just came out, in theaters. A combination of impressively good reviews and word-of-mouth, the enticing trailer, a promising looking cast and, of course, J.J. Abrams convinced me to see Star Trek, and I in no way regret my choice. While I have not been converted to a hardcore Trekkie, nor do I think I ever will, I will certainly be interested in any sequels that come out in the future. May this franchise and the careers of all those involved live long and prosper.",8,4,13,25 May 2009
Iron Man 2," Iron Man 2 is a blast (sort of)
","When the first Iron Man hit the theaters, it surprised both critics and the general audience, eventually acquiring enough acclaim and, more importantly, box office revenue to turn this once-unknown comic book hero into a major franchise. The crisp, witty dialogue and smart casting transformed what could have been a generic origin story into something that felt original and fun. In this era of dark, brooding antiheroes, the wisecracking, irreverent Tony Stark was a breath of fresh air. For the sequel, Jon Favreau and co. have made something bigger, flashier but, unfortunately, not better. To their credit, it is clear that they paid enough attention when the original was released to know exactly what made it work, but almost everything that felt so effortless before became more forced and tired in the sequel.Iron Man 2's promotion has touted it, not wrongly, as the first major blockbuster of the season and as one of the most highly-anticipated movies of 2010. In hopes of living up to this hype, Favreau assembled an impressive ensemble cast that includes new additions Don Cheadle, a replacement for Terrence Howard after the latter had a much-publicized dispute with Marvel Studios; Mickey Rourke, who, like lead Robert Downey Jr., has been making a comeback in recent years; Scarlett Johannson; the generally under-appreciated Sam Rockwell; Samuel L. Jackson, whose character serves little purpose beyond setting up and shamelessly promoting the upcoming Avengers movie; and, of course, Favreau himself. While that is no doubt an eye-popping cast list, few of them really bring anything new to the film. Don Cheadle fails to bring his natural charisma to the fairly bland role of Rhodey, while Mickey Rourke sports an imposing Russian accent and body tattoos but is not given enough by the script to turn Ivan Vanko/Whiplash into the great villain he should have been. Likewise, Johannson is given little to do aside from being a sexy (naturally) blank slate, though she does shine in the one scene where she gets to show off the martial arts and hand-to-hand combat she learned for the role. In a performance reminiscent of Giovanni Ribisi as Parker Selfridge in last year's Avatar or of Gary Oldman in pretty much any of his villainous roles, Sam Rockwell is delightfully campy at times, but his character is irritatingly sleazy where he should have been suave and cunning. Like Vanko, Justin Hammer is woefully underdeveloped, becoming little more than your average, slimy but ultimately asinine and clueless baddie. In short, they all satisfy without wowing.As for the Iron Man veterans, there are really only two: Gwyneth Paltrow and, of course, Robert Downey Jr. I liked Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts in the first movie. She was professional without being a shrew, coy and charming but not flirtatious. In the sequel, however, Paltrow is, to but it bluntly, grating. It's not all her fault. Recently appointed CEO of Stark Industries, Pepper has become shrill and uptight, and she seems to spend the majority of her days chastising someone, usually Tony Stark, but also the press, Scarlett Johannson's Natascha and pretty much anyone that gets in her way even briefly. On the other hand, Robert Downey Jr. is almost as wonderful as he was when he first donned Iron Man's suit. I say 'almost' because fame has made Stark a slightly bigger jerk than he was before (i.e. a party scene that goes cringingly awry), and the self-professed 'textbook narcissism' and sarcasm are a little less charming; some of his quips feel less organic and off-the-cuff, and more as though screenwriter Justin Theroux felt pressured to just throw them in there. Still, Robert Downey Jr. brings so much magnetic charisma, energy and, at times, even vulnerability to the screen that we continue to root for Tony Stark after he exposes his most glaring flaws.In addition, something must be said about the Tony Stark-Pepper Potts romance. Before, Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow sizzled together, and, aside from undeniable chemistry, the main reason their romance was so alluring was that it was hardly a romance at all. It was a big mistake to have them kiss so soon, especially in a scene as hackneyed as this one, as, though the scene does not actually occur until the end, merely knowing about it beforehand, as I did, somehow makes their relationship lose much of its appeal.Don't get me wrong, though. Iron Man 2 has made some improvements from its predecessor, namely the action sequences. In the first one, Favreau's inexperience with the action/thriller genre was apparent, particularly in the lame showdown at the climax. In the sequel, the fight scenes are loud, over-the-top and riddled with clichés - from a scene where each bad guy conveniently approaches on his own to at least three instances of 'guy walks away while something explodes behind him' - but they are still more impressive than those in the original, perhaps thanks to an upgraded budget. There is just something so amusing and enjoyable about seeing cars flipping over whilst bursting into flames or seeing a giant, metal globe exploding. I particularly enjoyed both Scarlett Johannson's kicking-ass moment and the climatic battle where Stark and Rhodes confront dozens of drone robots controlled by Vanko while bickering about whose suit is better.The combination of fun action scenes, dazzling visuals, moments of inspired dialogue and some good acting almost, but does not quite, redeem the script, which has a rather thin, sometimes confusing plot further muddled by the inclusion of at least one too many subplots and poor development of the characters and relationships. But perhaps, I'm being overly critical. After all, Iron Man exists largely to entertain and, for the most part, it succeeds in that goal. If you're looking to kick back with friends while watching a breezy blockbuster, then Iron Man 2 is probably just the movie for you.",7,0,3,9 May 2010
The Hunger Games," Jennifer Lawrence, Gary Ross and the audience emerge from The Hunger Games victorious
","In recent years, the young adult sphere of pop culture has been dominated by a certain boy wizard and, more irritatingly for those of us who aren't tween girls or their middle-aged mothers, vampires and werewolves named Edward and Jacob. Now, at last, another is breaking into their ranks, a sixteen year old girl with a braid, a bow and enough spirited determination to conquer the world: meet Katniss Everdeen, the girl on fire.As Harry Potter's legacy officially ends with the eighth and final movie of the franchise having bowed last year, cementing J.K. Rowling's landmark series as the cornerstone of the childhood of a generation, and the world eagerly anticipates – or dreads – the release of the last Twilight movie, Gary Ross offers us his fine cinematic adaptation of The Hunger Games, the first chapter in Suzanne Collins' bestselling trilogy about a dystopian future where teens are forced to fight to the death by a government that controls its citizens with an iron fist. The director of Seabiscuit brings Collins' story to life with a serious-minded verve and intelligence that distinguishes it from other young adult-oriented fare, assembling an almost pitch-perfect cast and treating the source material – and its fans – with a respect that feels increasingly rare in an industry that often seems to value easy money and marketability over true quality, especially when it comes to potential franchises.The temptation to churn out a cheap, lazy cash-grab a la the Twilight movies must've been there, given that audiences would've flocked to the theaters regardless, but the filmmakers evidently cared about the movie beyond its obvious box-office potential. They take the pulse-pounding intensity of the books and successfully translate it to the big screen, staying true in spirit but displaying a great willingness to tweak and embellish the story when necessary. Among other changes, by expanding the point of view beyond Katniss, the movie offers a wider perspective, something new that could not be found in the book. It feels like a genuine, standalone movie rather than a paint-by-the-numbers adaptation, a distinction that the Harry Potter movies, for all their artistic merits, never quite mastered. Aside from some memorable performances, those films never provided anything that the books didn't. Furthermore, though as someone who has read the books, I could be wrong about this, The Hunger Games does a good enough job of establishing its characters, story and tone internally that it should work for those coming in cold as well as long-time fans.Instead of going for sweeping and epic, Ross smartly focuses on the intimate, human aspects of the story, using a sometimes shaky camera and concise editing to create an almost documentary-like feel. He pays as much attention to the quiet scenes, such as a moment near the very beginning where Katniss comforts and sings to her younger sister Prim before leaving to hunt, as he does to the action scenes, which are sporadic and avoid self-indulgence, neither glorifying nor glossing over the violence. The music, composed by T. Bone Burnett, eschews the bombastic punk rock one might have expected in favor of a sparse, folksy vibe that reflects both the rustic simplicity of Katniss's District 12 roots and her inner desperation as she fights for survival; a few techno beats are thrown in as well whenever the action moves to the more advanced, futuristic Capitol. The costumes and sets also help realize the world of Panem in vivid detail while toning down the more outrageous elements of Collins's descriptions, particularly when it comes to the over-the-top fashion tastes of the Capitol residents.At the center of it all is Katniss Everdeen, played by a forceful but artfully restrained and nuanced Jennifer Lawrence, who appears in nearly every scene and, coupled with her Oscar-nominated performance as the similarly strong-willed and independent Ree in Winter's Bone, is establishing herself as a consistently compelling actress and a screen presence to be reckoned with. Passionate, complex and quick-witted, Katniss is willing to do whatever it takes to protect the people she loves, even if it involves violence or means putting herself in danger, but she doesn't descend into the emotionless, sexless (or sexed-up) killing machine cliché that seems to pass for a strong female character in action films nowadays. She's a heroine worth rooting for.Though Jennifer Lawrence is undoubtedly the star of the movie, she's joined by a host of talented, well-chosen supporting actors. As Peeta Mellark, Katniss's fellow District 12 tribute and sort-of love interest, Josh Hutcherson displays the appropriate amounts of charisma, sensitivity and conviction; he's come a long way since he first appeared in movies like the mostly forgettable Will Ferrell vehicle Kicking and Screaming and Zathura and continues to prove himself to be one of the most promising actors of his generation. Elizabeth Banks is almost unrecognizable under heavy, purposefully crude makeup as the shrill, peppy Effie, and Woody Harrelson and Stanley Tucci are both as magnetic as always as, respectively, Katniss's and Peeta's perpetually drunk mentor Haymitch and Caesar Flickerman, host of the Hunger Games telecast.Movies geared toward young adults or teens tend to be dismissed as escapist, mindless fluff not worthy of more serious consideration. Though it's hard to tell whether The Hunger Games will break this mold and be embraced as fully as the Harry Potter series, which found admirers among the young and old, critics and general audiences, was, it has an edge and intelligence that make it hard to resist. Sure, there are more pointed, hard-hitting social critiques out there, and it isn't as bleak or gritty as some might have liked, but as engaging entertainment that doesn't just ask viewers to turn their brains off, it more than delivers.",8,2,11,25 March 2012
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Crazy, Stupid, Love is a real crowd-pleaser
","It was roughly two-thirds of the way into Crazy, Stupid, Love when I realized how invested the audience in my theater had become. The key scene involved a mom cleaning her daughter's room, a seemingly mundane moment that produced gasps and cries of 'Oh no!' even before the character makes a very revealing discovery. It's a scene that, much like the rest of Crazy, Stupid, Love, a heartwarming and, at times, painfully honest depiction of three couples at various stages in each of their relationships, unfolds not with predictability so much as inevitability. Unlike your average, generic romantic-comedy, this movie focuses less on the end, on who will end up with whom, than on the special and often surprising connections that are made along the way. What's more, it achieves the remarkable and all-too-rare feat of actually moving the audience to care about the central characters, to cheer when they come out on top and sympathize when they don't.Using a witty, compassionate and ever-so-slightly subversive script from Dan Fogelman, directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, who are best known for writing the pitch-black comedy/satire Bad Santa and only have one other directorial effort under their belts (last year's I Love You, Philip Morris), guide the production along with subtle ease. They strike an ideal balance between humor and drama, allowing the overall tone to develop organically. Laughs come mostly in chuckles at the cleverness of a line or its delivery and are never awkwardly forced in to lighten up a scene, while the emotions feel genuine without becoming manipulative. Most of all, their restrained approach allows the actors to breathe and to fully embody the characters they've been given.Speaking of which, has there ever been a more likable group of people assembled for a film, much less a romantic comedy? The cast gels remarkably well, and at no point is anyone singled out as a villain; even when a character threatens to become unlikable, the actor portrays him or her with such keen understanding that it ultimately becomes hard, if not impossible, to not root for each and every one of them. Whenever the film tiptoes the line toward schmaltzy, they pull it back, making every line and emotion feel utterly real. As the unquestionable lead of the film, Steve Carell displays a tenderness and dramatic depth he'd only hinted at in previous works like the unexpectedly moving The 40-Year-Old Virgin and occasional episodes of The Office, while Ryan Gosling, all immaculate grooming, sly grins and twinkling eyes, is perfectly cast as his foil, Jacob, a suave ladies' man who's really using all that money and swagger to disguise the emptiness he feels inside. Julianne Moore and Emma Stone are both lovely as Emily and Hannah, respectively, radiating a down-to-earth presence and relatability that many other Hollywood actresses seem to lack. Also worth noting are Analeigh Tipton and Jonah Bobo, who form Crazy, Stupid, Love's youngest romantic pairing and have been all but ignored by the movie's publicity campaigns despite their obvious talents.What truly sets Crazy, Stupid, Love apart from other modern-day romantic comedies, aside from the perceptive writing and direction and a dream cast, is that it strives to be meaningful, rather than just mindless, predictable fluff. Though the movie employs its share of clichés (precocious kid, guy falls for the one girl who initially rejected his advances, etc.) , it's often done with a knowing wink, most obviously when, after an altercation with Emily, his ex, and rain begins to pour down on him, Carell's despondent Cal mutters, 'What a cliché.' It shows that love is messy, irrational, sweet and universal, filled with regrets and tears as well as hope and joy. It celebrates movies like Say Anything or Jerry Maguire where sentimental wasn't a bad word and love meant more than sex, diamond earrings and expensive, candlelit dinners, where those small, precious moments of quiet intimacy – a shared look, a simple but honest conversation, a laugh, a smile, buying a mint chocolate chip ice cream cone, a spontaneous phone call – speak as loudly as the grandest, most dramatic, craziest gestures.In short, Crazy, Stupid, Love does what the best romantic comedies do: it gives us a glimpse into the raw, human moments that collectively build to bring two people together – or, at times, tear them apart; we fall in love with them just as they fall in – or, out of – love with each other. It's the perfect date movie, and so much more. To all the other ones, the mediocre, cornball, lazy, offensive rom-coms and chick-flicks out there, Ryan Gosling has a message for you: be better than The Gap. Be better than The Gap.",9,135,179,4 August 2011
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," The epitome of a guilty pleasure
","I walked into Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time with virtually no expectations, yet at the end, I felt simultaneously relieved that I had seen the movie for free and not particularly guilty that I had seen it at all. With good reason by all accounts, films adapted from computer games have gained an almost malicious reputation over the years, and many film lovers lament the increasing number of such movies. Prince of Persia is most likely among the best computer game adaptations ever made, mindless and sometimes outright incoherent yet a perfectly enjoyable way to spend two hours, alternating between cringe-worthy and snappy dialogue and boasting a solid cast led by Jake Gyllenhaal and Gemma Arterton.Strangely enough, for a big-spectacle summer blockbuster, the most gaping flaw of Prince of Persia is the action. The stunts are incredible at times, but thanks to sloppy cinematography and CGI that is often all too obvious, the numerous action scenes are far from the compelling setpieces expected from epics of this nature. Probably in an homage to the video game from which the movie is based, director Mike Newell frequently takes advantage of slow-mo and Bourne-like fast cuts, yet these stylized techniques do nothing to enhance the action, instead reducing it to an almost headache-inducing mess.Naturally, the story, a convoluted plot involving royal factions, a murder and a sacred dagger that allows the user to go back a minute in time, is far-fetched to the point of hilarity. Despite the high costs, the audience never invests much in the story's outcome and real emotion is pretty much nonexistent. In the hands of, say, Ridley Scott, the movie could have been a complete failure. However, it is clear that the film-makers do not take the material seriously, and they are fully aware that however entertaining Prince of Persia is, the mere concept that forms its foundation cannot allow for a serious outing. Instead, because they ostensibly had fun making the movie, the audience has fun watching it.The cast also helps transcend the material. Jake Gyllenhaal, incredibly buff yet still boyish and sincere, steps outside his comfort zone, his career thus far consisting mostly of quiet dramas like 1999's October Sky and 2005's Brokeback Mountain. Notwithstanding a bizarre, not altogether successful British accent, he glides through the film with vigor and enthusiasm, making for a likable hero. Gemma Arterton, on the other hand, while not terrible, is shrill, aggravating and insufferable. Even toward the movie's conclusion, her character stays trapped in the obnoxious stereotype so often depicted in romantic comedies and action movies, one that is increasingly on the rise with the recent trend of rom-com-action films along the lines of Killers and Knight and Day. In fact, when stripped to its bare bones, Prince of Persia could easily be considered a romantic comedy (albeit with little of the romance): the hero and heroine meet; they initially treat each other with contempt and disgust; they slowly fall in love despite their wildly differing personalities and various external obstacles; they manage to overcome the force separating them and eventually, through a mix of hard work and, perhaps to a greater extent, coincidence, they wind up in each others arms for a classic happily ever after. Their relationship works for the most part, not because Gyllenhaal and Arterton have particularly great - or even good - chemistry but because their banter, both fun and unbelievably cheesy, is among the movie's most enjoyable parts. Of the supporting cast, Alfred Molina is by far the standout, arguably stealing the movie from its two leads. As the greedy, bumbling owner of an ostrich racing ring and an ardent hater of capitalism, he bites into his part with relish, saving his character from becoming a completely infuriating waste of words and screen time.In the end, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time manages to surmount the rules of logic and good film-making to become a diverting, campy, wild ride.",5,0,1,17 July 2010
"I Love You, Man"," You can't help but fall for 'I Love You, Man'
","In a time filled with dark and cynical comedies, 'I Love You, Man' is a pleasant and satisfying breath of fresh air. It is one of those few romantic comedies nowadays with an equal balance of humor and sweetness. The sincerity of the actors and dialogue, which is witty, sometimes hilarious but never over-the-top or cheesy, gives this movie an undeniable appeal that is absent from so many of the comedies churned out by Hollywood.Part of that appeal comes from the lead actor. Of course, I'm talking about the always lovable Paul Rudd. He makes the audience really cheer for his character and turns what could have been a one-dimensional stereotype into someone that feels genuine and real. With excellent comic timing, he gives Peter Claven a sort of almost puppy-dog innocence and an every-guy feel. Despite his obvious social awkwardness, he is the guy that you'd want to have a beer with or just hang out with after work. Paul Rudd delivers his lines so well, with such naturalness, that I wondered how much of it was actually scripted and how much had been improvised or reflected his real personality.It also helps that he has great chemistry with Jason Segal and Rashida Jones. As a carefree yet somewhat lazy investor, Jason Segal makes his character fun to watch and it's no surprise that he and Paul Rudd really do seem like the perfect friends. Paul Rudd's chemistry with Rashida Jones helps make the few lines that could have sounded sappy or cheesy seem totally natural. Unlike in many rom-coms, you actually want their relationship to work out. This is also the result of the script, which fleshed out Zooey (Rashida Jones's character) as much as it fleshed out any of the male characters. She does not feel at all clichéd.I must also mention the rest of the terrific supporting cast, which includes J.K. Simmons, Andy Samberg, Jon Favreau and Jamie Pressly, among others. Though none of them got nearly as much screen time as the three main actors, they all had their moments and did a great job with their characters, which were quirky but believable.Like any good comedy, I Love You, Man had a script that had both laughs and heart. Though it was not 'rolling-in-the-aisle' funny, there were definitely plenty of laugh-out loud moments to keep the audience's attention. But what is perhaps even more special, the story is genuinely touching. The relationships between the characters are well-developed, especially the friendship between Peter and Sydney. The message about being honest and being yourself is well-delivered and never comes off as preachy. At the end, it leaves you feeling warm and optimistic, like any good comedy should.",8,3,6,29 March 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Despite some good moments, this superhero movie isn't so super
","I didn't expect much walking into the theater. In fact, until recently, I had no intention of seeing this movie unless it happens to be on TV. But, as things turned out, it was either this or Ghosts of Girlfriends Past or rewatching Terminator Salvation. I chose this.And I must admit that it isn't as bad as I expected it to be. It had its share of praiseworthy moments, and even a few mild chuckles. The actors were decent for what they were given and many of the parts of the movie that worked were largely due to the charisma of the cast, especially Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds. Though he was adequate in the first three movies, I felt like this was the first movie where Hugh Jackman really became Wolverine, perhaps because the film focuses entirely on his character, whereas in the previous movies, there had been only limited attention given to the character of Wolverine, even though he is probably one of the most essential characters in the franchise. If it weren't for Hugh Jackman, Wolverine would almost certainly feel like a one-dimensional character. If given a better script, he might have really made Wolverine a noteworthy character. There has been talk of another X-Men movie focusing on Ryan Reynolds's character, Wade/Deadpool, and it's not hard to see why. Although he's absent for the majority of the movie, in the few scenes he gets, Reynolds brings an energy to the screen that immediately attracts the audience to his character. In addition, while not quite as impressive as either of the aforementioned actors, Liev Schreiber is well-cast in the role of Victor Creed, Wolverine's brother. He exudes the right amount of menace without making his character a completely one-dimensional villain.Of course, the special effects are pretty good, though sometimes it's a bit too heavy on the CGI. Many of the battle sequences are over-the-top and too long and a scene at the beginning showing the U.S. invasion of Normandy beach during WWII can't compare to the opening of Saving Private Ryan, though it's doubtful that the film-makers intended to surpass that classic scene.I think the biggest flaws of Wolverine are 1) the fact that it felt like two-and-a-half hours, though in fact, the movie is only two hours long; 2) the script, which, while slightly better than the script for the previous X-Men movies, is unremarkable and often rather preposterous, particularly during the climatic battle, when it constantly resorted to contrivances; and 3) the fact that there are so many characters that we don't care much about any of them, though this is less of a problem than in the previous X-Men, where there were so many characters that it was hard to keep track of them all. Also, as in the other films, there was a weak performance or two and at least one unnecessary character. In the other movies, the weakest performance belonged to Halle Berry, who always felt immensely miscast and almost robotic as Storm, and there were too many unnecessary characters to count. In Wolverine, it's a contest between Lynn Collins as Silver Fox, Wolverine's obligatory love interest, and Taylor Kitsch as Gambit, though his poor performance could also be partly contributed to the fact that his character was pointless even for X-Men.All in all, while it isn't a waste of money and time, thanks in large part to excellent performances from many in the cast particularly Jackman and Reynolds, Wolverine has numerous glaring flaws. Unless you are a fan of the X-Men comics or movies, wait until better movies come your way.",6,0,2,10 July 2009
Terminator Salvation," Terminator Salvation was entertaining but fails to carry on the story behind the action
","It's been twenty-five years since Arnold Schwarzenegger first donned a leather jacket and spoke the iconic words 'I'll be back.' And he certainly was. A lot can happen in twenty-five years. Sequels to the groundbreaking The Terminator sprang up, some good (T2) and some disappointing (T3), and then came the TV show. Somewhere in between Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines is Terminator Salvation. While it transcends the latter by miles, the fourth installment in the Terminator franchise does not come near to touching the original or, subsequently, T2, which I think has been the best Terminator film of, well, probably ever.Terminator Salvation depicts the war of the machines and the struggle of the human survivors of Judgment Day. Roughly three interconnected story lines spring up over the course of the movie: John Connor (Christian Bale) as he helps the resistance against SkyNet; Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a convicted criminal who was executed in 2003 only to wake up in post-Judgment Day 2018; and Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), who is currently a teenager but, of course, later becomes father to John Connor. Though one would think that John Connor would dominate the film as the possible savior of humanity, the most compelling of the three stories is, in fact, that of Marcus Wright. While he does not upstage Christian Bale as many critics say, Sam Worthington provides the emotional heart of the film, however small that heart might be, and displays all the signs of a future star. His performance here is a solid basis for the endless hype and praise he has received from James Cameron, who so-called 'discovered' Worthington and will direct him in the upcoming and much-anticipated Avatar. The rest of the cast is solid. No one particularly stands out but they all are satisfactory in their roles.When people heard that McG, whose most renowned work thus far is the Charlie's Angels films, the general reaction was negative. I was inclined to give McG a chance, even though it was difficult to imagine anyone besides James Cameron successfully directing a Terminator movie, particularly after the third one (the first one not directed by Cameron) failed miserably. In the end, while T4 was quite a bit better than T3, I have to admit that perhaps my doubts were correct. The editing was mediocre, especially when compared to the other special effects that occupied the film. Also, while there was definitely enough substance to support a full-length movie, the story was made secondary to the action. The film-makers began to develop some of the characters, yet by the end, the majority of them ended up being rather flat. None of them were given clear backstories (except for, of course, John Connor, who was in two of the previous films) or definite motivations. Marcus was the most intriguing and I was hoping that they would provide more information on his background, about his life prior to being sent to jail, but I was disappointed. Fortunately, though the tone of the movie is decidedly grim, the occasional references to iconic aspects of previous films - T3 not included - might elicit smiles from fans of the original and its sequel.Predictably, though, the most impressive aspect of the film is the ear-busting but dazzling action and visual effects. I say 'visual' because, while there is a lot of CGI and computer wizardry involved, many of the most eye-popping explosions were actual explosions; for one particularly spectacular blow-up scene, McG and the crew detonated a real gas station. The trailer for Terminator Salvation promises a blood-pumping, action-filled summer blockbuster, nothing more, nothing less, and the movie delivers, in that aspect at any rate. The gritty, dark atmosphere and cinematography made the landscape truly feel as though Earth has endured an apocalyptic disaster, heightening the sense of gravity and immersing the audience in this bleak world.In the end, that's all it comes down to. For those expecting an original, dramatic story with a well-developed plot and characters, perhaps this is not the best place to look. However, anyone hoping for an entertaining, visually appealing spectacle, then Terminator Salvation is just the thing for you.",6,3,6,30 May 2009
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Tinker, Tailor spins tangled web of intrigue, betrayal and frosty brilliance
","In a way, Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is one of those movies that's easier to admire than to love. From a technical standpoint, it's pitch-perfect with a top-notch cast of actors who effortlessly burrow into their parts without any of the usual 'look at me!' theatrics, sets and costumes that meticulously recreate Cold War Europe and subtly elegant cinematography, all blended together with precision by a promising, up-and-coming director. Yet, it's not the type of film that will inspire feelings of warmth or ecstasy from many moviegoers, more likely to leave them wandering out of the theater deep in thought than giddy or excited. In most movies, the stern aloofness that pervades Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy would be a drawback, preventing the audience from connecting with or caring about the characters, but in this case, it works, effectively creating an atmosphere of suspicion and distrust where the viewer is as wary of the characters as they are of each other.Based on the well-respected novel of the same name by former spy John le Carre, Tomas Alfredson's adapation manages to strip down le Carre's book to its bare bones – every scene, line of dialogue and gesture feels absolutely essential to furthering either plot or character, often both – without sacrificing its complexity or nuance. The story is elaborate, though its basic premise can be boiled down to 'there's a mole at the Circus', code for British intelligence agency MI6, and as condescending as it sounds, it requires the audience to not only pay attention, but to think. At the center of it all is the famed George Smiley, played by Gary Oldman in what is probably the most low-key performance of his career, a stark contrast from the deliciously over-the-top grandiosity he has developed a reputation for over the past three decades. With his large, plastic-framed glasses, nondescript suits and soft-spoken manner, Smiley is reminiscent of an owl: outwardly, he's passive and remarkably still, virtually blending into the background, but there's also an aura of wisdom, the kind that comes with age and world experience, surrounding him; you can sense that he's constantly thinking, observing. Oldman conveys all this perfectly, easily inhabiting a role that should, but likely won't, earn him a long-awaited Oscar nomination. He's accompanied by a stellar supporting cast of some of the best British actors working today, including veterans John Hurt and Colin Firth, rising stars Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hardy, the always reliable character actor Toby Jones and Mark Strong, whose role here is the best he's gotten since first appearing on most people's radars in Ridley Scott's decent but otherwise unremarkable Body of Lies.The movie as a whole is a lot like the character of Smiley. On the surface, it's positively serene, but underneath, there's so much going on that it can be hard to keep track of it all as tension quietly builds toward the gripping climax, which features not a shootout or frenetic car chase, but a waiting game. It's a labyrinthine mind puzzle as tightly constructed and methodical as the clocks ticking in the background of several scenes. Making his English-language debut after receiving much acclaim for the vampire coming-of-age movie Let the Right One In, Swedish filmmaker Tomas Alfredson proves himself to be a master of silence, of revealing everything using virtually nothing. Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is the definition of a slow-burner, but for those willing to be patient and attentive, it offers ample rewards.",8,1,2,8 January 2012
The Way Back," An uncompromising story of survival and the search for freedom and home
","The Way Back is a bit of a puzzler. It's directed by Peter Weir, whose last picture, 2003's Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, was a surprise commercial hit and racked up 10 Oscar nominations, including two wins, and the cast, while not blinding with star-wattage, isn't exactly completely unknown. Based on - or, rather, inspired by - a popular, though later debunked, memoir, this movie had all the makings of a prestige picture ripe for awards and critical praise. However, aside from a brief rumor of an earlier-than-expected release all the way back at the end of 2009, The Way Back has rarely been talked about, receiving a muted screening at the 2010 Telluride Film Festival and a barely-there, Oscar-qualifying run in mid-December before entering theaters nationwide with little of the fanfare one might have anticipated.At the same time, though, once you have seen the actual film, the reluctance of major studios or distributors to back it is surprisingly understandable. The Way Back isn't what you would call audience-friendly. There are subtitles (in fact, the entire opening scene is in Russian) and characters with hard-to-pronounce-or-remember names, and the plot is at a bare minimum; long stretches of the film consist of little more than people walking and scourging for food or water. It's a World War II movie, but instead of battling soldiers or the Holocaust, it focuses on those oft-overlooked victims of the war: the prisoners in Soviet gulags, which ultimately claimed the lives of more than one and a half million people.Weir approaches this material the way a documentary or news article views its subject. Using stark, unstylized cinematography to capture the brutality and harsh beauty of the landscapes involved and a stripped-down score by Burkhard von Dallwitz, he's unsparing, almost methodical, yet there's something strangely impersonal about the whole affair. In the hands of another director, Steven Spielberg for example, The Way Back would probably have been a grand, tear-jerking opera about survival against the odds and humanity's struggle to find freedom, the sort of epic spectacle the movie-going public loves. That's not to say Peter Weir doesn't address these themes; he simply does so without much showboating. Instead, he opts for realism over overt emotional catharsis, and as a result, we sympathize more with the characters' situation than with the people themselves. When someone dies, and that happens quite a few times, we process it as an unfortunate yet inevitable occurrence, rather than a genuinely heartbreaking tragedy. We learn names, professions, backgrounds, but the characters, even Janusz, our chief protagonist, remain stubbornly enigmatic.That said, there's little, if anything, technically wrong with this movie. The cast is the definition of a good ensemble: all involved give strong performances, no individual rising - or seeking to rise - above the others. Keith R. Clarke's script is well-paced and surprisingly engaging considering the rather repetitive nature of the story. If anything, I would have liked it to be longer as the film-makers completely skipped over the final leg of Janusz's journey, the daunting trek over the Himalayas into India, a move that feels prompted out of fear of scaring audiences away with a lengthier running-time (the film as it is already clocks in at 132 minutes). Peter Weir's direction is admirable. Like he did with Master and Commander, he injects life into material that might have otherwise been stilted and un-cinematic.The Way Back isn't the easiest movie to stomach. Weir refuses to gloss over or sugarcoat the realities of either life in a gulag or the adversities the prisoners must face once they escape; this is a world where kindness is a weakness that can be deadly to those who exhibit it, and in one scene, two characters discuss which one of their companions they should eat first, if necessary. The make-up department deserves some kudos for their efforts to make these normally attractive actors convincing as rugged, beleaguered travelers struggling to make it through each day.Yet, there is one question that lingers at the heart of this film: Is it worth it? Not only does Janusz endure 4,000 miles of what looks like hell on Earth, but when he finally comes out alive, he's unable to return home, exiled by an oppressive government for crimes he didn't commit. Rather than simply ending with the characters' victorious arrival in India, Peter Weir puts their tale into perspective by using black-and-white newsreel footage to trace events from the end of World War II, through the Cold War and, finally, with the demise of communism and the Soviet Union. These historic clips are accompanied by the shadow of two feet continuously moving forward, one in front of the other, and as the montage fades to show Janusz reuniting with his home and beloved, long-suffering wife forty years after his journey across a continent, we realize the answer: yes.",8,8,14,23 January 2011
The Town," A 'Town' to be proud of
","There's a line in The Town where Doug (Ben Affleck) describes his younger self as 'a twenty-two year old kid who thought he had it all figured out...before he threw it all away.' The same could be said of the old Ben Affleck, the one who took the movie industry by storm when he, along with best pal Matt Damon, won the Best Original Screenplay Oscar for 1997's Good Will Hunting. What followed was the stuff of Hollywood cautionary tales: while Matt Damon steadily gained popularity and respect, Affleck's accomplishments (namely a stellar turn in 2002's oft-overlooked Changing Lanes) were drowned out by his role in critical, if not box-office, duds like Pearl Harbor and Gigli, and by his much-publicized romance with two-time costar Jennifer Lopez. He was a punchline, a sellout. But this is a new Ben Affleck. After a praised performance in Hollywoodland and recapturing the industry's attention with his promising directorial debut Gone Baby Gone, he's carefully working his way to becoming the latest comeback kid.It's immediately clear why he chose The Town as the next phase in that process. Like Good Will Hunting, it's essentially a love letter to Boston, the city that has provided the location of most of Affleck's best works. He delights in panoramic views of the downtown area and harbor, and a statement during the credits tells audience members that the movie is, in fact, dedicated to the good, normal, hard-working people of Charlestown, the neighborhood where most of the action takes place. However, it's also clear that he didn't just choose the location for personal kicks. He knows Boston the way Woody Allen and Martin Scorsese know New York or the way Michael Mann knows Los Angeles, and this unique awareness comes through in every scene, every shot. What is most impressive about Affleck's direction and the movie as a whole is how he grounds it in authenticity and manages to instantly and effortlessly drag viewers into this world. He doesn't romanticize or glorify; he lets the city – sometimes literally – speak for itself.This realism extends to the people as well. Ben Affleck's script, co-written by Peter Craig and Aaron Stockard and based on Chuck Hogan's novel Prince of Thieves, is populated by rich, sharply-drawn characters that feel honest and genuine, a welcome relief from the cardboard stereotypes that often appear in this type of film. Of course, it helps to have a talented, all-star cast to bring the characters to life. As Doug, Ben Affleck delivers one of the best performances of his career, though that probably seems more about the quality of his past work than what he does in The Town; trust me, though, he's really quite good.Still, it's the supporting cast that deserves much of the kudos in the acting department. First and foremost in line is Jeremy Renner, fresh off his star-making turn in last year's phenomenal The Hurt Locker, who here gives us a searing, live-wire of a performance as James Coughlin, Doug's childhood friend and chief partner-in-crime. Jim is a virtual ticking time-bomb, the kind of guy who acts without thinking and sets even his fellow criminals on edge, but like in The Hurt Locker, Renner avoids easy caricature, instead injecting his character with unexpected complexity and pathos. Rebecca Hall is striking as a bank manager/local do-gooder, and with help from the script, she turns Claire into more than just 'the girlfriend'; nothing about the performance feels artificial or forced. However, the most surprising performance comes from Blake Lively, who, at this point, is best known as Gossip Girl's Serena. She appears in only a handful of scenes, and at first glance, Krista Coughlin, sister of James and Doug's long-time girlfriend, appears to be nothing more than another prostitute with a heart of gold. As the movie progresses, however, Krista evolves from a stock character into a real person; she might not have a heart of gold, but she does have the feelings and nuances of someone you might run into while walking down the street, someone willing to do anything just to get through each day. Lively's final scene is raw and emotional, arguably the most poignant one in the film.Make no mistake, though. The Town may be largely character-driven, but it's far from a quiet, intimate drama. The script's nearly pitch-black humor is reminiscent of Scorsese's The Departed, and the violence comes fast and unrestrained. Affleck directs the action sequences with proficiency, adding some well-placed stylistic flourishes but largely opting for a straightforward approach that creates tension while still allowing the viewer to easily keep track of what's going on. The highlight, a prolonged Fenway Park heist/shootout, is on par with Michael Mann's classic scene from Heat.The Town is not without its flaws – Jon Hamm's FBI agent is rather underwritten, giving the actor little room to make much of an impression, and though the ending is probably the right one, it feels a bit too optimistic in tone for a movie essentially about the bleak trappings of working-class life – but for the most part, its strengths make those blemishes easy to forgive. This is a taut, gripping thriller about people who defy the law not because they think it's glamorous, but because they see no other way out. Watch out, world, because this new Ben Affleck? He's here to stay.",8,8,16,20 September 2010
Shutter Island," Scorsese and DiCaprio keep their streak alive with 'Shutter Island'
","Shutter Island is finally here. The latest film to pair director Martin Scorsese and actor Leonardo DiCaprio opens in February, roughly five months later than the original October 2009 date. However, all concerns about the movie's quality (Paramount has said the move was made for financial reasons, anyway) can now be officially cast aside. The wait was well-worth it.The source material is a (fantastic) novel by Dennis Lehane, who has already had two of his other books adapted for the screen and is no stranger to this process. As a huge fan of Lehane's work, I have largely been disappointed by the adaptations; Clint Eastwood's direction rendered the powerful and emotional drama Mystic River cold and distant, while Gone Baby Gone, though a definite improvement over the former movie, felt a little too bogged down in the seriousness of the story and moral dilemmas, losing much of the charm and humor of the book along the way. Fortunately, with the arrival of Shutter Island, I can now say that we have a Lehane adaptation done right. At this rate of improvement, the next one ought to be a full-blown masterpiece.Then again, perhaps it shouldn't be a surprise that Scorsese would be the one to finally get it right. Both he and Lehane have a penchant for urban crime dramas, getting down-and-dirty in the grittiness of city life while maintaining a level of dark humor to offset the occasionally nauseating realism. Shutter Island represents a departure for both of them. It is the only time so far that Dennis Lehane has come close to writing horror, while Scorsese has only attempted the genre once before, with the 1991 Cape Fear. Inexperience matters not, as, though it is certainly different from the rest of their work, Shutter Island is the product of people who truly know their craft. Though Scorsese emphasizes the horror/creepy elements of the plot more, they seem to mostly be on the same page, down to, according to interviews, the works that influenced them and their sources for inspiration - namely, the horror and noir genres of the '50s through the '70s.Indeed, Shutter Island is set in the 1950s and is more like an old-fashioned psychological thriller than the slasher-horror movies of late. The strings-heavy score, though initially a tad bit overdone, brings to mind Stanley Kubrick's The Shining at times and, combined with the cinematography, art direction and Scorsese's trademark single-camera technique, produces both an intense atmosphere of suspense and the aura of a Hitchcock film or the 1960's classic The Manchurian Candidate.For his latest venture, Martin Scorsese brings together one of the most eye-popping ensemble casts in any movie since, well, The Departed. As with that movie, the actors - including Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Williams, Max von Sydow, Emily Mortimer, Jackie Earle Haley and, of course, the aforementioned Leo DiCaprio - prove here that they've got talent to go along with their names, which are certainly well-known in the more avid film-lovers community, if not the general public. Despite their relatively limited screen time (Mortimer and Haley only have one scene each), the major players in the supporting cast all get a moment to shine and they take full advantage of it, each of them delving into his role with vigor and creating complex, three-dimensional beings, not just the flat characters that populate most thrillers.But, in terms of acting, the movie unarguably belongs to Leonardo DiCaprio. Perfectly cast, he brings U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels to life, capturing every contradiction and nuance of character depicted in the book while adding his own natural mannerisms and depth; he combines the two with the ease of a pro. There are only a few actors working today that can be fully convincing when asked to cry one minute and kill a person the next, when they must simultaneously exude vulnerability and aggression; DiCaprio is one of those few. His intensity and deftness in performances like this make you wonder why he does not yet have an Oscar.However, aside from the technical expertise on display, perhaps what most elevates Shutter Island above your generic suspense thriller is the intelligence and depth of the story. Set in a time when the country was still recovering from the atrocities of World War II and the Nazis while fear of Communism was blossoming into full-on paranoia, it raises questions about the ethics and morals of the time period. Shutter Island explores the very nature of sanity and violence, reminding us how volatile the human mind really is; one wrong push and anyone could cross the thin line that separates reason from madness. How should we treat those that do cross that line? Though the field of psychology has come far since the Cold War, that is a question that still plagues us. Should we treat them as patients, with compassion and hope that they can be cured, or as prisoners, as dangerous threats that should be guarded and isolated from society? Still, at its core, Shutter Island is an entertaining and, at times, chilling thriller. The film-makers never forget that, sustaining a tone of suspense throughout the movie and never allowing philosophical musings to overwhelm the plot or characters.Over the past decade, Scorsese and DiCaprio have proved to be among the most reliable director-actor pairings working in Hollywood today. Even their weakest effort, Gangs of New York, was a solid and fun, if uneven, project. All three of their collaborations thus far have earned multiple Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. It remains to be seen whether they will continue this run with Shutter Island, which is probably the most commercial and least awards-friendly movie of the four, but they should be proud of the work they've done here, regardless of what happens come awards season. Shutter Island is a high-quality film that works as pure entertainment and as something a little deeper. Guys, you've have done it again.",8,2,6,21 February 2010
Captain America: The First Avenger," Captain America: First Avenger fights superhero fatigue - and wins
","In many ways, Captain America: The First Avenger resembles its title character, that iconic symbol of good, ol'-fashioned, American patriotism. Like the Cap, this movie has been embellished with all the bells-and-whistles of modern-day technology, supported by state-of-the-art special effects and blatantly high production values, but just as Captain America is, deep down, still the scrawny, scrappy Steve Rogers, at the heart of the film lies the simple, noble intention of telling a good story and, hopefully, entertaining the audience while it's at it. It's this modesty that helps Captain America succeed where others have failed, or at least fallen short.Much has been made of the recent glut of superhero and comic book-based movies. There are only so many origin stories, prequels, sequels, spin-offs and reboots most people can take before they all begin to look the same. While I would argue that this genre is as valid as any other (romantic comedies have seen little internal change even though they've been around for decades, but do you ever hear someone demand they no longer be made?), the truth is that, though they may now be high in quantity, the quality of the majority of these superhero films has been sub-par. Perhaps this stems from the difficulty of balancing the needs of the comics' vicious, passionate fan bases with those of the average movie-goer. Regardless of the reasons, not since 2008's formidable duo of Iron Man and The Dark Knight has any superhero movie made a real impact; even box-office returns have largely been nothing special.Just when it looked like we'd have to wait yet another year, along comes Captain America. Though it is nowhere near as weighty or transcendent as Chris Nolan's Batman movies, it follows closer in the footsteps of Jon Favreau's surprise hit, which similarly took a B-list comic book character and turned him into the star of a wildly enjoyable blockbuster. Like Iron Man, Captain America works because, despite some flashy visuals, cartoonish action sequences and mythic gobbledy-gook, the film-makers and writers never lose sight of the characters or their motivations, keeping the story grounded even in its most fantastical moments. Recent Marvel films, like Iron Man 2, have felt like nothing more than superfluous and lazy marketing gimmicks whose soul purpose was to set up next year's The Avengers, which will unite all of Marvel's heroes in one film, but while studio execs probably had similar intentions for Captain America, Joe Johnston and his colleagues do not approach it as such. They treat it as a stand-alone film and, for the most part, the story arcs feel self-contained; the viewer's enjoyment is not dependent on prior knowledge or attachment based in separate movies or in the comics, though there are plenty of Easter eggs that will no doubt please those fans.The writing is unfussy, never overreaching in unnecessary attempts at grandeur, and the plot is easy to digest: basically, kill Nazis, or, more specifically, H.Y.D.R.A. soldiers, who are like super-Nazis with guns that shoot blue lasers instead of ordinary bullets. Though there are a few recognizable names and faces in the cast, Captain America benefits from a relative lack of true A-listers who might've made the production feel too crowded or chewed too much scenery. As our central hero, the very Aryan- (and buff)-looking Chris Evans does a fine job. Whether he is portraying Steve Rogers or his more muscular alter-ego, Evans never lets go of the heart and stubborn determination that drives his character from beginning to end. Among others, Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci and Toby Jones provide solid support, and Hugo Weaving still makes a mean villain, even if his German accent often sounds more like a British one. However, the real surprise here is unknown actress Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, who, in a breath of fresh air, is the first superhero heroine I can remember who is never forced into the role of victim or damsel-in-distress. Bearing a striking resemblance to Scarlett Johanssen, albeit with brown hair and a light British accent, Atwell plays Peggy Carter with grace and poise, more than holding her own against her more seasoned male counterparts.The film's only significant misstep comes at the end with an epilogue that is tacked on after the story's surprisingly emotional climax. Though comic book fans will be familiar with the twist, the conclusion lacks the closure needed to be truly satisfying. Fortunately, like Marvel's other movies, Captain America features a post-credits tag, and for the fanboys (and girls) out there, boy, oh, boy is it worth the wait.",8,2,7,2 August 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," The darkest and best chapter (so far) of a beloved saga
","When people ask whether I like Harry Potter, I find myself in an awkward position. On one hand, ever since my mom first read me The Sorcerer's Stone when I was eight, I have been enchanted by the world J.K. Rowling brought to life, and for a time, I read the books voraciously, tearing through each one multiple times in a row. On the other hand, I found the final two books a severe letdown after hundreds of pages of rising anticipation, and the movies, while satisfactory, always seemed to be missing something. With the possible exception of the first film, they lacked that magical spark, that sense of wonder and mystery, that made the books so special.Nonetheless, after seeing David Yates's adaptation of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Part 1), I was reminded of why I'd loved Harry Potter so much as a kid. Perhaps it was the knowledge that the end of the franchise is imminent, but for the first time in my history of watching Harry Potter movies, I was genuinely captivated. This entry had a vivacity and spirit that was absent from its predecessors, which were decent revisions of Rowling's books but not particularly great movies. Energetic and poignant, Deathly Hallows finally managed to surmount that trend.From the very first scene, depicting a conference of sorts between the Death Eaters and Voldemort, it is obvious that this is not going to be a cheerful movie. While the previous few installments, beginning with the Goblet of Fire, have gradually grown darker and more serious, none of those can compare to the bleakness that pervades Deathly Hallows, both thematically and visually. Even during the day-time scenes, shades of black, gray and blue suffuse the screen, a world away from the radiant Diagon Alley and flamboyant Hogwarts uniforms in the first film, helping to accentuate the perpetually melancholy atmosphere. In fact, some parts of the film, especially one sequence involving a snake and flies, are downright creepy; during my screening, several of the younger audience members noticeably cringed with fright at some of the more spine-chilling moments. All this darkness is not superfluous. If it hadn't been before, it is now clear how much is at stake, and the shift of action away from Hogwarts provides not only a breath of fresh air, a welcome escape from the confines of the school, but it also compels audiences to fully realize the danger Voldemort poses to both the magical and Muggle worlds. The Death Eaters's regime as they take over the Ministry of Magic is startlingly reminiscent of Nazi Germany, evoking serious issues such as prejudice and genocide.Even more than the visuals, though, the film's intense emotion is conveyed by its terrific, well-rounded cast. In the fashion of many epics, Harry Potter is truly an ensemble movie, perhaps confirmed by the fact that despite critical acclaim, the Academy has yet to give a single actor in the franchise a nomination, and the veteran performers, many of whom are celebrated British actors, fit in flawlessly, showing off their collective talent yet never upstaging their younger costars. It is a simultaneously fascinating and moving experience to watch Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson on screen, as you both marvel at how well they have matured and fondly recall the three youths we were first introduced to almost ten years ago. Because of their rich, unaffected performances, Harry, Hermione and Ron feel real and multidimensional, not much different from any teenager you'd see on the street, and their effortless chemistry strengthens the sense of camaraderie shared by the three adolescents, which in turn helps form a deep emotional connection with the audience. In part because of the stars' apparent lack of glamour or vanity, we care about the characters they portray.Besides the cast, the most surprising element of this newest Harry Potter movie is David Yates's direction. Although he helmed the two previous installments, Yates never proved himself more competent and delightful than he does in the Deathly Hallows, handling the somber atmosphere and subject matter with finesse and managing to imbue the film with energy in even the darkest moments. Using the much-maligned yet undeniably effective 'shaky-cam', a technique I don't remember being employed in any of the previous films, he keeps the many action sequences lively, if a tad chaotic; it is not difficult to imagine the movie working well in 3D, as the film-makers originally planned. Equally impressive is Yates's ability to intersperse moments of humor and joy throughout the movie without detracting from its serious themes. In fact, one of the most memorable scenes, at least for me, was one in which Harry attempts to console a despondent Hermione by dancing with her; devoid of any romantic tension, this bittersweet scene simmers with youthful innocence, a casual reminder to the audience that even though the fate of the world hangs on their shoulders, these people are still kids who yearn for ordinary lives. It is ultimately moments like that, little flashes of life and humanity, that make this a truly memorable journey.",8,1,2,1 December 2010
Kung Fu Panda 2," Kung Fu Panda 2: Sequel packs less punch than original
","When the first Kung Fu Panda movie came out in May 2008, no one expected much. All anyone really knew was that the plot centered around a fat, martial-arts-oriented panda voiced by Jack Black, a pitch that doesn't quite scream gold of either the box-office or awards kind, and the trailer wasn't exactly the most innovative thing out there. Besides, this was Dreamworks, the studio whose trademark in films is a heavy reliance on pop culture references and broad satire to the point of overkill and whose greatest hit, arguably still the first Shrek at that point, had been diluted by a series of mediocre, unstoppable sequels; they weren't Pixar, after all. But then, something surprising happened: it premiered at Cannes to shockingly positive reviews, and when the audience also responded with fervor, gone were the Pixar comparisons. Instead, people began to buzz about the rich, colorful animation, Black's pitch-perfect voice casting as Po, the way it managed to be light and fun (not to mention funny) while still having a sweet, heartfelt message without the *wink wink* pretensions of films like Ice Age or Shark Tale, which always seemed to be trying too hard – and failing – to engage adults as well as younger folks. Kung Fu Panda wasn't just 'good for Dreamworks'; it was genuinely great.Given its status as a clear financial success, a sequel was probably inevitable. Though the surprise factor that helped the original stand out was now gone, it seemed to be a more promising venture than most. The main vocal talents were all returning, for one, and with box-office and critical hits like How to Train Your Dragon and Megamind under their belts, the guys at Dreamworks were steadily moving out of the shadow of their rival in the animation business.For the most part, Kung Fu Panda 2 is not a major disappointment. The plot is weightier with a villain who not only aims to bring all of China to its knees but also played a dark role in our hero's past, though the earnest intensity saps the movie of some of the optimistic energy that characterized the first one. Newcomer Gary Oldman makes for a lively and delightfully hateful, if fairly obvious, choice as the voice behind the evil peacock Lord Shen. However, the real strength of this movie lies in its visuals. Vivid colors and sweeping shots through mist-shrouded landscapes and old-fashioned villages make good use of 3-D, and the creatures that populate this world are expressive and detailed. The decision to render the dream and flashback sequences in a more traditional, hand-drawn style of animation proves effective and, at times, even poignant.If only this same joy and creativity could've gone beyond the aesthetics! Though, as previously stated, the plot is indeed more serious than the simple 'finding his destiny and overcoming expectations' setup of the first movie, it feels oddly stretched, particularly in the half-hour or so around the climax, which mostly consists of Shen trying over and over again to eliminate Po and Po miraculously escaping each time. What's more, a lot of the time seems to be spent on action sequences, which are mostly staged in too much of a swift blur to be truly impressive, and aside from a touching subplot about Po and his goose 'dad', character development is minimal; a greater focus on the interactions between Po and the individuals that make up the Furious Five would have been welcome. Despite their recognizable names, many of the voice actors are either indistinctive or underused, with the notable exceptions of Oldman, Black and Dustin Hoffman, though the last was MIA for the majority of the film's running time. In particular, Angelina Jolie should be tough and icily demanding as Tigress, but instead, comes off as merely bland. Though she was passable in the original, an expanded screen time provides too much exposure to the lack of personality in her voice.Still, discounting a plot that becomes fairly repetitive and casting complaints, Kung Fu Panda 2 is a more effective sequel than most. Those looking for some good family-friendly entertainment will no doubt be satisfied, and the spectacular visuals are a reward all on their own. Just don't bring your kid if he can't stay still throughout the whole movie. I got a couple of criers, in addition to a few that ran through the aisles during the last twenty minutes, and trust me, it's not fun for anyone involved.",7,1,2,13 June 2011
Hugo," Hugo: A Waking Dream
","Ask any film buff walking down the street who Martin Scorsese is, and they're likely to respond with something along the lines of 'living legend' or to mention Taxi Driver, Raging Bull or Goodfellas, perhaps the occasional After Hours or The Departed. With roughly half a century of filmmaking under his belt, the director has become revered for his dark, uncompromising looks into the human psyche, often focusing on seedy or morally ambiguous protagonists. Therefore, the news that his next project after the twisty, B-movie homage Shutter Island would be a kid-friendly fantasy, in 3D no less, was greeted with understandable skepticism by the film world. Despite its enormous departure from his usual tone and material, the result, however, feels like arguably the most personal of Scorsese's many works. Joining a host of other films from this year suffused with nostalgia, Hugo is a giddy, mischievous romp through 1930s Paris steadied by the confident hand of a master who not only knows his craft inside and out but is also madly, hopelessly, infectiously in love with it.That adoration permeates through every aspect of the movie, from the breezy performances and tone to the absolutely stunning visuals and the love letter to Georges Melies and silent films, an ode that might have come off as ham-handed had its intentions not been so blatantly earnest and pure. Indeed, there is an innocence to Hugo that is all the more surprising when compared to the gritty realism of the rest of Scorsese's oeuvre. It celebrates the magic and joys of cinema with childlike wonder, allowing the audience to get swept up in much the same way that the story's two young protagonists, Hugo and Isabel, are when they sneak into a theater to watch an old Harold Lloyd comedy, the way audiences were when the first moving picture came out and viewers ducked and screamed because they thought the train in the film was going to hit them. In spite of the decidedly 21st-century technology used to make the movie (though it must be noted that Hugo boasts the best use of modern 3D in a chiefly live-action film so far, as even Avatar used as much CGI and animation as live-action), Hugo feels cheerfully old-fashioned, featuring long sequences without dialogue, including the remarkable opening sequence, and a wonderful score by Howard Shore that not only evokes the proper setting, but the entire feel of that era; you can easily imagine hearing it over a Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton film. Also refreshing is the strictly platonic but heartfelt relationship between Hugo, an orphan who has lived in the Paris Nord train station since his father died in a fire and has a natural instinct to fix things, and Isabel, the god-daughter of a crotchety, old man who runs a toy shop in the station. They exude naiveté but are not dumb or overly cute, treated by the filmmakers with the same respect accorded the adults in the story.Another running trend through this year in film, in addition to the strong currents of nostalgia, has been the unusually strong performances from kids or teens, from the gang in Super 8 to Hunter McCracken in The Tree of Life and Kerris Dorsey in Moneyball. Though the youngsters here aren't necessarily the most impressive entries into that list, they both hold their own against their more seasoned costars. Asa Butterfield is passable as Hugo, able to convincingly play the character as both a lonely misfit and a smart kid who has learned quickly how to take care of himself, though there are moments when his emotions feel more forced and artificial than truly organic. However, it is Chloe Grace Moretz as Isabel who shines, radiating warmth, sincerity and a charming sweetness, a performance that is a far cry from her breakout role as the foul-mouthed Hit Girl in Kick-Ass; in the year since that movie came out, she has shown incredible range and, in Hugo, only further establishes that she is one of the most talented young actresses working today. Among the supporting players, a solid if eclectic group, Ben Kingsley, who portrays Georges Melies, seems likely to attract the most accolades, but perhaps the most surprising performance comes from Sasha Baron Cohen, who suggests here that he's capable of more than you'd think judging from Borat.However, despite some notable performances and a lovely script, it is the visuals that bring Hugo to life. Normally when someone says the visuals are the most impressive aspect of a film, they're referring to CGI-and-F/X bonanzas, and it's usually a criticism, suggesting that such technical proficiency only serves to distract from uninteresting characters or a weak plot, but Hugo shows that this doesn't always have to be the case and that it's not always a bad thing when set design or special effects steal the show. The period sets and costumes are flawless, feeling authentic with a slight touch of whimsy that adds to the film's fantastical, dreamlike atmosphere, and the many shots overlooking Paris are simply breathtaking. Scorsese creates a world that feels completely real, even when it clearly isn't, so much so that there's a dream sequence that audiences likely won't recognize as a dream until it is nearly over. It is a world where magic is real and dreams come to life, and it is this sensibility that makes Hugo such a stirring tribute to not just old, silent movies, but cinema as a whole, and to the power of the imagination.",8,4,6,5 December 2011
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Welcome to the land of ice and snow
","Three years ago, nobody took David Fincher seriously. People admired his visual artistry – he made even preposterous duds like Panic Room interesting with his imaginative camera-work – and his willingness to push the envelope, but even his most celebrated film, the cult favorite Fight Club, bombed at the box office and received disparaging, almost downright hostile, reviews upon its initial release in 1999. Then, in December 2008, the ambitious, long-gestating romance The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, a movie unlike anything Fincher had previously attempted, debuted to critical acclaim and eventually garnered a stunning thirteen Oscar nominations, including one for its director. In 2010, his next project, The Social Network, became the virtually undisputed Best Movie of the Year, sweeping the critics' awards and appearing on countless Top Ten lists, and suddenly, David Fincher was one of the most sought-after directors in Hollywood. Considering his previous filmography and his newfound popularity, it's little surprise that when Fincher was chosen to helm the American adaptation of Steig Larsson's wildly popular crime novel, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, the decision was met with much excitement and surprisingly little outrage. It was the perfect opportunity for Fincher to both prove his worth as a mainstream filmmaker and return to the darker, more audacious movies that jumpstarted his career.By all rights, the movie should be considered an undeniable success. Opening with a typically innovative, gorgeously nightmarish credits sequence set to the distorted, rollicking strains of a cover of Led Zeppelin masterwork 'Immigrant Song' by Karen O, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a fascinating tight-wire act of a movie, weaving a story of murder, rape, intrigue and vengeance that feels adequately gruesome and macabre but never abusive, once again demonstrating David Fincher's ability to handle graphic material with finesse. The director fuses together an ice-cold atmosphere (both literal and metaphorical, as the audience can practically feel the frigid Swedish weather through the screen), spine-tingling imagery and a taut score (courtesy of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, who won an Oscar for their work on The Social Network) to create almost relentless tension; even those who know every inch of the plot will find themselves on the edge of their seats for much of the running time. It goes without saying that this movie is not for the faint-hearted. Even so, Fincher surprisingly manages to devise moments of poignancy and even humor amid all the gloom, making this film slightly more enjoyable – if such a word can be used in this context – than the generally bleak source material and Swedish version. Devotees of Larsson's novel will be pleased that this adaptation is remarkably faithful, keeping the majority of the plot intact and making only a few minor tweaks. As far as the actors go, not a single misstep can be found. Despite his limited screen time, Christopher Plummer imbues the jaded Henrik Vanger with a nice mix of pathos and dry wit, and Stellan Skarsgard thankfully plays the cordial yet enigmatic Martin Vanger, brother of presumed murder victim, Harriet, with a chillingly understated menace, lending realism to a character that could easily have been overly manic or cartoonish. Daniel Craig takes a break from his usual macho-guy persona to embody the determined, albeit somewhat bland journalist Mikael Blomkvist, his hulking, age-worn physique lending credibility to the character's lofty ideals. Nonetheless, as in the novel, the undeniable star of the show is the tortured, antisocial computer hacker Lisbeth Salander, and, in the titular role, Rooney Mara is simply sensational. Previously known by most for playing Mark Zuckerberg's exasperated girlfriend in The Social Network, Mara became all but a household name when David Fincher chose her to play Salander, one of the most coveted roles of the century, as evidenced by the frenzied media coverage that accompanied the seemingly endless search process, during which such A-list actresses as Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johannson were allegedly considered. Viewing the final product, it's obvious Fincher made the right choice. Mara, ordinarily a rather unassuming brunette, is unrecognizable with her dyed-black hair, heavy make-up, multiple body piercings, tattered Goth clothing and near-anorexic frame, yet more impressive than her physical transformation is the way she nails Lisbeth's volatile psychological state, her fragile yet explosive personality. Through her haunted eyes and guarded posture, she conveys myriad emotions at once, alternating between passion and vulnerability, belligerence and anguish, tenacity and insecurity to create a complex, mesmerizing character that dominates the screen simply by being there.And yet, something doesn't feel quite right. For all its perfectly calibrated suspense, the movie left me, if not disappointed, then slightly empty, as though something vital was missing; even now, I can't quite figure out why. Maybe it's the story itself, which I find overly convoluted and rather unfocused (I was never a huge fan of the book). Maybe it's the fact that, despite having both read the novel and seen the Swedish adaptation, I let the feverishly edited teaser trailer trick me into believing that the movie would be a kinetic, fast-paced thriller rather than the slow-burning mystery that it actually is. Or maybe – and this seems the most likely explanation – I'm just tired of the detached, methodical air that has saturated Fincher's recent work, even the ostensibly warm Benjamin Button. Don't get me wrong: I adore The Social Network as much as the next person, and I was captivated by 2007's Zodiac. But what happened to the dynamic brio of Fight Club? Technically, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is flawless – almost too flawless, if that's possible. The whole affair is so measured, so painstaking, that it's honestly not that fun to watch; I suppose this could be more to do with my own expectations than the movie itself, but I somehow wish it was more stylish, more liberated and adventurous, more like the old David Fincher. I liked it, but I wanted to love it.",8,3,8,4 January 2012
District 9," A thrilling and unique take on an old genre
","District 9 is probably the biggest surprise hit of the year so far that isn't really a surprise. Made on an incredibly low budget (compared to the majority of Hollywood summer blockbusters) and featuring no big names except for Peter Jackson, who produced the film, this unique sci-fi action thriller surrounding aliens who live in slums in Johannesburg after their ship stopped above the South African city earned twice the amount of money it cost to make...in its opening weekend. And it deserves every cent of that box office gross. The Hollywood studios that released such deafening, incoherent summer movies as Transformers 2 or G.I. Joe should take a look at this film from little-known director Neill Blomkamp and see it as proof that you can make an intelligent blockbuster and that audiences actually will see it. Not only are the special effects incredible, but the movie's actual plot is intriguing and profound.By styling the film like a documentary, Blomkamp creates tension right from the opening sequence, where numerous people, from employees of MNU (Multi-National United) to sociologists and scientists, take turns describing the alien situation. This also helps enhance the movie's gritty, uncompromising tone and gives it a fresh feel. Instead of an expensive set, the crew used real locations to film, accentuating the movie's realistic mood; you really feel as though you have been transported to a desolate slum in the middle of Johannesburg. We filmgoers have seen many films surrounding extra-terrestrials, most of them nothing more than showcases for the latest in CGI and F/X technology, but District 9 does not feel like anything we have seen before. The special effects are used to support the story, not the other way around.Even so, you cannot help but marvel at the way Blomkamp and his tech crew managed to create something so convincing with so little money. The aliens look more realistic than anything featured in Transformers 2, and they did it with no more than 20 million compared to the Transformers's 200 million. In fact, it looks so real that when, for example, one character's fingernails begin to spontaneously fall out, you feel obligated to glance at your own fingernails to make sure they're still perfectly secure. This is only a fraction of the violence and gore, and this movie is clearly not for the queasy. District 9 never flinches when it comes to showing blood and...well, anything. Intense and graphic, it hides nothing and does not hesitate to throw the viewer right into the middle of the action.Of course, there is much more to appreciate about District 9 than the makers' astute handling of the budget. Blomkamp and his casting director made the smart choice in casting only unknowns; the lack of a familiar face heightens the realism and compels us to care about the characters because of the characters themselves, not the actors who portray them. Sharlto Copley does a commendable job as Wikus Van de Merwe, a worker in the MNU Alien Affairs department and the central character in the film. He is aided by strong performances by Vanessa Haywood, who plays his wife, and the rest of the supporting cast. The humans aren't the only ones who turn in good performances, though. Though they are entirely CGI, the aliens or 'prawns', a derogatory term used by humans throughout the film, particularly Christopher Johnson, the most prolific of the extraterrestrials, are complex yet sympathetic. You can often see their emotions and thoughts in their big yellow eyes, and it is not hard to convince yourself to root for them; at times, they are even more likable than the protagonist, who is good but flawed.Finally, what really sets District 9 apart from the bulk of alien movies is the underlying allegory concerning immigration. Like many refugees, the aliens are forced to reside in substandard slums that separate them from the indigenous population and they are often treated with malice and suspicion by others. Most people have commented on the ties to the apartheid apparent in the film, but many of the messages and themes can also be connected to events in the United States. When a riot breaks out in district 9, I was reminded of the footage often shown of the Los Angeles riots in the '70s, and the relationship between the prawns and humans echos the racial discrimination that has characterized much of American history. In fact, there is no coincidence that the word 'alien' is often used to refer to someone who is foreign or different from oneself. At one point, an interviewee comments that it would not matter if the aliens were from a different country, but it does matter because they came from another planet. This brings up two points: one, why does it matter if they are from a different planet? How much difference is there between a country and a planet? And second, it is hypocritical, because even today, a big deal is made out of foreigners moving into another country. In short, if the aliens were only from the neighboring country, not another planet, the locals would be just as contemptuous of them.Ultimately, aided by incredible special effects, a solid cast and masterful direction, District 9 poses a single question: How can we, as humans, expect to peacefully co-exist with a different species when we can barely co-exist with each other?",8,3,6,29 August 2009
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol is blockbuster escapism at its best
","It's been fifteen years since Tom Cruise first exploded into movie theaters as superspy Ethan Hunt, a role that catapulted him to the upper echelons of modern-day action heroes, and now, with the release of the fourth and arguably the strongest installment of the Mission: Impossible franchise, he shows little sign of slowing down. Directed with aplomb by Pixar's Brad Bird, Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol is smart, stylish and, most importantly, as entertaining a film as one could ever hope for.Like its predecessors, Ghost Protocol boasts only the skeleton of a plot, which this time around, centers on a bombing at the Kremlin and rogue Russians attempting to incite a nuclear holocaust for reasons that are never fully explained. Still, for the most part, it's easy to follow, with the team's step-by-step goals clearly laid out, a definite improvement over the nonsensicality of the third movie, and considering that the franchise has always put story secondary to spectacle and extravagant action set pieces (which, frankly, isn't such a bad thing, at least not this time), it's hard to imagine many people coming into the theater expecting a fully fleshed-out, intricate or particularly creative plot. The only genuinely problematic moment occurs at the end with a last-minute twist that feels forced, more like a cop-out than the satisfying resolution it's no doubt supposed to be.Propelled along by a pulse-pounding score from the always reliable Michael Giacchino, Ghost Protocol features almost wall-to-wall action, punctuated only occasionally by some perfunctory exposition and character development. Fortunately, Brad Bird, who is making his live-action debut here and, with animated films The Iron Giant, The Incredibles and Ratatouille already under his belt, is now four-for-four, is at the helm, and boy, does he know how to stage action. Elaborate and ambitious but grounded enough to never become laughably over-the-top or ridiculous, each sequence is executed with such pizazz and creativity, filled with such tension that the nonstop action never feels tedious or repetitive; it is relentlessly enjoyable to watch. In a refreshing change of pace, Bird opts to not rely on techniques like the shaky camera or slow motion that film-makers seem to employ all too often these days, knowing that such stylizations are more often suffocating than beneficial. Taking advantage of exotic locales like Russia, Dubai and Mumbai, as well as the IMAX format, he lets each stunt and set piece speak for itself, capturing it all with the steady hand and keen eye of someone who knows precisely what he's doing. Each M:I film has had a different director, but if there is another sequel, and there almost certainly will be, Brad Bird is more than welcome to be the first to return for seconds.Brad Bird has also been gifted with a cast that is more than up for the challenges he throws at them. Tom Cruise and Simon Pegg are the only returning major cast members, though both Ving Rhames and Michelle Monaghan pop up briefly. They are joined by the white-hot Jeremy Renner as the mild-mannered but enigmatic analyst Brandt, Paula Patton, who is surprisingly convincing in the obligatory female role, and Mikael Nyqvist, who is best known for the Swedish version of The Millennium trilogy and doesn't get a whole lot to do here as the villain but is more than adequate with what he has; Tom Wilkinson and Lost's Josh Holloway also make cameo appearances. What the characters lack in depth, the actors make up for in pure charisma. It's a blast watching them do their thing.Though this movie focuses more on the team as a whole instead of the usual lone-wolf approach, it's still undeniably Cruise's showcase. Despite the crow's feet and bags emerging under his eyes revealing that he is not, in fact, immune to aging, he is remarkably fit and never seems to strain even slightly while performing the high-risk stunts he has developed a reputation for, including the much-buzzed-about Burj Khalifa sequence. It's hard to believe that he's approaching fifty years old. However, age is not the only challenge the actor has faced recently. In the years since the first Mission: Impossible, the star of Tom Cruise has faded somewhat, tarnished by personal controversies and general audience indifference to traditional movie stars, and of late, his public persona has more often than not overshadowed his work. It doesn't help that, with the exception of the underrated Nazi thriller Valkyrie and a memorable turn in the otherwise unremarkable Tropic Thunder, the vast majority of his recent projects have been mediocre. It seems fitting that Ghost Protocol would be the movie where he finally regains some of his old mojo, serving as a welcome, charming reminder of why he's one of the last true superstars left in the business.Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol is no cinematic game-changer, but it doesn't need to be one. In turning out a film that is simply engaging, exhilarating, carefree, unadulterated fun, Brad Bird, Tom Cruise and co. can consider their mission accomplished.",8,10,16,2 January 2012
Revolutionary Road," An emotional and dramatic insight into the 'American dream'
","When I read the book last summer, I was mesmerized by Richard Yate's unsentimental, realistic portrayal of suburban life in the 1950s. He presented a young couple whose dreams of happiness and excitement are grounded by reality and responsibility. What is so unique about this story is the fact that the feelings that the couple (Frank and April Wheeler) experience could apply to anyone, no matter where or when you live. Unlike many stories set during this time period, Revolutionary Road is still relevant today.All this is perfectly captured in Sam Mendes' startling adaptation. Like in American Beauty, he does a magnificent job of bringing out the emotions of the characters and conveying the hopelessness of their situation. The characters are all flawed in various ways, but Mendes effectively turns these flawed people into three-dimensional, realistic humans that we ultimately come to care about - at least that's how I felt. We can identify with their hopes, fears and desires and we understand what feelings motivate them to take make sometimes drastic, even immature, choices. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, as the two leading characters, seem to effortlessly take on the mannerisms and personalities of their respective roles. Before the first ten minutes are over, we completely forget about their idealized romance in Titanic and they BECOME Frank and April Wheeler, a tragic couple torn apart by their clashing hopes and dreams and their inability to fully understand each other the way they had when they were younger and full of life and optimism. Both of them bring just the right intensity and emotion to their scenes, and we forgive them for their mistakes and flaws because they are quite simply human. Although the entire supporting cast is good, the main standout is Michael Shannon as John Givings, the son of a 'friend' of the Wheelers who is currently residing in a mental institute. He brings the perfect blend of brashness, confidence and magnetism to his character and it's satisfying to see that his work is being recognized. He manages to convince us, simultaneously, that he is as insane as they say yet, perhaps, that he is saner than any of the other characters. Providing the heavily dramatic and uber-serious movie with an occasional comedic moment, Shannon proves here that he has the acting chops to match the daunting, impressive presences and talents of DiCaprio and Winslet.In addition to a top-notch cast, Revolutionary Road boasts a subtly beautiful score, dazzling cinematography and fine costumes that truly represent, not only the time period, but the entire tone and message of the movie. Also, while making a few detours, the script stays faithful to the novel it is based on and does an excellent job of translating the book's feel, even though much of the emotion and drama in the novel comes more from the narration, what the characters are NOT saying, as opposed to the dialogue itself.All in all, while it might not be for those seeking an uplifting escape from reality, Revolutionary Road is a poignant, deeply thought-provoking look at life in the suburbs, a failing relationship and the complex labyrinth of the human mind.",9,1,4,24 January 2009
Cars 2," An enjoyable, if uneven, ride
","It seems cliché nowadays to critique Pixar's work by comparing it to their previous resume, but at a certain point, it is unavoidable. After two decades of churning out successful, critically acclaimed films, Pixar's name has become synonymous with quality animation, making them almost indisputably the most trustworthy studio in Hollywood. However, such a lofty reputation elicits even loftier standards. Considering the fact that general consensus has established that Cars is Pixar's worst film (meaning it is only very good instead of spectacular), it is no surprise that the release of that movie's sequel was met with comparatively low expectations. I'll be the first to admit that I thoroughly enjoyed the first Cars and find its status undeserved (both Monsters, Inc. and A Bug's Life are mediocre, in my humble opinion), so I prayed that Cars 2 would surprise everyone by continuing Pixar's streak – and besides, at least at the time, a spy movie with cars seemed kind of genius. Did they deliver on this promise? Not quite. What I got was a jumbled yet consistently entertaining combination between a winking homage to old-timey espionage thrillers and a kid-friendly tale about animated cars. And hey: if nothing else, it looked stunning.I'll start with what worked. Of course, the visuals were absolutely gorgeous, even for Pixar. The various landscapes (our protagonists jumped all across the globe, stopping by Tokyo, Paris, Italy and London, among other exotic locales) leapt off the screen, alive with color and detail, making the action scenes especially vivid, and I'll never cease to be amazed by Pixar's ability to give inanimate objects such as cars and toys seemingly genuine emotion. I might even venture to say that Cars 2 is Pixar's most aesthetically impressive project to date, except for, perhaps, Wall-E. Also as expected, the voice talent is impeccable. The entire main cast from the first Cars is present, excluding, of course, the late Paul Newman, and as before they all blend nicely into their characters, but of the newcomers, Michael Caine (appropriately suave as the British spy car, Finn McMissile) is the standout. While not quite as noteworthy, Emily Mortimer, Eddie Izzard and John Turturro provide adequate support. Both of these elements combined with frequently sharp dialogue to lend unexpected verve to the proceedings. There is not a dull moment throughout, and as a fan of genre movies, I particularly appreciated the homage to classic spy films, which was not only clever and audacious but also, for the most part, well-executed.The part that didn't work so well, however, was the sequel. After the Toy Story sequels, Pixar proved that they are fully capable of successfully giving new depth to old plot lines and characters, but the lighthearted story about friendship established by Cars does not mesh well with the more sleek, high-octane concept of Cars 2, resulting in a movie that feels erratic and confused. The leap from Radiator Springs to Europe and Asia is jarring, and the genre-blending at which Pixar usually excels instead comes off as clumsy, much as it did in Wall-E (which many critics adored but I found well-intentioned and visually breathtaking yet ultimately flawed). Much of the problem lies with the ill-advised decision to take Owen Wilson's Lightning McQueen out of the spotlight and replace him with Larry the Cable Guy's Mater. In the first Cars, Mater provided a likable, energetic counterpart to the more self-serious Lightning McQueen, but as the central character, he is uninteresting and even, at times, irritating; the audience sympathizes with him but doesn't really root for him. As a result, despite some attempts at a rather muddled and erroneous message about staying true to yourself (apparently regardless of standard rules of courtesy), Cars 2 lacks what makes most Pixar movies stand out: heart. You never get the sense that Mater – or any of the characters, for that matter – is going to change by the end, so, really, what's the point?",6,0,1,14 July 2011
The Hurt Locker," The Hurt Locker: (finally!) an Iraq War movie done right!
","If I could describe Kathryn Bigelow's latest movie, 'The Hurt Locker', in one word, it would be: authentic. This is an Iraq War movie that neither glorifies nor condemns the conflict; it simply shows it. This film provides a glimpse into the lives of three soldiers that dismantle bombs for a living, a dangerous job inside an already dangerous job. Everything feels real - from the landscape to the way the soldiers talk and the weapons they carry. Consider the way one soldier breathes when wearing a several-pound mask. We, the viewers, have been transported to Iraq yet, unlike the real-life soldiers, we get the opportunity to experience it all from the safety of our own home or our hometown theater.The you-are-there realism of the movie must be, in large part, contributed to director Kathryn Bigelow, who must surely be up for an Oscar nomination for her work here. She manages to sustain the tension and audience's interest throughout a movie where the same thing essentially happens over and over, albeit with small complications arising each time. While there are some stylized moments, they are far and few in between and she never hesitated to show a scene in its grittiest, most realistic state. Nothing is glossed over and every moment is raw and intense. Much of this is enhanced by the work of Barry Ackroyd, the cinematographer that also worked on Paul Greengrass's terrific United 93, and by the music, which is used sparingly throughout the film but is always effective when it does crop up.Credit must also go to Mark Boal, who co-produced and wrote the screenplay. Boal drew from his own experiences as a journalist in Iraq for the script, and his knowledge of the Iraq War as it is in reality greatly enhances the movie. There is one particular scene that jumps to mind where one of the soldiers is forced to clean blood off ammunition with his own spit so that the blood does not jam the bullets in the gun. It also shows in his portrayal of the soldiers themselves, in the dialogue and the very psychological state of their minds. He depicts them as complex individuals and chooses to focus solely on the way they look at the war, as a lifestyle, never letting politics or ideologies interfere.Said soldiers would never have been quite as convincing without a talented cast to portray them. According to rumors, Colin Farrell, William Dafoe and Charlize Theron were originally set to star. Kathryn Bigelow later dismissed those rumors, insisting that she had always intended to cast unknowns. While I think the above actors are talented, Bigelow made the right move in using little-known actors. Because we do not see their faces on magazines by the check-out counters in every grocery store, it is easy to believe that these men are actually soldiers; they look like soldiers. As the central protagonist, team leader and adrenaline addict Staff Sergeant William James, Jeremy Renner does a brilliant job and should get, at the very least, Oscar consideration for his performance. He plays James with reckless bravado but just enough sensitivity to allow the audience to feel his character's inner turmoil and struggles. Renner has - justly - garnered magnificent praise for his performance, yet it occasionally overshadows his costars. Brian Geraghty and Anthony Mackie as Specialist Owen Eldridge and Sergeant JT Sanborn, respectively, both deliver convincing, engaging and often touching performances. While the central characters are all portrayed by unknowns, Bigelow got a couple of more famous actors for cameos. Guy Pearce is Sergeant Matt Thompson, an EOD team leader and James's predecessor, in the opening sequence, and Ralph Fiennes appears as the leader of a team of contracted, British mercenaries. Evangeline Lilly, who is most well-known for her skillful, heartrending portrayal as Kate in ABC's phenomenal, hit-show Lost, shows up in a few short scenes as Will James's wife, Connie. All three do solid jobs, managing to inject their characters with distinctive personalities in the short screen time they are allotted yet never stealing the scene from the main actors as A-listers in cameos often do.The Hurt Locker, visually striking in addition to its expert direction, writing and acting, is arguably the best war movie of this decade. The movie delves in the psyche of the soldiers with unapologetic yet insightful intensity, and the result is best summed up by a phrase in the quote that opens the movie: 'War is a drug.' This is demonstrated most powerfully in the quietest scene of the movie: Staff Sergeant Will James, home from combat, surveys a vast aisle of cereal while at the supermarket with his wife and child. Without any dialogue, Jeremy Renner and Kathryn Bigelow somehow convey the soldier's exact thoughts and feelings to the audience, his sense of ennui with the mundane comforts and simplicity of civilian life after the exhilaration of disarming bombs in Iraq. We feel this with him, and suddenly, we understand. The men and women in the U.S. Armed Forces do not necessarily return to combat because of their patriotism or ideals, but because they cannot figure out how to transition back to normal life, because they are addicted to war - or, perhaps more specifically, the rush that comes with putting your life on the line every day.In one scene, Specialist Eldridge has a one-on-one conversation with Colonel John Cambridge (played by Christian Camargo), who tries to counsel the younger soldier. Eldridge argues that Cambridge should not be trying to tell him how to feel or how to cope with the stresses of EOD work because you cannot understand what he and his fellow team members go through unless you experience it yourself. Perhaps he is right, that we cannot understand what soldiers do and why unless we physically enter the field of combat. But, with The Hurt Locker, we are at least a step closer.",9,3,8,2 August 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A flawed yet technically brilliant achievement
","When I walked out of the theater after seeing The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, I really had no idea how to describe it. On one hand, it is a technical masterpiece with jaw-dropping visual effects and perhaps some of the most realistic makeup in any movie I've ever seen. The process of seeing Benjamin Button (played with brilliant subtlety by Brad Pitt) and his lifelong love, Daisy (Cate Blanchett) grow younger and older, respectively, marks an astonishing revolution in the technology of the movie-making industry. There is not a single scene or moment that does not look just spectacular. Unfortunately, the visuals were so great that the story itself did not quite rise to the challenge.The screenplay, written by Eric Roth and based on a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, has striking similarities to Forrest Gump, which was also written by Roth. That's not necessarily a bad thing. It certainly contains plenty of clever, original dialogue and touching scenes, but it's impossible to miss the connections to the 1994 Best Picture winner. Of course, there are many similar elements between the two movies (both show the aging and growth of a man who is, in some way, a bit of an outcast; they tell important messages about life and death while channeling several different eras in recent history), but the quality and tone of the film itself is different enough to make it feel unique. While Forrest Gump focused mostly on the intricacies of the characters and plot, Button puts more emphasis on the overall themes and morals of the story. In fact, the main flaw in the screenplay is not its similarities to Forrest Gump, but in its structure. Like Gump, the central story is told in a sort of flashback form and frequently returns to the present. While these scenes do occasionally help with the story and emotion, many of them, particularly at the beginning, feel unnecessary and interrupt with the flow of the story. If the script had stayed more focused on the actual plot, the emotion might have been stronger and, perhaps, it would've been easier to truly get to know and connect with the main characters.Aside from the visuals, Benjamin Button does exceed in other ways. As mentioned before, Brad Pitt gives a terrific yet subtle performance worthy of an Oscar nomination. Cate Blanchett plays Daisy straight while bringing out the more troubled side of her character. The result is an interesting dynamic between the two actors and a convincing romance that never strays into formulaic or too-familiar territory. For me, many of the movie's best scenes were the ones showing their relationship and how it grows and changes over time as the two characters head in completely different directions only to inevitably meet up again. The supporting cast is solid with noteworthy performances from Taraji P. Henson as Benjamin's adoptive mother and Tilda Swinton, who plays a married woman with whom he has a brief affair, but the movie never really delves into the finer details of their characters, so that they never feel quite as deep or real as they could have. Even Benjamin Button and Daisy have an almost enigmatic aura about them and, even with the voice-over narration, we never truly get into their heads and find out exactly what they're thinking.One other thing worth mentioning is David Fincher's direction. This is his first PG-13 rated movie and, being someone with films like Fight Club, Zodiac and Se7en on his resume, he is venturing into unknown territory. However, he seems confident with the material and he lends the film a unique tone that is alternately fantastical and somber. He manages to display the groundbreaking visual effects without ever making them distracting or overly showy. Even the makeup and CGI used to age Brad Pitt 80 years over the course of the film never say 'Here! Look at me!' We automatically recognize how revolutionary they are and they blend in perfectly with the film. Also, he has a way of making the quieter scenes both intimate and strangely detached at the same time. As viewers, we feel as though were merely observing the characters and we don't necessarily feel entirely absorbed in their world, but, partly because of the talented cast, we come to care about what happens to Benjamin and Daisy.The film concentrates heavily on themes of mortality and living every moment of life to its fullest. While it occasionally comes on a bit too strong, it is really a moving message and it is delivered powerfully, making viewers start to reflect on their own life and achievements. It teaches us to cherish every moment, every opportunity and person that comes by because we never know when they might be gone. 'Life is a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.' And if Benjamin Button had anything to add to Forrest Gump's now iconic saying, it would be this: You should treasure every individual piece in that box, because before you know it, that box will be empty.",8,1,3,16 February 2009
The Dark Knight," In 'The Dark Knight', Christopher Nolan finds light among the shadows
","In his successful reboot of the Batman franchise, Christopher Nolan has accomplished an admirable feat: he has taken a scorned, ridiculed series and transformed it into a near-masterpiece of modern crime noir that feels frighteningly close to home. Since its widely publicized release in July 2008, The Dark Knight has almost universally become known as the best adaptation of a superhero comic book in history, and while the film is not by all means perfect, this status is hard to debate.From the very first opening shot of Gotham City, Nolan enthralls his audience in the movie. Especially when viewed in IMAX, one cannot help but gape with awe at the film's spectacular visuals, from the opening bank robbery - an ingenious imitation of the famous heist in Michael Mann's 1995 crime drama Heat - to the thrilling Batpod chase scene (enhanced by the fact that, like most of the film's special effects, the flipped truck was real, not CGI). The masterful cinematography helps generate a bleak, murky atmosphere that not only increases the suspense, but also reflects the ambiguous principles of the movie's protagonist. Almost instantly, it becomes clear that The Dark Knight is not just another mindless action blockbuster; in actuality, it is more of a crime drama, a gritty meditation on corruption, honor and morality. Ultimately, it is not cheap explosions and elaborate action set pieces that captivate the viewer, but instead the film's underlying themes and, above all, the epic battle of wills between Christian Bale's Batman and Heath Ledger's Joker. And it cannot be denied that this eternal struggle is arguably one of the most engrossing conflicts presented in recent cinema. Christian Bale imbues his iconic antihero with a sense of grim, pensive dignity, making the audience alternately admire his courageous determination and abhor his ruthless ambition. Unlike most superheroes, Batman feels less like a glorified deity and more like a complex, three-dimensional human being. Screenwriters Christopher and Jonathan Nolan must be commended for effectively breathing life into this character that could easily have become little more than a caricature, providing him with secrets, desires, hopes, motivations and fears, all the while maintaining his mysterious temperament. On the flip side, Heath Ledger's Joker has quickly evolved into one of the most famed screen villains of all-time along with the likes of Anthony Hopkins's Hannibal Lecter and James Earl Jones's Darth Vader. Ledger's performance is nothing short of superlative. The young, amiable actor - otherwise known mostly for his heartrending portrayal of the forlorn cowboy Ennis Del Mar in 2005's Brokeback Mountain - completely vanishes behind the Joker's creepy, haphazard mask of make-up, expertly crafting a character that is both sinister and haunting, a twisted, merciless psychopath who somehow manages to feel believable and down-to-earth. The shadow of Heath Ledger's tragic, untimely death lingers throughout, adding an eerily poignant layer to his performance, yet it never overwhelms the malicious, tormented persona he has created. Perhaps more than anything else, the passionate, tumultuous friction between Christian Bale and Heath Ledger - epitomized in the now-famous interrogation scene - helped elevate The Dark Knight above the normal confines of its genre and into the realm of classic cinema.The rest of the cast does a bravura job of supporting the two leads. Most notable is Aaron Eckhart, who is equally convincing as the noble, saintly D.A. Harvey Dent and as the bitter, anguished Two-Face; he provides a steady, levelheaded foil to rival Christian Bale's haughty Bruce Wayne. In addition, Gary Oldman lends an emotional nuance to James Gordon not evident in the previous installment, and Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are always reliable as Alfred the butler and Lucius Fox, respectively. The only questionable performance comes from Maggie Gyllenhaal as the idealistic Rachel Dawes. Her chemistry with Christian Bale does not match the restrained tenderness that Bale shared with Katie Holmes in Batman Begins, and her matter-of-fact attitude does not seem to suit her more quixotic character. Still, Gyllenhaal makes an honest effort and over time, the viewer comes to appreciate the candid prudence she brings to the screen.Much of The Dark Knight revolves around the Freudian idea that evil resides within the heart of all humans. While in Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne/Batman was portrayed mostly as an honorable guardian of integrity, this time, he is constantly characterized as an obsessive, even deranged vigilante. The film-makers take care to emphasize the thin line between defender and criminal that Batman treads so closely, utilizing dark lighting and a dynamic score, mostly forsaking the heroic theme melody in favor of a more chilling arrangement. Also, many people have noticed that The Dark Knight focuses much more on Batman as opposed to Bruce Wayne. While the fact that he spends a great deal of his screen time behind a mask could easily detract from Christian Bale's performance or diminish his character's personality, this oddly clever move shows how Bruce Wayne himself is slowly being consumed by his alter ego, evolving into a faceless, coldblooded icon, his energy and life bent toward fulfilling a single unattainable goal: to rid Gotham of evil. At some point or another, each character is forced to flirt with the gray area between right and wrong, and the audience watches as one by one, they find either salvation or oblivion. Remarkably, however, Christopher Nolan manages to stop the film from becoming nothing more than a cynical diatribe on the flaws of humanity. Sparks of humor are sprinkled throughout the movie, such as the time when Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent dine together or the many wry conversations between Bruce and Alfred, to contrast the otherwise relentless solemnity. In the end, the audience emerges from the gloom and sorrow to discover hope - the fervent belief in man's ability to improve himself and the world around him - because above all, The Dark Knight is a movie about redemption and the promise of rebirth after devastation.",8,1,4,2 August 2008
Avatar," The movie event of 2009 is here: does 'Avatar' live up to the hype?
","At last, three weeks after its original release date, I have managed to see Avatar. The hype for this movie was unbelievable as many claim that it is revolutionary and will change the future of film-making; while it is not yet clear exactly how much of an impact Avatar will have on the industry in the long-term, as entertainment and a theater experience, it is more than satisfactory.Of course, the most prominent and talked-about element of the movie is its phenomenal special effects. For probably the first time in film history, a director has seamlessly integrated CGI, animation and live-action and particularly in 3D, the result is a fully immersing experience, the sensation that the viewer has been transported from the movie theater and into the fantastical world created by James Cameron and his crew. With an array of interesting creatures and vibrant, breathtaking landscapes, Pandora becomes alive on-screen and a sense of wonder and mystery lingers throughout the movie as the audience explores this fictional planet along with the characters.However, no movie can truly be good without an engaging story and interesting characters worth rooting for (or against). Thankfully, though the plot is hardly the most creative or unpredictable one out there, Cameron, who wrote the screenplay in addition to directing, does an admirable job. At the core of the story is Jake Sully, an ex-Marine who is recruited to participate in an avatar program used for both corporate business ventures and scientific research. This character could easily have become a caricature - the ignorant outsider who turns into a martyr for the oppressed natives - but Sam Worthington imbues Jake with a sort of zeal and curious yet brash swagger that makes him human and, ultimately, a very sympathetic protagonist. Any other actor might have made Jake too bitter and cynical at the beginning of the film and, post-transformation, too self-righteous and altruistic. But Worthington takes a more subtle approach, using body language and minute changes in his facial expression to convey the thoughts and emotions of his character. He makes Jake's transformation believable and natural.Although Sam Worthington gives the movie's most impressive performance, the rest of the cast provides strong support for him. Many roles, especially Sigourney Weaver's Dr. Grace Augustine and Stephen Lang's Colonel Miles Quaritch, present several opportunities for the actors to do a little scenery-chewing, but they all show a reasonable amount of restraint, allowing the focus to stay on Jake and whoever else is important to a given scene. Though one might think that the heavy use of motion-capture and the fact that, much of the time, the only characters on screen are ten-feet tall and blue would detract from the effectiveness of the performances, the personalities of the characters are in no way diminished or obscured.The film's main flaw is its length, which clocks in at two hours and forty minutes. Some of the initial freshness is lost by the end, which mostly consists of elaborate battle sequences. It is not that there are extraneous scenes, but instead, a more effective solution would be to pick up the pacing towards the end and trim, rather than cut entire scenes out. In addition, some have criticized the movie for not having an entirely unique story, and their comments are, to a point, valid since the basic plot is something we've seen many times before in movies like Dances with Wolves and The Last Samurai. Yet, somehow, all of this seems beside the point. One of Cameron's greatest strengths as a director has always been his ability to make movies that transcend clichés and that engage and entertain regardless of how often similar stories have been told.Nonetheless, while Avatar is not my favorite movie of 2009, it was certainly an engrossing and even enriching experience. By inventing a whole new world and populating it with realistic, fascinating inhabitants, James Cameron has taken full advantage of the capabilities of film-making, weaving together a story that is simultaneously moving, thrilling and enchanting. More than anything, Avatar is a reminder of the marvels and beauty of life, as well as the horror and devastation of war.",9,3,8,2 January 2010
The Artist," The stuff dreams are made of
","Like so many movies released in 2011, from Hugo and Midnight in Paris to Like Crazy and even Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, The Artist is about someone who clings to the past, who insists on lingering in some idealized Golden Age even though the rest of the world has moved on. When the movie's protagonist, the once-celebrated silent film star George Valentin first encounters the burgeoning phenomenon later known as 'talkies', he laughs in scornful defiance, believing with every fiber of his being that this is just a transient fad, nothing more; even when his studio ceases production on all silent films, essentially putting him out of a job, he refuses to accept the fact that he has become passé, that the audience that used to adore him has lost all interest, and starts to produce and direct his own movies. This fall-from-power storyline, made popular by such ancient Greek dramas as Oedipus Rex and Agamemnon, is hardly original, yet Michel Hazanavicious's The Artist lends it a new poignancy, for in our modern-day world of constant motion, Valentin's fate seems all too real.From the second it debuted at the Cannes Film Festival last May to apparently resounding applause, The Artist burst onto the scene as a prime Oscar contender. Critics lauded Hazanavicious for his clever ode to the era of silent film, and audiences fell in love with the charming characters (especially the beloved dog Uggie) and winning, feel-good story, which never loses its endearing vivacity, even when it strays down a surprisingly dark road. In short, the movie is almost impossible to dislike. From the moment the opening credits flicker on screen in delightful, old-fashioned black-and-white (a touch sure to induce nostalgia in anyone who has seen a movie made before the advent of Technicolor), it sweeps the audience back to a time when sincerity was admired, and the public still swooned unashamedly over the pure ingenuity of 'moving pictures'. The whole thing would feel gimmicky if it didn't feel so real, so heartfelt. For the first ten minutes or so, the mere novelty of it all is its own kind of magic, but then, it wears off, and you're no longer watching a 21st century silent, black-and-white film – you're simply watching a film, one filled with boundless energy and passion and emotion, one that's enchanting not because of its old-fashioned visual aesthetic but because it genuinely wants to tell a story, which sadly seems to be quite rare these days, when many filmmakers are content to clobber together a random series of set pieces and call that a 'plot', and even dramas are increasingly described as 'character studies' and 'explorations'. Needless to say, Hazanavicious pulls it off with seemingly effortless grace. With the help of an animated cast and a vibrant, suitably dramatic score courtesy of Ludovic Bource, he weaves a tale that is simple yet beguiling and, ultimately, heartbreaking, full of humor, drama, pathos, romance and suspense, along with an extra helping of panache.Speaking of the cast, it's no wonder Jean Dujardin, a French actor formerly known for the OSS 117 James Bond spoofs, has become a favorite to win the Oscar for Best Actor, a category that will probably include such Hollywood superstars as George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio. Blessed with a naturally expressive face and old-timey movie star looks, Dujardin is perfectly cast as Valentin, oozing charisma as he smiles and dances and intermittently raises his eyebrows, and even when Valentin plummets down a death spiral of depression and arrogant self-pity, he remains almost brutally likable; to say that it's easy to see why he was adored by movie audiences would be a glaring understatement. He also shares some nice chemistry with Bérénice Bejo, who plays up-and-coming actress Peppy Miller with infectious vigor, and despite never saying an audible word to each other, they make an exquisite couple, simultaneously sweet and believable. The rest of the main cast is rounded out by Penelope Ann Miller (Valentin's wife, Doris), James Cromwell (the butler, Clifton) and John Goodman (the director, Al Zimmer).But lest anyone get the wrong impression, The Artist is neither stuffy 'Oscar-bait' nor a cutesy indie; in fact, with its lighthearted, effervescent tone, it could not be more accessible or crowd-pleasing (though this will inevitably lead some critics and more hardcore film buffs to dismiss it as sentimental fluff). Also, although the marketing campaign has focused largely on the movie's attempt to replicate/pay tribute to classic Hollywood, its story and themes could not be more timeless or universal: while I can't say it's the overall best movie of 2011 (my personal favorite is J.J. Abrams's Super 8), The Artist does the best job of all the nostalgia-themed films released last year – and there were many – of depicting that intense sense of longing for a bygone era. For unlike most of the other movies, as good as some of them are, The Artist doesn't simply portray nostalgia as a wistful fantasy but also acknowledges that it is essentially rooted in stubbornness, a refusal to accept change that may not be idealistic so much as willful and irrational. And maybe that is ultimately what makes the movie special, what elevates it above sentimental fluff. For the very existence of The Artist, a 21st century silent film, as well as this recent trend of movies that romanticize the past, is proof that nostalgia is always relevant. It's a little sad to think that, even after all these years, we are still like George Valentin, struggling to revive silent films. Perhaps the real tragedy is not that the Golden Age is gone but that even today, we still miss it.",8,2,3,19 January 2012
Super 8," Take note, aspiring directors: this is passion
","I admit it: I am a huge fan of J.J. Abrams. Lost is my favorite TV show, I'm currently hooked on Fringe, and the 2009 reboot is pretty much my only knowledge of Star Trek. I adore the perfect blend of action and emotion and unabashed optimism he brings to his work, a style reminiscent of the great Steven Spielberg - he who popularized escapist summer blockbusters with such classics as Jaws and E.T. So when I heard that his new movie, Super 8, was not only a mysterious science-fiction thriller but also a tribute to Spielberg's early films, my expectations skyrocketed.Boy did Abrams deliver. Considering the vast amount of hype surrounding the movie since the enigmatic teaser debuted in theaters, anything less than THE feel-good summer movie of 2011 would have suggested failure. Yet somehow, not only was Super 8 everything I wanted it to be, it was more. Suspenseful, humorous and poignant, occasionally all at once, this is the kind of film that's impossible to describe to someone who hasn't experienced it, not because of any shocking plot twist but because its pleasures are rooted so deeply in the pure, irresistible emotions it inspires: delight, sadness, longing, fear, awe. It's like wandering through an exquisite dream – strange yet familiar, surreal yet authentic – and when the credits roll and you jolt back to reality, you feel as though you've left home. This is what the best movies do: sweep you off your feet and immerse you in a world you never want to leave.Something about prior experience always seems to bring out the best in directors. The majority of the media coverage that greeted the release of Super 8 focused on its cryptic marketing campaign and J.J. Abrams's past making amateur 8mm films and admiring the work of producer Steven Spielberg, and for the latter, it's not hard to see why. Each shot of Super 8, from its quietly moving opening scene to the breathtaking resolution, is infused with such palpable enthusiasm and soulful sincerity that viewers feel as though they're witnessing the director reach some personal catharsis. Part of what makes Super 8 so special is Abrams's obvious personal connection to its story, as his ardor and sympathy breathe life into a plot that could easily have been hackneyed and forgettable. Nonetheless, the movie never becomes self-indulgent or maudlin and displays a striking lack of pretension. Along with the drama and nostalgia comes a healthy dose of humor that assures the audience Abrams isn't taking himself too seriously; one senses that in essence, he is still that same eager cinema-obsessed kid. Also, Super 8 is in no way a rip-off of E.T. or Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Although maintaining some tropes from those films (i.e. benevolent alien, wistful view of childhood,) Super 8 is a distinctly J.J. Abrams creation. In fact, references are something of an Abrams trademark, as they feature prominently in both Lost and Fringe, and the rapport between Joe and his father mirrors the multifaceted parent-child relationships common throughout his work. Most of all, Super 8 showcases Abrams's characteristic hopefulness, a refreshing break from post-9/11 cynicism.Here, Abrams also continues a trend of pitch-perfect casting. None of the actors can be considered A-list, yet they provide such equally subtle, convincing performances that it is impossible to single out one person – the mark of a truly great ensemble. As Joe's father and the only adult with a significant amount of screen time, Kyle Chandler reveals why Friday Night Lights fans have championed him so fiercely: alternately self-assured and vulnerable, he has a remarkable ability to convey myriad emotions in a split second, often simultaneously. Even in his darker moments, he shows, through a flick of the eyes or inflection of the voice, that beneath the anger and grief, he is thoroughly, undeniably human. In less generous roles, Noah Emmerich (sinister yet never cartoonish) and Ron Eldard (heartbreaking) demonstrate similar tact. Still, it is the newcomers who form the movie's heart and soul. In his acting debut as shy protagonist Joe Lamb, 15 year old Joel Courtney is astounding, inhabiting his role with the poise of an actor twice his age. Amid an industry dominated by spoiled, too-clean child stars, he feels refreshingly down-to-earth, coming off as praiseworthy yet relatable, innocent yet flawed. Elle Fanning lends rebel Alice Dainard a nice balance of feminist resolve and quiet sensitivity, and Riley Griffiths has an endearing vivacity as Joe's best friend Charles, while Ryan Lee, Zach Mills and Gabriel Basso (Cary, Preston and Martin, respectively) provide ample support. Watching this group of up-and-coming actors, I can't help but feel a bit more hopeful for Hollywood's future.And this brings me to what should resonate most with audiences: the movie's spot-on portrait of childhood. Neither patronizing nor quixotic, Abrams's ode to the wonders of youth is among the most faithful I've ever seen, and his empathy for his juvenile protagonists is evident from the way he treats them not as precocious saints (one of cinema's most infuriating clichés) but as complex, well-rounded people who are capable of love, bitterness, despair, excitement and everything in between. Even when dealing with serious themes such as death, their dialogue is never less than credible. Look at their crude banter in the café scene or their panicked reactions to the train crash or Joe and Alice's casual exchange of complaints about Charles's domineering behavior. Abrams deftly avoids the typical (pre)teen angst formula, giving his characters depth rarely seen among on screen children, who tend to obsess over superficial issues like popularity and dating (there is a minor love triangle, but it stays true to the awkward naiveté of real child romances). Plus, bonus points for making nerds cool! Ultimately, Super 8 is like its director: smart, nostalgic and lighthearted, a comforting reminder of humanity's potential for goodness. This is why I fell in love with movies in the first place.",9,3,7,14 June 2011
Up," Pixar Does It Again!!!
","When I first saw the trailers for Up, I was skeptical. How interesting can it be to watch an old, cranky man and an impossibly optimistic, chubby kid float around in a house held in the air by balloons? As it turns out, it can be very interesting. The latest film from Pixar, the tenth in their roughly decade-and-a-half history of success, is, in parts, a comedy, an adventure, a buddy movie and a romance. Each genre is blended with the others to create a funny, entertaining and emotional story.One of the first things that helps make Up so compelling is the pitch-perfect voice casting, particularly of the two leads. As the movie's protagonist, Carl Fredrickson, Ed Asner is delightfully gloomy and cantankerous, delivering his lines with just the right balance of sarcasm and sincerity to make the audience genuinely care and root for a character that would be otherwise extremely unlikable. Newcomer Jordan Nagai provides his character, Russell, whose peppiness could easily have been irritating, with energy, enthusiasm and enough feeling to prevent Russell from becoming a caricature. Of course, a brief cameo by Pixar regular and 'lucky charm' John Ratzenberger, who is the only person to have been part of the cast of all ten Pixar feature films, as a construction worker doesn't hurt. Though he usually has minor parts, it would be very odd to see a Pixar film without him and his very distinctive voice.Even if it had not been available in 3-D, the visuals in Up would still be stunning. Vistas of a jungle and waterfalls act as an almost jaw-dropping backdrop without detracting from the story or characters. The attention to detail is phenomenal. Even though by now, computer-animation is considered the standard, one cannot help but be amazed at how realistic the film looks. Perhaps even more impressive is how Up uses 3-D technology to its advantage but never allows it to overwhelm the plot, relying on it to immerse the audience in the film instead of cheesy, pop-off-the-screen gags. The color palette, alternately bright and more neutral, really adds life to the film. In fact, the animation and visuals are so well-done that it seems as though Up would be just as entertaining if there was no sound at all, only images.But, of course, as great as the technology utilized in Up is, it's the story and characters that really engage the audience in a tender, emotional experience. What has distinguished Pixar movies from other animated films in the past is the way that it focuses on getting across a story worth telling instead of using the story as a vehicle to tell the jokes. Also, from Toy Story to Wall-E and Up, Pixar movies have appealed to both kids and adults. This appears to be the one of the only studios that realizes that animation is just another medium and that it can be used to tell grown-up stories with mature themes as well as tales that please kids. Though it has its share of laughs and jokes that will make people of any age crack up, the themes and messages that Up explores are decidedly serious. Unlike many recent animated films whose messages usually consist of 'Just be yourself' or some variation on that, Up focuses on death, loss and, ultimately, the importance of moving on and not letting grief keep you from realizing your dreams. In a world of cynicism and restlessness, its plea for people to recognize life as an adventure, that you don't have to travel to far-off places to experience excitement or grandeur, is especially relevant and crucial. Up is about ordinary people that do extraordinary things in equally extraordinary places before realizing that it is often the simple, boring things in life that bring the most joy.The only major flaw is the presence of a villain. Voiced by Christopher Plummer, Charles Muntz has little role to play than to provide an excuse for lengthy (albeit admittedly thrilling) action sequences. He feels unnecessary and in fact hurts the movie by forcing it into the typical villain-trying-to-kill-hero-for-no-real-reason formula. Though Muntz's canine sidekicks are colorful characters and sources of humor throughout, it seems as though the movie would have been better off without a central antagonist and instead used the relationship between the two protagonists as the main conflict. Knowing Pixar, they could have made Up just as entertaining and more innovative if the formula was ditched in favor of a more character-driven story about self-discovery.However, despite that flaw, Up was a thoroughly enjoyable and heartwarming movie with surprisingly likable characters. It had, not surprisingly, incredible animation that was used in support of a simple yet profound story and helped convey timeless messages of letting go and enjoying the ordinary and complex journey that is life.",8,1,2,31 May 2009
How to Train Your Dragon," 'Dragon' breathes a lot of smoke, but doesn't catch fire
","For a decade now, Dreamworks has had to carry the uncomfortable burden of playing second fiddle to that animation behemoth, Pixar. If this was a family, Disney's Pixar would be the older, ambitious sister, the one always doted upon and destined for greatness, and Dreamworks would be her cruder but sometimes more entertaining brother. However, the rivalry between the two studios seems to be fodder for the media more than anything else. Instead of stewing in jealousy or attempting to outdo Pixar, Dreamworks opts to stay true to itself and to fashion its own path to success; in fact, the studio could act as the protagonist in one of its own movies. With movies like the Shrek franchise, Madagascar and Monsters vs. Aliens, Dreamworks tends to aim for entertainment rather than art, simplicity over depth and the funny bone over the brain. For the most part, their latest film, How to Train Your Dragon, stays faithful to this trend.Strongly reminiscent of the 1999 movie The Iron Giant, Dragon employs Dreamworks's most reliable formula: that of the misfit underdog who ultimately gets his chance to shine and learns a valuable lesson along the way, usually on the lines of the ever-popular 'be yourself' mantra of most kids movies. Though The Iron Giant was superior overall, How to Train Your Dragon does possess a lot of the same earnestness and heart as that film. The scenes devoted to the emerging bond between Hiccup and Toothless are the best in the movie, and their relationship feels organic and natural instead of coming across as a corny plot device. Toothless in particular comes across almost immediately as likable and, in nature, resembles a puppy more than a ferocious dragon. In addition, the animation is very well-done throughout, and the flying scenes, especially one that recalls the 'A Whole New World' magic carpet ride in Disney's Aladdin, are as realistic as any. I didn't find them quite as engrossing as those in Avatar, but I'm sure they would have benefited had I caught this movie in time to see it in 3D.Still, even with those pluses, it is difficult to overlook the movie's flaws. The plot is predictably predictable, which would not have been quite so bad if the secondary characters had not been reduced to mere stereotypes (the disapproving father who only wants what's best for his son, the overachieving girl who eventually falls for the hero despite herself, the bullies, the comical friend/sidekick/confidant). While the usual pop culture references are thankfully absent and there are a handful of sharp lines, much of the humor and dialogue feels tired and wooden; the mostly lackluster voice cast does little to help. Furthermore, the movie strives to explore Viking and Norse mythology, but despite occasional shout-outs to Odin and Thor, this is all largely rendered moot by the presence of Scottish accents when they are obviously supposed to reside in Scandinavia.It's hard to really hate Dreamworks, though. After all, in terms of bug movies, I preferred Antz to A Bug's Life, and though I'm probably in a minority here, Kung Fu Panda was infinitely more enjoyable than Wall-E, which, for all its technical mastery, felt like an artsy message movie masquerading as something more accessible and less preachy. In spite of its faults, How to Train Your Dragon was a pleasant enough movie and certainly surpasses some of the other fare we've been subjected to thus far this year. It's no Toy Story 3, but it is something kids will probably love. Adults might not mind it much either.",7,3,7,21 July 2010
The Departed," A brilliant, engrossing crime drama
","'I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me.' So starts The Departed, one of this decade's finest movies. The above quote is spoken by Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), the ruthless, unpredictable leader of the Irish mob that terrorizes South Boston. He is the most wanted criminal by the Massachusetts State Police, a.k.a. the Staties. A young cop with a shady background named Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) has been recruited by Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Staff Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) to infiltrate Costello's ranks. Little do the police know that Costello has already inserted his own informant, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), into the police department.Even from the first two lines, the film manages to capture the audience's attention and hold it for over two-and-a-half hours. Armed with one of the wittiest, most unique scripts in years and an amazingly talented, A-list cast, director Martin Scorsese finally returns to what he does best: gritty noir-like films about the merciless, uncompromising world of organized crime. Filled with almost painfully realistic violence and more profanity than I ever thought possible, The Departed portrays the stresses and dangers of undercover life with pitch-perfect realism while managing to retain elements of touching and heartfelt drama. The characters are all well-developed and three-dimensional; even though they have their flaws, viewers come to really care about their triumphs and failures. Especially upon multiple viewings, it is possible to detect a sophistication and intricacy in The Departed that is absent in the majority of crime dramas. This is not a film for the sensitive or casual viewer and the intense plot of loyalty, betrayal and deceit has the complexity of a Shakespearean tragedy. In short, The Departed is a must-see film.",10,1,2,16 November 2008
Inception," Inception provides the kick of the summer
","When the credits began to roll, the audience groaned and then applauded. It was the opening night of Inception, the latest film from director Christopher Nolan and also the most anticipated movie of summer 2010. Expectations had been sky-high, and despite the excellence of Toy Story 3 and positive reviews for a number of other films, many had dubbed Inception as the picture that would 'save' the summer. As people headed out of the jam-packed theater, a buzz filled the air, an electricity of excitement that I had not sensed before. It was the sound of people who had just witnessed something special.The film opened with possibly the most confusing first twenty minutes I've ever seen. However, before I knew it, I was sucked into a world of intrigue, suspense and wonder. Describing Inception to those who have not yet seen it is nearly impossible: you have to see it to believe it.To communicate his vision to viewers, Nolan selected an all-star cast that had the heads of some cinema lovers spinning. As our main protagonist Dom Cobb, Leonardo DiCaprio portrays a man who uses poise and experience to disguise an underlying tumult of emotions and conflicting motivations. Using minute body gestures and subtle facial expressions, DiCaprio reveals Dom not as the leader we initially imagine him to be, but as someone tortured by memories and regret. Though DiCaprio gets the juiciest character arc with a role that could possibly earn him some awards buzz, he is backed by an ensemble of equally strong performers. Ellen Page proves that she can rise above and beyond a certain wise-cracking, pregnant teen, while indie favorite Joseph Gordon-Levitt breaks out with his first major role in a blockbuster, providing a voice of reason and occasional humor while committing regular acts of badassery. Continuing her effort to connect with mainstream America, Marion Cotillard succeeds brilliantly as Mal, Dom Cobb's mysterious wife, alternating between disturbing intesity and heartbreaking emotion; she makes a convincing sometimes-antagonist but we never doubt the relationship between her and DiCaprio. In addition, Ken Watanabe overcomes an occasionally muddled accent and, along with Cillian Murphy, makes the most of a significant though slightly less complex role. Finally, as Eames and Yusuf respectively, both Tom Hardy and Dileep Rao hold their own against their more well-known costars.Of course, as anyone who has seen the trailers can vouch for, one of the main draws of Inception was the visual effects. Jaw-dropping shots of cities folding in on themselves and men running on walls and ceilings teased audiences, promising more trippy effects should those people attend the actual movie. They did not disappoint; there were times during my screening where people audibly gasped. Technicians worked CGI in with the live-action so seamlessly that, even now, I can't tell which was which. Sets of decaying cities, a chic hotel and others exploded with detail and realism, while the cinematography gave the film a sleek, modern aura that perfectly fit the heist/thriller/sci-fi nature of the movie. Though there is no distinct, hummable melody, Hans Zimmer's score is outstanding, on par with the one he co-composed with James Newton Howard for The Dark Knight. It creates an atmosphere of tension that builds and multiplies through the entire film; it's noticeable without ever distracting from the film itself. The fact that, apparently, Zimmer composed it without seeing a single frame of the movie makes it all the more impressive. He also employs the French song 'Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien' to eerie effect. Not only is it sung by Edith Pilaf, whom Marion Cotillard portrayed to great acclaim in 2007, but it also emphasizes many of the themes within the film.None of this would have been possible, however, without the architects, director Christopher and writer Jonathan Nolan. Together, they build a reality with the imaginative scope of the greatest fantasy and sci-fi epics without sacrificing the emotional core of the film. They never forget that, no matter how lofty and ambitious the plot and ideas, no matter how mind-blowing the visuals are, no movie can succeed if it loses sight of the characters, of the human element. At the same time, they explore a concept that have enticed film-makers for generations: the nature of dreams and reality. They manage to explain the ideas within the story without ever slowing down the film. Instead of openly approaching issues raised by the illegal but seemingly commonplace occupation of extraction or 'dream-stealing', they leave those discussions to the viewers, keeping the attention on the characters and story; every scene is pivotal to one, or both, of those elements. In relation to their previous films, Inception takes the psychological twistiness of Memento and combines it with the more escapist entertainment that was the Batman films.Perhaps what makes Inception so extraordinary is, beyond the excellent craftsmanship behind it, the confidence it has in its audience. The film-makers, artists and other collaborators, even those behind the marketing and promotional campaign, refuse to accept the cynical myth so often regarded as truth that, especially of late, permeates the movie industry: that your present-day, average movie-goers are unable to recognize and reward good, intelligent film-making, that they enjoy only the familiar and commercial. Coupled with the box-office bang of Avatar (which I found captivating for the story and characters, in addition to the immersive, 3-D effects), Inception proves that movies can succeed without having a built-in fan base or a story based on previous material, that summer entertainment can be intelligent. It shows that originality is not a lost art in Hollywood, and audiences still appreciate smart, skillfully executed storytelling. Nolan and co. never condescend because they know and respect this. With Inception, Christopher Nolan keeps up his arguably perfect record, and after only a decade, proves that he just may be one of the best - if not the best - directors working today. He reminds us of the true power of film-making.",9,0,2,17 July 2010
X-Men: First Class," X-Men: First Class, Second Rate
","I'll admit that I'm probably not the best person to be reviewing this movie. I've never touched any of the comic books on which the X-Men franchise is based, and though I've seen all of the movies thus far, aside from the overt ridiculousness of 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine, I've come away from each of them with an overwhelming feeling of 'meh'.The premise is intriguing: superheroes – or mutants, as they are called here – are highly evolved humans whose extraordinary abilities and powers, instead of giving them the prototypical status as revered crime-fighters and saviors of mankind, alienate them from the rest of society. Their struggle to become accepted for who they are is used as an allegory for politically and socially relevant issues, most specifically, the gay rights movement. So, why does every movie seem vaguely disappointing, as though a great opportunity has been wasted? Is it just because I'm not part of the movie's target audience, which is pretty clearly those who are already familiar with the X-Men universe and mythology? Or have I simply set my standards too high, expected too much from movies that really just aim to be pure, cheeky fun? Don't get me wrong, X-Men: First Class has its moments, and as mindless summer escapism, it's not bad. There are thrills here and there, your usual bonanza of special effects, frenetic action sequences and eye candy, this time for both the guys and girls. A cameo by a certain beloved veteran of the franchise, along with an effective use of the one f-word allowed in a PG-13-rated movie, induced chuckles and a few whoops at my screening.The talent assembled is fairly impressive, with original X-Men helmer Bryan Singer finally returning, albeit in a producer-only role, and a number of recognizable names available to grace the marquee, though many of them, particularly Jennifer Lawrence in her first major blockbuster, go underused, their characters and story lines feeling almost like distractions or hurried afterthoughts. As a wheelchair-less, pre-hair loss version of Patrick Stewart's telekinetic Charles Xavier, James McAvoy spouts evenly-stated aphorisms and saintly benevolence, but it's Michael Fassbender who stands out as tortured soul Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto. With his Jude Law good looks and an appropriately steely gaze, he grounds a film that often seems overly caught up in its revisionist, self-empowerment ambitions and provides the movie with almost all of its best scenes, including a tavern-oriented confrontation reminiscent of something from Quentin Tarantion's Inglorious Basterds, which is also on Fassbender's rapidly expanding resume.In fact, beneath its glossy, very, very photogenic surface, X-Men: First Class looks oddly hollow. The use of the Cuban Missile Crisis as a major plot point fails to add any real weight to a story that is almost purposefully light and breezy. With the exception of Erik's past as the subject of Nazi experimentation, the backgrounds, relationships and motivations of the main characters are only thinly developed, and some events are either awkwardly structured or completely non sequitur; for example, there is a sex scene toward the latter half of the movie between Erik and Raven/Mystique (Lawrence's character), even though, prior to that moment, the two had barely exchanged a word, let alone any romantic chemistry. Furthermore, the movie often feels like merely a string of 'trailer-ready' moments with its endless stream of one-liners and deliberately posed action set pieces. Like in his previous effort, Kick Ass, director Matthew Vaughn seems more concerned with style than genuine substance, and a bombastic score by Henry Jackman irritates more often than it builds tension or atmosphere.In the end, though, it's not trying to be The Dark Knight. It provides two hours of solid, throwaway entertainment, and fans of the franchise as a whole will be pleased; they are already familiar with and invested in this world, so the dearth of character development will likely be less noticeable or problematic. And let's face it, when James McAvoy gazes at you from a 20-foot screen with those meltingly clear sky-blue eyes of his, it's hard to resist. I only wish the film-makers would stop settling for 'eh, it's good enough' and strive for X-traordinary.",7,1,5,12 June 2011
Toy Story 3," In their third feature film, Woody, Buzz and friends reach to infinity and beyond
","Pixar has done it again. Eleven years have passed since the first sequel to their 1995 classic hit theaters, but the Toy Story franchise has lost none of its magic or charm. In preparation for the third installment, I got cozy on my couch, popped the first two movies into the DVD player and found myself fully immersed once again in the world Woody, Buzz and their friends inhabit, the world that represents a distinct part in the childhood years of an entire generation. With top-notch animation (at least for that time), clever dialogue, stories that mixed humor, action and emotion and nuanced, likable characters, it's obvious why Toy Story became the beloved icon it is, transforming Pixar from a fledgling company into the most trusted, reliable studio in Hollywood in less than a decade. As a result, Toy Story 3 had big shoes to fill and any skepticism in the months and years preceding its release are certainly understandable, yet any doubts can now be thrown out the window: the film has met, and for some even surpassed, expectations.With a few exceptions (old friends like Bo Peep and Etch are missing this time around), the entire gang's back and after an engrossing opener that smartly hearkens back to an early scene in the first movie, it feels as though they've never left. In addition to the original cast, we're gradually introduced to a range of new characters: the insanely squishable Lots-o-Hugs Bear, voiced with sinister zest by Ned Beatty; Michael Keaton's Ken; a Lederhosen-attired hedgehog hilariously named Mr. Pricklepants; a more-than-slightly demented Baby; and other colorful individuals. While these new creatures are not quite as lovable as our old friends (in fact, many are downright menacing), they are still memorable and as fleshed-out as any live-action characters, and per usual, Pixar displays remarkable talent when it comes to voice-casting. Though there are many names that moviegoers will recognize, it is clear that all the actors were chosen because of how well they fit the role, not as a way of boosting the film's prestige - not that Pixar needs any of that.After features like Wall-E and Up, Pixar has shown a lot of fortitude in its effort to turn its films, and animated flicks in general, into something that adults can see without needing a kid in tow as an excuse. In fact, one could argue that its recent movies are ones for grown-ups that kids can nevertheless enjoy, rather than the other way around, and the third Toy Story does little to buck this trend. Though younger children will no doubt delight in the bright visuals and the jokes scattered throughout, this latest installment is largely empty of the verbal puns and quips that characterized its predecessors, focusing less on humor and more on the dramatic elements of the story. Tackling themes of loss, sacrifice and even death, Toy Story 3 is surprisingly dark. Sunnyside Day Care, the place the toys are donated to now that Andy is headed toward college, turns into a prison with Lotso as its oppressive, totalitarian warden, and one of the daycare residents - a prototypical monkey with cymbals - manages to be the creepiest chimp in recent cinema. Though this is not necessarily a flaw, it does result in an overall tone that differs greatly from Toy Story 1 and 2.Of course, you can't write a review of a Pixar film without mentioning the impeccable animation. The attention to detail is astounding, and though I was initially dubious, their decision to have Toy Story 3 in both 3D and IMAX pays off tremendously. Though the film will probably be successful regardless of the screen, only with one as big as an IMAX can you fully appreciate how truly incredible the visuals, which fill every inch of the screen with color and subtle touches, are. Even the 'Day and Night' short that preceded the main feature was jaw-dropping. What's more, though Pixar has always been a master of animation, the progress that they've made within the past fifteen years is astounding.Over the past decade and a half, John Lasseter and co. have become known simply as 'those geniuses at Pixar'. Though it is arguable whether or not their record is actually as spotless as many suggest (I personally didn't care for either A Bug's Life or Monster's Inc.), it is impossible to dispute their achievements. With gorgeous animation, sharp writing, flawless voice-casting and a cast of unforgettable characters, Toy Story 3 marks another high point in the studio's short but significant resume. Pixar has earned another gold star, and after a sluggish start that sent critics and studios into full-crisis mode, this summer has its first true hit.",9,2,3,20 June 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," The Boy Who Lived casts his final spell
","How do you review a movie that, for many in a certain generation - my generation - marks the end of an era, that represents the last chapter in a story that defined their childhood and youth? From the moment Harry Potter first stepped on the now-iconic Platform 9 3/4, his adventures became theirs; they laughed, cried and cheered with him, delighting in his world of magic, wonder and danger.A personal, emotional connection to the world and franchise of Harry Potter seems to have such an integral correlation to one's enjoyment of this movie that I feel obligated to lay out where I stand before diving head-first into my review. My love affair with Harry Potter, which lasted from book one to five, deteriorated with the sixth installment, one I still find to be self-indulgent and, frankly, rather unnecessary. The movies, while mostly enjoyable, have often felt more like rote adaptations than fully fleshed-out, living, breathing works in their own right.That said, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 is the best of the series. It doesn't approach the greatness of The Lord of the Rings, that fantasy saga to which all others are inevitably compared, but it's still a well-executed, satisfying conclusion.Credit must first be given to the producers and director David Yates. The Harry Potter series has become the most successful franchise in movie history, surpassing such legends as Bond and Star Wars, and the film-makers could have easily taken the lazy route, phoned it in without regard to quality (see: Twilight, or rather, don't). The money would've flooded in either way. Instead, Yates and his coworkers put genuine effort into producing films the series' fans deserved. They injected the Deathly Hallows, both Part 1 and 2, with artistry and passion that were often absent from previous movies. You can sense they'd finally, fully realized that 'bringing the books to life' means more than just following the words on the page; it means merging the author's vision with your own, being unafraid to add creative flourishes and, when necessary, changes.The movie begins on a rather rocky slope. Because this is a continuation of the previous film, we're immediately thrown into the thick of things, and there's no real opening to help the audience adjust. In fact, Deathly Hallows might work best if you watch the two parts back-to-back. However, once our heroes return to Hogwarts for the epic battle that fills the majority of run-time, the movie picks up and settles into a comfortable rhythm. To enrich the story's inherent action, suspense and drama, Yates utilizes all tools at his disposal: state-of-the-art special effects, painstakingly manufactured sets, smart usage of color and style in his cinematography. Though Alexandre Desplat's score sometimes veers into melodrama (John Williams is sorely missed, though his classic theme does pop up) and the aging process used for a 19-years-later epilogue is dubious, the technical elements largely come together with ease.However, what truly makes this movie work, the secret charm behind the franchise's success, is the cast. The love every actor, young or old, has for his or her character shines through. It's been a running joke that every veteran British actor worth his salt has appeared in at least one Harry Potter movie. While that isn't necessarily true, it's hard not to marvel at how many greats the series has attracted: Emma Thompson, Brendan Gleeson, Gary Oldman, Kenneth Branaugh, etc. Even more impressively, where many A-listers might've just sleepwalked their way to an easy paycheck, these actors treat their roles with the same care and devotion they would've given any Oscar-bait drama or Shakespearean play. Maggie Grace embodies Professor McGonagall's stately dignity, while Ralph Fiennes and Helena Bonham Carter bite into their parts with sadistic, scenery-chewing glee. Yet, no one stands out more than Alan Rickman, who has played Professor Severus Snape, always one of Rowling's most interesting and complex characters, for the past decade to oily perfection; occasionally, Rickman relishes the former potions professor's signature line delivery almost too much. Still, the tragic scene when Snape's motivations are finally explained is, for me at least, the best in the movie.But the films' stars have always been those portraying its three central protagonists: Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and Daniel Radcliffe. All I can say is, wow. What a joy it has been to watch them grow up and mature from baby-faced, bright-eyed kids who, according to original director Chris Columbus, could barely get through two lines of dialogue to intelligent, nuanced adults more than capable of holding their own beside their more experienced costars. That they did it all without encountering the woes that befall many of their peers is all the more remarkable. In this outing, Grint and Watson are significantly and unfortunately sidelined in favor of characters like Neville and Luna, neither of whom I ever cared for, but they make the most of what they have. Naturally, the spotlight falls most on Daniel Radcliffe. Of the three, he has had the most detractors, criticized as bland and wooden. That may, at one point, have been true, but here, he acquits himself admirably. Faced with the most challenging scenes he's ever been given as Harry Potter, Radcliffe dives in fearlessly and successfully brings out Harry's virtues, foibles and internal struggles.This movie has its flaws, most of which were also issues in the book and, if listed out, probably seem nitpicky on my part, but overall, it is a triumph. It may never receive the respect and accolades of awards giants, who still seem to regard the films as silly, kids' blockbuster trifles not worthy of their attention beyond a couple of tech nominations, but its cultural impact, not to mention the box office returns, is an, arguably, more valuable reward. To our three main stars, I wish all the luck, success and happiness in the world. They've earned it.",8,0,1,16 July 2011
The Social Network," An unlikely gem about an unlikely sensation
","When it was announced that Hollywood was going to make a movie about the founding of Facebook, no one, including me, expected it to succeed. How could anyone turn a seemingly mundane subject such as Internet communication into a worthwhile film? Moreover, why would anyone want to? It appeared to be nothing more than Hollywood trying to cash in on the latest cultural phenomenon, a move no less sleazy than, say, churning out endless sequels to a tired franchise. And yet David Fincher and his team managed to not only prevent The Social Network from becoming an embarrassing failure, but they transformed it into one of the most critically acclaimed movies of the year and a prime Oscar contender.How did they do it? With The Social Network, Columbia Pictures faced the particularly tricky task of promoting a movie that, despite its much-admired director and screenwriter, held little evident appeal to any audience, mainstream or indie. Nonetheless, with subtle efficiency, Columbia managed to assemble a clever advertising campaign that steadily garnered the film hype – a simple poster featuring star Jesse Eisenberg and a catchy tagline; a riveting theatrical trailer that highlighted the movie's dark sense of humor and explosive arguments – and ultimately, it was clear that this was not a high-budget thriller or a quirky comedy but an intelligent, character-driven drama aimed primarily at adults, an increasingly rare genre nowadays. The buzz turned into legitimate excitement once The Social Network premiered at the New York Film Festival to glowing reviews.Still, hype does not always translate to success (see: Changeling, The Lovely Bones). The Social Network fortunately escaped the fates of those early Oscar favorites-turned-critical duds, with help from the sure hands of director David Fincher, writer Aaron Sorkin and a cast of young, up-and-coming actors.Arguably the most impressive aspect of the movie and certainly the most likely to acquire awards attention, Aaron Sorkin's screenplay is a labyrinth of wit, suspense and twists, the dialogue zipping like balls in a pinball machine. Sorkin, most famous for penning 1992's A Few Good Men and the beloved TV show The West Wing, shows off his deft hand with legal issues, generating tension and excitement from the most mundane activities, such as people discussing copyright laws at a conference table, which absorbs a generous portion of the movie. By telling the story through flashbacks, he weaves a beguiling mosaic of conflicted voices and hidden motivations, an intricate web of lies and betrayal, rejecting black-and-white ideals in favor of moral ambiguity and flawed, even despicable characters. This is a screenplay any aspiring writer (myself included) would admire and envy.The cast, a truly impressive ensemble, delivers Sorkin's lines with deceptive ease, virtually disappearing into their respective characters, a feat most likely assisted by their collective anonymity. In a surprising yet inspired move, director David Fincher warned the actors against interacting with their real-life counterparts, as movie stars often do when portraying real people, discouraging them from doing impersonations instead of bona fide performances. Amid the universally solid supporting cast, Armie Hammer and Josh Pence stand out as Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, respectively, even though Pence was faceless and voiceless (employing technology similar that used in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Fincher superimposed Hammer's face on Pence's body in an effort to make the non-related actors appear identical).Nonetheless, it cannot be denied that the stars of the film – at least visibly – are its three male leads. By far the most well-known cast member, Justin Timberlake proves here for once and all that he has the talent needed to succeed in the film industry, that the promise shown in 2007's Alpha Dog was no fluke. As disgraced Napster co-founder Sean Parker, he exudes aplomb and charisma, the kind of brazen confidence one can expect only from a person well-acquainted with the world of celebrity and fame, and he manages to create sympathy – if only a little – for a vastly unlikable character by lending Parker a hint of childlike optimism along with the conceited swagger. In the most emotional role of the film, Andrew Garfield imbues Eduardo Sauverin with passion and drive, holding his own against his more well-known costars. Of the actors, he arguably has the best chance at nabbing awards attention as he gets a plethora of scenes to show off his budding talent.Personally, though, I was most astonished by Jesse Eisenberg, the fresh-faced lead whose previous movie credits include 2009's Adventureland and Zombieland. Here, it is obvious that he is more than 'another Michael Cera', playing Mark Zuckerberg as an arrogant yet socially awkward genius whose ambition and frustration override his central integrity. He remains, for the most part, emotionally detached, articulating Sorkin's lines with flawless deadpan acidity and relying largely on verbal nuances and body language to convey his character's feelings, yet he is so electric, so comfortable, that the audience has no trouble connecting to him. Possessing the maturity of actors twice his age, Eisenberg deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance.Lastly, one cannot overlook the efforts of David Fincher and his technical crew. Utilizing mostly dark and mute shades, Fincher gives The Social Network a bleak yet polished vibe with significant help from the gorgeously atmospheric score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, which swerves between melancholy and vivacious without difficulty. Also, editors Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall do an impeccable job of intertwining the past and present story lines.Against all odds, The Social Network has defied expectations and become a legitimate critical and box office hit. Skillfully assembled by a team of both veterans and amateurs and alive with humor and pathos, it is a film about friendship and rivalry, truth and fiction. The Social Network explores the fragility of human connections, the psychological barriers we erect to protect ourselves from each other.",9,0,0,9 October 2010
Valkyrie," A suspenseful and entertaining war thriller
","After hearing the negative reviews, I was a bit anxious about seeing Valkyrie. However, it turned out to be a pleasant and enjoyable movie with a great supporting cast, a solid script, top-notch direction and stunningly realistic visuals. Of course, the first thing everyone talks about is Tom Cruise. I actually thought he was very solid, and after the first five minutes or so, I really pretty much forgot that it was Tom Cruise and saw only saw Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg. It sounds impossible since he's so recognizable, but it happened. Unfortunately, most critics have written off his performance as 'distractingly bad,' and in my opinion, they are exaggerating a good deal; there is no doubt a lot of bias toward Cruise, and I suspect that many were already bashing his performance before even seeing the movie. I feel like this is rather unfair since a lot of critics have given the film itself negative reviews merely because they disliked his performance. The supporting cast also does a very good job, with special mention to Bill Nighy and Tom Wilkinson. Kenneth Branagh did a solid job considering he had surprisingly little screen time. Valkyrie is meant to be a thriller - and that is exactly what it is. The score, Bryan Singer's direction, visuals and decidedly bleak script contribute to the tension that carries throughout the movie. It is remarkable that Singer was able to keep up the fast paced suspense when we already know the ending. Speaking of the ending, this is a depressing movie and doesn't offer the glimmer of hope at the end that one might expect from a WWII movie. Valkyrie could easily have been turned into an Oscar-bait drama, but instead, it is clearly geared more toward the audience with the explosions, action and expansive vistas that are the stuff of adrenaline-pumping action movies. And there is no doubt that it looks fantastic. The visuals and costumes look absolutely authentic and might even garner the movie a couple Oscar nods.I also think that even though Valkyrie is presented more as a thriller than a war movie, it's interesting to learn about the story, which is relatively unknown to the general public, yet a momentous part of history. The movie does a good job of showing how far this small group of Germans was willing to go in order to save the country - and the continent - from total devastation.If you go into the theater looking for a decent, entertaining thriller with a great story, then Valkyrie won't disappoint.",7,2,4,3 January 2009
The Fighter," The Fighter: Beating the Odds
","Over the past decade, sports movies have, for better or worse, become virtually monopolized by Disney. Some, like Remember the Titans, Miracle and Cinderella Man (which is actually Universal/Miramax but follows in the same tradition as its Disney counterparts), are genuinely inspiring, but most feel like little more than rote exercises; you can sense the boxes being marked off: underdog protagonist, check; stern but motivating, has-been mentor, check; training montage, rising-toward-success montage, rousing speech or crowd cheering sequence during climax, check, check, check; throw in some sociopolitical issue to raise the stakes, just for good measure. It's as if they think audiences will forgive the clichéd mediocrity of the whole affair just because the words 'based on a true story' are written on the poster.The Fighter is not one of those movies. That isn't to say it doesn't follow the generic sports movie storyline, because for the most part, it does. There's the underdog protagonist, 'Irish' Micky Ward who starts the film off by telling everyone he's going to win a fight he ultimately loses so badly he's afraid to show his face for weeks; the mentor, his half-brother Dicky Eklund who coulda been a contendah before succumbing to crack cocaine addiction; the usual string of montages, though the everyone-rallies-around-the-hero scene is thankfully absent.And yet, something about David O. Russell's latest project feels fresh, very un-sports movie-ish. Maybe it's the way he ignores the clichés, rather than attempting to avoid them, acknowledging that they're inevitable because this is, after all, based on a true story, but never embracing them. There's no swelling music during the boxing scenes (in fact, aside from some choice rock/pop ditties scattered here and there, there isn't much of a score at all), and the grainy, documentary-like cinematography gives the proceedings a refreshingly authentic feel. Maybe it's the austere yet intimate script, which revels in the grit and grime of both Lowell, Massachusetts and the world of boxing without glorifying either, unflinching in its portrayal of the story's main players.According to most, it's the cast, which is, if not the outright best part, then certainly the most celebrated aspect of The Fighter. While promoting the movie, Mark Wahlberg made his love for the subject clear, describing the work he put into getting it made and why he stuck with it even as directors and prospective costars came and went. His passion and dedication comes through in his portrayal of Micky Ward, whom he turns into less of the earnest Everyman he played in 2006's Invincible, one of the aforementioned unremarkable entries in Disney's sports movie catalog, and more into someone who boxes as much for pure survival as for enjoyment of the sport. His central conflict is not whether or not he can win the next bout, though that is also important, but whether he can find personal success without abandoning his dysfunctional but ardently loyal family; we relate to and care about his struggle, and root for him because of that.Oddly enough, of the ensemble, Wahlberg is most likely to be overlooked by viewers. Melissa Leo and Amy Adams both take radically different turns from their most well-known roles, and to great effect. Melissa Leo's Alice, Micky's mother and manager, is bossy and domineering, the sort of woman who can turn men into whimpering puppies with one glance, but taking advantage of her few emotional moments, such as one where she and Dicky sing the Bee Gees's 'I Started a Joke', Leo humanizes her enough to prevent the Ward/Eklund matriarch from becoming a complete shrew. In comparison, Charlene initially seems demure, though we later learn she's not afraid of a fight (or a little booze). She holds her head up high because she went to college, but in truth, she's as much of a failure as any of the boorish patrons at the bar where she works. Amy Adams eschews stereotype for realism, glamour for raw honesty, and we believe her a hundred percent.The majority of attention will, no doubt, go to Christian Bale, who is guaranteed to pick up a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination, if not the win, for his work here. As Dicky Eklund, Bale delivers a performance that, while certainly demanding, seems light-hearted, almost comedic at times compared to what one might expect given the actor's propensity for intense, brooding roles. Though he physically transformed himself for the part, he wows us not by focusing on theatrical mannerisms or wallowing in melodrama the way most actors would have, but by revealing the person behind the addiction; he plays Dicky Eklund, not a drug addict. Because, in spite of everything, Eklund is one charismatic and goofy guy, and it's not hard to understand why he is still considered a local hero for beating - or 'beating', depending on who you ask - Sugar Ray Leonard in the late '70s, rather than a local disappointment for subsequently squandering his potential. When Dicky watches a documentary he claimed was about his 'comeback' but is instead about crack addiction with him as the main subject, honest-to-God tears sprang to my eyes; his moment of realization is almost painful to watch. What makes Christian Bale so great can be extended to the rest of the cast as well: they don't portray roles, they portray characters, people.In the end, it's a combination of all the above points that makes The Fighter work. More than anything else, it's a character-study of Micky and those involved in his search for a better life, even if that life lasts only a moment. In fact, the no-frills, relationship-centric approach arguably robs the climactic fight of a bit of its power considering that, by then, the dramatic conflicts have largely been resolved. Nonetheless, this is a great movie with strong performances, writing and direction that manages to breathe new life into a tired and trite genre. What were the odds?",8,3,4,19 December 2010
Up in the Air," 'Up in the Air' is grounded in humor, intelligence and pathos
","Amid the jumble of sequels, remakes and senseless blockbusters, Up in the Air, a witty, classy and lighthearted drama, feels like a breath of fresh air. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what makes this movie so great, but perhaps that's what's appealing about it - it simply has the right amount of everything. Without a doubt, Up in the Air is one of the year's best and most memorable films.Because Up in the Air is a character-driven film, it is important that the actors deliver and fortunately, they do. Perhaps it shouldn't be much of a surprise, since Jason Reitman, who directed and wrote the screenplay, apparently wrote all of the three major characters for their corresponding actors. As Ryan Bingham, George Clooney brings charisma, confusion and a certain amount of weariness. There is a hint of Danny Ocean-like suaveness to Ryan, as when he is giving motivational speeches or smoothly convincing a just-fired employee to look on the bright side, but he is nevertheless a person the audience can relate to; at some point, everyone feels the same sense of aimlessness that Bingham experiences, and this not only makes him sympathetic, but also heightens the film's emotional impact. Equally impressive are Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick, who play Bingham's love interest Alex and colleague Natalie, respectively. Both of them manage to make what could have been two-dimensional roles into characters that feel as real as anyone in real life; you can easily imagine passing them in the airport or seeing them sitting on the other side of your office. They also have great chemistry with Clooney: Ryan and Alex's romance sizzles, and the off-kilter, occasionally tense relationship between Bingham and Natalie is completely believable.Perhaps what gives the movie its extra oomph is the phenomenal script written by Jason Reitman. The dialogue is witty yet convincing and the story's various elements are perfectly balanced. It avoids the trap that many comedies or even light-hearted dramas fall into in the third act, which is the tendency to let heavy themes or sentimentality overwhelm the movie and extinguish any previous cheer. The theme of unemployment and economic uncertainty is played with, yet the film never takes it too seriously or too lightly, and up to the end, the characters are given the front stage; after all, the movie is not about the economy, but how the characters, especially Bingham, grow and how they deal with life's obstacles.All this is enhanced by Rolfe Kent's wistful, moving score and rest of the film's sensational soundtrack, which includes the song 'Up in the Air', written by Kevin Renick who sent his composition to Reitman after being fired from his job, making it all the more poignant.At its core, Up in the Air is about relationships: their burdens, the compromises required to maintain one and, most of all, that, without them, life would lose its purpose and meaning. It traces the way they ebb and flow and change over time, but also how they can remain constant, something to rely on in an increasingly uncertain world. As Ryan Bingham slowly discovers, no accomplishment is truly satisfying or enriching unless it is shared with another human being.The movie's atmosphere feels oddly novel, almost magical, and in many ways, it reminds me of Jerry Maguire. Though it has now become parodied multiple times, that 1996 movie still stands out as a romantic-comedy that truly warmed the heart in an era when few rom-coms manage to transcend the sappy or trite clichés of the genre. Like Jerry Maguire, Up in the Air relies on sharp writing and soulful performances in order to do what few films are able to achieve: they tell complex, engaging stories about people the audience wants to cheer for. We build a relationship with the characters and, through the highs and lows, we're with them all the way.",9,1,6,3 January 2010
