The Perks of Being a Wallflower," . Charlie (Logan Lerman), a 15-year-old freshman, has just joined high school where he copes with: being an outsider.
","'Di Perks ah Being ah Wallflower: Belizean Edition'If you were to lookup the definition of the word perfection in the dictionary it would say The Perks of Being a Wallflower. You laugh, hurt, cry and fall in love in one movie. Stephen Chbosky writer and director of the book and movie is truly extraordinary. If you were or still are part of the 'in crowd' this isn't the movie for you. Like Patrick (Ezra Miller) said 'You see things and you understand. You're a wallflower.' We all once thought we were outsider in high school. Chbosky wrote this thinking of the people at the fringes of what is mainstream. Unlike movies like Mean Girls, who focus on the popular, The Perks of Being a Wallflower focuses on the different. The awkwardness, the loneliness, and the unusual fellowship that accompany being on the outside looking in (Nutshell). Basically what high school really is about? Not the things they pretend it to be in the movie. Being a wallflower myself and being able to see people who also listen and understand made this my number one movie of all time. It's not only the narration that was spot on but the 90's music and the beautiful scenery of Pittsburg The book wasn't even necessary with how the movie was produced. Stephen basically used the book as the script. Anyone who has read the book and watched the movie can attest to how faithful they are to each other. Of course there were minor changes due to time but the heart of the book was present every step of the way. Not telling the entire movie as a letter did in a sense did defeat the idea of story but it by beginning and ending the movie with voice overs taken from the 'Dear Friend' letters written by Charlie (Logan Lerman), the movie was salvaged. For a first time watcher the flashbacks do confuse you but in a way add curiosity to what truly is the cause of Charlie's mental illness. The Perks of Being a Wallflower unfolds in a traditional, chronological fashion. As in the book, there are numerous cultural references. Charlie's English teacher, Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd), gives him a list of 'outside reading' options. The Rocky Horror Picture Show has a major role in Charlie's development in the course of making friends. And there's plenty of music from the '80s and early '90s. 'Come on Eileen' and David Bowie's 'Heroes' end up in the spotlight. Mr. Chbosky did a great job of translating a book into a film which is not an easy task. The musical score for the movie is to die for. It feels like someone turned back time to the 90's. The playlist emotionally resonates with the scene it is fitting. We can say that it was more of a mix tape than a soundtrack the way each some was in sync with the scene. One of the most memorable and my favorite is the tunnel scene when David Bowie's 'Heroes' songs plays and Sam's hair is in the wind while the camera is focused on her and blurred out the lights. Charlie's last words at the end of the ride were 'And in this moment I swear, we are infinite.' Such words after such a breathtaking scene seeps into the hearts of the audience making one truly feel infinite. This movie goes down as my favorite of all time. Whoever is a fan of the book will not be disappointed with the movie. If you're too lazy to read the book just watch the movie; you won't be disappointed. The movie is both intelligent and emotional about a part of our some of our lives which some of us still live by today. To all the wallflowers this movie is dedicated to you. To see that there are other that understand what you have been through. That you're not alone and to prove this a movie was made for all the wallflowers out there still simply listening and understanding.",10,0,1,15 February 2017
