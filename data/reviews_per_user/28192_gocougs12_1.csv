Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Exposed
","I have never seen any Borat shows prior to attending the movie nor did I speak with anyone who saw the movie. I found the film to be brilliant. It completely exposed this country for what it is...sexist, homophobic, racist, crawling with religious zealots,anti-semitic, and dripping with hubris. Cohen put a mirror up to our faces. Some did not like what they saw, others did not even understand the deeper meaning of the movie. Fear and ignorance are rampant in our culture, and Cohen shown a bright light on what weakens and divides us. Citizens around the globe will now see us for our true colors. Our politicians preach democracy. Our religious conservatives spew Jesus' love as they hold up 'God Hates Fags' signs. We are a country which is dangerously influenced by bigots and hypocrites. The facade has crumbled thanks to Cohen!",10,1,12,2 January 2007
