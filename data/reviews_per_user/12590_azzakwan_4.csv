Your Name.," I expect more but how did it get the hight grossing anime movie???
","Not as magical as hayao miyazaki's other masterpieces.It's just an animated, scifi & romcom version of j-drama I'd a say. I used to be a j-drama fan but people move on to k-dramas which makes better tv series & also films compare to japan nowadays.1 thing I'm impressed of the hero or typical japan hero's journey, they'd do anything against all odds to achieve the goals for the loved ones. Like the tragic death of lalaru from anime 'now and then, here and there' after shu trying so hard to save her. This movie did the same & the hero rewrites history, luckily the boy in the girl's body didn't cry wolf to save them all. It's kind of weird nobody heard of the town hit by the asteroid #plottwistWhy i watched this movie? I was single & longed for ala j-drama love story.Why i kinda hate it? I was in japan, not as fun as watching j-drama & that time neighbors next to a bnb i booked wasn't available, the old guy said 'i cannot understand English'. The ending like spirited away's ending the dragon kid, haku... What became of of the haku??? Now this movie, taki & mitsuha??? They finally got to meet face-to-face (happily ever after) & it's up to us to make up their next story?????Why i kinda like it? I don't want to end up in a tragic death by asteroid, proposed the girl I've had known for 13 years.",7,1,2,5 April 2019
Captain Marvel," Not marvellous at all
","Looking at the all-time worldwide at boxofficemojo, marvel or disney is the apple of the industry. Whatever they sell will sold out. Didn't expect the remake of live beauty action beauty & the beast made billionI feel sorry for battle angel alita, the adrenaline watching marvel can't surpass alita.Disney's current fashion trend is turning the bad guys into good guys, look at maleficent!I still don't get it before this they said Scarlett witch is the strongest avenger, now it's captain marvel. What about thor & hulk? Thanos took hulk down easily in infinity war. What would happen to captain marvel when rogue from x men becomes MCU?She doesn't seem tough like the animated avengers assemble. I hope to see her tougher side in endgame or any sequel.Alas, go watch battle angel alita or disney should market this movie now disney's 20th century fox.... Please fix predator & alien franchise (make it r rated too)",6,2,2,31 March 2019
Cloverfield," Go watch the host/gwoemul (2006)
","I really don't understand the motive, the devotion, the problem of monster attacking america. (Yeah, we all know on news all the invasions including the failure in vietnam & now iran.)Why the host? We all need to watch not so rich, moderate, broke, everyday nobody people doing something extraordinary to save a family no matter the odds.",3,0,0,2 February 2020
Avengers: Endgame," thanos conquers many places but fails at earth
","Epic battle, just like any sentai tv series or kamen riders where they all come together to help. out of many, wakanda help them and not much help from america.
this movie serves as captain america 4 & bucky did spoiled early on even before infinity war came out of what captain america going to do to falcon.
the previous thanos is smarter and stronger than infinity war thanos, he killed many and conquers planets but earth is no match for him. all thanks to infinity gauntlet.
this movie has been contaminated by too much rick and morty's elements! you people just can't make a decent time travel movie like back to the future!now russos, go make me 'community' movie.",5,0,2,25 April 2019
