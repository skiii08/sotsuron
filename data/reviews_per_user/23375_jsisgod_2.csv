Antz," This is a good movie!
","I was one of many students who watched the videotape of 'Antz' in Ms. Caracello's senior government class (what the hell does this have to do with government anyway?) and I actually enjoyed it! Probably one of the better films she has subjected the class to in a long time. For those who have not seen it, you're in for a treat. Antz is chalk full of comedy, terrific one-liners, and other subtle humor. The animation is semi-descent, flawless for the most part. The voices are also great. I loved Gene Hackman's portrayal of the evil leader, as well as Christopher Walken's portrayal of one of Hackman's foot soldiers. Although this is a somewhat predictable story, it does have its highlights, the 'Insectopia' sub plot for example. Antz is probably more suitable for adults rather than kids. All together, this is a great film.",Null,0,0,28 February 2000
Ghostbusters," Perhaps the greatest in screen history....
","I originally saw this movie when it was released to video in 1984 (didn't catch it in theaters though), and have loved it ever since. As a kid, I had all the Ghostbusters toys, played the Nintendo game, ate the cereal, I lived and breathed Ghostbusters. Of course, I've grown up since then, but I still enjoy the film to this day. Whenever I stay home sick from school, I watch it. It's tradition!Perhaps one of the greatest things about GB, is the fact that it remains funny after so many years. The film makers did something so many others have never been able to do; they made a film that is timeless. Ghostbusters has withstood the eighties, the nineties, and I expect it will remain popular for years to come.Another great thing about this film, is that it has something for all ages. As a kid, I loved the special effects, and the in your face humor. Years later as a teenager, I still find it enjoyable. So many funny lines I missed as a youngster have suddenly become apparent. It seems as though I discover something new each time I watch it.In closing, I recommend this movie to anyone. If you didn't like it, well, you're a dip. This is a true classic I will always remember.",Null,0,0,20 February 2000
