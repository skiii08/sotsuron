Come and See," Rough Film
","Elem Klimov's Come and See is one of the most horrific, unbearable movies you will ever see. It documents the World War 2 invasion of German forces into Byelorussia through the eyes of young Florya, Aleksey Kravchako. The film is completely effective at bringing us into his world and experiencing all the innumerable atrocities of war through his young eyes. You actually at times feel you are right along with him, in his shoes, aghast at the inexplicable displays of humanity at their absolute worst. It is unrelenting from start to finish. I am not a fan of war movies and this is undoubtedly the most intense, horrific and memorable war movie you will ever see. So, if you enjoy a incredibly realistic account of war that is accurately and brutally depicted, watch Come and See.",Null,1,1,13 December 2010
