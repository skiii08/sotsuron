Requiem for a Dream," An interesting project that disappears up its creative arse
","Don't get me wrong! Darren Aronofsky is a talented man. I adored The Wrestler and admired the squandered philosophising of The Fountain but this film, which was also my first contact with Aronofsky, is a train wreck.It's a film that I can best describe as the cinematic equivalent to losing your soul. While some of the performances are admirable (particularly Ellen Burstyn and Marlon Wayans, who I had previously written off as the most untalented man in Hollywood) and some of the technical flourishes Aronofsky employs are impressive the problem is that there's too much flashing before your eyes to care about the characters.One scene stays in my mind that I can't help but admire. A simple quiet scene between Mother and Son, with Aronofsky actually letting his cast do something that resembles a dramatic scene, but either side of it are just 100 minutes of untrained focus. Nothing is really given any weight or rather the weight of the message is diluted by technical trickery.Watch Trainspotting instead with characters you care about, a story that is by turns tragic and equally hilarious, a brilliant script and performances that undeniably unique.This is the US cutting-edge version of Danny Boyle's film - and guess what - its dull and ultimately depressing.",3,2,3,20 July 2009
Oldboy," Is this the greatest film Tarantino never made?
","No doubt about it, OldBoy is all about extremity. You want torture? Try getting your head around the idea of being in solitary for 15 years or the new dental work courtesy of a hammer. Violence? Check out the one-take corridor brawl in which psychologically ravaged Dae-su takes on a score of goons... with a claw-hammer.You want to know how far someone could go to wreak revenge? Well, we advise you to brave South Korean writer-director Park Chan-wook's helter-skelter descent into the dingiest pit of human behaviour, even if at times it is tough going and ludicriously unfeasible.As a sequel to the first in Park's 'Vengance' trilogy. We are greeted by a reality drenched in atmosphere and the grotesque. Like Se7en but we see the murders this time round. The live octopus scene and torture by hammer are without a doubt the most horrific moments. But there's plenty else to shock even without them - and all done with such unabashed verve that you'll be as compelled as you are repulsed.OldBoy recalls Fincher in its CG-assisted flourishes and doom ridden themes, and Tarantino with its sharp-suited, stylised bloodletting. But it's unlikely either of those guys would ever be allowed to push it as far as Park has with this. Not to everyone's tastes, but if you have a strong stomach, OldBoy is sure to impress.Like I said, the word is extreme...",9,12,77,12 May 2006
Knocked Up," Knocked Out of the Ball Park?
","Forgive the rather redundant pun. The end of the day what I should try and summarise quickly is that this comedy is actually funny. Considering that my view of romantic comedies is that they tend to play for the safe laughs and an expected happy ending. Knocked Up does not do that.The premise itself is rather risqué when painted as a romantic comedy (which this film is over the gross out comedy more often associated American Pie or Apatow's other work The 40 Year Old Virgin) as essentially a slacker impregnates a beautiful, though equally clueless, woman.Overlooked completely are the leads in this movie. While Rogen gets most of the laughs (and deservedly so) it is Heigl who gives the best performance. Her breakdown in the clinic is completely believable and brings a tear to even the most unemotional human being. Equal applause should go to Leslie Mann (Apatow's real life wife) who despite being essentially the nemesis of the piece gives just as important a performance as a woman trapped in a souring marriage. Paul Rudd is the only of the four leads who isn't given enough to really shine. Hilarious in Anchorman and Apatow's earlier piece here he feels like an add-on to the main cast.Nevertheless the film is brilliantly written and superbly performed by everyone. The highlights are undoubtedly the beard jokes ('your face looks like Robin Williams' knuckles) and Harold Ramis' Alzheimers skit. All the while remember that the two leads are actually have a lot of the same neuroses and fears as anyone in a relationship and that is perhaps the film's strongest point that despite the aesthetic differences between the pair. Ben actually makes Alison happy after initial teething's and that perhaps is the strongest suit of the film that the pair are completely believable despite the inevitable smutty jokes. It is well observed and masterfully executed.See this film!",8,2,4,21 February 2008
The Thing," One of the greatest and most layered horror films of all times
","Maybe it was the timing. With AIDS rearing its head in eighties culture, the Cold War essentially having everyone fearing the end of the world but John Carpenter's The Thing just has that special something about it.Considering today's horror films are almost entirely remakes (something The Thing has had written about it for several years now) this feels original despite already being a remake in itself. There hasn't really been anything else like it before or since, unlike films such as The Exorcist or The Omen that have found their premise inferiorly mimicked countless times now.The premise is simple. Nine men are stranded in Antarctica - and something is taking over their bodies. Carpenter racks up the tension early on creating the sense within the first half hour that the entire cast could already be infected and never gives you any suggestion they are infected until the reveal. It's that sense of unknowing as an audience member that gives The Thing one of its finest strengths.Performance wise the cast are universally strong, never dissolving into horror clichÃ©s to ensure that this isn't just Kurt Russell's show nor is it just another hackneyed remake. Ennio Morricone's minimalist score only helps to heighten the tension around every scene.The real hero of the film, and its strongest suit, is make-up guru Rob Bottin creating creatures that are undeniably taken from the audience subconscious. Every time the creature is revealed in its grotesque form there's a sense that the stuff of nightmares is really well and truly out to get these people and the audience. While many horror films (including many of Carpenter's own works) deal in the unseen The Thing itself is always seen and its terrifying.The fact that the ending ends on such a note of uncertainty is all the more chilling leaving the audience wanting a conclusion that they will never get. It's that sense of unease that never leaves you. The Thing is about a lot more than just scaring its audience. It leaves you thinking. It leaves you wanting more. It leaves you in a state of unease. But then again, The Thing never really leaves you.To put it simply, utter genius",10,1,2,21 July 2009
Patton," If this wasn't a true story you wouldn't believe a character like Patton exists
","Before Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down there was a Patton. A serious film dealing with the psychology of the soldier that against the films of the time, that were no more than glorified exploitation pictures better known as Men-on-a-Mission pictures, seems almost revolutionary.George C. Scott famously turned down his Oscar when he won for his portrayal of General Patton and it seems somewhat poignant that Scott seems to have carried across some of Patton's noble intentions. Actors, like soldiers, do a job and if they do it well most do so without attention or fuss. Only a select few are remembered.Patton is essentially a multi-million dollar character study. It is about a man whose sole purpose is war and the intellect and ingenuity he displays while at it is remarkable. Yet to take him away from the horrors of war and he is useless. A lot of the film takes place away from the battlefield. Instead Patton is trapped in London hotel rooms sitting dutifully by the phone but utterly destroyed as his purpose in life is no longer appropriate. Patton may not be instantly likable - his attitude to cowardice is clearly incredibly vile but it is undermined by the humanism he displays for those who have been wounded or crippled in battle for their country.Intrigingly Patton fights for a country and administration that are embarrassed by him. He is clearly intelligent and resourceful but to put the man in a domestic situation neuters him and Scott carries himself wonderfully throughout whether spewing angered rhetoric at his superiors or staring contemptibly at himself. He is almost a rebel except one that fights for the system yet feels free to tear it up from the inside.Karl Malden is definitely a presence that is really missed when not on screen. That stoic everyman quality is fantastic next to Scott's exuberant performance. The direction is strong and while the film is over three hours long its length is not that noticeable until you are well into the third hour of the film.It suffers from a few too many scenes of the same thing (Patton appears to whine a lot and shout a lot) but rather amazingly it works. It does not feel overblown like other historical epics such as say, Ben Hur or Cleopatra, nor is it an overly pretentious war film such as later works like The Thin Red Line. Instead it presents the epic scope of war against the intimate. There are more scenes in confined rooms than battlefields.In a decade when cinema was supposedly changed this film got there before the tent-pole films of the decade in spending a lot of money on what is actually an intimate, personal, layered story. Before The Godfather, Apocalypse Now, Jaws, Close Encounters or Alien there was Patton. And while it isn't quite as good as the films just listed. It is however still a great film that deserves your attention. On top of all this character study it is also just really entertaining. Watch it for the good film it is, even if it isn't quite a great as many of the other films that littered the ensuing decade.",8,0,1,21 August 2009
The Dark Knight," Flawed but near perfect
","This film has been compared to greatest works of art on our earth today. Let's not get ahead of ourselves The Dark Knight is still just a movie and a blockbuster at that! It is hardly a film of the same cultural impact as say, Apocalypse Now or Pulp Fiction. This is still big audience entertainment but what perhaps makes this film better than the reams of summer blockbusters (a lot of which are now comic book films) is that it is not a family summer film.Far from it in fact. This is of course down to the presence of Heath Ledger and Director Christopher Nolan (who I pray becomes a messiah of cinema following this film). With Ledger creating the most brutal psycho since Hannibal Lector, in the same year as Anton Chirugh and Daniel Plainview no less, there is no way that this film's Joker can appease children in the same way recent Batman films have, Begins excluded. The performance is one that does just dominate the entire film but leaves you chilled afterwards. As a final completed performance Heath Ledger has left this world an icon. The terror every frame he is in permeates throughout those he is absent from.Nolan however is the real genius of the film for without him there would never have been Heath Ledger in this film to begin or a Joker quite as dark and terrifying. Despite fantastic action sequences he has made this film undeniably a character piece and a portrait of city. The scenes showing both criminals and citizens deciding each other's fate is as powerful a scene as any with the Joker in it. While Gotham is indeed fictional the corruption that consumes it is all too apparent in the modern world most notably in the America we are shown in shows like The Wire, The Sopranos and Deadwood (an allegory for the modern world if you will). Nolan's greatest achievement is taking a blockbuster and making it both entertaining and beautiful. Immediately relevant and timeless in the years to come.The actors who have been forgotten in Ledger's wake are the equally brilliant but more subtly played Gary Oldman and Aaron Eckhart (arguably the second best performance in this film). Both are men who uphold the law but struggle to do so in a world where everyone around them is for sale while Batman does so without issue.Many have criticised Batman not being at the centre of this film, which is true. Christian Bale is now behind the mask far more than he is Bruce Wayne but that is not the issue. Batman Begins was about Bruce Wayne becoming Batman. The Dark Knight is about Batman trying to maintain a world with Bruce Wayne still in it. In making this film about Gotham the film is undeniably about Harvey Dent and its his story that has the most impact as it plays like a Greek tragedy, and Nolan does it so poetically. The film has been compared to Heat a lot already but a distinction that needs to be made is with Fincher's Se7en. In that film its ending took time to appreciate how anti-Hollywood it was. The Dark Knight has a similar impact but is undeniably as powerful.The film is still a blockbuster but nothing has been seen like this since Jaws invented the term, and that film had a child die on screen. Imagine a comic film where the hero breaks a villain's legs. That is what this film has. Hopefully it has made a bigger impact on movies because if more films are like this then Hollywood is entering a new golden age. We just might have to wait a while to see its effects. I cannot wait.",9,3,10,10 September 2008
Mystic River," Not as easy a watch as one would think
","I first saw Mystic River in 2003. I hated it. I found Sean Penn to be incredibly over the top and self congratulating in his performance (something I still think he is guilty of in almost every film I have seen of his) and the story was sinister high hokum.Now six years on return to the scene of the crime and find myself about turned. I was fourteen, or thereabouts, when I first saw Mystic River. I was yet to really learn the distinction between actors and superstars, and I thought that the film was a whodunit thriller entirely commonplace of Hollywood.It's not.As I said for my summary it is naive to watch this film thinking that it is about finding a killer. It most certainly isn't. It is a film about friendship, time and loyalty. The film makes way for female characters whom despite their domestic roles within the drama are entirely as important as the male ones in helping us to understand not just the characters, but the nature of the city the story is about. It is well acted for the most part and I found myself loving Sean Penn's performance, a rarity for me. It is rare that a film of this sort can turn the victim into the villain without it seeming like high hokum. Penn achieves this admirably, and while I still wish Bill Murray had won the 2003 Best Actor Oscar I am less enraged than I once was at his snub. Penn is certainly the second most deserving man of that year.Furthermore, the film is immersive in the detail of Boston as much as it is in us understanding how time changes friendship and family loyalties. Kevin Bacon superbly handles this. It is his now-outsider to the home he grew up in that emphasises the significance of the passage of time and how little childhood memories really affect the future.There are still problems with the film. Tim Robbins' performance just feels misplaced. Undeniably the most important character of the story somehow Robbins part on page and on screen don't feel fleshed out enough. There is so much more to this character than the film allows. His Oscar win was an undeserved one. Seek out Ken Watanabe's performance in The Last Samurai to see the true supporting performance of that year.Mystic River is a deeper, slower and more moving one than its placing within the thriller genre suggests. It is not as pacey as say Gone Baby Gone, another Lehane adaptation, nor as suspenseful as much of Eastwood's other work. But I do stand corrected.Mystic River is a very good, albeit flawed, film. See it and be rewarded, but be patient with it or you'll find yourself hating it for all the wrong reasons.",7,1,1,24 May 2009
Moon," It deserves to be seen although maybe not praised just yet
","2009 has been a fairly awful year for cinema. Moon stands out in a year when six months prior nothing has excited an audience member who has a problem watching sexist, machismo driven blockbuster drivel. It is hardly an exceptional film. It does not homage so much as copy many of the great science fiction films of cinema. 2001, Silent Running and Alien are all clearly on screen. The threatening artificial intelligence of the onboard computer, the day-to-day environment threatened by corporate orders, the claustrophobic setting. Unlike Danny Boyle's Sunshine which seems eerie even before any of the peril sets in, Moon takes a long time to really go anywhere interesting.That is neither the fault of Sam Rockwell or Duncan Jones' direction, which are both impressive and suggest greater things beckon for both, particularly Jones who seems unable to have an uninteresting image on screen. The script which spends a long time enforcing the monotony of Sam Bell's day-to-day activities and once its slow pace, that served Alien so well, is broken by incident it forces the audience to pay attention again and much is lost. It requires a second viewing not simply because a lot is lost in a first viewing but to simply help the audience understand what they missed when dozing.That said it is a science fiction with ideas aplenty about identity and man's place in the world and given other science fiction films this year that are entirely about spectacle it is refreshing to see something with brains.Clint Mansell's score however is utterly brilliant. Haunting and ethereal it is instantly a classic and makes the final scenes of Moon all the more memorable and moving. Whatever Duncan Jones does next will be certainly worth watching and will be more interesting than every other film of the summer, unless Christopher Nolan has a film out. This is the beginning of Duncan Jones' career and it cements Rockwell's reputation as a sterling actor who demands more zeroes to his pay cheques. But they have a long to go Moon is only the beginning. They still have a long way to go. Jones isn't Kubrick yet, nor is he Ridley Scott. But he can only go up...or so I hope.",8,0,2,21 August 2009
