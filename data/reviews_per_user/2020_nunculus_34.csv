Ali," Last of the control-fricans
","Actors are fond of telling the press about the care Michael Mann takes in plucking an unruly hair from their head, or arranging the tiniest flowers in an arrangement on the far edge of the frame. If they gave out Oscars for tending to the trees and ignoring the forest, Mann would have his arms full. Trying to shed his Antonioni-derived, interior decorator's style, Mann shoots in digital video, gobbles on lens flares, blows out the background, lets frame-filling faces go soft. He tries to make a mess of the life of Muhammad Ali. But what one comes away with is a strict attention to haircuts, an autistic fix on lapel widths, a lascivious ogling at ashtrays and hood ornaments and Wilson Pickett-like sound cues. And a great deal of untended-to nervousness on the part of Will Smith.What was Mann thinking casting Smith--except that Smith was the only guy who could get a $100,000,000 movie about Muhammad Ali greenlit? When the fresh prince stands next to Jeffrey Wright (who plays...I'm not sure what), all you notice is how startlingly much Wright resembles Muhammad Ali. (No doubt Wright thought about this, too--a lot.) The picture gets some drama going in its second half, when Ali refuses to be drafted and loses his boxing license and his membership in the Nation of Islam. But what gives Ali the force of his convictions, yet lets him crumble repeatedly (as when he lets a corrupt Nation of Islam manager back into his lif after losing his life savings to him)? The movie narrates rather than inquires. And Mann devotes so much energy to getting the trimmings right, like turning Jon Voight into a nearly animatronic facsimile of Howard Cosell, that Ali's inner life goes utterly neglected.Mann and his co-scenarist, Eric Roth, spent time working out what Ali means historically; if the movie is about anything, it's about Ali's status as an icon of black self-respect. But where's the beauty and the humor of the man? Ali was an entertainer who teased and delighted with the brashness and arrogance of his self-regard. He invited the world to join in his adoration of the wonder that was himself. Mann and Roth take a stab at depicting Ali the master of the quick comeback and the ad-libbed remark...but it's not much of a stab. And if Mann wanted to make Ali an unknowable existential hero in his usual fashion, he really picked the wrong actor. Smith comes across as an eager-to-please, well-to-do young man working very hard at playing someone he seems not to understand. He's good at playing the Ali who can work up a roomful of jaded reporters into a comic froth, but when Ali is meant to be soulsick Smith registers nothing. He's weightless.ALI represents some kind of herculean effort on Mann's (and a lot of other people's) part, but it feels oddly unambitious. Wasn't Mann the least bit afraid of walking in the shadow of the RAGING BULL boxing scenes? Visually, the movie is much less distinctive than Mann's relatively straightforward THE INSIDER. Mann has one undeniable gift: turning what could be prosaic, journalistic moments into sleepy, in-and-out dreamscapes--accomplished mostly through the use of trancelike New Age music. But that opium vapor that seemed so apropos to the world of MIAMI VICE--what the hell does it have to do with Muhammad Ali? The canvas of ALI is too big for this assiduous minimalist. The movie makes you appreciate the biographical points of view, however nutty or incomplete, of Spike Lee and Oliver Stone.",Null,0,1,28 December 2001
Erin Brockovich," Soderbergh...the Cukor of the Aughts?
","You can't quite always be sure. Is Steven Soderbergh giving us the most radical upending of a female movie star since Godard's TOUT VA BIEN? Or is he just a poor lackey locked under the jail, forced to photograph scenes in which Big Star Julia tells off rich snooty lawyers in glamourous closeups? Whichever--I guess he's both--he's the guy who took what could have been a routine chick-flick script and made it into a nineties ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE.Soderbergh--fast becoming one of our finest directors--is all about the fringes. He's all about the perfect telling throwaway set decoration, the little improv'd moment a kid has that falls away at the end of a scene, the handheld moment that just goes soft a little bit. And it's the fringes that put this movie over, not the rah-rah script by Susannah Grant. (In one scene, Erin Brockovich demonstrates that she has the phone numbers of six hundred plaintiffs committed to memory. 'You want their diseases, too, Theresa?' Grant sometimes thinks she's doing a rewrite on SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT.) It's the Little People that Julia runs into--like Tracey Walter, as a guy who isn't what he seems. It's about the way the DP, the great Ed Lachman, makes everything feel so offhand, so yeah-whatever, and yet so very beautiful.The producers--Danny DeVito and company--had a smart idea. It takes a Soderbergh to put a movie like this over the top--somebody who'll pull it down into the niceties of lived life, not a Joel Schumacher slickster who'd polish it up to the level of a Grisham movie. And the big payoff is that Julia Roberts gives a performance that's equally movie-star-like and conscientious about keeping it real. She is great at what she does. It's great to see growth in an overpaid movie star. From here on out, the sky's the limit--as, I hope, it shall be for that most modest yet most ingenious and fiendishly inventive of talents, Steven Soderbergh.",Null,1,1,25 March 2000
Unbreakable," Go on, fill in the blank. Unbearable. Unwatchable. Un...
","Some pop-culture mysteries I can get. I get Britney Spears. I get, in a cerebral way, 'Survivor' and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. I even get, in a more detached way, 'The Bridges of Madison County' or 'The Celestine Prophecies.' What I don't get, is M. Night Shyamalan. Shyamalan's two blockbusters, SIXTH SENSE and this ten-ton doozy, are like student-film clunkers stretched out and made as heavy as the late works of Stanley Kubrick. But where Kubrick, pre-EYES WIDE SHUT, used the lugubriousness of his filmmaking to create a sense of everlasting mystery, of standing above an abyss, Shyamalan uses portentousness to make routine studio-movie writing seem weighty--'spiritual.' In THE SIXTH SENSE, Shyamalan took an eternity to tell us the obvious--! Here, he lets on fairly early that his everyman hero (Bruce Willis) is some sort of superhero or god--but then what? As Shyamalan pads towards his trademark Whammy Ending, the actors stare at one another and talk...like...this. The whole movie is shot in masters, with the actors talking slow as we stare at their reflections in TV sets, mirrors, mottled windows. To a generation that has never seen THE SHINING, and may possibly have seen a few minutes of THE EXORCIST while flitting through the multiplex en route to a Freddie Prinze picture, Shyamalan's elephantine style may seem impressive. But is there any big-ticket moviemaker today, even James Cameron, who writes worse dialogue? ('Is there a name?' a doctor asks a woman holding a newborn in the movie's opening sequence--what pediatrician would not use a pronoun?) The primness and expository quality of Shyamalan's writing suggests a well-brought-up writing-class student who has, shall we say, not much touched life. But hey! most folks say, if you quibble. The guy makes a LOT OF MONEY! I can't think of a movie this year I disliked quite as much as this one--not even CHARLIE'S ANGELS, which, moronic as it is, at least moves quickly, and seems concerned with providing the audience the incidental pleasures of movies--pretty girls and jokes. Shyamalan is like a dime-novel writer who somehow has talked himself into thinking he's Dostoevsky. In an age when Shyamalan, McG and George W rule the roost, one can only quote Clint Eastwood at the end of A PERFECT WORLD: 'I don't know any thing any more...not a goddam thing.'",Null,1,2,26 November 2000
Memento," Man without qualities
","It's undeniably brilliant in a hundred different ways: Christopher Nolan's noir about a man (Guy Pearce) who can't remember anything prior to the last five minutes redefines how a movie creates 'suspense.' Pearce seems to know who he is and what his past is--he just can't 'make new memories.' As if he smoked a monster bowl of skunkweed, Pearce can only recall what has just happened...and just happened...and just happened. To add to the aphasia, Nolan plays the movie backwards, starting at the climax and rewinding. And just to give the audience a real challenge, he splices into this Moebius strip a phone conversation (about another aphasic personality) with an unknown listener--taking place...now? In the past? In a dream?'That was TOO, MUCH, WORK!' snorted an irate West Hollywood viewer at the end of MEMENTO. What probably really rankled this fellow was Nolan's ending--which, in a cruel stroke of genius, refuses to pull a cool, orgasm-like, Twilight Zone-style rabbit out of the hat, but instead frustrates all our desires to hear cymbals crashing. The greatest part of Nolan's achievement (based on a short story by his brother Jonathan) is that he has us guessing in new ways. Watching a linear, straightforward, Agatha Christie-style whodunit, we get clues based on a) the facts and b) the twitchy character traits of the suspects. Here, Nolan adds a question mark in regard to the time and the level of reality of any given event--making figuring out the big picture on the fly even more of a brain-twister.All commendable--and the complexity of MEMENTO, down to the tiniest details, is quite extraordinary. But one must bridle a little bit at seeing film noir turned into a Mondrian canvas, or an Alain Robbe-Grillet novel. Part of the pleasure of the genre--and narrative pleasure is Nolan's real, even outrightly stated subject--is in the human factor..of which MEMENTO has none. Noir is not just about story, it's about politics, psychosexual ooze, generational war, hidden kinks. MEMENTO is a story about story. And for all that it gives you to chew on--like what constitutes a human being when memory is peeled away?--it gives you nothing idiosyncratic and fleshly spilling over.Also, one shudders a bit at the audition-like quality of the movie. (Nolan is now directing a remake of INSOMNIA with Al Pacino.) Like the too-similar RUN LOLA RUN, and also the works of Darren Aronofsky, MEMENTO has a bit of the feeling of a soft-shoe for the studios. Too bad--because Nolan (maybe Nolans?) is a guy with a big, big brain.",Null,0,0,17 March 2001
The Others," Enough with the 'elegant,' 'atmospheric' chillers. More exploding zombie heads!
","The reason Kubrick's THE SHINING is the one successful haunted-house movie of recent times is that Kubrick went at the yin through the yang. Shorn of Gothic effects, the movie situates Gothic horrors in the stark fluorescent lighting and stainproof rugs of a Radisson Hotel Luxury Suite. A beautiful woman deliquescing into a rotting hag is somehow all the more primally horrific under cold all-around white light. All the old-dark-house cliches Kubrick and his co-scenarist, Diane Johnson, swept off the table in THE SHINING have landed in the lap of this elegantly directed thriller. (Those Kubrickian crumbs piled up in abundance in the absurdly overpraised, and overpopular, SIXTH SENSE.)Nicole Kidman is a single mom in a big creaky house in the moors. She has two kids who, she tells the eyebrow-raising new nanny, are 'allergic to light.' This has the convenient side effect of making most of the movie Caravaggio-dark; it also gives the director the opportunity to exercise his fluffing-sheets-over-the-windows and sudden-shock-of-daylight muscles. The kids have a dad who may or may not be alive, and may or may not be a soldier at the front. And soon enough, Mom, Junior and Sis' creepy, claustral little home-schooling world is interrupted by banging noises upstairs, clangor on the piano, and mysteriously self-unlocking doors...Alejandro Amenabar, the writer-director-composer, swirls up a tasty, classy, early-Hammer-horror atmosphere--Hammer before the pandering to sex. The Catholic mania of the mom is very cleverly built into her possible madness, and Amenabar deftly juggles all the possible layers of irreality and illusion that may be taking place at any moment. He's also lucky to have Nicole Kidman as the mother: not yet really a great actress, she is a great star, and she brings to the role a quality surprisingly similar to that of Piper Laurie in CARRIE--a raging sex-mad succubus underneath the church-white linens. Unfortunately, the movie is a veritable encyclopedia of creaky-door cliches. (The only one missing is the jowly, friendly constable who stops by and notices that...something isn't right.) The ending, a little evocative of Lucio Fulci, is nicely joined, but also a little too evocative of another, recent popular horror movie. (This being Anti-Spoiler Central, I won't give it away, but...it shouldn't take too much imagination to figure out.)",Null,0,0,20 August 2001
Chicken Run," THE GREAT ESCAPE, with chickens
","In what feels like the thousandth working-through of his Holocaust anxieties, DreamWorks' cofounder Steven Spielberg must have felt pretty odd in the scene in which two birds escape from...a giant oven? As a rundown of POW-movie cliches a l'oiseau, CHICKEN RUN is more intelligent and craftsmanly than its peers; fans of WALLACE AND GROMIT's dry wit will be amused. As a relative outsider, I found it a little poky and bland, if unobjectionable. As brainier-than-most animated fare goes, I preferred DreamWorks' more American, and more neurotic, ANTZ.",Null,0,0,4 July 2000
Insomnia," The Lifetime version of BAD LIEUTENANT?
","Al Pacino has become an overacting machine. For starters, as an L.A. cop in a heap of internal-affairs trouble, he puts on a Cajun accent more appropriate for a Paul Prud'homme biopic than a Hitchcockian policier. Why? Because it relieved the boredom, I guess; as does Pacino's insanely cliched habit of breaking up scenes by chewing gum. For one who should have learned something opposite DeNiro's elegant minimalism in Michael Mann's HEAT, Pacino has instead gone the opposite route. One feels as if an Actors' Studio Lifetime Achievement Show is playing inside his head 24 hours a day. Constantly aware of his Great Pacinoness, the man croons and whispers his lines as if every moment, no matter how routine, were an opportunity to thrum a big, fat bass and wiggle his fanny to the beat. He singlehandedly destroys this movie.The director, Christopher Nolan, is a little overfond of brain-grinding sudden-switchup mysteries--genre exercises that are the cerebral equivalent of tongue-twisters. But he brings a quiet mastery of form to this picture, and some of his key notes--a chase across some waterbound logs, for example, or the final shootout--have the staccato grace of a set piece by Walter Hill at his peak. There is also an avid, eager performance by Hilary Swank as the Nancy Drew who is Pacino's junior sidekick in solving a murder in remotest Alaska; she tears into the dopy part with a sensual avidity that's admirable, even if it doesn't help the movie much. As a murderous mastermind, Robin Williams is perhaps more egregiously miscast than any actor since Lyle Lovett played the sadistic baker in SHORT CUTS; it's as if Mister Rogers stepped into Hannibal Lecter's facemask. The whole thing would be a compelling enough programmer if not for Pacino. His last good performance was in THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE, where his goofy over-the-topness fit in just fine. Someone, please, team him with Adam Sandler, where his gifts will be put to good use.",Null,0,0,30 June 2002
X-Men," They're here, they're queer, get used to it
","It's the most dazzling Unconscious Subversive Moment of recent times. A right-wing Senator (Bruce Davison, famous for the bedside death scene in the AIDS weepie LONGTIME COMPANION) lies on a gurney, infected by a terrorist version of his bete noire--mutants. He has persecuted the mutants of the United States, and now they have made him one of them--at the expense of his body. In short, read it as: ACT-UP infects Jesse Helms with AIDS. And the climax of this tragedy comes when Davison (also known as the child molester in SHORT EYES) looks up at hit-and-run diva Halle Berry, a tragic mulatto in a blond wig, and asks, 'Do you hate normal people?'X-MEN is an Allegory of Queerness so dizzy and bent it could give Todd Haynes the vapors. Mutants--special people with special powers (read: desires)--are being persecuted by the right, threatened with 'mutant registration,' the firing of mutant teachers from grade schools, etcetera. An embittered Holocaust survivor (!), Magneto (Ian McKellen) plans to erase the un-evolved, pre-mutant human race. Buddha-calm, a mandarin Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) plans to save the benighted humans--even when they're picketing to throw mutants in jail. It's Martin Luther King versus Malcolm X--or is it Larry Kramer versus Harvey Fierstein? And to add weirdness to weirdness, Singer crams on the mutant superheroes, and their Magneto-driven nemeses, till you start to think the movie is a collaboration of Stephen King and Robert Altman--NASHVILLE set at a convention of the Tragically Telekinetic.Poor Bryan Singer had to do it all--satisfy the comic-book geeks, placate Rupert Murdoch, and throw together some high-priced CGI and a low-priced cast to make a concoction to rock the mid-summer bells. He gets better than a gentleman's C; the last half hour, a rock concert of dueling powers, suggests the operatic splatter style of Lucio Fulci's THE BEYOND. (Especially when a white-eyed Halle Berry is raising the roof and bringing on lightningbolts.) But Singer doesn't really have the pop-opera gifts of DePalma or even Paul Verhoeven.Oddly, his best moments are the biggest action set pieces, not the sensitive 'outsider' stuff. (Credit for that no doubt goes to the editors, the sound editors, Michael Kamen's score, the computer-animation guys...) As the dueling brains, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen have the right iconic quality, but unfortunately, no one else does. This is the kind of thing that has to be cast iconographically, physiognomically, like a Sergio Leone Western. Even when they fit their characters, the actors don't have that stamped-on-a-coin quality. (A possible exception: lithe, lissome Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as the shape-shifter Mystique.) Sequels could bent the perversity of it all in interesting directions. One hopes that next time Singer won't be tempted to outdo Renny Harlin in the eardrum-shattering sweepstakes.",Null,0,0,18 July 2000
Sleepy Hollow," The title says it all
","The screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker, the dark star of 8MM and SEVEN, must have envisioned this adaptation of Washington Irving's Headless Horseman legend as another of his dour, black nights of the soul; he even manages to work in decapitation of a pregnant woman #2. Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) was clearly painted, in some early draft, as a variant of the Nice Guy Charlie cops played by Morgan Freeman and Nicolas Cage who discover the world is a dank and evil place.But then Tim Burton set to work turning Walker's trendy angst-cloning into another of his campy pastiches of the horror culture of yore; and Johnny Depp tweaked the conceit further still. Depp added to Ichabod two elements clearly un-present in the script: the squeamish physicality of a snooty twelve-year-old girl (we like that) and a tendency to blanch, sissy-pants style, at the least sign of mayhem (we found that got old on the first try).
Christina Ricci, bless her heart, surely must join the ranks of other talented young actresses--Claire Danes is one--who must never, ever again be cast in a period movie. Limping back from the avant backlot of ED WOOD and MARS ATTACKS! to Main Stream, U.S.A., Tim Burton had a hit on his hands here that surprised me --its success must surely derive from the fact that today's teens on dates, pace BLAIR WITCH and SIXTH SENSE, like movies that seem to be 'horror movies' without actually being remotely scary. Burton's model here seems to be Hammer horror, but even the tackiest, late-in-the-cycle Hammer is rich in characterization.

Scary Movie 2," Sucky Movie 2,045,837
","The young actress Anna Faris, pale, moon-faced, with crisp blueeyes that recall the 'Oh, me!' shock of clean ingenues back to FayWray, is a lovable child who's full of promise. I am getting thefeeling that the Wayans kids have something against whitewomen, because in this sequel--even more so than in theoriginal--Faris is a punching bag for more abuse and humiliationthan a vivisected supermodel in a Dario Argento splatterfest. (If youthink I'm exaggerating and have a sagging sense of humor, justrecall that Keenan Ivory Wayans cuts to a CLOSEUP of asteaming, hissing bowel movement made by Faris...revealed toher 'comic' sorrow and shame.) Lazily thrown together in the wake of SCARY MOVIE's monstersuccess, 2 has none of the original's visual slickness or relativeaccuracy of gag-hurling (there, the ratio was about 1 in 2; here,more like 1 in 10). There are a few huge, convulsive laughs, butmost of the movie consists of gag-inducing grossout oneupmanship. Potty humor was once liberating--a protestagainst the decorum of 'clean' comedy. Now it just seems puerile--and it really does (as with Chris Elliott's shtik with a witheredhand) make me gag.

Cast Away," Triumph of the human spirit...howzat?
","CAST AWAY has gotten much praise as a sort of existentialblockbuster: Tom Hanks, a stick, a volleyball and a crab for awhole hour! J. Hoberman has memorably described as the'bleakest vision of human existence in studio filmmaking sinceDouglas Sirk's IMITATION OF LIFE.'Beg to differ. The key that winds this baby up is the theme thatunites most high-period Tom Hanks movies: the American can-dospirit. Like the guy using a sock and a ballpoint pen to fix aspaceship in APOLLO THIRTEEN, like the guy firing a pistol feeblyat a Panzer tank in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, Hanks' Chuck Noland,FedEx work and late-twentieth-century guy extraordinaire, doesn'tso much look into the abyss as kick its butt using technology and alittle bit of Yankee elbow grease. Hanks, a fan of 2001, seems tohave completely mislearned its lessons: no major commercialfilm artist, not even James Cameron, seems so enraptured by thetranscendent power of technos.The director, Robert Zemeckis, lays it on thick at the beginning:Chuck is a time-is-money type-A geek who sits with his fiancee(Helen Hunt) and plots out quality time with her as they both peerinto identical datebooks. (Had the movie not been inexplicably setin 1995, they could zap their Palm Pilots at each other.) Then,marooned on a desert island...well, you'd think he'd learnsomething about stopping to smell the roses. Or his laid-on-thickemotional blockedness. Or something, other than how to rub twosticks together. But, as if they studied Bresson and David Mamet,Hanks and Zemeckis have no time for sticky feelings. It'sprocedure, the how-to, that excites them. And though it must haveseemed terribly daring to spend so much time with one guyonscreen, a static camera, and no music or dialogue, this stuff isby far the most engaging in the movie.The movie gets inspirational in its last movements, a tribute tonever giving up, or not letting go of your dream, or love-will-show-the-way, or some other development-world cliche.The last moments of the movie are staggering in their inadequacy.The filmmakers seem to have eschewed every possible cornballending, every chance for cheap uplift...and then they replace it withnothing at all. The movie doesn't so much end as stop, as if thescreenwriter, puzzled and disgusted, threw his typewriter acrossthe room.The level of drama isn't helped much by the casting of Helen Huntas Chuck's beloved. Is there a more unsympathetic major femalestar in movies today? Hunt right now has the number one and twomovies in America. What are people seeing that I'm missing?

American Psycho," Kubrick with a vagina?
","Bret Easton Ellis' 1991 novel AMERICAN PSYCHO had some of the crazy snap you read about from first-time consumers of NAKED LUNCH back in the day. Universally condemned, its anti-eighties satire was none too subtle but beautifully fashioned by Ellis: the tale of an outwardly impregnable but inwardly demented un-soul, told in the voice of an irritable, funny, quick, spoiled, slightly gay frat boy. The power of the book comes from that voice, and from Ellis' virtuoso use of form--as we imagine ourselves into Ellis' fictional space, we find ourselves trapped in an airless, characterless, mannequin-filled vacuum.But it's funny--explosively, forbiddenly funny. That's the one element the writer-director Mary Harron gets on the nose in her adaptation, the first hour of which scores in the same way Milos Forman's MAN ON THE MOON did--by ripping off a really funny guy's best routines and just playing 'em straight out. Harron and her co-adapter Guinevere Turner find some nice opportunities to make Ellis' designer-drone prose cinematic--like wacko Patrick Bateman's choice to preface every murder he commits with a full-career review of an eighties AM-radio hack. (The exegesis on Phil Collins, followed by bloodbath, suggests the influence of the Ezekiel shtik from PULP FICTION.) And Christian Bale, an unlikely-looking Patrick Bateman, gives a daring conceptualized performance. Conceiving of Bateman as a non-self, Bale playacts goofily, as if cutting up for his fellow actors between takes. Since no one takes anything Bateman says seriously--even his confessions of gruesome crimes--Bale is free to thumb his nose and make googly eyes at everyone in the movie. He does so with an enormous charm that recalls Malcolm McDowell abjuring 'the old in-out.'In the last twenty minutes, as Bateman melts down, Gets Real, and enters a hairline-fracture maze of what's-real-and-what-isn't, Harron seems to take cues from Cronenberg's distorted-self tragedies. Well, she ain't no Cronenberg--though John Cale's score seems to ape Howard Shore's music for the Canadian master, and the production design tries (and fails) to be DEAD RINGERS punctilious. The movie ends with an unsatisfying splotch. (Ellis' draft of the script ended with a musical number outside the Statue of Liberty--an equally hopeless but more game solution.) In small roles, Reese Witherspoon and Willem Dafoe are, as they say, 'overcast,' and Chloe Sevigny forms a small delta of sweet hurt feeling as the overlooked secretary who needs someone to tell her she's pretty. Sevigny responds to kindness like a shy cat getting a rub on the neck. Her byplay with Bale is worth diamonds.",Null,1,2,14 April 2000
American Beauty," Middlebrow elegy
","This debut feature by the director Sam Mendes and the screenwriter Alan Ball seems to move people deeply--it's a haunting elegy for lives of quiet desperation to some. The hero, Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is a middle-aged wage slave who wakes up one day with a new slant on life. His wife (Annette Bening) is a success-crazed, sexless android more obsessed with her pruning shears and her garden of ripe red roses than the conjugal bed. His job at a media magazine, he finds, consists largely of 'masking my contempt for my superiors.' And his daughter is as sullen and insulated as a hedgehog, filled with recrimination for her absentee-landlord parents. The joy of springtime only arrives in the form of the daughter's best friend--a snooty blond cheerleader (Mena Suvari) onto whom Lester projects lusty fantasies: he imagines her popping her training bra, and an avalanche of ripe red rose petals pours out. In this seemingly ordinary girl, if nowhere else, Lester finds a way to make his drab life into a Rose Bowl parade.As directed by Mendes, in the underlining style of early Mike Nichols, AMERICAN BEAUTY has the bland but polished-to-a-gleam appearance of Quality Television. It's like a serious one-hour drama's Emmy submission. Alan Ball was previously a writer for CYBILL, and has a new series debuting called OH, GROW UP!, and the movie suggests the pitfalls of trying to construct a tragic dimension onto characters who are conceived in sitcom terms. Ball and Mendes want to have it both ways--they want characters as huggable and familiar as sitcom characters, but they also want to haunt us with the inevitability of their collapse, in the manner of one of the Coen brothers' what-fools-these-mortals-be noir scenarios. (Ball's script would be better served by the arctic detachment of the Coens' style in FARGO.)The movie sets up a series of dissatisfied suburban characters of different ages, including the most successfully drawn of the lot, a steel-plated teenage video artist with a savage Marine for a dad (well played by Chris Cooper), who is like a Victorian aesthete with the pressurized manner of a Vulcan. As this level-headed kid--surely an idealized self-portrait by Ball, the artist as the ultimate cool cucumber--the newcomer Wes Bentley gives a vivid, straight-shooting performance that's as refreshing as a faceful of cold aftershave. But as the shlubb hero Lester, Kevin Spacey seems incapable of conveying the sleepy depression of a very ordinary guy. Spacey is all subterfuges and subtext--that's the tricky delight of him as an actor. He makes the audience feel they're eavesdropping on his secretest, dirtiest thoughts. But he seems to have been cast here to make certain things about Lester questionable without having to state the questions outright, and the sight of him leering at a cute teenage girl is far creepier than Jeremy Irons' quivering in LOLITA. (Spacey's one-on-one scenes with Bentley have far more crackle.) Mendes' favorite acting style seems derived from a boffo Broadway show: he likes actors who illustrate emotions rather than being bulldozed by them. The whole movie feels overrehearsed, tidy. (Conrad Hall's cinematography makes diagrammable points.)You can see why the big cheese behind this movie, Steven Spielberg, responded to the material: Lester is like a Joe Sixpack hero in a Spielberg movie put through 'dark' and 'harrowing' paces in the clearest, most digestible way. After the filmmakers set up the characters, there's nothing left except to watch them hang out for an hour, and then wait to find out who will precipitate the tragic outcome. It's telling of the thinness of the movie's conception that the one character who never gets to become three-dimensional is Annette Bening's Caroline; even her moments of yearning and pleasure are cartoony, James L. Brooksish. The movie is as trapped in its need to please, to be 'presentable,' as the harpie Caroline is.All this said, the movie has stayed with me hours after seeing it. The sticking power of the picture, I think, is in Wes Bentley's character--his helplessness before his awe at the video images he records. He's the one person in the movie who genuinely doesn't care what other people think of him, and his mixture of ineffable loneliness and determination is affecting. With no irony intended, Ball suggests that the way out of hell for the characters young enough to escape is to flee to New York City.The thought that bohemian life in New York might not be its own rose-lined prison may be the funniest thing in the movie.",Null,0,0,16 September 1999

","I should've gotten off on it: the previously undistinguished director, Rob Cohen, stages two of the most amazing action set pieces of recent vintage--a nighttime drag race that approaches '2001' trippiness, and a car-and-truck joust that seems to smash together virtuoso sequences from DUEL and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. And the whole thing seems (deliberately or not) to be suffused with an aura of Roger Corman/AIP down-and-dirtiness. I amused myself trying to think of how it would have been cast in 1973: Jan-Michael Vincent as Paul Walker, and...Robert Blake as Vin Diesel? There's even Ted Levine, giving a fine performance as the requisite drive-in-movie Good Guy Cop in a Bad Suit.So what's not to like? Well, Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster, basically. The movie has Gary Busey attitude but a Freddie Prinze, Jr. heart. Though Diesel is a good actor, he seems to have a thought bubble above his head that says, 'Hmmm! I seem to be turning into the gen-y Stallone! I think I like it!' Walker tries hard and probably isn't worse than most male ingenues of this sort in the post-Gary Wopat era. But Brewster, a handsome, burnished-skinned, Ali McGraw type, is much too suburban and poshy for the white-trash role of Diesel's waitress sister, and Rodriguez, as Diesel's main squeeze, scrunches her face up into a just-sucked-a-lemon sneer and keeps it locked there for two hours.Where is this era's Robert Mitchum--hell, where is its Michael Madsen? The movie's heart is in the right place, and it's engaging enough, but it needs some guys who seem to have never in their life, not once, touched a bottle with the word 'moisturizer' on it.",Null,0,1,27 July 2001
Ocean's Eleven," The big time
","Can it really be that in his heart of hearts, Steven Soderbergh is notJean-Luc Godard, and not Martin Scorsese, and not even DonSiegel, but...Sydney Pollack? In the vein of Scorsese's AFTERHOURS, the OCEAN'S ELEVEN remake is a clear attempt by thedirector to take his skills-set to a new level by exercising it onmaterial that 'has nothing to say;' but where Scorsese's exercisesin pure style (like AFTER HOURS and CAPE FEAR) are triumphs ofsheer filmmaking verve over content, ELEVEN smacks of mereyeoman professionalism (at least, until its visually sumptuous lastthird). What makes Soderbergh different from the rest? Why does hisversion of this routine, Elmore Leonard-y guys-on-a-heist picturefeel richer, more human, more cinematic, more alive than the mostrecent 25 to have come before it? I think it is that Soderberghunderstands disparate things, like a) the handling of a 35 cameraand b) the handling of the chairman of Warner Bros. and c) thehandling of the biggest movie stars on the planet, that no one elsehas on their resume. The shaker-and-baker people, the BarryLevinsons and the Joel Schumachers, don't have Soderbergh'sdaring, his knowledge of movies, his love of the perfeect image;the other guys, the art guys, don't have Soderbergh's conciliatorymake-everybody-feel-good tactics. Even Spielberg (a far superiordirector) doesn't have a toe in both worlds the way Soderberghdoes.But something finally makes one bridle against this. Though someof the filmmaking in the latter half of OCEAN'S is spectacular, andthe tight, worked-out quality of Ted Griffin's script is impressive,one wearies of Soderbergh's endless titrations of brainy-yet-slickor slick-yet-brainy. He has proven that he can do the Hollywoodmovie nonpareil.

Man on the Moon," Milos still manages to make Burbank look like Prague
","This biopic of the situationist anti-comedian Andy Kaufman isn't much; the unjustly decorated director Milos Forman doesn't appear to have contributed much to it except a bevy of painfully obvious, point-making reaction shots seen against Kaufman's dada stand-up. The great pleasure of the movie, though, is that it's mostly a series of Kaufman bits--he did this routine, then this one, then that one--impersonated and taken to the next level by a career-high Jim Carrey. The kicker is not that Carrey nailed Kaufman's funny-voice personae--you saw that coming--but how beautifully he nails the stony, beatific, bland 'real' Andy voice. It's the kind of Rich Little performance that kicks the butt of nine out of ten 'transformative' Method performances. Carrey's bits as Tony Clifton, Kaufman's Vegas-scumbag persona, are the funniest minutes of film seen this year.The screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, having put the heads of Ed Wood and Larry Flynt on their living-room wall, went once over lightly on Andy Kaufman; their other biopics are screwy, ironic takes on the genre. Perhaps seeing the way Forman steamrollered their brilliant LARRY FLYNT script, turning an NC-17 RAISING ARIZONA into a swollen, Oscar-jerking tract about freedom of expression, they seem to have lazily just given the Czech genius what he wanted--boilerplate biopic stuff. ('You are insane, Andy...but you just might be brilliant!') And every moment involving the grotesque un-actor Courtney Love as Andy's designated arm candy is deadly dull. But the movie is a Carreython, and it succeeds better at mining his talents--his scrupulous mimicry and his fiendish commitment to the extreme--than any of his more mainstream vehicley movies. How strange that the most attention- and love-demanding movie star of modern times could so well understand a diffident performance artist who never cared whether the audience would walk out. Wags will compare MAN ON THE MOON to the 'pious' and 'hagiographic' (and actually quite brilliant) Bob Fosse treatment of Lenny Bruce, but no matter: the movie is an anthology of performance moments, and it has a public-service value as a reminder to a young generation of one of the last moments when it was possible to be both deeply transgressive and a pop-culture figure your mom has heard of at the same time.",Null,0,0,23 December 1999

Schindler's List," The lost world
","The critic Terrence Rafferty put it best: SCHINDLER'S LIST has a primal emotional power that hasn't been felt since silent film.
Those who prefer the post-structuralist beard-scratching of Claude Lanzmann's unbearable SHOAH to this movie are denying the potency of great populist art. Like Dickens and Griffith, Spielberg uses melodramatic techniques to make ideas palpable to a mass audience. In America at least, public perception of the Holocaust will be forever changed. You can carp that the audience's experience is synthetic, Disneyish, but is a fictional re-experiencing of these events worse than an abstract and remote noodling over them? Is it worse to represent the Holocaust in fiction than to leave it as a concept--and, as history bears out, a deniable one?As a work of filmmaking, it ranks with the greatest. In LIST, Spielberg arrives at a point--shoulder to shoulder with Scorsese --as the most dexterous and gifted of filmmakers working today. Scene after scene displays an offhand, unplanned-feeling mastery of the medium that staggers the imagination in its power. The cumulative effect--as in the best of Spielberg's earlier work--is of a long and sustained, almost unbearable cry of loss. Intellectuals have come to so despise Steven Spielberg, the mogul of Century City, that they have become blind to Spielberg the craftsman and artist. (Spielberg's smarm while receiving his first Academy Award didn't help this perception.) SCHINDLER'S LIST is the only film I've seen in my adult life where the screen disappeared; I was no longer aware of the construction of the movie and entered into it as spontaneously as a child. Surely Spielberg will never again find material that engages him so profoundly.

Rules of Engagement," A Few Good Men Go to My Lai
","For extreme-right-wing, little-brown-person-denigrating, jingoistic, racist, xenophobic major-studio pap, you'd have to go back to the liberal journalist David Janssen following John Wayne around and finally seeing the light in the 1969 GREEN BERETS. The proposition here is that Samuel L. Jackson is sent into the U.S. Embassy in Yemen to save the ambassador (Ben Kingsley, quivering with perfidy) and his family. He does--and even risks his life to run back and save the shot-up American flag. (Shtik like this was considered too corny not just in RAMBO, but in the RAMBO sequels.) As Sam and his Marines are about to make it out, shots--both from nearby snipers, and from a crowd of demonstrators gathered outside the embassy--are taking down Sam's guys. So he issues a command, which can be rendered on the IMDB as 'Waste those mudder fruggers!' And Samuel L.'s jarheads waste not one, not two, not a handful of bad apples, but every last man, woman and child in that pile of mudder fruggers. The next day, the cover of the Washington Post looks like My Lai, or the Guyana suicides.Through the course of the movie, Jackson's character never shows the slightest remorse--he isn't troubled in the least by the fact that at least a few of the people he shot (the six-year-old girls, say) might have been completely innocent. He's convinced he did what he had to do and what he was told to do--and anybody who disagrees is a conspiring, back-stabbing desk jockey keeping the godly warriors of our culture from winning the damn wars.The movie is a Vietnam-compensation fantasy, like RAMBO or UNCOMMON VALOR...but we're in the year 2000, and it plays a little creepy. 'This is a different world,' Jackson tells the Marine lawyer whose life he once saved (Tommy Lee Jones). 'No enemies, no friends, no lines, no Mom, no Pop.' RULES OF ENGAGEMENT tests out an evil new template: the Islamic fundamentalist as the stand-in for the Viet Cong (or Soviet) savage. Behind the heroism, the flag worship, the supplicating honor-guard musical score, lies the presumption that American lives are just worth a hell of a lot more than Yemeni lives--or, to use the prologue as an example, Vietnamese lives, either. And though the director, William Friedkin, fastens ghoulishly onto images of charred, limbless or blood-spattered children, the implication is made, as in THE GREEN BERETS, that that cute little crippled girl just might pull out a pistol and blast your American manhood clean off.Is Friedkin just a super-competent dude looking for a comeback, or is he subverting this material? I'd like to buy into the latter. His focus on the injuries done by Jackson to children are not just EXORCIST-style morbidity--Friedkin seems to be making the point that the script refuses to make: that Jackson's actions are evil and insane, and arguably deserving of a roomful of gas pellets.Samuel Jackson, Tommy Lee Jones, and the producer, Scott Rudin, one of the most intelligent guys in studio movies, all deserve to hang down their heads in shame for this one. This is the case of smart people--I include Friedkin in this--testing the waters of the post-Clinton era to see if Reaganite jingoism might make a comeback as a story template for pop movies. But none of the Sly or Arnold movies of the eighties was as morally ugly as this one. And using a black actor to sell this patently racist bill of goods is the ultimate insult.

The Insider," An encouraging word
","Michael Mann is fascinated by the upscale details of the material world. Designer eyewear shimmers on the faces of middle-aged men with an aleatory glint; neckties and restaurant furnishings are given solicitous, almost autistic attention. It's not that Mann's eye isn't on the ball of this muckraking drama; it's more like he's mastered the Zen trick of being in two places at once. It would be nice to say that Mann does the Best Work of His Career in this account of a tobacco-industry whistle blower's crucifixion at the hands of CBS News, but it's probably more accurate to say that he has his least knuckleheaded material in the solid-B-average, HBO-movieish script by Eric Roth. Russell Crowe gives a magnificent performance as the doughy would-be 'man of science' attacked with a crisis of conscience, and Al Pacino is his blustery recent-usual self as the '60 Minutes' producer who fights the good fight to put him on the air. The movie stays compelling even at two hours and forty minutes--much of it devoted to Mann's fascination with scenes played in silence, except for New Age ululating.

"Girl, Interrupted"," Lilith Fair meets Shock Corridor
","The Sylvia Plath wannabe sensibility gets a waify makeover as the producer-star Winona Ryder throws a pity party for herself. Based on Susanna Kaysen's spare memoir of a year-long stay in the bughouse, the movie suggests Sassy magazine on downers. Ryder is the tremulous heroine, an upper-middle-class daughter driven to the edge by status-crazed martini-sipping parents, and Angelina Jolie wears out her tomboy-cupcake vibe as the rebel hottie who flew over the cuckoo's nest. There are a handful of good scenes in the middle of the movie--in the best, Ryder and Jolie perform an impromptu version of Petula Clark's 'Downtown' for a depressed patient. But when Whoopi Goldberg, the movie's designated mammy and head nurse, explodes, 'You are a lazy, self-indulgent girl driving yourself crazy!' it's hard to suppress a standing cheer.The adaptor-director James Mangold gives the producer-star more adoring closeups since Falconetti played Joan of Arc. Why is it that everyone right now seems to think Mike Nichols is the model for film direction? Mangold's work combines the caricature of THE GRADUATE with the splinters of CARNAL KNOWLEDGE, and his use of sixties music makes FORREST GUMP feel inventive. (I never again want to see a movie where the characters stare openmouthed at a TV set as Fill-in-the-Blank has just been assassinated.) The movie teaches a sigh-inducing slate of girl-power lessons.

From Hell," Memo to Hughes Brothers' analyst: Discuss woman problem
","The Hughes brothers' adaptation of Alan Moore's graphic novelabout Jack the Ripper is crudely compelling but hard to respect.Even seemingly-misogynistic directors like Dario Argento andBrian DePalma build into their thrillers an awareness of thetaboo-breaking power held by images of vulnerable women beingphysically harmed. Their set pieces are not just displays ofvirtuosity, but have seismic emotional power. For Albert and AllanHughes, the slicing-up of prostitutes is just an opportunity foranother effect, a stick-on decal, an expensive sound cue.

The total effect is thesame as that of the brothers' last movie, AMERICAN PIMP--there isno directorial point of view save that of, 'Wow, cool!'

Any Given Sunday," Mythic potboiler
","Just as NATURAL BORN KILLERS nailed the pop-culture gestalt of the early nineties--a demon's brew of Springer, tabloids, gothic death cult, grunge aggression and early VH-1--so does ANY GIVEN SUNDAY make an A+ time capsule for late-nineties American pop-cult. The quintessence of Miami South Beach, booty-shakin', synthetic-but-hand-pressed, multiracial-but-still-bland, Mr. Sean Puffy Combs America--in short, late-period VH-1--is clutched in the palm of Oliver Stone's hand as if he were...well, a boomer intellectual Michael Bay, to be frank. You could say--if you were snide--that ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is BAD BOYS with metaphysics. But that would be wrong.What you hope for going in to ANY GIVEN SUNDAY--entertaining cheese on the level of the dingy but ever watchable WALL STREET--is not what you get. Stone may still be working on a corny level of melodrama, sometimes evocative of seventies disaster movies, but this isn't 'Oliver Stone's football movie;' instead, it uses the NFL as a prism to meditate on race, economics and personal ethics in the midst of the fat of a fin-de-siecle boom economy nonpareil. Those who think this is Stone's 'apolitical' movie have got 160 minutes of another thing comin'.It's also a work of studied portraiture on Stone's second favorite subject--his own bad self. Tony (Al Pacino), the beleaguered, alky-looking coach of the Miami Sharks, is a Portrait of the Ollie as a Midcareer Artist. (In a moment of Woody Allenish self-disclosure you wouldn't find in early Stone self-portraits, Pacino falls into the sack with silky-kittenish Elizabeth Berkley...then writes her a check for five thousand dollars.) Age is one of the prime sub-topics, given a rusty grandeur that's part mini-series, part Sophocles. Like the battered quarterback Cap Rooney (Dennis Quaid), Tony is out of place in a world of endorsement deals hinged on yards run, and quarterbacks cutting hiphop albums. The negotiation of young brash energy and seasoned wisdom is given a satisfying, motheaten workout. ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is Stone's COLOR OF MONEY--his show that he can still do the old tricks and keep the seats filled. And like COLOR OF MONEY, it ends with an ironic triumph that echoes that movie's resonant last line--'Hey, I'm back!'For all the attention paid to Pacino's sagging face, Stone directs like a rock-video god given his first hundred million. In a year where some of the world's greatest directors didn't seem to have their head in the game, Stone goes at the material not just hammer and tongs, but with blood, sweat and tears--there's as much of his tissue on the prongs of this movie as in BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY. And the style he's minted here--an aggro, stimulant-esque version of a VH-1 marathon--holds for an extraordinary near-three hours. Stone's impressionistic editing remains venturesome, rangy, impressive, and his work with music and sound nearly equals that of NATURAL BORN KILLERS--a career (and perhaps an art-form) high.Though the leads seem miscast (Cameron Diaz, God love her, may be the most committed major star in Hollywood movies--even to a dreadful part like the Owner's Bitchy Daughter), there are marvellous performances by the truckload here. James Woods doesn't do anything new as a company-man doctor who bends the rules, but he does it with a trim intensity, and some brilliant ad-libbing, that rank among his best work of recent years. (Somehow, only Stone knows how to put a choke collar on this guy.) Jamie Foxx is a revelation as a cocky kid discovering his own superhuman talent, and there are remarkable moments from John C. McGinley, Dick Butkus, Jim Brown, and Matthew Modine in small roles. Even Elizabeth Berkley is damn good. One of the tragedies of the career of Oliver Stone is that while he is known primarily for a) paranoia and b) manic editing, he casts and directs actors better than all but a few living American filmmakers.ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is a big, heady mixture--part potboiler, part philosophical campfire lecture from Shaman Stone, mixed together in a style that's somewhere between Hype Williams and Cezanne. It's a major Oliver Stone movie--and it's sad that it's being treated fondly and condescendingly, as if Stone directed a campy, gassed-up episode of KNOTS LANDING.",Null,0,0,25 December 1999

Since the shrink is never spoken to by anyone else in the movie, and the kid is the 'only one who hears voices,' the Stunning Surprise Ending that's promised is about as stunning and surprising as the end of a Polish joke. It's an indescribable experience to sit in an auditorium full of people who are held rapt by this brainingly obvious hooey. The writer-director, M. Night Shmyahan, has studied THE EXORCIST and THE SHINING, and, considering those films clearly too violent for this genteel moment in moviemaking, has taken one element from them--numbing, lugubrious slowness.

But seeing it again now, in the light of the current teen pap (all of which, AMERICAN PIE excepted, might have been co-signed by Tipper Gore), John Hughes' insistence on the pain of class differences (of many shapes and sizes) seems forthright and refreshing.
