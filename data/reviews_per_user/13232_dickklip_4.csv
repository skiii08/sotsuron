Source Code," Inception meets Ground Hog Day
","I was really intrigued by the this movie after seeing the trailer. It looked like high excitement, just a bit of sci-fi, and action with a tad of romance all rolled into one. I couldn't have been more fooled. This movie is such a disappointment. Without providing spoilers beyond what the trailer provides, the basic story line is an army helicopter pilot (Jake G.) wakes up on a train, but soon discovers he's not himself (literally), and soon after the train blows up. He then finds himself in a pod talking to another military figure who tests him and re-thrusts him back into the train scenario.The plot unfolds slowly, as we gradually find out who Jake's character is, why he's in this situation, and why he's up against the clock to keep returning to the scene and solve the train bombing in the intermittent eight minute intervals. In this respect it's like Bill Murray's role in 'Ground Hog Day'. In the plot line itself, the sci-fi aspect takes us to 'Inception' because the concepts presented really, really require you to suspend your disbelief and embrace this fantasy which goes from the believable to the ridiculous, by the end. There are the traditional good guys, bad guys, and the hero on a quest to save the train (and the girl). It is both exciting and boring at the same time, making you wish for the ending to come sooner. The only blessing is that it's a mere 93 minutes long. In my opinion this was probably and action movie made for teenage boys, but I'm willing to bet even they would grow tired of it. In summary. don't waste your time!",Null,1,3,13 October 2011
Superbad," Super Funny !
","Although this is a teen movie, and yet another teen 'gross out' movie, I'm in my 50s and enjoyed it very much. However, I will add a warning to that: my wife and I first rented the video, and couldn't watch it because it was too graphic and gross, but I ended up seeing the 'sanitized' version on TV which I liked very much. It all goes to prove that you really don't need the extremes to be funny. It also proved that not much has changed since I was a teenager. The story line is simple and basic: the nerdy kids who are going to be graduating from high school and going their separate ways are looking to have a booze-fest party, and get lucky with some girls in their class. What distinguishes the movie, however, is the characters themselves, who essentially start together, then go their separate ways in the night of partying at unexpected places, and eventually linking back up in the end. Their journeys are hilarious, particularly that of 'McLovin' who creates this identity on a fake ID and ends up spending this night in the company of two totally inept cops. It ends up as a fun adventure, with a lot of laughs, nostalgia for those of us who are older, and of course, a happy ending after all the uncertainty of the boys big night out. It remains unique however, and shouldn't be compared to 'American Pie' of other teen movies of this genre due to that, but if you like those, you'll like this.",8,0,3,24 February 2010
Les Mis√©rables," Thoroughly disappointing
","You can read other reviews for the plot, if you don't know it already. I had seen stage productions of 'Les Mis' several times and have a copy of the songs from the Broadway production in the eighties. I was really excited to see the movie based on my past experience (liked it very much), and the trailer. What I saw was thoroughly disappointing. They chose actors (some very miscast), rather than singers and it really showed. The 'live' singing detracted because many times the actors were either so out of breath, or so emotionally wrought that they couldn't sing at all-- talking or shouting their lines instead. The biggest example of this was Russell Crowe as Javert, who neither sings nor acts. Also, the constant use of extreme close ups while they sang became very tiring, and unlike live productions, limits what the actor can do to portray the real drama of the scene. Finally, the frequent and obvious use of CGI was another detractor from what could have been a good film. All in all, I blame the director, and have told everyone I know to save their money and stay away from this disappointing movie.",4,10,21,31 December 2012
Crazy Heart," The Dude Goes Country
","Take the Dude, Jeff Bridges character in the 'Big Lebowski', arguably his best ever, subtract the constant confusion, and add a jaundiced view of life, and you have Bad Blake, a down-on-his-luck, broken, middle aged country singer, who's now playing bowling alleys, and small lounges, while he drinks and smokes too much, and shacks up with whatever woman is left at the bar that night. While Crazy Heart is a good movie, it could have been so much better. It's a great character study in Blake, and really takes you through his tormented life, capped by now having to play as an opening act for one of his former backup band members, and at the same time trying to establish a relationship with a young reporter (Maggie Gyllenhaal), after four failed marriages. The music and musicians were excellent--I just there was more of it, like T-Bone Burnette did in 'Brother, Where art Thou'. But other than a few complete songs, we get mostly bits and pieces of the songs, and the creative process. What isn't so good is the lengthy dialogue, much of which is overdone, and too many romantic pointless romantic scenes, which are hardly believable given the age difference of the primary actors. (I mean really, do you think a girl like her would ever go for a guy like him?). It would have been better if there were more music, less talk, and an older woman playing opposite Bridges, who could really make us believe she is as flawed as his character. It's a good movie, still worth the watch, but too slow, and not as musical as it should have been. I just expected more. However, without revealing any spoilers, I can tell all you Bridges fans out there, that in the end, the Dude still abides!",7,0,1,5 March 2010
