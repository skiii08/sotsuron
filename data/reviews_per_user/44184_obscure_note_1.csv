Marie Antoinette," artistry orgasm
","Marie Antoinette is simply stunning, stunning, stunning! It doesn't have a lot to tell, and facts-wise, you'd be better off reading the biography. But this movie is great as it delights the senses. I am usually very detached from the environment, but this piece of Sofia Coppola's jolted my senses. In a good way. The decor, the costumes (courtesy of Milena Cananero, the same lady who dressed up the cast of Life Aquatic), and the brilliant soundtrack (chosen specially by Sofia herself I'm pretty sure - the girl has good taste) and the beautiful cinematography (long gaze of the palace, close-up shots of big fat colorful pastries on china's, pretty cards, wine overflowing glasses, among others) all contribute to this artistic masterpiece. Not too mention the amazing acting by Kirsten Dunst. She doesn't explode dramatically like Jolie or act in the stoic way like Johansson, but rather she breathes life into her acting in little subtle moves & expressions, and this to me, is a work of genius. This movie is a work of genius. Caution: not for the cynical.",7,1,2,21 June 2007
