Changeling," GREAT Directing, NOT for teens!!!
","this is a great movie. it has the zest of a 80's film. It has a lot of psychological appeal but most teenagers will not appreciate the directing and planning that goes into a film like this- (They'll be thinking OH HOW LONG IS THIS MOVIE, WHERE's THE ACTION etc). Of course, assuming they sneak in somehow (it's rated R for disturbing language and some horrific scenes, no sexuality involved)The first part of the movie is dull, prosaic and monotonous, it takes about 45 minutes to get into the CORE of the movie's substructure. This substructure plot is made up of 2 coinciding events: one is that the LAPD attempts to avoid embaressment by the media, and the other is a serial killer (in the Wineville murders). These two stories interplay into the life of Miss Collins, whose emotional burden is unparalleled. The LAPD pretty much screws her over, and that's the point of the movie. It's main focus is on the actions of the LAPD at the time and to narrate the life of Northcott , the serial killer.If you like psychological/mature adult drama, you will appreciate Eastwood's directing. He is a true genius of the camera and this film represents that (but it is Oscar bait: at 2 hours , it seems eastwood was doing this for an award). The trials at the end elicit sympathy and sentiment for the characters involved, and the viewer leaves with a sense of justice and hope. I have never seen a movie like this. It is long, it is great, and it exposes and inspires. the directors should not have rated R but due to a certain scene at the end, it had to be. great actors. bad thing is it is so hard looking at Miss Collin's face because her countenance is a cadaverous ghastly white, which is in opposite contrast to her lips, which are bright red. She looks so sick that she's hard to look at anymore.",9,5,10,8 November 2008
Kung Fu Panda," Just like every other movie, should've done something special with KUNG FU PANDA
","good animated movie for the kids but if you're not a fan of animated movies, of course this movie is not for you. this movie alone is not worth the money. voices are great, although i'm a bit tired of hearing Jack Black's voice. it gets quite irritating.Basically we've got a plot for an animated movie, that is overly didactic. The main character, a panda, learns his true dreams and pursues this dream, eventually reaching the zenith of his career. He achieves the seemingly impossible, with the indirect aid of his goose father and a kung fu master. Does this plot seem familiar? Mm hmm.This movie isn't special. It's purely entertainment. But it is more animated than most other movies, and a lot more vivid/character-involved. Sooo you'll guess correctly that it's kind of boring for the older audience. Kung fu Panda is fun but the humor is seriously directed to the younger audience (<14.) If you think it can serve as a source of inspiration for the young kids, in that anything is possible, then go for it.",6,2,8,22 June 2008
Shaun of the Dead," Not as good as sequel, Hot Fuzz, and a bit dull
","I watched 'Hot Fuzz' before this movie. Watching 'Hot Fuzz' made me want to see this movie really bad. I loved 'Hot Fuzz''s original style of humor (British comedy !!!) and its great acting, along with intricate plot. The camera work from Wright was different from any American films I've ever seen and made the film much more comedic and hilarious, and not stuck in 'one situation.' Hot Fuzz was one of my favorite movies of 2007. But when I watched 'shaun of the dead' I was not laughing, and the plot did not get me involved in the movie either. The jokes were lack-luster compared to 'Hot Fuzz'. Much of the comedy doesn't fit in. The acting is what got me through the movie, the expressions on the main character (Shaun)'s face actually had me laughing more than the jokes themselves. Watch this movie for the acting, not the jokes and plot/acting (there really is not a plot) but if you don't like this movie watch 'Hot Fuzz', you'll definitely be laughing at that.",6,1,2,2 February 2008
Hot Fuzz," GREAT MOVIE!!! lives up to it's ratings, very funny and suspenseful
","Action packed film filled with humor. The humor isn't dry and it is actually quite original. This movie was one of the best I watched in 2007. You will not want to stop watching (you will WANT to know what happens at the end). The acting is magnificent (the actors really hit their target when they were acting out their jokes.) the plot is suspenseful yet humorous at the same time. You will be at the edge of your seat. Fast-paced movie, but the action doesn't come in until an hour after- the first half of the movie is devoted to character development and plot build-up (climax). The movie is lengthy (2 hours). These 2 hours will be filled with adrenaline, literally. (Watch 'Shaun of the Dead' before seeing this! It's the prequel and just as good if not better than 'Hot Fuzz'---the actors are the same, but the plot is different.)",9,1,2,20 January 2008
Cloverfield," cliffhanger, storyless thriller
","This movie has been done many times before, 'godzilla', 'king Kong' and other big monsters attacking huge cities. you name it. The camera work makes this film 'special' but doesn't make the plot any different. The first 20 minutes, are boring, but the director successfully 'draws' us in into the characters had he not had the 20 minute introduction. Meanwhile, the entire movie is about running away and being chased. The plot and story are not there, and let's just say nothing is explained by the ending, making the movie a bit pointless- wouldn't you want to watch a movie to see what happens at the end? I doubt there will be a Cloverfield 2.",6,1,3,1 February 2008
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Entertaining, makes you laugh, not the best comedy but OK
","This is a comedy movie intended for laughs. Come with your friends and popcorn and prepare to have a good time. This movie made me laugh throughout, even though the script wasn't well-written and some jokes were lame, old and used. The acting is OK but you won't really notice it since this is a comedy. Unfornately, it's a comedy that's been done many times before. Most of the jokes are very old or just do not fit, or the characters cannot accomplish their effects to the full (as in Judd Apatow's other hits such as '40 year old Virgin'). I was entertained though, had a good laugh, left the theater smiling. It wasn't CRAP, it's actually watchable (the entire movie), and no it's not a family movie :)",6,1,3,5 January 2008
Batman Begins," Boring at first, gets a little more exciting, villain underrepresented.
","I 'm going to start off: I watched this after I saw 'The dark Knight.' Needless to say, don't do what I did. Not only will you not fully comprehend 'The Dark Knight', but this movie will be contradicting a lot of things you saw in the Dark Knight. It's not conventional practice, and it's awkward not knowing about the Batman.Needless to say, this movie was OKAY. I'm no judicious movie critic, but this kept me on my toes for a while. A bit monotonous, and if you have seen other superhero movies, 'Batman begins' is similar to the prototypes of 'action hero' movies. Nothing special, IMO, 'The Dark Knight' and 'Batman begins' is separated by a world of difference. 'The dark knight' had so much more of an intricate plot, but the Joker's abilities far outmatches the Scarecrow's normal human capabilities. Entertaining and a novelty, but alas, your mundane action movie sprinkled with garish action scenes.",7,1,4,24 July 2008
Schindler's List," Must-see War Drama. Informative, emotional and inspirational.
","I watched Schindler's List a week ago in U.S history class, and at first I thought 'Oh great!. I'm watching a movie on the Holocaust in black and white. How can this actually make me learn any more about the Holocaust than I have in a textbook?' My teacher put the tape on, and the first hour was a boredom fest, but as the characters such as Stern and Schindler develop their personalities, the movie becomes inspiring and hooked. I then removed the 'boredom fest' aspect of my thinking, and transformed it into 'necessary story development/build-up' At first we think Schindler is heartless, but having a personality and morales, he experiences the death of Jews firsthand. Of course, seeing such mindless mass executions will boggle anyone's mind. Schindler, who happens to be rich off of the Jews in WW2, helps them. The first hour of the movie is devoted to making the last 2 hours as commiserable for the audience as possible- making us feel connected to Schindler's emotions. 'What if we were in his shoes?' not only that, the movie is an excellent depiction of the Holocaust. Black-and-white does the film justice, as it gives the movie a 'WW2 feel.' If it were in complete color, it's effects would not have been as strong. Watch this movie if at all possible. Emotions cannot be depicted by learning about the Holocaust in a classroom- you are simply being educated about the facts. Schindler's List reinforces this classroom learning by supplying empathy with the facts. After reading about WW2, this is one of the few movies that are a must-see. The acting, directing and editing is marvelous. Only problem I had was the length of the movie.",9,9,13,2 February 2008
Stardust," Good movie...not a must-see, but a fantasy-love story
","This is a good movie...on the first run. We watched it a friend's house in High Definition. The picture quality is superb, spectacular at best. To put it in terms of a high school perspective, this movie takes the clichÃ© fantasy love-goochy goochy theme and puts it into an epic, 'Lords of the Rings' type of setting, where there are 2 worlds (don't recall the names of the 2 realms). One world is the magical world. The other is the human, non-magical realm. The movie takes place in the magical world. There are some bitter, (inane) witches. They duke it out with the 7 sons of a king who is about to die. These 7 sons must kill each other to take the realm of the king, but first they must capture this 'special' pendant. The pendant is actually a special gem that takes the form of a beautiful, shining, 'star' woman, who runs into the main character. No, I can't remember any names, but that's the basic lowdown. BUT WAIT! There's more! The good part of this movie is, it's exciting! I was on the edge of my seat for a good 20 minutes (not continually). And as a friend puts it, there is an 'anticlimax' at the end- something you didn't expect to happen. At least to us. So you should go see this movie, in HD if you can. The picture quality is amazing. The plot isn't unique, but the actors make it so.",8,2,2,21 February 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," OKAY...this movie definitely CAN be shorter...and needs to DEVELOP..
","This movie does not deliver! All the way throughout the movie, you go through Button's monotonous life, because he's taciturn, more taciturn than ANY viewer likes to see him. Here's how taciturn he is: he doesn't reply back with more than 2 line replies from any character in the movie. This alone destroys the 'emotional' feel of the movie, because how can one sympathize or connect with Benjamin if everything is processing inside his head> (You just want to yell at him for not being able to chat...) There's no 'climax' to this movie. It's just a movie on his life with no moral. I can imagine females loving this movie (because they love these types of movies and the 'hot' actor Brad Pitt.) but your typical male (like me) will not enjoy this movie. Males who say they enjoy this movie probably are critics or heavy movie watchers (and critique, or think A lot), both of which make them not typical; smart men, this movie is for you.This is pure Oscar material. It's not entertainment-friendly. 2 hours 40 minutes of pure 'getting to nowhere'. Sure there's a conclusion at the end, but what have I just learned from sitting here for almost 3 hours? None of the characters really 'progress', and there's nothing about this film that audiences will remember for longer than ...a year?",5,4,9,28 December 2008
The Dark Knight," Non-Stop action movie, HYPED AND READY!!!
","This was the best movie this year! I'm sure all of you know the plot if not then read the other comments. The best(or worst) part of the movie, is of course, sometimes hard to keep up with what the Joker and Batman are trying to say, along with trying to interpret Batman's outrageously deep voice (it was so hard to hear it sometimes). buttt you will enjoy the action, plot, and drama in this movie .. it's much better than the first one...and a lot longer, at an almost 2 hour 30 minutes...yet every scene counts to your understanding of the end of the film. As the Joker undermines Gotham City (by using psychological warfare/fear), you will both hate and love him. Some of the things he does in the film are extravagant and heinous; you will be disgusted, guaranteed. Don't mind Christian Bale's monotonous perspective; don't think too much about the corruption of Gotham City's cops. And admire Joker's tentative and ambivalent personas.make sure you relax and enjoy the ride. Batman has a tough challenge.!",10,6,12,19 July 2008
The Simpsons Movie," The hype is justified.
","'The Simpsons' movie offers fun for the entire family, and not just for those who laugh at anything, either. The 90 minute jammed-packed comedy made the audience literally 'LOL' every minute. The elements of humor, satirical, political & random- is what you expect in a Simpsons movie. It's a bit different than the regular 30 minute shows, since the movie is too short to have a really meaningful plot. Homer Simpson has doomed the town of Springfield. By dumping hazardous material into a lake already haunted by years of toxic treatment, Homer indirectly causes the destruction of Springfield. The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency). After capturing a specimen (squirrel) that was transformed into a mutant squirrel , they decide to trap Springfield in a large dome that is indestructible. The entire town of Springfield, unable to leave anywhere outside the dome, become lunatics and drive the Simpson family out. The Simpsons have to survive and save their city.This was a funny movie. Don't go in expecting a rich storyline or some sort of developing plot. That's not the point of the movie, all it intends to do is make fun of the characters, and hopefully make you laugh the whole time. Bring friends and family!",9,2,7,27 July 2007
