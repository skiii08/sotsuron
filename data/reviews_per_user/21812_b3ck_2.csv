Hereditary," Better as a drama, than a horror
","First half (creating the situations and setting) could have been shorter. The ending is a bit boring after all, especially compared to the continous tension, which the young director maintained till the end (absolute good point). Cut (change) the last 10 minutes and it would be far-far more enjoyable, and now I wouldn't feel myself as fish-slapped puppet.",5,0,1,2 December 2018
Whiplash," An excellent movie
","107 minutes of endless tension and flurry. I watched this at 3 am and there was not even 1 minute when I felt drowsiness. Whiplash shows how to keep attention, drama comes when it has to, and, of course, J. K. Simmons' play was extraordinary.",10,0,0,29 November 2018
