"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Dressing Well Is The Best Revenge
","This is a visually interesting and attractively well-designed movie. The clothes in particular are really inventive and fun and the Australian desert makes for some intriguing and disparate vistas and backgrounds, particularly for the dance routine at the Aborigine camp. Some of the set pieces, however, cannot be considered realistic and it is clear that they are merely moving the plot progress or creating a situation in order to provide an excuse for plot development. It should have been more organic and natural.Finally, I gave it an above average review because the performances were so strong; it was totally believable that Guy Pierce and Hugo Weaving were both not only gay men and serious drag queens, but talented drag queens at that, no easy task indeed.",7,4,8,10 January 2005
Inside Man," Excellent Story
","The movie has an excellent plot and well-thought out script; some things that didn't need explaining (such as the fact the 'bank robbers' were digging a hole in the supply room, NOT the bank vault, in order to gain access to the sewage lines so that Clive Owen's character would have access to a bathroom during his one week 'stay' in the bank), however others, such as how the robbers knew about Mr. Plummer's documents and the safety deposit box were not and should have been clarified more. There are some holes in the movie. Why Mr. Plummer would retain the diamonds and the Cartier ring can be readily deduced: he felt either guilt or remorse over the friends he betrayed and, not needing the wealth, kept the diamonds and the ring as a reminder of what he did. This is apparent from the plaques and his need to 'atone' for his WWII 'crimes' once he founded the bank. What isn't as readily deducible and certainly not apparent is why retain the document with the swastika and why keep it in a bank vault that he did not have full control over. The one disappoint with the film is the elements that Mr. Lee clearly felt it necessary to add, among the more glaring of these Mr. Washington's comment to the Sikh bank employee about catching a taxi, and the entire dialogue with the young African-American boy about his video game (his father was too readily educated and too clearly readily interested in his child to either not be aware of the type of game his son was playing or to not participate in his child's leisure time pursuits.The one poorly thought out plot hole was the entire pen with a recording device and the fact that a true power broker/power player wouldn't have readily and easily done something to the detective rather than allow him to hold something over her head as well as over the Mayor. Making Mr. Washington the 'hero' in a movie that didn't require that was unnecessary, unless it was forced as part of his contract or the director's affection for this actor. Likewise, from other Lee movies, it's clear he does not have much respect for women, for the entire portrayal of the Hispanic woman in the bank, her interrogation as well as that of the female bank robbers and Mr. Washington's putative fianc√©.However, it's an excellent plot, crisp, generally well made, readily enjoyable and certainly good. It just could have been superior.",Null,1,3,2 April 2006
The Island," Technically proficient but the story lacks:
","Conceptually, the movie has some interesting ideas, similar to much Sci Fi. As it takes place in the near future, it's not particularly science fiction as it is more fantastical. However, ultimately, it is an action thriller with many chase scenes, and not much else. Technically, it's exceedingly proficient. The performances are, generally good, although some of the talent is clearly underused. Ewan McGregor does an excellent job, especially when he meets the gentlemen who took out the insurance policy which underpins his role. Unfortunately, the story just has far too many holes, not the least of which is the number of people involved at The Institute who would be aware of what was going on. If they had spent as much energy on the story and writing as they did on the sets and action sequences, they could have come up with a far better movie.Generally, worth a quick look see if it's on TV or you wanted to rent something mindless, but if I had paid for a movie ticket, I would have been highly disappointed.",Null,1,1,15 October 2006
