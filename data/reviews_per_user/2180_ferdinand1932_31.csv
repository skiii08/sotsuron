Vertigo," Pretentious miss
","Despite it's elevated status, which has come from criticism and academic analysis, Vertigo remains a boring experience, even with many interesting thematic facets.Hitchcock told Truffaut that the interest/suspense in Vertigo is what Scottie might do. That question had been the bedrock of Hitchcock's cinema but Scottie as played by Stewart is too ambiguous; he is reactive and weak. The lack of vigor in the character makes his falling love with with Madeleine barely believable, and his constant pleading with her is altogether too weak.Compounding the problems is the plot, the structural mechanism, of the story that is also not believable. The orchestration of the scheme requires credibility and here it is strained: the choice of policeman; the discovery of Judy etc it's rather like those English mysteries that Raymond Chandler mocked because it is contingent on rare elements to bind the entire piece together.And Novak's performance, which despite a reappraisal recently, seems to demonstrate that she never really progressed beyond the nervous rabbit role play at drama school. She is , as the expression has it, wise with a closed mouth, but once she speaks the mystery is gone. Her eyebrows are also quite frightening.Vertigo has great music, locations and an intriguing idea for a story (one that would have been gripping in a novel); but equally it has dull driving scenes, over written dialog (Pop's story in the bookstore) and two lead actors who are far from ideal. This is one film when the themes and not the material on screen excites comment, and more film Phds no doubt, but it is pretentious miss in Hitchcock's golden decade.",6,6,13,20 September 2010
Changeling," Amongst the best of American cinema
","J. Michael Straczynski and Clint Eastwood deserve many honors for this because chief among the very good acting ensemble and the technical realization etc, the writer and director stand high.Like 'Chinatown', this movie's story starts simply and then opens out into directions that were not foreseen; it takes in the worst of people, and takes on themes that are not easy in mainstream movies any longer. Straczynski's script is well poised, with clarity and well defined differences in character. The narrative drive is balanced and always engaging. Indeed it may be a school for scriptwriters like Towne's Chinatown continues to be.And then there's Eastwood's direction, precise, integral to the story and timed so well that like all of his later films it has a distinctive sense of time. Just count the beats, it is unlike any other director. It makes the reaction shots work, it gives space to the pauses, and because the actors are thinking under the direction, these are not dead spare, unnecessary moments. It is distinctively American in tone and phrasing.If there is one small snipe it's Eastwood's musical score: they are sounding too similar with their limpid, even folksy simple, melodies; and while they work in parts, they are not the strongest artistic element.And central to the project is the story which is one of the best and saddest and proves why strong stories still make engaging movies.",9,2,5,18 April 2010
Child 44," Praiseworthy but pedestrian
","This is impressive to look at: the production design and photographic composition are really strong. Likewise, the story and setting is engaging; the corps of actors are all very capable and even the the use of rather feeble Russian accents does not induce mockery, more sympathy for a rather bad decision.And yet, despite all the obvious qualities this movie somehow misses. It is still a strong movie, better than many, but it could have been, or should have been more memorable, more compelling.It lacks energy, it drags and plods along, which may be due to its length. Maybe the editing is the cause and a re-cut could give it more spark, or even condense it to bring tighter focus. It doesn't need more action for its own sake, rather a condensed framing.Or maybe despite the setting and historical scenery it is another cop on the trail of a killer movie story and well, that has had a many, many excursions.",6,3,4,16 November 2015
Fury," Turkey shoot
","Starting well, if slowly, and not very coherently, the look and development is quite good, though much in the wake of Private Ryan, all those years ago.The narrative does the old trick of the new recruit and his immersion in war. The tank crew, tight and loyal, are all there to instill what is required to the new dude. It's not a new presentation; it's not bad and looks very good and the early battle scenes are realistic, in tension and dramatic flow.And then it fails. There is the final cataclysmic battle. Films like this can only go in two ways: either everyone lives or no one does. If no one does they are heroes and that's the formula here. What is quite repulsive is the length of the final battle scene which has an immobilized tank and its crew outwitting hundreds of enemy troops. It turns into mass slaughter as if this is what what heroism is all about but it also deceives the viewer - as all those 1950s and '60s movies did with German soldiers running into a hail of bullets as target practice for the smart US/Allied soldiers.It defies sense, and also the historical record as to how the German troops were led at this time, in their capacity to improvisation and battle tactics, which makes this final scene so completely sickening as a violent fantasy; it undermines the ideal of heroism and how battles are fought in real wars. It plays to the juvenile male spectator who is accustomed to the thrills of software games, not actual battles.In all, it's a Hollywood fraud, worse so because it starts well and with the virtues expected of the material, but leans to the cheap and moronic, and as such, deserves nothing but contempt.",2,25,49,28 November 2014
Darkest Hour," Almost history
","As a film this is quite good; it's not dull, the performances are good, the production design is excellent, the script is a professional piece of work and even Oldman's make-up is not too distracting. However, something is not right. If most people get their history from movies, this is concerning. It's obvious that actual events occurred with real people and what they did and said but in a movie this gets pasteurized into what smart people believe will be more thrilling, more sympathetic, more emotional. That process necessarily alters things into something that is even anachronistically rendered and therefore not in the record.This defect occurs frequently in this movie , so it's not history but myth making. A good example is Churchill's dive into the Underground to meet the common person to steel his resolve. Now Churchill had a mixed view of the average voter, and he was a patrician, but even that aside, he did not need to take a Tube train survey to gauge opinion. This scene is poached from Shakespeare's Henry V where the king goes among his soldiers the night before battle to hear them and take courage from their strength. Steal from the best is a good policy, but it's not history. It's Shakespearean history and that trades effect for accuracy too.The audience is given this scene to present Churchill as an instrument of democracy; he's acting for what the people want, therefore he's doing the right thing. It's called pandering.Well, it is just a movie.",6,220,290,11 February 2018
Troy," The simplistic version
","This is a reasonable enough attempt at the Troy myth. The fight and battle scenes are very good; the best part of the whole film. The technical aspects too are strong.However where this film falls apart is that it is a comic book version of the story. The dialog is utterly banal. It's not bad; it's just boring and banal. It's all super heroes and super strength.This myth is not just strong for the story, it's because it was treated by really great writers in a number of plays and poems. Homer, Aeschylus and Euripides were really great writers.Take Euripides's 'The Trojan Women' which was made into a movie in 1971. That retains the tragic destruction of war and the obsession with pride amongst other themes.This movie has epic fights egos from the warriors but the other themes are all absent. The other characters, the women in particular are non existent.For a young audience that lack of depth is probably fine enough but it's like so many film versions of classic works, its not even close to being the real thing.",3,1,1,27 September 2013
The Book Thief," How would Lubitsch have done it?
","There's a mainstream middle-brow type of writing and film (music too) which was what the Nouvelle Vague in the 50s called the 'Cinema de Papa', that is to say, it is thoroughly conventional. It tends to platitudes, to echo the views and moral perspectives of the very average. Tradition is not a bad thing, not on its own, yet with a film like The Book Thief, it goes over much repeated material in a form which is so well known as to induce narcolepsy.While the film is comprised of a number of much adored clichés, especially as it deals with this historical period, it assembles them as pure kitsch.The world is viewed through the eyes of a child, her parents are forbidding, her father kindly, almost like fairy tale father; the historical and social fabric is rendered in simplistic reductive episodes and the script delivers such gems as, 'A human doesn't have a heart like mine. The human heart is a line, whereas my own is a circle, and I have the endless ability to be in the right place at the right time. The consequence of this is that I'm always finding humans at their best and worst. I see their ugly and their beauty, and I wonder how the same thing can be both.' That is not writing – it's Barbara Cartland. It's the sort of drivel book clubs consume, with its hallmark card insight and ladles of sentiment.The film proceeds at a solemn pace, suggestive of its deeply human feeling, which means we have to endure two non German actors use something like an anemic Germanic accent with added inflections as though they might come from the shtetl. Other characters are similarly afflicted with shifts between some real German and then awkward accented dialog. Why someone says 'Nein' then continues talking in English is like the muddled logic of a 1960s Disney movie.Billy Wilder was known to have a sign in his office that read, 'How would Lubitsch have done it?' It was a check for him, a guide, to find that course of action that was right and sharp. It is true to say that both Wilder and Lubtsich would have passed on, or rewritten, The Book Thief. It is a banal piece of work.",2,56,107,14 January 2014
Black Mass," Fuhgettaboutit
","By now we've seen this format often enough with its well-rehearsed drills: men in suits and big ties: large hair on everyone; a soundtrack of known and more obscure period hits; moody settings in bars, wasteland, and a shabby district of town; a protagonist that is attractive in a psychopathic sense, a supporting cast of solid actors embellish the entire piece; a script with a couple of strong scenes and a memorable line and bada bing - it's a quality piece of work.There's little wrong with this movie: some people may quibble about Depp (who seems to have channeled a bit of Nicholson from The Departed as he filched Keith Richards for the pirate series), but really, it's not worth the struggle. We've seen it, or a variation of it a few times and it does nothing new. So it grinds on to it's inevitable conclusion and then we forget about it.If there is tedium it's in the script which skates over the material in the standard ways, although it offers a central focus over loyalty, but somehow this too has been over done, overplayed too often as well.It's not bad, it's not great; its just another product off the line.",4,3,4,11 October 2015
American Hustle," Casino - Part 2
","In 'Casino' Scorsese made a strong film in film technique and narrative. 'American Hustle' is essentially another version of that film in its form and how it plays out. The result, though, is a film without any originality, or new ideas, in any way at all.This takes a standard double cross storyline and uses all the obvious devices to tell the story using reliable and traditional forms such as voice-over to tell the narrative and back story, not to embellish, but just tell the story. It then adds music from the era in a cookie cutter form to gild montage sequences.On top of that add 1978 costumes, hairstyles and hairpieces and those huge cars and the recipe is complete. This is high on style but it's all been seen several times before. The camera moves in regulation turns and the final result is convincing. Yes, it's fine; it's even very good, if you've never seen it all done before.There is no reason to avoid this movie; it is quite well made, but equally there is no reason to watch it either. It just shows what it takes to be bankrolled now to make a second rate copy of another movie made almost 20 years ago.",4,3,10,31 December 2013
The Aviator," Something's missing
","With a record of deep and troubled portraits: Travis Bickle and Jake la Motta, Scorsese has all the ability, and more, to deliver on a strong level about Hughes. But somehow it doesn't.On the good side there is the slick and rich production, the moving camera (adapting FW Murnau), the design, the flight sequences are extraordinary, even if a little too CGI, but still exciting. The romance with Hepburn is intriguing but it goes nowhere and doesn't say much about Hughes at all. Blanchett really takes this movie over in her performance.On the negative side, when the Hepburn story is over the movie drops in intensity. Hughes is a weird and ill man and unlike Scorsese's other damaged properties, the illness just removes any possible connection. Sure, as Pauline Kael said, 'Raging Bull' was about pond life, but it had an eloquent story about America for that group of people. Here the overt illness and script are more like a boys own adventure gone wrong but it does not connect to the wider themes that Scorsese was probably targeting, as he has in other movies. At the end the resonance is not there as it was with Travis Bickle: Hughes is not like the viewer with his OCD.But more difficult is the casting of DiCaprio, where he is a capable actor but his face is wrong: it's too sweet, it's too young. It's not fair, because he does a good job but it still doesn't fit the movie but DiCaprio is a key reason why it falters. Billy Wilder said casting is everything and here that maxim is true. Movies rely on faces and close ups and how audiences respond to faces, and with movie stars, the baggage they bring, how the audience feels about them and the roles they take is crucial to acceptance. In this respect DiCaprio should have passed on the role.",7,2,3,5 April 2010
Apocalypse Now," A grand failure
","Apocalypse Now and Then is what screenwriter Robert Towne said of this movie: magnificent and a shambles in equal measure.It's sprawling range and portentous style are awesome as is the photography and there are many failed films saved in reputation by the photography. Citizen Kane being a prime example.While it's worth watching, even in parts according to interest and time availability, the first hour is better than the rest, and especially the third hour in the Redux version.The reason is the writing: a narrated film about a character that has not appeared is not a drama, it works in a book, and Hearts of Darkness is stunning prose, although the portentousness wears thin toward the second half.In a movie the novelists' technique fails because we can see the world, framed and edited, but essentially realistic. In that space the drama should be performed, or else it's a novel with pictures and a narrator, which is what Apocalypse Now is. The writing has to be interesting, in the narrator's mouth and the dialog, as there is little real drama happening to keep the audience involved, but here the script misses exposing the extent of Coppola's mediocrity as a writer.In Apocalypse the characters are meaningless, although events happen to them to show the audience how depraved war and this war was; but on and on the background intelligence progresses as the real drama is an intellectual one played between US foreign policy and the American people, especially those who were anti war.",6,3,8,27 March 2009
The White Ribbon," Absolutely stunning
","This at once reminds of Bergman's trilogy, and of 'Through a Glass Darkly' especially. It's little people, and everyone is little under such a huge theme as the nascence of violence and terror, that are almost fatalistically sent on their own trajectories. It takes skills as a dramatist to make something such as this, with complex ideas framed in place and time.But the big philosophical ideas apart, the technique, writing, the photography, the way the actors perform, the execution of this film is simply stunning. The voice over narration that begins sets the place but does not lazily tell, it is elusive and leads into the action. Like much else in this film it is superbly balanced, not too much or it would undercut the action. The set scenes between actors achieve a finely tuned naturalness and rhythmically counterbalance the forward action of the script and the interplay between the actors so another degree of interest is revealed and what it might lead to.It is not predictable, not with the range of characters, the events that occur and a very strong evocation of place in a film in quite some time, make this worth watching again and again.",8,3,8,27 May 2011
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," A star each for the photography and Candian locations
","When the photography and landscape are the best and only good elements to a film, it is bad. Indeed both photography and location are time used covers for a bad film and this one is really awful.What's wrong with it can be summed up in Billy Wilder's comment about Titanic: Where's the story in that? In this film it lacks any dram at all, it has been written and conceived as a extended Ken Burns' historical film. But like the magisterial series Burns did on the Civil War the explication and narration of events clarifies and reveals, it is not dramatic unless the use of that word is so misunderstood.In 'The assassination....' the same strategy is used with voice over narrating what is being shown on screen. That is not bad: it's not even admissible to film school, its so bad. Nothing is dramatized, the dialog has all the characters talking in similar cadence and the central relationship between James and Ford is left ambiguous, when it is the crux of the film.The result is a bloated, pompous, and over long movie; of course, as if the narcoleptic effects of such a long film will add significance to it. No it won't and it will join 'Heaven's Gate' and 'Days of Heaven' as failures.",2,3,7,4 September 2010
The Favourite," Innuendo
","This is a stylish and innovative genre film. The camera movement and angle of photography is not typical for such a film. Similarly, the writing approach is fresh and the terse characterization, along with dialogue, has a sharp and regenerating effect. Add the locations, and the strong cast around the principals, and it's an entertaining film.Even with these artistic qualities it's a bit of a hoax: it's not history and it's not genuine biography. Sure, it exploits historical entities in some inferred behavior, but that is just speculation and not even toward an objective, that is to say, that some imagination was used to concoct as to why a policy was imposed, such as to pursue a war. No, this film is simply a salacious invention in order to titillate an audience with the idea of what may have occurred. Possibly.In itself that is not incorrigible: Robert Graves did it brilliantly in his books on the Roman Empire. But it is just fiction, it's not history and it's no historical biography, nor anything like it. It's gossip and innuendo.The question then is: would anyone watch this if it was invented and just about three women at any time, or does it only work on the basis that it might have been historically true and that authenticity is the necessary ingredient in which an audience gives its time. If that contingency of historical truth is removed than it's a type of fraud because it means only the smallest measure of historical truth makes it watchable and for prurient reasons.",7,2,3,5 January 2019
Revolutionary Road," Complex and rewarding
","The theme of the authentic life was intellectually popular it the Fifties. Existentialism made it a movement: Sartre and De Beauvoir explored it: in her case more successfully, as she is a better writer.This film depends on the leads and DiCaprio has this in the bag: his performance is just ideal, a mix of hope and rage, He looks and sounds the part. Winslett is fine as April but her character is very complex and almost too ambiguous to really understand. She speaks in a strange and restrained manner which withholds her from the action. That is not to say it is wrong, but rather it is unusual in movie terms.In fact Winslett's April Wheeler is the crux of the story. It's hard to know whether their marriage is bad anyway, or if moving to Paris will solve anything. April Wheeler has creative instincts as shown early on by acting in a play, which are frustrated. Husband Frank Wheeler is like thousands of people who say they have a novel inside them but in fact they concede their vague and possibly vain ambitions by increments as they manage day to day life.It is a shame that this story ends badly as if they, and no one, can ever win the battle to escape the 'burbs, the job, the predictable and inauthentic business life.The device in this story of having a 'crazy person' tell the truth serves a plot purpose but is not very stylish in 1961, when the book was published.. Shakespeare used it, in having the fool tell kings about reality.Deakins's photography and Mendes's guidance are superb, the tone is right, as are the production qualities too. This film will provoke thoughts for a long time after.",7,0,1,1 May 2010
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Recycled
","Like being on long-haul flight 'Once upon a time' gradually erases the past and a sense of purpose inside a compressed space where the inflight movie consists of tracking shots of 50 year old cars on LA freeways with contemporary pop music. In between, the dramatic action is provided by actors who cruise, chew the fat, and utter prosaic lines in a knowing way.It's then you wished you'd packed some good books, for example, books on cinema, semiotics and pop culture because it borrows, poaches and re-uses ideas and tropes which have been employed elsewhere and always in more incisive ways.The era is observed through a Warholian gaze of banality: the TV shows, the songs, the mundane utterances of no interest, which are crafted like TV adverts i.e. a dumb slogan or assertion. Bereft of creative ideas the only strategy is to repeat, and once scaled up, the entire fraud almost resembles something like another better film.People driving cars are not inherently interesting, nor are their faces, not even with the winking use of a song over the image. Do it over and over, pastiche the era, and perhaps it's a style. Or not.In any case, it's a trick any film school neophyte can do and upload. And pastiche is something any artist can do before they generate the real work. Mannerists do this: take a previous idea and echo it with minor nuances, strive for an ironic mode because that looks clever. It does to the perpetrator, anyway, though the audience has already seen the con.Al Pacino said in a recent interview that he does bad movies in the hope that they might lift and, at the very least, become mediocre. With this movie he may have attained that goal, though that is no concession, or pleasure, for the rest of us.",2,3,7,23 November 2019
Gone Girl," Gone Numb
","Many of Shakespeare's plays are two and a half hours long. Some of the really great classics: Richard II, Macbeth and others that due to the complexity of character, action and language have provided audiences with psychological insight and the pure artistry of English in full flow.Then there is Gone Girl, of similar length and yet; it's capacity overwhelms its creators, it's ambitions are smug and most certainly self-satisfied. It is a long arduous, monotonous endurance of platitudes which are flecked with motifs which shimmer on the vapidness of contemporary life, yet are themselves of such shiny magazine superficiality they condemn the authors of the same mediocrity.It is over an hour before really anything of substance occurs; it breaches the protocols of the genre and taxes the humor of the viewer who are left with the wooden-faced Affleck to carry the story, occasionally interspersed with the off-screen wife.Meanwhile we are fed clichés and stereotypes on modern media, modern marriage, the asymmetry of male and female relationships all delivered with the gusto of the new college student who has just learned of these elements in adult life.The entire masquerade doggedly plugs on with the stamina of oxen ploughing a field. The characters do not change, the language in the script is common and forgettable, the pacing is akin to a stopped clock and when the final credits roll, it is almost impossible not to give up praise that time is still moving and that the potential for real life may still be possible.The easiest way to make this work is cut at least fifty minutes and it becomes, what is really is: not a very original domestic thriller and not very memorable. Making it long does not make it excellent, not when the basic material is so thin.",4,13,29,11 December 2014
Mr. Nobody," Like an advert for life assurance
","The style of photography, the close shots, the angles and the contrast are an early sign that the sensibility here is very close to advertising. At first the hyper real proximity of the image is interesting; as if, in Umberto Eco's view the perception of reality may reveal something beneath; but as the movie moves on and the rupture in the narrative becomes more glaring it is obvious that this is very bad writing and has no real sense of narrative logic or how to combine it with characterization.This film is all surface: the light, the glow and contrast of images and how lovely they look, like a fetishistic advertising campaign.The simpleness of the construction and the poverty of its ideas are present within the first act and therefore what ensues is not much more than the lame resolution of the basic premise. It has the smug contented appearance of an adverting campaign, as if all the focus group research confirmed that that what was shown has been preapproved.Play this movie at double speed on a DVD player and it is still perfectly comprehensible because there is absolutely no depth to the writing - it is all superficially obvious from the pictures.",Null,1,6,29 July 2011
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Ponderous bore
","Literally watching paint dry would be more lively that this movie.While the visual tricks and sepia are all wonderful, this film is a massively tedious failure. The characters are less alive than slabs in a mortuary and they move through the scenes like wooden props. And it's all so solemn, as if life's lessons are delivered in homily style.Benjamin Button is like Forrest Gump but with all the life, action and wit and humor sucked out of him.The reason lies with the script which has removed any action and turned it all into reaction. The script is executed in reported style, so Benjamin tells the audience what is happening, as the actors do it but without any agency. The problem is fundamental as it starts the film, with the book reading and the old woman in the bed: the story is narrated not acted. A basic lesson from film school and scriptwriting is not to make this mistake or the end product is this dull. Benjamin is not the agent of his life – things happen to him. Another lesson fro drama and script wring, the protagonist must be the agent of their own life.Due to this failure in the script the actors are all redundant – it's a novel with pictures. And ultimately the musings on life and time are just pretentious and incomplete.Go outside to a lawn, get a chair and a drink, sit down and watch the grass grow. That will say more about life and time than this movie.",3,3,5,16 April 2010
1917," Insincere
","This film proffers a realistic presentation of a WW1 battlefield and of the threats, the physical terrors, of such a place, but it is actually like a hybrid mediated version of that reality. The result is something like following an avatar in immersive game. This impression is confirmed at the film's end.When it starts the camera has the viewer in the middle of the action and immediately the cleanliness of the soldiers, their spotless uniforms, their fresh faces seem at odds with the mud and shell fire. Then their dialogue is phrased and framed around a type of theatrical form. It needn't be crude or ignorant but it conveys a polished and mannered styling of men talking.Into the action of the film, the two leads take us through the hell of Flanders with mud, rats and corpses, and as these sequences proceed it seems as if the grammar, the structure of the drama is like a multi-level game where the avatars start on one level and then move onto another encountering new places and dangers along the way. As the film progresses it becomes increasingly clear that this is the logic to the film's pacing and drama.The impression is sealed in the second half when our hero is lost in a shattered village and meets a woman - nice quiet moment in the game here - and escaping the ruins falls over a steep waterfall and lands in lush country. Where such a high waterfall is in that part of Belgium is a mystery, and then to enter a sylvan land is even more mysterious. It as if he went up to level 8 in the game.Then there is a battle scene with troops going 'over the top' while enemy shells rain down; meanwhile our hero is running as these shell bursts but do not disturb his relentless legs, nor shake the earth, never mind that the shock waves would upend a normal man.It's not Passchendaele, nor any battle front as documented, but it is like a game where you are a courier sent on a deadly mission to deliver a message before the lives of 1600 men are potentially squandered.It's not as if the film industry hasn't perpetrated a fraud with history, this one just seems more insincere than most.",4,30,61,17 January 2020
The King," Dreary
","Compared to Henry IV parts one and two and Henry V by Shakespeare this is routine drama by the numbers.It covers the material and it looks good enough but it has no spark and the pace is typical of those mainstream sword and fantasy series which are earnest and plod through its episodes.The Shakespeare originals are much better, imperfect in many ways, but packed with intrigue and politics and lots of humor, most of it not very elegant humor either.",4,20,33,2 November 2019
There Will Be Blood," Citizen Kane meets Godfather II meets boredom
","Writer-directors are a rare breed: they believe they can do most everything but in fact while they can pontificate about directing they are mostly utterly useless at the craft of writing. This is evident in this portentous bore of a film which is a metaphorical exploration of a businessman like Citizen Kane.It constantly portends to something interesting - even dramatic within a time period and between other characters - but never ever does so. Exactly like Citizen Kane this is so incompletely written that it fails to be dramatic in anyway and is another magazine article with pictures of a person's biography. It is story telling in pastiche mode.It should also be said that the music score was one of the worst ever in a major film: repetitive, annoying, misplaced with the screen action and the quotes from the classical repertoire lacked the intelligence of a Godard when does he the same thing. It was jejune.The only people who should be unfortunate enough to watch this long winded and self important piece of overstuffed film making are other writer directors.",3,2,6,12 March 2011
Stranger Than Fiction," Imitation of another work
","If ever the discrepancy between real writing and screen writing were still moot this film makes it apparent, in a script which contrives to appear quirky, self-reflective, and because it is non naturalistic, contemporary, even pushing boundaries of narrative form in film.While that may seem true to anyone who last read a book prescribed by their high school teacher, this movie is a derivative and arch work that has poached Borges, or Sterne, among others, for its motive and conceits and consequently the finished work is completely pedestrian.The banality is compounded by a layer of trite homily suitable to a youthful, if inexperienced audience, about leading an authentic life. This element might have come from the counterculture but it is then reflected through bland corporate platitudes that have the effect of trans fats on the mind.The shortcomings aside the director has done well, as has the editor, to realize the result. Likewise the actors manage quite well with the material they have, although it becomes more and more strained.How this stale, hack, script ever saw production, let alone was lauded with awards, should be a cause for some soul-searching by all concerned.",3,0,1,2 May 2015
Inception," Dazzles like cheap jewelery
","While it seems ingenious to invent a cunning conceit such as the one deployed in this film it is like a novel that uses neologisms and errant grammar and punctuation: it's effects tire and it seems less than it wishes it to be.The dramaturgy and logic of Inception is very simple and relies on a 'reductio' argument which is quite clear within 10 minutes,(and is absurd because of the logical impossibility of the argument itself like Wittgenstein's proof against skepticism) but it's true failing is not that: it is in fact the use of change and sudden effects as plot devices because once employed they heighten awe but kill any suspense or connection with the characters in the film. There is no reason or emotion in caring about characters that are chaff in a rather ordinary logician's game.Years ago Thomas Pynchon was considered an important writer, and the author and critic (and sometime film critic) Peter Ackroyd wrote an astute review of his major work, 'Gravity's Rainbow', in which he ridiculed the ease of such writing; it's deceptive cleverness; it's egoism, and its immaturity because it is so overtly obvious, and like anything childish, of no real lasting interest artistically. Inception is that too. Instantly forgettable.",3,8,12,28 May 2011
Parasite," Masterwork
","It is demonstrably an excellent film within the first 15 minutes and it gets better. It has a very good script, one which is honed with good characterization and motive, together with fine structural exposition. No other script in the 2020 Oscars has the qualities that this one has in terms of writing skill.In terms of execution, the directing and other technical components, all coalesce brilliantly. It is probably the editing too where so many remarkable films excel that lifts the film again. The sequences in the house between the families are memorable here as the tension is raised with so much at stake.The story has many layers which are relevant to this time: chiefly inequality, but also other themes too which are touched on in deft ways and through the characters so as to move the story along toward its rather terrible conclusion.
The ending is somewhat classical; a purge clarifies the entire drama, and it is effective in its own terms, but it also the only part of script that is not entirely ideal. Other choices might have been made which do not make the one we see an error.Signalling 'wokeness' is pointless with this film. It is a very good film and will be referenced by film makers and students for years to come. That durability is honor indeed.",9,17,26,10 February 2020
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Henry James in Barcelona
","Woody Allen has contrived a contemporary version of a Henry James or Edith Wharton story of Americans in Europe. Like those two great American writers it hinges on polarities. The Americans are opposite of the Europeans, in this case Spanish, it leads to humor, misunderstanding and occasionally something illuminating in the way each society behaves. It also tends to rely on cliché, a word Allen employs often as criticism, but it is present here, although it is a sophisticated cliché.Just like James and Wharton the exposition of American morals, in all spheres, and with it, a wry critique of American philistinism is engaging. Vicky is all puritan accomplishments and rational objectives; Cristina is adventurous, and as the pompous husband of Vicky says, she is contemptuous of the American bourgeois life-plan. The criticism of philistinism is apparent in the lifeless and materialistic way the American characters talk: the house they have Vicky and Doug have planned for instance, but mostly it is in the foreignness and otherness of art in Barcelona, they must acquire, possess, learn about it, it in a way that is absurd to the Spanish who live with it. The father poet of Juan Antonio who will not publish anything as an example of an artistic life lived without the materialist aim of money and book sales. It's an American stereotype of a European, which is just another but fancier cliché. And the tempestuous relationship between Juan Antonio and Maria Elena is an extended Latin stereotype that might have been taken from an olive oil commercial.The most curious feature to the film is the voice over, written with care in real prose. Again, it might have been take from James. While it adds layers to characters and insights into the drama beyond the camera, it distances the actions on-screen and betrays their motives. At the end it almost cheats the audience of what they have sat through.",6,0,4,16 January 2011
The Deer Hunter," A minor footnote
","The skill of a director, like a painter and a writer, is to be able to make the right choices: to be able to prioritize elements into balance relative with each other over the course of a movie, a book or on canvas. This makes the meaning of the artistic object stronger; it helps convey its purpose, it defines the good from the great artist with all the requisite skills.This quality is brought out in Jackson Pollock, whose works baffles and angers many as just a plane of drips of equal measure without focus or balance. This is of course utterly wrong as Pollock's work is highly structured, layered; the operating intelligence and skill forms the work.To a degree Pollock seems like a good simile to this film. It has a vast canvas, it is along work and yet it exemplifies the narrow ability, the stunted skills. For instance, real time and cinematic time are often rendered in the same way so there are many long sequences of no real value which strain interest but as they progress, rather like cinéma vérité, they intend to add to the truth of the representation but do not because the cinema is not reality. It is this essential flaw which then weighs down the entire film to the result that all the major scenes are very long, overly so, and they are given almost equal screen time, as if to articulate that all is of the same significance.This is defect is a cardinal error in an artistic work. Imagine a novel doing such a thing, the minutiae would be so enormous the writer would be crippled typing it all.It is said that in post-production Cimino could not remove sequences - that he succumbed to the basic mistake of not being able to give priority to the material. However it's not that editing could revise the movie into a tighter more engaging experience with better perspective. If that were possible it would cut the duration and truncate the material which would in all likelihood yield another 'Days of Heaven', a meandering narrative disaster itself. The fault with 'The Deer Hunter' lies in the script, it has everything tossed into it: friendship, love, war, ethnic culture, the US; the list goes on and on, and with all that it its architecture is riddled with dry rot.The result is monotonous, pompous, rambling and inevitable.Not even the technical qualities can salvage something despite excellent photography, and the sense of place and location is very good too, as are the performances from a major cast; and yet, the most important decisions about balance and proportion were not made because those that should have known how to do it had no skill. This deficit would be demonstrated in the subsequent work.",3,4,7,13 April 2015
Her," Needs defragging
","Like a computer with 8Mb of memory and a 33Mhz processor this moves so slowly and deliberately that it is predictable.It starts very promisingly but gradually descends, or stutters, into Gen-Y speak; dialog and scenes of relationship clichés that have been played over and over, with each character mouthing (and that includes the OS voices too) the same platitudes.The movie has the emotional depth of a late teen piece; something that a young adult might have scratched out from their experiences of school and the misadventures of a young relationship. Too often it settles for mawkish mewling and also proves the axiom that watching other people falling in love is dull, even with software code, especially when they say such uninteresting things to each other.It does have a good idea but the execution is disappointing and repetitive.The metaphor of an operating system having the qualities of a woman is curious. The technical inaccuracy is too easy to take apart for its own sake. No doubt if Microsoft had developed this everyone would have wanted the old Win 7 version, with the more familiar buttons and who could blame them, because an OS is meant to be predictable, not emotional and not offering simulated sex. What part of the end user license agreement is that?If someone comes along and picks up the themes in this and develops it into a stronger piece, they may have a convincing and engaging film.",4,39,77,1 February 2014
Macbeth," Fatuous
","While the strongest features of this version: the locations, photography and production design, are quite outstanding the overall impression is less than memorable. It is afflicted by a meddling director, changes that serves little purpose or revelation in the end, and all the normal problems of cinematic adaptations of Shakespeare.A major defect is the music which constantly scrapes – telling us that all things are seething with malignancy. It does, however strain the nerves like a dentist's drill, and is just as annoying. In essence that is the flaw with the whole thing, and certainly the first hour which is dour and dreary, though not in a good way because it's so simplistically portentous and saved only by the scenery and the light.The actors manage quite well, even if they speak in a very mannered sotto voce. In itself this is a weakness as it leads through most of the film to a vocal range that is very narrow. This pitch is evident between Macbeth and his wife as though all relationships are marked by the same register and it is necessarily identical between all parties. Paradoxically this approach leads Macbeth to be nearly unchanged from the beginning to the end, which is not how the play deals with the character. The important 'Tomorrow' soliloquy is rendered lame by the continuity of the low voice which preceded it and so this speech is no different to the rest.The typical problem of all cinematic adaptations of Shakespeare is apparent here. The two forms, poetic drama and cinema are anathema to each other. The former requires words and once they are edited it's not Shakespeare but an etiolated revision, replaced by montage and glances; which compared to a great text, are of very little consequence. Kurosawa's Throne of Blood was another prism by which to see this drama but it was only cognate in the same plot and story, not the language, and stands in the same way as his superb Ran is to King Lear.There are several film versions of this play and now there are more filmed staged versions to view and to compare. This particular version looks quite pointless by comparison. It has made some changes, cut some parts, removed the small portion of vulgar humor which relieved the glowering doom, but in the end, it is rather fatuous.",4,22,34,20 January 2016
The Great Gatsby," Slick
","Imagine if one day Michael Bay, famous for the high action epic movie, decided to remake the Ingmar Bergman trilogy. It would be full of cuts and grand scenes and instead of muted verbal clashes there would be fist fights. Of course the camera would be so restless as to give a sense of vertigo and the scene transitions would be rapid.Clearly a mismatch of talent and purpose, It's the same thing here with a shallow meaningless idiotic version that only shows how little the writing team and the director understood the material. The defense would be that it works for the current generation. And that may be true if weren't such a meretricious irrelevant argument. It is a travesty to update something out of recognition, as perhaps a Bay version of any Ingmar Bergman film would be.In a way it has to be slick; that is to be a massive sleight of hand, in order to conceal any genuine working or interpretation with the material. This is shock and awe but once the deceit is recognized it's clear that it is really just junk - expensive enough to erase reason for a minute or two, but junk all the same.A real director would have made something of the very simple material; it is a very slight piece of prose after all, but that requires maturity and expertise to interpret, and in its place, are the grandiose visions of a music video director from 1984.",1,9,15,27 September 2013
Up in the Air," Very good but with one big flaw
","This movie has many good and surprising features, notably, an ambiguous ending. Indeed the ambivalent approach infuses the entire story, underwritten in the ironic tone, the slight mocking of corporate language. A real strength are the direct to camera cameos of the people who have been 'let go', never fired. They tell the contemporary storyof America, and are a countervailing force against Clooney's cool, even smug, but perfect detachment. Having praised it, there is, however, one major flaw and it's a character and plot flaw which may be in the source book. Alex, yes, just wonderful as played by Vera Farmiga, is however badly written. While the affair is playful it deepens when they visit Wisconsin for a weekend wedding. The audience believes along with Clooney's character that this signifies a real real bond between them. It does not and for devastating reasons. The first time I watched the movie I could almost accept why, but the second time I could not because for it to work it demanded that Alex be a sociopath i.e. betray other people to seek her own pleasure. A sociopath is plausible - but works against the theme of the latter half of the film, if she is. Not good writing. So,if she is not a sociopath, it is a poor piece of plotting. It is a significant weakness in another wise, very good film.",8,1,3,27 March 2010
