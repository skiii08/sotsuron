The King's Speech," Everything in its place, but...
","' Kings's Speech', winner of numerous awards, great cast of superb English actors, amazing skill in re-enacting the bygone era, and so on , so on... Everything is in its place, every detail thought through, the story itself mesmerizing, but... What was missing is a spark of originality, a dash of madness, a dab of anarchy. It is hard to put your finger on it, but it was all just far too predictable for my taste. Mind you, I enjoyed the movie immensely. British actors play the history better than anybody in the world, their classical training shows in every sentence they pronounce. Perhaps, when people praise the piece of art you expect to be awed and blown away, and I wasn't. It could be my fault. Who knows...",7,2,3,21 November 2011
Black Swan," Mediocre
","' Black Swan' is what happens when Hollywood pretends to be independent. Mediocre script, filled with the simplifications and stereotypes, quirky camera work and decent, but not fabulous acting -it just about sums it all up. Why is it so difficult to have an original idea? There are tens of thousands of creative young people with fresh thinking and clear heads. There are so many good actors that never get a single chance to show what they are made of. Instead failed models and pretty people without anything to offer pretend to act. It works for several years and than they fade away dazed like deer caught in headlights. This is not a bad movie or horrible acting. This is just mediocre, trivial dumbed down little flick. Oscar??? It's a joke.",6,1,2,25 July 2011
Child 44," Dark and Hopeless
","The drab grayness and squalor of Stalin Russia. Seen before, but so what? That is not a real problem with this movie. Lack of originality is not a cardinal sin. But everything else, just plain silly accents, manic desire to outdo the horror with ever worse horror of that monstrous political system and just unforgivable lack of subtlety. Even in this hellish place at that hellish time must've been, at least a detail that could lighten their miserable lives. If everything was as dark and hopeless , why the complete population of Soviet Union didn't commit a collective suicide. They just had to, there was no other way. Hollywood again kills a good book and makes it into nothing. Quite a feat.",6,6,10,20 October 2015
Argo," No Surprise
","There are mixed feelings about this engaging flick. To start, this is a competent, well executed ( and I am not talking about historical accuracy)thriller, with an able cast of mostly good character actors. It does convey the explosive atmosphere of the early Islamic Revolution, perhaps little one-sided , but still... The real trouble starts with the Oscars, and the Hollywood money machine. Is this the best picture made last year? I sincerely hope not. If it is, lets just close the doors to lofty proclamations, and just be entertained. I did enjoy watching this movie, and found myself thinking that it is better than I expected. But, does this little confession of mine make it a masterpiece? Oh, no, not in thousand years. Money, as usual rules. Promotions, agencies, right connections, aggressive advertising, that's what is all about. A healthy dash of simpleton patriotism, twisting of the facts in favor of CIA, and nobody gets offended and too distressed. Almost nobody. There are few people left who do get offended with the predictable lack of bold creativity. But then who cares about few curmudgeons and killjoys.",7,0,0,6 October 2013
The Secret in Their Eyes," Regret
","'The Secret in their Eyes' is a sad and precious story about wasted lives and regrets.Its plot travels between 1974 and 1999, from the time of dictatorship to the time of democracy. Argentina , like the most of South America went through turbulent upheaval in the 60's and 70's. The Cold War and its protagonists were spreading their macabre influence all over the world. If you weren't with them, you were against them. The simple tragic murder and rape of a young schoolteacher took a back seat to military junta's fight for survival. That act of criminal injustice affected three lives.This is a powerful, touching movie colored with pastel colors of regret and loss.",9,1,2,3 January 2011
Black Book," Missed opportunity
","World War II was a subject of countless movies. From ideological, propaganda rubbish to some of the best masterpieces ever made. If you decide to make a movie set in those times today, it is absolutely necessary to have a novel idea. This, quite well done and entertaining movie, doesn't have anything new to tell us. It is made in Hollywood mode, meaning thrills and turns and twists and not very much logic or character development. The horror of the war is barely touched upon, and even violence and death seem cleaned up not to disturb the modern viewer too much.It is a mystery to me how anybody can try to brings us back to those days of immense suffering and fail to touch us for a single moment. ' The Black Book' is a mixture of brilliant technique and lack of things to say.",6,0,5,24 December 2009
Hot Fuzz," Good and Smart
","It is very hard to make a good comedy, but to make good and smart comedy takes a real genius. ' Hot Fuzz' is a brilliant parody on both Hollywood action nonsense and the cozy village fairytale. The two, at first sight incompatible ingredients, mash beautifully in this hilariously funny movie. Fanatical, by the book city cop gets transferred into a picturesque green paradise, full of dimwits. Add a generous sprinkle of strange deaths, murders masked as accidents and it's a winning proposition. What makes this comedy stand out is a marvelous dead pan that it's played with. The first class cast plays these part as seriously as they would perhaps 'Macbeth'. That level of conviction gives the movie that extra punch and wins your heart while you exercise your laughing muscles.",9,0,0,12 February 2014
Orphan," One word-moronic
","There comes a point when people should be banned from making movies. When you make an atrocity like 'Orphan', there is no redemption. I really don't know where to start. Maybe with rich, endlessly irritating main characters who deserve whatever they got, or with the plot that has hole after hole and nothing to show for it. Or even better, sickening flirtation with child pornography,and mindless, suspense less violence. People are entitled to make a mistake or make a bad, even awful movie. What they are not entitled to, is this perverse exercise in pushing the boundaries without consequences. This is a shameful piece of garbage not even worth a second glance.",1,24,53,3 January 2011
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Stunning movie-making
","Cold war, the Iron Curtain, spies and traitors, cats and mice, and it is sometimes hard to tell who is who. These are the different kind of crazy 70's, not so much sex, drugs and rock and roll, more dark rooms, swilling whiskey, drab man in drab offices, painting world in the color of blood. It is all shrouded in patriotic colors and high ideals of God and country ( strangely how nothing changed since), but in harsh reality it is all about power, control and backstabbing in the lofty corridors of rulers of the realm. John Le Carre reinvented the modern spy novel. No more buxom blonds and car chases. Just gloomy corners, musty hotel rooms and the rancid smell of betrayal. This is stunning movie-making, and a lesson in classy acting.Precious gift these days.",10,1,2,15 October 2012
Pan's Labyrinth," Fairy-tale for adults
","This haunting, beautiful fairy-tale for adults, deservedly won the Oscar for the best foreign movie. In the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War, fascists are seeking revenge and young girl desperately tries to escape the daily horrors of her existence.Her mother is heavily pregnant, and her sadistic stepfather spreads evil around him. Mr. Del Toro made such an original and stunning movie. This powerful metaphor about the eternal battle between good and evil warms our hearts and freezes our blood in the same time. The incredible extremes of courage and horror that human beings are capable of, never seem to surprise us and touch us deeply. Don't miss this masterpiece. They are not easy to come by.",9,2,9,27 July 2009
The Book Thief," Trite and Predictable
","There is a waterfall of fantastic reviews for this flick. Of course, it is perfectly fine. We all have different tastes. One's treasure could be someone else's junk. I found this movie to be trite and predictable, typical feel good Hallmark TV movie. All those ridiculous German accents ( with an occasional German word snuck in), all these million times chewed upon saccharine sweet messages, that everybody enjoys, but nobody takes seriously. And, above all not a single one original idea, even a sentence. So, if you like a bit of kitsch, nicely colored, wrapped in shiny paper, knock yourself out. You could do worse. Or many times better.",4,3,5,25 September 2015
Coriolanus," Human Tragedy
","Heroes and politicians, two remarkably different breeds. The first, fight bravely and spill blood, and the second, send them to do the dirty deed and despise them for being what they made them to be. And so Caius Martius ,courageous and conceited, enters the politics and quickly sinks in the quicksand of the foul swamps of populism. Ralph Fiennes in his directing debut, sets this classic play in some troubled, presumably Balkan nation, and in modern time. Many have tried that novelty, but here it is not a gimmick but the statement that nothing new happens in this world. If we only picked up a dusty history book from a long forgotten shelf, we might have avoided a war or two. But, then there is a lot of money to be made in human tragedy. Nothing pays better than tears and despair. Not our own, of course, but in some other unimportant land. Far away and easy not to pay attention to, almost as easy as for politicians to ignore heroes. Blood stains and Armani suits never go together, although they are never far from each other.",9,0,3,3 November 2013
The Orphanage," Love, grief and loss
","There are not very many good ghost stories these days. That seems to be a thing of the past. Movie makers of today are more prone to blowing things up or ripping body parts, like that really scares anybody. Every day on the news is more disturbing then any horror movie in our theaters. This beautiful movie is an exception. Filmed in warm, hazy shapes, with realistic characters that everyone can relate to. It doesn't scare you in obvious ways of less talented directors. ' The Orphanage' grabs you and makes your heart flutter. And in the same time wraps you in a blanket of sadness.Love, grief and an incredible loss, three faithful companions. Lovely, touching movie that gets you under its spell.",9,1,2,2 July 2008
Salt," Dumb propaganda garbage
","Would someone, please tell Hollywood idiots that the Cold War is over for over two decades. I mean really guys... This disjointed nonsense of a thriller is just plain idiotic. The silly leading characters with her barely 100 pounds of bones and ligaments can kick ass and injure or kill men twice her size, without forgetting to purse her lips in every close-up. How do you come up with this nothing but dumb propaganda garbage filled with 70's clichés. Russians are all drunk and speak with moronic accent. When you make your potential enemy silly and ineffective, you only succeed to make yourself inept and foolish.For that Hollywood moguls never needed help, they are naturals.",3,1,4,27 March 2011
The White Ribbon," Compelling art
","Michael Haneke, one of perhaps the most gifted directors of our times, made a compelling piece of art. His movies are all but predictable and repetitive. 'The White Ribbon' is a an incredible treatise on nature of evil and seductive power of violence. Small German village, year before bloody World War I, full of hard working and seemingly civilized people,turns into a dangerous place, where ugliness lurks at every corner. Amazing black and white cinematography gives powerful imagery. People with subdued emotions that eerily get expressed in a same black and white way. This is one of the most impressive movies I've seen in last 5 years. I firmly believe this will be a classic.",10,1,3,14 January 2011
District 9," Humankind
","'District 9' is not your average sci-fi flick.Grant it, there are aliens, there is a gigantic space ship, unidentifiable weaponry, but even so there is so much more. We look upon the possible visitors from outer space as mortal danger, but what if we, the humankind, are the real danger. After all, we decimated our own planet, we fight bloody, useless wars, mostly for profit or base revenge, we can excuse any kind of atrocity with lofty nationalist or religious idea. So, is it such an improbability that the aliens are the real victims, and humans real villains? Well not to me at least. I've been around long enough to be surprised by anything.",8,0,1,29 October 2012
Unknown," It Is What It Is
","It is not an easy task to write a review about this thriller. Thriller by it's definition needs to get you involved swiftly, grab you by the throat and hold, till the amazing and unforgettable finish. So by that measure this a very successful flick. There are car chases, people jumping back and forth, quite a number of dead people etc... Of course none of this makes any sense whatsoever. You could poke thousand holes per minute if you were so inclined. But, to what purpose? The filmmakers didn't lie nor misrepresent themselves. It is what it is. Liam Neeson, a very talented actor, suffers from the same ailment that any reluctant action hero does. Too busy running and ducking to act. Fortunately we have marvelous veterans Frank Langella and even more Bruno Ganz. Smart director knows that he needs little meat on this movie's bones.",7,2,2,9 March 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Smart thriller
","One of the greatest sensations in the last decade of the mystery writing are three rich, thick novels written by Steig Larsson, Sweedish reporter who unfortunately, soon after giving his books to the publisher, passed away at the age of 50 from heart attack. These novels are a special treat. They contain all the required norms of the successful mystery, but they are much more than that. They are the witness to the increasing complexity of the mad world we live and suffer in.His characters possess the rare richness and truthfulness. They are brave and scared, good and evil or all of the above in the right situation.This movie gives justice to the remarkable legacy of the far to soon gone writer of rare talent and integrity.",9,2,4,7 March 2011
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," original approach
","Horrible fate of the European Jews during the Second World War was a subject of many movies. The unique horror of their plight, breaks our hearts and eternally stays in our memories as a warning for the days to come. Director Mark Herman has an original approach to this tragedy. The genocide and atrocities seen through eyes of a child, the son of the commander of the camp. There are no blood and acts of unspeakable cruelty on the screen. Nevertheless, we are horrified, feeling in our bones the ensuing tragic end.The ' New York Times' film critic seems took a personal affront that movie is devoid of blood, feces and sweat.In my opinion, the images that are in our minds, far outweigh the graphics.",8,2,3,24 June 2009
The Dark Knight," Great performance
","I have to admit that I am not a big fan of comic-book movies. The main reason that I decided to watch ' The Dark Knight' was my deep respect for Heath Ledger and his rare talent. While the movie surprised me with creativity and spark of originality, it is the performance of the late actor that will stay with me. Brilliant, manic and more than slightly demented energy of his character was just a right fit for this bleak and disturbing film.In a strange way it symbolizes the weird and unpredictable times we live in. The rules are rapidly changing, and none of us is sure anymore what might befall us next. Here comes Mr. Ledger's Joker as a twisted prophet of the future madness that could become the norm for survival.",7,0,2,21 July 2009
Taken," Surprise
","To be completely honest, the only reason that I even considered watching this movie is Liam Neeson. His incredible talent was woefully underused in American movies.But, then everybody's talent gets a short shrift when idiots run the industry. Even the plot of this flick is cliché ridden. Hero's family is in peril and he singlehandedly destroys all the evil enemies with little or no damage to himself.And, then a surprise. ' Taken' is not going to win awards for originality, its forte is unusually gritty and ruthless hero,on avenge of a sociopath and the seedy, sordid atmosphere that grabs the viewer by the throat and doesn't let go till the end. Entertaining but disturbing thriller. Its nice to be surprised.",8,0,0,6 September 2010
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," Brilliant movie
","Ken Loach might be a self-proclaimed socialist( and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that in my mind), but he is, in the same time, one of the best directors in Great Britain. ' Wind That Shakes the Barley' is a strong indictment of war and bloodshed and the shameful British involvement in Ireland. The nation that invented ethnic cleansing and committed numerous act of genocide all over the world, was trying to teach a lesson in justice and peace in the Balkans. It would be funny if it wasn't tragic.But that's a different story. This brilliant movie, filmed perfectly and with one of the best casts I ever saw, strikes a right note and leads us slowly through British oppression to Irish civil war.From crime to tragedy.",10,2,3,30 April 2012
There Will Be Blood," Clinically cold
","This movie awakens mixed feelings. In the abysmal state of the now days American cinematography, we should applaud and praise with unrestrained joy any spark of creativity and artistic courage. And as much as I am in dire need of applauding and rejoicing, I have some serious quibbles with this movie.' There will be blood', the epic about oil, money, and religion as defining powers of American history, should've been a powerhouse of passion and gut-wrenching emotion. Alas, this movie is slow, aloof and clinically cold. Its characters don't seem to this viewer as larger than life figures as they had to be to survive the conditions they lived in. They seem more like timid lab rats awaiting next horror that life might impose upon them.Things happen to them instead of making things happen for them. And that is when it all loses its allure. Imperfect movie of a very talented director. Still eons away from average Hollywood dross. Thanks for that.",7,0,2,25 August 2008
The Conjuring," Old-fashioned spine- chiller
","These days it is harder to find a good horror movie than be a presidential candidate. The amount of sheer dross is staggering. 'The Conjuring' is really an old-fashioned ghost/possession spine-chiller. There is an innocent family and not so innocent house in, of course, New England (where else?). Peaceful countryside, rickety old house with appropriate noises, and the vengeful former inhabitants. And all of this could have so easily slipped into the bad symphony of clichés, but for a steady hand of a smart movie director named James Wan. With a right amount of old, reliable tricks, but put together with fresh hands, it gives a jolly good scare. The only blemish is ever so sweetened ending in an old moronic Hollywood tradition. God forbid something doesn't get neatly wrapped up. That would be the end of the silly world we know.",8,1,2,20 December 2015
Valkyrie," Appalling acting of Tom Cruise
","I have to start this review with an honest confession. I think that Tom Cruise is an appalling actor, with laughable technique, minute personality and no talent whatsoever. There I said it. Then why see this movie? First I am an history buff, and secondly the marvelous cast of brilliant British actors, trying their best to support a man that earns 50 times more and can't act to save his life. The movie itself is a well done, above average caper. We all knew that Hitler wasn't assassinated, but the story kept our attention, and even managed to be somewhat suspenseful. Still, this is a sad example of a mediocre Hollywood star, one of many one trick ponies, looking pathetic in a company of great but under-respected peers.",6,1,1,18 November 2009
