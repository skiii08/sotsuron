Black Swan," Much better than expected
","Black Swan definitely succeeds as a psychological thriller. In many regards, it is absolutely great movie. An excellent approach to personality distortion and self-destruction. When obsession absorbs everything inside you, your worst enemy reveals itself on a mirror.
The inner conflict and insanity of Natalie Portman's character 'Nina' is amazing to witness.
Natalie Portman did an amazing performance here, transforming physically and mentally to get into the character. I am not surprised that she got an oscar. After watching this, i consider myself a Natalie Portman fan.",9,1,1,13 December 2018
Jackie," Superb acting
","Jackie shows the assassination and aftermath through Jacqueline Kennedy's eyes. The screenplay is not good enough but Natalie Portman is phenomenal, completely engaging and makes this movie more watchable. Portman is acting Jackie's mannerisms skillfully but more importantly, you can understand each character's complexities and sadness. The movie is worth seeing just for her. It was great to see John Hurt again at the same time.",8,0,0,20 December 2018
Her," Unique
","Another movie that i say 'i should've watched before'. Intense romantic drama. Fascinating portrait of loneliness in a post-digital world. Amazingly original screenplay, concept, musics, especially colors and performance from Joaquin Phoenix. This made me stay with myself after the credits have finished, i found myself reflecting on my own life and relationships.",10,203,217,17 April 2018
