The King's Speech," MAsterpiece
","Firth's performance is by far the best of the time. It deserved 4 Oscars and more. I thoroughtly enjoyed this film, now 8 years old (hard to believe). 
Worth a look if you haven't seen!",8,0,0,7 October 2018
No Country for Old Men," Decent
","It's not Coen brothers' best film, but it's decent. The plot was not so appealing. The bad guy's weapon was both intriguing and shocking when used. It's an uncomfortable film to watch when you don't know when Bardem is going to lose it.",7,0,0,7 October 2018
Men in Black II," Ok
",It's not MIB 1- which was incomparable in many ways. The humour wasn't as hard hitting and the aliens were not as compelling to watch. Definitely can give this a miss unless you were a die-hard MIB 1 fan.,6,0,0,6 October 2018
