Moneyball," Moneyball is A Grand Slam
",NOW THIS IS A BASEBALL MOVIE! If you don't know anything about baseball GO SEE 'MONEYBALL'. The director clearly showed why baseball is an American game. This film has a picture perfect cast. With Mr.Pitt leading off. The Cimatorophy was great and well blended. The score of the film was good and well thought out. If you are a baseball fan then this one is for you.*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* Moneyball is about Billy Bean who is head of the Oakland Athletics in 2002. Who after losing key players needs to re-amp his team. The scoots have been doing the same thing for decades and Bean wants to try something new. He comes across Peter B. played by Johan Hill who really showed he could do more then just comedy. Billy takes Peter under his wing and help him create a winning team with the money the team has. To try and change the game that has been done the same way for over a century.I like how the movie shows archive footage of the actual 2002 season during the film.,10,0,2,27 February 2012
Skyfall," SkyFall takes us back to Original bond
","'SkyFall' gives a masterful applause and showing for Bond fans around the world. Ian Flemingand Albert 'Cubby' Broccoli would be proud of Sam Mendes 'SkyFall' if they were around today.For the 23 BOND film and 50 years of Bond Barbra Broccoli has given us along with Sam a classic Bond film with twist. That ranks with Dr. NO, GOLDFINGER , AND MORE. So grab a Vesper Martini and raise your glass to one of the best Bonds in the franchise. Cheers for more Bond's to come. For now this is Bond, James Bond saying so long for now and I'll see you in BOnd 24.",8,4,13,12 November 2012
The Hunger Games," Hollywood 'Ruined Another'
",Let me start off by saying the casting was really good but thats the only thing good about 'Hunger Games'. The director and others took major key plot points/characters out of the book. For instance the Avox girl who in the books plays a pivotal part with Katness and the capital. Also they took out how Katness really got the Mockingjay pin and why the capital and President Snow are so evil. I also didn't like how they made this feel like the next teenage girl twilight movie trilogy. The Twilight movies sucked too and now since twilight series is ending Hollywood has gone and ruined a great book so they can bring in the crazed teenage girls to watch a movie that probably some have not even read. I was very disappointed with the movie and thought they put no effort what so ever into making 'Hunger Games' into what it really could have been. A great book series one of my favorites turned into a disappointing and uneventful movie.,6,4,4,1 May 2012
Drive," 'Drive' felt like those old 80's movies
",'Drive' was a pulse power adrenaline rush thrill ride. That never let go of the gas petal. This movie felt like an 80's style movie. Which is really rare for this time and age in movies. Ryan was great. A real up an coming Hollywood star in my opinion. The feel of the movie was so dramatically different from everything thats been out. The score of 'Drive' was spot on. The opening song 'Tick of the Clock' made me know this was my movie. This actor has big things in the future so Hollywood better watch out.Ryan is also in 'The Ides of March' haven't seen it yet but want too. Heard it was good.,8,1,3,26 February 2012
Gladiator," 'What we do in Film, Echoes in Audience'
","This is my favorite film of all time. I live by the line 'Brothers, What we do in Life,Echoes in Eternity'. Gladiator has a message to it. Yes, almost all films haves messages in them but not all have a sentimental feel to the film.Ridley Scott did a wonderful job directing old Rome as best he could. The Colosseum was wonderfully reanimated. Also the actors/actress were very well casted. Crowe as Maximus gave one of the best performances of his acting career I think an Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus was very good at making me hate him.Gladiator is a film that brings us to our feet. When Crowe's character Maxumus says the line about his son and mother you cant help but cheer him on. This film is a film that gives meaning to film making. Movies like Gladiator which have great film making and character depth,love,and more stand in a Field all there own.For me Gladiator goes with films like Jaws, The Breakfast Club, and Inseption.'GLADIATOR' the score is amazingly well done and i think flawless. So is the picture.",10,1,3,2 May 2012
