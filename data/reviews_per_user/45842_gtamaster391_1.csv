Requiem for a Dream," Simply Amazing
","This is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. It evoked emotions in me that I never even knew I had. The film is raw and unforgiving and powerful performances by the entire cast make it an instant classic.The final scenes of the film have stayed with me for many years and I will never forget them.In fact I cried hysterically at the end and I never cry from films.It was so powerful that after I finished watching it I just sat down for like an hour to contemplate life. The subject matter is also extremely relevant and is very truthful to today's world of crime, drugs, and sex. This movie is absolutely sensational, a definite must see for anyone who just loves movies.",10,1,2,29 June 2006
