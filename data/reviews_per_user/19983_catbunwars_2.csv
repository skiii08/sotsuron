Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Call me crazy, but.........
","I don't believe this movie deserves the praise it is receiving. I saw the film a few days ago, with very high expectations. I had heard about this movie nearly half a year ago, and after seeing the preview I knew that I HAD to see this movie. Amongst my group of friends, I was the only one who had heard of this movie a long time before it's release. It was my idea to go see the movie because my friends had only heard of it a few days before the release.Near the beginning, I was laughing my ass off. Cohen performs as Borat perfectly, and at times he is extremely amusing. But, near the end of this film I began to grow weary of the constant crude jokes and sexual references. Don't get me wrong, I'm as tolerant of crude humor as the next guy (I love films like Austin Powers, Bruce Almighty, Anchorman, 40 Year Old Virgin, etc.). But this film is simply over the top. It achieves its goal in attempting to become one of the most crude and disgusting films made to this day, but overall it's just an excuse to show two men with too much pubic hair rubbing their balls in each others faces. After a certain scene, I stopped laughing completely. It had become too much for me to bear.Plus, I have reason to believe that this film is receiving most of its praise because of the social commentary on American life. Yes there are problems with America (PLENTY of them), but I don't want to have these issues shoved in my face, especially when they are over exaggerated, particularly about racism and hate in the south. Being born and raised in the south, I have come to hate the redneck regime that reigns supreme in this region, but to display the entire region as feeling this way is simply ridiculous. There are intelligent people here, and were not all just a bunch of yokels who hate everyone but white people. Geez, there's racism everywhere people, not just in the south.Overall, Borat is a funny film, but enough is enough, and I could've done without some of the humor in this film.",5,4,12,6 November 2006
Casino Royale," Purely amazing. I'm speechless.
","Sean Connery. George Lazenby. Roger Moore. Timothy Dalton. Pierce Brosnan. They have NOTHING on Daniel Craig.This film is nothing short of spectacular. The action, dialog, love scenes, the characters, everything: perfect. It's all very different from what we've come to expect of our hero Mr. Bond. The film series has undergone a very gigantic change. Is change a good thing? Yes, in this case I believe it is. Some viewers can't accept change. Yes, James Bond is very cold and heartless at points. Yes, he IS driving a ford focus near the beginning. Yes, he does crash his Astin Martin car very quickly (one that contains no evident gadgetry by the way). Yes, he does seem like a very VERY different Bond. But you have to consider one thing here: this movie is the story of James Bond and his first mission as a double 0. He's a little rough around the edges. He has to find his groove. Were any of you perfect on the first day of YOUR job? Aren't you better at it now? The truth is, this is a welcomed installment into a series that was beginning to get horribly worn out in the first place (hint hint, every Bond film that Pierce Brosnan starred in, except for Goldeneye which was also directed by Martin Campbell, the director of this film). It's kind of like License to Kill (one of my favorite Bond films). That film was very different in the sense that Bond took on the role of somewhat of a vigilante after his license to kill was revoked. I loved the change of pace in that film. I also loved it in this one. Seriously, think about it. Typical Bond film: Opening action scene; title song; more action; brief explanation of a villain and plot; more action; sex scene; more plot development; action; more sex; action; big showdown between Bond and the main villain where the bad guy is killed in an interesting and unique way.I don't know about you, but I was getting sick of watching film after film that followed this formula. Thank you Daniel Craig for being the best Bond yet. Thank you Martin Campbell for directing a truly wonderful film.ONE SMALL PROBLEM: NO R. I would have liked to see one of those famous comic relief scenes in which R shows Bond the new gadgets.But hey, do we REALLY need him? This film is perfect otherwise. I believe John Cleese wouldn't fit into this new style of Bond film making.Yay Daniel Craig. You were great in Munich, you were great in Layer Cake, and you were spectacular in Casino Royale.",10,2,5,19 November 2006
