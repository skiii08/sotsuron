The Blair Witch Project," A good idea, maybe a noble effort, that just didn't work
","I will try to stay as positive as I can with this. When I watched the film, what I saw was a movie about a few kids running around in the woods with video cameras being totally spontaneous trying to make a movie. They seemed to be making a movie about trying to make a movie. It didn't come across to me as a real film.The Blair Witch folks may have had a good idea, I honestly don't know, Maybe in their hearts and souls they thought what they had was a good idea; but they simply didn't have the skills to pull it off or to execute it well.As with any other art form, freedom and spontaneity are all good and well, but they must be tempered with skill, control and compromise. This involves some mastery of the craft; many years of study and experience. Maybe some day they will make a film I would like to watch.Making money, being famous and getting over on people is not what it's all about. Be damn good at what you do; that's what really matters.",1,2,4,14 April 2005
