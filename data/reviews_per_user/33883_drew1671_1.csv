Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," NyQuil
","A lover of 4, 5, & 6, this one is boring.First time I watch with my boys, I fell asleep 4 times. Same thing tonight 2 years later. Was not tired before it began. Liam's voice is too grand for lame dialog. I am convinced that these movies use weird voices to hide meaningless dialog. Sorry for bad review. I wanted to like the movie. Another problem is that the acting is sub-par. Well, I guess that with a script that is sub-par, what can actors do. Even Samuel Jackson looks lost and stiff with this terrible script. I was hoping that the second time through would be a family bonding moment with my boys, but I woke up 4 times to them laughing at my snoring!",1,1,4,14 March 2014
