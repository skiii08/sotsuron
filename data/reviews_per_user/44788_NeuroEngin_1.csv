Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A great beginning...
","One of the most underrated films in recent years, Phantom Menace is 2 hours of crazy, over-the-top Star Wars bliss.  To me, Episode One is Lucas's version of one of those great old Ray Harryhausen Sinbad movies.  So don't be a whiner!  See this movie and enjoy it!",10,4,8,22 November 2001
