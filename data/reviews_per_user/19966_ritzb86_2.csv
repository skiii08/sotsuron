Requiem for a Dream," BRUTAL..REALISTIC..MESMERIZING...pure injustice not giving it any Oscar
","first, i m not going to suggest that this is a must-see film..i don't know how every people will react to this film.this is a heart-breaking.if any one like to be punched hard & mentally tormented then this movie is for them. The max share of credit goes to ARONOFSKY, man what a movie!!!apart from the stunning acting of ELLEN BURSTYN & JENNIFER CONNELLY all belong to the director no doubt..i don't know why no one(in other comments)mentioned the musical effect of this movie...the theme music & background score give it a high no doubt..after schindler's list this movie make me feel bad,make me cry.. finally i ll say another thing: the title & specially the word REQUIEM..literally it means prayer for the one who is dead..how our addiction can make us dead during our life-span is the concept of this awesome movie",10,1,2,11 July 2008
WALLÂ·E," it will make you cry,never experienced before something like WALL-E
","Initially i want 2 thanks PIXAR for making such a cinematic history.they started it with 'TOY STORY' & 'FINDING NEMO' but 'WALL-e' is a total different class.the most beautiful thing is that it ll never make u realize that u r actually watching a high-end animated motion pictures but it makes u feel something EARTHY.this movie goes deep into my mind with its subtle touch of romance along with sweet,little,cute animation....and more over this movie have sum message 2 deliver!!!! actually when the movie ended ,i remain seated for 15 minutes;my heart don't want 2 leave the screen,craving for more.wanted 2 spend some more time with my new buddy WALL-E.surely this is no ordinary.perfect,amazing,'extra ordinar-e'",10,0,2,20 October 2008
