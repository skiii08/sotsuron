The Avengers," Added to my dumb movies list
","I will keep this short and brief:The plot was paper thin, the characters used cheesy lines which dragged the movie out, and the special effects compensated for the former flaws. The movie basically shows that consumers are dumb enough to actually rate a movie high, like the rating is, simply because enough special effects where thrown in their faces to distract from the awful parts.To footnote, only a few directors have actually been able to write and direct their own movie properly and with much success. Joss Whedon is not one of them.",5,8,20,28 May 2012
