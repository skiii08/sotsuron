3:10 to Yuma," While not a terrible movie....
","...it ain't all that great either. Nice photography, great acting, it's fairly entertaining, but the story? I guess you've got to expect a certain amount of unbelievability in a Western, such as people running through a town with dozens of people firing on them and they don't get shot. What really bothered me was the almost surreal stupidity of the guys transporting a dangerous prisoner. His only restraint was having his hands loosely cuffed in front of him. The first night he kills one of his guards. So you'd think maybe they'd add a few ropes and chains to limit his movement. Nope, they just carry on like nothing happened. Next day he kills another one. Same reaction. Later he escapes and steals all their horses. I was shaking my head in disbelief.If a bad guy offered me $200 to kill a good guy I'd be thinking 'hmm, well he's probably got a lot more than $200 in his pocket, so maybe I'll just kill this guy and take his money'.The last movie I watched because of the over 8.0 rating on IMDb was King Kong, but don't worry, this movie doesn't suck nearly as badly as King Kong.",7,1,2,15 October 2007
The Adventures of Tintin," just OK
","Knowing that Spielberg and Jackson were involved I expected the animation to be at a level not seen before - and it was. But I feared that the storytelling would be mediocre - and it was. You just wish these guys who can pour unfathomable sums of money into a film could make it a little more engaging. I guess showering a screenwriter with gold coins ain't necessarily gonna pay off the way pouring money into the animation would. Kung Fu Panda is the only animated film I've seen with a good script, wish there were more. But this was OK and I actually wouldn't object to a sequel. Kung Fu Panda good, Tintin not so good. 10 lines yet?",6,0,0,25 February 2012
