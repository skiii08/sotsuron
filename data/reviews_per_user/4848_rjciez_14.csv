Despicable Me 2," Solid Fun!
","Before going to watch 'Despicable Me 2' I was afraid that the minions were not going to be as much fun as in the first one (since the surprise factor of the first one was gone, and I kind of knew what to expect). I was wrong, they still caused laughs in the whole movie theater, from people of all ages. Their jokes are pretty simple, but still solid fun. The interaction between Gru and the little girls, is already solidified and brings such a different air from the first movie (even though, it follows kind of the same blueprint, meaning: an evil villain and a grandiose fight scene at the end). The addition of Jillian (Nasim Pedrad) to the gang was great and never felt out of place. I hope they do not get to make a Despicable Me 3 (although they probably will), because this was an excellent way to end this great series, otherwise they might end up like the Shrek franchise.Score (7)",5,0,1,5 July 2013
Howl's Moving Castle," It's the life in your year what counts!
","Again, another great movie of Miyazaki, full of characters from a fantasy world. I know it is based on a Diana Wynne Jones book, and it is not an original story by Miyazaki, but in my opinion is a great adaptation.I do like the parallel they draw between your physical appearance and how old are you feeling at heart.....the sudden changes in Sophie's appearance was a great example of that. Another interesting thing, is the fact that the war is never explained, probably trying to say, that sometimes wars drag that long that the reason behind it, is barely remembered.Beautiful drawings, and the characters were just hilarious (i.e. Calcifer)Score (8)",8,0,1,15 April 2013
Alien 3," Good ending for the series, but could have been much better
","Even though is not the best one of the trilogy (I don't want to count the fourth), I believe it was a good way to end the series. If things were not bad enough for Ripley in the previous one, now she founds herself stranded in a space prison, with no technology, infected and surrounded by a bunch a bold creepy prisoners.Ripley and the alien stories have been so intertwined throughout the series that is almost impossible for one to exist without the other, and I think this movie portrays this feeling perfectly, leading to the final sacrifice at the end.A lot of the complaints about the movie arouse from the fact that Newt and Hicks are out at the beginning of the movie (during the credits), and I was disappointed too! However, i think it was necessary to portray how much the creature has affected Ripley's life (although I feel the autopsy scene was unnecessary). I also do not think Hicks and Newt would have fit in the prison story.What I liked: The chase scenes from the alien point of view.The yellow color used throughout the movie, portrays the prison prison as a sad and depressing environment.What I didn't like: As everybody says, the way the alien was animated (specially on the running scenes) is probably the weakest of all the series (they should have gone to previous techniques).You can feel they were working without a script (it affected the director and the franchise). The story feels disconnected at times.Score (6)",6,0,0,2 May 2013
Source Code," Just don't try to rationalize the last 10 minutes, and you will enjoy it!
","After watching Moon by Duncan Jones, I was quite interested in watching his next work. After reading a brief summary of the movie, my first thought was, this will be way too similar to Deja Vu (2006, with Denzel Washington). I was wrong though, even though the movie is based on time travel as a vehicle to solve a crime, in this case the time traveler (Cpt. Stevens, cannot change what already occurred, and this travels are just merely to collect evidence).A big part of the movie happens in the same train compartment where Cpt. Stevens wakes up every time he 'travels' (it is more like access to somebody memories), however small changes occur every time, to avoid it become monotonous.The movie though, gets extended 10 minutes too long, otherwise it would have been a great ending. I do like when movies end in a happy note, but they should not sacrifice the whole story to make this possible. In this case they did it (in my opinion). I know science fiction does not have to make sense all the time. However there should be a balance where even though some things might not be able to be rationalized, you should not feel the argument proposed totally dumb (specially if the movie is trying to be a bit serious like this one).Score (7)",7,1,1,4 May 2013
Akira," Not my cup of tea, but the animation is great
","(Dubbed version). I was really interested in watching 'Akira', since everybody still mentions it as a cornerstone of Japanese animation, 25 years after its release (1988).You van definitely tell that the animation still looks pretty good, 25 years after. A lot of details in the backgrounds, and the way the main characters were draw. It is important to also mention, that the scenes of violence and topics covered (anarchy, experimentation in human subjects) were not common in animation by 1988 (at least in western animation, which is the one I am familiar with), which is probably also one of things that makes it a hallmark in animation.However, after watching the movie, I was never too engaged with the plot. In my opinion, there were too many things going at the same time (the fight of Kei's revolutionary group, what was the whole point of the ester's, the concept of the internal energy in every human) that did not allow me to focus in any of them, so I felt the narrative and the story a bit chopped.I know it might be because they tried to condensate a whole manga into a movie, but these should be 2 independent pieces of art, the movie should not rely on you reading the book to understand it, otherwise what is the point.Overall, I was not fully satisfied by the movie, making it an experience that I did not hate neither enjoy. (I learned also that I am not the biggest fan of Cyberpunk, as Akira belongs to this SciFi genre) Score (5)",4,4,7,19 May 2013
My Neighbor Totoro," Totoro + Catbus = Happiness
","I find really interesting that Totoro and Grave of the Fireflies were released in a double bill. More than the economical reasons behind it, I find interesting how both movies are focused on personal interactions (brother-sister, and sister-sister in Totoro), and how this can be drastically affected by the conditions. You might think that the siblings from Grave of the Fireflies could have had a similar life to the siblings in Totoro, if not for the circumstances.What I loved about the movie: - They way they portrayed rural life in the 50s was really amazing. It reminded me of the lifestyle my dad told me he experienced when growing up. If you ever had the chance of visiting a small rural town, where technology had not made an impact yet, you could notice the type of lifestyle they portray in Totoro.<ul><li>The plot is simple, and even though there are fantasy elements (Totoros and the catbus), they balance them with real life events (without making a lot of drama about it), such as the mom being sick, and the reaction of both kids to it.</li></ul>The balance between fantasy and reality is achieved beautifully in Ghibli movies, and this one is among the best ones at achieving that balance. No wonder this movie is an animation classic Score (9)",10,0,2,23 May 2013
Alien," They should have listened to Ripley!
","Having just watched Alien recently (for the 5th time at least), I find impressive how timeless is this sci-fi/horror classic. Even if it was released more than 30 years ago.I would have loved to watch this movie in the big screen, without knowing anything about Alien, because by the time I was old enough to watch Alien, in some way or another I had been exposed to the 'chest bursting scene' and other hallmarks of the Alien franchise.What I like the most about this movie are: - The whole scenery (the Nostromo is a space haunted house, and I love the way that the camera moves at a slow pace through the corridors at the beginning)is how it breaks a lot stereotypes of the genre by that time.<ul><li>Characters make silly decisions that lead to their death (like Brett), but in no way it looks cheap or dumb like in other horror movies. They just happen to be fulfilling a task for the crew, that led them to be isolated.</li></ul><ul><li>Having a female as leading character, surviving (I think that was kind of new for the genre, it was 1979!). The way they set the plot, you would imagine that Dallas might be the only survivor at the end, because Ripley doesn't take a lot of relevance until half the movie is done.</li></ul><ul><li>The crew feel real, a bunch of blue collar workers that just wanna collect their money and get home ASAP.</li></ul>A great movie, that made a great impact in both genres: Horror and Sci-fi Score (10)",10,1,3,22 April 2013
Aliens," A great space action adventure!
","Review of the Director's cut:Aliens it was the perfect follow up to Alien (1979), because it used the same elements of the previous story (the xenomorphs, Ripley, the dark corridors) without looking like the previous one at all. The introduction of the colonial space marines contribute to make this movie, a great space action film. Fortunately the way they are portrayed does not make them look silly (differently from Starship Troopers for example), and you get the feeling you get to know the few members of Sulaco's crew.The director's cut version adds a lot to the movies: - It shows you the life in LV-426 before all of them got infected, and therefore when they show the colony completely abandoned after the arrival of the marines, the impact is even bigger. - It shows you the moment when they tell Ripley that her daughter just passed away because she has been in stasis for 57 years!Unfortunately in my opinion the last 30 minutes of the movie were just not interesting enough (it kind of dragged a bit). Starting by the moment when Ripley decided to go to the basement to kill the queen. I understand that they had to show the queen, they could have fit her in some other moment of the movie. The last half hour is just a bunch of explosions and cliché phrases.I still love Aliens though. Probably not as much as the 1st one.Score (8)",8,0,1,28 April 2013
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Ape-ocalypse at the bridge!
","A really interesting movie to set up the events leading to the classic 'Planet of the Apes' (not the 2001 version!). I was highly satisfied movie with this prequel, because of several factors: - Andy Serkis performance as Caesar was just great. I am not really familiar with how motion-capture works, but however it works, Serkis's work was pretty. The way Caesar's facial expression changes after being exposed to real life was great.<ul><li>Motion-capture technology looked really nice.</li></ul><ul><li>Nice references to the original trilogy (The mention of an space mission bound to Mars in the newspapers, when the outbreak is starting was great).</li></ul>There were weak points too: - Steven Jacob's (Oyelowo's character). So he was against the vaccine all the way and suddenly he wants to go all in with any major proof? - Frieda Pinto is highly underused. They just use as a companion for Franco's character, when based on her knowledge of primates (the character) she could have been used in a better way.Overall, it is an entertaining movie for fans of the franchise. Pretty excited about the sequel! Score (7)",7,2,4,19 May 2013
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," Innovative movie and concepts for 1984
","(English dubbed version, DVD) What I liked:By watching this movie in 2013, you might think the animation is not top-notch. However you have to put things in context, I believe that for 1984 it was pretty innovative and detailed (such as details on the insects, or on the Valley of the Wind).The plot, is quite entertaining, a post-apocalyptic Earth, were humans survival does not depend on them, it actually depends on the nature (wind) they have poisoned. The environmentalist theme might seem a bit heavy handed for some people, but I think is developed nicely, basically stating that we need to find an equilibrium (I liked better though, the environmentalist theme in Mononoke).Nausicaa's character development and skills. The glider idea was really cool. Wondered why nobody else used them!I didn't like the part of the score that soundedd a bit 80s, I felt like I was playing 'Top Gear' and distracted me from the movie. However the instrumental part of the score, composed by Hisaishi was spectacular!They do not explain properly the origin of giant warriors, and the legend, which is fulfilled at the end.

Grave of the Fireflies," It is sad, but that can be a beautiful feeling too!
","Yes, it is a sad and emotional movie, but at the same time a beautiful one.Lately, I have been trying to watch all the Studio Ghibli movies, and this one was the next on the list. It definitely looks and feel different from the other movies of the Studio (it does not have all those fantasy characters and worlds, it tries to portray reality), this is probably because this movie is directed by Isao Takahata and not Miyazaki.I believe every person might take this movie in a different way, based on personal experiences. I took it as an example of the sacrifices you can make for somebody you love (in this case Seita's fraternal love for Setsuko), and how this love sometimes can lead you to make mistakes, such as was the case of Sentai, where he tried to do what his sister wanted and not what she needed.I do think it has an anti-war message (although I think it is not the principal theme of the plot), it end up being the background of these 2 kids journey. The animation is not as good as other Ghibli films (it is from 1988!), but still manages to portray properly the attitude of a stubborn teenager and the way of acting and innocence of a 4 year old.To sum it up. It is melodramatic, yes, but that is just a tool to deliver it's message. It personally reminded me of the way me and my sister interacted when we were kids, always looking after each other, and how that type of love and interaction with your family should never change, because our life is pretty short (as the fireflies).Score (8)",8,0,1,16 April 2013
Zero Dark Thirty," Mildly enjoyable!
","I was quite curios about 'Zero Dark Thirty' , since it was amongst the nominated for best film for the 2013 Academy Awards.I was a little bit disappointed at the end. Basically, because as everybody else mentioned before you never get too involved with the characters. Probably this was on purpose, in order to not distract the audience from the central plot, which was how they got to track Bin Laden.Leaving any political view aside (since we all know how massive were the result of this successful operation, in the counter-terrorism efforts), I feel the plot gets a bit boring at the beginning, the pace was quite slow, and since they do not get you involved with any of the characters, you have nothing to keep your attention 100 % (and I was not expecting, an action packed movie by the way).What I liked: - That last scene was beautifully filmed, and probably very realistic in my opinion. Not a lot of shooting, mainly a very professional and carefully planed.What I did not like: - Maya's character (Jessica Chastain). She was just insufferable. It was probably on purpose, but she was just annoying.Score (5)",5,1,4,9 May 2013
Prometheus," It's a space cobra!
","The movie landscapes and scenery in this movie look beautiful. However is really difficult to judge this movies without relating it at all with the Alien franchise. I know Ridley Scott has said several times that this is not a prequel to Alien (1979), there are a lot of similarities that leads me to compare Prometheus with other movies of the franchise.I did like the whole, theological discussion, and the whole deal about choosing what to believe. It was very interesting the way they try to draw a parallel between David and his relationship with humans, and humans and their interaction with their engineers. They both are looking for answers. There is a moment where David asks Holloway: 'Why did you make us?' and he answers 'because we can'. It seems is the same way with engineers and humans.The big problem arrives towards the final act of the movie. There is too much stuff going on, and they left way too many questions unanswered. I do like when movies do not give you all the answers (like Alien) but at the same time, they are trying to tell a story, and if they left too many gaps in the plot, the story feels incomplete, making it disappointing.Two thing that could have easily been fixed:<ul><li>The way Millburn and Fifield get infected is just dumb. They just look utterly stupid. If you compare it to a very similar scene, such as the one where Kane gets infected in Alien, the impression it gives me is that in Alien (1979) the driving factor was human curiosity, in Prometheus Millburn just look stupid.</li></ul><ul><li>Vickers did not need to runaway in a straight line. The scene could have looked more clever.</li></ul>However at the end of the day, the movie was entertaining enough, and brought some interesting details about the Alien franchise.Score (7)",6,0,3,22 April 2013
The Iron Giant," Souls don't die
","The Iron Giant is another great movie by Brad Bird. I decided to watch this based on the good comments in 'The Animation Addicts Podcast', and I was not disappointed.The animation is pretty good, classic 2D, with some CGI here and there (I read the giant is actually made on CGI). The way they animated the robot is pretty good, the movements (sometimes being clumsy, like not being really sure how to fit in the surroundings), the voice, the fact that it barely talks, and just open his mouth to say something relevant.Overall, I think this one is a pretty good family movie, that I think adults can also enjoy (I am on my 30s), because besides of being fun and funny, touches some topics such as how we are scared of what we don't know and tend to judge before even giving us the chance to get to know something or someone. The good thing of the movie, is that it does that without being too preachy.Score (8)",8,0,1,19 April 2013
