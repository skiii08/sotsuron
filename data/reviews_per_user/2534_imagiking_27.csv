Black Swan," Black Swan: Interesting and Intelligent
","Hailed by many as a modern art masterpiece, nominated for awards aplenty, and benefiting from a series of rather beautiful posters, Black Swan was the first of the current Oscar bait pieces I was reeled in by.An aspiring ballet dancer since her childhood, Nina Sayers is eager to be chosen for the lead role in her company's presentation of Swan Lake. The demanding role requires her to perform as both the white and black swans, the latter of which she is less well equipped to do. The competition from fellow dancer Lily, the restrictions of her overprotective mother, and strange marks on her back are just some of the oddities that begin to plague Nina as she trains.The film begins, as it quite appropriately ought to, with a ballet sequence, the first of many. Perhaps ignorantly, I was slightly fearful of being overrun by an excess of such scenes, my general cynicism toward dance and the like making itself known in the back of my head. Such fears were, and are, entirely unwarranted. In its opening scene, Black Swan demonstrates beautifully the complex combination of cinematography, choreography, and performance which combine so well to create scenes of near dazzling effulgence even to the most hardened of sceptics. The first of these is also the most appealing, its grandeur revealed quickly to be a dream of our protagonist. Nina is portrayed wonderfully by Portman, the quiet fragility she brings to the character eliciting sympathy every step of the way, her apologetic passivity difficult not to sympathise with. Cassel too gives a fine performance, his sexually suspect instructor suitably imposing and creepy. Despite their mutual proficiency, these performances are both towered over by Hershey in her maternal role, one of the film's very strongest facets. Strong too is Aronofsky's use of mise-en-scène, the placement of mirrors throughout the film and the stark contrast between black and white which pervades its every scene working well with the general idea of duality which the film examines. This is, however, a little overstated by the end, the constancy of the monochrome and mirror effect becoming eventually an irritant through overuse. Subtlety seems an alien concept to the film, tarnishing slightly its otherwise wonderful art direction. Nevertheless, the film tackles its primary theme well, utilising the aforementioned visual cues to reinforce the narrative itself. Of the narrative, a quick complaint must be made. After an approximate eighty minutes of slow, contemplative, atmospheric building of tension and suspense, Aronofsky turns it all up to eleven and throws everything at us. Though it does little to detract from the overall effect of the film, it feels very sudden and tonally different from what came before, quite probably deliberately but unfortunately rather amusingly—not a feeling it should evoke.Though its interesting and intelligent art direction is somewhat marred by its blatancy, Black Swan is a visually interesting piece, communicating certain ideas via its lighting and mise-en-scène ever before doing so via its narrative. Not as strong as it potentially could have been, and delving less deep into its central theme than perhaps it should, one wonders to what extra-narrative end, if any, the film has been envisioned. Though far too accelerated in its finale's insanity, the film is an entertaining work, visually appealing, and populated with interesting, well-articulated characters.",7,1,3,26 January 2011
Changeling," Changeling: A Solid Offering
","Clint Eastwood, in recent times, has returned again and again to my mind as a director of considerable prowess, the (modern, at least) films of whom offer consistently powerful stories with a deeply dark tone resonating throughout. The recent Warner Brothers release of 35 Eastwood films prompted me to begin a further exploration of his catalogue, a task I began with Changeling, itself—a Universal release—not included in the aforementioned collection.Apparently taken from real events, Changeling presents the story of Christine Collins, a single mother newly promoted to supervisor in a telecommunications firm. Forced to leave her son alone for a few hours when she is called upon to cover a shift, Collins returns to find him gone. The eventual discovery of a child she is resolutely convinced is not her own leads her to conflicts with the obdurate police force as they refuse to resume the search for the boy they insist is now returned.Following on from the intriguing companion piece projects that were Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima, and released less than two months before Gran Torino, Changeling is a work from a man churning out films of a high quality at an extraordinary pace. From the beginning Eastwood's fondness for shadows is seen, the director's thematically synonymous usage of lighting among his most recognisable trademarks. Also apparent from the onset is a surprising modesty in Jolie's performance. Truth be told, I daresay I'd not have noticed who was on the screen had I not already known the cast. She blends perfectly into the well created period setting, her performance subtle in the film's beginnings. A minor hiccup encountered at an early stage is the film's pacing; the child has been lost and returned within approximately thirty minutes. Whilst the story that follows is of course the film's centrepiece, the rapidity of the earlier scenes is somewhat diminutive in communicating Collins' emotional response. The film—and we along with it—are given insufficient time to appreciate the loss, the lack of a decent plaintive scene portraying a mother's loss the evident problem. Once the primary narrative arrives, however, the film picks itself up and delivers a series of political messages alongside a succession of emotional scenes. Jolie begins to shine as the woman determined not to be silenced, Malkovich's supporting role adding a fiery criticism which works well to reinforce the damnation of public office corruption. What seems a side-plot integrates itself proficiently into the main narrative with a number of eerily fascinating scenes and a trio of fine supporting performances. The nature of this is perhaps a tad familiar in manner, not quite as original as we might have hoped for, but a fair excuse for Eastwood to indulge himself with replete darkness as he does so well. The film's finale is suitable, working quite well to replicate and maintain the overall tone of the piece.An atavistic portrait, Changeling is not without its flaws. Jolie's performance, though more impressive than ever I'd expected of her, falls short of brilliance through its stoicism, a little too neat emotionally. The character's strength is not—in this case—the film's. Aside from this, it is effective in what it attempts to do, delivering an enthralling story with a world-weary realism conveyed as much—if indeed not more—through its lighting as through its narrative. Though not quite as strong as many of its neighbours in the Eastwood library, Changeling is a solid offering from a man who is doubtlessly one of American cinema's finest working directors.",7,1,6,7 January 2011
Lords of Dogtown," Lords of Dogtown: Sufficient
","The kind of person not even remotely enticed by the idea of a film about skateboarding, Lords of Dogtown was something I lazily opted to watch on television because of a name: Emile Hirsch in this case.Exploring the shift in early-70s California from surfboards to skateboards, Lords of Dogtown follows primarily three young characters associated with the sport's beginnings. Recruited by local surf/skate shop owner Skip to his new team, the trio—along with others—begin to ascend the ranks and eventually find themselves besieged by offers from other, more financially appealing teams.The opening credit sequence of Lords of Dogtown bears that most unfortunate of addendums: based on a true story. Such real life ensemble dramas are as rocky a territory as one can encounter in script terms, often only worthy of attention by those already interested in the subject matter. Such was my feeling as I began to watch this, the film focused, as you may well argue it should be, upon the skateboarding itself. Flittering glimpses of human drama are seen at various points: the splitting up of Jay's mother and her boyfriend; the relationship between Stacy and his girlfriend. These are mostly superfluous and perfunctory; surface skimming of something from which you feel the film could, and should, make more. This aside, the humour is plentiful, laughter making its presence felt regularly and appropriately. Be it the casual dismissiveness of Skip to his inner-ear-problem-besotted volunteer employee Sid, the scenes of manic teenage activity, or the athletic alacrity with which the characters throw themselves around the screen, the entertainment value is consistent for all. Problematic are the less friendly aspects of the team's wildness, such insignificant instances as their theft of an old man's hat and shouting vulgarities at nearby septuagenarians a deterrent factor in getting to like the characters. Nevertheless, they are at least partially endearing, their ascension an enjoyable spectacle. The film bears nothing of technical noteworthiness, save for some interesting shots from between the skateboard wheels as its respective riders take it for a test drive. An interesting concept, and one which perhaps might have benefited from some additional exploration. Hirsch's performance, it being my reason for sitting before the film, is amiable and solid, though undeniably outweighed by that of Ledger. An odd character is created between Ledger's drunken rants, meddlesome mischief, and disorganised handling of something which explodes beyond what he ever thought it might. Oddly handled to say the least, the performance elevates a background character to the foreground, bringing us to wonder what ever did become of Skip when the ending gives us—in rather frustrating text-over-still-image format we've seen so oft before—the future of these characters.Despite portraying a subject in which I couldn't be less interested, Lords of Dogtown manages to keep things entertaining for most of its running time. Though it touches lightly upon a number of subjects without ever exploring any of them particularly deeply, the central and simple friendship story at its heart is sufficient to warrant its watching, being as it is more the kind of thing you watch when it happens to come on than one you actively seek out.",6,1,2,19 January 2011
Oldboy," Oldeuboi: Entirely Exquisite
","The second of Chan-wook Park's 'Vengeance Trilogy', Oldeuboi appears to be the most revered and respected of the thematic triplets. Having absolutely loved the first, Boksuneun naui Geot, I was highly sceptical that this could possibly do any better.Having been imprisoned inexplicably for fifteen years, Dae-su Oh finds himself released just as suddenly and mysteriously. Knowing nothing about where or why he was kept, he sets out on a quest for revenge, meeting along the way a sushi chef with whom he begins to fall in love.One of the opening scenes, in which Dae-su stumbles drunkenly about a police station, provides us with nice humour: partly a way to lull us into a false sense of security; partly a way to make the darkness which follows tolerable. Like its predecessor, Oldeuboi is incredibly dark and gritty, both its themes and imagery constantly exploring the very depths of depravity and despair. The scenes of imprisonment are strange: while Dae-su's cage is neither bare nor uncomfortable, he himself becomes increasingly so, the scenes of graduating delusion and hallucinating building to an inevitable crescendo of tragedy. It is difficult to watch him spiral downwards, not least of all when he learns that he has been framed for the murder of his wife. Min-sik Choi's performance incorporates a flurry of perfectly timed and pitched emotions, cementing an incredibly real character within our minds and allowing him to evolve whilst all the while remembering his thirst for vengeance and the effect of his incarceration. Hye-jeong Kang grounds the film with a meek humility, her unassuming sushi chef the only element of sanity in Dae-su's insane world. The narrative effectively keeps us guessing, the final turns in plot unforeseen and quite striking, adding to the facets a consistently excellent story, and one which invites thought in a genuine manner. Worth noting is the corridor sequence relatively early in the film, a superb technical achievement and one of the film's crowning glories. A true spectacle which presents action in a unique way, bringing a brilliance to what might have been a mundane scene.An entirely exquisite follow-up to the first of the trilogy, Oldeuboi succeeds under the magnificence of Park's direction. Ensuring the further remarkableness of this astounding offering, it leaves all demanding to see part three. For me, it falls just short of the level of excellence achieved by its forebear. An amazing film in any case, it is yet another example of the prowess of South Korean cinema.",8,1,3,27 July 2010
127 Hours," 127 Hours: Inconsequential, Inconclusive, and Disappointing
","It's difficult, around this time of year, to maintain one's cynicism toward awards ceremonies. So many major winners of the last decade have, to me, seemed so horridly overrated that it is difficult to lend any credence to an Oscar nomination anymore. Nonetheless, I was drawn into the premise of 127 Hours: the prospect of a single setting, and the ever likable James Franco.A true-life story of climber/canyoneer Aron Ralston, 127 Hours follows the character as he sets out for the weekend to Blue John canyon. Having told nobody where he is going, Ralston intends to fully enjoy the escapism the wilderness brings. This self-imposed isolation becomes a burden, however, when he finds himself trapped, a fallen boulder crushing his arm against a crevasse wall.The praise heaped upon writer/director Danny Boyle following his previous effort Slumdog Millionaire is indelibly related to the cynicism mentioned above. Slumdog, for me, was a perfectly fine film, but in no way deserving of such championing. Boyle's position as director was something of a bad omen as such, leaving me slightly worried about what might happen with the film. These worries appear justified almost immediately, Boyle splitting the screen to a triptych (though technically not) showing large crowds of people. This carries on for almost ten minutes, the broken screen fine for a credit sequence but rapidly tired-out and overused almost immediately after. Thankfully it subsides eventually, allowing us to take in the wonderful setting of the film. The vast canyon expanse is quite, quite beautiful, given appropriate treatment with wide angle lenses. It is fewer than twenty minutes before Ralston becomes trapped, the trailer-featured scenes with two female fellow adventurers apparently consisting of the entirety of their presence in the film. Not that I'm complaining, mind; sitting in a canyon with James Franco was what I paid to do. And Franco is wonderful, his performance carrying the film exactly as it needs to. One moment in particular, immediately after Ralston's hallucinatory imagining of a talk show, demonstrates perfectly Franco's humanity in this role. Unfortunately, Boyle seems to have insufficient confidence in entrusting the entirety of the film to the strength of Franco's performance, and consequentially we are left with regular flashbacks, imagined party scenes, bizarre appearances of Scooby Doo, and agonisingly infuriating gimmicky camera-work. It seems as though the film is trying to add a layer of quirky geekiness to its effects, and these prove little more than distracting and deprecating, leaving us with fewer moments of pure performance. An additional qualm comes in the form of Ralston's character as expressed in the film. I found his story inescapably comparable to that of Christopher McCandless, the inspiration behind Sean Penn's infinitely superior Into the Wild. Unlike Into the Wild, 127 Hours does not manage to build itself a protagonist with sufficient depth of characterisation to craft a meaningful message, resigning itself instead to the status of mere story. We emerge from 127 Hours with little on our minds to consider, save the reuse of that damned triptych effect.Though its star delivers a very fine performance—when the director has faith enough to allow him to perform, that is—127 Hours just seems inconsequential, inconclusive, and disappointing. This is the sort of film from which one should take home a message of sorts, but the thinly-sketched and unconflicted character at its heart prevents any such meaningfulness. Oddly enough, it's this film's potential which drags it down.",6,3,7,4 February 2011
Insomnia," Insomnia: Flawed But Acceptable Remake
","As mentioned in my review of this film's 1997 Norwegian parent, of late I am deeply interested in the similarities and differences between foreign language films and their American remakes. With a fondness for both Scandinavian cinema and Al Pacino, the Insomnias were an obvious case to investigate.Remaining faithful to its forebear in terms of the main plot, Insomnia gives us Detective Will Dormer, assigned to the investigation of a 17 year old girl's murder. Amidst difficulty adjusting to the midnight sun of Alaska, an unfortunate accident forces him to lie about his actions. He becomes haunted by both his guilt and the threatening musings of the girl's murderer, who knows the truth.An interesting opening credits sequence combines images of a bloodstained fabric with the beautiful Alaskan setting this remake calls home. A fair answer to the original's setting, the remote wilderness offers incredible scenery, its iciness as entrancingly mysterious as the unexplained sanguine fibres. The first and most noticeable difference to set this apart from its Norwegian counterpart is the female detective, played here by Hilary Swank. Despite Swank's entirely likable performance, one cannot help but lament this change of direction. The original character's austerity was her strength; the alternative's naivety her weakness. The mentor-student dynamic which forms between Pacino and she is, while unique and understandable, far less effective than the tension of the original relationship. Due to a combination of the newly introduced IA subplot, the dropping of the retirement age and concomitant hearing problems of the main detective's partner, and the lack of an American gun ban, Dormer's 'accident' and whether it is indeed that becomes more the focus of attention than the guilt of Engström's. Additionally, the original's heavy usage of insomnia in a metaphorical sense is largely replaced here by its physical effects. More realistic? Probably. More effective? Absolutely not. It only really comes into play in the finale, an action filled Hollywood shootout that drags a flawed but acceptable remake down in its last act. Pacino's latter-day madness is on full display here, much different to Skarsgård and, much as I love Al, a less compelling performance. Now Williams, however, takes his part and flies with it, bringing something new and creative to his adaptation: one of disappointingly few improvements upon the original film. An intoxicatingly interesting point to be made is that the dead dog into which Dormer shoots his decoy bullet replaces a live one shot by Engström: a fascinating difference which speaks volumes, both about the difference in characterisation and the allowances and tolerances of the respective film industries.As a remake, Insomnia is certainly poorer than its source, replacing some key plot points with less effective ones and adding an ending which is as trashy as the one it replaces is superb. Standing alone as its own work, it mostly manages to present its ideas decently and entertainingly, crafting a film better than much of the other schlock that gets churned out. If only we lived in a better world, the budget of this could have gone to distributing the original. C'est la vie, alas...",5,2,4,26 July 2010
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," A Genuine Achievement
","Boldly announcing himself upon the stage of international cinema with 2009's Let the Right One In, the significant critical and commercial acclaim accorded director Thomas Alfredson clearly proved him a filmmaker capable of pulling off high quality adaptations of complex and dark literary sources.Called back into service to uncover the identity of a Soviet mole at the height of the Cold War, retired British intelligence operative George Smiley is tasked with unwinding a vastly convoluted web of conspiracy, codenames, double agents, and deceit.The movement from relatively low-budget foreign language filmmaking to helming star casts in comparably costly productions is one that, historically, holds significant risk for directorial careers. Add to the mix the danger of bringing a much-loved novel to life on screen, and Alfredson is certainly faced with a substantial task. An espionage thriller, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy—based on John le Carré's book—throws an extremely layered narrative at its audience and insists they keep up, making little in the way of allowance for those accustomed to excess plot exposition. Concerning an approximate dozen key characters—most of whom go by at least two names—the film contains a considerable quantity of raw information to be processed, particularly considering its reserved pace; the camera scrolls slowly across the screen in step with the story's measured progression, constantly moving along yet never losing the integral tension of its hastelessness. Alfredson and screenwriters Bridget O' Connor and Peter Straughan demonstrate a keenness for the more tensely-oriented end of the genre, delving into an atmosphere of unease rather than one of brisk spy action. There is almost an air of claustrophobia to much of the film, the caliginous cinematography and mysterious score combining to evoke an aura of noir paranoia. Much like Let the Right One In, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy boasts a thrilling visual panache; indeed, Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is oftentimes so remarkably involving that entire scenes may pass by without any absorption of the dialogical details disclosed therein—the brain is simply too overcome by the aesthetic bombardment of visual pleasure to decipher the explicit aural signals. One particular shot—an extreme close-up of Smiley's wearied face draped in shadow— affords the audience the time to study the furrowed ridges of his forehead and the weighted bags of his eyelids, giving us an entitled sense of knowledge of, and familiarity with, this character. It seems almost redundant to offer praise to the film's extraordinary cast; a brief glance at the list of exemplary names will disclose the sheer calibre of talent on display: a veritable dream team of the finest names of modern British cinema. From Firth to Hurt, Hardy to Cumberbatch, Oldman to Dencik, the phenomenal cast plays beautifully together, each actor inhabiting their character with award-courting flair. Where Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy really shines is in its characterisation—an all-too often underutilised aspect in this genre—each of them distinctly human rather than simply mouths through which the plot developments are channelled. Their primary concern may be with their espionage, but ours is with them: exploring their motivations; their private lives; their loyalties; and just how a career like theirs affects an existence. A recurring Christmas party scene revisited a number of times throughout the film reminds us regularly that these intelligence agents are not solely extensions of the government's facilities, but rather human beings with emotions, afflicted by the agonies of their toils, burying themselves in vodka-laced punch to just get away from it all.Hitting all the right notes in its performances, script, and direction, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy triumphantly infuses a challengingly multifarious narrative with a deeper humanity, questioning by proxy the way in which devotion to duty affects all aspects of our lives. Shot with unforgettable effulgence—committing to memory eternal every last contour of Oldman's storied brow—it is a genuine achievement in cinematic storytelling.",8,193,278,17 September 2011
The Expendables," The Expendables: A Blustering Flurry of Disappointment
","Sylvester Stallone and I have long held a very rocky and uncertain relationship. His early material (the first two Rocky films, First Blood, even Paradise Alley and F.I.S.T.) exhibited a man with talent and cinematic know-how beyond his gruff and mumbling appearance. The mid 80s saw the beginning of a seemingly never-ending whirlwind of generic action hits (even managing to affect, and almost effect, the Rocky and Rambo franchises). A modern day revival (beginning perhaps with Cop Land and reaching a breathtaking zenith with Rocky Balboa) boasted to my surprise that Sly could still hold his own in the cinematic ring. As such, I had high expectations of The Expendables. Could this be Stallone's way of apologising for his previous indulgences with a proper action film?An elite group of professional mercenaries, The Expendables find themselves tasked with removing a tyrannical despot backed by a rogue CIA agent. Struggling with problems both within the team and without, leader Barney Ross is disinclined to accept the mission until the determination of a local young woman inspires him to help out those who truly need it.As I said in the overly long introductory paragraph above, Stallone has shown in recent times that he can not only still act, but can direct in a beautiful and effective manner and create enticing and rewarding stories. The Expendables is his first effort in applying this second wind of creativity to something entirely original; not based on a previously explored character. From the get-go, the stripped down and unglamourised violence which characterised 2008's Rambo is seen here, again used to steer the tired genre back to its early roots. The first scene exhibits some misplaced and ineffective humour, including some barely vagued digs at Stallone's age. Once we are introduced to the characters, we begin to be assailed by one-liners, genre cliché, and some woeful acting. Randy Couture displays the on screen charisma of a furniture shop, bizarrely being given the bulk of a scene (and a very poor one at that) to carry despite has lack of talent of any sort whatsoever. Twenty to thirty minutes in comes the long awaited scene for which the film garnered much of its publicity: Stallone, Schwarzenegger, and Willis sharing the screen at last. To call it a disappointment is an understatement, the barrage of pitiful dialogue and rapid-fire 'jokes' making the doors seem ever more appealing. Thereafter we launch into the main section of the movie, more of the same: relatively decent action; astoundingly awful dialogue; standard genre techniques. A blustering flurry of disappointment and despair, made even worse by the occasional line or glance which seem to showcase an actual film struggling to make itself known beneath the layers of well-trodden stereotypes. A scene featuring Mickey Rourke describing his reasoning behind retiring from the group is the paragon of these moments, Rourke's genuinely breathtaking performance by far the best thing to be seen here, albeit entirely wasted. One cannot help but think The Expendables may once have had some potential, a thought which engenders much lamentation given the eventual extent of its mediocrity. And, as if we needed further flaws, no main character is ever harmed at all, and we get a happy ending gearing us up for a sequel. Oh, bother.Although I desperately wanted to find a good film within this, and gave it every chance to present itself, The Expendables leaves a bitter taste of disappointment and a feeling of betrayal. Lacking any innovation or originality, wasting opportunities all around, and delivering dialogue to make ears swell up, it simply fails. Though I will commend its action sequences, better as they are than most modern films, it's just not enough.",3,11,24,27 August 2010
Shutter Island," Shutter Island: Riddled With Flaws
","Shutter Island, the new film from Martin Scorsese, has a hell of a lot to live up to. Personally, I had great faith in the film and was quite looking forward to it. The premise seemed quite interesting and possessing of wonderful potential.And that it was: Leonardo DiCaprio is US Marshall Teddy Daniels, sent to investigate the disappearance of a prisoner from the eponymous institution for the criminally insane. Working through the stress of a recent tragedy, he falls deeper and deeper into the mysterious case, where everyone seems to be hiding something.When I first saw Teddy's partner Chuck, and heard in my head the words he was about to say ('You okay boss?'), I knew things were not going to go as well as I hoped. Predictability reigned supreme. From that clichéd 50s detective line to the 'twist' ending, bearing all the subtlety and surprise of a loud and luminescent train, things were often painfully obvious. The beginning is annoyingly over-dramatic, the score astoundingly over the top. Plot-exposition-by-numbers soon follows, as well as the overstated oddness of this island. After a very flawed introduction, the film does turn in a better direction. The middle was far more enjoyable than what came before, winning me over somewhat with its developing strangeness. It's not long, however, before the clear signs are given and we see the ending about halfway into the film, making the rest rather a waste of time. We plummet dramatically into a worse third act than first. I was shocked at Marty's descent into intensive plot explanation, taking perhaps half an hour of drawn out dialogue followed by dramatisations of that very dialogue and making me feel as though he thought I was a child incapable of understanding what was happening. For goodness' sake, Ben Kingsley even unveils a drawn out explanation from beneath a velvet cover. Grow up Marty, and don't be so condescending. The movie also owes far more than it cares to admit to The Shining, desperately yearning to be the infinitely superior film for a good portion of its running time while adding the music of Cape Fear gone mad. My poor ears.Shutter Island is riddled with flaws. It is clunky, overly long, shamefully evident, unoriginal, inconsistent in quality and poorly derivative of a far more enjoyable film. There is enjoyment to be found, however, in the fun middle section and closing statement; one which did at least lend gravitas to its climax. A poor film it may be, but it is at least a fun one at that. Scorsese has underperformed here, though not entirely terribly.",5,14,30,13 March 2010
American Beauty," American Beauty: Cinematic Perfection
","I tracked down this film more to sample the further delights of Alan Ball than anything else, his incredible creation in Six Feet Under demanding I seek out all else by this genius. His debut as a screenwriter, as well as Mendes' as a director, American Beauty has become recognised as an enduring great.A search for meaning in a flawed world, American Beauty is the life of Lester Burnham. An advertising employee, Burnham is the epitome of the archetypical suburban man: trapped in a job he despises, a marriage which has long ago run out of steam, and a life which seems devoid of significance or happiness. Catalysed by the arrival of revolutionary thinker Ricky next door, Burnham begins to realise the extent of unhappiness he is prone to, and see his life for what it truly is.Kevin Spacey's voice-over narration introduces us immediately to his character and the world around him, as well as the eventual turn of the plot. This early revelation of the film's ending is interesting and tells us from the outset that American Beauty relies not on narrative to entice its viewers. What exactly it does rely on is impossible to say, the pure perfection of each of its constituent elements as apparently important as each other. Ball's script dominates, his impressive wit and broodingly dark intelligence reigning supreme over the film. Mendes' direction gives us shot after shot of crippling beauty, as per the title. The performances are perhaps the most attractive thing to be found, the casting almost certainly the best I have ever seen. These actors and actresses were born for these roles, with Spacey, Bening, Cooper and Bentley providing particularly deep immersion and poignancy. All combine to give a powerful film which incites thought, boasts an unrivalled aesthetic, questions the modern world, and entertains superbly.With the dark hilarity and ripe relevance characteristic of Ball, Mendes gives us a memorable, sublime and incredibly important piece of cinematic perfection. Career defining performances from all give us characters we recognise from our own lives, further dragging us into the film's spellbinding brilliance. Unique and ever essential, American Beauty is the kind of film which makes life worth living.",9,0,1,28 March 2010
The Exorcist," The Exorcist: It's Fine, But Far From Brilliant
","Regularly labelled as the scariest film of all time, and considered by many to be the best, the infamous stories surrounding the release of The Exorcist and the reactions of its audiences ensure an impressive reputation precedes the viewing of this classic.Concerning 12 year old Regan MacNeil, the film details her possession at the hands of the demon Pazuzu. After the subsequent psychiatric and medical treatments prove useless, her mother arranges an exorcism, hiring two priests to drive the demon from her daughter's body.With such a reputation, I was either going to be disappointed, or discover a film I would love. Sadly, the former was the case. Good performances compliment the film, an interesting concept and storyline give it a solid foundation, but it just turned out to be overrated. It features an interesting and compelling theme, and one I see most effectively in the character of Father Karras. His was the plot line I was most interested in, and one which I feel was particularly well developed, Jason Miller giving a wonderfully stoic depth of emotion to his character. In the end, I certainly enjoyed the film, but it was nothing to the reputation it enjoys. Certain scenes seemed rather unnecessarily violent and inappropriate and included simply for the shock value, detracting from the film's effect and making me question its true intentions. It may be the case that the film has not aged particularly well, and I do wish I had seen it on its initial release, but as I did see it, it did little for me beyond a standard quantity of entertainment.The Exorcist supports itself for its running time, its thematic shadow lingering throughout. Father Karras is the film's best facet, but he's not enough in himself, leaving the film somewhat unbalanced. In short, it's fine, but far from brilliant.",8,2,3,17 March 2010
The Lives of Others," Das Leben der Anderen: Subtle But Touching
","A movie I'd long been intending to watch, Das Leben der Anderen has many accolades to its name, not least of all its Oscar. Add to this the generally intarnishable excellence of modern German cinema, and you have a sure recipe for entertainment.An exploration of Cold War Germany, Das Leben der Anderen is the story of GDR espionage officer Gerd Wiesler in his duties spying upon playwright and actress couple Georg and Christa-Maria. Initially a faithful servant of the East, Wiesler is slowly romaniticised by the ideals subtly instilled within his subconscience by those he surveills.As one might expect from a film set during this era, Das Leben der Anderen is heavily political. We see this immediately expressed through several characters, primarily Wiesler. Cold, austere, and unemotional, he shows us the filmmakers' view of East Germany and its agents, conveying to us the sinister notoriety of this infamous entity. It takes perhaps half an hour of the film's running time before we observe a trace of humanity within the character: a veritable needle in a haystack of socialist stoicism. The gentle unravelling of his personal life is wonderful, giving us a detailed picture by showing a blank canvas. As Wiesler's vacuous life of monotony and iciness rolls on, the shared life of his assigned targets seems ever more appealing, the romance between them something entirely foreign and unknown to him. This juxtaposition, purveyed through colour schemes of respective apartments as well as the actors themselves, is for me more appealing than the film's significant political commentary. The extent of the effect of Georg upon Wiesler, despite the fact that they never actually meet, is fantastically enthralling, slowly coming to show us the human side of the previously authoritarian figure. Undoubtedly, the praise for this belongs to Mühe, his performance calm, collected, and capturing. As well as the gripping characterisation, the film's plot is involving; a well paced drama that effectively shows us life behind the wall. The film is rife with subtle but touching moments, beautiful in their simplicity and impact. Not least of these is the closing line, its delivery absolutely perfect and hard-hitting. Tonally, the film is consistent and insistent, evidencing the eagerness of von Donnersmarck to tell this important story.Accurately portraying the concomitant fear, uncertainty, and disillusion of the GDR's command, Das Leben der Anderen propels us effortlessly into the world of its characters. Slowly and comprehensively crafting a complete picture of its main character, one which gradually affixes itself forever to our affections, this is a very fine film indeed.",7,1,2,5 July 2010
Ghostbusters," Ghostbusters: Less Good Than it Should Be
","Hardly needing any sort of introduction, Ghostbusters is a classic film which is celebrated as one of the best known and most loved comedies in film history.For those exceptional few of you who aren't aware, it's about a team of three college psychology professors who, when they're thrown out of their jobs, establish a business hunting down and capturing ghosts together. A strange ancient legend comes to bear and the laughs roll off amidst the action.It's not hard to see the lasting appeal of this film, the many quirky lines coming primarily from the ever wonderful Bill Murray. There's plenty of jostling and joking between the Ghostbusters, the Murray/Aykroyd dynamic being particularly effective. Although the jokes are effective, and the laughs are certainly many, there's something lacking in the film and I found myself somewhat disappointed in the face of this imposing legacy. It's not that it's a bad film, certainly not, there aren't even a huge number of flaws. The humour works well, and there are little to no jokes which fail entirely. That said, it feels less good than it should be. Perhaps, my time rather after Ghostbusters', it's just that bit too dated to be particular appealing to my comedy tastes. The problem lies primarily in the nature of the laughs; none entirely memorable or strong. Not once was I struggling for breath, more chuckling lightly at the funny but never hilarious dialogue. Additionally, Murray's upfront affection always seemed very strange to me, though this impacts little on the film.Though graced with clever writing, rapid-fire dialogue, and fine acting, Ghostbusters simply seems lacking, and the majority of the jokes are more smileworthy than laughworthy. Perfectly good for a chuckle though.",7,1,2,2 March 2010
Million Dollar Baby," Million Dollar Baby: Stunningly Brilliant
","If I'm not wrong, Million Dollar Baby was the first Clint Eastwood directed film I ever saw. A good number of years having passed since then, I recently decided to sit down and watch this again, to see if the original impression still stuck.Having waitressed since her early teenage years, Maggie Fitzgerald has yearned for years to make it as a professional boxer. Introducing herself to aging trainer Frankie Dunn, she latches onto the crotchety sceptic, insisting he take her under his wing and refusing to take no for an answer.As with all of his films, Eastwood's direction becomes instantly evident as a facet within the very first moments of Million Dollar Baby. The literal gritty darkness of his scenes form the basis of his work's appeal for me, the corresponding themes in no small part furthering this. Our early introduction to Dunn shows him as a classic Eastwood character of the latter day era: curmudgeonly; emotionless; granite- faced. His blank refusal to acquiesce to Maggie's unending requests comes as no surprise. The eager friendliness of Duff is a delight, her continual hope in spite of Eastwood's gruffness a bright and warm antithesis to his cold darkness. The inevitable change in this dynamic is well constructed, neatly avoiding the potential pitfall of seeming contrived and uncharacteristic. Fleeting moments of kindness punctuate Dunn's continuing harshness, gently developing him over the whole span of the film. Worth noting, most certainly, is Freeman. An exquisite supporting character, his Scrap is the sagacious guiding light of Dunn's conscience and morality, forging a formidable double act offering solid laughs as well as essential and unmissable dramatic scenes. The progress of Maggie's career is perhaps a little too cinematic, though never much the focus of the film. It relies constantly on the strength of the relationships of its characters, and on the fact that these are expressed almost wordlessly. Maggie's family, when we are unfortunate enough to encounter them, are sickeningly horrible people, telling us a great deal about her character in a most wonderful way. The film's final act is what sets it above most others: a beautiful, compelling, touching, unexpected, and masterful finale to a captivating character drama. Harder hitting than anyone in the film, it remains one of the most stunningly brilliant segues in cinematic history.Bearing the hallmarks of Eastwood's ever exceptional direction, Million Dollar Baby combines a darkness in both lighting and subject matter with universally inimitable performances. Getting the very best from his actors as only he can, Eastwood takes us on an intoxicatingly enticing journey, dragging us through a minefield of emotion and giving us a truly unique experience, one of the best American cinema can offer.",8,0,0,5 July 2010
Into the Wild," Into the Wild: Uncompromisingly Brilliant
","Into the Wild is Sean Penn's adaptation of the same-titled novel by John Krakaeur. Filmed, among other places, in the wilds of Alaska where a good deal of the real story it tells occurred, it is a faithful presentation of an interesting tale.The film is the story of Christopher McCandless, a college graduate who becomes disillusioned with the world of upper class life, and goes off into the wild to find something more meaningful in his existence. Meeting many interesting characters along the way and affecting their own views on life, McCandless aims forever toward Alaska, the final point of his lengthy journey.I found myself instantly drawn into this film. The primary element in this effect is the soundtrack. Eddie Vedder creates a beautiful score which chronicles this adventure and compliments the sprawling beauty of the unoccupied landscapes. The visuals of the film are incredible, the natural shots of this better, effulgent world spellbinding. Penn beautifully directs some of the most stunning images that can be captured. Undoubtedly, the film owes all to the main performance. Emile Hirsch creates a character so real, emotional and three dimensional that we cannot help but be pulled into his vision of the world. The voiceovers from Chris and his sister give us a deeper insight into his motivations as the film flickers between our hero in his perfect world, travelling to get there, and experiencing his personal hell at home. All comes together to create a stunning experience which left me breathless and amazed at its power. The strength of the film is impressive, staggeringly poignant and uncompromisingly brilliant. Especially touching, for me at least, was the performance of Hal Holbrook, a genuinely upsetting and tear-jerking addition.With some of the best acting one can ever hope to experience in film, the natural beauty of the Alaskan wilderness forms a backdrop for the genius of this film. Straying from outrightly stating the moral correctness of its protagonist, Into the Wild poises questions which continued to haunt me for weeks and weeks after seeing it. Add a wonderful score, a deeply meaningful story, and a director who obviously believes incredibly in his work, and you have one of the best films I have ever had the pleasure of watching.",8,4,7,17 March 2010
Toy Story," Toy Story: Thoroughly Entertaining
","With the ever increasing proximity of Toy Story 3, I decided it was about time for me to revisit the original and its first sequel to refresh my memory. Having been among the original target audience, it's a real trip back to childhood.The longtime favourite toy of young Andy, Woody is disgruntled to be pushed aside in favour of a new space-ranger action figure in the form of Buzz Lightyear. Admired by child and fellow toys alike, Buzz threatens Woody's territory, prompting an effort to remove him which results in the two being left many miles from home, with little time to get back before the family's move.Now regarded fondly as one of the best kids' movies of all time, Toy Story was the catalyst which allowed Pixar to rapidly ascend to the throne of animation where they dominantly remain to this day. Certainly it wowed me when I first saw it, almost fifteen years ago now. Indulging every child's fantasy that their toys come to life when they're not looking, we find ourselves instantly aligned with the host of strange characters. The quality of the animation, revolutionary for its time, is seen instantly, proudly boasted in the movements of the soldiers as they march downstairs. Everything looks completely realistic and, most importantly, believable. Whilst amusing beforehand, the laughs only really start to build up when Buzz arrives and we are treated to his interactions with Woody, the disagreements between the two and their petty arguments forming the basis of the film's funny factor. The added maturity of years affords the understanding of some of the film's more adult jokes, adding a little something extra to the experience for returning viewers. The action-adventure side of the plot keeps up the drama, tension, and sense of doom, keeping us wondering whether or not the reluctant duo will ever make it back in time. The scenes in Sid's house are the film's best, in terms of keeping up suspense. Their oddness is stand-out and ever memorable, the stranger toys therein encountered doubtlessly having haunted many little 'uns over the years. Certainly still enjoyable, Toy Story remains an inherently good film, though for me it stands less high than the likes of Wall-E, lacking the considerable emotional impact of that later Pixar effort.Carrying a vast legacy, Toy Story stands the test of time well, still as enjoyable as ever it was. Having paved the way for films which, as you would hope, took what it did and did them better, it is enduring, endearing, and thoroughly entertaining.",7,2,4,8 July 2010
Toy Story 2," Toy Story 2: Everything You Could Want
","Following on from the success of its predecessor, Toy Story 2 launched Pixar even further into the animation stratospere. It was only whilst deciding to watch this and the original in preparation for the upcoming third installment that I realised I had never, not even as a child, seen this before. Struggling to understand how, I rushed to right this wrong.Picking up a few years after the first left us off, Andy's toys live a happy coexistence with his new puppy. When a less functional member of their tribe is taken to the yard sale taking place at the front of the house, Woody mounts his canine steed in a rescue mission. Identified as a rare collector's item by a snooping customer, he is stolen, to be shipped to a museum in Japan. Cue the Buzz led rescue mission, and another miniature adventure.This one starts strongly, giving us action on a gargantuan scale before pulling back and revealing it to be a game played by Rex: a perfect reintroduction to the characters' world and the start of a recurring joke. We soon meet the puppy, the bark of whom closed the last installment, and see how he has been embraced as a member of the animated family. Things continue in much the same manner as the original, the style of humour all but identical, perhaps a bit more mature, as indeed was its target audience by its release. The same tone too is to be seen here, Woody's early setbacks much akin to his first despairing thoughts of abandonment upon Buzz's arrival. Once the primary plot gets rolling, we get the mix of action, adventure, comedy, and drama of the first all over again, with a whole host of new characters and settings. Particularly amusing and entertaining are the interactions of Buzz and the newer model of himself he finds, his role now reversed to that of Woody at the beginning of the first film in convincing the deluded toy that he is just that. Woody's story is marked by a nicely darker element of being someone's toy, and one which will undoubtedly resonate thematically with installment three. The last half hour or so is full-on action, suspenseful stuff which has everyone rooting for the heroes. Everything you could want for what it is really. Again, this provides a sufficiently compelling kids' film, but one which lack the emotional wow factor of such greats as Wall-E.Again, Pixar delivers a consistently entertaining movie which will doubtlessly fulfill the cinematic needs of all the kids who see it. Regarding its alleged increase in quality over its forbear, I tend to disagree, though it is very close. Having never seen it until recently, I guess this one just doesn't have the same sentimental legacy for me.",7,0,1,9 July 2010
Invictus," Invictus: Some Compelling Drama
","Despite my ferocious adoration of the films of Clint Eastwood, particularly the more recent ones with accomplished cinematographer Tom Stern, Invictus was a film I had avoided seeing, simply due to my complete disinterest in sport and inability to watch it. Finally, however, I was forced to put my dislike aside to get my Clint fix.Reliving the story of Nelson Mandela's early presidency, Invictus follows the newly elected leader's plan to unite his post-apartheid nation through the country's rugby team, a former symbol of the white oppressors. Collaborating with captain Francois Pienaar to establish the Springboks team as an institution which can be supported by all colours, Mandela sees World Cup victory as a much needed catalyst to healing the wounds of racial segregation.It is precisely in the above plot summary that one can find what turned me from getting to this film for so very long a time, the unifying power of rugby not something I exactly believed in whatsoever. That said, any collaboration between Eastwood and Stern is automatically compulsory viewing material for me, so huge a fan am I of the sum of their creative visions. And yet, I couldn't help but maintain a scepticism nevertheless. Opening with newsreels covering Mandela's release from prison and election to office mixed with shots of Freeman altered to look like the newsreel footage, Invictus does not dwell on the politics surrounding the election, preferring to begin instead with the new president's first day in office. We immediately see, as perhaps we ought to expect, the theme of race relations coming to the forefront of the film's focus. The presidential guard serves as the primary representation of the changing state of South Africa, the two colours begrudgingly forced to work together and eventually coming to trust, even like, one another. As Mandela comes to have his bodyguards overcome their prejudices and forgive those who did them wrong, so too does he slowly repair his country's damaged state, caused as it is by the distrust of decades of enforced segregation. The first thing to address must surely be the performances. As Mandela's personal choice, Freeman does a very fine job. Not usually much a fan of his roles, I was behind him the whole way. Damon too is on good form, better than I've known him to be in the past (his wonderful performance in Hereafter suggests that he works well with Eastwood). Fortunately for me, the scenes of rugby are minimal, far more time spent off the pitch than on. Now, as someone who really just doesn't get sport at all, I of course had no familiarity with this story, and no idea whether or not the Springboks would emerge triumphant. The fact that I was rather interested to find out says something about the film's tension, though I would be lying if I said I was shouting for them. What is impressive is that through the sweeping crane shots of thousands of faces cheering on their team and the images of black and white united together in mutual hope, I came to understand— if only slightly—why sport can mean so much to so many. And do believe me when I say that that really does say an awful lot.Though it falls far short of his best work, Invictus is a strong offer from Eastwood. As someone completely ignorant of its subject matter, the fact that I was made to be interested in the match, and even brought to understand the meaning of sport for people, does much to contribute to my appreciation of the film. It may not be a masterpiece, but it makes for some compelling drama.",7,0,0,29 April 2011
Up," Up: Just Fine
","Pixar's newest and arguably most well received film, Up swept the world with its mix of comedic and dramatic elements. Positively received by critics and crowds alike, it comes with a daunting reputation.Carl Fredricksen is a curmudgeonly pensioner, living alone in an increasingly urbanised environment following the death of his wife. When construction work damages his DIY mailbox, Carl strikes out, and is condemned to a retirement home as a result. Unwilling to leave his home, he uses thousands of balloons to lift the house away and fly to South America, as he once planned with his wife.The first ten to fifteen minutes of Up have become amongst the most famous scenes in recent cinematic history. Conveying a life of love and loss without words in such a short and simple scene, Pixar may well have accomplished their best work here. It is endearing, emotional, and engaging, immediately allowing us to forgive Carl's gruff exterior and meanness. After the involving start, however, things begin to follow a standard formula, with wicked villain, threatening henchmen, catchphrases and general conventions of children's films. This may be appropriate, given that the film is just that, but the potential purveyed in the opener unfortunately goes largely untapped. The remainder of Up, following its strong start, simply fails to live up to what it might have been. Jokes are mildly amusing, plot is insufficiently entertaining, characters are less than enduring. Though it functions just fine as a children's movie, it leaves a sense of disappointment behind it.With a strong start, Up promises much but fails to deliver the best. Entertaining despite this, it works as a way to pass the time and entertain the kids. Its beginning taken as a short might have made Pixar's best film, but as a whole it keeps the audience happy, if not thrilled.",7,0,0,1 April 2010
The Happening," The Happening: Woefully Acted, Barely Written and Just Absurd
","I suggested that my friends and I go to see this film in the cinema when it was released. As a result, I have never since been allowed to choose the film. The Happening concerns a mysterious phenomenon which is leading to mass death and causing wide-spread panic around the world. Mark Wahlberg plays a high-school teacher thrust into the middle of this emergency situation with his girlfriend, played by Zooey Deschanel. They are journeying across the country to escape 'the happening'. The premise is interesting to begin with, a message lying at the heart of the film. It is, however, taken beyond the point of redemption by Shyamalan. The script is simple, generic, unimaginative, boorish rubbish. Stupid, emotionless, and inhuman lines spoken by characters which might, with a degree of kindness, be described as two-dimensional. The relationships between them are entirely unbelievable and insincere. And the acting? Oh the acting... Wahlberg deserves a slap as the blandly irritating and vapid 'hero' who appears to have only a single tone of mundanity available to him as a voice, and Zooey Deschanel is... well, simply, Zooey Deschanel isn't. Having Wahlberg speak to himself would have been less painful (oh wait, he does try that). The 'expressions' of joy, fear, shock, and sadness upon Deschanel's face are entirely indistinguishable from each other, and indeed from emotion at all. Possibly the single worst 'performance' I have ever seen. To make matters worse, both characters seem more attached to turning their heads to the side than they are to each other. You'll think they're trying to get something out of their ears. Perhaps its the sound of the dialogue, clunky and tacky as it comes.Woefully acted, barely written, and just absurd, the only thing happening with The Happening is the steady flow of people leaving. Shyamalan continues his recent trend of awfulness, digging ever deeper his cinematic grave.",1,25,39,8 February 2010
Mystic River," Mystic River: Darkness, Depth, and Despair
","Mystic River is a film. Mystic River is directed by Clint Eastwood. Mystic River stars Sean Penn. Yeah, I was always gonna love this one...After the brutal murder of nineteen year old Katie, her ex-con cum businessman father Jimmy becomes reunited with childhood friends Sean, one of the detectives investigating, and Dave, one of the last people to have seen her alive. The disbanded trio are each haunted by a childhood trauma, the after-effects of which hang ominously over their shared modern horror.We begin with the aforementioned trauma, its unfolding simplistic yet harrowing. Almost before we have time to react, we find ourselves in the modern day, being introduced gradually to the grown up alternatives to the children we have just left behind, seeing their lives and what they have become. It's not long before what eventually transpire to be the highlights of the film make themselves abundantly clear: the concomitant undercurrent of darkness to every scene; the gloriously austere, subtle, almost incidental performance of Robbins; the characteristically exquisite excellence of Penn. The primary plot, that of the murder mystery, is nothing exceptionally compelling in itself, the film's appeal lying rather in those involved. The question of culpability takes a backseat, Eastwood trading the tension he could create for a wonderful depth and complexity of character which sets his film apart from the other less interesting displays of cheap fast-food-film which one despairingly finds throttling the genre. Under Eastwood's firm grip, the very fine script is guided to a perfect fulfillment of its potential, the ugly dankness of his more recent works rife within the film. The performances are nothing short of amazing, each actor bringing memorable elements to the film and not a single one of them out of step. The film's sole flaw is that Eastwood has done better. If almost anyone but he had made this, it would be career defining.Abound with astounding performances, darkness, depth, and despair, Mystic River is yet another medal of honour on the lapel that is Eastwood's career. An entertaining, if not always comfortable, viewing experience, it is not to be missed.",9,1,1,1 July 2010
Zombieland," Zombieland: A Pure Comedy, and Quite a Good One
","Now the most commercially successful zombie film of all time, Zombieland comes with an impressive reputation. Tackling a sub-genre more deeply mined than most, it attempts to do so in an original and interesting way.Zombieland concerns an apocalyptic world in which the main character, Columbus (named, like the rest of the characters, after his hometown), tries to survive regular onslaughts of zombies. Meeting others along the way he carries on, determined not to be eaten, by abiding to certain rules.The film is very very funny. Many laughs, consistent and effective, and well hitting. The rules are a great running motif, popping up in the background where necessary. Additionally, the editing is quite effective in creating laughs of its own, cutaways to other people and flashbacks adding much to the laugh factor. Performance-wise, the acting is great, particularly Eisenberg's, carrying the film well with his appropriate dorkiness. The now infamous cameo, which I won't name in case you're lucky enough not to know and want to retain your ignorance until viewing the film, steals the show with its brilliance: the perfect implementation of the film's style of humour. The plot is fine and nothing particularly original, but ultimately unimportant, the film more concerned with keeping us chuckling. All of the characters work quite well with each other, giving a good balance and range. The central love story, though not all that involving, is perfectly cute and amusing in itself. Harrelson's side storyline is one of the film's better elements, his search for Twinkies the perfect antithesis to his amusing yet surprisingly sad backstory.Good characters, great interaction, funny dialogue, consistent quality. Delivering all you can possibly ask of it and hitting all the right spots, Zombieland is a pure comedy, and quite a good one.",6,0,0,17 March 2010
Inception," Inception: Standard Action Film
","Reaping money like there's no tomorrow and rocketing to the top of IMDb to contend with even The Godfather and Shawshank, Inception has had nothing but success since its release. An incredible sceptic toward all things popular, especially in their earliest days, I fully expected this to be quite poor and overrated.Working as an independent dream-thief, Dom Cobb is tasked with the more difficult job of implanting a thought within the mind of a subject, the promise of reunion with the family from which he is estranged his motivation to do so. Forging a team of assorted talents, he plans an intricate network of dreams and deceit whilst simultaneously coping with increasingly realistic memories of the past.When a film garners almost universal acclaim and high rankings all around, discussion turns quickly away from the work itself, and more towards its accolades. Such is certainly the case with Inception, its current spot at number 3 on the top 250 as much the subject of discussion boards as the (soi-disant) intricacies of its plot. Like its predecessor in Nolan's filmography, The Dark Knight, Inception is now praised variously as genius, brilliant, revolutionary, and 'the greatest film ever'. Yet almost for every fanboy who screams the wonders of this sci-fi epic is a cynic, tutting with disapproval and angrily muttering about the decline of modern civilisation. What we're currently seeing is a replay of Nolan's fortunes just two years ago. Some call him the new Kubrick, others dismiss him as a glorified Michael Bay. The arguments between these two camps have been the subject of more discussion than the film's merits, or lack thereof; indeed such is the content of this 'review' so far. My point: people feel compelled by such acclaim to either love the film, or to hate it, leaving a disturbing imbalance in its ratings. Unless you take a stand and proclaim it ludicrous garbage, anything other than unending praise will see you labelled a thoughtless moron, incapable of artistic appreciation or sagacious thought. Those who rate it a 1 out of 10 are making a point, refusing to stand for overrating. The simple fact is that Inception is a good film: entertaining; interesting; superb looking; well-acted; well-directed. Is it a masterpiece? No, absolutely not. Its flaws are many, both logically and cinematically; its moments of brilliance few. Aside from excellent effects and anti-gravitational fight sequences, it holds insufficient emotional impact to transcend the general mediocrity of its genre: the heist thriller in essence. And that is it. The film is perfectly entertaining, but at no stage is it anything special. I enjoyed myself, but certainly see nothing within it to warrant such vigorous fanaticism. And the ending was silly, overused, and lazy.A key example of the way in which people forget what they really should be discussing, Inception has become naturally presumed as a deep and thoughtful movie, probing far into recondite things and leaving us to formulate our own theories and opinions. In truth it is a standard action film, delivering a solid chunk of appealing-to-the-eye entertainment (some of the best for a while), but little more. Its plot is complex rather than its meaning, a key mistake audiences will continue to make as they argue and bicker. I just wish people could sit back and enjoy the film, rather than messing their pants at every halfway decent movie that hits the screen.",7,9,18,21 July 2010
WALL·E," Wall-E: Beautiful in its Implementation
","The ninth film from animation kingpins Pixar, Wall-E comes with a considerable reputation. Boasting awards aplenty and an almost entirely positive critical reception, it adds much to the already significant commendations received by the studio.The film, a future parable, focuses on the eponymous robot and his single handed efforts to clean the world up after humanity has abandoned it, and their rubbish. We soon learn that mankind is orbiting in space, floating about in dozens of gigantic ships, awaiting the time when they may return to an again healthy world. We see the arrival of Eve, a scanner robot sent to Earth to detect signs of life. Wall-E, alone in the world with nothing but a cockroach and an old copy of 'Hello Dolly!', sees in her a chance to know something other than loneliness.Wall-E provides an emotional depth rarely achieved by live action films. The animation of the main character is astounding, the realisation of this originally perfunctory machine as a fully rounded personality a stunning achievement. Through the simplest of motions, we are from the start able to connect with the robot and understand the poignant loneliness of 700 years. It is difficult to believe just how involving, engrossing and spellbinding the character is, and all that without any form of dialogue. Amazing. Once the plot gets kicking, we are treated to humour aplenty, a perfectly entertaining story, and an appropriate underlying message. The laughs come in equal measure as the tears; Wall-E's clumsiness as effectively brilliant as his hopeless romanticism. The running motif of his desire to hold Eve's hand is wonderfully moving, as beautiful in its implementation as the emotional scope of his eyes.Incredible animation, an emotional depth unparalleled by its rivals, a perfectly fine plot, and an important message. Wall-E is a great, great film.",8,1,2,14 March 2010
Toy Story 3," Toy Story 3: The Pitch-Perfect Finale
","I mentioned in my reviews of both Toy Story and Toy Story 2 being in the original audience toward which these films were targeted. Indeed, it seemed the very same prospect for Toy Story 3, its plot element of Andy's departure for college mirroring my own, due for little over a month later than the film's release.Picking up some twelve years after the previous installment, Toy Story 3 explores the familiar toys' fears and doubts when it is revealed that Andy will be leaving for college. Many of the characters of the previous films have already been disposed of, and when the remaining toys find themselves mistakenly donated to a day-care centre rather than placed in the attic, they assume the same has become of them, refusing to believe Woody's insistence otherwise.Following on a highly successful pair of films over a decade later is never going to be an easy thing to do. Purists will bring an assumed cynicism, as so often they ought to; changing factors in audience expectations will surely result in some differences to the stories that were so loved the first time around; returning to something so beloved after so long a time surely cannot be a wise move. Most famously applicable to the first two Godfather films, the classically untouchable critically acclaimed masterpiece duo, there are few arguments to support a late return to a well-remembered franchise. Toy Story 3 handles this gracefully, its opening shot a direct invitation to nostalgia of the first. Naturally, the film is replete with callbacks to the first and second, never forgetting its cherished roots and always delicately careful to avoid doing anything to exploit or shame them. The opening scene is wonderful, another of the fantastical imaginative scenarios of young Andy, whom we thereafter observe aging through the years. It is a bittersweet beginning, the joy we see in the elaborate and hilarious Western parody of an opening scene soon replaced with a lamentative overtone, the inevitable out-dating of these toys dominating the overall mood. Not, that is to say, that the film isn't entirely packed with laughs throughout; many were the times I found myself short on breath. The primary plot takes on the form and conventions of a traditional genre (potential spoilers shall see me refraining from identifying precisely which), and this is a nice structure to give to the film. New characters become as beloved as old, unseen turns keep the narrative fresh, and a certain element of the film is genuinely quite terrifying. A certain scene toward the end of the film is shockingly dark, its complexity startlingly thought-provoking, disarmingly beautiful, and yet further evidence of the piece's resounding overall thematic darkness. Although we may laugh at the escapades in which the characters entangle themselves, there is the ever-present knowledge that at best, they are returning to be placed in a dusty attic for long-term storage. Many have considered this a parental allegory; the idea of 'our kid' growing up obviously reflects the ideas of being outgrown by somebody whom you've spent years in the company of. For me, as I suspect is the case for many others, the film reflects growing up, moving on, letting go of the past, and saying a fond farewell to childhood. Toy Story was one of the big movies of my earliest years, and here, fifteen years on, it is time for Andy, me, and my contemporaries to leave behind all that the memories of the original film represent. It is the kind of film which likely holds a personal resonance for most everyone who sees it, and certainly a film which bears no age limit, its universality another of the many facets of this fantastic work. Expect a warm trickle down your cheek in the final scene, the pitch-perfect finale sealing the cinematic legacy of this milestone trilogy.Dark in the vein of Pixar's more modern works, Toy Story 3 manages to combine the well established and beloved characters with a deeply dark emotional story, typically brilliant comedy, and a thought-provoking personal relevance which inevitably endeared me even more to it. Managing even to top the personally cherished Wall-E, Toy Story 3 is not only a worthy addition to one of cinema's most consistently excellent trilogies, it is its best.",8,0,1,5 February 2011
Cube," Cube: Full of Holes
","A low budget Canadian psychological thriller, Cube has garnered a cult following and something of a legacy in popular culture. After a long time, I finally got around to seeing this interesting looking film today.Deeply mysterious, Cube chronicles the story of seven different people as they travel through an apparently endless system of interlinked cube structures with six doors each to adjacent cubes. Relying on each others' individual characteristics and skills to get them through, they desperately attempt to escape their geometric hell.With a single claustrophobic set used for shooting , one undeniable thing about Cube is the originality of its premise. Reworking the concept of the maze thriller in all sorts of new dimensions, it brings an interesting newness to the subgenre. The potential presented in the early scenes of the film is large; the opening scene immensely entertaining and indicative of good things to come from the original and intriguing concept. The implementation of this idea is, however, cripplingly flawed. Suffering painfully all the faults of clunky and unrealistic dialogue, the film does little to improve it with some substandard performances. The characters, though mildly interesting, seem to react in entirely absurd ways at times, doing much to detract from the audience sympathy vote: Kazan, an autistic character, is often just offensively portrayed; Leaven, the 'math whiz', takes her time in trying to decide if multiples of 5 and 2 are prime numbers. The film is full of holes and massive flaws, turning it from a film of considerable potential to, at times, an infuriatingly contrived work. All that aside, it is actually quite enjoyable once you accept and expect its regular absurdity. Plot twists are painfully obvious, but the path to them is at least a fun one to tread, some of the tensions rising between characters interesting, if not effective or believable. Though it does little to establish itself as a particularly good movie, it's at least not a terrible one.With flaws aplenty, many of them just silly and stupid, Cube falls flat on its face more than once, suffering regularly from its less than convincing dialogue and unintentionally funny developments. Entertaining all the same, it's certainly original.",4,22,37,2 April 2010
The Social Network," The Social Network: A Fitting Modern Treatment
","A movie about Facebook? A movie about Facebook?! Not even the bottom of the barrel could be so lined with mawkish garbage as this, a film following the foundation of a bloody website. Have they no better ideas? My thoughts exactly, dear reader. My thoughts exactly.Dumped by his girlfriend, who finally recognises his apparently incurable horridness, Mark Zuckerberg slanders her on the internet and creates a website for comparing the attractiveness of female Harvard students. The success of this and the invitation to programme a Harvard-exclusive online social network combine in the mind of the professed genius to create what would become Facebook, and the eventual pair of lawsuits that would turn up along the way.Like just about everyone else, I was incredibly sceptical toward such an idea as a Facebook movie: surely a ridiculous concept for any film. The involvement of well-liked screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and acclaimed director David Fincher seemed to win a great deal of sceptics over to the premise, yet I remained unchanged, dismissing it as uninteresting and silly. A website's success warrants a film now? Pfft... The scene which opens the film is the one in which Zuckerberg is dumped, the particular posterior-based vulgarity applied by the departing girlfriend the general label hung upon him by many of the film's characters. Jesse Eisenberg portrays Zuckerberg, combining the flashy sarcasm of Sorkin's dialogue with his own cynical glances of self-assumed intellectual superiority to create a character that we never quite get to like. His sneering put-downs alienate us as they do their recipients, preventing all from ever really sympathising with the computer maverick. And so too it should be, the protagonist—if even that title can rightly be applied to him—portrayed as largely deserving of the general disdain held by most toward him. The narrative is structured as flashbacks told through two contemporaneous depositions as the now multi-billionaire Zuckerberg is sued by both the proposers of the original website idea and his former best, quite probably only, friend Eduardo Saverin. The reason behind the former suit is evident, the latter initially unknown. Both Zuckerberg and Saverin appear to maintain a cordial respect for each other, never quite making eye contact and each appearing sorry that this is what their friendship has come to. As Saverin, Andrew Garfield is perhaps the film's strongest facet, his performance as the popular guy still faithful to his nerdy friend reaching a splendid climax in the scene wherein we finally learn the reason behind the lawsuit. Eisenberg and Garfield play off each other very well, the tension between them when the latter's character is accepted into a social club greatly desired by the former left to subtlety rather than a more visceral reaction on either part. Throughout the film, the comedy of the script plays a key supportive role, keeping us thoroughly entertained with Sorkin's quick-fire wit. It's not all heavily quotable one-liners, however, the simple story of friendship the film's thematic core. By its finale, as Zuckerberg sits alone in the deposition room, we are left to wonder if his newly amassed multi-billion dollar fortune has really changed anything. Riches, as his ex-girlfriend might argue, do not an asshole unmake. An old and well explored parable it may be, but it is given a fitting modern treatment here.A movie about Facebook? A movie about Facebook?! No, actually. A movie about friendship, about jealousy, and about the destructive influence of one upon the other. Perhaps the explanation for the somewhat exaggerative praise heaped upon this film lies in the fact that such an initially bizarre idea has—through a well written script and powerful performances—become so much more.",7,0,0,5 February 2011
