E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," The most overrated movie ever made
","This was nothing but a glorified kiddie movie. It wasn't a Disney film, but it might as well have been. All that was missing was Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. It was a sappy mess and should be banned.I was duped into believing that this was the next sci-fi classic, perhaps another Star Wars. I sure missed the mark on this one.I should have asked for a refund. Steven Spielberg should be ashamed of himself for putting out this piece of garbage. This should have been an After School Special, not a feature film During it's initial release I remember many people would make you out to be a terrible person if you expressed the slightest displeasure towards it. E.T. phone home? Please disconnect that phone.",1,29,68,13 July 2010
