Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," just wrap the film into the popcorn basket and leave it
","This film like all other films these days has the same things that people are addicted to watching.Some adventure which is not quite an adventure and some Blondie's's private parts.In this case it is Penelope Cruz who was not at all required in the film.Ian Mc Shane also was not quite required in the film.All the stunts were very ordinary stunts.The script was revolving round and round.The camera was pointing to Cruz's CLEAVAGE right from the first shot.script-0;direction-5,cinematography-no need ....The film as is believed is inspired from a DIsneyland ride.There are times when the film does get a grip on you but then some stupid stunts take away the pleasure of it.The director desperately tries to keep the Depp-Cruz chemistry alive repeatedly by separating them and bringing them back again.",5,1,3,22 May 2011
Skyfall," Finally Bond's essence comes back on the screen!!!!
","Skyfall brings back the Bond we know.The quite ,cunning and never ever giving up Bond.Not the sexy,style icon Brosnanisc Bond or hard hitting Craigist.This Bond is classy ,loyal and emotional.The films begins with a fantastic action sequence although action sequences stretched more expose the brainlessness in it.We are then taken to China where the plot thickens!!!!!.The title track is also very much classy.The best part is there are no love scenes in the film which had off late threatened the Bond films.Javier Bardem enters much late and rightly so.He has a major impact on the film.This film is well directed.No sensations . Finally one of the best Bond films indeed.Direction-9;Story-6;Cinematography-6",7,0,9,3 November 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Good movie ruined by special effects
",The hobbit begins on a good note with the characters well placed.I having read the book could surely enjoy the aura that it initially creates.But the movie has not done justice to the way it ends.the film is more about the character of every character in the movie but the director who did a great job with the TINTIN has gone back to create a blockbuster.The intent is to create a blockbuster of a movie from a very famous book.Too much of special effects have ruined the movie at the end although the GOLLUM character still intrigues me.This movie did not need a 3 part epic fantasy to finish.I am believing that they may be too boring.Direction-7;cinematography-7;script-7,6,11,23,16 December 2012
Avatar," a revolutionary,spelbounding and cinematic film
","well avatar is probably the second or the third best film of the decade i have seen.After this film one could see a significant rise in the number of 3-D films.That's why i say it's a revolutionary film in erms of trend that even Harry Potter is going to be a 3-D film.Script wise it's great.Being a hindu i can understand where and how his avatar is used in the film.The whole idea of going into a different galaxy and communicating with the natives becoming an avatar is brilliant.That too the avatar in hindu is a savior and here also he is a savior.Cameron rightly said that avatar is inspired from Ramayan .film-9.6,script-10,cinematography-10.Many people will say that it was all CGI but tell me how many films which use CGI are good as avatar.",9,2,4,17 July 2010
Inception," most intelligent film of the decade.............wow!!!!!!!
",this is Nolan's best film .Great script followed by good climax.I like things out of the box and let me tell you this is brilliantly out of the box.the first half is the set up to the film but the second half is like a page turner .It sets your pulses high.The crew is quite same as from the batman series but i don't see the reason why Bale couldn't have played the lead.Probably Di Caprio has done something beyond his chocolate boy image. film-9.6 direction-10 cinematography-8 Actually this film is quite better than the batman series of his.Memento .....well i think it is better than Memento.Finally a film which you just don't wrap up in a pop corn and leave it in the cinema hall.,9,3,8,17 July 2010
X-Men: First Class," last of my CGI era films
","please understand that you buy ticket to watch a film and not a circus full of stunts.Please understand that these films deliver the same packages over and over ......only now 3-d from 2-d.This film right from the first scene told the audience that it is going to be abut Erik.Then the same things happen over and over again......he has to come back and avenge his tormentor.script-0,direction-0,cinematography-4(CGI...or whatever) THIS IS LAST OF MY CGI FILMS.......I AM GIVING UP ON THEM .......I AM NOT ADDICTED TO THEM......James McAvoy suits in his image of being intelligent guy.Michael Fassbender in his angry man role suits good.All other characters are side kicks.....and guess what HUGH JACKMAN has a 5 second role in the film.",4,4,9,16 June 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Still can't beat Christopher Reeve's Superman..........
","I am not in a mood to pit this movie against any other but i was made to think of Superman of the old and then i realized why that film is still superior and still the best comic book film ever made.This film also revolves around the same Superman 2 essence where the villain from the past returns and forms allegiance with a new villain ,Bane in this case to destroy the main character.The films ending particularly for me is anti-comic book genre and more TV soapie type where there is a twist in the tale.Instead of ending the film with Talia Al'Ghul's revelation the film could have ended with Bane's death.He simply dragged the film for a grand finale.The film has ended with Robin now taking the charge(probably)....i wonder if the series continues........",6,2,7,21 July 2012
Cloud Atlas," Good film after a long time!!!
","After a long time there comes a movie with some thought in it.The writers have done a good job in bringing the book onto the screen .The film defies the old fashioned conventions of the same ending and this time gives us a reason to be involved in it.The story is told non linearly.One will have to follow from the beginning to the end to fully understand the film.The film is thematic ,rhythemic and does not revolve around any character or plot.But just flows in one direction.All you have to do is ride on.Tom Hanks suits every role in this film and so does Halle Berry.The film starts from past to present to future and is an epic adventure.This is a long movie but not one minute do you take your eyes off it.Direction-8;Story-8,Cinematography-7A good film in a long time.",7,21,41,27 October 2012
