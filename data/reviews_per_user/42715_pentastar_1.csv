The Ring," Takes you on a ride, never finishes what it started...
","Just a few words on this flick...it kept your attention almost to the end, then failed to deliver on what it spent the past hour building up to. Very frustrating, waiting for even a semi-resolution that never shows up.And people are giving this film an average of 7.5?  I don't think so. A 3 for the effort, but that's all.",3,0,1,9 March 2003
