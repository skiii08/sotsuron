Casablanca," Magnificent in story
","As much as I loved the story, and as much as I respect the great actors in the movie, the actings seemed a bit forced and unrealistic in some scenes; maybe not as good as the movie itself. That said, they still did a great job.What I loved the most about the movie is how characters' personality in the movie are introduced, but not changed as story goes. As if they were rigidly written first, and then the scenes and the storyline were adapted to fit those personalities. Seems easy to understand why this might be the best thing about the movie, not the amazingly depicted cafe, not the fantastic markets, and not even the beautifully played and sang musics.The Paris flash-back in my view was either too short to be of any signifacnt importance, better said, too short for demonstrating any glorious memories, or too long for such an obviously implied back-story and, of course, chemistry and romantic tensions observed in prior and further scenes.The battle of sentimentalism is a never fought one here. This is how well-written the characters are.Thank you for making such a great movie Mr. Curtiz.",8,1,3,22 March 2019
In Bruges," Let's go to Bruges!
","As Roger Ebert has put fantastically, if this movie doesn't affect you in anyway, it will urge you to visit Belgium and its Bruges!
I love how this movie now seems like an offensive film on many levels. The terms said and things shown in this movie can be very politically incorrect.
What I liked about the movie is that even the unnecessary scenes in this movie are delightful. The story itself is very clever and the way it's told is clever as well. The morality involved in this movie is quite challenging and influencing. Even the lowest of the low have standards in their ethics. This can be seen in many significant moments of the movie.
I loved the brutally real comedy in the movie. it's not that it is meant to be a comedy, but it is funny. Just how life itself is. Loyalty is the other great element in this movie and somehow I feel is the same as the standards.
The most important elements in the movie, I think, are survival instincts and self-image. After watching this movie, you'll have some questions about life. And this is how powerful the movie is. acting is adequately good, and the music is just fit for such landscapes.",9,2,2,31 March 2019
Citizen Kane," A 1941 15! An all-time 8.5!
","You can read longer reviews elsewhere. Here's a brief one:
Simple movie, raises one unnecessary question which is answered slowly like a jigsaw puzzle, with the key-piece missing: Rosebud
Painting an obsessive narcissistic proud man-child with abandonment issues who has all the money in the world. The sarcastic determined man with no real goal, but to make at least one person love him if not everyone.
Had Mr. Thompson found what 'rosebud' meant, the movie would have been an absolute waste and the story line would have been pointless; as he could have gone to the Xanadu first! Yet, I had goosebumps when he didn't find the meaning and used the jigsaw puzzle metaphor. 'Rosebud' was the answer of every question he had in his life: it was the only thing he'd ever truly owned, as in not bought! So, it could have been the gift he could give Suzanne to prove his love for her was more than just a possessive narcissistic one.I loved the theatrical acting in this movie, set decoration, makeup, music, the way the story jumped back and forth yet easily traceable.
Notice that from the beginning you know everything there is to know about the life of Kane, very shortly. Then, you'll get an episodic longer one.",8,0,1,5 April 2019
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino's surreal history, is a blood and humor filled fine work
","What would you expect when you hear the name of Tarantino? Exciting story, amazing story telling and unique features in cinematography. Mixed with a lot of blood and humor to make fun of violence. Of course, this movie would have been completed without the masterful acting of one Mr. Christoph Waltz. Playing a highly intelligent detective, ambitious, and very polite. Sort of simultaneously the protagonist and the antagonist. You're supposed to hate him but he's kind of lovely.I have a few problems with the movie. Strange accents of the actors when imitating southern American accent, and British. What is the point of an American actor doing a British accent in a multi-language film?
There's a set of unnecessary dialogues in the cinema, many shorter versions could have been shown.
The dynamic of the movie is about trust. Clearly shown that humans are not kind to each other when the shoes are on the other foot. Ironically, shoe fitting is a particularity in this movie.
As much as makeups and costumes, set decoration, and design, I have to raise my hat.",7,1,3,17 April 2019
The Danish Girl," Why didn't this movie get the attention it deserves?
","Let's get to it confidently and frankly. We're in the age of political correctness, and many people find it difficult to adjust to new terms. This movie was released 4 years before the sensitivity of today's political correctness. I could only say that this movie was released a few years too soon.Having said that, about the story itself, it goes back to 1926. Just try and imagine how was the public approach to this sensitive topic back then. So, before continuing reading this, this movie is about a very delicate topic and inspired by a true story. The first transgender goes through with a complex surgery of gender transformation. So, if this is not something you are comfortable with, do not watch this movie. Or, have a very open view about it.Warning: It's really hard to talk about this movie without mentioning 'spoiling' scenes. So please, try and don't read what's *between stars*. And if you're the type of person who enjoys reading a complete review before watching a movie ignore the said warning.To me, this is a brilliant movie, and I can see that it might not be a popular one. Everything in this movie is a part of the story, and what is a movie but an audiovisual story? From the first scene, one can realize multiple introducing elements about 'Einar' and 'Gerda'.
Einar is the masterful observant painter, and quite a perfectionist, one might even say obsessive. Einar and Gerda are not just in love or just husband and wife; they're best friends. Einar's fondness of women's fabrique is easily shown in 'his' touches and gasps that comes with them. *Notice the way Einar's face changes when sensing the texture that reminds 'him' of her true self*. Einar's perfectionism depicted in many scenes, *painting a landscape over and over to find the right color for the snow, or fixing Gerda's lipstick*, might in fact be the reason that leads her to be as courageous, intrepid and hopeful towards one of the hardest struggles of her life; find herself. Eddie Redmayne has done a perfect job bringing both Einar and Lili to life, to the point that you may get confused as if Eddie went through with this just as her character did. And you may wonder, why didn't he win the Oscar? You can know all about that, asking for a Mr. Leonardo Di Caprio's The Revenant.Gerda is the boss, she's in control both in work and personal relationships. She has a dominant presence and controls her surroundings. Well-deserved Oscar winner Alicia Vikander shows a magnificent talent to realize Gerda. Gerda is in love, and she's in control. *Yet, her dilemma begins when she sees Lili kissing Hans. That's when she understands this has gone too far; she has lost control*.
*My appreciation for the heartbreak Lili has when she realizes Hans knows the 'real' person in women's disguise, and he likes Einar and not her is very difficult for me to describe. What is emphasized also later that Hans is a homosexual*. Here is the only reason I deducted a point from the perfection; there could have been more discussions about sexuality in this movie. I figured the topic is complicated enough that Hooper, the director, may have intentionally dismissed it.
Costume design and set decorations are incredible in this movie, displaying Copenhagen, Paris, and Dresden, railway stations and hospitals are meticulously perfected. If it hadn't been for the academy's great deal of appreciation for Mad Max: Fury Road, The Danish Girl could have won these two recognitions as well.Acting in this movie is fantastic. Landscapes, and most of the dialogues too. *Goosebumps, even behind my neck, when Lili asks for a night dress, rejected by 'Lili never stays the night', responding 'doesn't matter what I wear, when I dream, it's Lily's dreams' *; this is probably my favorite scene.This is a very important story to be told, and Hooper did a good job doing it. if, as some critiques wrote, this movie was such a mainstream one, the ratings would be at least as good as action movies. Clearly, there is many biased opinions about this movie, just as there is a lot of hatred towards the transgender community. Remember what's said: 'haters gonna hate'.",9,0,2,31 March 2019
Spotlight," What A great movie! Such an Important one!
","Great Acting, great direction, great story, great screenplay. Well-deserved motion picture of the year, transfers you to America's late 90's and early 2000's. An absolutely necessary movie to watch, and what a great job is done making this movie. I feel there is not enough emphasize on what an incredibly perfect movie this is. Easily, it can be put among the best-ever-made movies.
The only reason I didn't gave a full score was the fact that I have seen better movies, maybe lack of score and music as great as the movie itself, that's all.The way Tom McCarthy tells the story of a team of journalists shedding light on of the most controversial topics of the world is, in one word, brilliant. The scenes are perfectly juxtaposed. No surprises in this movie, just pure shock! If there's a bit of humanity in you, you'll be blown away watching this story.
With regard to production, 6-Oscar nominee has done a great deal of work, creating tangible atmosphere. No unnecessary scenes in this movie. Everything is fit!Acting as I've mentioned before, is just how I love it: realistic, bold and adequate. What performances by Marc Ruffalo, and Rachel McAdams. I've always thought of these two as OK actors, but, they have shown a vastly higher class of acting in this one. Micheal Keaton, is as good as ever, and Liev Schrieber plays a very different character than his Ray Donovan, yet as strong and bold. And can we applaud the most underrated actor in this movie:
Brian d'Arcy James
I am mesmerized by his performance, yet he didn't receive the attention he deserved.Please watch this movie and be shocked by it. Then, really think about what it's trying to tell you. And, then, you'll realize how important this movie is.",9,0,0,5 April 2019
Alien," As good as you'd expect it to be
","The important thing to have in mind when watching this movie is paying attention to the movie itself, story, atomosphere and horror, much more than the acting, music and dialogues. Not to omit, this is 1979, a great deal of work has put into this movie.
Remarkable scene decor and fantastic designs of the ship, rooms, vessels, equipment and the planet(!). I loved everything about this movie regarding the set. Panavision, indeed, has done a great job providing the crew with space to be creative, and what an incredible job by the crew!
Well-desereved award winning movie, transfers us into a commercial spaceship and then will let us alone in the dark space, experimenting with our survival instincts.
8 years later oscar nominee Sigourney Weaver, who played the leading actress, to me was rigid, forced and a bit artificial in her role. Her character, however, is particularily a favorite of mine, following rules and taking control when necessary, judging others and a deep suspicion that is just fit for her. Adequetly brave, as in not adventurous enough to take unnecessary risks, but brave enough to push her limits. While I get the shuttle scene where she's in her revealing top and the smallest panties they could find for her, indicating a finally-achieved moment of redemption, I don't get the necessity for the small panty! Is that really comfortable?Let's talk about ash, everything about Ash is disturbing from the beginning, to the point that there are naked pictures and magazines on his desk. Does anyone understand why he tried to put the magzine in her mouth? Even as what he was, he should have been more efficient with his killing/smothering methods.To movie, this movie is great in production, not so great in other aspects. 7/10.",7,2,2,23 March 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Much better than I thought!
","When you see the long title, it may seem discouraging. However, natural calmness of the city in question, adjoined its opposite nature, creates a beautiful chaos and drama. Simpler than it may seem, a disturbed mother and a divorcee demands justice for her troubled daughter's even more troubling murder case.
Much like his 'In Bruges', McDonagh has done yet another incredible job picturing the calm and charm of a certain city, and then he disturbs you with whatever can be wrong with the city, deeper than its surface.I didn't know Sam Rockwell before this movie and what a great opportunity this movie is to be introduced to him. Unlike another Oscar winner in this movie, Frances McDormand, from whom I had watched other movies before and enjoyed her acting. The combination of these two and Oscar winner Woody Harrelson, was really good. Frances portrays Mildred, a woman in her 50's, in a bad relationship with everyone and the world. Sarcastic, determined and in the verge of anarchism caused by trauma.As far as my rating for this movie goes, I didn't like two important things in this movie: 1- the scene with the gazelle seems absolutely unrealistic, even the CGI isn't that good. Additionally, Frances' acting drops from its award winning quality and her speech with the animal is absolutely weak.
2- the son is ever present in the movie in most of the important scenes, but without any explanation whatsoever, he's removed from everything in the last 40 minutes.All in all, it's a beautiful movie to watch and a very good story; specifically, the opening 30 minutes. The storytelling and cinematography are notable. Characters are relatable, and not black and white, but grey and lovable.",8,1,2,6 April 2019
Bridge of Spies," A realistic and stressful drama!
","It is not that common a movie absorbs you with its story, but when it does, you could feel living inside it and experience it as it goes. Tom Hanks' acting is as good as ever and Mark Rylance's performance is absolutely incredible for which he won the academy Awards for best actor in a supporting role.
It's a movie about legal confidentiality in the years of the cold war, before Berlin's wall was broken. East Germany is highly under the Soviet union's influence, and a lawyer is responsible for trading lives between US, USSR and East Germany.
It's easy to watch as the rhythm of the movie never slows down more than a few seconds. Music is adequately good for the movie, Oscar Nominated.
I've never been a fan of Coen Brothers, and I've seen many of their originals. I liked their screenplay for this movie better than the others. Steven Spielberg's patriotism once again is dominating in this movie.
So, if you are one of those people who'd enjoy watching a movie based on a true story, full of dialogues, monologues, great acting, good music, and a lot of nervousness, this is your type of movie. I deducted a few points for I'd never watch this movie again, didn't love the directing, and I think there were unnecessary exaggeration in some scenes.
However, I loved that you'll know about the situation and what is going on in many scenes just as the protagonist knows and understands: if he's waiting, you're waiting, if he's scared, you're scared, and if he's nervous about what is going to happen, you'd feel the same. The amount of empathy you'd feel for this movie's characters is very much in many scenes. Other scenes, on the contrary, somehow hard to feel any empathy.All in all, watch this movie, there's a reason it's been nominated for many awards, and as much as Spielberg's involvement, the quality of production is never below a certain point which makes it, still, a good movie to enjoy and a good story to listen to.",7,0,0,5 April 2019
Warrior," It was a Joke!
","OK fans, just hear me out.First, why Tommy made up with his dad?because Tommy liked him better when he was drunk? Second,why movie waits a long long time to tell you what was happened in 'THE TAPE'? let's skip a bit. Main flaws: Brandon was tired like hell, he got beat up in his previous matches, suddenly he Wins against COBA the Russian! OK that's fine!I believe you!the guy never lost, and then a physics teacher knock him out!!! Other side, Tommy fought just for 10 seconds in total, before the final!Final match: 2 brothers against each other... one is exhausted, one is fresh like a new day vegetable! How the hell Tommy didn't finish him up like the others??? I just Don't get it. It was a joke to me my friends. This whole movie is based on a 'brother killing' philosophy!but only one of the brothers has this philosophy!it's a very bad movie! I cant understand why everyone is so happy with this! it's full of flaws! not in the directing and acting of course,but a lot in the screen play!!!!even the fight scenes are very bad! and I can't find out why is it on the top 250! thanks!",2,6,13,2 July 2014
The Lego Movie," Tops your expectations.
","I didn't want to watch this movie, I did because one of my friends insisted on it! After only 3 minutes, I was hooked!
It's not a simple childish animation, although very bright and shiny which will be the snack for your eyes. However, there are clear mature messages in the movie; rather political and social.
Of course it's a masterpiece made with legos and an incredible amount of hard work has been put into making it. I loved the new ideas they have maintained in the movie and the characters are just lovely. Don't make any mistakes. I'm not saying 'you could learn a lot from the characters' actions because they are so realistic and connecting', but they have a lot to offer.
Voiceover for his movie is just brilliant, the blind guy who is basically a prophet/god figure is Morgan Freeman; isn't he that character already?
And, compliments to all the other voices; significantly, Mr. Will Arnet and Will Farrel! Amazing!
Now, you have to understand this is still an animation, so if you're not into it, it might not be interesting.
Also, how cool is that Lonely Island was nominated for an Oscar because of 'everything is awesome' soundtrack?If you still don't know lonely Island, do yourself a favor, put their names on google and let the amusement and surprise commence!All in all, definitely recommend this.",9,0,1,25 April 2019
Aliens," Better than the first one?
","There a few franchises that have a better '2nd' than the first. Maybe with time, the crew gathered enough experience and knowledge to do a more comprehensive job. I liked the story better, as well as the actings! Design and the set was as perfect as the first movie.What I don't understand is the use of a certain word in one of the last scenes; absolutely unnecessary. I watched the extended 150+ plus minutes, and I have to say it's worth it.
And as far as my problem with the 'small panty' in the first movie: it has been solved in the second one.
The storyline maybe is more commercial than the first movie. One might say even more heroic. I really like strong female characters which this movie has even more than the previous one.
Sigourney's 'Ripley' is better than before; Portrayed in a better way.To be honest, the reason I came close to watching this movie was the MKX video game in which you can play 'Alien' as a fighting character. Incredibly strong in the game.Aliens, is the developed Alien story with all the good things from the first movie.",8,1,4,24 March 2019
American History X," What a performance!
","This movie has been finally crossed off of my watchlist. Apart from the fact that it's kinda clear how the story will develop, I have nothing against this movie. You can really tell what exactly will happen in each scene, so no big twists or surprises. However, the story is good enough to keep your focus in tact.Mr. Norton has shown his great range, and ability for long monologues. What I ejoyed about the movie is the variety of scenes, certainly took them a long time to prepare all the locations.I'm not sure if this movie is re-watchable, for my taste it has been too strong and long, that said, I understand if so many other people would watch it more than once.It's a great piece on not only Neonazism but rasism itslef, and what rasicm may bring to a society. It emphasizes on the great dangers of prejudices among all races which is not exclusive to a certain country or skin color, even sadder!
I was wondering how easily the adolescent could be radicalized, and how important it is to educate them properly; specifically, parents' role in this. With everything going on in the world, now, watching this movie is for sure justified and well-advised for it shows a great deal of radicalized, emotionally abused, and hyped-up actions and their inevitable consequences.",8,0,1,24 March 2019
Jackie," It's a good movie with a shining star's brilliance.
","I've watched this movie just because of Portman's amazing acting skills. Easily one of my favorite actors of all time. The story is known one, but from a different perspective maybe, the whole story moves quiet naturally, and you can see the slow progress.
Cinematography in this movie is beautiful. Make up, hair and dresses are fit.
All in all, it's a good biographical movie about one of the most critical moments in US history. In case you enjoy this type, you'd enjoy this movie compounded with amazing acting skills of Natalie Portman.",6,0,0,1 June 2019
The Pianist," A movie to remember, a movie to love
","If I'm being honest, that's probably my best experience with Roman Polanski's art. Speaking of how smoothly the story is told. And, how it challenges our limits, demonstrating everything a director can, murdering, humiliation, free labor/slavery, children starving.
Heavy elements in the movie. Hope and despair and survival.
Maybe more than anything else, I loved that it showed both good and bad actions of Jews and Nazis. Of course it's not even close to a competition when counted, but the fact that it was there cannot be denied. There were some people who abused their friends at some point, and there were people mistreating each other for a little bit more food, and a little bit more prosper in those desperate times.
On the contrary, as brutally displayed the Nazis' actions, I love to think that there is a little bit of humanity inside of everyone and this is shown more than one occasion.
On the same note, isn't wrath, greed, and genocide only observed in humans?
I mean, maybe it is human to kill other people, and it needs something more than that to stop it.
I loved the drama in this movie, many powerful phrases such 'Food is more important than time' and the music. What a lucky life we have to experience the music in this movie.
And, well done to well-deserved Oscar winner Adrian Brody.watch this movie, watch it so you'd appreciate your life as well.",8,0,1,30 March 2019
Amadeus," Watch it, enjoy it, love it! Repeat!
","To be fair, this movie doesn't even touch the more known Mozart's works, yet it's a glorious way to celebrate his music, if not his legacy.The story is told by a seemingly mad man, Antonio Salieri, the Emperor's teacher who loves music more than anything else in this world. He has a lot of 'self-image' issues, and when he's faced the reality of Mozart's existence, he's lost his faith in God, and himself. The abstinent musician, falls in love with Mozart's work, while simultaneously proves his-self unworthiness. That's a hard paradox for his appreciating jealous mind to handle. So, the double identity, as a coping mechanism to his respective mediocrity begins. He is allegedly Mozart's best friend, who little 'Wolfie' knows, has sabotaged his work and even made an indecent proposal to his wife. Secretly, he's Mozart's biggest admirer. He confesses it many times himself.He's broken in his soul, more than Mozart was ever broken financially.
Try to love Costanza, ingenuous woman with a heart of gold who loves Mozart very much. Mozart himself is portrayed like a very proud, bold and almost pertinent man-child who has no respect for anything but his music, not even money; profligately throws his life away in debts.Beside the fantastic acting of the two important roles, costume design, music, makeups, and whatever else this movie has excelled to set the bar, Milos Forman's way of story telling is yet another masterpiece of his that puts Amadeus high up and close to his other masterpiece; One flew over the cuckoo's nest. He, once again, shows a great deal of artful directing, having mastered directing a big crowd. 2:40 hours and not even once you feel bored when watching this movie. Also, he's decided on giving Wolfgang a signature laugh that stays with you, that I promise.Back to the story, the priest is broken in the end, just listening to Salieri's subtle sinister; imagine Salieri's torture for 32 years living that story.It's such a good movie, and this is not only my opinion, the Academy has acknowledged this radiant of a movie with a lot of trophies.Do yourself a favor, watch this movie.",9,1,1,22 April 2019
Once Upon a Time in America," A trilogy in one
","Unlike the movie I'm gonna keep it short.
Amazing casting, wonderful screenplay, great storytelling, and the cherry on top would be maestro's work, Enio Moricone. Even loved the 'Yesterday' and what it implied.
I didn't like the actings in the first 6 minutes of movie, and in general the sound mix and edit wasn't as good as the movie itself.
It's a trilogy, starting in the early 30's and ending in the late 60's.
Whatever had to be told, is vastly explained with meticulous detailing. Some may find it hard to understand the opening 20 minutes of the movies, but I think implications are strong enough to connect the dots and sort out the storyline, although not that obvious.
Makeups, clothes and set design in this movie are just examples of masterpieces. I gave it 8/10 simply for the long narrative, poor sound edit (respectively) and mediocre actings of anyones but the chief roles.
I kept it spoiler free, however, I feel like there is lot to talk about; specifically, some certain scenes. Maybe in another life, huh?",8,1,5,30 March 2019
Mystic River," Lower than my expectations!
","I'd say it's a good movie right from the start. But, then again it's a bit slow and everything is very clear from the beginning and even when you think is not, you'd reach to the exact conclusion as the story line. I mean, the truth is right there, Clint Eastwood and the writers just feed you, not deliberately, misleading information. With which you'd only guess ok that cannot be the whole story.
However, actings are impeccable. Music is just absent, or to be neglected. And then, there are a few unnecessary exaggerated kissing in the movie. It just doesn't fit. About the last scene: I guess it's demonstrating a certain type of relationship that doesn't exist in other mentioned ones throughout the movie; if you notice the whole movie is based on the fundamental message of it.
All in all, it's talking about one the most important issues of our society which I'm not mentioning to keep it spoiler free.",7,0,0,17 May 2019
Raging Bull," Why? Why? Why?
","I've always loved a struggle story. Some of my favorite movies are box related; not particularly because of the sport itself. There are a lot of similarities between this movie and 'the fighter' and a lot of differences; obviously.
What you can expect from this movie is in the title. Just worth mentioning: thank god we are passed that whole misogyny and patriarchy era.
Raging bull is the story of a delusional champion drowned in his rage.
Acting in this movie is beyond my understanding. If you're a fan of boxing though, the boxing might be unique, yet could have been done in a better way.
The champion's relationships in this movie are heavily emphasized; especially, the one he has with his own thoughts.
Very smooth story telling, not bored a second throughout the whole movie. Congratulations for all the awards this movie has won; they speak for themseltves.",8,1,1,26 July 2019
Trainspotting," Just watch it and don't expect significance
","Don't get angry! What I meant is there's nothing significantly fantastic about this movie (aka, no significant actor, music, dialogues,...), yet doesn't mean it's not a good movie. Definitely, a lot of the scenes in the movie are hard to forget. Additionally, as a whole, everything is a fit. Music, casting, acting and scenes are well fit together, creating a wonderful composition.I like the occasional surreal of the story. And, as much as I love the story as a whole, the movie itself fails to convey the high amount of emotions involved in many of some particular scenes. Omitted, or just doesn't matter at all. The story is told by a sociopath junkie, maybe that's the reason for negligence of some conveying?So far, this has been the best movie of Boyle that I have ever watched. Thankfully, I was lucky to see it, washing out my uncommon bad experience with Slumdug Millionaire.",8,2,4,26 March 2019
Heat," 1.5 hour of action boredom, 1 hour of excitement.
","It's weird that an action movie can you bore you, to the point that you may need to push through it to get to the amazing parts. The movie raises a lot of unanswered questions in the first 1.5 hour, so it's only natural that you feel confused. Yet, in 1 hour when every piece of the puzzle is set together, amazingly but not surprisingly, this movie becomes one of the most intense movies you've ever watched.",8,0,2,5 April 2019
Green Book," Well-acted, well-directed, well-told, well done!
","I loved everything about this movie. Not the usual redemption story and not the common 'let's grow together' movie you may have warched before. Firstly and mostly, it's just a very well told story. No matter where do you come from, and what is your background, you can see this movie and enjoy 99.9% of it. Just with a notch of comedy when necessary, inherently charming acting of Viggo, fantastic acting of Maharshala, for which they both received the Oscar nomination, and Maharshala won it for the second time after Moonlight.
It's such an easy movie to watch, and such an easy one to love. Let alone the cinematography and the expected beautiful landscapes when driving in American roads.
I don't completely get the frustration of some film critiques, from not a very trained eye's perspective, it's a complete movie. And isn't what most movies should be about?Notice the details in the movie, most of which are perfected meticulously. The influence of both main characters on each other that comes from respect, or plain situational necessity, is remarkable. Both characters are vastly different from each other, and I'd assume from people like me. What keeps the audience's focus in tact is for sure the universal values they share. Both of them. Reminding us, no matter the difference in backgrounds, values can be the same and used as infrastructure of relationships, growth, and in some cases prosper.
I'm trying to stay out of spoils, but may I be excused to mention the farm scene? Reminding me once again, that what may lead to a certain race being/staying in a certain class of society.How prejudice can cause problems all around. It's not just one race towards another. I'm in a place in my life that I'd appreciate the globalization and interracial understandings and relations.All in all, I'd watch this movie again, I love the music in it from the very first scene. I love how the story is told in a soft way. I love how Mahaeshala and Bowers worked together to create all the Piano scenes, which to be honest, is so cool. I love how the amount of redemption in the movie is not that big to be interpreted as excessive or emotionally surprising, yet not that small to omit its significance. I just love that this movie has people who do good and the ones who do bad. To me it's just real!
How Dr. Shirley tries to impact the society with his music knowing the obstacles is another great interest of mine. I love a good struggle when I see it, and I loved this one.",10,1,4,26 March 2019
Donnie Darko," Ok... what?
","The only thing more annoying than the fake argument at the table and Immature acting of everyone including both Gylenhaals, is the sudden fade outs.
Bonus: 'Just sit next to the boy you think is the cutest'
Did the teacher just harassed a girl in the classroom? Super weird and inappropriate. The English teacher is easily the weirdest character I've seen in any movies. The basic plot is ok, and maybe well developed. But, any detail added has just made it excessive and very unnecessary. Darko's supposed to be very smart, this is done by making every single person around him incredibly dumb.
Horrible CGI, and if you think what to expect from a 2001 movie, watch the terminator 2! Not much to talk about this movie, really, just a badly told sad story. It feels like, an unexperienced self absorbed director has gotten access to a low amount of budget, and has spent it all on his mediocre actors' food. Disturbingly, this movie has no real point to make. 'You can't change one's destiny?'
This is not about anyone's attempt to try and change one's destiny at all.
The relationships in this movie are underdone, Barrymore's weird teaching, the sister's genius that's gotten her to Harvard . As far as the screenplay goes, it's messy.
Not to omit the presence of one Mr. Seth Rogen who was much younger back then.
School bullies, seemingly posh but in fact bad neighborhood, child crimes...
Maybe this is a good movie if you haven't really watched a lot of good ones or you're a teenager.
Or, maybe this is a good movie and I have missed it completely.",4,0,4,20 July 2019
The Godfather," Don Corleone
","It was a great movie. Don Corleone is a bad guy. every one is a bad guy here,they all do bad things,they all do crimes. But you can't escape from the fact that you love Don Corleone(Marlon Brando). The scene that he cries after his son(Sonny)died,made me cry. And I think that's what a movie is all about,You love the bad guys,because They're Good! I guess the Director some how skips the 'back together part' when Micheal and Kay get back together!Or Apolonia(Mike's first wife in the movie)'s death. I guess it was for shortening the movie,or maybe it just Doesn't matter. But Francis Ford Coppola could shorten another scenes. It was a great movie after all,maybe the greatest, I voted 9.",9,0,1,24 October 2012
