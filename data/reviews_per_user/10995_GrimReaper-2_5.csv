Casablanca," Greatest film ever
","This could possibly be the most perfect film I have ever seen.  'though I can't imagine how, I understand that not everyone will think as highly of it as I do, but I felt that everything came together so perfectly.What did it for me is the realization that, even though there are so many famous lines from this flick as to be cliche, not once did I feel like any of them were contrived (like perhaps some Arnold Schwarzenegger films may be wont to do) or out of place.I believed that Rick's Cafe Americain existed.  I believed Rick and Ilse and Victor were caught in a terrible love triangle.  I believed that Victor could understand and forgive his wife's transgressions, and I believed that, despite his protestations to the contrary, Rick Blaine was good at being noble.Goodness, how I loved this movie!",10,1,1,28 January 2002
X-Men," Pretty darn tasty ... but too short
","This movie was thoroughly enjoyable, if a bit too short.  Hugh Jackman was excellent as Wolverine, as everyone else has noticed, but I was most impressed with Sir Ian McKellen as Magneto.  LOTR fans who are anxious to see his portrayal of Gandalf must be encouraged.Elsewhere, I thought Marsden was channelling the spirit of Cary Elwes, which isn't necessarily a bad thing (e.g., The Princess Bride).  Dr. Jean Grey (I don't want to embarrass myself by misspelling Ms. Famke's last name) was fine, on many different levels, and I was impressed by Anna Paquin.  She is quite a young actress.Patrick Stewart was terrific, as always, and I think he and Sir Ian lent this film its gravitas.The script was efficient, and the director did a fine job of meshing the live action with the pretty good special effects.  Here's hoping that the next time, the studio green lights a bigger budget for a longer film and more eye-popping SFX.",9,0,0,24 July 2000
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A great tale of redemption
","I just finished watching this with my 6-year-old last night.  When I asked her what she thought of it, she said it was the story of how Darth Vader became good again.  I had never before realized just how right she was.  If one views the whole saga as the story arc of Anakin Skywalker, the title makes a lot more sense.  The pivotal moment of the series becomes when Darth Vader throws the Emperor down the shaft, as Anakin Skywalker redeems himself and returns (albeit posthumously) as a Jedi.  One of the few flaws I found in this film was the Ewoks, but even that can be excused when viewed against the story arc of Palpatine (the Emperor).  A terrific villain, we see how in the first two (presumably three) episodes how Palpatine is able to manipulate persons and events to his liking.  That the Ewoks provide the means of defeating his Empire shows how, in the words of another great saga, 'small hands do great works because they must.'  I can almost hear Master Yoda saying 'This is the hour of the Ewok-folk, when they arise from their quiet forests to shake the towers and counsels of the Wise.'The only other flaw I found was the chemistry between Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher from the Empire Strikes Back seemed to have been replaced with poor dialogue and too much a transformation of Han Solo into a wise-cracking boob.  I would have much preferred the confident air he projected in Episode V.",Null,0,0,4 June 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Brilliant acting and effects for one of the best books ever
","Going in to this film as a Tolkien purist, I had to force myself to view it as merely related to the book.  In that context, I thought the film was fantastic.  Sure, there was no Tom Bombadil, no Barrow-Downs, nor the Old Forest, but fortunately, there wasn't a XenArwen, either!I thought Peter Jackson did a wonderful job of bringing the scope and sense of 'epic' to Tolkien's brilliantly conceived yarn.  The effects were amazing (except for the corny, video-game feeling of Legolas on the Cave Troll scene) and the acting was spot-on.  In particular, Elijah Wood as Frodo and Sir Ian McKellen as Gandalf were terrific.One thing I appreciated as a Tolkien junkie, although it appears that the Balrog has wings, one who has come down on the other side of the fence could probably still argue that they do not.  I thought they were rendered as fairly insubstantial things, perhaps to make it slightly ambiguous.All in all, a masterful film from Peter Jackson -- better even, then Heavenly Creatures.",10,1,1,28 January 2002
Mulholland Drive," Pretty Cool, but Lynch can be too clever by half
","I've seen a lot of people praise this film as being an amazing deconstruction of (insert pet pop phenomenon here).  I've also seen a lot of people say it's the worst movie ever made.  I've seen the first group cluck their tongues and say, 'you people just don't get it.'It's too bad, really, that even in our wonderfully diverse society, people feel the need for superiority, to say to themselves, 'I know more than the great, unwashed masses.'  I find this kind of ... presumptuous arrogance distasteful.  If I talk to someone who says they hated it, I can say 'I can certainly see why.'  And if I talk to someone who says they think it's THE landmark achievement in cinema history, I say, 'I can certainly see why.' And that is what I appreciate about it.Lynch, I think, has made very clever, yet deeply personal film.  His vision may or may not be what the consensus of the intellegentsia is, but is, I think, likely to be different than what anyone else thinks.  I liken this movie to images seen in a prism; maybe what you're seeing is real; maybe it's fractured sunlight.  And because this filter has been put into place, Lynch forces the viewer to draw his/her own conclusions.  Want a logical conclusion?  You might not get one, and you are going to see the movie as a failure, but, as Homer Simpson might say, a spectacular one.  Want a film which blends noir and pathos?  Here it is.  Want a film with hot, lesbian sex?  Step right up.For me, I enjoyed it, but what I want from every film I see is a sense of meaning.  As a result, I felt that some loose ends untied resist a contrived meaning being forced upon them, and I 'felt' that Lynch had simply forgotten to tie them up, had tried to place too artificial a meaning on something, or (most likely) had not been given the chance to develop it further in the TV series.However, this movie fairly resonated with a sense of a deeper ... something, and I therefore found it enjoyable, but not quite perfect.  8 out of 10.",Null,0,1,24 May 2002
