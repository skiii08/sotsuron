Requiem for a Dream," This is not a cautionary tale by any means..
","Although I love this movie for its beauty in many forms, let's get one thing clear - it is more of a how-to than a don't-do. A kid who sees this movie will learn: If you get a phone call saying you're a winner, get a number to call back and verify. If you have a girlfriend, don't get her high unless you got plenty to spare. If you shoot up, don't do it in an infected arm. And above all, if you live in Brooklyn and need a fix, try Manhattan or one of the other boroughs - don't start driving down south!",Null,0,0,11 June 2001
The Others," A Ghost Story Different from The Others
","At first you may think you have seen this all before, and it can get to be a yawn if you are expecting a typical horror film. Treat this movie like a good book - one written by a Henry James, not a Stephen King.The performances are all wonderful. The children act like real children, and Nicole Kidman and Fionnula Flanagan force you to question their every move while still retaining your sympathies.A couple of plot points didn't seem to have a satisfactory resolution, but leaving them unaccounted for ultimately adds to the experience.The Others will leave you thinking - especially since the ending is really a beginning.",Null,0,0,25 August 2001
Moulin Rouge!," incredibly bad
","I was prepared to enjoy this movie, and I wound up hating it. None of the expensive fx, scenery, or interesting characters were given any screen time. There was nothing to take in and gasp at, as much as the director wanted you to go 'ooh' and 'ahh' - how could you when everything you want to see flies by with so many jumpcuts and camera angles that the only things you are left to see clearly are all the pores on the main characters' faces in interminably long, badly sung scenes? This was one long boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl again, boy gets girl again and how many more times is this going to go on and so on and so on in mind-numbing tedium.I started imagining, while watching this movie, how it would have been much better on a Broadway stage, replete with real singers, real dancers, real choreography and imaginative and beautiful set designs.. or even as a movie with a different director that would allow the viewer to be involved in more of the visual fantasy than just how much pancake makeup Nicole and Ewan were wearing.",Null,2,4,18 June 2001
Black Hawk Down," no politics please, this is a movie
","This is a movie, made for entertainment value, and that is all I care to review here. I enjoyed Black Hawk Down, but also was disappointed - for the same reason that the movie is fresh and atypical, it is also cold and uninvolving. In avoiding the usual archetypal-stereotypical characters always found in war movies,i.e., the valiant sargeant, the newbie lieutenant, the Bronx-Brooklyn-Joisey guy, the Okie from Muskogee, the maniac killer, the sensitive soul, etc. etc. ad nauseum, we wind up with ultimately faceless and nameless figures who congeal into an indistinguishable mass of helmets and guns.Despite the appearance of individual story-lines, I had trouble figuring out who I was watching after a while; there were characters introduced in the beginning who never seemed to appear again, and there were characters who did pop up whose fates seemed to be left hanging. By the end, I was wondering if I had even seen the character I thought I was watching in almost any given battle scene. The movie is very well done nonetheless, if all you want to see is a thrilling shoot-em-up. In that respect, Black Hawk Down is great entertainment. However, if you are looking for symbolic characterizations and political commentary, go rent a movie like Platoon.",2,2,7,10 June 2002
Am√©lie," cute and clever does not equal art
","I liked Amelie. I enjoyed Amelie. I would even say it's a perfect feel good movie - in a strange kind of vengeful way. Do I think it works? In a clever and cute way, yes. On a frantic, artistic, wow this is an epiphany wow this is teaching me something level, no. Why? It is just too clever and cute. Like I said, I enjoyed it, I even admired it, but understanding what all the fuss was about? Nope, I don't get it. I have seen plenty of tv shows and movies along Amelie's lines. I did enjoy watching it from a detached, sitcom without the usual built-in morality pov...so while Amelie may be France's latest answer to cinema nouveau, it was just too cute and clever and been there done that to convince an old jaded American...",Null,2,6,24 May 2002
