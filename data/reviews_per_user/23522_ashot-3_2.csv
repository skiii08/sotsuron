Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A strange mishmash of disconnected languages and events. At times funny - mostly tasteless
","I did not like the movie but have to admit that it so eclectically combines so many different things that pretty much the only remaining option for the viewer is to laugh.For example, of the two 'Kazakhs' who came to the US, one speaks predominantly Hebrew (when the 'Kazakhs' are alone) and English (with some strange fake Russian-Arabic accent), except for the word 'thank you', which is almost always said in Polish. The other 'Kazakh' speaks Armenian only (except for a couple of curse-words in Russian on just one occasion). Both of them, of course, do not look like Kazakhs at all. The inhabitants of the 'Kazakh' 'home village' speak Romanian. The majority of textual information is in Russian, some of which is heavily twisted.The reason I described the mishmash of languages in such detail is because all the views and situations in the movie are mixed in pretty much the same way as the languages.In short, this movie left an impression (on me, at least) of a donkey with a head of a lion, elephant ears, peacock tail and hummingbird brain who claims to be, say, George Bush.",3,36,72,17 November 2006
The Hurt Locker," How did this even get nominated for the Academy Awards?
","Movie - weak, plot - thin, characters - not believable, action - boring, actors' work - not interesting, director's work - not noticeable whatsoever.Besides propaganda, what is the point of this movie?Why would this movie win an Oscar? I'd like to see who voted for this so I could avoid movies voted for by the same people in the future.What is the message of the movie and how it tries to communicate that message? Friendship? There is none. Helping each other when hurt? It's war, that is what every war is about. Taking unnecessary risks and surviving 837 (or whatever the number was) times? If that is the case, does this guy know something we don't? Maybe (though I seriously doubt it, I studied that exact subject extensively while in military) -- but even if that is the case, the movie fails to articulate it.Unfortunately, overall -- waste of time.",2,20,28,8 April 2010
