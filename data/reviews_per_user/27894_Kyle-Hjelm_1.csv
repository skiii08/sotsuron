The Expendables 2," Definitely worth a watch if you enjoy action movies.
","First of all, this movie rocked. I went into this movie expecting to see explosions and to hear Bruce Campbell-esque one liners, and the movie did not disappoint. It opened with a bang and never let up.For the people who did not like this movie, I have one question... What were you expecting? The movie has Stallone, Willis, Arnold, Chuck, and JCVD... You have to know what kind of acting you're going to get.As long as you go into this movie for the right reason, I strongly believe that it will no disappoint you. The fight scenes were good, the explosions were great, but most of all seeing Rambo, The Terminator, and John McClain standing three feet away from each other shooting up the bad guys was AWESOME! Then you throw in some Chuck Norris-isms and some ballet martial arts from JCVD and you've got yourself one heck of an action movie. The only thing that could've made this movie better might have been a cameo by Steven Seagal.",9,2,8,18 August 2012
