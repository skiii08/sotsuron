Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Great Beginning to an Epic
","First off I must admit that I am a Star Wars fan and have been for years, but when I saw the Phantom Menace, the first fifteen or twenty minutes made me fear that all the critics were right and it wouldn't be that great, but as the film went on it became more and more apparent that the critics were wrong and this is a great beginning to a great movie series.  The pod race is outstanding (and very reminiscent of Ben Hur), the underwater city is great, the battle between the people of Jar Jar Binks and the Droids is immaculate, and the final show down between Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and the vicious Darth Maul is just outstanding.  All in all this movie is a worthy starting point to a great epic that makes me hungry for episodes II and III.  The critics just don't get it.",10,0,0,20 May 1999
Pi," Best indie of 1998
","Wow, this movie is such an interesting opus, the plot is intriguing, the cinematography is outstanding, the directing is flawless, and even the seemingly strange 'headache' scenes have so much to say.  In a time when most movies give you a cut and dried explanation of what is happening, it's nice to see a movie that is less than forthright and lends itself to interpretation.  If you don't want to be confused or surprised, this is not the movie for you, but if you are looking for something intelligent to ponder, give Pi a chance.",10,1,4,24 March 1999
