The Blair Witch Project," Pure, sheer terror that shackles the spirit from daring to look.
","What a concept. Instead of sitting there like the passive sponges most of us become when going to the movies we are actually expected be become involved. Take a leap of faith& belief and delve into this movie. With out the overpowering effects and music score most movies rely on to scare' you, if you still have an imagination left what is implied becomes a hundred times scarier than anything offered up by Hollywood in the last 30 years.Filmed on video and 16mm black & white, this film is exactly what the horror genre needs in a time reminiscent of the early 1980s slasher onslaught. The Blair Witch Project has no knife wielding maniacs, no deoxyribonucleic acid altered monsters, and no real bloodshed onscreen. We see what the three film makers see as they make their way through the deep, dank woods in search of a legendary witch. A guaranteed cult classic, Blair Witch has Heather, Mike, and Josh heading off into the allegedly hexed woods of Maryland looking for the Blair Witch or whatever else may exist up in those hills. For most of the film, it is very unclear. The beginning excerpts ingeniously set up the three participants to believe they are experiencing the supernatural, being played like a fiddle by the suspicious townspeople, or just completely out of their minds.If you are a seasoned veteran of the horror cinema, The Blair Witch Project may be less frightening than for someone who has not seen many scary movies. You will have to respect it's originality, and it's manipulation of our deepest fears. At times the film really makes you feel the sense of dread the film makers are experiencing.Many have complained about the shaky camera, the cussing, how no scenes really happen, and that it's not scary. By and large, the camera is not that shaky, at least to the point where you can't understand why they are tromping through the woods and they are scared half to death. I must not get queasy very easily, as I had no problem with it. As for the cussing the lines were improvised, the actors are college age, and all three sound exactly like every American college student.At a time when digital techniques can show us almost anything, 'The Blair Witch Project' is a reminder that what really scares us is the stuff we can't see. The noise in the dark is almost always scarier than what makes the noise in the dark. Any kid can tell you that. Not that he believes it at the time.",9,1,3,31 May 2020
Saturday Night Fever," 1970s style film vert dance club mixer
","An uneducated Brooklyn teen (John Travolta, in an Oscar-nominated role) lives in a dream world over the weekends as the king of a disco dance floor. Disillusioned, quietly upset with where his life is, Travolta finds solace by dancing in public to Bee Gee's music and finds love with his newest dance partner (Karen Lynn Gorney). The duo practice for an upcoming contest that could mean total success at last for Travolta and the opportunity to get discovered doing what he really loves. Travolta and his friends seem destined to go down a path of destruction though as a soap opera develops for all the key people found within. 'Saturday Night Fever' is a total over-achiever as it could have fallen to exploitation tactics of the 1970s, but becomes one of those iconic films that still stands the test of time.The film is made in film vert: grounded, edgy, & realistic. Camera lenses are used that the film's urban ambience & attitude. The script has infinitely indefinable coarse & cuss verbosity. There are some realistic & graphic rape & fight scenes. But its all to not stop the film's panacea Brooklyn flair m& atmosphere.While the movie is more apt to be recalled for its impact on American pop culture, few who watch the movie will ever see beyond the admittedly fantastic dance sequences. As a result, many people might never recognize Saturday Night Fever as perhaps one of the best movies ever made about class struggles among white ethnics.While Tony's friends idolize him, the movie never really does, but it does allow empathy for his plight, because even Tony realizes that he is virtually trapped by the current conditions of his existence. While much might be made of the homophobia, racism, and misogyny of the protagonist and his friends, these things are never excused and the movie goes to some lengths to express Tony's own recognition that these are shortcomings in not only his character, but those borne of a provincial mentality which he desperately longs to escape.We meet Tony's friends and the girls that hang around them, and we are reminded that feminism has not yet conquered Brooklyn. Some of the girls, especially a spunky little number named Annette (Donna Pescow), worship Tony. He dances with Annette because she's a good dancer, but he tries to keep her at arm's length otherwise. He's caught in a sexist vise: Because he likes her, he doesn't want to sleep with her, because then how could he respect her? The female world is divided, he explains, between nice girls and tramps. She accepts his reasoning and makes her choice.The Brooklyn we see in 'Saturday Night Fever'reminds us a lot of New York's Little Italy as Martin Scorsese saw it in 'Who's That Knocking at My Door?' and 'Mean Streets.' The characters are similar: They have few aims or ambitions and little hope of breaking out to the larger world of success -- a world symbolized for them by Manhattan, and the Brooklyn Bridge reaching out powerfully toward it.But 'Saturday Night Fever' isn't as serious as the Scorsese films. It does, after all, have almost wall-to-wall music in it (mostly by the Bee Gees, but including even 'Disco Duck'). And there are the funny scenes (like the one where Travolta shouts at his father: 'You hit my hair!') to balance the tragic and selJohn Travolta dedicates himself to his dancing and character, fitting the role with a graceful ease. The film goes into depth at studying characters too, it shows how desperate everyone is to fit in and be able to make an impressive image. The fantastic shots on character's feet show the 'strut' in their walk, representing their desire to maintain their reputation of being 'cool'. All the characters want to be something, while a lot of them will never add up to anything due to their working-class backgrounds. There are a fair amount of American social-comments scattered throughout the film and retaining a surprising amount of intelligent value.The gloriously groovy and funky soundtrack is possibly the film's finest element. The music accompanies the dance sequences with an amazing amount of memorably robust imagery. The use of The Bee Gees' music is wonderful to listen to and also for helping to create an ambiguous atmosphere of love, drugs and sex. The shooting techniques in the disco are magnificent for filming the dance scenes and fit perfectly alongside the other technical elements.Saturday Night Fever is a far more professional film than one might expect, it has intelligence as well as entertainment, which is something that makes a more than just admirable achievement. It is a truly remarkable triumph and a film that deserves more appreciation than it gets.",9,0,0,21 June 2020
Blade," Dark & edgy serial comic book propaganda; & it is cooked off its edge!
","Wesley Snipes is perfectly cast as Blade, a half human, half vampire known the day walker. He has all their strengths and his only weakness is the thirst for blood. Since he teamed up with Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) he has hunted down vampires who have lived amongst us unnoticed for centuries, but omnipotent overlord Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) is tired of living in harmony with the humans, as food, and he plans to waken the Blood God and take control of the worldDavid Goyer did a stroke of genius when he took the character of Blade and turned him into a leather clad dark knight. He can't take all the credit though and much of this must go to Stephen Norrington as well who with his distinct visual style brings out the best of the character. The Blade character is pretty amazing in this film and mixes martial arts with Batman like darkness. Snipes is pretty good as the title character and is successful in bringing out the duality and inner demons of the character. Stephen Dorff provides the best acting in the film and his chilling performance as Deacon Frost stands as one of the best screen villains. While overall bad comic book movies were so bad that they were entertaining, Blade is entertaining because the action is good. There are some typical action cliches but nothing too annoying for the viewer. The overall story is thin but again, nothing too bad.The story is good and renews the vampire genre by adding a lot of contemporary elements and maintaining the comic book feel. By saying that the film has a comic book feel does not mean that the film is unrealistic. Far from it. A lot of effort has been put in trying to make the film seem as real as possible. Including the effects which are pretty good for their time. The vampire 'dustings' are a very nice touch. In stead of adding a lot of blood when a vampire dies Norrington chose to let the vampires spontaneously combust which looks great. Vampire movies are usually considered to be low quality. For the most part, that is the case these days. But every now and then a good vampire movie comes up and in the 90's there were 3 vampire films that are considered to be the best.The film maintains it's dark edge with retrospective Gothic production, snappy one liners, & sudden violence. This may sound like cliches, but Stephen Norrington is able to direct the film through a Gothic style of its own. The screening time of 2 hours is not cumbersome. There are fresh surprises in every scene. The production design is tremendously visual & candy, with an intuitive & simplistic comic aspect to the production layering & screening.This movie pops right out of the pages onto the screen with sheer violence, blood, martial arts, weapons, fire, & the good against evil. Yes sure a lot of action flicks contain all these goodies, and most of them have bombed. But not Blade, the movie was filmed just right, not going overboard, delivering a good length and never a dull moment. Blade is a fantastic action thriller that keeps you captured for the whole duration and Wesley Snipes delivers what I would say to be his best performance yet.",8,0,0,31 May 2020
Troy," Stretched epic with some awe cinematography
","Loosely based on Homer's 'Iliad', Wolfgang Petersen directs this epic war film, with an ensemble cast including Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, Diane Kruger, Sean Bean, Brian Cox, Rose Byrne, Garrett Hedlund, Peter O' Toole, Brendan Gleeson, & Tyler Mane. Set in 1193 B.C., this movie tells the story of a war between the two cities of Troy and Sparta, and the story of one of the bravest warriors to roam ancient Greece named Achilles. King Agamemnon (Brian Cox) is ruler of Mycenea, but wishes to rule an empire, so his army slowly conquers the rest of what is now Greece. The only threat to his empire is a neighbouring country called Troy. Agamemnon's brother Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson) is tired of war, so he negotiate's peace with the Trojan princes Hector (Eric Bana) and Paris (Orlando Bloom). Upon leaving, Paris reveals to Hector that he has taken Menelaus's wife, Helen (Diane Kruger) with him, as he loves her. Menelaus goes to Agamemnom to start a war, and Agamemnom manages to convince legendary warrior Achilles (Brad Pitt) to fight among the Greek army. Hector and Paris arrive in Troy, and tell their father Priam (Peter O'Toole) of the upcoming war. Agamemnom arrives on the beaches of Troy with 1,000 ships, but after day 1, Achilles refuses to fight, and instead cares to Trojan prisoner Briseis (Rose Byrne). Over the next two battles Hector kills Menelaus, Ajax (who is the Greek's best warrior after Achilles), and Achilles's cousin, Patroclus, and finally Achilles decides to don his armour and face Hector in a duel to the death.Brad Pitt delivers one of the best performances of his career as Achilles, giving the right amount of power and strength. I couldn't care less about Pitt until seeing this movie as he does an outstanding job portraying Greece's greatest warrior. No, he's not the bulkiest warrior to ever grace the earth, but he's fast as lightning, confident, expertly skilled and deadly accurate. Even his voice completely fits the role. I have been a longtime critic of Brad Pitt as a second tier talent who became famous only because of his looks, but in this film he surprised me. He is the true star of the film. Achilles is easily the most interesting and entertaining character. I applaud Brad Pitt's effort in making his character a tragic hero. Achilles acknowledges that he is not the son of a goddess and is not immortal or invulnerable. The movie basically shows us how a rumor can blossom into a legend unto itself. Achilles' legend becomes immortal. He even refers to this in my favorite scene when he is inspiring his men and starts the invasion heavily outnumbered and still triumphs. Later in the same scene he scoffs at the so called gods the Greeks and Trojans worship by decapitating the statue. I found this scene symbolic of the movie itself. The gods are nothing to both the characters and audienceEric Bana is also terrific as Prince Hector, trying to negotiate peace between Troy and Sparta. Besides the supporting cast, Peter O' Toole is just perfect playing the king of Troy.As for beautiful women, there are only a couple mention able: Diane Kruger plays Helen, 'the face that launched a thousand ships.' Some have complained that she's too plain for the role, but I disagree. I'm not a fan of hers or anything, but she looks pretty dang sharp to me (not to mention has an impressive behind shot). Besides, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. If Paris deems her worthy of starting a war, who are we to disagree? Also on hand is cutie Rose Byrne who plays Briseis, the virgin priestess whom Achilles converts to the pleasures of the flesh.This movie contains some of the most elaborate action sequences that I've ever seen on film. The costumes and the art direction all stay true to the ancient Greece setting, and they all create a realistic feel to the movie. This movie is perfectly well-made, from the distinguished art, to the intense battle sequences.Wolfgang Petersen's film benefited from the effect 'Gladiator' and offered the possibility of expanding commercial horizons towards a movie that achieved a big commercial success . The hand of the director carries out an interesting story as well as thrilling and unsweetened , reasoning the causes and motivations of their roles , taking their time and giving large doses of artistic genius . If you are accustomed to battles as Braveheart or Gladiator, you will enjoy with 'Troy' , a great epic that shows the limits of the legend , which allowed Petersen to take some particular elements based on the 'Illiad' of Homer . The battles are breathtaking, thousands of people took part though mostly were staged by means of computer generator . The tale is pretty violent , the struggles are very bloody and savage , in fact , Brad Pitt and Eric Bana did not use stunt doubles for their epic duel . The main cast is formed by big names who give acceptable acting .The script was written with a mind to keep the important details of the original story intact but to make it as realistic as possible. The gods are there but only in spirit. They don't get directly involved in the action like the original. I think this is a good thing as well. Troy looks like historical recreation rather than a literal translation of the poem. In one scene I thought there was an unlikely event and researched only to find it actually is in the Iliad. When the writer was asking for too much, he was in fact being true to the text. My bad.
I haven't seen that much gladiator movies in my time, but I can safely say that 'Troy' is one of the most remarkable and action-packed motion pictures that audiences will never forget. 'Troy', in my review, 'action-packed, beautifully well-made'.",9,0,0,20 June 2020
The Bourne Identity," A good state to the classic meat & butter espionage thriller
","The crew of a fishing vessel find a body floating in the middle of the ocean. They bring it on board and the improvised 'doctor' finds two bullets on the back and a Swiss bank account implanted in the hip of the body. The 'body' indeed is not dead but unconscious: he is Jason Bourne (Matt Dammon), a CIA secret and very well prepared agent with amnesia. During the period of fishing in the sea, he recovers his health. Once on shore, he decides to go to the Swiss bank and then to the American Consulate. There he meets Marie Helena Kreutz (Franka Potente, from 'Run Lola Run' and 'Anatomy') and they two together will pass to the most spectacular actions along the film. The great Matt Dammon and Franka Potente are perfect.I Bourne is trained. Is he ever. He speaks several languages, is a formidable martial artist, has highly trained powers of observation and memory, knows all the spy tricks and is a formidable driver. We see that during a sensational chase scene through the streets of Paris, much of it through narrow alleys, down flights of steps, and against trafficWhile 'Bourne' does not have a particularly deep plot, it is consistent and focused. The focus is entirely upon Bourne and how he is to deal with having no memory of his past, being hunted without knowing why. Some people have complained about being confused by the movie. I for one, do not need to have everything spelled out since in many cases this smacks of unreality in the first place; the essence of espionage is drawing conclusions from very sketchy information.Douglas Liman, the film's executive producer, directs it. He directs the traffic well, gets a nice wintry look from his locations, absorbs us with the movie's spy craft and uses Damon's ability to be focused and sincere. His direction seems to slow down the piously choreographed chase scenes & martial fights to focus on heavy exposition between Damon & Potente's characters as they unveil they myriad of mysteries regarding Bourne's fishing out of Mediterranean waters & his very identity; before expert action film director Paul Green Grass took over in the second film & speed the film up with his shaky hand held camera & fast editing & mixing style. Liman does not playing out the film as a stage play in which we are acquainted with the characters' mystery & conspiracy strung ids & limited superegos.The fights are just impressive, which, as other reviewers have pointed out, are among the most believable martial arts based fight scenes ever seen. No big grand gestures or Olympian kicks just fast, nasty moves designed to inflict maximum damage with minimum effort.This movie is better than the sequels in the Bourne series due to the romantic interest between Jason and Marie and the humanity expressed in the script versus the action in the sequels. The script has some special lines, such as Jason's 'Just keep on talking, it's relaxing,' and 'How do I know that?' and Marie's 'I said I was your personal assistant, I just asked for it' and 'Nobody does the right thing,' and the dying agent's line 'We always work alone.' The story raises issues about organizations which tend to eliminate their own members. In the end, truth and justice win out on an individual level, if not a societal level which, it seems, was the author's message.Nonetheless, a great opener to a trilogy that Green Grass would enhance by letting the script dissolve in the film with the pace & mood of a classic, nearly Hitchcock, espionage thriller. The entire story is a set up for the martial arts and chases. Because they are done well, because the movie is well crafted and acted, we give it a pass. The Bourne Identity is excellently paced and brings a great deal of realism to the spy genre. The fight sequences are fast and believable, the car chases are accurately choreographed and the character of Jason Bourne is vulnerable and easy to identify with.",9,0,0,6 June 2020
Spider-Man," Comically cool introduction to the Spider Man legend.
","The appeal of the best sequences in the Superman and Batman movies is that they lend weight and importance to comic-book images. Within the ground rules set by each movie, they even have plausibility. As a reader of the Spider Man comics, I admired the vertiginous frames showing Spider Man dangling from terrifying heights. He had the powers of a spider and the instincts of a human being.Spider-Man takes most of its cues from 1978's Superman: The Movie. Peter Parker's journey from unassuming geek to high-flying hero mimics the Man of Steel's in story and tone. The colorful comic spirit of Richard Donner's gleefully exciting original is all here, just Marvel fiend. Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp approach Spider-Man's origin with reverence for Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's original story. Koepp's script hits all the beats you'd expect (Spider bite, wrestling match, great power, and all that), but it also includes, unexpectedly, an intelligent, eloquent emotional foundation. Raimi and Koepp understand who Peter Parker is, and how his transformation into Spider-Man can metaphorically parallel his development as a character. In being confronted by new and strange spider powers, Peter is also confronted by the responsibilities of manhood. Koepp takes Stan Lee's best idea (That Peter Parker should grapple equally between super villains and everyday problems), and pushes it to its logical max.Peter's infatuation with girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is given equal importance to his struggle with Norman Osborne's manic alter ego, the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). The result is pretty well timeless. The quintessential Spider-Man story. A coming of age tale that gracefully weaves together every important aspect of the wall-crawler's myth into a grand concoction of pure Spider-Man.Enhancing the story is one of the great casting jobs in motion picture history. First and foremost is Tobey Maguire, who was a revelation as Peter Parker/ Spider-Man. Like Christopher Reeve before him, Maguire completely defines the role. His Parker is a good kid; shy, dorky, and believably square. He radiates with innocence and later, teenage anxiety. As Spider-Man, he's delightfully charismatic. Lively, but never annoyingly brash in the way other Spideys have been. In the costume or not, every subsequent Spidey will live in his shadow. Maguire's casting was a stroke of genius, but it was no anomaly. Kirsten Dunst is a luminous Mary Jane, and she and Peter's romance sparkles with charm. Willem Dafoe relishes his Green Goblin role, with a voice and presence that burn with comic book intensity. Peter Parker was crucial in the evolution of Marvel comics because he was fallible and had recognizable human traits. He was a nerd, a loner, socially inept, insecure, a poor kid being raised by relatives. Ma Guire gets all of that just right, and I enjoyed the way Durnst is able to modulate her gradually increasing interest in this loser who begins to seem attractive to her.I also liked the complexity of the villain, who in his Dr. Jekyll manifestation is brilliant tycoon Norman Osborn and in his Mr. Hyde persona is a cackling psychopath. Osborn's son Harry is a rich kid, embarrassed by his dad's wealth, who is Peter's best and only friend, and Norman is affectionate toward Peter even while their alter egos are deadly enemies. That works, and there's an effective scene where Osborn has a conversation with his invisible dark side. The origin story is well told, and the characters will not disappoint anyone who values the original comic books.But Spider-Man belongs to Sam Raimi. A Spider-Man super fan since childhood, Raimi was destined to bring the web slinger to life. The offbeat sense of violent fun and jubilant cinematic showmanship that made Evil Dead and Darkman so entertaining is precisely what was needed to bring Spider-Man's New York to dazzling light. And what a creation Raimi's Spider-Verse is! The tone, with a precarious balance of larger-than-life action and textured character moments, never wavers once. Raimi crafts in Spider-Man, a New York where the archetypal comic book mainstays: the cackling villains, the wise-cracking heroes, and the pedestrians who shout to the skies 'Look, it's Spider-Man!', fit just as well as the richly drawn human characters. Raimi and the creative team behind the film's production design deserve the highest of praises. There is nothing else that combines style and realism to such astonishing effect. It's as if forty years of comics have been distilled into a real world somewhere alongside our own.Spider-Man showcases Sam Raimi at his exuberant best. Every frame of this movie is bursting with life. Whether it's the often gripping action scenes or the carefully crafted soap operatic drama, Spider-Man is an enthusiastic piece of crowd-pleasing entertainment, a passionate celebration of the Spider-Man Myth, and above all, a work of unparalleled quality. Blockbusters, especially superhero movies, with their all but guaranteed profits, can often breed lazy film making. Sam Raimi and company fly in the face of that conceit. The filmmakers have taken the time to really craft this film. Wrapped up in all the soaring spectacle is something real; An enchanting love story, a poignant morality tale about becoming the man you will be for the rest of your life.That movie starts the string of the spider man that I'm grown with and raise the bar really high for the next super hero movie which comes soon after it. This part is really good synthesized. I can tell much more good thing about the movie but you can make them on your own.",9,0,1,13 June 2020
The Transporter," Flash & Panache wheel in this basic action film.
","Jason stars as Frank Martin. He's a hired gin who does driving jobs for a hefty fee. For his services he'll use his superb driving skills to get his paying customers out of a jam. He asks no questions and needs precise instruction in order to perfectly time his getaways.As the lead character, Statham's a transporter. He can get you, your associates or your property anywhere, anytime, on time, no questions asked. But you know what? Common sense tells us that it was curiosity that killed the cat, and the cat in this picture thankfully doesn't die some horrible death but instead, curiosity yields him a break - a beautiful woman named Lai (Shu Qi) - bound and gagged, and in the trunk of his BMW. The day he breaks his own rules, he realizes he is transporting a Chinese girl, Lai (Qi Shu), and he gets in many troubles due to his fault.It starts with a wild car chase in France, & introduces some memorable phrases. There are no smarmy one-liners making light of good action sequences as is too often the case in American-directed action flicks. There are some unbelievable yet jaw-dropping stunts, a terrific fight scene in oil, and some great car chase scenes. The Statham is cold, yet compassionate. There is even a great shot of the him jumping off a speeding semi while it races over a bridge onto the back of a bus going perpendicular to the truck under the bridge!! I mean, come on! There is another hilarious scene where the hero chases down an airplane on foot, hijacks it, jumps out of the plane at great altitude in order to land on the back of a speeding transport with a conveniently located borrowed parachute!There is plenty of action, Statham does display some pretty impressive moves but the frantic editing just doesn't do him justice. He obviously worked out for this part and there are frequent moments when his ripped torso is on display. He also (barely) manages to shy away any possible accusations that he's just a British novelty to American audiences.A basic action film filled with bone breaking action and wild stunts. People have unfairly slammed this movie for being unrealistic. What do you expect? The action scenes are performed to panache & stylized you have to suspend belief. There are many great action sequences, some so unbelievable you have to just shake your head and remember that action movies are not supposed to be based on reality. Over all, a fun action film filled with bone breaking action and wild stunts.",8,0,0,31 May 2020
The Matrix Reloaded," Even more exciting than the first, with revamped action & effects.
","Neo, Morpheus, Trinity, and the rest of their crew continue to battle the machines that have enslaved the human race in the Matrix. Now, more humans are waking up out of the matrix and attempting to live in the real world. As their numbers grow, the battle moves to Zion, the last real-world city and center of human resistance.It is a good sequel who doesn't deserve to be hated for it. Keanu Reeves and all other cast crew did outstanding performance on their works. Nearly 12 years later have passed since no movie has come close to tapping into the myth, world and action that was created in Matrix Reloaded. For fans of action movies, the story can be as straight forward as you wish it to be, following the path of Neo as man kind's savior. For those who wish to dive deeper, you can see how far the rabbit whole really goes because the amount of hidden references, back plots and information in this movie is immense. For a film The Matrix fans this wouldn't be an action movie without some action. There's plenty of it, and it's perfectly done. The computer generated image effects creating more Smiths are astonish, were cutting edge for the time, and still look great (whoever said differently below is simply incorrect) -- even if they're completely commonplace today. Insane action ensues as a well done plot follows.For as far as the action sequences are concerned: Groundbreaking. You'll see stuff that you've never seen before. Sometimes the scenes are a little lengthy, which harms the narrative, but that is compensated easily by the visual spectacle. And yes, the Architect at the end is difficult to understand, but when you watch the film more than once, you'll find out that it does make sense what he says. All together this movie may not be as fantastic as 'The Matrix', but it is definitely a good movie that will keep you thinking for a while.
Were the film separated itself from other action packed films is of course in the underlying philosophical and religious aspects. Once the film has been watched a few times for the effects you can begin to see some of the elements. I don't think its possible to fully translate and analyze every element of the film. Mainly because every element can be analyzed in a bunch of different ways. Without spoiling too much I can say that if you look hard enough you will be able to find Plato, Baudrillard, Gnosticism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Christian elements and some more. The people who tell matrix lovers to get a life for searching the Matrix for a deeper meaning ought to open their eyes and watch the film one more time. With that I'm not saying that you can't be intelligent if you don't like the Matrix I am simply asking you to give it another chance. You really won't regret it.Effect wise Reloaded is a feast. There is literally something to look at in every scene. The 'real' world has been given a face lift to make it more interesting. The real effects, however, take place inside the matrix and just like in the first film the effects are absolutely ground breaking. Rivaling the likes of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings and that is saying something. The people who think the story is pretentious and the dialog stubby will undoubtedly get their adrenaline fix in the action scenes. Some scenes had me holding my breath and gasping at how beautiful and overwhelming it all was and as much as I love the philosophical aspects of the film I can watch it for the effects themselves as well. Without spoiling anything I can say that lovers of cool fight scenes and effects are in for a hell of a treat with this one. For as far as the action sequences are concerned: Groundbreaking. You'll see stuff that you've never seen before. Sometimes the scenes are a little lengthy, which harms the narrative, but that is compensated easily by the visual spectacle. And yes, the Architect at the end is difficult to understand, but when you watch the film more than once, you'll find out that it does make sense what he says.It is obvious that this sequel to The Matrix takes the story to a whole new dimension. Different characters define the working of the matrix, and the meaning of life itself, in different ways, depending on their ontological background. A conclusion is not given, which adds to the movie a kind of postmodern quality. All together this movie may not be as fantastic as 'The Matrix', but it is definitely a good movie that will keep you thinking for a while.",9,0,0,13 June 2020
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Paced, effect comedy with a twist.
","Ferrell plays Ron Burgundy, a sensationally arrogant and dumb San Diego news anchor. His goofy co-stars (including Paul Rudd & the scarily dim Steve Carrell) are also his only friends until Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) arrives to spike their testosterone punch. Soon she's sharing Burgundy's desk and his bed. But the men resent this woman (the first female anchor ever, apparently) and humorous trouble brews. Fred Willard plays the boss and straight man, which is a bit of a disappointment. He's too hilarious to be so serious. Anchorman tells a simple story: acclaimed (and consequently arrogant) news anchor Ron Burgundy is forced to adapt when an attractive new female member of the Channel 4 news team (Applegate) begins changing the way he and his quirky news team work. That's it. This story is predictable, prescription esquire, boring. But Anchorman does not draw it's strength from story. It draws from the hilarious situations. It draws from randomness. It draws from brief but memorable cameos. It draws from those 100 or so unforgettable one liners.As apposed to many, many, other comedies, Anchorman actually gets better as it moves along. Most of the time a comedy like this will use up all the laughs in the first hour and then try to take a serious, lovey dovey turn in the last act. There are more laughs in the last half hour than in the first half hour, which usually is never the case. It's as if there was some mathematical comedic formula that spread the laughs out in a way that it was consistently funny. Or, maybe they just got lucky. I do not know.I loved all the characters in the movie, every role no matter how small had a great moment or two. Will Ferrel of course, the star of the movie who is just perfect as Ron. He's so so funny cause he's such a lovable idiot. Even Christina Applegate, who was in a role that quite honestly anyone could have done, is able to make it her own and provide some laughs. There is a scene that has a lot of cameos that was hilarious as well. It was one of those moments that takes you completely by surprise.'Anchorman' is completely over the top, and ignores any boundaries. That really makes it work. 'Anchorman' is broad stroke farce done well. Will Ferrell demonstrates great comedic gifts. I want to see what he creates next. For now, 'Anchorman' is just great fun, and very funny stuff.",7,0,0,13 June 2020
The Bourne Supremacy," Green Grass hurtles you through this paced up sequel.
","Paul Green Grass steps in the director's chair, with his quintessentially action film octane buff & thrilling direction style. The film picks up a style of its own. It would replicate this in the third installment the Bourne Ultimatum. It chiefly involves shaky camera, close camera angles, & fast choppy editing in perfect synchronicity with the series' awe sound.The casting is still great, with Matt Damon bringing a dead pan portrayal to the Bourne character. Hes very good in this role, which commits a great success to the whole of the movie. Supporting players Brian Cox and Julia Styles, along with newcomer Joan Allen, all provide stellar support for Bourne. The action is intense and really well done, and the plot is thrilling and will surprise you quite a bit.The movie is assembled from standard thriller ingredients, and hurtles from one action sequence to another in India and Europe, with cuts to parallel action in Washington and New York. What distinguishes it is Bourne's inventiveness. There's a scene where he takes about four seconds to disable an armed agent and steal his cell phone contact list, and you're thinking, this is a guy who knows what he's doing. And how about the innovative use he finds for a toaster? It's neat to see him read a situation and instantaneously improvise a response, often by using lateral thinking.The camera work is extremely fast paced, and overall it has a gritty, captivating style. The camera is unstable. It was obviously done intentionally by design choice, but not excessively overdone. Through action scenes that had you at the edge of your seat, you'd just come to realize that you can see what the heck is going on. This makes these scenes easy to enjoy. But not only was it the action scenes; even during quiet still scenes the camera would always seem to be moving. Just to serve as a warning, it's pretty much like that throughout most of the movie, so brace yourself for an adventure of epic proportions.We have a pretty good idea, long before anyone else does, because the movie observes the Law of Economy of Character Development, which teaches us that when an important actor is used in an apparently subordinate role, he's the villain. But the movie doesn't depend on its big revelations for its impact; the mystery is not why Bourne is targeted, but whether he will die. He survives one lethal trap or ambush after another, leaping off bridges, crashing cars, killing assailants, and finally limping a little after a chase that should have killed him.Because it's plot heavy, The Bourne Supremacy requires the viewer to watch, and the large amount of talking goes some way to distancing this from most other action movies. However, this could also be seen as a good point as it can not, at times, hinder the movie in the excitement stakes and make it easy viewing for those that do like their action. The movie spans across Europe to a number of different countries including Germany, Britain, France and Russia and this keeps it exciting as it allows the landscape of the movie to change constantly and the film doesn't dwell in the same area. In fact, the film is very efficient on the whole and it never overindulges in anything, which compensates for the amount of talking and allows it to be exciting. Despite it being more stealthy than most, time is still found for a number of high-octane sequences including fist fights, explosions and the great car chase that looks as if it could have been lifted straight out of Grand Theft Auto.With all of these elements together, you got one great action thriller that in many cases even surpasses Identity! Movies like this are hard to come by, in todays times with many action pictures that just don't work and become tedious. Definitely see The Bourne Identity before this don't fret: you will be very entertained.",8,0,0,6 June 2020
