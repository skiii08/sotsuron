The Blair Witch Project," A revolution in horror films.
","This movie was not only gripping, it was also breath taking.  I caught myself on a number of occasions holding my breath, and trying not to make a sound so that I could hear what was haunting (what felt like) me.  It's a complete revolution in the horror film.  I say this because people in general have become de-sensitized to gore, blood, guts, violence, etc.  The Witch of this movie, her looks, her secrets, were left to the depth of the imagination, which is, a lot of times, more effective than actually seeing what it is we are fearing.  No one knows how deep and fascinating, and truly horrifying our imagination can be, until one sees this movie.  The depth of our imagination is unknown, and what is more scary than something we don't know?",Null,1,1,26 July 1999
