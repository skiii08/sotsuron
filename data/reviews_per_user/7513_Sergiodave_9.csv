The Lobster," Insane but unmissable I think
","Set in a dystopian world in what feels like a 1960's/70's setting The Lobster is a unique movie about love. Described on IMDb as a comedy, It might be one of the blackest comedies I've seen, or alternatively, it is an idea of a bleak past/future. It is shot in a very stark and minimalist way, reminiscent of Fahrenheit 451, so the quality of the acting is essential, ergo, this is not a Hollywood production! Colin Farrell shows a surprising acting ability, by being a nobody, an uninteresting guy you wouldn't take a second glance at. Rachel Weisz as the female lead is her usual brilliant self (she is also the narrator of the tale) and Olivia Coleman as the Hotel Manageress is fantastic. I can't say you will love it but it definitely will be memorable. I enjoyed it ,I think!",7,0,2,1 January 2017
Blade Runner 2049," Superb
","I went into the theatre with apprehension, knowing I loved the original, hoping that Denis Villeneuve wouldn't screw it up. The director's track record so far was pretty great so I was very hopeful that he could pull off the impossible(or so it felt). The direction is great, the cinematography is deserving of all awards going, musical score follows on wonderfully from the original. Ryan Gosling is fine in the lead role, although in my view, any decent actor could have played the part. The movie is more about concepts than action sequences, reminiscent of '2001 A Space Odyssey'. I can honestly say I am delighted with this sequel. Can only give 9/10, as I don't believe in perfection.",8,1,5,22 October 2017
Passengers," Very enjoyable Sci-fi
","Watch any trailer and you normally get the main points of a movie. Not this one, It caught me of guard, in a good way. Chris Pratt as the lead actor impressed me, his acting was far better than I've seen before, and points to a promising future. Jennifer Lawrence was good, but nothing special, though her part didn't require it!. The only other two actors were Michael Sheen, who played an android and Lawrence Fishburne, who in my mind was a nod to 'Event Horizon'. The Cinematography was excellent, and the direction was OK. It is hard to describe the movie without giving away the plot, but suffice to say I had a surprisingly good 2 hours in the Cinema. Good movie to watch, but not groundbreaking!",6,0,2,26 February 2017
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Not that funny
","Will Ferrell movies are normally love or hate. I found this one lacking, but not terrible. The acting is okay and the jokes are very cliched, which is the point, but the problem is Will Ferrell is just being him, and without a great comedy partner, he's like Garfunkel without Simon, or Sonny without Cher.. He, by himself is not enough to make you laugh, he needs a good partner.",4,13,28,1 July 2020
Ready Player One," Far higher than my expectations
","This movie really surprised me. Thought it might be bit young for me, I'm 46, but no , not only did I find it fun and engaging, but I loved all the references to iconic games, movies and songs of the 80's. Very well made movies that will appeal to people of all ages, yet another win for Spielberg.",8,2,2,15 May 2020
K-19: The Widowmaker," Surprisingly good
","Watched it on Netflix late at night, not expecting that much, only heard okay reviews, but found I really liked it. Good acting, lots of suspense, not sure where it's leading. Definitely give this one a go, I really liked it.",7,0,0,12 May 2020
Ex Machina," Superb Sci fi movie
","Ex Machina is without doubt the best movie to date dealing with the possibilities and problems of artificial intelligence. In his directorial debut, Alex Garland has made a Sci-fi masterpiece. Domhnall Gleeson plays a young computer programmer tasked with testing the intellect of Ava, an A.I robot (played by Alicia Vikander) through a series of discussions. There are only 3 main cast members, Domhnall Gleeson and Oscar Isaac who are both very good, and Alicia Vikander, who I think deserved an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Ava, somehow conveying warmth without showing emotion. An intelligent thought provoking film that I would recommend to anyone.",8,0,2,22 September 2016
La La Land," A very pleasant surprise
","There has been a lot of hype about La La Land. A modern take on the old style Hollywood musical, dancing, singing and romance with everybody living happily ever after. This kind of movie doesn't normally float my boat, but Damien Chazelle, the director, made the brilliant 2014 hit 'Whiplash', so I thought I'd give it a try. I had a smile on my face through most of the movie, the songs, while not greatly memorable fit the scenes well. I'm more Fred Ward than Astaire, so my knowledge of choreography is zip, but the dancing seemed fine to me. There is a good chemistry between the lead actors, played by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling and I think the cinematography is superb, the use of colour is fantastic. Overall, not being a lover of musicals, I was very surprised by how much I liked it. A solid 7/10.",7,1,3,19 January 2017
Spectre," Very good, but flawed.
","The latest James Bond movie is extremely good, with brilliant effects and a good script, but not up to the standards of Casino Royale. They always say you love the Bond you grew up with, and for me that should be Roger Moore, but Daniel Craig to my mind is by far the best Bond. I hope he will star in at least 1 more. As for the rest of the franchise cast, Ben Wishaw as Q is superb, with some of the best lines, Naomi Harris is great as Miss Moneypenny and Ralph Fiennes is my favourite M. The Bond girls in the movie are Lea Seydoux and Monica Berlucci. The on screen chemistry between Daniel and Lea was only slightly better than that of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in 'Eyes wide shut', and the problem with Monica was that it was far too fleeting an appearance. Dave Bautista was fine and menacing as Mr Hinx, but Christoph Waltz was severely underused. Overall very good, but not in my top 5 Bond movies.",6,1,8,11 November 2015
