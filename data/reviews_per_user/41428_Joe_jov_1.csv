The Avengers," Fun to watch
","Been waiting for this movie for weeks. Finally, on 4th may '12 the movie is released. Waited for 4 hours to get the premiere tickets. Worth the wait? No. But the satisfaction to be able to watch it on the first day? Priceless! Anyway, here's what i think of the avengers, I cant say that i love it, but i don't hate it. I just expected a little more out of it. There is not much action in the beginning of the movies. Although, the story line flow naturally & builds up later on. You don't have to watch iron man, captain America or thor to enjoy the movie. I rated it 8 because here & there i get a pretty good laugh, mostly giggle. And, of course, high points for the excellent movie effects. In conclusion, Its a fun to watch movie, & definitely will lighten the mood. One of the must see 2012 watchlist. *If you have the time, stick through the end of the credits, & check out the next enemy of the avengers. *",7,1,4,4 May 2012
