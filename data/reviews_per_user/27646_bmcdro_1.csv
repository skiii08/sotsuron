3:10 to Yuma," Great movie except for the last 10 minutes
","Very good and enjoyable movie, the actors all play very well their parts, and everything is very smooth up to a point, when everything just does not make sense anymore. I do not understand how the scriptwriter could do such a thing to this movie. It was all going so well, it could have been such a good movie so easily. And then, it happens. One of those things that makes you say - well this in not believable, no real person would do such a thing, because not only is stupid ( stupid people we've seen very often ) , but it is also so little credible to have ever happened, that they might as well make a pig fly in the movie and not explain why it flew. Very silly ending, it made a mess of otherwise a remarkable movie. The movie is a 9 stars out of 10 except for the last 10 minutes that are 2 out 10. This is why I only rated it 6 out of 10. Because the ending is a BIG part of the movie. Stop disappointing people with stupid silly endings !",6,4,8,28 October 2007
