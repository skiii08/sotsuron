Changeling," Another Notch on Eastwood's Gun!
","All I knew about this movie going in was that it involved a missing kid and when he's returned the mother insists that he is not her son. I wan't sure what genre the film was; science fiction/fantasy/supernatural, action/adventure or drama. Turns out it was drama, as it relates a true story, albeit a period piece taking place in the 1920s & 30s. I'd forgotten it was directed by Clint Eastwood and his films are so eclectic they're difficult to categorize. This is one of his best films by far. It is a fascinating, exciting and frustrating journey that takes twists and turns. Last and certainly not least is the star, Angelina Jolie who leads us on this journey. If there was any doubt that she is a great actress, this film will verify that as fact. She never seems the same in any of her performances and she has a knack for becoming the 'character', never so much as here. This film illustrates her range of emotions deftly played. Thanks to her and Eastwood, this was a gut-wrenching journey reminiscent of 'The Shawshank Redemption'. You can't wait for justice to prevail. Well done Angelina & Clint.",9,4,6,24 August 2009
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Fabulous and as good as the other three!
","I can't disagree more with those who knock this film. First off, it is only part of the trilogy and is not yet complete...but I'd say off to a great start! Judging a story by it's first third is not correct. I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of Phantom Menace. Why? Because like many Star Wars fans my expectations weren't so high that nothing could meet them. The effects in this movie were incredible. The worlds created: Tatooine's other cities, Naboo's large city, underwater city and Coruscant were eye popping wonders...worlds I've never been to before. The acting was fine...no Star Wars film is ever going to match Shakespearean productions (thank God for that!). The story moved along fast with expert pacing. It was not boring by any stretch of the imagination and those who say it was would be bored on a trip to the moon! What were people expecting? I felt George Lucas delivered and I know when the next two are finished we'll all agree that the man is a genius! Quit being so hard on this film and enjoy it. It's better than most films of the 1990s and of the 21st century so far. And remember this, most of you who complain about this film were kids when you saw the others. Think about it!",10,18,28,17 October 2001
The Notebook," One of the Best Love Stories Ever!
","This film is so brilliant in every aspect and ranks at the Top of any list of great love story movies. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are superb in the role of two star-crossed lovers who experience all the joys and heartbreaks of unconditional love as do James Garner and Gena Rowlands as lovers in their twilight years. The rest of the cast is also top notch including Joan Allen, as a controlling, but penitent mother and Sam Shepard as a down-to-earth, caring father. The story is simple but it rings so true that it moves one's heart and tear ducts. The cinematography is stunning, the direction well-paced, the music score not to sugary, bland or predictable, but just right to add to the perfection of this film. All the chemistry is there on the screen and it just draws you in to the story almost immediately. Normally, I prefer unconventional love stories like 'Marty' or 'The African Queen', but this one strikes a perfect chord for me and I highly recommend it.",10,1,2,19 May 2010
Troy," A Magnificent Spectacle!
","How anyone can call this film boring is beyond me. I question their sanity. How can you call a film based on a poem or two, a myth, inaccurate? Isn't a myth something blown way out of proportion? Which story/film of Robin Hood is accurate? Or King Arthur? Rasputin? A lot of talent, hard work, and yes research, was put into this film and it shows on the screen. The director's cut adds even more detail and character development to this excellent film. The cinematography is stunning, the art direction, sets, props, costuming and makeup effects dazzle the viewer and the music score adds emotion to the proceedings. I especially liked the idea of building the Trojan Horse out of destroyed ship parts. It actually makes sense; where else would they find the materials. The director's cut shows more of the carnage than the theatrical print and not gratuitously, but to depict the ugliness of war. Other details included the preparations in Troy for oncoming war, the care of the wounded, the burial of the dead and the unusual style of fighting using leaps, dives and backhanded sword slashing of the greatest warrior, Achilles. The direction is well paced, the dialog perfection, the acting by the entire cast superb, top-notch. The prologue explains that the film is 'based' on the Odyssey. What more does one want? I expect that some reviewers here would be bored by the creation of the Universe or the Apocalypse.",9,3,6,9 January 2009
Brokeback Mountain," Terrific Love Story!
",Just watched 'Brokeback Mountain' for the 3rd time and it's not a gay cowboy movie nor is it a gay film. It is a love story about two men who develop a friendship working together and evolves unintentionally into more than they are able to handle. They realize the hopelessness of their situation but their feelings for each other are too strong to shake off. Both try to lead 'normal' lives by dating women and eventually marrying and having children but over the years they find they cannot purge the feelings they have for each other. A heartbreaking scene is when one blames the other for his 'shame'. The fault is neither's and that seems to be the message and a poignant one it is. This is truly a beautiful film no matter what one's feelings are.,9,8,8,22 August 2009
X-Men," Redefines the Comic Book Genre!
","I've always enjoyed watching comic book and comic strip characters 'come alive' on screen whether TV or movies. Even the cheesy serials of the 1940s & 50s were wonderful to watch as kids. With Spider-Man, and now X-Men, this genre has been reborn. As for X-Men, I couldn't agree more with the superlatives used by reviewers here. Brian Singer has given this film energy, style and class, sophistication, believability and he has raised the genre to a new level. Not being a previous X-Men follower I can say with honesty that he introduced us to the many X-Men characters and their world superbly and told a terrific story to boot. What a challenge that had to be! The cast is so perfect, from Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) on down to Sabretooth (Tyler Mayne) who we'd like to see more of. The special effects are absolutely dazzling, the music score, cinematography, everything is so perfect. Singer and his cast have made these complex characters believable and that alone is astounding. Kudos must go to Stan Lee (who has a cameo in the film), the genius behind X-Men and the Marvel Comics empire. Now his unique imagination can be shared with movie-goers. Even better is the fact that this is just Part 1 of a trilogy and hopefully there will be more X-Men films to come.",9,0,1,6 May 2009
A Bridge Too Far," Fabulous War Film!
","In the tradition of other documentary style war dramas e.g. 'Tora! Tora! Tora!', 'Battle of the Bulge' and 'The Longest Day', to name a few, 'A Bridge Too Far' documents an ill-conceived mission designed to end the war earlier that failed miserably. Operation Market Garden was designed by Field Marshal Montgomery and many warnings and messages from various allies in occupied Holland were ignored causing many casualties to the military and Dutch citizenry. Like all these films it has a star studded cast of Brits, Americans and Germans including Sean Connery, Michael Caine, Edward Fox, Dirk Bogarde, Anthony Hopkins, Gene Hackman, Ryan O'Neal, Elliott Gould, James Caan, Robert Redford, Hardy Kruger, Maxmillian Schell and Liv Ullman as well as many recognizable character actors. The film is loaded with many very memorable scenes and terrific acting. It is beautifully filmed by Geoffrey Unsworth with an intelligent script by William Goldman and Cornelius Ryan who wrote the book. The music score by John Addison is brilliant and the main theme has become a standard for military bands. I saw this when it came out in 1977 and was quite impressed. Since then I have seen it multiple times on TV and have bought the DVD and now the Blu-Ray version which is incredibly beautiful. This is one not to miss.",9,0,1,26 April 2009
Cloverfield," Well Done! A Great Film!
","I got tired of perusing the negative reviews so I guess I don't understand what most of these people expected of this movie. By the time I first saw it I knew, from previews and reviews, what to expect. My expectations weren't extremely high so I was really taken in by this excellent film. This is a director's film, and Matt Reeves really delivered. He created a sense of confusion, claustrophobia, panic and excitement in a clever, creative way. The cast created believable characters and a sense of reality. The comments that there was no character development are ridiculous as how do you develop character in a chaotic situation in an 80 minute, real-time film? I'd say the cast did a fine job of character development in a most limited time frame. What do you want, their entire lineage and biography? They showed they cared for each other. What a weak criticism. I should give a tip of the hat to the FX people for a job well done. I actually felt like New York was being destroyed by some strange other-worldly force and I think that was the film's goal. Well done!",9,1,2,6 January 2009
Crash," A Great Film about our prejudices!
","This Oscar winner was deserving of its Oscar. It has a terrific cast including: Thandie Newton, Terrence Howard, Matt Dillon, Ryan Phillipe, Don Cheadle, Sandra Bullock and Brendan Fraser as well as some lesser known, but equally gifted character actors. Writer/Director Paul Haggis does an excellent job of keeping the proceedings moving along swiftly and smoothly. The story involves the way we, most people, tend to categorize ethnicity, behavior and actions stereotypically, which results in bigotry of varying degrees. The film asks will we ever be able to 'get along' together? Personally, I feel we ALL have to change our behavior towards one another before this can ever happen. We need to stop blaming each other and behave as human beings should. This film illustrates how we 'read' the behavior of others wrongly most of the time. We need to RESPECT: each other, the law, sexual behavior, all religions and creeds, our various ethnicities, the planet earth, our spaces, our countries and more. The world today lacks RESPECT! People toss their garbage and litter in the streets, they rarely say PLEASE and THANK YOU, they are less polite than 20 years ago, they live in their own little worlds, the education system has failed the last four or five generations. Kids are less creative because of computers, cell phones, violent video games, violent films, the internet. They don't respect their teachers, parents and authority figures as people did 20 years ago. Profanity is commonplace. The world is changing because of this and much of this is illustrated in 'Crash'. I hope it's not too late to change things around. Sorry, if this comes off as a downer, but I really am concerned about our (humanity's) future.",9,1,6,26 June 2009
Fargo," Superbly done Masterpiece!
","Being a Minnesotan I love to watch films made here or about Minnesota; films like: 'Purple Rain', 'Grumpy Old Men', 'Grumpier Old Men', 'Untamed Heart', 'North Country', 'Prairie Home Companion', 'The Heartbreak Kid' and others. 'Fargo', however, is my favorite Minnesota film. It's a typical Coen Brothers film and by far their best! Yeah, they make fun of our politeness and our Scandinavian-German accents. As kids we are taught at home and in school, as well as on the job to always say Please and Thank You, hold open doors for others, wait your turn, don't speak loudly or yell and we rarely use the word Yes, for us it's Ya. Some people were embarrassed by this but most of us are proud of our politeness and our Nordic roots. It's known as 'Minnesota Nice.' So, as for 'Fargo', most of us loved it. None of us talk like the Officer who says, 'I'm gonna have ta ask ya ta git outta da curr.' That said, most of the characters are spot on. Roger Deakins shows the bleakness of a prairie winter, but also its beauty. Carter Burwell's score has a tinge of Scandinavian folk to it. The Coens make fun of us but we don't mind because they've created a masterpiece in 'Fargo'. The cast is superb: Frances McDormand and John Carroll Lynch as Norm & Marge Gunderson are the heart of the film. Steve Buscemi as Carl Showalter, Peter Stormare as Gaear Grimsrud and William H. Macy as Jerry Lundegaard are a fine trio of bad guys. Kristin Rudrud as Jean Lundegaard, Harve Presnell as Wade Gustafson and Bruce Bohne as Marge's partner Lou are terrific. My favorite character of the cast has a small part but plays it brilliantly and is in my favorite scene. He is Bain Boehlke and he plays Mr. Mohra who is the guy shoveling his driveway and who is describing Carl Showalter as a 'funny looking guy'. I love that scene it really makes me laugh. In spite of its gore, the screenplay of 'Fargo' is incredibly fascinating and very entertaining from beginning to end. Bravo Joel and Ethan!",10,1,2,17 April 2009
Watchmen," True to its source!
","I saw the graphic novel/comic book version of this story first. I enjoyed it as I do most all film noir movies. I wondered how can they possibly transfer this to a live action film, especially Rorschach's mask. Wow, did Zack Snyder and crew deliver! This was a stunning, engrossing film. Page by page there was every scene from the book. The casting was perfection with Billy Crudup (Dr. Manhattan) and Jackie Earle Haley (Rorschach) leading the pack. Jeffrey Dean Morgan as (The Comedian), Carla Gugino and Malin Akerman (Silk Spectre I & 2), Stephen McHattie and Patrick Wilson (Night Owl I & II) and Matt Frewer (Moloch) and the rest looked like they just jumped off the pages of the comic book. The special effects were terrific as were the cinematography, music score, art design, sound effects. The acting was very impressive as was the script. Snyder kept things moving along nicely and that made a lengthy film seem go by quickly. I don't know how this will sit with those unfamiliar with the novel or comic book, but if they take the time to check out the book, they will enjoy the film.",9,2,5,9 August 2009
Cast Away," What a Magnificent Adventure!
","I have to admit that I had made up my mind I was not going to like this movie. I'd heard enough about Tom Hanks' two Oscars and actually hated 'Forest Gump'. At the time I thought Tom Hanks was way over-rated. I left the theater feeling bored and that 'Cast Away' was too long. Eventually I bought the DVD and I can't say why, but on viewing it I did a complete 360. I loved it! On subsequent viewings I realized it was a masterpiece and Tom Hanks is one of the major reasons why. He makes this adventure work from opening frame to the end. Someone here said this movie was depressing and if that's the case, so is life! Life does not always go as planned and this movie illustrates that with perfection. In a single moment one's whole life can change due to circumstance. Cast Away (not Castaway) is life affirming. We struggle to survive crisis, we do not give up. Things always work out if you give them a chance. I won't go into the plot, but rather would like to pick up on some of the film's interesting moments, some with unanswered questions. The film opens with an attractive female receiving and returning Fed-Ex packages. At the end Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) returns to deliver the only Fed-Ex package he saved but didn't open. The film ends with him pondering. Pondering what? Going back to talk to the girl? Wondering where he goes from here? I guess we choose the ending. Favorite scenes include: making fire (fun & funny), using the Fed-Exed skates to open an almost impenetrable coconut, using video tape as rope, building a raft, talking to Wilson, Wilson's face, losing Wilson at sea, encountering a whale, the arrival of the ship. One scene I cannot watch is self-dental surgery with a skate. It makes one want to go to the dentist more often to care for the teeth. Robert Zemeckis, a terrific director (save Forest Gump) deserves credit for his work. At first I thought it was too long, but a great film is never too long and deserves many viewings. Props also to Helen Hunt who shines in a fairly small role. Don Burgess' cinematography is stunningly beautiful and Alan Sylvestri's score is excellent. I urge people to give movies a second chance, if possible. We miss subtle details and sometimes more, on first viewing.",10,2,3,17 May 2009
The Thing," Comparisons - Pie & Cake
","To the many of you, who like me, gave this film a 10 out of 10 I cannot top your favorable reviews of this masterpiece and I do agree with almost everything you say, so I'll address the comparisons with E.T. made the same year..1982. These 2 films, although Sci-Fi are actually in different genres. E.T. is 'Sci-Fi Lite' much like Starman, Star Trek, Star Wars, Back to the Future 3 and Galaxy Quest to mention a few. They are warm, funny in some cases, awe inspiring and fascinating. E.T. delivers 100 fold in its genre and is definitely a 10 and a classic. John Carpenter's The Thing is 'Sci-Fi Horror' much like Alien, Aliens, Bloodsucker and Lifeforce, etc. As a horror flick it delivers with jaw-dropping effects, jump out of your seat action and palm sweating tension, and it, too, delivers 100 fold. It is a classic, still holds up after 25 years and is 10 out of 10. Both are masterpieces and it's not fair to compare them. It'd be like comparing pie & cake. Post Script: I would highly recommend viewing this film on Blu-Ray DVD as it looks spectacular. Children 13 or younger should not see this film.",10,9,13,18 November 2007
No Country for Old Men," A Good but not Great Movie!
","First off, I was surprised by all the negative comments, but I kind of felt that way after the first viewing of this film. It's typical Coen Brothers fare which means you come out of the theater saying, 'Huh?, What was that all about?' This one definitely ended before the end, in mid-story. Did Chigurh get away or does he die halfway down the block? Where is the money? Why did Sheriff Ed Tom Bell quit the chase? What happened to Carla Jean Moss? Did she win or lose the coin toss? I'm sure there are more questions but these would be the top questions. I, for one, am not fond of movies that you have to figure out. Those with multiple plot twists or flashbacks & flash-forwards. I favor a simple story well told. Still, I found value in 'No Country... The casting and acting was superb, from Javier Bardem's chilling Chigurh, Tommy Lee Jones' Sheriff Ed Tom's frustration at the world of the 80s to smaller roles like Barry Corbin's Ellis and Beth Grant as Carla Jean's cynical mother. The cinematography by Roger Deakins and the music score by Carter Burwell were topnotch as always. It was pretty gory but so was Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, and many other popular films. I think a second viewing helps the film a lot. Many films that I found mediocre on first viewing became some of my favorites after further viewings. Did it deserve its Oscar for Best Picture? No, but the Oscar was awarded for Fargo which lost its Best Picture Oscar to, of all things, 'The English Patient'. The Academy always gets it wrong.",8,0,2,16 April 2009
District 9," One of the Best Sci-Fi Films Ever!
","If this isn't the first Sci-Fi film to win an Oscar, there is no justice in the world. Not only that, a new star has been born with the unlikely name of Sharlto Copley. He is the lead in this roller coaster ride of a movie. The viewer goes through just about every emotion during this excellent film. It twists and turns, yet is not confusing as are many plot twisting films. The film has everything a film needs to become a classic. The casting, acting, directing, writing, cinematography, special effects, art direction, editing, music score, sound effects and other production values are top notch! I won't go into the story, as I knew little to nothing about District 9 when I saw it and that made it all the more enjoyable. Even its setting/location is perfect albeit very different. There is some gore and violence but it serves only as 'dressing' and is not gratuitous. I should single out its writer/director Neil Blomkamp for his originality and meticulous directing of this new Masterpiece. I highly recommend this film.",10,3,8,19 August 2009
The Princess Bride," Princess Bride gets better with every viewing!
","I first saw this film during the 5th Game of the 1987 World Series, an intense game (my Minnesota Twins vs. the Atlanta Braves), that I just couldn't watch. My mind wasn't on the film, so I couldn't appreciate it as I knew whoever won that Game would take the series. After that I began to see it on TV and video and realized it was an OK film. My most recent viewing on the Blu-Ray DVD helped me not only enjoy the beauty of its cinematography, but its story, pacing, acting, directing, music score, swordplay and stunts. The cast is perfection save for over-the-top performances by Billy Crystal & Carol Kane. Cary Elwes shines as both a humble farm-boy and later as a debonair, swashbuckling pirate in his portrayal of the hero Westley. Wallace Shawn is brilliant as Vizzini, a sly but silly, lisping villain, Andre the Giant is absolutely charming as Fezzik the hulking, but kindly Giant, Mandy Patinkin is terrific as Inigo Montoya the dashing Spanish swashbuckler as are Chris Sarandon as evil Prince Humperdinck and Christopher Guest as Count Rugin the six-fingered scoundrel. Robin Wright was stunningly beautiful and endearing as Buttercup and Peter Falk and Fred Savage as Storyteller and grandson were fine. The story is clever, funny, dashingly adventurous and expertly directed by Rob Reiner. I even liked the song Storybook Love by Mark Knopfler. You must see it on Blu-Ray DVD, it's AWESOME. BTW, the Braves won that game but my Twins won the World Series.",8,1,3,14 February 2010
Revolutionary Road," For what it is, it's well done!
","This is not a movie I'd want to see when I'm in a downer mood. I do get the film's message, that marriage can be a struggle for some. Being a single guy who never married, sometimes I wish I'd married and other times I'm glad I didn't. Watching this film I saw what a struggle it can be and back in the 50s divorce was pretty much scorned upon. So many people lived loveless marriages. Many made the best of the situation. Most folks I know seem to have adapted well and make the best of their marriages. To this day I see very few couples holding hands or snuggling up. It seems that marriage isn't what it's cracked up to be for a lot of people or is it that as people age they're less affectionate, at least in public. Revolutionary Road begins with the initial and strong attraction between the principle characters. Was it love or just physical attraction? As the marriage goes on they settle into the 'American Dream', a nice house, a well paying but boring job, two little beautiful kids. After the marriage all is well until the monotony moves in. They make plans to move to Paris, kids and all, to fulfill their dreams but then reality hits them and she becomes pregnant. They grow tired of each other and everything gets worse. There are reasons for all of this and they are evident. Sam Mendes has put a beautiful, but very sad story, on screen brilliantly. It takes place in the 1950s and the art direction is fabulous. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are superb as is the supporting cast. Thomas Newman's music score is perfection as is Roger Deakins cinematography. I prefer happier, more uplifting films but I must admit that this is a very good film!",8,1,2,28 September 2009
X-Men: The Last Stand," A Good Ending for the Trilogy with some faults!
","I have to preface this with a reminder that I knew nothing of the X-Men prior to the Trilogy. I liked the movie but with some reservations. I agree with those who maintained that character development of the new X-Men was insufficiently lacking. As for some other supposed glitches mentioned, I found nothing seriously affecting the film. I agree that the film moved too fast and that a few more scenes would have filled some holes rather than drag it down. Still, I enjoyed the film and felt a little sad that this was the end. The deaths of key characters was disturbing but likely necessary. New characters including: Beast (Kelsey Grammar), Angel (Ben Foster), Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), Colossus (Daniel Cudmore), Multiple Man (Eric Dane), Leech (Cameron Bright), Phat and Little Phat, Flea, Arclight, Lizard Man, Psylocke, Kid Omega and of course the disturbing Phoenix (Famke Jansen) are just lightly touched upon with little to no back-story. I would not have minded an extra 90 minutes added to fill in the blanks. Hopefully there will be more X-Men films, either prequels, sequels or sidebar stories as in 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine'.",9,0,0,6 May 2009
Stardust," One of the Top Fantasy Films!
","While it doesn't come close to 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy, 'Star Wars' or 'The Wizard of Oz', it is a pretty decent little fantasy/fairy tale film. I'd rank it with 'Labyrinth', 'The Princes Bride', 'The Dark Crystal', 'The Spiderwick Chronicles' and other very good fantasy films. The cast is terrific with Charlie Cox and Claire Danes as the two leads and a supporting cast of Peter O'Toole, Robert DeNiro, Michelle Pfeiffer, Ricky Gervaise, David Kelly, Sienna Miller and others. It has a very nice film score, dazzling special effects, wonderful cinematography of Scotland, Iceland and elsewhere and an involving story. It is quite long, but moves at a good pace. It has action, mystery, suspense and humor. What more could one ask of a neat little family movie. It's a quest movie with a complex plot that would be better seen than described. I'd recommend this as a nice rental for a rainy or winter's day.",8,2,3,22 July 2009
Gran Torino," Eastman's Still Got It!
","This movie was so enjoyable to watch. It's one of those movies that you just can't guess what's going to happen next. It was funny, touching, spiritual, evocative and completely engrossing. It has it all: a terrific cast including newcomers Bee Vang, Ahney Her, Christopher Carley and veteran character actor John Caroll Lynch; a terrific story by Dave Johansson and Nick Schenk; great direction by Clint Eastwood and everything a great movie needs to succeed. This is a tribute to both Clint Eastwood the director and Clint Eastwood the actor. I don't understand why it didn't do better at Oscar time. If there's a moral to the story, it's 'don't judge a book by its cover!' Human beings can learn an excellent lesson in behavior just by watching this film. I think this may be Clint's Masterpiece.",9,2,7,14 June 2009
The Longest Day," Truly one of the Great World War II Films
","Since I was a kid in the 1950s I have been in awe over what sacrifices our men made on D-Day and throughout WWII. It's impossible to put yourself in their place at that time. It all comes alive in 'The Longest Day'. This is and will always remain, a stunning film. It is brilliantly pieced together by three plus directors covering the German, French, English and British points of view. It has an all-star cast of anyone who was anything in 1962, the year it was made. Told in brilliant documentary style, it begins in occupied Europe focusing on the French Resistance and the Germans obtaining secret D-Day plans. Then we see the Allies in England planning, organizing and preparing for the Invasion, many already on board ships awaiting for the go-ahead. The weather plays a role in itchy anticipation. Everyone awaits the 'word' from Ike (Gen. Eisenhower). Soon the action begins with unbelievably memorable scenes i.e. the German seeing the entire Allied fleet out the window of his bunker; parachutists landing in the middle of the German occupied town of St. Mere Iglise; a patrol of Germans and Americans passing each other in the dark unaware of each other; a glider landing smack in front of a German foxhole and it goes on from there and never gets boring or bogged down. Filming in black and white paid off in spades. It does contain inaccuracies but they are mostly minor. It does not have quite the intensity of 'Saving Private Ryan' but the film delivers and has become a classic.",10,1,5,22 August 2009
The Nightmare Before Christmas," A Masterpiece that gets better every time you see it!
","This film is an audio and visual treat. It delivers masterful animation combined with great music and fabulous songs. Danny Elfman is an under-appreciated and underrated film composer who creates wonderful music in multiple films and has yet to be awarded for his terrific work. Here in 'Nightmare Before Christmas' he really shines with catchy tunes and a magnificent score. The visuals are unusual and brilliant and Tim Burton's crew deserves high praise for their fastidious work and meticulous animation. Burton and Michael McDowell have created a truly unique story and director Henry Selick puts all these elements together with perfection. The characters are unforgettable: Jack Skellington the Pumpkin King (Voiced by Danny Elfman and Chris Sarandon), Sally the Frankenstein-like doll who pines for Jack (Voiced by Catherine O'Hara), nasty Dr. Finkelstein the mad scientist (Voiced by William Hickey) and other ghosts, ghouls and vampires are wonderfully created and performed. It is a classic that will only improve with age and viewers will catch something new on every viewing. The Blu-Ray DVD is absolutely stunning.",10,1,2,4 May 2009
Dumb and Dumber," If you want to laugh....watch this film?
","I just watched this on DVD after a few years and it still delivers in spades! I was watching it at 3:00 a.m. and I had to laugh into a towel so I wouldn't wake up the people in my Apt. building. To those who don't find it funny, I understand. If you don't like certain actors or comedians, you can't enjoy any film they're in. For me it's Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider and David Spade. I won't even watch their films. That said, I think Dumb & Dumber is one of the funniest, laugh-out- loud movies of all time! Yet it wasn't even recognized by the AFI on their ludicrous List of 100 Greatest Comedies. They listed Laurel & Hardy at #99. What a bunch of snobs! Getting back to D&D, Jim Carrey is at his best. Jeff Daniels actually keeps pace with the frenetic Mr. Carrey. He wondered if this would be a bad career move. This performance compared with his previous role in 'Gettysburg' just shows his range as an actor. They're on opposite ends of the spectrum and both are equally great in their genres. I'll admit that a few of the 'gross out' jokes are a bit much, but all in all this movie is hilarious! Yes, it's stupid and dumb but what do you want in a comedy...Shakespeare? I highly recommend this film to anyone with a great sense of humor.",10,2,5,6 January 2009
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Stunning in every sense of the word!
","Wow, this film hit me hard. Initially I was caught up by the stunningly awesome visuals. The beauty of the city and countryside scenes, the ambiance of the homes and elegance of the lifestyles these people lived, all the while realizing that this family is deeply flawed by the father's position. Slowly but surely we begin to experience the contrasts when we see an emaciated old man acting as servant/slave. He is a gentle, kindly, but worn out character and we feel for him as does the youngest, innocent member of the family. The film gradually turns from elegant and beautiful to heartbreaking and horrific. As always in Holocaust themed films we are again asking ourselves what kind of people can perpetrate such horrors on other human beings? This film is difficult to evaluate because it starts out in one direction and turns to horror and probably one of the most difficult to watch scenes ever put on film. Some people will hate the ending but the point it makes is, ultimately, extremely important for everyone to see and discuss. I would recommend it for everyone over 13 years of age.",10,2,3,17 March 2009
Avatar," A True Movie Experience!
","James Cameron scores again! I have seen this terrific film three times now. First in the theater in 3-D, the best way to truly experience its awe and beauty, and twice on Blu-Ray DVD. This film is like nothing you've seen on film before. First off, it is visually stunning and brilliantly imaginative. It has everything a film needs to be a classic: fast paced direction, a fine cast, awesome cinematography by Mauro Fiore, a beautiful music score by the brilliant James Horner, unbelievable special effects by a fabulous crew of hundreds, fantastic sound and sound effects which make one feel like they are there on the planet Pandora. James Cameron is expert at directing wonderful films and he finds such talented people to work with. The cast is overall very good with the likes of Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana and Sigourney Weaver in the lead roles and such stalwarts as Giovanni Ribisi, Michelle Rodriguez, Wes Studi, CCH Pounder and Stephen Lang in the supporting roles.. Many criticize the storyline, but I find little wrong with it. It borrows from Dances with Wolves, Braveheart and maybe Wall Street. It mainly deals with corporate greed. Topical? Hmmm. It's main selling point is truly the visuals, but the story is involving and the cast is good. I felt Stephen Lang played it a little over-the-top, but that's excusable. Cameron likes a bit of gung hoi-sm in his films. I find that so far the film holds up very well after 3 viewings and I'm sure it will after many more viewings. I wish I had a 3D TV.",10,2,4,20 August 2010
Reservoir Dogs," A Disgusting piece of GARBAGE!
","What is wrong with Quentin Tarantino? The guy thinks of nothing but vile, despicable violence. His worst piece of trash is Natural Born Killers, but piece of crap..Reservoir Dogs is really disgusting. But what is more disturbing than the film is how so many people revere it. What have we come to? This film made me gag and want to throw up. What possible message comes from a film such as this? All I can say is God help us!",1,33,68,2 December 2001
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Very Disappointing!
","I am reviewing the DVD version of this sequel to the very clever and wonderful Transformers film. This one is lacking in a lot of things: story, plot, coherence, good dialog and much more. It is utterly confusing at some points, very loud and noisy, the characters are not as endearing as in the first film. I'm getting tired of Shia LaBeouf's rat-a-tat, rambling, improv style of speech. He acts like he's on speed and Megan Fox comes off as a bitchy spoiled brat, Kevin Dunn and Julie White as LaBeouf's parents act idiotic up until towards the end of the film when the seem to 'snap out of it'. There are way too many Transfomers (hint: less is more) and it becomes confusing determining just who's who? The film was terribly paced by director Michael Bay, who comes off on the DVD like some kind of jerk in his attitude. I will say that the effects are good, as are the stunts, but there are way too many. The plot was OK but took forever to unfold. It's not the worst film out there, but it could have been so much better.",7,0,2,10 November 2009
There Will Be Blood," Interesting!
","To me this is a good film, an interesting film, but not a great film. Its biggest asset is Daniel Day-Lewis' fantastic performance. He was deserving of both of his Oscars (My Left Foot also), that's for sure! The story is both confusing and fascinating. Watching a man evolve from hard worker to innovator to oil magnate and in the process watching his soul decay. Perhaps he was in a soul-less state from the start and we just find out as the story unfolds. Initially he appears to be a man with goals but also a loving and caring father, or foster father and a man who shares his wealth and progress with others but ultimately we see his ulterior motives. The production values are quite impressive and the supporting cast is fine. My question is: 'What's the moral of this story?' I found myself very unsympathetic to the townsfolk, the so-called preacher Eli, the leach who posed as a brother to Daniel Plainview and even the some of the oil workers. I very often hear film critics saying: 'I couldn't relate to the characters in the film' and then they pan it. Well, I didn't like most of the characters in this film save for H.W., Mary Sunday and Fletcher (Ciaran Hinds) who cared for the kid. Still, I liked the film. So what's with these film critics? They use the lamest reasons for panning a film.",8,2,4,20 April 2009
Ice Age," An Animated film for All ages!
","One of the truly finest examples of animation in the new age of computer animated films. This little film has it all, a very funny script, delightful characters, a perfect cast of voice actors, fantastic animation, a terrific score by David Newman, poignant scenes and a sweet story of animals trying to survive the ice age. Ray Romano does a great job as Manny the Mammoth, John Leguizamo is fine as Sid the Sloth, Dennis Leary is perfect as Diego the fierce sabre tooth tiger who learns the meaning of friendship and the character of Skrat the wacky squirrel, voiced by director Chris Wedge, steals every scene he's in and becomes a star. The plot involves an unlikely trio of animals trying to deliver a lost human child back to his tribe. Kudos to all the animators, artists, technicians and everyone else involved in this wonderful film.",9,0,0,7 May 2009
The Green Mile," Perfection!
","'The Green Mile' is a GREAT movie, a Masterpiece. In a great movie everything 'clicks' during the filming and this is a perfect example. The cast of Green Mile is so perfect that one cannot picture or imagine anyone else in these roles. The most crucial character in this film was John Coffey, and he was the last one cast. John Coffey is such a complex character not only in psychologically but in physical appearance. Michael Clarke Duncan was suggested by Bruce Willis, who'd read Stephen King's book, at the last moment and he delivered in spades. He is the heart of this movie. The other cast members: the always dependable, Tom Hanks, David Morse and James Cromwell, the brilliant Sam Rockwell and Barry Pepper, the terrific character actors Jeffrey DeMunn, Graham Greene, Harry Dean Stanton and veteran Dabbs Greer, along with Bonnie Hunt and Patricia Clarkson and newcomer Doug Hutchison. The late Michael Jeter turned in an Oscar worthy performance as the Cajun prisoner Eduard Delacroix. Last but not least was Mr. Jingles the talented mouse, who was portrayed by a group of equally talented stunt-mice. Frank Darabont deserves credit for his vision and directing which put everything into place. Kudos also to David Tattersall's stunning cinematography, Thomas Newman's whimsical score and to Stephen King for a brilliant story. There are so many great scenes in this film that it's difficult to single out one, but the scene where Paul Edgecombe (Hanks) asks John Coffey (Duncan) what he can do for him, when he knows Coffey is innocent is extremely poignant. I should also give credit to Terence Marsh and William Cruse who 'created' the Green Mile set. This film is on a par with its counterpart 'The Shawshank Redemption' also by Stephen King and directed by Frank Darabont.",10,2,4,17 February 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," Jaw-droppingly Great Film - At the Top of Everyone's List!
","There are so many reviews here that it'd be amazing if anyone gets this far down the List, but it just proves how excellent this film is. Why didn't it win the Best Picture Oscar? Simple, because the Oscar voters, like most of us, hadn't seen it yet. Most people blame the title and the title does nothing to sell the film. It sounds like a religious film as did 'Deliverance'. It was definitely not promoted well at all. I would bet the farm that most people on this list of reviews DID NOT see it in a theater. I didn't, but since my first viewing of it on DVD, I've seen it at least 6 times. I loaned my DVD out to friends, relatives and neighbors and not one of them said it was less than excellent, and I'm talking some fussy movie watchers and folks who rarely watch movies. Why? Because it's an engrossingly fabulous story, told extremely well by gifted filmmakers and crew. It has everything a great movie has to have...stunning cinematography, crisp, swift-moving direction, an intelligent script, an emotionally moving score, a top-notch cast and more. If there's anyone who saw 'it' coming, I'd say you're fibbing, as it is anything but predictable. What more can one say! Excellent!",10,2,4,1 February 2009
Centurion," A Surprising Gem of a film!
","I stumbled on the DVD of 'Centurion' knowing nothing about it and was rewarded with a fascinating, involving and enjoyable film. I figured it was probably a Roman epic film, which is a genre I truly enjoy, but it was even more. It involves the Roman invasion of Britain and their eventual confrontations with the Picts in Northern Scotland which led to the building of Hadrian's Wall (which still stands to this day). The Wall was built as the end of the Roman line in Britain AND to keep out the Picts. The film is well cast, expertly directed, cinematically stunning with its cold landscapes and it really moves along at a furious pace while never 'boring' the viewer. Michael Fassbender plays Quintus Dias, the titular Centurion whose Roman stronghold has been attacked by the Picts. Because he speaks the Pict language he is taken hostage and while in captivity learns much about the Picts. He escapes and encounters Rome's famed 9th Legion. They are about to quell the 'Pict situation' led by a Pict scout, Etain (Olga Kurylenko) who is leading them straight into a deadly ambush. From there the story builds into an escape for survival. Dominic West is excellent as the legendary General Titus Flavius Virilus, leader of the Roman 9th Legion as are Ulric Thomsen as Gorlacon, King of the Picts; David Morrissey as Bothos a fellow escapee; Imogen Poots is lovely as Arianne the witch and the rest of the cast also shines. This is a Braveheart type epic with bloody battles and a fascinating story based on truth. There was a Roman 9th Legion who headed into Scotland and was never seen nor heard of again. Although this story is speculation by writer/director Neil Marshall, it is based on various facts and actual historical figures. I do not understand the first review here where the reviewer could not empathize with the Romans, as they were invaders, nor the savage Picts. To me this is like blaming soldiers for policy for which they are not involved. This is more a story of humans rather than soldiers or warriors and survival rather than war or conflict. I highly recommend this film, but a warning for those who cannot take scenes of blood and gore; this film has some of those!",9,4,8,15 November 2010
Tombstone," One of the All-Time Great Westerns!
","It took me about three viewings to appreciate this movie the way it deserves. Sometimes when you watch a film alone and uninterrupted you can really get 'into it' and that was the case for me. This great western has it all: a terrific cast, great dialog, deft directing, stunning cinematography, a wonderful music score, plenty of action and even narration by the great Robert Mitchum. At 129 minutes, it moves along swiftly with no unnecessary scenes or dragging. The cast, led by Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer, are perfection, many turning in their greatest performances ever, especially Kilmer and Sam Elliott. I'm not a historian, but it seemed to me to be fairly accurate in its facts. Of all its pluses, I can't say enough about the cast. Powers Booth, Stephen Lang, Michael Biehn, Billy Bob Thornton and Thomas Haden Church all portray terrific villains, while Kilmer, Russell, Elliott, Harry Carey Jr., Buck Taylor, Bill Paxton, Charlton Heston, Billy Zane and Jason Priestley are solid as the good guys. Dana Delaney, Paula Malcomson, Lisa Collins and Dana Wheeler-Nicholson are the love interests. Besides all the great western action, this film is about love, loyalty, friendship and life choices. See it on blu-ray DVD to really enjoy the sights and sounds of this fabulous western!",9,6,9,7 May 2010
Signs," Another M. Night Shyamalan WINNER!
","Take it from a sci-fi fan, this is an excellent movie. Again those who criticize it are clueless. What makes it work are many things; the way the aliens are filmed where you see only shadows and quick shots of them and especially those creepy clicking sounds they make. The actors are well cast and highly effective in moving things along and adding to the film's authenticity. Tak Fujimoto's brilliant cinematography also adds realism and moodiness to the proceedings as does James Newton Howard's score. Mel Gibson is great as usual as is Joaquin Phoenix who adds a touch of humor to the story. Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin in her film debut illustrate why they are exceptional young actors. Shyamalan's pacing and techniques are indicative of his film making talent. His screenplay makes this just as much a testing of one's faith tale as it is a science fiction story. I am hoping that Shyamalan will re-discover the creativity of his early films as they are exceptional works of film-making.",9,0,4,23 April 2009
X2: X-Men United," Another Brilliant X-Men Outing!
","Now that Brian Singer has introduced us to the X-Men and their world we can sit back and watch them in action and, after this entry in the X-Men Trilogy, we can't wait for more! This one introduces us to Nightcrawler, Pyro, Deathstrike, Ice Man, Jubilee, Kitty Pryde, Siryn and a nasty human, William Stryker (the brilliant Brian Cox). We get to know and enjoy these characters in a tense story of humans out to annihilate our heroes. Wolverine, Storm, Mystique, Rogue and Cyclops are back as are Magneto and Dr. X to carry us through another thrilling X-Men adventure, again brilliantly and stylishly directed by Brain Singer. There are more excellent special effects, stunning images, fantastic stunts and some shocking surprises for us to enjoy this time around and by the closing credits we are left eagerly anticipating the next X-Men adventure.",9,0,0,6 May 2009
The Sixth Sense," A Director is Born and a Star is Born!
","Do not read this if you have not seen this movie. Unfortunately someone asked me a question about Sixth Sense before I had seen it and I missed out on the experience that this Masterpiece delivers to its viewers. I'll never know if I might've 'had a clue.' This film was brilliantly conceived and pieced together by M. Night Shyamalan. It was perfectly cast and Haley Joel Osment became a star through his work in this film. Bruce Willis was never better and Donnie Wahlberg was magnificent in a brief, but key role. Toni Collette and Olivia Williams and the rest of the cast all make it work so well. Being the creator of the Great Character Actors Web Page, I very much appreciate supporting actors who rarely get the credit they deserve. Finally, I see M. Night Shyamalan as the 'new' Hitchcockian director. Although some of his more recent efforts have not been well received, I think he has a lot more surprises and 'treasures' in store for us. Hitchcock had his 'Marnie', 'Topaz' and 'Torn Curtain' yet he gave us 'Psycho', 'North by Northwest' and 'Frenzy' just to name a few!",9,0,0,19 April 2009
300," Very Entertaining Film!
","My brother and I absolutely loved the 1962 film '300 Spartans' based on the amazing 'Battle of Thermopylae' fought in 480 B.C. with the Greek City States of the time fighting the entire Persian Empire led by King Xerxes. The astounding stand of the 300 Spartans who held the Persians at bay at the Thermopylae Pass while the rest of Greece observed a holy festival. The original was a low-budget film with inferior special effects as its only fault. My brother and I always hoped for a remake, although we still revered the original. When I learned of the news of the 2006 production 4 years earlier, we waited with great anticipation. '300' wasn't quite what we'd hoped for but it is a very entertaining 'comic book' version with a visually stunning style. The producers filmed the story as myth rather than reality, but it works well!",9,1,1,17 May 2009
Braveheart," Emotional, Stunning, Brilliant Masterpiece!
","I can't believe I haven't reviewed this, my co-favorite (with Dances with Wolves), No. 1 film that I've ever seen. I just couldn't pick between the two. Both films move me emotionally in similar ways. Mel Gibson's masterpiece actually affected/inspired the vote for Scotland's devolution. It gave the Scottish people a strong sense of pride in their heritage, something they seemed to lack when it came to voting for independence. Anyone who knows a bit of Scottish history knows that the film contains many inaccuracies, but this story is based on a poem by Blind Harry and little is known of William Wallace outside of that. The basic story plot is true. The murder of his wife definitely drove him to act against the English tyranny of Edward the 1st (Longshanks). Certain details are off, as the Battle of Stirling was fought on a bridge over marshlands, the romance between Wallace and the princess never happened as she was a mere child when Wallace died. Kilts are also questionable as they were not worn commonly at that time. Yet the story of William Wallace is legend. He beat the English against incredible odds, as he had much fewer men. He united a divided Scotland to fight for Freedom. He inspired Robert the Bruce to act for Scotland and not the throne. Gibson tells the story brilliantly with the help of cinematographer John Toll, who brilliantly captures Scotland's rugged, rustic beauty, and a fine cast of actors led by himself, Angus Macfadyen, Patrick McGoohan, Brendan Gleeson, James Cosmo, Brian Cox, Ian Bannen, Tommy Flannagan and the gorgeous ladies, Catherine McCormack and Sophie Marceau. His use of symbolism is excellent. I especially liked his use of the thistle, which is the Flower of Scotland, its main symbol along with the Saltire or St. Andrew's Cross which is on Scotland's flag. In the film, Wallace has saved the thistle Murron gave him as a child and he gives it to her as a gift of love. She in turn embroiders a thistle on a cloth which she gives to him at their wedding and this gift becomes even more of a symbol. Also, the blue warpaint that early Celtic warriors used was symbolic. James Horner's music score is magnificent and moving, Randall Wallace's script is exceptional and stirring in spite of its inaccuracies. The Sons of Scotland speech always moves me to tears as it reminds me of the sadness of Scotland's history. God, I love this movie!Post Script: To fully enjoy this film I highly recommend the blu-ray DVD which has crystal sharp clarity in picture and sound, new Extra Features which explain the history and also inaccuracies, plus new interviews with the cast and crew.",10,2,5,7 September 2009
Gladiator," Terrific Historical Epic!
","This movie ranks up there with Ben Hur, Spartacus, The Fall of the Roman Empire (the same story as Gladiator minus the Gladiator and with the second best chariot race on film), Quo Vadis, The Robe and others. The cast is superb from Oscar winner Russell Crowe to Joaquin Phoenix, the late, great Richard Harris, Oliver Reed (in his last role), David Hemming, Derek Jacobi, Connie Nielsen, Djimon Honsou and the rest. Ridley Scott keeps it moving at break-neck pace and has created a masterpiece. I won't go into the plot, but I will say it is nail biting tense, stunningly beautiful, very moving and even heartbreaking. If there's not enough action in this one for you, well then, you'll never be satisfied. I should mention the awesomely magnificent music score by the great Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard. If you enjoy a great Epic film, then this is for you.",10,1,2,5 September 2009
