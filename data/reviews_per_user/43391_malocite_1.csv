Requiem for a Dream," Pure Rubbish
","The one liner says it all, this is one of the most terrible, and disturbing things I have ever seen on screen.  I could not bring myself to finish the movie.  If you're looking for something uplifting, or life altering, this is not the film.  If you want to see a bunch of looser junkies sticking needles in their arms and having sex try downtown Toronto, but if you don't want to leave the house to do any of that... try this film.  (I use the term lightly)Howard",1,9,19,12 January 2002
