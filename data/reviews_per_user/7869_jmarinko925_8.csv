Blade Runner 2049," A Sci Fi favorites return that improves upon it's predecessor loved it!
",Somehow I never saw the original Blade runner but was fortunate enough to catch a double feature last night enjoy the original and see 2049 right after without waiting decades for the follow up. 2049 is true to it's predecessor and expands upon it masterfully. Tie ins to the original are not forced but ever-present and enjoyable. The second and third acts are filled with suspense and more action than the first. The film opens with action then begins to lay groundwork for the rising suspense and climax to come. While there are a good amount of cameos no performance is wasted or unnecessary. I should point out that this is not a Harrison Ford movie alone it is a Blade runner movie. An excellent one at that and while he is not the star his moments on screen are perfectly timed in his return to the iconic role as Deckard. A long run time was not discouraging but rather necessary to reveal the complex Sci Fi world that is Blade Runner.,9,9,22,6 October 2017
It," A Straightforward Frightfest! More brutal, violent and horrific than predecessor!
","It is not a film that disappoints the genre it represents at all. The scenes depicted in the trailer are not the only scary or climatic parts of the film either and are cut well to misdirect what the viewer expects to happen. This a full steam ahead something(Pennywise) wants to catch you and kill you suspense horror film. The psychological horror aspect is present as the antagonist preys on the characters fears of course but that is all.In recent years successful horror films have succeeded in a welcome misdirection from jump scares and building on the viewers anxiety. Well crafted tales like Conjuring, The Ring and Insidious all excellent horror films are examples of this. It(2017) is an excellent horror film but in another manner. There is the psychological horror but more than that it is a welcome return to one of the genres most beloved and terrifying themes the boogeyman. A boogeyman that above all else just wants to capture and kill kids. Just explaining this sounds frightening.I enjoyed the It miniseries from years back and for a TV movie it was achieved in retelling the novel in dramatic fashion. This film tells the master of horrors story in horrific fashion. Myself and the group I saw this with all enjoyed IT and had no negative feelings whatsoever.My rating of 8 out of 10 could without question be higher if not for issues with the audience in the theater. Half way through the film I had to exit the theater and report to management the few rotten apples ruining the film by talking through most of the film.*Note* I missed a crucial part of the middle act as it is intolerable and impossible to enjoy a film with private conversations being carried on in the theater. I strongly urge fellow film goer's if this happens do not endure this or confront the ignorant party disturbing the film.Confrontations just make more disturbances simply go to the box office and demand a refund. I had to do just this and while I returned and saw the rest of the film. The obnoxious parties were scolded, embarrassed and told they would be ejected from the theater if their disruption continued.I look forward to reviewing It without interruption and was thrilled with the film overall.",8,5,10,16 September 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Good Spiderman, great cameos,wonderful villain boring Movie
","I think many can agree that Spider Man's shield stealing scene in Captain America Civil War II revitalized our hopes for a fresh take on the web slinger and had us (present company included)counting down the days to Homecomings release. While Tom Hollands Spider-Man is good(inspite of him getting a beating from the most mundane thugs) and Michael Keaton's Vulture(is it okay to call him that? they never did in the movie?)is an excellent villain whose origin played out well and made sense in the movie there was just entirely to much Peter Parker and school going on. His sidekick was humorous but Spider-Man never needed nor had a sidekick and this left me hoping he never does again. Better than average is fine for a character who has never had a previous on screen appearance(Ant man was a blast with no expectation)but this is Spider-Man were talking about here.I understand a different direction was needed from Amazing Spider-Man 2 and Andrew Garfield's socially awkward loner Spider-Man but I enjoyed that much more and feel that was more authentic to the characters roots. Sure there are excellent cameo's from the rest of Marvel's cinematic universe but when there's no action on screen this is a bit of a snooze. I left the theatre feeling about this ,the way I did with similar films great no. Good enough to make another one absolutely! They all cant great can they? I definitely look forward to more of Marisa Tomei's Aunt May though as well as Thor Ragnorak which should be excellent.",6,7,12,12 July 2017
Split," A Suspense Thriller With Bright Spots & A Great Performance
",I watched Split this past weekend after missing it's theatrical run.Intrigued by the fast paced heart pounding trailer I was eager for the suspense master of our day's take on mental disorder and captivity.Split stars out with a bang and we are slowly introduced to the many personalities of our main character who suffers from multiple personality disorder. James McAvoy is amazing in split without doubt as he takes us through the many different representatives occupying this troubled soul. One scene in particular will stay with you as it is suspenseful as much as it is hysterical! There are disturbing and unfortunately drawn out flashbacks that get in the way of the suspense created by the captives situation. As usual M.Knight gives the viewer the thrilling finale with a satisfying twist for those familiar with his previous films and optimistically something to look forward to for a follow up. This is one of my favorite genres and I realize it is not easy to shock and thrill audiences that's why I will keep coming back and am glad M.Knight Is still at it.,5,0,4,2 June 2017
Dunkirk," Perhaps the 'ART' of war should be left to Sun Tzu
",Talk about putting the bore in war! I saw Dunkirk's extended preview trailer in the Imax Hubble theatre and was excited by the tension presented by the fighter pilot scene as well as the scenes cutting in between. That was as good as this film got . A half hour to forty five minutes in I felt myself wanting it to be over and fast. Sweeping shots of the ocean and a high-powered tension building score were not enough to salvage this incredibly dull movie. The film is loaded with no name characters. It has plenty of stars just the characters you will identify as the guy who was burying the guy A multitude of character's scattered in different situations that you can not identify and by the time that you realize who is who you will not care as you will be begging for it to be over.From a cinematic standpoint Dunkirk may get high marks but it is not entertaining at all. An incredibly dull of a summer movie. So boring it was funny my friends and I laughed in the parking lot afterwards about how sufferable a sit thru this was and how badly we'd been had going to see it.,3,14,23,26 July 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Another action packed, fun filled, hilarious Guardians Film!
","I went and saw Guardians of The Galaxy 2 last night and it delivers the goods as expected. High throttle space adventure with humor and action at every turn.The film will also address and answer some question's we (the viewer ) may have had origin wise after the first film and naturally opens up doors for ongoing Marvel multiverse sagas.I did not see the first film in the theatre even at the suggestion of a friend telling me how good it was. Although I am a comic book fan I could not get my head around the whole raccoon shooting a machine gun aspect. I was wrong. Dead wrong ,the first film leaves you loving every one of these characters and I would not make the same mistake twice.Guardians 2 picks up shortly after the end of the first film. The soundtrack Awesome Mix Vol.2 provides an excellent backdrop to the scenes it compliments. Chris Pratt's Star-Lord is wonderful once again as he plays the all heart and soul heroic lead. Zoe Salanda returns as the lovely Gamora who in addition to the her kick ass no nonsense character from the first film has personal conflicting issues of her own to address in this installment. Dave Bautista's Drax the Destroyer entertains and shines throughout the entire film his humor, misplaced sincerities and fighting reckless abandon make him a favorite of the guardians for me. The team is missing some muscle as opposed to the first go round as Groot is now Baby Groot no longer the bad guy bodying henchman once again voiced by Vin Disel. What Groot lacks in physical stature in this film he certainly makes up for in charm. It is worth noting that while short handed groot's strength we see the Guardians functioning and fighting in cohesion as a team which is a joy to see.Rocket voiced by Bradley Copper's space tech weaponry alone is a special effects vision to experience.We are also introduced to a good amount of new exciting characters as well as some outstanding cameo's. Strong supporting performances as well from Karen Gillian as Gamora's sister Nebula who returns as well as many others. Mantis a new character in the Guardians saga is characterized by Pom Klementieff and provides the film with an emotional and sincere aspect as well.My personal favorite in the film is Michael Rooker's Ravager Leading space pirate Yondu Udonta. The character is fun exciting, funny,emotional and and in certain moments in this installment downright excellent. Guardians of the Galaxy 2 humor, action , excitement and emotion throughout. Definitely a movie you see in the theatre,definitely should not be missed.",8,1,3,5 May 2017
Wonder Woman," A Beautiful,Thrilling Portrayal of this Icon! Most enjoyable!
","Last evening I saw Wonder Woman and it met and exceeded my expectations marvelously! Gal Gadot shines on screen as the Amazon Princess with an excellent supporting cast(The chemistry between her and co lead Chris Pine is wonderful!). You could very easily enjoy this film without seeing any of the previous films or will realize it as the best of it's franchise to date! Have no fear that this will be boring because of the period the film takes place in,it matters not. Creators of the film benefit greatly by staying true to the source material that has encapsulated audiences since Diana Prince's debut in comics over seven decades ago. As well as DC comic's own Geoff Johns joining the production team! Wonder Woman is done justice as she serves Justice by the amazing combat Sequences shot by Director Patty Jenkins and the score compliments the screen accordingly!I don't need humor in a film about a hero , nor do enjoy it when it's forced into a story. The humor in Wonder Woman is well placed and most called for and appreciated. The same goes for the action in this film it is not overdone nor is it to much or to little it is just right. . This movie benefits from an exciting story, heroic characters that are enjoyable and most credible vile villains. I want to see it again and can't wait to see Wonder Woman in Justice League this November!",9,165,388,2 June 2017
Alien: Covenant," The Big Nasty Xenomorph we fear and love is back and Fierce as ever!!
",I went to see Alien Covenant last night with a group of five and all of us left satisfied. Fans of the Alien franchise that did not enjoy Prometheus do not be dissuaded(I myself did not). Those that did like it will enjoy it as well. The story picks up the Prometheus story line and gives us what it was lacking. The Alien. You asked for it? You got it! The filmmakers rather than scrap the Prometheus story-line and reboot the successful franchise instead made a bold decision that in my opinion had a substantial payoff for the viewer. While the cast meets and exceeds expectations The real star of this movie is the Alien itself and while there is some necessary setup this film succeeds as it's predecessors did by crafting suspense for what we the viewer all know is coming and when it does in spite of what you saw in the trailers you are not ready. A little something for moralists as well as some horror film traditions are revisited and punishment is delved out to those with vices as well as the undeserving.I purchased the Alien anthology to refresh on the originals and I can say after seeing the 1979 original& 2003 Director's cut of the original Alien as well as Aliens this is a worthy companion and sheer delight for fans of the Alien franchise.This is definitely a film to see in theater's it is to big viewed on the big screen I personally shredded more than my usual share of popcorn from the second act on. Kick you're summer off right by visually getting you're ass kicked by this legendary horror of the big screen a truly terrifying Sci FI Horror Legend!,8,45,89,19 May 2017
