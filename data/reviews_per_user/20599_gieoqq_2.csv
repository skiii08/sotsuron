Saturday Night Fever," They Do Not make Them Like This Anymore
","Firstly, the music is great. It is a 'music' film but not making you feel repelled like Mamma Mia or whatever.The men are men and there is some action. Women are sexy and there is a skank in the backs eat. There is some fighting and fun and you are interested in the city and the locale.",8,9,10,2 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Illogical Positivity
","This was a boring film. The Mary Sue is still there being a Mary Sue and defying the rules of the force. They also shoehorn a forced relationship.People are free to like it of course, but I do not understand all the reviews saying JJ Abrams rescued Star Wars (is it his employees??) because JJ (and Disney) are the ones who damaged Star Wars in the first place!! So he is the rescuer now?? What he rescued it from himself??Still a subpar film.",2,151,190,2 January 2020
