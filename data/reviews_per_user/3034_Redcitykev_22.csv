Vertigo," Superb yes, but a masterpiece?
","For many years this film has been seen not only as the best Hitchcock film, but amongst the best American films of all. I have seen the film on many occasions, but have never really quite understood the fuss. tonight I watched a DVD of the restored version of the film and without doubt my opinion of it has changed. Maybe it is because I am older, seen more films, lived more life or whatever, but I now appreciate the psychological aspects of the film - obsession, manipulation, fear, love etc, and how Hitchcock's use of colour, deep focus, high angles etc etc are all used to superb effect to enhance the difference moods throughout the film.Having said all that the film still, for me, falls short of true greatness for a number of reasons. 1/ Just how does Scotty get down from the roof right at the very start of the film? 2/ What happens to the Barbara Bel-Geddis character - she just disappears once Scotty has been released from the hospital. 3/ Why (although the reason may be obvious) does Scotty not take Madeline to the hospital after she has been in the 'Fresco Bay instead of taking her to his apartment. 4/ When we see Madeline fall from the bell tower she is going feet first, yet when we learn the truth of what happened she is thrown off head first. Now, all these may be seen as myself being too 'picky', but such things do, for me, stop the film from crossing over from a superb piece of film making into a 100% solid gold masterpiece.One final thought. I watched the film via the restored version on DVD, and I have to say that the restoration is fantastic! Plus, on the region 2 version at least, there is an excellent 30 minute documentary on how the film was restore which is well worth watching.",8,1,3,29 May 2011
3:10 to Yuma," Superb use of close-ups, real feel of the old west
","In all great westerns it is the faces that tell the tale, and this excellent remake of the old classic is no exception. The close-ups in this movie are fantastic, and you really sense the pain these men have to endure in order to reach (or not, as the case may be!) their goals, both physical and metaphorical. My one great problem with this movie, and this is true of most westerns, is the role of the women, who are seen as classic examples of the Madonna/whore paradagm. This aside, the movie does capture the atmosphere of the west wonderfully well. You can feel the dust on you face, the snow falling on your clothing, and smell the smoky insides of the saloons. Also, my local cinema has a great sound system, so the shots really do whistle around your head. If it is a good, old fashioned shot 'em you are looking for, this is the movie for you!",8,2,5,2 October 2007
Casablanca," The Best American Film Ever?
","I have watched this film so many times that I thought I knew it inside out, back to front, top to bottom, etc. There is barely a line I can not quote when watching it, and I never tire of the relationships between Rick, Lisa, and the rest. I have wallowed in some of the finest performances ever captured on film, from Bogart's world weariness through to Claude Rains pragmatism, via the slimmy character of Peter Lorre and the largeness of Sydney Greenstreet. There is hardly a foot put wrong by any cast member, and the film is as near perfect as any film can possibly be.I used the term 'thought I knew it' above quite deliberately, because I was recently privilege to see a brand new digital print version of this classic movie. As the camera moved around the interior of Rick's Cafe American for the first time I thought something was wrong, the scene seemed 'foggy', then it clicked, what I was seeing was the smoke from the cigarettes! The print was so crisp and clear that it was like watching the film for the very first time. The exterior shots were incredibly bright, the dialogue clear and wonderfully full of crack and cackle, exactly as you would expect in a busy place as Casablanca! I have no need hear to go into the narrative, if you have seen the film you will know it backwards, and if you haven't, then why have you never watched this masterpiece? If you fear the digital age of cinema, fear not, if the digital version of this film, which I will always maintain is the best American film ever made, and amongst the best world wide, then I have seen the future, and it works!",10,1,3,23 November 2007
The Hunger Games," An American Battle Royale!
","In the future all wars have ended, but famine and poverty still remain in a new North Amercia, which has been split into 12 Districts. To appease the people, and pay tribute to the fallen, Capitol City have devised The Hunger Games, in which 2 children from each District are chosen to fight to the death live on TV.The film follows the fortunes of the two chosen from District 12, and we see them whisked off to Capitol City - a pastel coloured 'Willy Wonka' style place in which the people wear outlandish costumes, have bizarre haircuts and live seemingly empty and decedent lives. Here they are treated like royalty, and trained in readiness for the games.Eventually the children are pitted against each other and the game begin. It is here that the film begins to remind one of the Japanese classic of a few years back 'Battle Royale' - but without as much blood or violence. As the game progresses the rules begin to change to attain an ending which is pleasing to the masses, rather than those 'playing' the game, and new elements are thrown in to ensure excitement and 'fun' for the viewers.The film takes a long time to really hit its stride - the opening sequences seemingly go on forever - and there is no doubt that this film owes a big debt to 'Battle Royale', as well as nods to the original 'Rollerball' (in as much as war has been outlawed and violence has become controlled and organised for the entertainment of the masses) and even 'Logans Run', but it has enough in it to make it a stand-up, worthwhile film in its own right. Not the least of these is the way in which TV is shown to become cynical and exploitative, where - in much the same way as the Ancient Romans had their 'Blood and Circuses' - love and death are merely elements in mass entertainment.The production is very good - the future Capitol City looks amazing - whilst the acting ranges from excellent (the young actress playing the lead role is very good), to screen chewing (Woody Harrleson eats his heart out!!). The other thing about the film is its length - at almost 2hours 30minutes there is no doubt that it is just too long! A good half hour could have been lost without losing any of the tension or drama. Worth seeing definitely, but make sure you watch it in a comfortable cinema (or else take a cushion!)",8,78,106,26 March 2012
Juno," Mature View of American Teenagers - at last!
","When your average cinema going joe public think of films featuring American teenagers they tend to think of titles like the 'American Pie' series of gross-out comedies, or the endless stream of slasher movies that seem to pollute the screens and DVD shelves these days (don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good slasher movie once in a while, but there are just so many of the about lately!) What they would not think of is a film like 'Juno' that, for possibly the first time since the early Linklater movies, deal with Amercian teenagers in a really mature, intelligent manner.What I really like about this movie is that is does not set out for belly laughs by presenting us with gross-out comedy, but instead allows the comedy to grow naturally out of the situations presented, and by the naturalistic acting of the main characters. As Juno Ellen Page is outstanding, a possible star in the making. She is backed up by a near flawless supporting cast, with Micheal Cera being the stand out as the confused, upset, but ever loyal Bleeker. The scene in the hospital, with the two on the bed, was very moving without ever being sentimental.A few last thoughts. The opening title sequence is magnificent, why can't more movies put more effort into great open title sequences? Then there is the music. The audience I watched the film with were mainly OAP's (it was a local matinée!), so the choice of music went over many of their heads, but I was secretly bopping along in my seat to some fantastic tunes. It was really interesting that Juno was given such taste in music, rather than what you would expect from a teenager in contemporary USA - or this a dig at the current state of music on that side of the pond? Despite the controversy of the issues raised - although personally I believe pro-choice also gives a women the right to have her baby - I believe that this is an ideal film to enhance your faith in both mankind and in intelligent film making",10,1,4,13 March 2008
Cloverfield," Not a bad film, but...
","Whilst this film is not exactly bad, I can not say it is particularly good either. The main reason for this I thought that it was full of plot holes and obvious events, as well as making me feel decidedly sea-sick! Part of the film's problem is the fact that it took so long to get going. For a film as short as this the opening party scene seemed to go on for hours, and was the kind of party that I would personally have avoided like the plague! In fact by the time the action actually got going I was already wishing for most of the party goers to 'bite the dust'! When eventually the film did get into its stride the comparisons with 9/11 were so blindly obvious to be quite painful. The falling building, the rubble and dust rolling down the street etc could not have existed before that dreadful day and the subsequent TV coverage. Following on from this the film really became not much more than a chase movie, with a lot of running - and I mean A LOT OF RUNNING! - about, plenty of screams and some really dumb actions by the characters.The most puzzling part of the film for myself was when the surviving lead characters went into the subway system. Now surely, with New York being attacked in the manor it was, this system would have been heaving with like-minded souls attempting to escape from the happenings on the surface? Yet when they got down there they were the only ones. As for what happens down there, well I would spoil it for those who have not viewed the film yet, but to say they were obvious is like saying Manchester United play in red at home! The few things that save this film from being a complete duffer is the special effects. The monster, which is only slowly revealed, is really quite scary, and the destruction is well done. The action, when it gets going, is fast and furious, and the acting, whilst never being Oscar worthy!, is not bad for a film of this type.Of course I am sure that there is a whole essay to be written about this film - and others like the recent 'Invasion', 'I am Legend' etc - and the whole post 9/11 scenario, but I will leave that to much more learned minds than my own! Surfice to say that if you are willing to leave your brain at the box office, and can cope with the opening party scene full of horrid little people, then this film offers up a reasonable amount of entertainment.",6,1,3,28 February 2008
The Adventures of Tintin," Visually Interesting but...
","First up I have to admit that as a kid I was never a big fan of Tintin - he was always that strange kid in a comic book from some other place! - so, with no great expectations regarding this film, I approached it with an open mind.What I discovered was a film that, although visually very interesting, seemed confused and muddled. First off Tintin is, as I understand it, a Belgian boy reporter, so why were all the characters in the early market scene talking in mock cockney al-la Dick Van Dyke and doing deals in pound stirling and why were all the big houses seemingly a mix of North European Chateaux and English Country Houses? Next the story line starts off with an interesting premise - a mystery hidden within a model ship - but soon descends into a flimsy excuse for dashing from one big set piece to another - including a totally bewildering sequence in Morroco with tanks and bazookas etc (were these left over from the war, or is the story line set during WWII? If the later then where were the Nazis? etc), and by the time any real conclusion is reached I felt so exhausted by all the chases, explosions, pirates, opera singers who can shatter glass (like I didn't see that one coming from a mile away!) etc I no longer really cared! And of course there was the now obligatory open end allowing for the inevitable follow up! What so disappointed me about the film was the fact that this came from Spielberg, a past master at such fast paced adventure films. It seemed that he was not certain himself as to which film he was making - an animated version of a world-wide classic series of books or an animated version of Indianna Jones? There were odd little clues littering the film (a tail of a crashed plane in the dessert with a swastika on it, the aforementioned tanks etc) that seemed to suggest the later but the whole enterprise became so muddled that I guess in the end it didn't really matter.Finally, for all the marvels of the animation this was, for me, a film without soul. The character of Tintin was just a cipher (as I believe he is in the books), Haddock was just a buffoon, the Thompson Twins plan silly and the other characters utterly forgettable! The only character I came away really like was Snowy the dog! For all the hype this is basically, like this years version of The Three Musketeers, a film that may keep the youngster quiet for a couple of hours, but one that made me feel like 'ok, watchable but so what'!",Null,19,28,16 November 2011
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," And so it ends...
","Way back in early 1978 I joined hundreds of other film fans queuing around the block to get into the Bristol Odeon (pre multi-screen) to experience a totally new cinematic event. Star Wars IV A New Hope had arrived to blow us all away - and it did, boy it did!Almost exactly 41 years later my elder self walked into a near empty (bar 5 other people) at the Bristol Showcase to see the end of a saga which had taken us to new worlds, that had killed off old characters and introduced us to new ones, and had us ride a rollercoaster of emotions. So, did this final instalment live up to my hopes after all these years? I have to say, on balance, that yes, with a few reservations, it did.The way the old guard said goodbye - that is to say Hans Solo, Leia, and, of course, Luke Skywalker (the original triumvirate of Harrison Ford, Mark Hammill and, most poignantly of them all, the late (and great) Carrie Fisher was most moving - appearing as ghostly figures throughout (after Leia had departed for the universe of the Force) and guided the new crew of Rey, Finn and Poe (Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Oscar Isaac) through the final battle of good vs evil - was nicely handled, and the various revelations around Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and Rey were, for the most part, quite surprising.My reservations were mainly that some of the chase and battle sequences - especially at the start - went on too long and did not really add much to the narrative, and the subplot involving Chewbacca seemed a little lacklustre. But in the end the loose ends appeared to be all tied up, and the rebels finally found their cause!So, farewell to 41 years of entertainment on an epic scale (allowances made for parts I-III!), farewell to C3PO and R2D2, to the Ewoks, the good guys in white and the bad guys in black, and, most of all, to the original three who brought so much to my teenage and early 20s!",8,4,15,7 January 2020
Gone Baby Gone," Child snatching leads into the underbelly of American life
","From the simple basis of a child going missing from her bedroom - with its terrible overtones of the Maddy McCann and Sharron Mathews cases in Britain (completely unintended as the film was made a good year before those cases hit the headlines) - we are taken on a downward spiral into the underbelly of the American Dream. This is a world where, to quote Patrick Kenzie (Casey Afflick), the people were born in the cracks and then fall through them.Drug dealing, alcoholism, abuse, corruption are all encountered as Kenzie and his assistant Angie Gennaro (the underused Michelle Monaghan) 'assist' the Boston police in their search for young Amanda Mcready. The characters are all, with barely an expectation, the dregs of the earth, and show little, if any, concern for the missing girl, especially when their own interests become threatened. As the plot unravels, and quite a complex one it is too, we begin to realise that this is a film with little hope, either for the missing girl - and a poor young boy who also becomes a victim of the depraved nature of some of the characters - or anyone else caught up in the case.At the heart of the film lies a moral question - is it right to commit a crime which society finds heinous for what may be the right reasons? It is to the credit of the intelligence of the film that this question is not answered with any easy options, instead it is us that are left to consider our own response to this dilemma.As one might expect from a film of this quality the performances are universally excellent, from Casey Afflick (building on the promise he showed in 'The Assissin of Jessie James by the coward Robert Ford'), to the ever reliable Morgan Freeman. But the outstanding performance comes from Amy Ryan as the missing girls' mother, a disgusting slice of humanity, who cares more for her drinking, drugs and men than her daughter, who she uses on drugs trips etc. The final scene further emphasises the uncaring nature of the character, and further questions our response to the central moral question.The direction is also excellent, and you would never guess if you did not already know that this film is a first effort from Ben Afflick. This shows great promise, and it is just possible that American cinema has found another actor/director in the mould of Eastwood and Penn.This film is never an easy watch, and you will not leave the cinema full of the joys of spring, but it will give you an insight into a part of America that normally remains hidden from view",8,0,0,24 June 2008
Control," Caught the atmosphere wonderfully
","Speaking as someone 'who was there' - ie a teenage/young man in the late 1970's/early 1980's - the first thing that struck me about this film was the way in which it captured the atmosphere of that age. Dank, grim and often feeling bereft of hope for the future. Into this dark world stormed music which attempted to capture the zeitgeist of the age, groups like the Sex Pistol, The Damned, The Clash etc, and, above all of these to my mind, Joy Division and their strange, troubled looking lead singer Ian Curtis.In trying to capture the essence of Ian and the band onto film is no easy feat, and director Alan Corbijn has almost pulled it off completely. The dissolution of the times, the soul destroying high rise blocks, grubby clubs (many a night spent in such places!) and a society on the verge of Thatcherism is wonderfully portrayed, and use of music, going from the glam of Bowie to the 'in your face' Pistols creates the atmosphere of society on the turn.It is clever in the way that Corbijn only shows the reaction to other groups - ie like when Ian and Deborah are watching Bowie as Ziggy Stardust, or the lads - ie Hooky et al - are transfixed by the Pistols. This is repeated when Tony Wilson watches Joy Division for the first time, his reaction is splendid! This allows for the performances by Joy Division themselves to take centre stage, and when they do, WOW! Corbijn captures the live experience in a way that is almost Scoreses/Raging Bull in its intensity.Needless to say the cast are all fine, with Ms Morton again giving an object lesson in portraying tortured females on the screen - ie 'Longford' and herself as Maria Hindly. But of course, as with anything connected to Joy Division, it is Curtis we have come to watch, and Sam Riley delivers a once-in-a-lifetime performance as Ian. If he does anything better then I REALLY want to watch it! Yes the film is bleak, it was a bleak era, and the humour could be lost on those who were not there - it is typically British Northern, and, speaking as a Southerner, I did find it a little hard to take - but the film does give an insight into a tortured soul without ever being sentimental or cruel.If the film has a fault it is that it is, maybe, a little too long - 10 minutes could have easily been trimmed, and it is at times a little too bleak, but it is rewarding if you were there, the memories will come flooding back, believe me!, and if you were not, then it shows you what you missed out on!",8,5,8,15 January 2008
Quantum of Solace," Maybe not the best Bond, but it sure beats Octopussy & Moonraker!
","I picked a horrid, wet English Thursday afternoon to catch the latest Bond movie in my local cinema, and, whilst not maybe being the best Bond movie of all time it was certainly entertaining enough to brighten up the nasty old afternoon that was going on outside! At first I was a little put off by the start - no familiar figure firing a shot into the camera lens - but it soon become clear that what we were watching was the immediate continuation from Casino Royale. Here I found myself praising the director and writers for treating us with respect, no 10 précis of what happening in the earlier film, they knew its core audience would be au fait enough to be up-to-speed with events, and soon we were into the excellent title sequence (and, yes, I like the song!), then - WHAM!- the action begins.The action sequences are, as one might expect from a Bond movie, outstanding, although I felt that one or two of them went on for a little too long - even Bond needs to pause for breath once in a while! As for the story line, I found that a little on the weak and often muddled side - I thought that maybe the revenge mission Bond had set for himself occasionally got in the way of the main story line of destabilising a country for its oil, or not as the case maybe. The villains here did not seem as evil as say Blofeld, and the mystery organisation certainly could never touch SMERSH for pure nastiness! That said the story did keep the movie going at a real pace, and the relatively short running time (for a Bond film at least) whipped by.One thing I did find fun was spotting the inter Bond references - the most obvious one being, of course, Goldfinger (here more like Oilfinger!) Others, like Live and Let Die (the coffins in Port Au Prince - yes, yes, I know the 'funeral' in Live and Let Die took place in New Orleans, but what the hey!), the Diamonds Are Forever with the lift fight, and a couple of others that escape me at the moment! This may not be a Bond to rate with the true greats of the series like Goldfinger, From Russia With Love or, dare I say it, Casino Royale, but it is certainly much better than the Bond of dross like Octopussy or Moonraker. Personally I would place this Bond alongside those enjoyable, if sightly forgettable, ones like Live and Let Die, On Her Majesty's Secret Service (the most underrated Bond) and Diamonds Are Forever.A final point, a friend of mine hadn't been to see a Bond movie since the early 1980's and was waiting all film for THAT famous line 'The name's Bond...', but... Hey, maybe next outing for Britain's finest!",7,2,6,13 November 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Stunning photography raises this to the level of a near classic
","Over the past few weeks I have viewed a number of films that contain some stunning sequences and photography, most notably 'No Country For Old Men' and 'There Will Be Blood' (the opening twenty minutes of which is film-making at its peak). Amongst these is this film, a eulogy to a past way of life and a lament for the passing of heroes.Near the beginning of this film there is a night-time train robbery, and of all the sequences and photography throughout the rest of the film it is this that has lingered longest in my mind. The use of the lights from the lamps of the outlaws in the dark woods gives the sequence a sinister edge, an edge that is built upon as the train comes around the bend in the tracks, its headlights catching the hooded figures of the outlaws in its beam, making them look like ghosts. As the train approaches the tree trunks and other large wooden items laid on the tracks, upon which Jesse James himself stands, the camera is pointed right at the cattle-catch. This is not only a frightening sight, but also a direct reference to one of the earliest films of a train arriving at a station (Lumiere Brothers 1895). This fear is increased when the train than actually starts to push the camera along, giving the impression that the train is roaring into the cinema! Once this sequence is over the film settles down into its stride, very stately and, at times, painfully slow. This is not to detract from the film, these slow periods are needed, I believe, in order to emphasise the pasting of an age that was first coming to an end during the time in which the film is set. All the faces - and what faces they are! - show a world-weariness and ageing that comes from living a life of such hardness, and the constant hiding from both the law and Jesse himself - who is also on the run from his own past - all serve to reinforce the notion of a life without reward. The performances are universally excellent, Brad Pitt is superb as Jesse, and Casey Affleck is all slime and charm as Robert Ford.The final sequences, in which Robert Ford plays upon his new found fame, coupled with his own earlier worshipping of Jesse James as a legendary figure, prove that even then the cult of celebrity was something to be weary off.If the film has a fault it is that it is about 20 minutes too long, a little bit of trimming here and there could have easily been carried out without losing the force of its emotional or philosophical appeal.",8,3,6,8 April 2008
2012," Dreadful!
","I could easily spend all of my alloted 1,000 words describing just how bad this film is, but what would be the point? Surfice to say that this must rank as amongst the worst films I have ever sat through - and, yes, I did manage the whole 2 hours 30 minutes, unlike some in the cinema! Everything in this pile of utter rubbish is predictable - who is going to die, who survives, what happens to the horrid little dog etc - if you haven't worked it out within half and hour of the start of the film then you simply haven't seen many films! So, why did I waste an afternoon watch this waste of film stock? Simple, I have a mate who, being a veteran of the industry, has a free pass for most cinemas so we did not pay - the only plus point of the whole event! To quote Monty Python, this is not a film for lying down, this is a film for lying down and avoiding! Utter, total tosh from first to last. If the end of the world means that films like this no longer gets made then bring it on!",1,10,15,24 November 2009
Stardust," Excellent piece of entertainment
","I doubt that there are many people who would place Stardust at the top of their lists of the best films of 2007, but there is little doubting that this film is, if you are in the right mood, an excellent piece of entertainment.The concept of a magical land sited right next to a little area of jolly old England is a nice one, especially as the portal is a simple dry built stone wall, the type that you see throughout the English countryside! The time setting is very interesting, I first thought that the story would have worked better if the English setting was modern era, but on reflection a modern day youth of 16 would be too 'streetwise' to be drawn into the world beyond the wall. Withing this setting the narrative holds no real surprises, and without giving anything away the moral line of Good vs Evil and True Love triumphing - or not as the case may be - is all to familiar to anyone who has any grounding in basic faery tales and fantasy fiction.Allowing for the constraints that the basic storyline gives the film, the film does allow its own elements to breath, and there are no strings left untied that I could see.The performances are all great fun, and all cast members seem to be really enjoying themselves, although there is one 'turn' that steels the show. Mr DeNero is truly a joy to behold! At first he appears to be playing, well DeNero, but then...No, I'm not going to say any more, you will just have to see the film to judge for yourselves! The effects are what you expect from such a film, all very well done, and some are really spectacular. There is nothing here to really disappoint all but the most critical fantasy film fans, and for the causal viewer there is a lot of fun to be had here.Check your brain in at the box office, get yourself a large popcorn and sit back and let this film entertain you for a couple of hours. You may have forgotten most of it by the time you reach the pub - apart for the aforementioned Mr DeNero! - but you would not have wasted your money!",8,6,9,22 November 2007
I Am Legend," OK, but that ending...!
","This modern day remake of 'The Omega Man' (itself a remake of an earlier film 'The Last Man On Earth') is, for the most part, a typical slice of Hollywood nonsense, but it does suffer greatly from possibly the worst ending I have seen in a major Hollywood film for a long - more about that later, and if you don't want to know about it I suggest you stop reading this comment now! Will Smith is perfectly fine in the Charlton Heston role of the last man alive in New York after a cure for cancer had mutated into a nasty little virus - I think it was LA in Heston's version - although there are times when he is upstaged by the dog, Sam, one of the best animal performances on film for a long time! The empty streets of Manhatten are well achieved, as is the initial panic in the flashback scenes. The Dark Seekers are very menacing, and there are a few early scary scenes involving them. I also found the symbolism running throughout the film interesting, the eternal hunt for survival by man, animal and 'other', the symbolic butterfly - seen both in the park when Sam the Dog watches puzzled as one flutters by her nose, and in the tattoo on Anna's neck. Of course the most obvious is that of day and night, dark and light etc, ie all good things happened in the light/day, whilst night/dark is seen as evil, all very Christian! For me the film begins to unravel when Anna and her child arrive on the scene. Suddenly one man's fight for survival and loneliness are replaced by a desire to reach a near mythological place of freedom - a none-too-subtle analogy of America pre-9/11 itself, which of course this film is. From being this interesting study of all the above the film becomes no more than just another chase movie ala 'The Invasion'. Also, there is no real explanation for the Will Smith's character's immunity to the virus, just why was he immune to it? This brings me to the ending...WARNING - BIG ENDING SPOILER COMING UP (DO NOT READ ON IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM AND DO NOT WANT TO KNOW HOW IT ENDS) After all the sacrifices and surviving all the creatures of the night Anna and her child eventually arrive at the place of safety, and, guess what, it is some idealised version of White Picket Fence America, with a White Board Church, Sundrenched Roads, and, naturally, a HUGE American flag fluttering lightly in the breeze. All this surrounded by a massive wall and armed guards, all very symbolic of an America which has defeated all before and is rebuilding itself in an image of a rose-coloured past! Sorry, but considering that the whole world had been affected by the virus surely the place of safety would be something along the lines of the UN, not some sanitised version of an America which had lead to the birth of the virus in the first place. No I did not buy this ending at all, in fact it all but spoilt what had been, up to that point, an enjoyable bit of entertainment.",5,1,2,31 January 2008
Clash of the Titans," Pretentious, ott, but I loved it!
","Once in a while a film comes along that should be avoided at all costs - a film that you know as soon as you pay your money at the box office is going to be a 'leave your brain at the door' type affair, yet you venture into the auditorium and watch it anyway. Such a film is this, full of portentous - and pretentious - lines about the hubris of mankind when they reject their Gods, lots of oh-so predictable daring do, lashing of CGI monsters etc, and yet I loved every single minute of it! Why? Maybe it was the mood I was in, just right for a bit of pure escapism with no great, deep hidden meaning (I had watched the wonderful 'A Prophet' on the Sunday, a film with so many layers my head is still trying to get itself around it!), or maybe it was simply that I got carried away with the daring-do of it all.To say that this is a film that lacks any originality is like saying Manchester United is a well known football team! Everything you would expect from such a film is here - mainly stuff that will be familiar to any fan of the 1981 version. Persius saved from his watery grave, Zeus and Hades angry with mankind for rejecting them, the prophet begging the citizens of Argos to sacrifice their Princess, Andromina, lots of fighting with big - and I mean BIG! - scorpions, the death of Medusa, and the ultimate battle with the Karken all nicely ticked off. The effects are, as one has come to expect from a big Hollywood movie, are all very good (I saw the 2D version, so in 3D I would imagine them to be even better) - and shows just how far this kind of movie has come from the days of the great Harry Harryhausen etc.If you should desire to watch this film do not expect much in the way of depth, or even great acting (all pretty wooden if truth be told), but do switch off your brain and just let it happen!",5,1,2,21 April 2010
Avatar," Fantastic special effects, but...
","Finally, as one of the seemingly few remaining human beings not to have seen Avatar yet, I had an invite to join 3 fellow film fans (two of whom had already seen the film) to visit our nearest multiplex showing the film in 3D, an invite not to be turned down.So finally having experienced the most financially successful film of all time what was my opinion. Well, there is no denying that the special effects are quite amazing - this is a film that has to been seen in 3D, I just could not imagine it 'flat - yet as for the story line I could not help but think I had seen it all before.During the journey home I mulled the story over in my mind and pieced it together thus - you take a little '2001 A Space Odyssey', throw in a dash of 'First Blood - Rambo', add a dollop of 'Last of the Mohecians', mix just about 'boy meets girl, boy loses girls, boy and girl get together in the end', and finally stir with a splash of almost all the recent eco-porn movies and thus you have 'Avatar'. Don't get me wrong, this does not mean the film doesn't have merit - it moves at a nice pace, the action sequences are superb, the characters display some real depth and as a whole it is very watchable, but just do not expect anything really original or totally mindblowing.If you have not experienced this film yet do so, you will enjoy it even if only on a basic level, but I do urge you to check out the 3D version where the effects come to life, and avoid the standard version.",8,1,3,28 January 2010
The Lion King," Excellent use of 3D effects
","Being of a certain age, and without children, this is one of the classic Disney films I have never seen, but the opportunity arose to finally getting around to watching it when my mother, who is into her 80's and disabled, said she would love to see it. With the help of a very good friend, a veteran of the industry, we went to one of Bristol's (England) out-of-town multi-plexes and, for the grand total of £0.00 (or, if you like, $0.00!!!), sat back and waited for the fun to begin! The film is big, brash, colourful, and total predicable of course. Rightful pretender to the throne is framed by nasty old Scar, leaves, meets good friends, is persuaded to return, fights nasty old Scar, and Simba takes up his rightful place as King of the Pride. All very Disney, very good triumphing over evil, good guys getting their rightful dues, baddies getting their due comeuppance etc. What raises this above the level of most other animated films of this kind is the quality of the animation - quite superb - some great characters (the farting Warthog is fantastic, Scar suitably nasty, Simba proud and upright, etc), and some excellent songs - Circle of Life has, of course, become a children's classic song! The version I took my mother to see was the newly released 3D one, and I have to say that I was very impressed with how Disney had turned a 2D film into a film with great depth and scope. It did not always work as well as it could have, some scenes still looked a little flat, but certainly when the birds were flying overhead, or the camera was swooping down onto different characters, then the effects were excellent, and really added to the enjoyment of the film.If you have yet to catch up with this film then I would highly recommend you go and watch the 3D version - it is very well done, and worth the admission price - unless you are like myself and know the right people to gain free admission!!!",8,1,2,19 October 2011
Sherlock Holmes," A Sherlock Holmes to watch whilst waiting for the new Bond!
","So, what do we do whilst we are waiting for the next James Bond film to come along? Well, here's one suggestion, go watch the new version of Sherlock Holmes! This Sherlock certainly has all the elements you would expect of Holmes - the pipe, poor violin playing, untidy quarters, a methodical mind, and, of course, his reliable side kick Watson. But what makes this Sherlock stand out is the way in which he goes about his job - here chasing after a mysterious figure (a wonderful Mark Strong creation) who may, or may not, be using the dark arts to bring down the world order - is the fact that he throws himself (and Watson, LeStrade and just about everyone else who happens to be at hand) into his work ala Mr Bond - all fast action, shot-em ups and near misses - all neatly wrapped up at the end with all the good guys living happy ever after! Does this approach work - well, yes! And it does so mainly because of the way both Robert Downey Jnr and Jude Law look like they are really having fun - as do all the females (especially Rachel McAdams). The film rattles along at a cracking pace, and any holes in the plot are nice smoothed out with some clever 'wrapping up' at the end. Also the atmosphere of Olde London Town is nicely done - all fog and mist, muck and horses etc.If you like your Holmes fast paced and full of action then this is the Holmes for you - if not, go along and you still might enjoy the difference.",8,0,0,28 January 2010
The Woman in Black," Hammer back doing what they do best!
","As a kid growing up in the UK the Independent TV sector was split into regions, with HTV being the regional channel where I lived. Each region had a good deal of control over their own programming, and Monday nights were always film nights in the HTV region. As these were relatively late night showings (around 10:30pm) these films were almost always horror films, which meant either classic Universal, American International Pictures or, of course, Hammer Horrors. It was the Hammer films that I enjoyed most - Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Ingrid Pitt etc etc, so it was sad to see the studio go into such decline. But now with this wonderfully atmospheric haunted house story (plus the remake of Let The Right One In, and one other whose title has escaped me for the moment) the studio - or at least the company that has taken over the legendary name - is back to doing what it does best, scaring the life out of film goers the world over!! This film has all the hallmarks of a classic Hammer film, the old village full of unwelcoming locals, the local pub with an even more unwelcoming feel ('We're packed to the rafters all week' - even if Kipps is the only guest to be seen!), the bleak landscape, and, of course, the wonderful old house (usually on top a hill, but in this case on an island that gets cut-off from the mainland by the incoming tide twice a day).Into this arrives the aforementioned Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe in his first big post Harry Potter role), looking into the estate of the late owner of the old house. As he looks into the papers etc he finds more than he bargained for, and then the 'fun' really begins as the ghost of the title character starts to weave her evil presence over the proceedings.As the mystery over the Lady In Black begins to unravel the atmosphere builds and the shocks come fast - although not so fast that you don't have time to catch your breath between screams! Daniel Radcliffe handles his role very well (and shows a lot of promise for a good post Harry career), and the supporting cast - full of good old British character actors like Ciaran Hinds, all play their parts to the full.The ending has been described as 'Hollywood', but personally I felt it fitted in well and showed a certain amount of redemption (impossible to fully explain without giving the ending away, which I do not want to do here).This is not your blood and guts type horror, rather one based on character, story line and atmosphere, and is well worth a visit if you like being scared out of your seat! Whilst this may not be the Hammer of Bray Studios etc, it is good to see the name back emblazoned on the big screen again, and doing what Hammer do best... BOO!",8,8,13,8 March 2012
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Very enjoyable, but where was Drake?
","I am no scholar of the Elizabethan era, so I can not comment on the historical accuracy of this enjoyable costume drama, but I am sure that the figure of Sir Francis Drake played a larger part in the decisive battle against the Spanish Armarda than appeared to be the case here. The only sight you have of him is on board ship, and then you only realise it is him when Sir Walter Raleigh mentions his name! I know that was not the main emotional point of the film, and I do appreciate that Raleigh and Elizabeth had a very close, intense relationship, but surely one of England's most crucial sea victories should at least feature with one of its major players having a larger role.Now I've got that off my chest, on with the review. The film is splendidly mounted, and looks great - it was a pity that the print that my local had was very scratched in places. The acting is, as one would expect from such a prestigious production, uniformly excellent, with Blanchett again showing amazing emotional range. Geoffery Rush is also very good, and Clive Owen has great presence as Raleigh.The fact that the film concentrates mainly on the relationships between the main characters allows us to see Elizabeth as a human being with all the faults and passions that brings with it, rather than someone above the humanity around her. Having said that there was a couple of times when the lighting was used to make her look like a Saint, notably when she 'survives' the assassin attempt on her.The politics of the era were, naturally, somewhat simplified - I am sure the politics of the time were as complicated and complex as ours today - but this did not matter, and served to increase the dramatic tensions on the screen.Whether or not this is as good as the first film starring Ms Blanchett in the role I can not say as it seems a life time ago I saw that film, but in its own right it is well worth the admission fee, even if it is not entirely historically accurate.",8,3,4,27 November 2007
Atonement," 'Down from the Hill film' that is finally worth watching
","In my home town we have a phase for films like Atonement, and that is 'Down from the Hill'. This refers to those predominately middle class folk who come down from the top-end of town to make their 1 or 2 annual visits to our local cinema, and always to watch films like this. Past films that have fallen into this category have included such worthy, but rather dull films, as 'The English Patient', 'Gosford Park', 'Pride and Predudice' etc - ie those films that tend to fall into the 'English Heritage' mode of film making. This year's movie to satisfy their need is Atonement, but for once this is a film that, to my mind, is actually very good.The film is very cleverly structured, and this adds to the understanding of why certain decisions by certain people are taken, leading to a train of events which pull you, the viewer, along to a quite superb ending - which I have no intention of giving away here! Needless to say the acting is uniformly excellent, especially from the younger members of the cast. The psychological side of the film is also wonderfully handled, and I felt genuinely moved by what I saw on the screen.I feel sure that this film will do well at the Oscars - not that I pay any attention to any awards! - and for once it is a film that deserves all the praise it is getting.",6,2,5,9 October 2007
