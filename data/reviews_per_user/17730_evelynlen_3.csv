Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It rewrote the lightsabre dual!!
","Well, I know that people say that is the weakest of all the Star Wars movies and I tend to agree with them because they will never be able to beat the originals, they are classics. However I still think that it was a great movie and a real treat for avid Star Wars fans. The story line is a little hard to follow at first but on the whole I think that it was a well written movie. The films greatest weakness is JarJar Binks. I found him to be extremely annoying and he was a poor substitute for Chewie as a lovable charactor for kids. The films greatest assets were the lightsabre duals between Darth Maul, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui Gon Jinn. I was on the edge of my seat throughout all of the sabre battles. I also enjoyed the seeing the Jedi council because they added more myth and curiosity to the Jedi. I think that George Lucas did a great job with Episode One and he has set up all the Star Wars fans out there for a great installment with Episode Two which I can't wait for!",10,0,1,1 April 2000
10 Things I Hate About You," The best teen flick ever made.
",This is the best teen flick that has been made in my opinion. The first time I saw it I was crying with laughter. The humour is not just for teenagers/young adults but for anyone who enjoys a laugh. There are good performances from all the cast in particular the two leading roles. I think that it is great way to introduce young people to the brilliance of Shakespeare.,10,0,0,28 March 2000
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The best movie I have ever seen.
","I think that it is the best movie out of the trilogy and it is the best movie I have ever seen. All of the main actors are excellent in their roles and it is the movie that expands each of the charactors. The plot is well structured and leaves you  wanting more, I enjoy it every time I see it.My favourite scene in the movie and a great movie moment in history is the part when Yoda raises the X-wing out of the waters on Dagobah. That scene captures the true power and nature of the Force.",10,1,2,12 March 2000
