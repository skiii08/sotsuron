Black Swan," When the last picture started fading...
","...i caught my hands still shaking and myself wanting to stand up and start clapping. some people were giggling and I was furious inside because I thought it was so disrespectful.Black Swan is one of the best films I've ever seen. The directing was impetuous, artful, powerful. Natalie Portman was just BREATH-TAKING. I'm still in AWE. Seriously. Her performance was almost unreal. I think it's safe to say it was the best acting by a female I have ever witnessed. All in all the movie is a work of art. It would be an insult not to go watch it on the big screen.Even if some scenes were a bit over the top, maybe there were just few horror elements too much included for my taste...oh yeah and the startling explicit bedroom-scene after the clubbing... it still remains a definite 10 out of 10 and a must watch for anybody claiming to be a connoisseur of cinema! thank you for your attention.",10,1,3,19 January 2011
