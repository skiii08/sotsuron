Source Code," an intelligent and interesting movie...though my expectations were much higher...
","Duncan Jones' sophomore directorial effort after the sublime Moon further proves he has a knack for intelligent, emotion-filled sci-fi's. Source Code is one of those movies which make you think and really make you realize that unlike some filmmakers there are some intelligent and creative brains out there who still believe in quality cinema. In a nutshell, the movie is a Sci-Fi action thriller and is brilliantly shot. I said brilliant because of three reasons:-1.The way of storytelling. 2.The visibility of the scenes, dialogs and the overall script. 3.The quality of the direction.The technical aspects of the movie are not too hard to understand and you are always captivated and captured by the somewhat volatile happenings. The action in the movie is first-rate and does provide the buzz expected of an action thriller.Here you follow the main character. When the movie starts, you know just as much of what's going on as our main character does: Nothing. The movie starts out with a man (Jake Gyllenhaal) waking on a train not knowing where he is. The girl in front of him is Christina (Michelle Monaghan) and she thinks she knows him, even when he insists that he is actually an army pilot named Colter. Going into the bathroom he checks his appearance and sees that he has someone else's face. When the train explodes Colter awakens inside a freezing cold container. He's addressed on a computer screen by Colleen (Vera Farmiga), a military captain who explains that he is part of a program called Source Code. It's administered by Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) and allows a person to inject themselves into someone else's body to relive the last eight minutes of their life. It is said not to affect the past but to address the future. As such, Colter's mission is to go back in time and find out who has placed a bomb on the train so that the bomber can be identified and stopped from setting off a second explosive in the city.The Story reveals itself in a rapid pace from the beginning to the end. It is a thriller that values its heart and its mind more than velocity or adrenaline. Working in the action genre, it's a more accessible film than Duncan Jones' leisurely paced sci-fi debut Moon. But with a solid screenplay from Ben Ripley the depth and the intelligence have not been forgotten. This is a highly economical film, working in just a few locations and moving vigorously over its lean ninety minutes. Jones is concerned foremost about the misuse of technology but equally the paranoia that terrorism imposes on ordinary people: an intelligent and timely theme, which surprisingly gives way to brief moments of humour. The human responses from the passengers as Colter interrogates them, turning their bags inside out, are quietly funny. Even more fascinating is the way the film touches on how racial assumptions are born from paranoia, like when Colter stalks a man of Indian appearance. These are issues visualised with intensity and originality. There are a couple scenes of gorgeously shot, tear-jerkingly beautiful brilliance. That, and the cinematography is worth noting- It is very slick and tone- setting.The acting is fantastic by everybody. Gyllenhaal is in this movie for nearly every frame and he's great in every scene. He proves he can stand his ground as a lead in an action feature. He succeeds in this role, where other actors may have failed. Gyllenhaal had the perfect persona for this role. He's got a forceful attitude with a sympathetic face. Michelle Monaghan has this innocent charm with her character. Vera Farmiga and the very underrated Jeffrey Wright give very interesting and complex performances as well.Despite all the positive comments above, I was a bit disappointed. The movie, performances, cinematography, script everything is great. It's just, I had a enormously huge expectation from this, which was a mistake. I wanted to feel the same way when I felt after watching Inception, which did not happen.I give it 7 for being a deeply enjoyable experience, although it should be noted that considering what was said above, it isn't revolutionary.",7,0,1,15 June 2011
Shaun of the Dead," Best horror-comedy I've ever seen...
","Shaun's nearing 30, stuck in a crappy sales job, and his girlfriend Liz is unhappy with the amount of time he spends with his ultra-slacker B- class drug dealer friend, Ed, at their local pub, the Winchester. When Liz dumps him, Shaun's so glum he doesn't even realise that London's been overrun with flesh-eating zombies. But somewhere within his console-happy lazy self, a hero is born.British humor, how I love it! 'Shaun Of The Dead' is full of it. For everyone to know, this isn't a simple spoof of Dawn Of The Dead(as the name implies) , it's more a romantic comedy that just so happens to be littered with the Zombies(or zom-rom-com) a self-proclaimed new genre, who appear for no good clear reason (although some tantalizing clues are offered). Let me make clear right at the beginning that you don't need to be a horror fan to enjoy it. You just need to have the right sense of humour. This is a mixture of almost every genre you can imagine. There's a little bit of drama, a little bit of romance, some horror and, as I said, LOTS of humor! spiced with the references to every zombie flick ever made. The movie is clever, witty, sweet and nasty and, at times, gory and horrific. The film is an amazing blend of the funny, the violent and the poignant. 'Shaun of the Dead' has some great comical moments and yet it has been made with lots of professionalism like this was a serious gory horror movie they were making. Because of this, through its seriousness, the movie becomes perhaps even more hilarious and really delivers. Both the fans of the (British) comedy-genre and the fans of mainly 'Zombie' movies and other gory horror-movies, will be entertained by this movie.The script is wonderful and throws up many comedic moments, such as my favorite, the old record collection that Shaun (Simon Pegg) and ED (Nick Frost) insanely used to throw at two oncoming zombies, and at the same time, the methodical and selective process of which albums they wanted to throw and which they wanted to keep! 'Dire Straits?' 'Chuck it!', or when Shaun and his friends beat up an elderly zombie in the pub using cricket bats, all to the rhythm of Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. I can't even begin to emphasise how cool this British film is. The amount of time it takes for Shaun and Ed to realise anything's wrong is priceless. This is as about as original as it gets. They actually manage to pull off humour, violence, decapitations, action, romance, suspense, sadness and joy all within the space of 90 minutes! The ending is hilarious, something you'll have to see for yourself.The acting is just brilliant and the actors perfectly know how to play in both hilarious/funny scene's as well as in serious/emotional one's. I've always been a huge fan of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost and their real life friendship really helps in their reel life chemistry. Anytime they're together on-screen, they just shine. Plus of course it has the wonderful Bill Nighy playing a role in it. This guy really is a terrific actor that always is at his best in comical roles like he plays in this movie.Visually the movie is really good looking. The gore, make-up and visual effects are extremely good and are even something that I haven't even seen in 'serious' Zombie/horror flicks. For a low budget film, the zombies are pretty menacing looking and there are some genuinely scary moments to be found in the movie. There's also several touching scenes between Shaun and his mum and dad...sorry, I mean step-dad(you'll know what I'm talking about when you watch the movie).There isn't really anything negative I can think of in the film. Even the action is well handled, with enough gore to satisfy any fans of zombie flicks. From beginning to end, the whole mood and the whole atmosphere continue to deliver and to entertain from moment to moment. This is NOT a spoof film, this is a unique take on the zombie genre from a British viewpoint, with a lot of humor and obvious satire thrown in, for good measure. All in all, this is a must see film which showcases Simon Pegg's talents excellently. You'll be laughing the whole time. I give it 8 out of 10.",9,1,3,9 May 2011
Hot Fuzz," One hell of a ride...comedy, action and gore...a must see for a Simon Pegg and Nick Frost fan...
","Hot Fuzz is the second film in the planned trilogy; Blood and ice cream, directed by Edgar Wright, featuring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. It is the follow up to 2004 film; Shaun of the dead, featuring primarily the same cast as Hot Fuzz, which is not strictly a sequel to Shaun of the dead, since the two films have completely different plots and characters.Simon Pegg plays Nicholas Angel, a talented young police constable in London's metropolitan police service, who is very dedicated to his job. He gets called to the station one day, and is offered a promotion to sergeant, the downside being that he has to leave London, to take his sergeant post in the crime-free, idyllic country town of Sandford, Gloucestershire. When he declines the offer, stating that he enjoys his current job, it turns out that it is no offer after all. The reasoning behind this is that he is so good at what he does, that he is making the rest of the police look bad. He is left with no choice but to take the post and leave London.In Sandford he is partnered with fellow police officer Danny Butterman, played by Nick frost, a childish and naive man, with whom Pegg's character gradually builds a friendship with. Danny and Nicholas are polar opposites. Nicholas is a perfectionist and a workaholic, while Danny is a slacker who longs for a more cinematic, action filled life. Against all odds, their personality turns out to be a perfect fit, as Nicholas mentors Danny to become a better officer, while Danny teaches Nicholas to 'switch off'.As the days go by, strange deaths starts to occur, and while Nicholas suspects murder, the rest of the force brushes it off as accidents. Maybe this town is not so crime-free after all.This all leads up to a very satisfying climax, one that I do not wish to spoil. All that I can say is that it is action packed, hilarious and exquisitely put together.Edgar Wright's comedies rely heavily on timing, and this film is no exception. The movie moves fast, and the jokes move along even faster. You can watch it over and over, and always find something new to laugh at. It is filled to the brim with jokes, each joke funnier than the last one. He has a very distinct style of cutting, with fast scenes used as transitions or visual gags. These scenes are usually very clear and straight to the point, such as the scene when he travels to Sandford, a very fast sequence of clips, primarily highlighting the facts that not much is happening.After writing, starring and directing 'Shaun of the dead' Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg turn their sights to the action/comedy genre, transposing the usual American fare and bringing it to a rustic English setting. Simon Pegg has once again proved that he is not only good with zombies but also has a Cop, oh sorry!- Super Cop. This movie is not just a master piece but also a treat of comedy, action and a real sense of humor. Simon Pegg decides in this film to take more of a straight man role and leaves most of the comedy to his friend Nick Frost, who does not let him down giving what could just have been the stooge role of Danny Butterman a great deal of charm and pathos. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are both great in their roles, delivering their dialogue perfectly. They are a perfect duo. The rest of the supporting cast do their jobs supremely well, from the Oscar-winning Jim Broadbent, through to Olivia Coleman, Kevin Eldon, Anne Reid, Adam Buxton, Bill Bailey and the supremely brilliant Timothy Dalton who excels as the seemingly obvious villain of the piece. The script and the direction are superb and the film switches effortlessly between comedy and action and occasionally horror. The other mistake that the film so deftly avoids is the desire to slap some kind of love interest in there. There is nothing you can expect in an entertainment more than this. I'm a huge fan of the duo. The chemistry between Simon Pegg and Nick Frost is simply admirable.Hot Fuzz' is at it's best with the many laugh out loud moments: the runaway goose, translating the local dialect, the human statue 'threat', the bodyguard who just says 'Naarp!', and wordplay twists throughout. These smart bits of humor make the film a keeper just be prepared for high action and some gore with your laughs. I give it a whooping 8 out of 10.",8,1,1,20 May 2011
The Way Back," A moving film, based on a true story, told beautifully by Peter Weir, amazing cinematography.
","Director Peter Weir, who also wrote the screenplay and produced this movie, has managed to create an epic film with some marvelous landscapes where the main message here is the constant struggle for life and freedom. He explores extreme situations lived by the characters in a very effective way. You can almost feel all the desperation and the great effort to keep going even in so many radical circumstances like the climate changes and starvation. In addition, I found interesting that Weir focused more on the philosophical and reflexive state of the characters instead of just showing us their day-to-day relations and interactions.About the story, after being accused of espionage in Russia during the height of communism, Zoran (Dragos Balkur) finds himself wrongfully imprisoned in a gulag in the heart of Siberia, his only thoughts ones of escape. At the gulag he meets Valka (Farrell), a thug and gangster with a knife that Zoran needs to escape. He also enlists Mr. Smith (Ed Harris), the only American in the gulag, to help with the escape and together with a few others they manage to break free from the gulag, but that's only the start of the story. From there they need to travel, on foot, thousands of miles into India, the only communist free country anywhere near them. Ronan stars as Irena, a Russian girl the escapees pick up along the way.This is a moving film, based on a true story, told beautifully by Peter Weir. The locations are gorgeous. From the harsh snow-covered trees of Siberia, a terrifying blizzard blowing through the trees, to the stark, barren landscape of the deserts between Russia and China as they travel over the sand. The viewer gets the full brunt of the harsh conditions these men needed to survive to get to safety.There are moments of rye humor, and deep emotion. And a quietly growing bond between men who have nothing in common but the journey, and their individual capacity to endure it. But some may find the film a bit slow in a number of parts so it helps to have a great interest in the subject matter. The film isn't boring, but I can see some people seeing it that way, especially if you're used to today's action movies.The finale is the most intriguing part of the movie. Tricky almost but it resonates with the sadness of these broken humans, how the woman has stood in place punishing herself for a lifetime for her betrayal, the man having to wait a lifetime to absolve her. But everything said, I just felt the emotional factor was a bit less.The performances are also great. The director took a huge risk casting Sturgess as the main lead because he is new to this game, but he did an amazing job as a man that needs to escape inescapable odds to right a wrong he didn't even admit. Farell as Valka is as brilliant as always and shows his versatility again. His scary performance as a killer and psychopath that loves the people who put him in the prison he finds himself in, is a treat to watch. He carries that menace and unpredictability around with him with great aplomb. He and his distinguishable accent are remarkable. Ed Harris has also given a solid performance as always. Ronan is great as a girl who gets help from men that shouldn't be able to give it. She has the right balance of vulnerability and strength to make her great to watch. She is great actor and a worthy Oscar nominee for her performance in The Atonement. This great cast including every other supporting actors really makes you care about the slowly bonding group as they travel mile after mile through harsh conditions and dangerous environments.One should also mention the make-up done in the movie. The make-up crew did an incredible job on how the aspect of the human body changes along such a hard journey and they certainly deserved the Oscar nomination they received.All in all, this is great inspirational movie that anyone that who enjoys a good prison escape film should watch. Big production, excellent actors, big scenery, extremely cold weather, extremely hot weather, lots of suffering by everybody involved, it's worthy to watch this movie just because of the landscapes, so vast and majestic. After all these praises, some may find my rating a bit low but the movie just lacked the heart-wrenching emotional moments that this kind of movie should have. Besides that, its a must see the movie for the amazing cinematography and commendable performances. I rate it 7.5 out 10.",7,4,7,25 May 2011
The Machinist," A must see for Cristian Bale's performance and his appearance...
","The Machinist is a psychological thriller directed by Brad Anderson, based on a script by Scott Kosar, and produced and shot in Spain after most American production companies rejected the project as weird. The Machinist plays out like something David Lynch or Stanley Kubrick might have made, but most of the strength comes from Bale's performance. It should be noted that Bale lost 60 pounds in preparation for this role, and the result is disturbing to look at. We see this man reduced to a mere skeleton, not just in body, but in mind. The whole film has shades of dark and is reminiscent of something, which we discover towards the end when the mystery unravels. Simply put, the film shows what can happen if one tries to hide something from self long enough. Christian Bale is unbelievable as the insomniac paranoiac steal worker Trevor Reznik, and one wonders why he wasn't nominated to the Oscars that year. The fact that he bothered to get so thin, a walking skeleton really, shows how committed (or crazy) he is about acting. The viewer has to be thankful, though, as his decayed physique helps his character and the movie immensely. Bale just doesn't act, he psychologically splits himself to become Reznik. And anything he does in this movie is believable, raw and authentic.Bale's counterpart Ivan is played by John Sharian, who is cheekily disturbing in his performance. You hate him immediately, physically, the way the moves, the way he dresses, the way he smiles, still, there is something appealing and warm about him. I think his performance and his physique add even more interest to the theme of Raznik's quest for identity. Aitana Sanchez Gijon and Jennifer Jason Leigh are good as Marie and Stevie, respectively. The rest of the cast are all believable in their respective supporting roles.This is a terrific movie, with a great atmosphere, a thought-provoking script, and a brilliant performance by Christian Bale. The Machinist is one of those multi-layered stories and movies from which you get new details each time you see it. The stylish cinematography and washed out colors are very effective in adding to this nightmarish atmosphere. The art direction and special effects are brilliant. Even though it starts off a little slow, the gradual building of tension is very well done and the mystery is properly revealed in the end.I love films that make you think, and this one certainly does that. Yes, at times it does get a little ponderous, but I can forgive that because it does all tie up in the end. So, over all, a well made, dark mystery thriller with a great score and a brilliant performance from Christian BaleHis appearance shows the guy's tremendous determination towards acting and everyone must appreciate that. I wonder why din't he get an Oscar nomination that year. I rate the movie 7.5 out of 10.",8,1,1,21 May 2011
Unknown," A solid action thriller...
","Unknown was a really solid action thriller. It seems like Liam Neeson has done a lot of these types of movies lately, but I enjoyed this much more than Taken (which though I loved it, was a bit clichéd). Unknown is much more than the story of a man who lost his memory and seems to have been replaced by someone taking his identity. In fact, the sheer amount of plot twists and complexities keep building up, but you never feel too lost (the exposition bordered on making things way too obvious, but always hid something from you). The action scenes are clear and well done, and there's tons of suspense and gasp-inducing moments that keep the film's momentum going.The story told in 'Unknown' is one that is not easily figured out, because it keeps taking twists and turns along the way. And it works so well, because you are constantly kept in the dark, and fed small glimpses and pieces of the bigger picture. Yet when everything becomes revealed, you will be in awe, because it was just not what would have been the most obvious outcome.Part of what made this movie different from your usual thriller was the excellent cinematography. Unknown takes place in Berlin, and the gloomy, snow-filled streets and mix of modern and traditional architecture is a really cool environment. There's a bit of CGI that looked somewhat cheap, but for the most part, the visual effects nicely complemented the story.The film is fast paced with plenty of action and it will have you scratching you head, but it does slow down from time to time to give the viewer a chance to pause for thought. That said, it's not difficult to follow what is going on ( why it is going on is another matter), so you won't have to watch it again to understand it.The acting was better-than-average for a thriller on most parts. Neeson did his usual bad-ass job, and really pulled off having lost his memory. He, like with other films he's starred in, carried it on his shoulders till the end.Diane Kruger played a cab driver pulled into the mystery, and she did a great job portraying a sympathetic character and was a strong female lead (also, incredibly beautiful). Bruno Ganz is fantastic as a former secret police officer trying to make sense of what has happened to Liam Neeson's character, Martin Harris. Frank Langella brings his customary restrained dark menace to the screen. The only one actor to disappoint is January Jones who played his wife. Her expressionless and robotic face is a big let-down. Either she had a very straight bored look on her face while she delivered her dialogs or she had a broad smile in other scenes, just trying hard to look pretty on- screen and this was it(though I must say, she looks really gorgeous and sexy)*SPOILERS ALERT* Though the movie is very entertaining, its sometimes patently absurd. I'll give one example at the start–he forgets his briefcase at the airport and realizes this at the hotel and instead of just popping his head in the door to tell his wife he's going back to get it, he just hails a cab and is gone. Then, in the cab, there is no cell service. In downtown Berlin. Okay, it's a conspiracy, and they've tampered with his phone and his wife is really a double-agent plant and so it's all logical. Except not quite. You'll see.*SPOILERS END*A lot of people have criticized the movie being similar to Taken, but the only comparison that this film has with 'Taken' is the star and the way the makers of the film have wanted the poster to be designed. After this, there is nothing else, but two good movies.'Unknown' is a quality thriller that hooks you in with intrigue and suspense and then keeps you waiting right till the end before it delivers its knockout twist. And I'll wager that you won't guess what that twist is. I rate it 8 out of 10.",8,0,3,30 May 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," Nice concept but could've have been better...
","¨All I have are the choices I make, and I choose her, come what may.¨ Ever since Adam and Eve we've never liked to be told what to do, but what would happen if all our decisions were somehow manipulated by some sort of power to make us act in a certain way without us not even realizing it? In other words, we think we have free will and we believe we make our own choices, but what if someone was making small adjustments behind our backs to make sure we followed a certain path? Those are the questions The Adjustment Bureau raises in this science- fiction romantic movie. Rookie director, George Nolfi (known for writing Ocean's Twelve and adapting the screenplay for The Bourne Ultimatum), does a great job at combining two unrelated genres such as science- fiction and romance and meshing them together to create this thought provoking film. Matt Damon plays a young politician named David Norris, running for Senator in New York. On election night while he is preparing his defeat speech he runs into Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt) in the men's restroom. There is a strong instant chemistry between them and they share a passionate kiss together, but are suddenly interrupted by security guards who were looking for Elise because she got caught crashing a wedding in the same building. David is so inspired by the kiss that he gives one of his best and most authentic speeches ever, but he can't stop thinking of Elise. Everything isn't what it seems and there are some mysterious people behind the scenes making sure everyone is following the right path. Richardson (John Slattery) and Harry (Anthony Mackie) have been following David everywhere and seem to know what decisions he is going to make and they try to manipulate them. We later find out that they work for a mysterious agency known as the Adjustment Bureau, who make adjustments in order to keep people on track so they won't deviate from the intended plan. David and Elise are not intended to be with each other, it isn't written on the books for them so Harry is ordered to keep him away from her so he will continue on the ¨right path.¨ Something goes wrong and the two meet again, only this time the agents have to make amends and end up telling David who they really are. David isn't willing to go along with the plan because he believes in free will, so the agency has to bring out their big gun, Thompson (Terence Stamp), in order for the pair to break up. The question now is: can love conquer predestination? The movie isn't deep, but it does manage to leave you thinking quite a bit, and that is always a plus. It is original and intense. It also raises questions about free will, fate, soul mates, and predestination. We'd like to believe that all our decisions are based entirely on our free will, but even we admit that sometimes coincidences take place: for example we get on the wrong bus and run into someone we haven't seen in a long time. The Adjustment Bureau claims these ¨accidents¨ are actually planned most of the time and they serve to keep their subjects on the right path in order to fulfill their purpose.The premise is good but the delivery poor, I liked the idea of a bureau that controls world destiny, but the dudes I saw in the movie could have been more slick more bad ass, when I finally settled down to accepting what was on the plate I realized half way through that nothing big was going to happen the story is simply about the bureau trying to keep Blunt's and Damon's characters apart. That was its main flaw. It din't have any twist at the end or anything BIG happening. And also the romance though its beautiful, I just din't understand how someone can fall in love so quickly so easily. These are the only problems with the movie.Yet it is oddly enjoyable, since it is less a piece of science fiction than an old-fashioned romance between an aspiring politician and a successful dancer. Each of the leads is immensely watchable and genuinely talented and together they create real chemistry. A pretty decent low key SF film. Nothing great, nothing earth shattering. But, if you want a break from all the action movies masquerading as SF, it's worth catching. I rate it 6 out of 10 for the original concept and performances.",6,1,2,13 June 2011
Rio," Great animation, but not good as the director's previous Ice Age movies...
","The movie in general is good, the plot and design of everything from the animals to the city is really good, but...I just felt that there was something missing. There's not a lot of laugh-out-loud moments like there was in the director's previous Ice Age movies which are one of my favorite animated movies of all time. This movie lacked the humour which should have been given the main focus. But nevertheless, the most astonishing side of the film is the luminous vision of Rio de Janeiro and its carnival.Blu (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg) is a talking baby macaw, who is taken from his habitat in Brazil and smuggled in a box to the United States. Falling off the back of a truck, he is given a home by Linda (Leslie Mann). They grow up together in a domestic environment and by copying her he never learns how to fly properly. Years later and a scientist named Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro) finds Linda working in a bookstore. He tells her that Blu is one the last of his kind and that he should be taken back to Brazil briefly so that he can mate with a female macaw. Linda reluctantly agrees. When placed in a cage Blu meets Jewel (Anne Hathaway), a feisty bird who is intent of escaping and is impatient to Blu's dithering. When the breeding facility is raided by smugglers, Blu and Jewel are caught and chained together in a cage. They have to learn to work together so that they can escape and find Blu's owner again.Rio Rio' is set in the exotic Brazil, amidst the world famous carnival. However, the film does not capture the same uplifting spirit. There is only enough excitement for young kids, but little for adults to enjoy. Sure, the visuals are very good, with great colours and smooth animation. The aerial scenes of Rio de Janeiro is breathtaking, but the visuals alone are not enough to make 'Rio' a success. The movie is a colourful one, but unfortunately not in a metaphoric manner. It is watchable, one can give it that, but also forgettable.Eisenberg and Hathaway are just perfect as the leads. So are all the all the supporting characters, especially my favorite Nico and Pedro voiced by Jamie Foxx and Will i Am, they were really funny. The soundtrack is one of the main plus-point of the movie. Some tunes are really catchy.This is a simple animated film for children who are going to love the monkeys and the birds, but they are also going to be nicely demonstrated that birds are so much better off and nicer in their natural environment. All the animals are cute and are likable, so are the human protagonists. Its a fun movie, not just that great as it could be. I rate it 6.5 out 10 for the beautiful scenery and awesome animation.",6,2,3,24 May 2011
The Shawshank Redemption," Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies...a fine piece of art....
","I Watched the movie 16 years after its release. I must admit that i watched it out Of curiosity for its being on the top of the IMDb list. I wasn't disappointed. Rather felt a sense of victory. It doesn't have any action sequences or any romance or Anything of the sort. But it is one of those films that makes you feel Happy inside and yet sad that you may live many more years and watch Tons of movies but never feel the same climax or emotion that you get Out of this movie. This movie had the most powerful cast and amazing script, and all based on an awesome prison drama novel by horror-master Stephen King!Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary in 1947 for the cold-blooded murder of his wife and her lover. Over the next 19 years, he does what he can to stay above the mire, consisting not only of the cruelty of his fellow inmates but the heavy hand of a brutal warden, Norton (Bob Gunton), a sadist who thumps his Bible while telling his charges that 'salvation lies within.' Andy's stubborn refusal to give up hope in the face of his incarceration engenders the wonder and friendship of several inmates, especially 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman), who nevertheless wonders about Andy's state of mind.Robbins depicts Andy Dufresne to be a reserved, humble protagonist. It is well-known that other actors were considered to play this role, such as Tom Hanks, but I believe Robbins's presence works wonders for the storyline, allowing Andy to have a quiet temperament that lets him seem at peace with himself. He has nothing on his resume close to his performance here. Freeman puts on arguably the greatest performance of his lifetime in this movie. His narration lets the viewer connect even further with all the characters, and has a poignance that stays with you long after the credits roll. His 'rehabilitated' speech ranks right up there as one of the all-time great movie moments.Character development is greatly utilized here. Pop culture references (Rita Hayworth, Hank Williams, John F. Kennedy) help give one the impression of the passage of years, and Andy's brave, witty exploits make him a likable hero. Violence and death are also put to use, with several characters dying within the story. We are made to embrace these seemingly real individuals during their airtime, and are hence moved by their tragic deaths. The failures of these characters make the final scenes of the film all the sweeter.Another standout feature of The Shawshank Redemption is the music. Oh, the music! Thomas Newman's musical score shines brightly and lends another dimension to this heartfelt tale. The triumphant piece heard at the end is one that you've likely heard before — as it has been used in movie trailers all over the world. The fact that The Shawshank Redemption did not win an Oscar for its musical score (or in any category for that matter) is almost incomprehensible. Though in a '94 class along with Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction, and The Lion King, I suppose it can be understood.I will note that it is a definite 'must see' for all those who consider themselves 'movie connoisseurs'. There are not too many negatives (if any) that can be said on the film. I will state, however, it's current #1 ranking on the IMDb Top 250 is a little bit high though.I guess I'm a little nit-picky, but my main beef is with the ending. The whole movie is about hope. *SPOILERS ALERT* If you wanted hope, then you should not have ended on a cheesy last scene where the old friends reunite and everything is alright. *SPOILERS END* It was touching, no doubt about it, but then the message of hope is dwarfed by our excitement that the two friends are together again. We leave the movie smiling instead of thinking. What I'm trying to say is that to make the core message stick to the viewers, the movie should have ended the scene before, when Red boards the bus and says, 'I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams I hope.' And as the bus drives away from the camera, the credits roll. But again, that's only an honest opinion.Watch this film alone and with attention and it will really get you involved and thinking and thats the beauty of it. I recommend it to everyone who enjoys watching beautiful cinema. I rate it 9 out of 10.For the end i leave Andy Dufresne's quote 'Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies'",9,1,1,1 June 2011
Rango," Fun all the way...Johnny Depp as rango is great...
","Rango is filled with funny and slapstick moments.But it also has some real serious sequences. This is the surprising element that should not work and still it does..The film stars a chameleon (Johnny Depp), who thinks he's an actor, going through an existential crisis, as he has lived his whole life in a terrarium. When that life is quickly—and literally—shattered, he finds himself walking in search of water. Instead, he finds a town called Dirt, where all the residents are plagued by outlaws and a severe lack of water, which is used as currency, it's so rare. Rango, seeking acceptance, assumes the role of sheriff, a role that has been played before, but with more unfortunate results. To make matters worse, someone is dumping water in the desert and draining all of dirt's resources. Rango is now in no-man's land and must escape from a Hawk who wants him FOR A MEAL! Tons of action awaits the viewer. Who could it be, what is their diabolical plan, and is Rango really the unlikely hero of his own story?In case it wasn't obvious enough from this summary, the film's tone is surreal, complex and almost shockingly mature for an animated picture. It blends in so very many movie references, blending the gritty, revisionist western with the surrealism of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, a too-obvious comparison on the latter's part. Director Gore Verbinski had a unique way of producing and directing this picture: he gathered Depp and all the other actors on a sound stage, in various costumes, acting out their scenes, as a sort of visual reference. Depp affectionately—and appropriately—called this 'Emotion capture,' as it gives the movie a more natural, organic feel, as if the reactions were believable. When it's put on screen, it's full realized in both interaction and appearance.Still of Rango What most people have touched on when talking about the pros of this movie is, indeed, the stellar animationand, boy, is it stellar. Granted, some of the human cameos are kind of on the flat side, but our animal heroes are textured and expressive, which is important in this kind of movie. We can reach out and touch these sets if we were able; the roughness of the scales, the harsh desert heat and the sponge and spikes of cacti that crop up throughout are just a few of the details in this grand visual experience. The characters that make up this floundering town are actually interesting to look at and listen to, as the animation and awesome voice work give them all distinct and likable personalities. The voices are great with each voice actor doing a fantastic job bringing these characters to life.Resident include old prospector mouse Spoons, large, but quiet tomcat Elgin, morose, trigger happy little aye-aye Priscilla (Breslin), and, my favorite, the kind, but no-nonsense Beans (Fischer), a rancher lizard who finds herself falling for the goofy, but sincere hero. But, by far, the biggest fan favorite has to be Bill Nighy's rogue, Rattlesnake Jake, who is hands-down, flat-out scary in any scene he is in! How any kid will survive his scenes is beyond me! However, that made him more of a threat that Rango needs to overcome, which is more satisfying in the long run.For movie fans there are references throughout. One that really stands out is an epic scene involving a man with no name and a golf cart.Ultimate coolness. Don't make the mistake comparing this to CGI movies like Ice Age,Kungfu Panda or similar. Approach it like it is fully fledged western that has everything and more of that genre.If you get past that than you will have the pleasure to see one of the most funny and entertaining movies made this year.However, the story has nothing new to offer. The fake hero plot is old, we've seen it in animated movies too, like Chicken Run. The liar with a potential good heart returns to save the cityThe rotten leader who sells out his people is not a bright and blossomy idea either, only in this here movie, we have the tortoise, usually an animal of wisdom, representing the corrupted character, in a rather uninspired association made out of negligence or just to avoid a more clicheistic animal. While that may seem rather unoriginal you have never seen the 'new place, new identity' gimmick done like this.This animation is a great way to introduce children to the classic western theme.The landscape is beautiful, the enemies are great and the soundtrack is perfectly suited to the film (there is a fantastic version of ride of the Valkyries). The film is packed with satirical humor that helps to keep the film fresh and helps the elements of the film to come together perfectly and you can tell that everyone was on the same page when they made this film.I rate it 7 out of 10.",7,3,5,9 June 2011
Fast Five," The BEST of the franchise!
","The franchise resurrects. The cast matures. The crew grows up. And, The Rock joins the gang. The derailed series is finally back on track since the original with upgrades in all the departments of film-making. if you think this is a movie with races, you're wrong. Taking a different route this time, the film makers have transformed the street racing franchise into the heist action film which isn't a bad thing, this transformation has worked wonders for the movie & the franchise. Fast Five is the genuine summer blockbuster of the year, without a doubt. Its the kind of big action, big Ka-pow movie that the audience doesn't want to get bogged down in the details on if they just want to have fun. The situations these guys go through is unbelievable, we know that the way these characters drive they should all have died in the first Fast and Furious, but we know this is just a fun and entertaining franchise and we try to make peace with the screenplay as best we can because it is just fun to see these guys go at it. It's fun to see them drive cars off a running train, or speed by busy streets without crashing into each other while at the same time avoiding all sorts of bullets and explosions. Fast Five might be the most unbelievable and improbable film of the franchise, but it is still the best one. While this movie doesn't have much straight up street racing its got plenty of everything else. This is the one sequel where they got the action right on all aspects. Not much CGI at all unless it was so good you couldn't tell. Vin Diesel & Paul Walker continue to be effective in their respective parts. Jordana Brewster is fair. Tyrese Gibson is first-rate and brings in a host of laughs in the goings-on. Ludicrous is good. Matt Schulze, Sung Kang & Gal Gadot are passable. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson is absolutely superb in a strong supporting role. He imposes as a formidable rival. Here Johnson's straight arrow persona leverages the story's ultimate conflict. Showcasing Director Justin Lin's signature accelerated precision, Vin Diesel's Dom races beside the speeding train as Paul Walker's Brian leaps into Dom's sports car. Their car immediately sways over a steep chasm into the river below. Diesel and Walker leap in midair out of the car, and plunge into the water. 'Fast Five' is just great fun. Writer Chris Morgan's story is better than the last 'Fast and Furious', which isn't saying much. Then again we don't see 'Fast Five' for the narrative nuances. Non-stop action reigns supreme. Lin has a crisp vibrant visual style, and acumen for insane action. Lin has two cars racing through the streets of Rio dragging a bank vault unleashing mass destruction. Granted this is over the top, and completely original. 'Fast Five' has stunning Rio de Janeiro locals, gorgeous women, fast cars, and Vin Diesel squaring off against 'The Rock' Dwayne Johnson. Lin has methodically checked off all the boxes. The Taiwanese director is getting really good with his craft. Car chase is obviously the top draw. Just as you wonder what else he can give you that you haven't seen before, he comes up with things that take you to yet another level of mindless pleasure. The movie doesn't linger onto any dramatic scenes for too long. The filmmakers know that their target audience came for the fast cars and action. Who cares about any subplots and talking? The Rock makes a grand entrance and is provided with enough screen time to make The Rock fans happy. I also like the turn of events with his character near the end. It was handled brilliantly. Fast Five delivers what it promises and even more. There are a lot of action sequences and they are shot extremely well. The cars move really fast, but that isn't all Fast Five has going for it. The addition of The Rock to the story sets up an interesting fight scene between him and Dominic(which is one of my all time favorite fight sequence). The Rock helped boost the series even more and brought something fresh to the franchise. There is also the plus that the film took place in Rio de Janeiro and the scenery there is just so beautiful. There is a great chase scene that takes place over the roofs of the houses, reminiscent of the Bourne Ultimatum scene in Morocco. Yes, the story is improbable, but we still are allowed to have fun with it. Cinematography is perfect. The soundtrack is also great.'Fast Five' is not going to win any awards. It is just great fun. I look forward to the next sequel.I rate it 7.5 out of 10.",8,2,3,18 May 2011
Moon," Utter brilliance...
","Astronaut Sam Bell, who has spent the last few years on a solitary assignment on the moon, watch-dogging a mining conglomeration of machines, is nearing the end of his shift. He's fallen into a decent, if claustrophobic routine, sculpting a small village, checking the machines, chatting with his computerized nanny, GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey). But he starts to have some problems. Spiraling deeper into what may be insanity, Sam starts to question almost everything, including his very existence.This movie was fantastic. Jones directs this with a calm hand, swooping through the abandoned base smoothly, giving the entire movie a bit of an alien feel. It's a small film telling a small story where psychological science fiction meets character study. A very welcome addition to the science fiction genre. Sometimes you really can do so much more with less. Duncan Jones does a beyond promising feature film debut for this film. The plot has many twist and turns but nothing too confusing. The Screenplay is great somehow doing a nearly impossible task of freshening up the film with only one actor for the whole film. But that is where the film really shines, the acting. Sam Rockwell is fantastic. His ranges of emotion from both of his characters is very complex. He seems to somehow make the characters the same yet very different, personality wise. He is amazing and funny and tragic, sometimes all in the same scene and GERTY, with it's animated emoticon screen and deadpan voice is pitch-perfect. Science fiction is invariably a fairy tale nowadays. You can probably connect with a handful of movies showing a fictional future. Most just serve to entertain with cheap visual thrills. Moon is an exception to this degradation of scientific imagination in our modern day script writing. Instead of pondering over the power levels of imaginary 'cores' and flashy laser weaponry, this movie strives to ask difficult questions from the audience. Questions that will leave you with no clear answers long after you have seen, dissected and digested the movie.Script is remarkably simple and there are no 'big' secrets except one, which is revealed around the middle. The rest of the story is what gets the gray cells all juiced up. Instead of delivering a complicated plot, the movie delivers a complicated premise. Soundtrack is excellently suited to the pace and texture of the story telling. Visuals are clean and precise, and most importantly believable – without being boring. The dialogs are also well – real ! No flamboyance or theater grade facial mannerisms here. Just plane and simple acting, done in a most convincing manner.I rate it 8 out of 10 for its brilliance.",8,1,5,17 June 2011
