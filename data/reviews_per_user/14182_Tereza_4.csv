The Blair Witch Project," Didn't scare me ... until I tried to go to sleep!
","This is one of those movies that I wasn't too impressed with when I first saw it in the cinema. The shaky camera work (yes, I realize it was intended to be that way) and the quick movements of the camera made me wish I were drinking Pepto Bismol rather than soda. But after I came home and curled up in bed that night, my mind started wandering and the film content started to bother me. If a film keeps me up all night, it means it's a good one. I appreciated its artistry much more upon watching it a second time.",9,1,2,31 October 1999
Spice World," I Shouldn't Have Liked This, But ...
","BUT ... I DID! I rented this movie for only one reason: I am a HUGE fan of Alan Cumming, and I was curious what the heck he was doing in this movie. Well, Alan's role was not worthy of his enormous talent, but shockingly I found this movie, as a whole, entertaining. I was even more shocked to find that a couple of the girls actually had some talent (I won't name names to protect the worshipers) I've never paid attention to the Spice Girls -- their music is okay, but not something I would buy. There were some really lame parts to the movie (the flashes to the future, the whole baby thing, etc.), but overall it was somewhat amusing. It's too bad that it was all fabricated -- they should have taken a Madonna 'Truth or Dare' approach -- maybe then the critics would have been more kind. However, I liked the cameo performances by Elton John, Bob Hoskins, etc. and I loved the takes on other movies and songs (e.g. Spice Girl Five aka Tarantino's Fox Force Five in Pulp Fiction, etc. and Meatloaf's line about 'I won't do that'). Anyway, I don't know who to recommend this movie to. After seeing the movie, those who hate them will only hate them more, and those who love them continue to do so. Perhaps people, as myself, who are ambivalent about the Spice Girls could like this movie.",7,1,2,28 January 2000
The Mummy," The MUMMY is YUMMY, But GEORGE should have stayed in the JUNGLE!!
","When the film began with a very ancient feel, I thought 'this is going to be great!' I was anticipating a dark and mysterious film, but then George of the Jungle popped on screen with his goofy sidekicks. I haven't seen many of Fraser's movies, but can he do anything besides a goofy persona?Well, okay, the movie *was* fun and entertaining. But the movie would be forgettable if it weren't for Arnold Vosloo (the mummy). He is HOT! Someone put this man a good role FAST (and please let me keep his accent)! From the looks of his resume, he's starred in a string of poor to mediocre films ... now's a prime time for someone to snatch him for a great movie.",7,0,0,8 August 1999
When Harry Met Sally...," 10 years and going strong for this classic romantic comedy!
","Has it really been 10 years since this film was released? I saw it at the theater all those years ago, and I've watched it at least once a year since then. It hasn't lost its charm! It's a well-scripted, well-acted love story with a twist that has yet to be duplicated. The soundtrack is wonderful too -- it's hard to believe that Harry Connick Jr. was only 21 at the time. If you haven't seen this one yet, give it a try.",10,0,1,8 August 1999
