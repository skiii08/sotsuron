The Blair Witch Project," Carry on Camping was funnier
","Possibly the most hyped art-house film of all time,BWP is just that hype and not much else.Take a camcorder on your next camping holiday and I`m sure you can produce similar results.This film might screw with the minds of a few fifteen year olds but it don`t scare me no sir.Check out the adult version(I think it`s called the Blow witch Project)it`s far more  entertaining.The young actors here do a quite convincing job though,despite a lame script and I`m sure we`ll be seeing more of them.",6,0,2,23 December 1999
