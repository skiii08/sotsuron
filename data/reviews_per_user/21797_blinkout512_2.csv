Come and See," This is true war.
","This story is not about war in its' stereotypical sense. Though yes, the main conflict is of an ideological, religious, and nationalistic nature, it is not a war of such. Rather it is a war of the human mind and soul, more specifically, a young boy's mind and soul as he witnesses the atrocity of actions committed with no legitimate reasoning.This is made all the more haunting by the realism conveyed in this film. Thanks to the desire to create the most realistic portrayal possible, nearly everything was filmed as is - you will feel as if you are there, (and, at some points in the film, you actually may be). There are no stand-ins; the actors actually did this during filming. Therefore, every image is that much more haunting because you feel a direct connection to the characters.It's a shame this isn't one of the more well known war films to the general public. It's easy to see why not - this is not about spectacle, explosions or patriotism. This is about trying to escape war physically while realizing that mentally and emotionally - it is a black hole from which there is no escape.",8,1,1,8 June 2008
Ran," An great addition to Kurosawa's body of work
","While I'm a fan of Kurosawa's work, I'm not necessarily one of Shakespeare's (that is to say, I don't like him at all). So when I found out that Ran was based off of Shakespeare's King Lear I was already having concerns, even though I had never read King Lear in depth . However, all concerns vanished once the film started.All at once a tale about devotion, betrayal, war and most of all, family, Kurosawa's take on the story is epic yet intimate, all at once an outlook on three warring nations as well a look at the nature of sibling hood and fatherhood, of families broken, and of vengeance. Fantastic performances by the actors (including a deceptively incendiary performance by Mieko Harada as Lady Kaede) only add more to the film.From the opening credits to the tragic finale (after all, this is a tragedy), the film is captivating. A powerful work.",8,0,2,8 June 2008
