The Blair Witch Project," The Emperor's New Clothes in the woods
","I give the creators of Blair Witch Project credit for a masterful job in selling their movie to the public, but... it was NOT scary or interesting, just annoying.  Long before the end I'd lost all interest and, frankly, was just waiting for Heather and her pals to die and get it over with.  A major waste of my time.",3,0,1,22 July 2000
The Red Violin," very overrated
","With all the rave reviews, I was extremely disappointed and, yes, bored by this overrated film.  None of the stories had a payoff, one (the Oxford scene) was laughable, and the finale was ridiculous.  A real waste of time.",5,1,4,23 June 2000
