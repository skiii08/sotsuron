Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Visually and aurally fabulous - though a bit wanting in story
","I was lucky enough to get to the first regular North American showing of Episode 1.  Newfoundland being 1 and 1/2 hours ahead of EST and a 12:01 a.m. showtime helped :-) I have to say first off, it was a wonderful show.  The visual effects grabbed you and held you and the sound was incredible though I found the story a bit wanting.  I didn't find myself particularly drawn to or connecting with any of the characters and I think I would have wandered a bit if it wasn't for the sound and images.  But!! Hold me they did! I think the original trilogy had the same problem... simple stories (and a bit preachy) but the effect on your senses made them wonderful movies.  So this one will join the original trilogy among my favourites. It won't win any Oscars for anything other than technical achievement but everyone will see it 3 or 4 times or more :-)",9,0,0,19 May 1999
