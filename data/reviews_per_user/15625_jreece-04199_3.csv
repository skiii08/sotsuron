Blade Runner 2049," Awful was my comment after movie
","I really liked the earlier Blade Runner, which had great visuals and an intriguing story. This version is dark and dismal and very violent. The violence toward women is extremely gruesome, and there was a lot of unnecessary female nudity. The women seemed to be either ruthless killers or prostitutes. The most 'real' woman is not real at all. There is very little character development to help move the winding plot along. Harrison Ford is good, of course. The movie is way too long and the slow pace is just annoying in some scenes. I was sorry I went, and I will never watch this movie again.",1,8,15,24 October 2017
Jojo Rabbit," Thought provoking and funny
","This is an anti war movie like Dr. Strangelove. It's funny, sad, disturbing, and enlightening, and the acting is outstanding. Nice to see ScarJo playing a rest woman and mom, and the kids were all great. Waititi is crazy and amazing!",10,0,1,21 February 2020
Green Book," Great movie that reminds us we still have miles to go
","Went to see this movie with my husband and two good friends, and we all thought it was great! The acting by Mortensen and Ali is outstanding, and the rest of the cast is excellent as well. The performances are authentic and the directing is well paced. The costumes, sets, score ... everything was really well done. Based on a true story, Green Book is moving, funny, thought provoking, and, in the end, a heart warming story of friendship and family-the one you're born with and the one you make along the road.",9,2,3,30 January 2019
