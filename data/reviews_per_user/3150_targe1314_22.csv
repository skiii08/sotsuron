Blade Runner 2049," A visually stunning Masterpiece with an intricate but interesting plot
","Los Angeles, 2049.The human experiment has flourished in space.9 new colony worlds now exist in the sky. This was achieved with the use of manufactured slave labor, Replicants.On earth, the experiment has failed. Earth has been largely abandoned to the rats and the rainstorms, as global warming is pushing the planet rapidly towards the next Ice Age. The seawalls barely hold back rising sea levels... people grovel in the muck for grubs to eat.Across this barren landscape flies K, a new series replicant assassin, hunting down humanity's mistakes, the bad dog replicants that broke their programming.Do Robots dream Electric Sleep?Do Canadians attend movies on Thanksgiving Weekend?The answers it appears, are Yes and No.Being a huge fan of the original, the theatre was largely empty on opening night, mostly filled with people my age, watching faithfully for another taste of the original's dark noir, flying cop cars and giant neon backwashed with torrential rain...You cannot compare this to the original. For although it faithfully picks up the threads of Deckard(Ford)'s old fling, this is a deep and well written detective story, not the action-packed retirement bloodbath that marked the original.The music, straying between Tibetan chant and Apocalypse Now synth, is deep, loud, and foreboding, matching the bleak and over-built LA city scape to a tee.The visuals, from the titanic last ditch wall built to stop the rising sea levels to the endless solar panel farms, is jaw dropping.Ryan Gosling is at the top of his game here, throwing everything into the role as the at first blankly confident uber assassin K, while still revealing a tender side in his 1950's housewife 3D hologram girlfriend. As his latest case develops, we see his mind conflict and break down. This could be his finest work and he should Oscar up for it.Harrison Ford brings his legendary gravitas in full force to the role of the fugitive Deckard, hiding in his luxury Vegas penthouse, drinking scotch and staring out at the dust storms. Ford leaves nothing in reserve as he launches his heart back into this character that helped to make him famous. His haunted scream 'WE WERE BEING HUNTED!' sends shivers down the spine...Supporting cast are also for the most part in excellent form, with Robin Wright playing K's stern but secretly in love Madame commander, doing anything to keep the lethal secret that 'will break the world' from getting out, protecting her agent to the last.Ana de Armas puts in a surprisingly heartfelt and believable performance as the 'pinnoccio-like' 3D hologram girlfriend, desperately trying to have a real relationship, knowing all too well there is no hope.Jared Leto brings a solid performance as the mad scientist maker of the new replicants, with some apologies to the blind community perhaps.Perhaps the only slight let down is our main villain. Unfortunately she must go up against the likes of Rutger Hauer from the original, no small boots to fill. Sylvia Hoeks plays the over-passionate killing machine Luv, a replicant assassin slash secretary in heels on steroids well, but there is something too souless in her act, something missing. No rousing speech about attack ships burning at the end for her, just a slow, cruel, difficult to watch drowning.After watching in Ultra AVX 3D I immediately purchased new tickets for IMAX, and it was worth the extra. This is a movie that really MUST be seen in IMAX. How else to enjoy a 100 foot tall virtual naked blue woman advertising the popular JOi hologram girlfriend? Or the expanse of the sea wall, or the scale of the garbage dump?",10,1,6,10 October 2017
It," A masterful reimagining of the Stephen King classic
","I grew up on Stephen King horror, as many my age did. When the awful TV movies began, clearly designed as pulpy B quality from the beginning, I groaned, imagining what might have been...It was with great skepticism that I went in to this new version.It's hard to capture the nature of Pennywise, without it coming off as campy. Much as numerous actors, including the great Jack Nicolson, tried and failed to capture the nuances of the Joker character, and it wasn't until Heath Ledger forever immortalized him shortly before dying, that the character was realized in full.So too, has Pennywise finally been captured in 'his' full, inhuman, beyond-evil ancient demi-god predator from the abyss nature, in this film, awkwardly attempting to mimic human things, fears, and attractions to draw in it's prey.Bill Skarsgard, in perhaps the role of his career, expertly captures Pennywise to a T, apparently terrifying the young actors on the set to some degree as well.The movie finally captures the dread feelings I felt as I read this book. It felt like living inside the book again.Excellent performances are also turned in by the young gang of 'losers'. Sophia Lillis turns in a fantastic performance as the young Scarlett Johannson look-alike Beverly, a tortured young girl harassed and sexually objectified by every male in town.Finn Wolfhard attempts to steal the entire movie with is one-liners, and often succeeds, capturing the right blend of young humour with awkward mid-teen angst.The movie is perfectly propped for the 80's, look for the movies of that generation prominently displayed on the movie theatre each time it is used, more than once.One word of advice - I saw many very young children being taken into this movie by deadbeat parents who won't spring for a sitter. This movie IS NOT for children. IT will give your children nightmares. It is a genuinely terrifying movie.",9,4,10,11 September 2017
Fury," A visual masterpiece that falls short on accuracy
","I had high expectations watching this movie, as I am a huge WWII tank buff and love the late model Shermans.Sadly, this movie was over the top and completely ridiculous, even more so than Saving Private Ryan, which until now was my worst modern WWII movie.If you don't give a damn about historical accuracy then proceed no further as I have no time for you....If you really want to understand tank combat, in WWII, then proceed further...First, a history lesson. The Americans produced a very successful tank, the Sherman, during WWII. It was very easy to build, very easy to drive and fire, and they pumped them out like sausages.The Germans, they went the other direction, starting in mid-WWII, they began producing very sophisticated tanks, including the Tiger I, the Panther, and late war, the Tiger II and JadgPanther (tank hunter) tanks. These tanks were very expensive, in very short supply, and the majority of tanks that the American shermans faced in the D-Day landings and beyond were the earlier Panzer-III and IV models. The IV was a basic match for the Sherman.OK, so the movie starts with some random German officer riding his white horse through a battlefield, and getting jumped by a tank commander. this is ludicrous. No German officer would risk his life alone to ride through a recent battlefield. Silly.The tank commander orders his new hull gunner to execute a German prisoner... Completely false and a HUGE insult to our veterans! The tank crew gets drunk and storms the tank commander's party. In WWII, that would have earned you an immediate court martial if they did not leave the room IMMEDIATELY. The tank commander was GOD, and he decided if you were going to be dragged away by the MP's or not.A Tiger Mk 1 charges across an open field to engage 4 Shermans. Crazy. The Tiger was a long distance engager. It would sit back with it's 88mm gun and pick off enemy targets at will. It took an average of 5 sherman tanks, rushing it at FULL SPEED, to take one Tiger out. 4 of the 5 Shermans would NOT SURVIVE. THIS IS WAR, and the Americans knew this, which is why the Sherman crews would bail out as soon as they heard an 88mm shell landing anywhere near them! They knew their country had the advantage in production, and a new tank would be coming soon down the road.On hitting a tank mine... you DO NOT send your crew to check out the local area! You are asking them to be ambushed and trigger further booby traps! Crazy stupid tactics. Any tank commander would leave the sides of the road for the infantry backup.You are a single enemy tank in hostile territory and you find out a company (300+) of enemy infantry is moving on you. What do you do? Well, the easiest answer is you call in artillery and air support and get the hell out of there, on foot if possible.A force this size, especially with anti-tank panzerfaust weapons as portrayed in the movie, is bad news. They will easily surround your tank, overcome the defenses, climb on board if they have to, and chuck grenades and high explosives down your hatches.The tank commander takes 1 or 2 bullets and falls down into the tank and does not immedietely call for medical help.Finally, if you want to watch a decent tank movie, watch 'the beast', which is about a T-62 tank crew in Afghanistan.Before you reply to this, I am an experienced Canadian Soldier with multiple years of experience...",6,2,7,9 February 2015
Thor: Ragnarok," A silly but fun movie that should have come out for summer
","I was dragged, kicking and screaming, into this joke movie, and came out entertained and happy.Thor: Ragnarok is basically what happens when the Marvel Super Heroes space jump into the world of Guardians of the Galaxy. The movie has the same look, feel, jokes, and soundtrack of the GotG series (and YES, I know they are supposed to exist together! This is the first film that makes it OBVIOUS).Chris Hemsworth, otherwise known as 'Girl eye candy with a tool', jumps into this with a smirk and a fine set of gag reel jokes. Finally watching him battle, not once but TWICE, to the legendary Thor/Vikings song 'The Immigrant Song' by Led Zepplin, was also a treat.Cate Blanchett is surprisingly better looking as a Brunette, having great fun as Thor's evil older sis, Hela (or is it Hell... or is it Hell Ya!)Tom Hiddleston is rather droll in comparison, just 'going through his Loki paces' and not surprising anyone. He seems very annoyed in the end to have to fight beside his brother finally, even though we all know he secretly loves him and looks up to him. He also gets his ass handed to him by a Valkryie, which is strange...Hulk is very different in this movie now, more a giant caveman, he talks!Jeff Goldblum, always up for playing the buffoon, is a bit of a show stealer and very distracting in his over the top performance.Finally, Tessa Thompson gives the guys something to drool over as the fun and sexy only surviving Valkryie, drowning her sorrows in a giganto bottle of scotch and domming Thor like a pro.Again, this show was so Guardians... I'm surprised there isn't some easter eggs in it, is there? Do we see Rocket in the background of a scene, or perhaps Star Lord's sweet ride in the spaceport? I wish we do.",7,0,3,15 November 2017
The Hateful Eight," Another Tarantino contrived art house flick
","Am I the only one to state that the Emperor has no clothes? Why do people rave about Quentin's movies, when a good western remake like True Grit is lightyears better, and enjoyable to watch?Quentin CANNOT make Westerns. This is evidenced first by his disastrous train wreck of Django. Now we have another western, again, teeming with black people and other bizarre out of place characters (a strange British fop) and out of place music.This is a CLUE board game movie set in a cowboy snowbound cabin setting.NOTHING about this movie makes any sense. The cabin itself is full of holes! The people inside have plenty of nails and lumber, as is evidenced by their insanely stupid 'door lock system' of hammering boards over the door every time someone comes in, yet they put zero effort into chocking up the many cracks and holes in the place.The huge cast of black people, in a Wyoming set Western, makes absolutely no sense whatso-ever. Can someone tell me when it was finally legal for a black person to travel by stage coach? I'm guessing the 1930's? And only then with all-black stagecoaches and drivers?So OK, this is a classic CLUE who-dunnit movie, set in a Western, with lots of quirky characters like Colonel Neo-nazi Mustard, Professor Hangman Plum, etc.. And as that, it is very poorly done. We have very few clues to work with, no meat at all except wild speculation leading to executions in some parts. We have glaring stupidity in others, like a shady Mexican who would call himself 'Bob' to avoid suspicion?The central focus of the violence and mayhem in this movie is an EXTREMELY UNCONVINCING Jen J. Leigh as a high level gang leader who is facing the noose if her bounty hunter owner can get her to the city. She does NOT carry this role at all, and comes across as a WITCH, especially when she is literally covered in blood-vomit and has her teeth smashed in to resemble a vampire, a get-up she wears for half the movie. She cackles a lot too. So clearly, Jen was channeling CARRIE. The movie also takes a completely unnecessary side duck into softcore domination porn, something Quentin relishes in, witness the end of Pulp Fiction, that should have earned this movie an NC-17 rating, but if it's QT, they write it up to 'art' and move on. It's not art, it's disgusting soft core domination porn, and completely unnecessary for the script and the movie.The movie ends with some gratuitous death-porn as we watch the witch slowly get hoised up to the rafters with a noose, slowly choking to death as the 'heroes' laugh and joke about her.In between we are treated to endless hours of plodding dialogue, punctuated by the odd gunshot. After Django I swore I'd never watch another Tarantino Western again, and thank god I saw this on TV.",6,0,1,8 May 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," A mediocre addition to an already bloated superhero catelogue
","What has Marvel done to Spiderman?I'm of the opinion that once a movie has 'topped', in short, realized it's full potential, achieved all the glory you may have imagined it, from reading the books or watching the much crapp-ier versions, I'm done, I'm OUT. I won't watch again.This is, of course, very problematic for the movie money generating machine, which must continuously pump out the tried-and-true tropes and stories that always gen cash.Apparently one of those is poor Spiderman, who has gone from the initial high of Tobey Maguier's near perfect rendition, backed by a solid Goblin from Willem Dafoe, to this... half melted slushy on a 711 floor, with Michael Keaton (!) as the really boring lame villain, Aunt May is a drop dead gorgeous ailf, and Mary Jane is non-existent as a love interest. Uncle Ben is gone. Tony Stark provides and taketh aways all the toys. No back story is explained. No radioactive spider is explained. Peter needs his own goo-spitters.I was dragged into this by my 17 yo daughter, who liked it, and that's who this is written for. But ONLY this time. NO parents will enjoy, as opposed to the first time out.This is by far the worst spiderman movie since the first of the 'new orginals' blew us all out of the water.",4,6,47,31 July 2017
The Lost City of Z," A bunch of guys, mumbling in the dark
","I went in with high hopes, I like Indiana Jones, was this guy the spiritual inspiration for him? I like ancient cities in the jungle. I knew they just found one in the forests of Peru with satellite software. This movie could have been so much more.Instead we are 'treated' to endless 'in-the-dark room filming', with stoffy English gentlemen 'harrumphing' at each other endlessly.When our hero finally DOES find the ancient city, by magically riding a river BACKWARDS up it on a raft to it's source, he finds, a black panther guarding a bunch of broken pottery under the leaves....Big Tip for the director here... Ancient Cities bury EVERYTHING in feet of dirt when they go vanished, EXCEPT their gigantic cyclopean RUINS.... you know, the gigantic step pyramids?? People think they are triangle shaped mountains? This is all that remains. You certainly don't find them by tripping over broken pottery that is scattered around on the jungle floor, which would make it at most, what, 100 years old?After weeks and weeks of searching for this, (or is it years and years... we really don't know, his wife was preggers when he left, and has a 1 year old when he returns, yet somehow mysteriously his son has aged at least 5 years...), he immediately does a 'well, that was neat. Let's get back.' and they jump back on the raft and leave, with ZERO exploration, investigation, anything.Then we have a brief interlude in WWI, where our hero charges a German machine gun position with a pistol, get's gassed, and loses his vision.One annoying thing is this movie was the attempt to bring modern day morality and rights into early 20th century England. Women demanding equal treatment and defying their husband, and children yelling at their father. It was all very jarring and 'out of period'. If your going to do a historic piece, make it historic, complete with the sexism, the heavy handed discipline, etc etc.Finally the sound quality in this movie is atrocious. We had to dial it up to 75 to make out what they were saying in many scenes, and then you realize it's because they are mumbling! Mumble mumbles, all the way through, and WAY too many dark scenes. Dark English mansions. Dark ship holds. Dark jungle floors. You need a flashlight to watch this.",5,9,13,8 August 2017
Justice League," DC finally moving in the right direction
","I was cautiously happy with the latest DC movie Justice League. They are still filming in grey monochrome (other than Superman's farm) but at least now the tone is lighter and the action sequences are better, the jokes are better too.By far the best job is done by the Flash, as Ezra Miller turns in a fantastic effort on his role, which he is clearly stoked on.Less stellar is Ben Affleck's second time out in the batcape. I've heard he wants out, and it showed in this movie. He plays Batman as a brooding, guilt-ridden shadow, not up to leading the team, hoping WW takes it over, almost as if he was playing himself.Aquaman as a dark haired Conan the Barbarian is a jarring sell, but it was okkkaaaaayyyy....... nothing to stop the presses about.Perhaps the breakout unexpected performance was from Ray Fisher, playing the tortured man-robot Cyborg, full of self-loathing but wanting ultimately to help.Special nod to the Batmobile, surely the greatest batmobile ever since the original, covered in guns it is a terror on 4 wheels. Batman's crawling spider-thing (name is forgettable) was less so, very silly in fact and one wondered what sort of cocaine trip Bruce Wayne was on to craft such an impractable piece of oversized junk.Overall though this is a good start for a 'DC Rennaissance' and I hav e high hopes for the future, and would not be unhappy at all if they brought in a new Batman. Christian Bale, you are SORELY MISSED.....",8,0,4,20 November 2017
Split," A new monster prowls the xmen world of Shyamalan
","This director is definitely a chance taker, and often is either loved or reviled by movie goers.This outing, he is actually just staying the course on standard abduction-by-psycho movies, but with his own twist.First a DISCLAIMER.If you are a psychologist, please do NOT come on here and lecture us all about how this movie is highly inaccurate about the portrayal of Multiple Personality Disorder or MPD (DID).This movie is NOT a documentary on mental health, and does not try to be.This is a horror/abduction movie, featuring a super villain who can access mutant x powers when he transforms into his 'evil-ist' personality. The movie has some weak points, such as the violence is kept very low key to avoid bumping the rating up, two of the girls die very quickly near the end and it's not explained at all, again likely to reduce the gore factor, and the super-human abilities of the shifter beast is not explained or believable.Look for stand out performances by: James McAvoy, in his first evil role and after playing multiple incantations of the goody-good Professor X, does a very good job of portraying the mentally ill villain, who is always pretending to be a victim and weak to the very good performance of Betty Buckley who plays his psychologist. Anya Taylor-Joy also puts in a very good performance as the damaged cutter teen, from an abusive relationship, who turns out to be the only one with the skillsets required to stay alive in the beast's lair.Shyamalan perhaps has been watching the success of the multiple tie-in Marvel movies, and has decided to now do the same with his alt- universe of mutant humans he first showed us in 'Unbroken'. Yes, this movie ties in to Unbroken, one of Shyamalan's best movies.",7,1,4,29 May 2017
Dunkirk," One of those Highly Annoying Jump Around in Time movies, about a bunch of guys standing on a beach
","I went into Dunkirk with high hopes, respecting the director, and impressed with what I had seen from the previews, but expecting they were hiding the best for last in the movie.I left confused, disappointed, and as I walked back over the movie, I grew increasingly so.This movie, which, if we were to believe the media hype around it, is a proud return to the stellar WWII movies of our youth, in short, a complete opposite to the disaster that was the 2001 Pearl Harbour movie. NO CGI!!! We are informed, as if that somehow indicates the signs of a GOOD movie...Instead we are treated to an incredibly boring 2 hours of guys standing on a beach, an old fella driving his boat, and some very leisurely and boring flying.I was disappointed going in that the movie was only 2 hours. 'Barely enough time to give such a subject the grandeur it deserves' many were saying.Instead I was staring at my watch, begging this snore fest to be done, and begging that the ludicrous stories would not be overtopped by even more ludicrousness.I was wrong, the finale, which I'll get to, is so completely ridiculous that one wonders if they were hoping for zero pilots in the audience.No, I'm not a WWII war buff who is going to rip this movie a new one because of technicalities. The mistakes are both small and huge in this movie, and seemingly never ending.The movie makes an attempt to separate the topics into 3 main areas: Land, Sea, and Air. Or, to be more accurate, Boring scenes of guys standing around at the beach, lots of guys drowning in multiple ship sinkings while grandpa putters with his son and friend to the rescue, and leisurely Sunday flight maneuvers with a couple of planes.LAND.In trying to be realistic, C. Nolan, instead of CGI'ing the spectacle of 400,000 desperate soldiers crowding on a beach awaiting rescue, we are shown maybe 500, many of which are apparently cardboard. It's about the size of a rock concert lineup outside the stadium on Friday night, for an old 70's band. The guys are bored, we are bored.Occasionally a dive bomber comes down to drop some bombs and kill 1 guy or 2. Then back to smoking and staring at the sea. When this seems like it will just never end, we get a scene change as some soldiers find an old boat and try to sit in it and wait for the tide. Yes, this is a riveting scene of guys sitting in a boat waiting for the tide to come in. And it's exciting compared to what we saw previously. Then a guy loses his mind and decides someone must die, for some bizarre reason, he figures if one guy get's out the bullethole ridden hulk will finally float.SEA.We are treated so multiple ship sinkings and guys drowning. It's never ending. If you are a shipwreck survivor, I HIGHLY Recommend YOU AVOID THIS MOVIE!!!! It will re-ignite your PTSD. We see the same sinking over and over, from multiple angles because? THIS MOVIE JUMPS AROUND IN TIME.I am biased, as I ABSOLUTELY HATE movies that jump around in time. This is one of the worst I have seen in years for that.AIR.They have only 1 German bomber left that can fly, apparently, so we are treated to that, exactly ONE bomber. Flying around and around, aka jump around in time, from multiple angles. Now the technical details come to the front, as droves of pilots walk to the exits. The spitfire fighters have an inexhaustible supply of bullets. The German planes refuse to get out of the way of the bullets. The spitfire pilots appear bored as bullets strike their planes. All planes execute lazy, civilian aircraft lazy turns and banks, as if they are all out for a nice Sunday fly.The spitfire pilot flies around for the last ten minutes with his thumb on the fire trigger, as if he doesn't know what the heck he is doing. Then he proceeds to glide for about 10 minutes with no fuel, and shoot down a German plane, in a heavy fighter plane that would have been on the beach in 2 minutes with zero banking or turning. He glides up and down the beach like this for what seems an eternity. It is maddening.Finally, a guy ditches his plane in the drink but FORGETS TO OPEN HIS CANOPY FIRST. A cardinal sin for any pilot. He is rescued by a kid with a boathook, who somehow manages to chop through his canopy in one blow, even though it's already under water. Cringeworthy.MUSIC FAULTSAs a young lad loads lifejackets onto his dad's boat, we are treated to a hammering tension filled score that one would expect for the imminent attack of JAWS. No jaws, or Godzilla happens, just... a ... kid... slowly loading lifejackets... on a boat.SOUND FAULTSAs stated, they accidentally put the '20mm cannon guns firing' noise over top of the German bomber machine guns firing. See Battle of Britain for a properly done WWII flying picture.EDITING FAULTSThe movie jumps around in time so much one is quickly infuriated. It appears we are watching 20 minutes of film that is stretched to 2 hours using the multiple camera angles.FALSE DANGERSFinally,There was zero rough stormy seas during Dunkirk. It was the opposite actually, unusually calm.There was zero issue with the tide at Dunkirk. They had boarding options all the way from high tide to low.Both of these are used as tension elements and plot elements in the movie.",4,9,17,24 July 2017
Ex Machina," Nothing new here, same pedestrian robot movie
","I had high expectations for this movie, as we are really on the cusp of entering the singularity, the dawn of the first sentient AI.Instead I'm treated to a crap movie about sex bots, with all the best questions on AI already covered in Bicentennial Man and ... lol, A.I.The premise is that a young hotshot AI programmer is brought to the forest retreat of his CEO, as a special reward, to meet his newest robot creation and perform the Turing Test.The reality, clearly given away in the trailers, is he actually brought him there to see if he would fall in love with his sex bot, and if she would also figure out sexuality and love.Now if this movie had truly had any BALLS, it would have dove head first into that, with full on soft core porn scenes between the young guinnea pig and the mad scientist's Love Bot, who we learn later designed her face by averaging the young guy's most common porn star google vids preferences on the Internet.We could have had them fall in love after this raunchy intro, and they both genuinely believe they are in love, while all the while the mad nutjob puppet master watches and pulls the strings, as they plan their doomed escape attempt.Instead we get endless scenes of boring dialogue, drunken rants, whispered fears in the dark. Ava is not nearly seductive enough to accept, yet we know the loony scientist has several earlier sex robot models of MUCH hotter fem-bots. This is all revealed at the end of the movie like it is some sort of insane revelation. Saw it coming 2 miles out.The ending is also full of questions on believability, as Ava makes her escape. Getting on a scheduled helicopter meant for someone else... pilot does not even question this. She requires recharging every day... how is she going to do that now? She has no identity... how shall she interact with our identity crazed world? Huge disappointment, only saved by amazing scenery and robot special effects.",6,1,2,5 November 2015
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A huge but un even rollercoaster ride of entertainment and disappointment
","Star Wars the last Jedi is a very long movie, and there was ample room for cuts, witness the jarring and completely pointless scene of Luke drinking raw seal milk on the beach... uh... yeah....We are treated to amazing visuals, and some fantastic scenes. The death of Snoke was very satisfying, even if it made no sense from a story perspective.The humor was in places very funny (Chewy and his roast chicken) and in places extremely awkward (the milk drinking scene as mentioned above)Luke does a serviceable job in the end of what he is portraying, a shell-shocked hermit who has lost most of his high hopes for the Jedi but tries to cling to the origins, namely the Force.Daisey is at times well done, her trip into the cave of darkness, and at other times clumsy and ham-fisted (her pathetic attempts to convince Luke to join her by physically assaulting the poor old man).We have new characters that just.. do not fly. I know with the MASSIVE Chinese investment of audience now for these movies, it is essential that Disney get more Chinese characters in play (rather overdue and racistly so...) but the new Chinese character, Tran, is not doing it, her acting is atrocious and her hair-do is an abomination.And Laura Dern.... I have no IDEA what they were thinking with this one.... and it fails miserably. Every second of her screen time is cringe-worthy.Then again, throwing in big name actors turns around and actually WORKS with Benicio Del Toro, even if his lispy stutter doesn't. The man has GRAVITAS and he brings it to an otherwise luke-warm (lol) showing.The writing is uneven as well. I actually am starting to like Adam Driver (blasphemous as those words are) and his story arc. Finn OTOH though, continues to plod along as the love-sick b/f. He even get's a completely useless comedy scene of him staggering around in a giant suit of saline solution which only serves to ridicule his character.Poe is played strangely here, he is clearly an audience favorite, but the Rebels go around hating on him constantly. It is very annoying and could only have been explained if Laura Dern's character was an Empire Agent, which, sadly, she is not.And finally a huge GEEK RAGE OUT on the DEUS EX MACHINA of using a hyper-jump to destroy an entire fleet of Star Destroyers. Why doesn't this destroy all fleets that hyperjump together then? We all know for the entire Star Wars series entire fleets of ships have hyper-jumped together. So now all of a sudden this causes a huge explosion that destroys all the ships??? It made ZERO sense, and then to have the flagship, which has literally been torn into TWO PIECES, still have the ability to land a AT-AT assault unit???THAT is SLOPPY WRITING.",7,0,0,18 December 2017
Logan," A classic lone wolf cowboy tale
","This is definitely one of Hugh Jackman's best films, as the grizzled old wolverine with a permanent limp. Also was a pleasure to see Patrick Stewart play a demented old man to perfection.The fight scenes are visceral as they should be when your slashing around adamantium claws. The only let down was Logan's daughter- wolverine didn't get to show off her toe claws, I didn't actually see them once, would have been nice to see her disembowel some bad guys with them.This movie is dark, depressing, bloody and well written. Expect to leave the theatre exhausted and ready to snick your wrists.The villain was okkkkaaaaayyyyy, not the worst villain, not the best. The children mutants were not very powerful and came off as lame, but perhaps their powers will grow. Let's hope they find sanctuary in Canada.",8,2,6,8 March 2017
Sinister," An OK horror flick with annoying lack of believability and too easy to figure out
","Let's start with the title. Sinister. Really. Has to be the most banal and boring horror movie title you can come up with. Let's call it Terror. or Horror. A far more apt title would have been 'Home Movie' or 'The Hell Projector', or something vaguely amusing.The jyst of the movie is that a struggling true crime writer, looking for inspiration, moves his entire family into a murder scene house.Really.What kind of PSYCHO would DO that???? They really don't explore that this author must be a frikken SOCIOPATH to even contemplate something like that...And his oh so DUMB WIFE who doesn't figure this out until 3/4 of the way through the movie??? And she doesn't even figure it out, her kids tell her??? The only saving grace to this movie are the home movies themselves. Well filmed on super 8, they convey a real creepiness and add a ton of atmosphere. However, even these little movie in a movie gems are not without their flaws. For example: In one movie, a small girl saws through a foot thick tree limb, with the small saw at the end of a tree pruner (which, for the tool challenged, is meant for TWIGS and SMALL BRANCHES). Oh, and apparently in that same video, this little girl has managed to hog tie and noose up her entire family by herself...This theme continues, and I'm sorry to give away the plot but the plot is so thin you would have to be severely mentally challenged to not get the secret 10 minutes into this movie. NONE of the murders could possibly have been committed by the children.The amusing thing is, they have the perfect plot device to explain why: The children are serving a Dark Sumerian Demon Lord. Oh good! Except that all this supposedly powerful demon lord does is hang out in his scary clown mask and get his jollies watching his demon kids carry out the murders. Why didn't they just show him giving them help to subdue the family? Apparently he just teaches them all how to make, I dunno, foamy Sumerian knock out poison.The ghostly kids, which run around haunting every new house targeted for mass murder, make no sense whatsoever. They are apparently trapped in the Haunted Projector? yet they are not. They apparently fear their demon lord, yet obey his every command. None of this is explained.",6,0,0,5 November 2015
Don't Breathe," A great idea is ruined by disgusting sideways sexual content
","I went into this movie with some hope, as the idea was original, even if a bit hateful towards blind people. This movie starts out great and rapidly devolves into unbelievable land, with unstoppable killer dog, check, unstoppable indestructible psycho killer, check, continuous lethal wounds that seem to do no real damage, to the psycho or the kids, check.Another factor is you really don't know who to root for in this movie. Do I really care that some criminal break in punks are getting their comeuppance? No, kill them all. So the movie suddenly realises this 3/4 of the way in and has to solve it, by somehow making the blind guy super evil. They do this with a disgusting sexual sidebar that makes you literally want to vomit. This movie is all over the map. It wants to be a standard teen slasher movie, but it didn't bring enough disposable teens to be murdered, so it makes them indestructible instead, except for the first token kill. It wants to be a creepy sexual abduction movie, but we don't even get a hint of this direction until the movie is nearly over. I left greatly disappointed and very nauseated.",5,8,16,27 September 2016
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," A fairly good fun ride but definitely NOT as good as #1
","We knew going into this that Rocket and Groot, with strong support from Draxx, would carry this film. We saw that in the trailers, as we saw very important pivotal joke moments ruined for us before we got to see them in the movie. And this all came to pass.Rocket, Groot, and Draxx, do indeed carry this movie, with some minor support from the excellent Michael Rooker character Yondo.Look for Chris Pratt to be pretty much yawning and getting a paycheque in the background, with the complete miscast Kurt Russell and Sylvester Stallone (really???) getting into the franchise and ruining it.Another big disappointment is the main bad guy race. I was a huge fan of the Kree and Ronan the Accuser in Vol 1, and I thought Lee Pace did a fantastic job in that movie.Compare that to what we get in Vol. 2 - Golden Snobs who play video games to attack you with their spacedrones, led by a petulant young queen who struts around in her golden cape pouting at people and things.We have lots of tear jerking in this one too, so thank god for Rocket's smart ass mouth and Draxx's off the wall humor. We have Chris and Gamorra dancing and making googly eyes, we have Gamorra and Nebula making up as sistas, extremely quickly and with no development, and we have the wonderful character of Yondo getting slain as the sacrificial 'good guy death' that we seem to always need in a sequel.AND we see Starlord's classic vintage 80's WALKMAN get destroyed!So in one movie we see THREE of the tentpole structures from the first movie that carried it, namely, the eternal hatred rivalry of Gamorra vs Nebula, the constant threat of the deadly and resourceful scavanger Yondo, and the retro 80's theme of StarLord's ancient WALKMAN and MIX TAPES, all completely DESTROYED!!!!But don't worry, as marketed, BABY GROOT IS CUTE. The number of teenage girls fawning and awwwing over him, including my own daughter, was a tidal wave of vomit all on it's own. Yes, the marketing engineered living Cupie doll was very cute, and pretty much had to carry the movie at points on his tiny leaf sprouting shoulders.But in the end, as one might expect, it was Kurt Russell literally playing GOD, as a planet sized life form that somehow has troubles killing the good guys with his energy tentacles at the end of the movie. It was painful watching Kurt and Chris work through this awful material, even when they were deliberately making fun of it it came off as awkward and awful. We end up wanting to spend the entire movie with Yondo and Rocket in jail, trying to get baby groot to bring them stuff to break out with (the highlight of the movie). We end up feeling like Gamorra when she takes a walk out to the fields away from Kurt's Shangri-La 60's acid trip palace, because, THIS PLANET SUX! Yes it does, Gamorra, wish we could take a walk too.",6,1,3,8 May 2017
Kong: Skull Island," Apocalypse Now with a King Kong
","Here's a tip for keeping me at least interested for a B-grade monster movie. When you take off with 4 huey choppers from the deck of your science ship, please don't almost immediately breed them into 8 choppers. I was looking at the deck, going hmmmmm, small load, they're going to need more against kong... but oh, never mind, they just randomly spawned MORE choppers after take off. Oh good....All eight, plus the other two heavy lift ones, all proceed to get as close as possible to kong's flailing arms, so they can all get crashed. Now, the heavy lift chopper is literally STUFFED with bombs and napalm... yet does not explode when it crashes.The choppers go in to skull island with speakers blaring. Like the rip off of Apocalypse Now could not be any more blatant. Instead of Ride of the Valkryes though, they play Black Sabbath's 'Paranoid', the ONE highlight of this movie.Kong is NOT a giant gorilla, like the excellent Jack Black version of King Kong, the best ever done and never to be topped. No, this guy looks more like a squat short legged sasquatch.This Island should have been called 'The Island of Misfit Monsters', because that's what it was. A gigantic spider with legs designed to look like bamboo??? WHY??? A humongous water buffalo with horns designed to get him stuck in swamps? Tiny bat pterosaurs that can somehow lift a human being and then tear them to pieces in the air? Giant lizards that are missing their back legs?? A random giant squid just hangin' out in a small lake, even though King Kong is clearly only up to his knees in water, and the water is Way to shallow there for a humongous kraken squid, wth, through er in.Then we have John Reilly. As in well known comedian. From such low brow hilarity as step brothers. And he's in fine form, cracking John Reilly step brother jokes ('I may stab you tonight... just kidding...') His character is completely out of place and completely unbelievable. The skipper from Gilligan's Island would have worked better.This is a Vietnam war flick with stupid monsters and King Kong. And that's all it is. The soldiers, after tramping over mountains and through swamps all day, magically produce a flame thrower and a .50 cal machine gun in one battle. Anyone tell the director how heavy those things are and why didn't we see them before? At 2 hours this movie CRAWLS, and it feels like 4. The predictable final show down at the end with Kong facing the BIG legless stupid lizard, is boring and cringe-worthy.Samuel Jackson is also cringe-worthy. A 2D cardboard cut-out character with zero depth, very much played as a Captain Ahab.I can't recommend you dodge this in the theatres enough. And there was Zero 3D in it.",4,4,7,3 April 2017
Arrival," A near flawless old fashioned sci fi movie with smarts
","Arrival plays on our fears, V-style, as 12 incredible ships descend over Earth with no warning. Riots and political instability soon ensue, especially when the general public gets their first look at the aliens, who are Lovecraftian nightmares of tentacles, standing 50 feet tall and bellowing like whales.Initial agreements for world scientists to work together soon give way to distrust as hints emerge the aliens want us to fight each other to the death, for whatever purpose (sport?) they might derive. Soon traditional cold war power blocks circle the wagons and we are approaching WWIII.Flying in to the rescue in true Deus ex Machina style comes our heroine, a wildly implausible yet instantly lovable red head linguist who can predict the future. The aliens teach her how to harness and control her clairvoyance, and the day is saved.Some minor quibbles. Yes this is a 'smart' sci fi movie. This is the Deep Impact version of V, rather than Apocalypse. However, the movie does not delve nearly deep enough into the subject of scientific understanding of alien communications, which they have been studying and theorizing on how to do since the 50's. Witness the Voyager and Pioneer messages, for example. Instead, dummy linguist starts the conversation with 'hello, I'm a HUMAN'. Rather dumbed down. The math wiz in the room, instead of trying PI or the atomic symbol for hydrogen, or perhaps showing a human DNA sequence, just stands there rubbing his head. This movie could have been on scientific par with CONTACT, but they went dumb, I guess to appeal to a wider audience. Another quibble is that the linguist frequently lies about world history, at one point blaming the Germans for Rwanda (it was the FRENCH....) which I'm sure the Germans are quite annoyed by. She also invents a parable to convince the General about the pitfalls of communication, when there are NUMEROUS examples from her studies she could have quoted (the discoverer of CANADA for example named the country when asking the natives 'what is this place' meaning the whole country. The natives replied, 'KANADA' which means, 'this is our village').Finally, this is an intellectual time travel movie, yes, please groan away. It was interesting for sure, but really drags in points. Some limited military actions and perhaps some limited demonstrations of anger from the aliens might have been much more exciting, and still fit within the plot.",8,2,8,15 November 2016
Wonder Woman," Wait... Ares God of War is... wait...
","I am somewhat surprised by the overwhelming female reaction to Gal  Gadot's Wonder Woman, seeing as she is the product of a distraught  1940's shrink and his BDSM fantasy woman, designed to save him from  WWII while domming him with her knee high boots and truth extracting  bondage rope.  Gal G. pulls in a serviceable work on the big WW, bringing the required  'foreign' tang to her, the cheeky hints of sexuality, and leaving the  'Americanized' parts in the garbage where they belong.  Despite the length of this movie, there is precious little time spent  on any 'splainin' to her main sidekick, the very boytoy designed Chris  Pine, who asks painfully few questions and is nearly 100% obsessed with  sex when they are not shooting evil Germans. Why does Diana grow up yet  her other Amazons do not? Why are there no boytoy men as playthings on  the island? Why is their solution to war violence?  I wonder how this movie will play in Germany, who are apparently made  to be evil by a malicious god of war, Ares. German soldiers are  dispatched like cockroaches in short order by our supposed heroine.  We are not told that the British also used poison gas in WWI, and this  is made a strictly German horror, spurred on by a demonic Greek god  hiding in the wings... as David Thewlis.  It's painfully obvious from the moment he starts his 'Chamberlain peace  in our Time' speech that Thewlis is the real evil in sheep's clothing.  However, for some completely bizarre reason, the director KEEPS HIM IN  CHARACTER after he reveals himself as the God of War. So we have a  super powered god of war flying around, with David Thewlis's face and  British accent. It is so cringe-worthy it destroys the entire battle  sequence at the end of the movie.  Amazing fight visuals, the best being WW's attack on a German WWI  trench, and second being the complete slaughter of a poor hapless band  of German shipwreck survivors at the beginning of the movie, who feel  the strange need to fight to the last man against an army of super-  model women, I guess again, because Ares is making them 'evil'.  A strange and not at all well-written movie, and yet, visually a treat.  There you go.",7,3,9,5 June 2017
The Iron Giant," A giant alien robot teaches the value of morality
","This remains my favorite animated movie of all time and survives frequent re-watch.The Iron Giant tells the tale of a giant robotic killing machine that falls to Earth in the paranoid days of 1950's America, after the sputnik launch.Fortunately for the small Maine town, the robot's AI get's scrambled by a bad fall after short-circuiting on eating a power plant.This movie combines the best elements of 1950's giant monster movies, x-files investigations, and good old lessons on morality and the dangers of war and violence.The voice acting in this movie is top shelf, well beyond typical Disney style crap, with Harry Connick Jr, Jennifer Anniston, Vin Diesel, Christopher McDonald, and Eli Marienthal providing stand out performances.Our young red ryder bb gun totin' hero, Hogarth Hughes, must feed and hide his new pet giant alien robot, as a government x-file agent snoops around and government forces close in.The finale is a jaw-dropping War of the Worlds action fest extravaganza, as the robot's lethal AI reactivates briefly due to threats against his new boy master.The animation is incredible, with F-86 Sabres, M-48 tanks, the battleship New Jersey, and the ssbn Nautilus all beautifully rendered in 100% accuracy. The soundtrack is also a treat, with the first half of the movie filled with classic 1950's radio hits, and the last half with menacing sci fi thriller tones that leave you on the edge of your seat.The movie is full of fun developments, like when the child-like giant robot begins to see itself as a copy of Superman after Hogarth reads it comic books in the barn. The robot's true nature however soon becomes apparent when it witnesses hunters shoot and kill a deer, and the automatic programming registers the human guns as a threat.Harry Connic turns in a fantastic performance as the beatnik junkyard collector and artist Dean, and Jennifer Anniston does a fantastic job as Hogarth's overworked but ever doting young mother.",10,1,2,12 June 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," An amazing homage to New Hope
","I was blown away by this movie, despite how obvious this was J.J. Abrams' homage to his love of the original Episode IV, A New Hope:<ul><li>Desert Planet, check. </li></ul><ul><li>Lone poor abandoned character who dreams of the stars. Check. - Droid with secret message. Check. - Evil Darth Vader villain. Check. - Giant Death Star planet killer. Check. - Heroes use Millennium Falcon as their ride. Check. - Only hope is a desperate attack on the giant death star with x-wings, flying down a crevice/tunnel too, while heroes battle it out on station. Check.</li></ul>Then we get his echoes of other movies. Ice Planet. Check. Confrontation on precarious bridge over a giant chasm, between father and son. Check.So, with all my negative points above, you'd think I'd HATE this thing.But I didn't.Adam Driver needed to KEEP HIS MASK ON, for god's sake! He is WAY TOO PRETTY for an evil villain! CUT YOUR DAMN HAIR!!!!And newbie kids figure out lightsabre dueling in five minutes. I'm an experienced swordsman and I'm sorry. That's just bat terd crazy.I was also HUGELY DISAPPOINTED in how they treated Captain Fasma. Here is a brilliant actress, hugely hounorable and respected in GOT, hugely talented with weapons, and apparently so was Captain Fasma. But instead you have her whimperingly lowering her own base's shields with a vague threat, and then thrown ignomiously into a trash compactor. REALLY??? I hope she refuses to do another movie for you.But I loved Rey, despite her obvious parallels to Luke. Her acting was phenomenal, as was Finn, the stormtrooper with a heart of gold. Po Dameron was an excellent hero character and I'm glad they resurrected him.Loved lil' BB-8, more than R2-D2, and wish they had taken him along as their sidekick at the end of the movie. C-3PO just seemed old hat and was annoying.Seeing Chewie with major parts, and how babyish he is when injured, was awesome.My favorite part was Finn, with his buddy's bloody handprint on his mask, stumbling around the battlefield in horror. Never done before in Star Wars. They personalized the stormtroopers. Awesome.Some of the x-wing battle flight scenes were crazy good. Wanted more.The 3D was pointless, until the Star Destroyer was hovering in the theatre over me, then I was blown away and tried to touch it's nose.Killing Han was HORRIFIC!!!! But necessary, and likely the only reason he agreed to do the movie. WHY OH WHY couldn't they have killed Leia too? Good God. What is wrong with her mouth?Really, really wish they had chopped Adam Driver up into little eenie weeenie bits. He just doesn't work with the mask off. He is NO Darth Vader, but he was at least half that with his mask on. With it off, he just transformed into Severus Snape, was waiting for a potion to come out from under his cloak. Terrible choice for his character.",9,16,29,21 December 2015
Life," The Blob Meets Alien
","This is a movie about the crew of the ISS analyzing Mars samples and discovering they contain life, which quickly grows into a blob- starfish creature that is virtually indestructible.If you've seen The Blob, where the small little blob get's on someone's hand and eats merrily away until it's bigger, that's your first half of movie. Second half is an Alien like movie with astronauts alternatively running from or hunting the starfish blob as it grows larger and larger.Unfortunately, this is on the ISS, which has been enhanced and made MUCH bigger than it really is, but the movie still feels like five college kids trying to deal with a badger that got on the school bus. The station is MUCH too small for this type of movie, which is why they set the original Alien on a gigantic space mining ship.Other reviewers have ripped this movie a new one with all of the plot holes, bad writing, and faulty logic in this one.Ryan Renolds appears to have wanted ten mins cash and is in the movie for that long it seems, quickly dying off. Unfortunately, his positive, wise-cracking character, who quickly realizes first that studying alien life on a tiny space station is just plain STUUUUpid, but nobody listens, is the highlight of the movie...Jake G. does his usual bare acting capability and comes across as a PTSD Iraq war medic stuck on the station to keep him away from humans and reduce his VA payments. He is brooding, depressed, moody, and drags the movie down.The creature is most believable and scary as an infant, and quickly as it grows becomes a badly done cgi mess that is not believable and inconsistent.A final note, this movie was made several years after a Russian cosmonaut on the ISS declared they had discovered unknown life living on the outside of one of the ISS windows.... yet no mention is made of this, either in the beginning or in the credits. Nice waste of a real-life tie-in!",5,0,2,19 June 2017
