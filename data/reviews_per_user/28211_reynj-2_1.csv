Casablanca," Rick is the essence of cool
","Stars, story, emotion, one-liners, music, acting--it's all there. This is one of the best movies of all time and a must see. Bogart is Rick, the coolest bar owner in the world. Bergman is Ilsa, who almost causes Rick to lose that cool. What a cast, what a movie!",10,1,1,17 January 2001
