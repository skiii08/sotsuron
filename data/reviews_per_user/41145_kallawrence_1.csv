Child 44," This is must see- for most
","I just so much got into the story. Actually IT is also well directed and made. My own mother is adopted from Sovjet orphanage. What she remembers is fighting for food, she had to swallow IT before all was taken by others, bigger kids. Many and oh much more we ever will know happened then at these terrible times. I liked the way movie was made. IT felt truthful. Recommended. Gave me sense of honesty.",9,0,1,5 January 2019
