It," I like IT...
","Both the children and Pennywise are convincing in their portrayal and captivate the viewer. It's not a horror film, no, but when the clown appears, it's quite possible that the blood in your veins freezes. The rest of the film is a wonderful coming-of-age Story, giving each of the children their own deserved screen time.",9,2,3,3 October 2017
Alien," The Perfect Organism
","I saw the movie for the first time when I was 15 years old. Never before I had such a succinct experience in a film and in the following days I have drawn only Giger's perfect creature, over and over again. Today, 16 years later, I consider Alien to be one of the best Sci-Fi movies of all time and Giger's perfect organism for a masterpiece that had to be created. Without him I would not feel the same great love for Sci-Fi, as i do now. A masterpiece in every way!",9,0,1,6 October 2017
