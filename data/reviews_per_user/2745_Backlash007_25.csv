The Blair Witch Project," 'Have you ever heard of the Blair Witch?'
","'In October of 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland, while shooting a documentary.  A year later their footage was found.' That is the making of a scary, intense, and sometimes even funny film.  The Blair Witch Project's notorious reputation precedes it and makes it quite possibly the most infamous movie ever produced.  It's also one of the most cheaply made, highest grossing, most parodied films of all time.  Most of those statements are made because of pure marketing genius.  The concept isn't quite as original as you'd like to believe.  It has been done before, but I don't think it has worked before.  Blair Witch 'borrows' the mockumentary concept of The Last Broadcast and improves upon it three-fold. It's a great story with real characters in a real situation and how they deal with it.  It's all about realism.  To this very day, some people believe this actually happened.  I think that's where the hatred comes from; people don't like to be tricked.  Love it or hate it, you can't forget it. The Blair Witch Project IS a landmark horror film.",Null,3,5,24 February 2003
Underworld," 'The lycan hoard scattered to the wind in a single evening of flame and retribution.'
","~Spoiler~Underworld was something that seemed to split audiences.  The horror fans I know hated it, but the action fans I know loved it.  I think it's a splendid hybrid, much like the Blade films.  I dug it.  And I appreciated the fact that they attempted to do most of the effects the old fashioned way.  The CGI was kept to a minimum...believe it or not.  Too bad most of what gets remembered is the bad CGI.  Everyone knows the plot by now: vampires vs. werewolves.  It's a set-up that I'm surprised hasn't been used more often. When I first heard the announcement for the movie I was rooting for the werewolves.  They are my favorite classic monster and the ones in this film look very cool.  The vamps are no pushovers either.  The film had a lot of actors I didn't recognize and a director I had never heard of.  So I didn't know what to expect from those departments and was also pleasantly surprised.  Despite all of this, it's the movies' mythology that made me like it so much.  The history between the lycans and the vamps was just too good.  It gave me a deeper appreciation for the film.  My favorite scene is when Raze (who is given story credit and has an amazing voice) is running towards Viktor and he grabs his throat and stops him like he was a paperweight.  It was awesomely shocking.  I'm looking forward to a sequel and maybe even a prequel if they should decide to make one.",Null,0,0,16 April 2004
Blade," 'The world you live in is just a sugar-coated topping.'
","How do you make a good comic book movie?  Pick one that few people read so the expectations won't be incredibly high.  Then you absolutely blow the audience away with a perfect blend of horror and action.  Blade is the film that proves Wesley Snipes is truly a badass.  Just take a look at that fan-freakin-tastic opening sequence.  It's fast paced and throws you right into the action of the Daywalker's world.  Stephen Norrington definitely has a unique visual style.  The film has a certain look to it that is highly original.  He makes good use out of his cast as well.  Besides the obvious (Snipes being a badass), Stephen Dorff is awesome as Deacon Frost.  'We're the top of the f***ing food chain.'  Kris Kristofferson also surprised the hell out of me in this role.  He's a very good actor, and likeable to boot. Genre legend Udo Kier puts in an appearance as well, albeit a brief one. One of my favorite performances comes from the comic relief of Donal Logue. The man is hilarious.  The climax is equally as cool as the beginning showing the souls escaping the vampire hierarchy.  It's a great effect.  It shows that David Goyer has come a long way as a screenwriter since Death Warrant and Demonic Toys.  All this make Blade recommended viewing and one helluva ride.  Check out the sequel as well.",Null,0,1,4 November 2002
The Others," 'Are you mad? I am your daughter.'
","~Spoiler~ Alejandro Amenabar's The Others is a film that I feel is a bit overrated, but still a good movie. It's The Innocents meets The Sixth Sense and I have to say that I enjoyed it the first time that I watched it. However, it does not hold up to multiple viewings (much like most movies with a so-called 'twist'). While I like it for bringing that old Hollywood class back to the genre, not a whole lot ever happens during the film. And that really hurts when you are watching it a second time. You know what is going on so any interest is gone and there's really no more fun in viewing it. The film in a nutshell is about a family of three living in a secluded mansion that may or may not be haunted. Are there ghosts, or is the Mother losing her mind. You can tell the film was heavily influenced by The Innocents in that regard. Nicole Kidman is perfect here as the mother, but it is the children that really shine. I'm surprised to see that at this time they haven't worked much after this film. The ending may surprise some, but others will recognize what's going on. It's a good ending, but it's been used to death by now. I would urge everyone to see The Others once, but only once.",Null,5,9,1 April 2007
Sleepy Hollow," 'It is a place called Sleepy Hollow.'
","~Spoiler~Sleepy Hollow marks the third time Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have worked together and I have to say it's their best collaboration. Burton's take on the the Washington Irving classic is a terrific slice of American Gothic. I'm sure everyone knows the tale of Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman, but this movie offers up a new mythos for the iconic duo. This ain't exactly your daddy's Sleepy Hollow. But don't let that stop you from seeing this exceptional film. The cast and art direction alone are worth the price of entry. Johnny Depp is of course the star and Christina Ricci is the love interest, while a combination of Christopher Walken and Ray Park are the Headed/Headless Horseman. Miranda Richardson, Ian McDiarmid, Michael Gough, Michael Gambon, Casper Van Dien, Jeffrey Jones, Christopher Lee, and Martin Landau are just some of fantastic character actors you will see. Along with a talented cast, the film is just visually pleasing. The picture is so monochromatic it may as well have been shot in black and white; which suits the atmosphere perfectly. I wouldn't say that Burton has ever made an out and out horror film, but this is definitely his closest.",Null,1,2,21 December 2008
Top Secret!," 'What funny duck poop?'
","Top Secret is one of the funniest, most off-the-wall movies ever filmed. Featuring a young Val Kilmer, I think Top Secret is the best of all spoof films (Spaceballs is a close second).  This thing spoofs everything, Beach Boy's songs, spy pictures, war movies, westerns, and even Elvis is not safe. It's ridiculous, outrageous, hilarious, and all in the name of good fun. The spit gag has to be my favorite bit.  You've seen it in countless movies: the hero is being verbally accosted by the villain and he spits in his face. This time, however, the hero is on the other side of the room.  Other memorable jokes include the skeet songs, the anal intruder, the 'cow' scenes, and the backwards bit with Peter Cushing.  There are countless little things like that which make Top Secret a definite cult classic and a certifiable must-see.'Wish they all could be double barrel, wish they all could be double barrel guuuuuuuns.'",Null,98,118,26 August 2003
Predator," 'What's the matter Dillon? The CIA got you pushing too many pencils?'
","I love Predator.  My mom loves Predator.  Everyone loves Predator.  Predator is one of those great and genuine movies that simply entertains.  In fact, it's one of the most entertaining films ever made.  When watching the movie you're really watching two movies; a Sci-fi epic on one hand and a kick-ass commando action/adventure on the other.  And there's never a dull moment.  I don't have one complaint about the film.  The cast is perfect.  From the sexual Tyrannosaurus Jesse 'the body' Ventura to Carl 'Apollo Creed' Weathers to 70's porn star Sonny Landham, they're all great.  This is one of Arnold's best roles, no doubt.  And I can't say enough about the predator itself.  But the design they used was not the original.  I saw the AMC backstory about the film and caught a glimpse of the original monster (played by none other than Jean Claude Van Damne).  It would not have worked, believe me.  It just would not have been scary.  My hat is off to Stan Winston for saving the film.  He created one of the scariest, and most creative monsters in recent film history.  A brilliant cast, an excellent score, fast-paced direction, and a memorable creature make Predator a true classic.Note for horror buffs:  Shane Black who plays Hawkins wrote the Monster Squad.",Null,0,0,3 March 2002
Pitch Black," 'You're not afraid of the dark are you?'
","~Spoiler~ Pitch Black is essentially an Aliens rip-off done the right way, with style and flare and balls.  I say hell yeah.  Director David Twohy (writer of Warlock and Critters 2) has created a sci-fi/horror film with more than a few tricks up its sleeve.  In the first ten minutes it sinks its teeth into you.  By the end of the film, you're left wanting more.  Twohy manages to surprise me on a number of occasions.  The characters are the main surprise. They are unusual for a sci-fi flick, and they change throughout the movie. Our hero is, in fact, an evil man.  Who we think at first is our hero is also an evil man.  And our heroine almost killed everyone at the beginning of the movie.  Everyone is non-traditional and the actors are integral in making it all believable.  A pre-action stardom Vin Diesel is amazing in this role.  If they make a sequel to this (and make it right) Richard Riddick could be his Mad Max.  Cole Hauser is also good as his equal (if you could say he has an equal).  Hauser pulls off a great flip-flop in the duration of the movie and you end up really hating his character.  Radha Mitchell is also fine as our heroine.  She's not overly-beautiful and you can believe she is a pilot.  And the always great Keith David plays a unique part: he's a Muslim.  How often do you see a Muslim character in an outer space flick?  The plot is asking a bit much out of the audience but just go with it.  There's a desert planet inhabited by aliens who are light-sensitive that's surrounded by three suns and every 22 years an eclipse occurs allowing the aliens full reign.  Our players have crash landed just in time for said eclipse (yeah, it's reaching a bit).  Take that for granted and watch the characters, and for 'Riddick Vision.'  How cool is that?  The aliens are not bad, but it's the cinematography that makes the film a bit creepy.  The colors and tones of the picture are absolutely beautiful.  Twohy definitely has his own style and I'm looking forward to seeing more of his work.  Perhaps the best reason for watching this movie is that it meets an old Joe Bob Briggs' standard: 'Anyone can die at any time.' If you loved Alien/Aliens and want to see a different spin on an old formula, check out Pitch Black.",Null,0,0,10 March 2003
American Psycho," 'I'm into uh...murders and executions mostly.'
","~Spoiler~American Psycho is best described by its title. Christian Bale stars as Patrick Bateman, a man with wealth, looks, and charm...a vision of the American dream. Or is he the American nightmare? You see, he just can't get that reservation at Dorsia. Also, his business card isn't as impressive because he didn't go with the eggshell white. This is a film that I initially found a bit disturbing and did not care for at all. Upon revisiting it, however, American Psycho has hit an unexpected place: my funny bone. This is one of the most quotable movies ever and I can't believe how funny it is. I guess the first time I watched I didn't get it for what it was: a satire. It's a satirical look at the materialism and excess of the 80's and I had not seen Oliver Stone's Wall Street before viewing American Psycho. Wall Street was the key to unlocking this movie for me. Sounds weird, doesn't it? But I swear that's what did it for me. Well, that and my love for Huey Lewis and the News. The film is packed with a star-studded cast, but it's Bale who makes a name for himself here. He is the whole show. If you are a fan of his, I suggest seeing this film as you will see a much different side of the actor. Or, if you thought Genesis was too artsy before the presence of Phil Collins became more apparent, then American Psycho is for you too. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to return some videotapes.",Null,2,3,29 December 2008
Van Helsing," 'My life... my job... my curse... is to vanquish evil.'
","Van Helsing is what happens when Stephen Sommers, whose successful re-imagining of the Mummy made a lot of money, decides to do an update of some more Universal favorites. This time Dracula, The Wolf Man, and Frankenstein. Van Helsing is a film of ups and downs. I really loved the black and white beginning. It was a nice homage to James Whale's Frankenstein. I kind of wanted the whole film to look like that. And then I hate the introduction of Van Helsing as he fights The Hulk, oops, I mean Mr. Hyde. What I truly despise about Van Helsing is all the terrible CGI. I remember a time when all make-up effects were practical, and they looked believable. Remember American Werewolf in London, The Howling, and even the original Wolf Man? Something real is far more terrifying than some obvious computer effect. It takes you right out of the movie. Mr Hyde, the Werewolf, and Dracula all looked terrible in my opinion and I long for the day when filmmakers realize that too. But I think Sommers did the best job he could with intertwining all of the story lines without altering too much of the original mythos. That was a real plus. And of course the acting was fine. Hugh Jackman is always really good, Kate Beckinsale is wonderful, Richard Roxburgh may have been a bit over the top but it was that kind of role, and Kevin J. O'Connor does what he does best. O'Connor's Igor was one of the characters I was most impressed with. He was like a wicked combination of Dwight Frye and Skeletor. The whole time I was watching Van Helsing I was thinking I would have really enjoyed this if I were a kid. This is the closest thing to The Monster Squad I've seen for the younger generation. While not a complete waste of time, it would be a better starter kit for young ones interested in horror.",Null,2,4,2 January 2005
Dark City," 'First came darkness...then came the Strangers.'
","~Spoiler~Dark City is a fantastic thriller with a tinge of horror, a dash of mystique, and a tragic science fiction tale. In Dark City, Alex Proyas once again brings his dark cinematic vision to life. He creates a world unlike any other, a zoo in which the strangers study and change our memories. That's all of the plot I'll give away because the less you know about the film the better it is. It's a purely original and entertaining film. The cast does a fantastic job as well. Richard O'Brien is truly creepy and Kiefer Sutherland goes through an amazing transformation in this movie. He proves that he is a versatile actor. But it's the visual effects that stun me the most, they're extraordinary (must see to believe). Dark City is an unusual, beautifully dark film that should be seen by all. Now Sleep.",Null,0,2,20 January 2002
The Machinist," 'If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist.'
","The Machinist is the new thriller from director Brad Anderson and manages to pack in a few surprises. The first surprise is Christian Bale's dedication. He plays a machinist who could be losing his mind due to chronic insomnia. He claims he hasn't slept in a year. Bale lost a reported 63 pounds for the role! His screen appearance is startling. Remember Stephen King's Thinner? Well Bale's using no make-up and he achieves a similar look as the main character in Thinner. It's astounding and disturbing at the same time. The second thing that surprised me was the script. When the writing credit crept on screen I thought 'Scott Kosar...isn't that the go-to remake guy?' He penned the new take on The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (and he's redoing The Amityville Horror next). This film is a long way off from that one. I guess Ben Affleck was right. You do the safe picture, then you do the art picture. The Machinest is a nice quiet pace for a change, without all the choppy editing tricks. I like those kinds of films when the slow pace builds a good tension and the payoff is made tenfold better. However, I felt the payoff here was a bit disappointing. I had ideas as to what was going on but kept saying to myself 'This film will rise above that.' Well, it didn't. I was expecting something truly astounding at the end to knock my socks off. I guess M. Night Shamalyan can be blamed for that one. But Anderson's own Session 9 left me wanting more immediately and I over-hyped myself for his next outing. Regardless of what I see as flaws, the film looked breathtakingly beautiful and I'll be watching out for Brad Anderson's next film. I just won't let the hype get to me.",Null,1,1,24 April 2005
Resident Evil," 'The Dead Walk!'
","~Spoiler~Resident Evil, when you get down to it, is a well-crafted piece of horror. It's my favorite scary movie to come out of theaters in a long while, no teenie-bopper s**t here, just pure horror.  The atmosphere and infectious score are second to none.  I love the small glimpse we get of the mansion, with the blowing leaves and evil crows.  It's also very claustrophobic at times and those are often the best horror films.  Paul Anderson's direction is perfect and he succeeds in doing justice to the video game.  The opening of the film is so tense (the elevator scene especially) I had to remind myself to breathe.  There were some other scenes where I just wanted to jump in and start whippin' some zombie tale.  The dog's were incredible and the train sequence was straight out of Resident Evil 2.  The in-joke was also great ('Where'd all the bodies go?').  Upon viewing the trailer, the fight scenes looked very anime-esque.  I didn't think it was going to work. However, the flipping kicks and snapping necks make Resident Evil quite original.  It is easily comparable to a few other films though (but I'm not upset about this fact).  First off is the hallway scene with the lasers. Someone watched Cube before designing that sequence.  And then there's the bigger comparison:  Aliens.  Both films share basically the same plot, with a strong female lead, but who cares.   The only things that don't sit right with me are the all-too-obvious CG Licker and the character of Kaplan; after all the crap he suffered through, that poor guy deserved to live.  Those things don't take too much away from the film however.  Resident Evil is an exceptional addition to the zombie genre and a great theater experience (I have not had an adrenaline rush like this since seeing Event Horizon, another Anderson classic). Can't wait for a sequel.Note for genre buffs:  The newspaper at the end of the film reading 'The Dead Walk!' is an obvious reference to George A. Romero's classic Day of the Dead.  Also, Jason Isaacs (Event Horizon) has a great cameo in the film.",Null,1,1,25 August 2002
Alien vs. Predator," 'You're one ugly mother...'
","~Spoiler~Where's the rest of the line? Oh, I forgot the movie was rated PG-13. You weren't aiming to please, were you guys? Well, let's have a little backstory on the film's director: Paul WS Anderson. He upset a lot fans with his film version of Mortal Kombat but I didn't care because I didn't like Mortal Kombat. He upset a lot of fans with his film version of Resident Evil but I didn't care because I will take a theatrical zombie film any way I can get it. But, it would seem my time has come. It was time for Paul WS Anderson to upset me by screwing up classic science-fiction icons that I have grown up with. Let's start with the characters, what characters? This movie had NO character development whatsoever. What's so great about the Alien and Predator series' were that we always had characters that we cared about; Dutch and his commandos, Ripley and her crew, Hicks and his space marines. I had little to no interest in any character in 'AVP.' The only plus was the appearance by Lance Henriksen, and he was barely in the movie. The pen trick he did was a nice touch, but hardly makes me forgive anything else. Next we have the setting: the Arctic. Apparently it's not as cold as I was led to believe in the arctic. People are just walking around nonchalantly for long periods at a time (some without coats) and I don't even think you could see their breath. Way to go. Now, and this is the biggest no-no, the mythology. They messed with the mythology. The aliens gestate in mere minutes it would now seem whereas it used to take hours. Also, the aliens grow to full size in a matter of minutes now. Yay. And they made the Predators seem very weak to me. I was waiting for Busta Rhymes to jump out and start whipping them just like he did Michael Myers in Halloween Resurrection. Now let's examine that atrocious final shot, you know, the one with the 'predalien.' How could it be half predator and half alien? We've seen the alien gestate in humans, we've even seen it gestate in dogs, and it never burst out with a nose or whiskers or any other attribute that didn't belong to it. So why now? On that note I will stop (although I could go on). This is the worst theatrical horror or sci-fi film I've seen since Dreamcatcher. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. Oh, the wasted potential!",Null,0,0,26 September 2004
28 Days Later...," 'If you look at the whole life of the planet, we, you know, man, has only been around for a few blinks of an eye. So if the infection wipes us all out, that is a return to normality. '
","~Spoiler~ How is it that a movie can have such critical success, and yet horror fans are not pleased?  How is this film so incredibly different from Romero's own zombie films.  Yes, I'm aware that it's not a zombie film (regardless of what the back of the DVD claims) but it still parallels the classics.  28 Days Later reminded me so much of Dawn/Day of the Dead that I had to love it.  The scene where they enter a supermarket and go on a shopping spree: Dawn of the Dead.  The scene with Mailer, an infected soldier, chained to a wall: Day of the Dead.  Jim killing the kid at the gas station: more Dawn. The evil military: more Day.  I for one loved this movie.  I dug it mainly because it had solid characters, characters I cared about in a horrific situation.  Jim is the everyman.  He's a character that every person should be able to identify with.  Jim awakes from a coma to find his world empty. Or so he thinks.  A rage virus has overcome the city of London (perhaps more) and it has left infected, zombie-like creatures in its wake.  The virus is in the blood; one bite or scratch and it's curtains for you.  Jim is played brilliantly by Cillian Murphy (Jeremy Sisto's English cousin??). I hope to see more of this young actor.  The rest of the cast is perfect as well.  Naomie Harris IS her character, Christopher Eccleston and Brenden Gleesen are incredible as well, and this is only Megan Burns' second film. Plus, the film had an undeniably 'real life' feel to it.  I believe this situation is possible. And that scares me.  This film hit theaters during the SARS epidemic and that only adds to the chilling and effective atmosphere the movie creates.  The digital filmmaking also adds to this sense of realism and compliments the film magically.  Another thing going for it was the empty city of London.  I could keep going with what I feel are 'positives' but let me talk about questions that the film has raised. One such question is if the Rage Virus causes uncontrollable anger, then why don't the infected kill each other?  Why didn't Romero's zombie attack each other?  The infected 'recognize' one another (perhaps through pheromones or maybe just animal instincts) and have a strong to desire to spread the virus.  The virus is trying its best to survive (like any living creature) and the infected attacking the infected would be pointless.  That's the best explanation that I could come up with.  I think Danny Boyle (who impressed me more with Shallow Grave) and Alex Garland did a hell of a job on this thing.",Null,1,1,2 November 2003
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," 'Stars!'
","~Spoiler~ Resident Evil: Apocalypse starts off pretty strong...and then goes WAY downhill. The beginning is really atmospheric with everyone trying to get out of Raccoon City. Mobs of people are waiting at the gates of the city but no one is allowed to leave. The city has been quarantined and the zombie plaque quickly reaches the gates. It's like actually seeing the scene that Mark describes in 28 Days Later. There was also a severely claustrophobic scene where a woman is running up a flight of stairs with a gang of bloodthirsty zombies on her heels. It was an effective moment to say the least. However, the flick enters ridiculous territory pretty damn quick. Bad elements include, but aren't limited to, terrible CGI monsters, comic relief by Mike Epps, Milla Jovovich running down a building, and the Nemesis himself. I read tons of interviews where the creators claimed the Nemesis would be the next horror icon. Sorry guys, it ain't happening. Perhaps my biggest peev with the film is the obligatory to be continued ending. I'm really not interested in a Resident Evil 3. Paul W.S. Anderson obviously just belted this script out super-quick so he could go ruin other franchises. So, sadly, the best thing about this film was the teaser trailer that looked like an actual ad for the Umbrella Corporation (done by Texas Chainsaw redux helmer Marcus Nispel). They should have just based this on the Resident Evil 2 video game.",Null,1,2,20 February 2005
The Evil Dead," 'Ever-present, ever-listening.'
","Stephen King has called it 'the ultimate experience in grueling terror.' It certainly lives up to and exceeds that. The Evil Dead is one of the greatest and funniest horror pictures ever made and an inspiration to filmmakers everywhere. It's an undisputed classic. Shot in 1979, it's still just as effective today. The gallons of blood, the flying body parts, the evil laughter, it's all in good fun. And, yet, it's all horrific. The movie works so well largely because of four factors: the genius of Rob Tapert, the stylish direction of Sam Raimi, the crude make-up of Tom Sullivan, and the facial expressions of Bruce Campbell. Everything is forced to blend together seamlessly. It's all beautifully and brilliantly done. The Evil Dead is a cult favorite for a reason.

From Dusk Till Dawn," 'Okay hard drinkers, lets drink hard.'
","From Dusk Till Dawn is a kick-ass, rock-n-roll horror flick.  It's also entertaining as all hell, starting off as a tale of two criminals, the Gecko brothers, who have just busted out of jail, pulled a bank job, and are headed for the border.  It has the making to be a great action/crime thriller and then, out of nowhere, vampires start coming out of the woodwork and the s**t hits the fan.  And when the s**t hits the fan, the s**t hits the fan!  It's not quite what I expected from Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino.  I expected a smart, edgy Pulp Fiction-esque horror film.  What I got was a big budget gorefest.  It's truly unbelievable.  I had lost all faith in Hollywood horror but this was a godsend; Body parts fly, eyeballs explode, blood gushes everywhere, and 'anyone can die at any time' to quote Joe Bob Briggs.  Two of the biggest names in Hollywood (Rodriguez and Q. T.) turned into kids in a candy shop when they got there hands into horror.  And the product of that was a mean motor scooter of a movie with an A-list cast. George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino define cool.  Harvey Keitel is always great and Juliette Lewis...well Juliette Lewis still gets on my last nerve. The supporting cast is awesome, including Salma Hayek, Danny Trejo, Fred Williamson, Michael Parks, Kelly Preston, and even horror veteran John Saxon.  Cheech Marin takes on three roles in the film:  a border patrol officer, a vampire, and a Mexican crime boss.  His speech is a classic, you'll know what I mean.  With all these great names, make-up and effects master Tom Savini still scored the best part in the movie:  Sex Machine, the fearless vampire killer with his bull-whip and back-flips.  Let me get back to the gore for a minute.  This is a gorehounds dream come true.  The non-stop gore onslaught doesn't start until an hour in, but it's well worth the wait.  There are plenty of scenes that are unforgettable, but the coolest part has got to be the vampire band.  It's a crude and cool horror film that you have to see to believe.  From Dusk Till Dawn can be summed up in one word:  fun.",Null,0,0,7 April 2002
Grindhouse," 'A white-hot juggernaut at 200 miles per hour!'
","Since I grew up in the 80's I never got to experience the 'Grindhouse' era. I missed out on the sleazy, sensational, and the over-the-top sex and violence that exploitation films had to offer on the big screen. Imagine then, my pleasure when Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino announced that they were going to make an exploitive double feature and call it Grindhouse. Each would direct a full length picture and have fellow artists make faux trailers to complete the experience. I was delirious with anticipation. April 6th couldn't arrive fast enough. Well, April 6th has passed and you're probably wondering how the films measured up. Grindhouse may be the best experience I've ever had going to the movies. The minute that familiar music cues up announcing the coming attractions I had a smile plastered to my face until the last credit rolled (and, to be honest, a long time after that). The adventure begins with a fake trailer showcasing Rodriguez regular Danny Trejo. It's a classic revenge movie called Machete and it sets the bar high for what's to come. Then RR's feature begins to roll: Planet Terror. It opens big too. You know you are in for an all-out horror epic from the get-go. The military is at it again with a biological warfare agent that turns ordinary citizens into blood thirsty 'sickos.' It's basically a non-zombie zombie movie with great characters and gallons of the gooey stuff. I won't say anything else about the plot, other than strap in and enjoy the ride. What I will talk about are the actors in this segment. Rodriguez has hired everyone from up-and-comers to B-movie vets and they're all up for the task. Let me rattle off the names and say that I was impressed with everyone: Michael Biehn, Jeff Fahey, Freddy Rodriguez, Rose McGowan, Tom Savini, Michael Parks (as Texas Ranger Earl McGraw), Josh Brolin, Marley Shelton, Naveen Andrews, Bruce Willis, Stacy Ferguson, Nicky Katt, and El Mariachi himself Carlos Gallardo. That's an impressive cast! By the end of this feature you will be on a high high. Even though there is a lot of purposeful print damage and even a missing reel to give it the feel of the period, I think Planet Terror owes more to 80's gore and silliness than the 70's. But that's where Tarantino comes in (which I'll get to after a few short 'prevues'). To bridge the gap we have some more highly entertaining fake trailers. First up, Rob Zombie tackles the Nazi sub-genre with Werewolf Women of the S.S. The title pretty much says it all. He's brought with him his usual cast of 'rejects' along with Udo Kier and the resurrected Sybil Danning. Nic Cage also pops up as Fu Manchu! Then we have the Edgar Wright directed Don't. Don't is a take-off of the British, Gothic chiller and the narration is the best part. Finally, we have Eli Roth's Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving, the slasher movie that is long overdue, was my favorite of the coming attractions. It perfected the look of those old trailers: the graininess, the deep-throated narration, and the sick humor. This leads into Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof. Get comfortable because the pace slows down a bit. I thought QT did a great job of capturing the essence of the era and what makes those flicks irresistible. Like so many of those films, it was a slow build to a memorable climax. If Planet Terror is a rock-n-roll induced, Italian influenced Nightmare City apocalypse, then Death Proof is a bizarre, American gem you'd likely find hiding on one of those public domain DVD's that's been abandoned for years yearning for an audience. In Death Proof, the inimitable Kurt Russell stars as Stuntman Mike. He's got a thing for the ladies but it's not altogether healthy: he kills them with his suped up, 100% death proof, hot rod. The scenes that had the most impact with me were the deaths of the girls. These scenes are brutal. Especially after you have spent time with their characters and QT gets you to like them. It's straight out of Psycho, but it's still unexpected and highly effective. Tarantino lulls you into a safe zone with his usual pop culture banter (he's captured some really good chick dialogue here) and then BAM!!! You're looking at roadkill chili at 200 miles an hour! Stuntman Mike is a creepy, cool character who is very badass and manly when he's the hunter. But when the shoe is on the other foot, he turns into the biggest wuss. This was a character arc that I really haven't seen too often and I thought it was fun. His next group of intended victims give Stuntman Mike something to remember them by. Again, this cast is superb. With Russell in the driver's seat, all of 'the girls' are wonderful. The real surprise standouts are Zoe Bell (playing herself) and Vanessa Ferlito. I have only one problem with Death Proof. It should have played first in the double bill. A lot of people are hating on it and I think it's because Planet Terror is such a roller coaster ride and Death Proof takes a longer time to get going. The pace is a bit more uneven here, but I don't think people would have cared if it was the first feature. As much as I loved Grindhouse, the average movie-going public is not ready for this film. You have to understand B-movie logic and have a working knowledge of exploitation cinema to really 'get it.' Hell, some people walked out after Planet Terror ended because they didn't know there was a second feature. I heard some people grumbling 'How does she fire her machine gun leg?' The answer is that it doesn't matter because it's a tribute to B-movies. That's why film geeks are loving it while the average Joe and Joann are left shaking their heads. While both films may be considered 'flawed', the experience itself was beyond perfection.",Null,1,6,9 April 2007
Army of Darkness," 'Hail to the King, baby.'
","Listen up, you primitive screwheads. This is the last installment (for now) of the Evil Dead trilogy, the greatest trilogy known to man. Bruce Campbell once again takes on his defining role of Ash, the beloved idiot and Deadite a$$ kicker. In AOD, you'll follow Ash on many a misadventure, as he is thrown into the Dark Ages and must quest for the Necronomicon. Army of Darkness is a great horror/comedy. So many scenes are standouts I can't just focus on one. You have to see this movie. It's one of the most thoroughly entertaining flicks ever. There's something in it for everyone, especially the B-horror buff. Its got action, adventure, romance, humor, and horror. Plus, it's got Bruce Campbell. The man is hilarious. It's worth buying just to see all of his facial expressions and hear all of his one-liners. Seek out this movie. And remember, 'Shop smart. Shop S-Mart.' Note to genre buffs: Sam and Ted Raimi have cameos. Bill Moseley and Patricia Tallman (both from the NOTLD '90) also have cameos. The original ending was actually filmed in the batcave from the old Adam West series.",10,8,14,24 September 2001
Halloween," Haddonfield, Illinois
","When you think of horror, certain images come to mind: Jason Voorhees, Fred Krueger, Leatherface, and (perhaps most importantly, at least to me) Michael Myers. Halloween is a classic movie and a favorite among horror fans everywhere. Plus it scared the hell out of me when I was younger. There's something oddly scary about a guy running around in a William Shatner mask killing teens. I get chills every single time I hear Donald Pleasence utter the lines: 'He's gone from here. The evil is gone.' Pleasence should be revered as one of the greats, sitting alongside Price, Cushings, and Lee. His absence is the reason that H2O never sat right with me. When he died, the series sort of died. But the first Halloween will always be immortal. As will Pleasence's performance. The atmosphere and music, especially the music, really add to the fear effect. Myers is extremely creepy himself. The mute, breathing of Myers is far scarier than any visual in any horror film. His silence is eerie. And that is why Michael Myers will always remain my favorite slasher. 'You can't kill the Boogeyman!'",Null,0,0,31 October 2001
A Nightmare on Elm Street," 'Don't... fall... asleep!'
","Wow, I had forgotten how good this movie is.  A Nightmare on Elm Street is truly genre re-defining.  It broke the rules of the usual slasher flick and put the dream stipulation into place.  And it's unpredictable for its time. It's crazy to me that Wes Craven could have conjured up the concept of this movie and it's characters considering his strict, no movies allowed, Christian background.  But maybe that is why it is so good.  Freddy is really scary and the teenager as well as the adult characters feel very real.  Craven outdone himself on this film.  In fact, I don't think he has or ever will again upstage A Nightmare on Elm Street.  I love The People Under the Stairs and Shocker, and Scream was good (although it was not good for the genre.  I hate the fact that it destroyed horror for the rest of the 90's) but Fred Krueger is infamous, unforgettable, unbeatable.",Null,0,0,11 October 2001
Cube," 'I'm not dying in a f**king rat maze!'
","~Spoiler~I gave Cube another go around the other day and realized that it truly is one of my favorite films.  It's the best sci-fi flick I've seen in a long while.  Cube is one of those rare films that has an oddness that appeals to all viewers.  The story relies on character development and dialogue because the movie does not stray from the cube. The characters are trapped inside and each have a purpose for being there. Watching the strangers go from optimistic to insane is downright scary.  The relatively unknown cast is amazing.  The best performances come from Maurice Dean Wint as the crazed Quentin who does one of the best flip-flops I've ever seen and David Hewlett.  For his work in Pin and Scanners II, Hewlett has become one of my favorite lesser known genre actors.  His character, Worth, is aptly named because he seems to have none.  He plays the most apathetic character ever, and he plays it perfectly.  The claustrophobic elements really work here as well and the cube design is awesome.  The booby traps are mind-blowing, especially the one Resident Evil 'borrowed.'  This all makes for a completely original yarn that is extremely entertaining.  Cube is definitely deserving of all its hype and an impressive debut for director Vincenzo Natali. Note for genre buffs:  Nearly everyone in the cast guest starred in the vampire/cop series Forever Knight.  Also, the characters are all named after prisons.",10,1,3,15 November 2002
Donnie Darko," 'Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?'
","I don't know what Donnie Darko can be classified as, but I say horror qualifies.  It has the power to make you feel uncomfortable in your own surroundings.  The unsettling loop of events you bear witness to are both haunting and intriguing.  I lost a night of sleep after watching it; trying to piece it together and figure it out.  It's definitely a fun movie in that it doesn't force-feed you the answers and I love Richard Kelly for that.  I think (pause) I loved it.  Yes, it's definitely a top five favorite.  Even if you watch this twenty times you will still miss some of the themes. Donnie Darko is a profound and affecting film unlike any other.  You should go out of your way to see it.'28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 12 seconds.  That is when the world will end.'",10,3,6,24 November 2003
Evil Dead II," 'Come to sweet Henrietta!'
","Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn is the sequel to the ultimate experience in grueling terror. Evil Dead II is the definitive cult flick and perhaps my favorite horror film (top five at least). Bruce Campbell takes on the role of Ash once again in this hilariously horrific sequel to a legendary movie. Few sequels live up to the original and fewer still surpass it. This is one of those rare instances. This movie is out of this world. Sam Raimi is a genius with a camera and has gone on to create some damn fine films. He deserves every amount of success he has gained. The script is inventive, highly original, and funny as all hell. It's a mix of horror, laughs, and gore; or splatstick as Campbell calls it. Once again, Campbell's facial expressions alone are worth the price of admission. If that doesn't get you the laughing deer head will. Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn is a true horror masterpiece. A completely original concept, some screwy camera angles, and one Bruce Campbell make for an entertaining combination. If you don't like it, 'I'll swallow your soul, I'll swallow your soul.'",10,93,127,21 September 2001
