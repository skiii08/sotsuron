The Avengers," Absolutely Wonderful, They Nailed It!!!
","This movie was hands down perfect! We go to movies like the Dark Knight to enjoy dark anti-heroism and deep meaning; then when we're in the mood for some good old-fashioned kick butt action and heroism, we go see Marvel movies. I for one love super heroes, sci-fi, fantasy, you name it; I'm a film buff who loves the fantastic, and there's no denying that this movie was fantastic! The direction of the action scenes was nothing short of genius; they flowed perfectly from hero to hero without even changing the camera. The acting was perfect, granted some were better than others, but there was really no weak link, they all had their big moments in the film, and they all shined when the time came. This summer is a great summer for superheroes and I for one am extremely excited. First, it was kicked off by the sensational Avengers. Second, we have the new take on the Amazing Spider-Man. And third, we get the finale to my favorite superhero series of all time with the Dark Knight Rises. I simply can't stress it enough, GO SEE THE AVENGERS!!! Sit back relax, enjoy being part of the crowd, enjoy the film, and when your done...go see it again (I know I will).",10,1,4,4 May 2012
The Hunger Games," Very Good, With Some Minor Issues
","The Hunger Games, did a splendid job, especially considering all of the hype it had leading up to its release. For me the Hunger Games is kind of like Harry Potter, except a little bit past my time, and not as good. As much as I enjoyed this movie, there were quite a few things that bothered me, as well as a number of great moments. Let's start with the negatives: 1) Too many awkward close ups 2) Not enough complexity, or showing of how the characters really feel, like it was in the novel 3) Pg-13, the novel was R-rated, I'm not saying that violence makes a movie, but in the case of the Hunger Games it actually does. Now for the positives: 1) Great Acting 2) Tense, well directed action scenes 3) Brilliant use of CGI 4) Very good at putting a face to the characters we read about. In the end, this movie without a doubt deserves an 8/10, and that isn't anything to sneeze at. I definitely recommend this to anyone who is even remotely interested, or whoever read the novel.",7,3,9,24 April 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Don't Let Some of the Critics Deter You, This Is Fantasy at Its Finest
","I found myself reading a number of mixed reviews from a vast array of critics this morning, trying to make some sense of what they were saying. I ultimately came to the conclusion that their complaints were tinged with bias. Granted most of them weren't necessarily bad, but mixed. I will admit that the film does start out somewhat slow, but looking back after experiencing the entire movie, I wouldn't have it any other way. The beginning of the film makes you care about the group as a whole, but more importantly, it makes you care deeply about the key characters: Bilbo, Gandalf, and Thorin. This is not the LOTR, it is an entirely different animal. The Hobbit is more of an adventure than an epic like the LOTR. Once the adventure began, I found myself becoming engulfed in what was coming next, and what new story we would stumble upon. I have read the Hobbit, however I have not read the Silmarillion. Throughout various parts of the film, Jackson incorporates stories from the Silmarillion to expand the universe even more. These took me a little while to get used to, but once again I soon realized how much they added to the story, and how much more they made me care about Thorin, Gandalf, and the entire Dwarven cause. The 48 FPS was absolutely spectacular, it takes movie escapism to a whole new level. I felt as if I was a part of each and every scene, soaking in the beauty of the landscape. Not only was this movie well acted, and well produced, but it was extremely well written. The film delves into ideas, and goes deeper as the film progresses. What really happens in the fight between good and evil, and what truly makes a hero? These questions are asked in this film, and that is the most important part. If a movie simply looks good, and has no substance, it would be a mediocre action flick with no legacy. But, when a film both looks great, sounds great, and FEELS great, then it is art. The Hobbit is art, and I am positive that it will only get better, the Hobbit has not yet been fully realized, but it is on its way, and while it may have its flaws, it has a heart, a brain, and tons of ambition.",9,7,15,15 December 2012
The Woman in Black," deserving an 8/10, well worth your time and money
","OK, I'll admit, I went into this film with not very high expectations, I left on the other hand pleasantly surprised and genuinely creeped out. Daniel Radcliffe, while not the best actor, also exceeded my expectations. The movie theater was packed and people really seemed to be enjoying themselves. People screamed when they were meant to and shivered accordingly. At the end the theater broke out in applause, and it was the most packed theater I've seen since the midnight premiere of Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 2. Walking out into the lobby people were still blown away, and I myself could not believe what just happened. So what I'm saying is, if you're looking for a fun night to be creeped out in an old fashioned horror film sort of way, go see the Woman In Black, you will not be disappointed.",8,105,174,4 February 2012
Looper," This Film Will Make You Think and Feel In a Way You Will Never See Coming
","Looper,wow! I'm writing this less than an hour after seeing the film, and the emotions rushing throughout my mind are nothing short of intriguing. This movie will make you want to instantly see it again. To be completely honest, I have to see this movie again, for a number of reasons. The first reason, is that this movie is daring, and I love that about it; it experiments with obscure camera angles and a number of changes in the plot, as well as the progression of the story. Kim Newman, from 'Empire' described this movie absolutely perfectly. She said, 'Looper isn't perfect, but it pulls off the full Wizard Of Oz: it has a brain, courage and a heart.' The first part is key, 'Looper isn't perfect.' Nothing is perfect and no movie is, they come close, and sometimes too close to call, but still, nothing is perfect. Thats the beauty of film, and the genius of this film. It knows that it cannot be perfect, so it decides to experiment, and push the audiences buttons. For the first few minutes, one cannot help but marvel at the beauty, as well as the scope of it. Each scene is shot perfectly, and in theaters gives the viewer quite the rush. You may think you know what your getting into, but you have no idea, and I refuse to spoil it, it would be unfair to the reader to be robbed of such an experience. Not only is the cinematography spectacular, the acting is some of the best I've seen. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is nothing short of amazing, and the rest of the cast does a pretty damn good job, if I do say so myself. For me, the best part about this film was the emotion. There were scenes that made me shiver, at how horrifying they were, and at how much feeling the actor was radiating. In short, if you haven't scene this film, go see it, I refuse to take no for an answer. If you have, go see it again, I definitely will be.",10,2,24,29 September 2012
