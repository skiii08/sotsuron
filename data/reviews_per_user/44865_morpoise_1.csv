The Blair Witch Project," A warning to those who get car sick!
","The person taking the tickets at the theatre door wished us 'Good Luck' as we walked into the movie.  I asked him what he meant, and he warned us that BWP was incredibly scary, and that someone in the previous showing had thrown up because of the movie.  I assumed it was because the movie was gory.  Not at all.  Anyone who remotely gets car sick will NOT be able to sit through this movie because the hand-held camera technique is worse than any car ride you have ever been on.  More than a handful of people left the theatre because they were nauseated by the camera motion.If your stomach can handle the constant camera movement, you will definitely enjoy the ride.",Null,1,1,30 July 1999
