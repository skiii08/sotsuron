The Incredible Hulk," Just the usual smashing done rather balanced...
","Is it good? Is it bad? Huh? Huh?THE GOOD: They've managed not pump it up with the usual toxic drama and cheap bashing - it has a fine dosage which will save you all the 'Oh come on!' and the usual exclamations of boredom from the people in the audience. Also Edward Norton seems a better choice than the last guy tough many people hate a to see a sequel with a new cast. So at least you won't regret watching it unless you are an edgy critic. And its better to see it than gamble for another movie of the season.THE BAD: Its not much content to start with, but thats probably because the comic doesn't really offer much movie material to work with. To make comic live on screen you need some seriously profound storytelling abilities, and I'm afraid the The Incredible Hulk (2008) isn't a break from the usual weak comic movies. Liv Tyler seems like a bad choice, it may be just me but i think that she uses the same look on her face in one too many movies and it ain't all that convincing any more. There were no little sugar cubes in the form of elements bringing grace to scenes. The plot aside, there's always infinite possibility for turning a plain old story into a remarkable experience but it seems nobody tries now days.BOTTOM LINE: If you want to see something with sensibly less of the usual cheap drama, profanity and lethally boring dialog you might wanna try the Hulk, with a bit of luck you might be fan of the green bag of muscles and enjoy your self without looking for special experience. But if you put that on the scales against going out with your friends on some other activity the movie should take a rain check.",6,2,5,7 September 2008
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," This movie is SO SO .... SO SO SO ... LAME ...! ( read it its not flaming )
","... The lights go out ... Andrew Adamson (director) is also there ... And the picture starts ...Night, dark sky. Nazis all around ... Nazis start London bombing ... A hose.

Behind the corner a carriage comes up.The audience: - Gandalf?NOP, its just me the strict butler (not to forget we are in england)Half and hour screen time goes by, and a kid finds its self in front of a wardrobe, she is so excited to find it that she nearly grows wings! So the kid finds a wardrobe filled with fur coats ( probably of killed Narnia beasts, probably symbols) the kid goes Through the wardrobe and finds it self in the the snowed up forest of Narnia. Forest. And in the middle of the picture, a gas lamp. SYMBOL.The audience: ( gets the idea) - This must be some kind of a symbol.After a few boring minutes the conflict in the family is all 'good to go' for the movie...Then we meet Tilda Swinton ( with her shocking beauty she played an angel as well as a witch) Andrew - director bursts : -THE WHITE WITCH!!! NOT THE SNOW QUEEN!!! THE WHITE WITCH!!! STOP IT!!

So they have Jisus in Narnia? So they have the Roman empire, which means the got the Jews too, so are we waiting for the Nazis to start bombing Narnia!?? What about everything else! What is going on here!? How does Narnia know about Adam and Eve? Do the creatures there read the bible? Or this is another SYMBOL ?

Yet the gestapo wolves don't give up, and the escape goes along with the arguing - 'Whos the leader', 'where are we running to', 'whos fault is it'. Its the fox's turn to help.The hardcore fantasy fans : Whats with the zoo? When do the ORCS show up?!Andrew (director): You probably dint get it, there are no ORCS!The hardcore fantasy fans : Xa!, even kids know that there is no fantasy with no ORCS LOL.Andrew (director): Ah, well there is fantasy... and fantasy ...The gestapo wolves find the tracks of the two girls and bigger brother a.k.a future king, since they were again reported by stupid brother a.k.a THE TRAITOR!STUPID BROTHER a.k.a THE TRAITOR : -I've done so much don't i get a Snikers or something, apple pie better!Gestapo wolves, beavers, fox and kids all run around, hide, jump, swim and WALLA they find Santa! Then he starts with the gifts;<ul><li>For you little girl a dagger!, to cut enemy throats in the night.. - For you bigger girl, a bow and some arrows, nail em between the eyes! - And for you DUDE it The sword to cut the skulls open of whatever stands in your way... - And for the other guy ? Aaah he is a lowlife nothing for him. - Merry Xmas kids, wish you many killing sprees ...</li></ul>The audience: -Santa is preparing kids for a massacre? -Oooh, we probably missed something between word or frames. -There gotta be some UBER DEEP THOUGHT and SYMBOLS YEAH MHM!

A short private talk with the lion, stupid brother a.k.a the traitor is been forgiven everything and the love between the kids starts on.",1,8,20,31 January 2006
In Time," Another succession of the modern production trend.
","You can't help but marvel, at how the industry sinks tens of millions into a Swiss cheese of plot holes. Not only that but they turn it to profit.As for the content, if you are looking for meaning you can find some, but it will be mostly your own doing. The few points it makes are buried under absurd.The acting fits what little there is of the script to go around.If you like to watch over an hour of plot which is full of annoyances a third grader wouldn't include in a film - then its for you.There is no typical consolation prize by intense car chases, sex or explosions to even try and substitute for the lack of everything (as they usually do).And if you are a Timberlake fan, there are cheaper ways to look at him. Suffice to say it doesn't get any better than what you see in the trailer.I bet it would have worked a lot better if all the speech was cut out of the film.",2,18,39,16 November 2011
Dark Shadows," (review outside of 'I love it' or 'I hate it') Well done film.
","Lets cut to the chase.You want to know...Heres things to know: The pace is steady and calm. The story is after all a recreation and it stays mostly dedicated.The roles are well done.The only actor that doesn't fit in is Eva Green, she does good, but she is just not for it, its almost like watching Ray Liotta play a nanny - has the depth to pull it of, but that wont help you feel its a seamless blend.If you have come to demand spectacular party favors out of films. This is not it. Its a balanced film, and the people who made have obviously taken their time to do it well, instead of go fishing for audiences' AWE or coppers.The end effect for me is 'A fine film, I am pleased to have seen it'. True its not a 'WOW, it blew me out of my mind, wow wow wow' - but not like regular stuff comes anywhere near it.If you have to pick between this film and some other film which is badly trying to impress you - pick this film. You can watch it, relax and enjoy it. That or you can get a typical film and hope to god that there is anything interesting in it other than whats on the trailer.",7,1,3,9 June 2012
