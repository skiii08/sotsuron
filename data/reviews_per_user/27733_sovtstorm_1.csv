Hereditary," Great horror until feminist ending
","This could of been a great horror. It was slow but actually held your interest. The acting could not have been better. The whole cast really outdone themselves. It was odd a white family had a son that looked middleastern but so what. I was enthralled, I lost myself but the ending was feminist witch porn. My girlfriend felt dirty after watching this. Oh the political message these days. If your into that stuff you are going to love this. If not saty far far away!",1,2,10,22 August 2018
