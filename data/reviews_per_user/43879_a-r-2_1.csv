United 93," Speechless
","It's hard to say anything other than this is probably as close as anyone can get to 'documenting', albeit in a dramatic way, the events of 9/11. I relived all the same dreadful, sad, mournful, angry, etc. feelings just as I did that morning watching it all unfold on TV.I'm not sure why, but it seems there has been an ongoing campaign to make us forget that day. Personally, I've chosen to remember it, as often and as faithfully as I can--even before seeing this film. Actually, I was truly concerned that this film would turn out to be part of the aforementioned campaign. It is not.If you were alive and aware of the world on 9.11.2001, I urge you to see this film.",10,4,8,30 April 2006
