Hereditary," Complete crap
","Huge Toni Collette admirer. She's the executive producer along with Gabriel Byrne. They are just making money. They had to know the script was crap in the end but that Toni's brilliant acting chops would confuse people long enough into the film to not walk out. By the end when she is flying around and cutting off her own head without any indication as to why or what lead to that, you are just left staring open mouthed at the stupidness of the stupid. Anyone who thinks this movie is actually scary instead of boring and faux arty aight to be ashamed of themselves as they cash the check for writing a positive review. I was duped by Toni and the 8 rating on IMDB. Complete crap.",1,16,37,12 June 2018
