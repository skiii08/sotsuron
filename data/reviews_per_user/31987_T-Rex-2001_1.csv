Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat ... funny
","I saw this movie on DVD. All I can say is that it was very funny. Sacha Baron Cohen deserves some sort of acting award, because many of the scenes were done live, no rehearsal, no script, and Cohen stays perfectly in character throughout. His sense of comedy and timing is very good. I won't divulge many details because that might lessen the fun.Yes, it is a little mean-spirited at times. The insulting of a pastor's wife is discomfiting. But most of the time what we are watching is Borat the boob and the hilariously incorrect things that he does. It reminded me of 'National Lampoon's Vacation,' with Chevy Chase. Borat is the same kind of clown, who always manages to say the wrong thing at the wrong time to the wrong people. There are a lot of decent laughs in the movie and a few for which Borat should be spanked.I would recommend buying the DVD if you've got some money to spare.",7,28,46,26 February 2007
