Alien 3," Terrible film invalidates the preceding one
","There should be a rule of sequels that one does not invalidate the entire purpose of the one preceding it.Aliens 3 cynically opens with, 'Hey everything you saw in Aliens 2, everything Ripley endured and did meant NOTHING.'Once you strip away that gleam of hope, instill a complete sense of futility, you create in the viewer a, 'What's the purpose, they are all gonna die anyway' mindset. Sequels these days while complained about do carry with them advantage over say the trilogies of even a decade ago.  Today most films with even a promise of a sequel or a series of sequels carry along with them a story arc.  There is a lot less of the making it up as we go along to the writing of each installment than in the past.  Even this is a double edge sword.  Where as you don't have to explain how a person who in the first movement was seen having their head chopped off didn't really die, you loose the creativity of having to write yourself out of what was once a story's deadend.",Null,556,660,22 May 2004
We Were Soldiers," Pity those that will never understand the courage of such men
","This movie has a soul. It shows respect for the American Soldier.  It isn't politically correct among many, including some of the posters here to do that it seems.Pity those who can't grasp the concept of men who believe there are things bigger than themselves and who bet their very lives on that belief.  The film accomplishes this tribute to the soldier by also giving due to the NVA Regular who fought with bravery. Nothing shows the nobility of a fighting man than by showing the quality and courage of his opponent. Like Colonel Moore says in his prayer however, he understands their humanity to a degree but wants them to die in battle and not his men.  That's compassion laced with a real world understanding of how things are.Men who throw themselves on grenades, who charge into enemy fire, who while wounded themselves risk themselves again to save a comrade are not Hollywood cliches.  There are countless citations of such acts made from Breed's Hill to the Sunni Triangle.  With the Sunni Triangle, it's happening as I type these words.  Kinear did a fine job showing the humor that is so common among men in the military.  Sheppard caught the spirit of the professional Sgt. Major, Barry Pepper displays well a time when an American journalist saw that he was first an American and then a reporter.This movie captures the worth and nobility of the typical American soldier. 
By the way, the only reason we have a film industry that produce films from all perspectives is because the American soldier made it possible. And this holds true for every nation in the world where films are made that are not censored by their government.  Because if it wasn't for the United States and her soldiers, freedom wouldn't exist anywhere.Remember that when you eat your popcorn.",9,2,5,22 January 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Does for violence what South Park did for profanity
","The problem with satire, is often the more well done it's made, there will be more people who won't get it.Everything here is over the top, but that's the point.  Quentin knows what he is doing in this wonderful mixture of styles.Just like South Park, Big and Uncut attacked the concepts and social structure of profanity (while not glorifying it by the way), Kill Bill does the same to notions about violence in movies.Having anime in the film isn't just a device to tell background or because Quentin is a fan.  It admits that the rest of the film can be seen in the same context.  The blood sprays from a newly headless body would require a hundred times more blood than the average person has, the ability to take on and defeat a hundred villains is something only a superhero could accomplish.The film calls upon a viewer to think about how they view different genres of film, what is true violence on film and what is of a cartoon nature and how far and just how dark a hero, can be allowed to go.",Null,0,2,16 April 2004
X2: X-Men United," The mean old military
","I would have liked this movie more if Wolverine wasn't shown killing a bunch of US Special Forces Soldiers sent into the school.  Yeah, let's have those mean old soldiers try and go in and hurt those poor little kids.The Hollywood cliche of showing every US General as either a fool or a villain continues.  Of course it follows the comic on this, but comic book producers are as left wing these days as the folks in Tinsel Town.
The fact that it doesn't even raise an eyebrow with people is proof of just how well the public has been conditioned to think poorly in some ways of what its government does.  When was the last time the CIA was show in a positive light?  It hardly ever is.  Well I got news for you, they put stars up in the lobby for CIA officers who die in the line of duty.  The crew that puts those stars up stays pretty busy.  Those are men and women who have died and continue to die defending this country.  Some can never, even after death, have their names revealed.As to the soldiers, the 'snake eater types' that Wolverine kills, there is something else to be remembered.  There are real heroes in this world and they are United States soldiers.  They along with their allies (Brits and others) are the ones that keep us safe from evils far worse and real than you are going to find in a comic book or movie.",Null,0,1,22 January 2004
The Thin Red Line," Serious head wounds only possible excuse for such dialogue
","The dialogue here between these soldiers sounds more like the Peyote inspired conversation of some freshmen philosophy majors. 
It's just so overwrought and tries to hammer its points of war is bad, the beauty within, and every other obvious pop psychology theme of the last half century.Caviezel is excellent and gives his usual and unique from another world performance as does Penn.  Nolte however must have been taking the drug he was linked with during a DUI arrest for longer than we knew.  His performance is simply terrible.  Granted his roll was written by people who obviously see the military as a collection of every cliche and neurotic type possible.  Your typical Hollywood writer knows few people outside those in his various therapy session groups.  Who in Hollywood is sane?The people in this production have read way too much Mailer and have seen Apocalypse Now too often. Perhaps doing so under the influence of the above mentioned Peyote.",1,4,8,3 June 2004
