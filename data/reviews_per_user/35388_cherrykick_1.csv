The Blair Witch Project," Technique:10 Actual movie:1
","The technique of this film was a brilliant idea. The finished product is nowhere near brilliant. The actors have watched too many Tarantino films and think good dialogue means a lot of swearing, especially the F-word. How do we show we're scared? We say 'oh F*** I'm so F***ing scared'. When I first heard about this movie and got to thinking about 3 students lost in the woods, not knowing what was going on, it gave me the creeps, I could imagine it. Walking home late one night through the woods I actually got pretty spooked. Then I saw the movie and thought, what a bunch of idiots. If I wanted to put my brain on hold then I could believe the kids were actually scared and lost and confused and possibly something evil in the woods was driving them loopy. Instead, thanks to very bad acting and unintelligent dialogue, I began thinking it might not be such a bad thing that they disappeared.People who saw the Sci Fi mockumentary were lucky in that it enhances the story line. I saw the 'documentary' first and went with my brother who hadn't seen it. He was completely confused during the movie, until I began giving him background information on the witch from the 'documentary'. He thought more of that should have been added to the film.Don't get the idea behind this film and the technique confused with the final product. The acting was terrible and drag the film down with it.",1,1,3,22 June 2000
