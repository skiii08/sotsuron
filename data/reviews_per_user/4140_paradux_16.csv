It," Obscurity Here We Come
","OMG. Well it is strange time in America politically socially geopolitically and psychologically. Even the weather is odd. So we expect movies to reflect that and nothing reflects that more than this god-awful gratuitous remake that somehow managed to lose all the good human bits of the TV movie and leave behind only the bitter husk.Aside from taking bullying to a new low, you have to believe that not even Stephen King (no longer a literary icon in the Youtube age) would prefer that this film have never been made at all rather than have it as part of his legacy.Recommendation: watch the original. Read The Stand. Watch The Stand. Go repaint the garage. Just avoid this.",4,12,22,12 September 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," The Force is Strong with this Review
","And it pretty much has to be, because this is not your typical review. I will however try to make it useful for present and future readers.1. This reviewer saw the original-original in theatres. I am not looking for bragging rights merely trying to establish some cred.2. The original was awesome. However at the time I saw it more as a self-contained story. Millions of others however saw it as a cross between a video game and a saga without end.3. In my view none of the following SW films came even close to the power of the original save for the Force Awakens and for that I credit those reviewers who deconstructed the 2015 film and found that the writing team had matched the action arcs to the original and in effect 'recreated' the impact of the original.The cliff hanger ending however was cheesy.4. This film is obviously designed to cater to the millions who, as above, see the franchise as endless and ongoing.5. As a film, the current film does not come alive until the last 45 minutes. That is a bit late. Props for turning tiny Felicity Jones into an action figure and props for taking Asia's top action star and casting him in what might be the biggest role in his career.6. Note the timestamp on this review. The last line of the film is about hope and today by coincidence Michelle Obama said that the 2016 US election had taken away hope from America. One wonders if, when this review is found in the IMDb database 100 years from now, America itself will actually be playing out the Star Wars saga in real time?",8,0,5,17 December 2016
Passengers," Date Rape Saga that Belongs in Guiness Book of Records
","Wow, talk about switching gears! The first 30 mins of this film is WONDERFUL. Considering the recent competition (Matt Damon, Sandra Bullock) the first 30 minutes of Passengers is right in there, a contender, fighting for the hearts and minds of the viewer.The accidental awakening, the obvious commerciality of the ship, the fact that Pratt's character cannot access anything more than coffee on the breakfast computer, the constant reassurances from the 'bots that 'all is well' (reminds you of what happens when you call your cable company) ... all the seemed the perfect setup for a really great LOST IN SPACE film.But. Alas, such was not to be. Instead the film takes a sharp right turn into rom-com town, and gives us perhaps the most elaborate date rape saga in the history of the human race.Pity.Closing comments: Pratt sells his character. Lawrence does not. There is no chemistry, even in the scenes where there is SUPPOSED to be chemistry.Would have liked to see the same film with Anna Farris (Pratt's real life wife) playing the female lead. Would have been more interesting.",7,2,4,4 February 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Annunaki (God) Syndrome
","Similar to the 1920s, as the real world gets crazier and crazier, people (especially young people) turn to fantasy for comfort.Similar to Sitchin's Annunaki story, those with power (Marvel and DC) soon see themselves as Gods and as such start to act with reckless abandon.Similar to what Zack Synder did to the DC library (Clark has no hesitation telling Lois his secret BUT LETS HIS DAD ACTUALLY DIE TO PROTECT THAT SAME SECRET) Marvel is playing God with their own library.The first hour is so dead it could fit into a zombie story. The second hour has maybe two or three interesting moments, assuming you are OK with the idea that the father of the girl you are crushing on has sworn to kill everyone you love.Overall, Marvel's TV division (SHIELD, LEGION) does better work.Raimi's SPIDEY2 remains the king.The simple fact that even the MSM critics missed this is disheartening.",5,6,9,22 July 2017
Suicide Squad," Best Harley Quinn ever!
","With your kind permission, will break the review down as follows: 1. The Story.Ugh! Near as I can tell, this has something to do with a government hack anticipating the need for a Dirty Dozen squad to replace Superman in an emergency and then the emergency turns out to be one of her very own making? Joss Whedon is not losing sleep over this writing team.2. The Motivation.Money, of course. The trend in Superhero films is backwards and bizarro, so this is an excuse to dust out the characters in the DC library who never get screen time and get the coins rolling. Same thing Marvel does.3. The Payoff.The film (saw the extended cut) is not bad. The lead reviewer who said it was worse than Superman Vs. Batman may possibly have misplaced his sense of humor. But the real payoff is the best live Quinn (played by Margot Robb) ever! Quinn has always been the perfect male fantasy that everyone else missed -- drop dead gorgeous, nutty as a fruitcake, and with a core of sweetness. Worth watching just for that.",7,0,1,3 April 2017
Doctor Strange," Great climax, promising beginning and plain oatmeal in the middle
","A massive amount of effort and money went into rebuilding this dusty old property from the Marvel library.You merely have to look at the John Mills film version -- or any of the forgettable animations -- to see the scope of the challenge.Part of the problem is that when Lee and Ditko first conceived Strange, neither had much of a clue about mystical stuff. So they came up the Eye, and Nightmare (probably the next movie) and the world's most forgettable villain Dormammu. Even the spelling of the name should tell you how quickly the original story was thrown together back in the day.However there are few problems on this planet that millions of dollars cannot fix. The casting of Cumberbatch was brilliant. OMG he looks exactly like the original character, right down to facial bone structure.However at the end of the day you have just another Marvel 'origin' story cleverly designed to permit either future individual stories or, as a last resort, to merge the doc into the Avengers. Wherever there is the most profit, I presume.The beginning is above average -- Tilda Swinton brilliant as always -- and the ending is BRILLIANT.In the middle you have a lot of sound and fury signifying mainly nothing. Astonishingly A-list stars Ejiofor and McAdams are completely wasted. Papier mache figures could have played these roles, they are so poorly written.",7,3,6,2 November 2016
Baby Driver," All those lines of dialog ending in 'baby' ...
","... give me flashbacks to DIRTY DANCING.1. You can't force 'clever.' Something is either clever or it is not. This film is ambitious but not clever. If you want clever, done right, watch Lucky Number Sleven.2. The romantic arc is weird, too convenient, not well developed and there is no chemistry.3. To borrow a line from Kevin Spacey's dialog, you want the good news? The good news is that the romantic arc is not an issue because this film a much bigger issue. No audience connection. By the 60 minute minute I did not care about Baby, or his instant girlfriend, or Spacey, of anyone. OK, I actually did care about the little kid who played the nephew. He should have starred.4. For those who care about dramatic structure, Fox's character is so top-heavy that he should be counter-point. But to who? Baby is so lightweight for most the movie that he cannot be counterpoint to Fox and Spacey at the same time.Over-rated to a scary degree. No wonder no two people can agree on anything anymore.",7,63,115,14 July 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," First Hour is truly magical ... Second Hour, Not So Much
","I believe it speaks to the enormous 'fun factor' in the first hour of Fantastic Beasts that the second hour -- which is typical of the what passes for slam-bang action in many of Hollywood's current A-list films -- tries to keep up, but ultimately falls flat.The internal dynamic of the film that fascinates.In the first hour we get something most of us thought we would never see -- Hogwarts in New York.Every moment of that opener is more fascinating than the moment that preceded it, and I can think of few films this can be said about.The cast is uniformly excellent. Standouts are, first, Eddie Redmayne. He may be young but if you have followed his work you know he is an actor's actor with a brilliant career ahead Another standout is Alison Sudol who personifies the good-natured gal from 1001 American movies from the 1940s.Then unfortunately we get the second hour and everything starts to come apart as suddenly Harry Potter yields to Avengers (civil war, internal conflicts) and even (in the fight scenes) to Dr. Strange battling Dormammu.If you stick it out, Beasts has what can best be considered a happy ending but nothing can change the fact that the 'happiness arc' for the viewer -- to coin a term -- starts at a high and heads downhill.",7,0,3,22 November 2016
Independence Day," Secret Space Program Revealed at 1:10 mark
","This review done in 2017 in the hopes of setting the record straight:1. First, I recently was subjected to the second installment which overall was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Bad writing, direction, story development and under-budgeted. Most obvious was the dearth of 'hi emotion' moments which are the high notes of a really good film, when the Adrenalin pumps and the endorphins flow.2. Which made me dig up a copy of this movie which I rewatched and thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish. Acting, writing, direction, hi notes -- all here. This film is a 9 or a 10. Anyone who thinks otherwise should turn in their crayons.3. Then as a bonus there at the 1:10 mark was the essence of the 'Secret Space Program' (a hot topic today) with Judd Hirsch explaining how it was funded... brilliant!",10,1,2,21 April 2017
Transformers," short retrospective review 10 years later
","When this little gem first came out, everyone thought it was a pretty cool little flick. But that's about all.With the benefit of 10 years of hindsight, and keeping in the mind that every successive installment has become progressively worse, we now see this as the pinnacle, the high point, of the franchise.Laboeuf and Fox actually had chemistry. In fact, Fox's career more or less imploded with Jennifer's Body, so in many ways this may be the only work she will leave to the historical record.(Also don't forget Fox's famous scene at the 25:00 mark where she opens the hood of Bumblebee to check out the engine. It has now become iconic. All around the world, millions of young people watching this scene instantly were able to resolve the issue of what their true sexual preference was, no further doubt remained.) It was even nominated for 3 Oscars. Seriously. Kid you not.",8,2,2,1 July 2017
Logan," Tuning into the year 2050...
","IMDb of course will still be here. In fact, in previous reviews I have suggested that by then the IMDb database which by then will be many times the size it is now, will be available for implant in newborns. At a tiny extra cost of course, That same year Amazon (still here of course) will offer a 'nostalgia collection' of superhero films from our current age. The price of the collection with include several sessions with a 'mood stabilization' counselor because vendors of the future will of course be aware that in the first two decades of the current current century, just before the Times of Turbulence, western audiences will in the throes of a depression so dark and so deep it did not even have a name. But the evidence of it was everywhere, in pop culture, in the news, in the political commentaries, and especially in the zombie and superhero films.Where every successive released tried to out-so its predecessor in terms of its own dismal view of mankind and the future of life on the planet.And this kind reader is the best review I can do of this movie at this time.The original X-Men in 2000 was a thing of beauty. It is the only movie I have ever ordered a VHS version of -- which implies that it is the only movie I have ever wasted money on, for obsolete media.Every successor to that film has become darker and darker.Must be an audience for all this because they keep cranking them out? All I know for sure is that, whoever that audience is, it does not include me.",7,5,12,13 March 2017
Snowden," Strange Movie for Strange Times
","The day I saw this film Stephen Hawking supposedly the smartest man in the world was quoted as saying that right now (2016) is the most dangerous time for our planet.Seeing this film I tend to agree. Taken alongside films like Spotlight and The Big Short (must sees!) we are living in a time where the biggest heroes, so-called, are turning out to be anything but; and the biggest villains so-called are turning out to be the heroes.Like Hawking said, this raises the issue of whether Mankind can survive such an existentialist crisis? As for the film, it was OK but not spectacular.Hollywood has a habit of casting for 'real people' based on facial features. In this case Gordon Levitt got the nod. He did a fine job with what he had but the script was weak and unfocused.And Woodley was miscast. Horribly miscast. Her career arc started with playing 'the girl next door' and over the years she has evolved into some sort of Amazonian princess. Not one scene between her and Levitt rang true.The blame for this lies with Stone who wrote, cast, and directed.Film is OK. Snowden is a hero.",7,0,3,4 December 2016
Beauty and the Beast," Disney simply cannot resist mucking about
","The first thing you need to understand is that, according to some scholars, every story is at its essence a love story. Even, for example, some the male-oriented actioners can be perceived as a tale where the hero is in love ... with himself.Second, the original Belle Et La Bete is an 18th century French tale with antecedents, they say, in older literature going back 4000 years. (Wikipedia) Since it is a French tale, it is only fitting that the French were the first to film it, in the 1940s, with Cocteau at the helm. One of my all time favorite films.Now to the Disney machine. Disney has done this story before. Disney, being Disney, simply cannot resist the temptation to set the story to music. Seriously. If there is a third world war, and 100 years from now, Disney does a film about that, it will no doubt be a musical too.The story was changed significantly. Add the musical interludes and you are really dealing with a variant or 'fork' of the tale but not the real one. It is significant that even the critics who love the film cannot help but notice that chunks of it are 'awkward.' Watson is a delight. Can never tire of seeing her light up the screen. The movie however is deeply flawed, and odd.See the French original. Or see the Kristin Kruek TV knockoff. Both are, overall, better and more focused productions.",7,1,11,19 March 2017
Prometheus," an enigma inside an enigma inside a gluten free bun
","One of the greatest film-makers of all times decides to revisit one of his greatest hits (Alien) with a prequel that arguably no one wanted or needed or even asked for.On the plus side, it is technically perfect, with a tight script, and SFX to die for. It raises profound questions on the nature of God as good as or better than the best theologians ever have. It has many twists and turns. Knowing that his earlier film had delivered one of the strongest female characters of all time (Ripley) he deliberately breaks his own record with a character who finds she is impregnated with a mutant killing alien baby and jury-rigs a surgery machine to remove it, barely escapes the machine alive as her own baby tries to eat her and without taking any maternity leave returns to her job and manages to rescue Earth.Not too shabby.On the negative side, trying to follow the story is a headache and trying to find a character to relate to is a headache and trying to understand the nature of God as presented here is also a headache.A hard film to review.",8,0,2,24 June 2017
John Wick: Chapter 2," Pimp my franchise...
","Reeves at 52 is the undisputed king of the modern 'man's thriller' and deservedly so.I recall before the release of Wick 2 catching an interview with Reeves where he assured his many fans that Wick 2 would be even better than Wick 1 because so much time and energy (and money) had gone into the script.And he was sincere.Just as sincere as the many mainstream critics who panned Wick 1 but astonishingly have fallen in love with Wick 2...???????? Because at the end of the day, our society is an upside down society and most everything today from geopolitics to finance to film works backwards.Wick 1 was a great film, the rarest of all things, an unexpected hit. It was a hit because it was pure and simple and the idea of man pining for his lost wife going to war over a car and a dog seemed ... right.Wick 2 is one of the most contrived and over-written scripts I have ever seen. And Reeves was being completely honest when he said that a great deal of effort had gone into this production. Because, once they had a surprise hit on their hands, the producers moved into 'franchise' mode and set about building an income stream, a brand, on the corpse of the first film -- which had nothing going for it except sincerity, good intentions, and outright class.A film reviewer is supposed to help viewers refine their own tastes and see beyond the obvious.I promise you that in years to come, more people will watch and cherish the first film than this loud and brassy pyrotechnic clone.",7,3,8,19 February 2017
Alien: Covenant," if this is the future of mankind, we are doomed
","Start with the good news.Scott is probably the best producer of space travel sets, backdrops, gadgets and paraphernalia. I cannot think of any other producer/director who comes close.The bad news? Scott appears to have forgotten everything he ever knew about story-telling and dramatic arcs. Worse, he seems to have ignored all the reviews of Prometheus -- all 10,000 of them -- and become even more determined to make these kinds of films. Whether anyone wants to see them or not.There is not one empathetic character in this story, not one. By the 45 minute mark you will find yourself wishing that the cast and even the production crew all die a horrible death.",5,6,12,3 July 2017
