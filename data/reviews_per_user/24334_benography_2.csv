Captain Phillips," An overlong middle hour ruins a potentially great film
","Captain Phillips - ** 1/2* Based upon a real event, Captain Phillips recreates the hijacking of an American Cargo ship by Somalian pirates in 2009. The film was slow and tedious in parts while being exciting and effective in others. Unfortunately for me the tedious far outweighed the exciting, and I found this film to be somewhat of a disappointment. The film sets it's premise excellently; the short scene between Phillips and his wife humanizes the Captain and gives Greengrass space to develop. We soon come to see Phillips as a hardworking, capable Captain with a very strict handle on his crew. The tension then begins to build as the plot begins to develop, and I was very much involved with the film at this stage. It is once the film gets right into the thick of its content that all the good work at the beginning is undone, and the tension begins to evaporate, causing the film to be incredibly tedious in some parts. Especially through the middle hour, I would have been quite content to fall asleep - it really was that slow.Despite some of the film's weaknesses, Greengrass does an excellent job of developing his two central characters, and the pirates are depicted brilliantly; neither villains nor heroes - just men doing their job. Billy Ray's screenplay also provides for some fantastic interaction between the two men, and some of the film's best viewing comes through in the intelligent, effective conversation between the two.Hanks does an unsurprisingly excellent job, and newcomer Barkhad Abdi's gritty portrayal of the head pirate is really quite astounding, more so considering that this is his Hollywood debut. If it were not for an overlong second half which completely eases the tension, Captain Phillips could have been a much better film. Despite this it is still decent - if not boring - seaside viewing.",6,5,12,28 October 2013
Rush," Superb F1 thrill ride with tight direction and strong performances
","Rush - *** 1/2* Ron Howard's Rush dissects the 1970's Formula One rivalry between the brash Brit James Hunt and his complete opposite in the cold and calculating Niki Lauda. The film moves at a perfect pace, providing us with insights into both characters while never painting either of them as a villain or hero in the audience's eyes. The film's major success comes through in the development of it's two core characters, and the contrast Howard places between them as competitors. The action sequences are incredibly tense and exciting, and yet they never take precedence over the film's central mission of developing the rivalry between these two great men. The driving sequences involve the audience to the point where we develop an understanding for the kind of utter danger these men put themselves in to live out their dreams, as Hunt says in the film of his car, 'It's really just a coffin on wheels.'Strong performances from Hemsworth and Bruhl also help drive this thrilling piece of cinema along. Hemsworth certainly impressed me with his brash and overt Hunt, but Daniel Bruhl stole the show for me; his performance conveys the completely mathematical and emotionless nature of Niki Lauda to near perfection. Strong supporting performances from Olivia Wilde and Alexandra Maria Lara as the men's respective lovers also add to the film's momentum.Overall Rush is a thrill ride from start to finish, never getting lost in itself and providing excellent character based action both on and off the track. In my opinion this is Ron Howard's best work to date (yes, including A Beautiful Mind!) and a film definitely worth catching in cinemas while you still can.",9,4,6,16 October 2013
