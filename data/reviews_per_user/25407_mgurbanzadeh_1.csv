Marie Antoinette," its about the feeling, not understanding
","I loved Marie Antoinette, and I can understand why this movie has so many haters. Marie Antoinette is a very feminine, light movie, that Im sure logical, looking-for-facts male population of the world would never enjoy watching. Firstly, the absence of the plot, makes the movie one room for feeling.It is the feeling of the place and the atmosphere which is a goal of the movie, not the actions themselves, that led to certain consequences. Commenting on one of the previous reviews I read, I can say, I don't think Marie Antoinette even needed this explanations, and portraying the Louie XV particularly right. It was not about him, the movie was about the age of reigning teenagers in chic and glamour of hidden rooms, It was about this age of beautiful dresses of the high society, overspent in lush. I love how Coppola shows this thru the visual beauty. We see a teenager, brought up to be married away, coming to a foreign country, prepared to be something, she doesn't really know what. So, she vanishes in the fun life of gambling, dresses, friends, gossip. And, she lives in this bubble of a world, where she doesn't really know what real France is, she doesn't really see what ordinary people live like. This underlines very well, how kings and queens of the time were distant from their people. About music: I loved the touches of the contemporary music to the XVIII- century France. We all understand it didn't look that way, and events weren't that simple and light.But the music, it just gives this feeling of taking the events out of the past and putting them on for now.Different accents, different styles of music, make up, and all that mixture in one big beautiful mess just makes this movie pleasantly bizarre. Its just as simple as that. Its not about the understanding,its about feeling it. I don't believe this movie could be better than it is. Enjoy",9,0,2,17 June 2011
