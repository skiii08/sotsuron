Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Dug every minute.
","Great movie.  A gorgeous babe of a queen, top-notch martial arts, racing action to beat anything NASCAR's ever shown me, and as a bonus I now know the origin of the emperor.Can I wait three years to find out more about the Sith?  If I have to. Would I like to see another Natalie Portman movie?  Yes.  Would I like to find out more about the origins of the Jedi?  You bet.I've read the criticisms of this movie.  Too much like a video game, too juvenile with the Jar Jar Binks stuff, too much droid fighting and not enough character development, etc.  Okay, so they have a point.  But this is still a four-star movie.  I'm seeing it again, and I don't normally do that.I didn't stand in line long.  About 30 minutes to buy the tickets last week, and another 30 minutes to get a halfway decent seat Wednesday night.  The hardcores weren't there.  They all saw it last night at 12:01 or this morning at 3:01.  I'm not a hardcore, and I don't think I'll ever consider any of the original trilogy among my 40 favorite movies ever.  But I loved this movie.  Lots.",6,0,1,20 May 1999
