Requiem for a Dream," Overall description
","Wow, where do I begin.  I went ahead and bought this movie on DVD, even though I hadn't seen it yet, after it came very highly recommended from several of my 'movie' friends.  I'm so glad I did because this is by far the greatest movie I've seen in an extremely long time, if not ever.  It draws you in with stunning visual aspects seldom seen in the played out mainstream movies and holds you with the simplistic yet haunting soundtrack.  The story itself is mesmerizing, showing how addiction (and addiction is the true theme of the movie, rather than drugs) destroys the lives of its victims. As it states on the back, the characters quest for and refusal to let go of their respective versions of happiness results in 'a nightmarish, gut-wrenching freefall.' To be able to say that this movie literally leaves you emotionally shaken is a testimony to its power, even in today's society, where there is little that were aren't desensitized to.  Award worthy performances by Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans.  Amazing movie. 11 out of 10.",Null,0,0,6 September 2001
