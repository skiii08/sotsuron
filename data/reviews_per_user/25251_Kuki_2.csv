Raiders of the Lost Ark," On of the best
","I can't remember when i first saw Raiders of the lost ark. I grew up watching the amazing Indiana Jones in his adventures. I know by heart every little line that all the three movies have. I wish Spielberg, one of my favourite producers, made a fourth version of Indiana adventures.",10,0,0,18 January 1999
The Silence of the Lambs," Suberb
",One of the most brillant film I've ever seen. Hannibal Lecter really can 'touch' us. In the night I've seen The Silence of the Lambs I couldn't sleep. Just suberb!,10,1,1,18 January 1999
