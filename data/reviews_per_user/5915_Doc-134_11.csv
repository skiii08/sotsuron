Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Is Lucas's Future-View Really That Positive?
","Before 'The Phantom Menace' was released, many critics released early reviews. I steered clear of them as much as I could so I would be able to go into the film with as much of an open mind as possible. I only began reading other reviews today. I have to say that I am on the side of many other critics who are critical of the film. I was not a big fan of the first three 'Star Wars' films, but I wanted to put all that aside and go into the film with the hope that something had changed. In the theater where I saw the film, there was a loud countdown before the projector was started and I felt as much adrenaline pumping as anyone, but after it was all over, I came out with mixed emotions about the film.The film had its good points; the special effects and sound were out of this world. The racing scene was amazing; the best part of the movie, I would say. Dare I say that all of the technical academy awards will go to this film at the next Oscars? It is a pretty good bet. But if there is any film guilty of having too many special effects, 'The Phantom Menace' is it. I suspect that one could watch this movie over ten times and still not have seen everything that George Lucas has painted onto his canvas. Does Lucas have a good imagination? Yes! But the problem is that his imagination seems to lie only in the visuals and sound, everything technical. If one was to take away the effects, there would be nothing left. This does not make for a good film. I had the same problem with last summer's 'Armageddon'. In movies of this sort, the stories are usually seriously lacking. While, I will grant that 'The Phantom Menace' is miles beyond 'Armageddon', the 'Star Wars' story really needed some more work. Lucas and his crew from Industrial Light & Sound were obviously so concerned with an audience 'awe' reaction with the effects, that they forgot to write a compelling story. What story there is, is often confusing and disjointed because the special effects are so overbearing and seemingly signify nothing. There are new creatures constantly popping out from every which direction, with no explanation. And half the time it is next to impossible to comprehend the relevance of the sets or landscapes where the lines of action are taking place. Sure, it all looks cool, but if one can not understand what it means, it is useless.If I could ask George Lucas one question, it would be 'Why did you bother having a cast of any actors at all'? The human aspect seems to play minimal weight in the picture, and one would think that Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Natalie Portman could be created digitally through the use of computers, just as all of the other creatures are. I wonder how much time was spent actually filming the actors as compared to the time spent in the studio concocting special effects. It seems to me that if Lucas could eliminate humans from his films altogether, he will have arrived at his masterpiece. It has been argued that Lucas's view of the future is much brighter than that of many other science fiction writers; that the future is not a place of darkness and damnation. The real tragedy here is that most of those other science fiction writers such as Philip K. Dick and William Gibson write in part about how technology causes a dehumanizing effect on people, so therefore it may be argued that they are providing a social commentary on exactly what Lucas is doing which is ridding his films of human content. And people buy into it, because he has the power and the money to create these technological film-making breakthroughs. I would not say that his future view of technology is bright and cheerful because the way he and many others use technology is exactly the concern of more critical science fiction writers. It is too dismissive to view the two realms of science fiction as only having differing views of the future. Each responds to and relies on the other.

L.A. Confidential," Justice Deconstructed
","What is the meaning of the word 'justice'? This is a question that Curtis Hanson's 'L.A. Confidential' compels its audience to ask numerous times. The film, which is based on James Ellroy's novel offers two vastly differing views on the meaning of justice, explicated in the varying styles of police work that the characters perform. Each man represents a different and opposing discourse within the police department. There is much 'dialogic' between each of the discourses. For example, the commander, Dudley says 'the department needs smart men (political men) like Exley and direct men like White'. The differences between these characters will be discussed later on. At first each discourse exists in its own realm, in terms of binary oppositions. But later on, the characters realize that they cannot do their jobs to the utmost of their ability when they are stuck solely in their own methodology of police work, and therefore the story begins to deconstruct the various binary oppositions.BUD WHITE (Russell Crowe) - White is an officer who is ready at any moment to break the rules, taking the law into his own hands to ensure that justice is served, however he is barely able to keep his raging violence under control. In fact, he adhere's to violence as a necessary adjunct to the job. He has no problem being called upon to do dirty work such as beating confessions out of criminals. White is man, whose driving force seems to be that of seeking revenge for his dead mother (killed by his father). One of the interesting things about him is that he never hesitates to beat a man who inflicts harm to a woman.ED EXLEY (Guy Pierce) - Exley is the golden boy of the police force, and will do almost anything to get ahead, except sell out by breaking the rules of conduct. He is a straight-laced, strictly by the book officer, who shows his desire to get ahead by his willingness to speak out against other officers when he feels that they do something wrong. 'Are you truly prepared to be despised within the department', Dudley asks. 'Yes sir, I am', Exley replies. Dudley also asks him if he would be able to beat a confession out of a man he knew to be guilty, plant evidence on a man he knew to be guilty or shoot a man in the back in order to be sure that some hot shot lawyer would not be able to get him off. Of course, Exley's reply to all of these questions is 'no'.JACK VINCENNES (Kevin Spacey) - Vincennes has a different agenda altogether, and it does not have much to do with justice at all, but nevertheless, his style marks a specific discourse within this particular police department, the LAPD. He wants the spotlight on television and the headlines in the newspaper. He is even the technical advisor for a T.V. show called 'Badge of Honor'. In one brilliant scene Vincennes goes to a house to make an arrest for narcotics abuse and he wants a movie premier in the background of the picture taken by the press.Each of these three men represent different ways (or discourses) of conducting police work. At first, all of these discourses are depicted as separate, but constantly conversing and conflicting with one another.In the course of the film, the Night Owl massacre takes place where a number of patrons are killed as well as White's partner, Stenzland. As the film progresses, the men begin to realize that nothing is black and white and they must work together to solve the crime. Exley suspects that White is up to wrong-doing and thus needs a way of keeping tabs on him. Vincennes agrees to help Exley as long as Exley will help him with another case. The men who were before always displaying conflict are now working with each other. White and Exley are now the true opposing forces within the department and the two come to a violent confrontation when White finds out that they have both been sleeping with the same woman. But despite their differences and perhaps their hate for one another, the men are put in the position of having to put aside their differences and unite their ways in order to solve the case, as Exley has found evidence that another man in the department (that I will not mention) may be the mastermind behind the massacre.At this point it is evident that no one police discourse is going to be enough to solve this crime; both men realize it and accept it. This is exhibited most convincingly in the climax of the film when Exley has the mastermind at gunpoint. The man asks Exley, 'Are you going to shoot me or arrest me'? We of course believe that Exley will make the arrest and further his reputation as the 'golden-boy'. We know this primarily from the earlier conversations between Dudley and Exley. But at the last possible moment, just before all of the backup arrives, Exley seemingly goes against himself and does something that neither he nor Dudley thought he was capable of doing. But the real question is; does he really go against himself? He may seemingly go against his own methodology, but does his view of justice really change or does he come to a higher realization of the essence of justice? I always find myself asking this question as the film ends.

Taxi Driver," The Taxi As A Metaphor For Loneliness and Alienation
","Few movies have the ability to be so vivid in terms of imagery that you can recall every single scene with the utmost of precision. Martin Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' is one such film. This film is such a powerful exploration into the tortured depths of a man's soul that I doubt if I could even forget one minute. In fact, this is one of Martin Scorsese's great strengths. Many years after 'Taxi Driver' he created his signature freeze frame shots to highlight important scenes and images, as a way to extend their importance. Scorsese does not use freeze framing in 'Taxi Driver', but it is hardly needed. He bombards us with many other image trickeries that reflect Travis Bickle's (Robert DeNiro) alienated and agonized psyche.'Taxi Driver' should not be viewed as a film about urban decay, even though it does take place on the filthy streets of New York City.  The film is more of a character study depicting one lonely man's struggle to live within the filth and corruption that surrounds him. Travis can not stand the place in which he resides, but he has no means by which to escape it. To an extent, Travis may even be drawn to the decaying world of the streets where he drives his cab because it is here where his anger and frustration is fed. Deep down, Travis is kind-hearted good person. He sees the urban decay around him and desperately wants to do something to change it. In one scene, Palantine (Leonard Harris), the man running for office, rides in the back of Travis' taxi. Travis tells Palantine that he would like to see someone in office who could clean up the streets of New York. 'I'd like to see it all flushed down the toilet', he states.The act of cleansing is an image that recurring throughout the film. We often see water from hydrants spraying the streets. Travis also cleanses the back of his cab after ever shift. In the narration, Travis says that he has to often clean blood and other bodily fluids from the back seat. What he has to clean from his cab represents the violence, pornography, and prostitution which is everywhere. Travis cleaning his cab is symbolic of his desire to clean up the streets.The taxi is integral in developing Travis's dissociated, and isolated self. The taxi is used as a metaphor for loneliness. Many people from all walks of life use taxis, coming from and going to their various destinations. The person who drives the taxi is an outsider, isolated from the many lives that he sees coming and going every day. In this respect, 'Taxi Driver' reminds me of T.S. Eliot's 'The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock', a poem about the anxieties of the modern world. In the poem, the speaker sees the city as a place where anonymous people come and go in transition to other places. The taxi in the film is similar in that it is a mechanism by which people anonymously travel from one place to the next. Travis is the outsider because he is stuck in this mechanism, just as Prufrock is stuck in the vast city landscape with 'restless nights in one-night cheap hotels'. But Travis is not only trapped in the confines of the taxi, but also the modern city, disillusionment, and disappointment standing in the foreground, just as Prufrock is.The taxi is often shown in fragmented parts. A detail insert will be shown of the mirror, then a cut to another detail insert of the back bumper, and so on. This fragmentation of the taxi is symbolic of Travis's alienated self. To break down the taxi illustrates that Travis's life is not whole. Something is missing. He has a need to make a connection with other people. He sees people everyday in the back of his cab, but they are people that he will likely never see again. He, just like anyone else has a need for love and acceptance, but sadly enough has little chance of getting it. Travis, one day sees Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), an attractive woman working in a campaign office. He asks her out and she reluctantly accepts. Travis is so much a part of the filth and scum that he detests,  he does not know better than to take her to a porn theater on their date. 'Everyone goes to these theaters', Travis tells her when she rejects him. Travis seems to be able to spot everyone else's dirt but his own. He is part of the world that he truly despises, and even when he tries to get out, he can not.As the story progresses, Travis's loneliness continues to grow. He desperately needs to reach out, but the city is full of women that he can not have. We can see that Travis is developing some kind of pathology as he lives out his pointless and routine life as a taxi driver. His confused state of mind is exemplified in the imagery that Scorsese presents on the screen; an example being a detail insert of a glass of water with bubbling seltzer. As well, the blurred city street lights are representative of Travis's life being distorted. About half way through the film, we have the famous image of Travis pointing the 44 magnum in the mirror, and the famous line 'Are you talking to me'? This is where I would say the turning point occurs. At this moment we know that his craziness, resulting from the streets, the loneliness and rejection that he suffers everyday is going to lead to a violent confrontation. The pointing of the gun in the mirror is brilliant. The image illustrates that anyone could be his victim even us, the audience, metaphorically speaking. But he is not only pointing the gun at us, he is pointing it at himself, as if he desires some sort of self-destruction. This is a great fore-shadowing scene. It would be unfair to give away who the confrontation is with and how it ensues. All I will say is that it revolves around his attempt to help a young child prostitute; Iris (Jodie Foster), get off the streets. This is another attempt for Travis to reach out.I am so tempted to give away some of the ending because there is one shot that I consider to be among the best in cinematic history. It is a slow overhead shot that occurs just before the film ends. Unfortunately, if I say what is shown in the overhead shot, I will have no choice but to give away what happens. But trust me, it is a moment worth waiting for, an I guarantee that you will never forget it. I must not forget to mention that a new edition of 'Taxi Driver' has been released, both in the wide screen and pan and scan format. I highly recommend the wide screen version. Anyway, it has some great documentary footage on the making of 'Taxi Driver', with interviews of Martin Scorsese, Paul Schrader (screenwriter), Robert DeNiro, Cybill Sheperd, Jodie Foster and a whole host of others.

Full Metal Jacket," The Best Anti-War Film in History!
","When I talk about 'Full metal Jacket', I guess I should clarify something. It perhaps isn't the best war movie ever made. Certainly, if you're looking for combat realism, Platoon is the sure bet. I think that it is the best movie about war (in general)ever made. I put it above other war movies because of its skill in delivering an anti-war message; it never presents any redeming qualities about war. In this film, war is just wrong, and there is nothing glorious or glamourous about it.Most war movies are anti-war in a sense, but a great many of them view war as necessary or unescapable, and those that go and fight in wars are glorified as heroes (patriots to their country). Heck, they fought for their country, right??? This is very apparent in films like 'Saving Private Ryan'. This is one of the major problems that I feel the film has. It sends a contradictory message. On the one hand, it illustrates in gruesome detail how horrible it is to be in battle, but yet at the same time there are a number of times where the American Flag is plastered across the entire screen. The movie redeems itself so that audience members come out of the theater feeling comfortable. If a movie is to be a truly anti-war film, then people should not leave the theater feeling happy. Don't get me wrong, I liked 'SPR' even though I am not am not a Spielberg fan, but I honestly think that it would have been more effective if it had been done as a documentary only showing the first half an hour. I have never been anywhere near a war, but in my opinion the opening sequence of 'SPR' looks pretty real. This sense of 'redemption' does not exist in 'Full Metal Jacket'; its as anti-war as anti-war movies get, and for that I respect it greatly.I also enjoyed the opening sequence of the soldiers being trained, by Sgt Hartman (Lee Ermey). This portrays the training process of marines as raw exploitation of human beings.  These men have almost every aspect of their humanity torn away from them. Essentially, they become machines, killing machines. Numerous times in the film it is stated that the marines want'killers'. When Private Joker (Mattew Modine) says that he wants to go into military journalism, Hartman's response is 'you're not a writer, you're a killer!'I have said that 'FMJ' is the best movie about war in general. Films like 'Platoon' or 'SPR' are specific to certain wars, being WWII or Vietnam. 'FMJ' is set in Vietnam, but Kubrick's ideas about war can be applied to war in general. That is where I feel that the true genius of this film lies. Kubrick's 'Paths of Glory' can also be seen in this respect.",10,0,0,16 March 1999
Apocalypse Now," The Rhetoric of 'Apocalypse Now'
","In the film 'Apocalypse Now', we follow Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) on his mission into Cambodia to assassinate a renegade Green Beret; Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has set himself up as a God among a local tribe. In a sense, Kurtz has set up his own army within the jungle that resembles that of a tribe. As Willard descends into the jungle he is slowly over taken by the jungle's mesmerizing powers and the battles and insanity which surround him. The further he takes his journey, the more he becomes like the man that he was sent to kill. Kurtz has succumbed to the power of the jungle around him. At one point Willard mentions that 'The jungle is where he really takes his orders from'. Willard can feel himself slipping into the same mode of human existence.There are echoes of Bahktinian discourse within  'Apocalypse Now' in that there are always two forms of rhetoric speaking and opposing one another. The first is the civilized western institution of the miliary. The second is a more primitive, instinctual world, where primal instincts prevail. These two voices seem to be always oppose one another, but when it comes down to the climax of the film, we see that the film has attempted to draw a relation between the two.The structured, civilized, and supposedly moral institution of the military has given Willard a Â‘simple' assignment to travel up river, find Kurtz and terminate his command 'with extreme prejudice'. These orders laid out in a highly structured manner, which is characteristic of military discourse. Willard soon realizes that the mission really isn't as simple as his commanders attest it to be. In one scene later on Willard says 'I thought I would know exactly what I was going to do when I saw Kurtz, but now I'm not sure'. His journey along the river gives him a certain insight into Kurtz's psyche.In practice, even the rest of the military that Willard encounters as his escorts up river seems to be undermined by carnivalization, meaning that there is more freedom from restraint than what the military would expectedly allow. We have Sgt, Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who seems more concerned with surfing than with the war they are fighting. He is constantly looking at the tides to determine the plausibility of a good surf, and having his men surf the beach whenever they invaded a village. There is even a scene where they bring in two Playboy bunnies to dance for the sex starved soldiers of Vietnam.  Men also water ski behind the patrol boat, and suntan on deck. This is not something that we would expect to have occurred in Vietnam.As Willard continues his journey, he still is aware of the mission that he has been sent to accomplish, but he sees more references to primitive and tribal ways, the closer he gets to Kurtz. In one scene, the jungle seems to come alive and attack the boat. Suddenly thousands of spears are hurled at the boat, from no apparent location except for the jungle itself. All we see are the arrows flying out from the brush, we never see anyone throwing them. And arrows in themselves are a symbol of tribal practice.When Willard meets Kurtz, it is then that the voices of ordered military and primitive, tribal instincts are truly revealed, but Kurtz does not see them as opposing, as such. He suggests that the two may be amalgamated, which is perhaps a sign of his psychoses. In a long monologue, he argues that the military needs men who are moral, but yet at the same time are able to utilize their primordal instincts to kill without feeling, without passion, without judgement. '...It's judgement that defeats us'. He says that 'if I had ten divisions of those men, our troubles here would be over very quickly'. This is where the two opposing discourses truly meet with one another. There are multiple ways that one can interpret 'Apocalypse Now'. The film has a huge multiplicity of meaning and what I have said is only one of many ways of viewing it.**** out of ****",10,0,0,5 April 1999
Saving Private Ryan," A War Movie That Adds Nothing to the War Genre
","One of the great things about seeing a film twice is that it allows you to go back and see the flaws that flew right on past you the first time you saw it. When I first viewed 'Saving Private Ryan', I enjoyed the film, but at the time I didn't really think about why. I walked out of the screening not really thinking about the film at all. First bad sign! Later on, at home, I began to think about the impact that 'Saving Private Ryan' had on me. I started to feel as though the film had no impact on me what so ever. Second bad sign! How could this be? How could a film acclaimed by so many as one of the best war films ever made, have no effect on me? So, in a couple of days, I went and watched it again and then everything became clear. 'Saving Private Ryan' is Steven Spielberg through and through. When I first saw the film, I had thought that Spielberg had risen above the many poor works of his past, but I was dead wrong.Steven Spielberg is a master at pulling the wool over the eyes over his momentous audience. He made many of us feel that we really needed another epic WWII film, such as what he has created. He has done the same thing with other films such as 'Schindler's List' and 'Amistad'. While I admire 'Schindler's List' for its historical merits and its importance of topic, I hardly regard it as the high form of cinematic art that so many have claimed it to be. My opinion of 'Saving Private Ryan' does not change too much from this.The film does nothing to add to the war genre. Much of it is a regeneration of older, and much better war films. Not only this, 'Saving Private Ryan' blatantly contradicts itself. The film is obviously meant to be perceived as an anti-war film. I suspect that Spielberg would not have filmed the opening battle scene in the manner he did, if it wasn't. No doubt, most people will see this as an anti-war film, but is it really? I think not. If a film is to be truly ant-war, then there can be no redeeming qualities of war. This means that war can not be seen as heroic or patriotic. How many times was there a flash of the American flag over the entirety to the screen? I can not remember, but if it was five, then it was five too many. There is an overwhelming question in the film. Was it really worth it to go to the trouble of saving Private Ryan (Matt Damon)? Of course, in light of the fact that the majority of the Hollywood audience is intolerant of ambiguity, they answer this question. John Miller (Tom Hanks) is to be seen as an American hero for the mission that he and his squad accomplished. This does not sound like anti-war to me. In great war films like 'Paths of Glory' and 'Full Metal Jacket', there are no heroes that transpire from battle at the end. There are no redeeming qualities illustrated at all. In these films, war is depicted as ugly, inhumane, alienating, and just plain wrong.The opening battle sequence which lasts for about 30 minutes is wonderful in its brutal realism and its leads us into thinking that we are about to experience a truly harrowing war picture. In fact, this is one of the best sequences that I have seen on film, and the movie is worth seeing just for the one scene. We, the audience really feel as if we are in the midst of this highly violent and bloody battle at Normandy.  The sound quality and the visuals are immaculate. The camera seems to take on a role of its own. It seems to be ducking behind objects to avoid being hit by bullets, just as the rest of the soldiers are. The entire scene is shot with the hand held camera, with jerky, and often disorienting movements, adding to the chaos of the battle.Unfortunately, the rest of 'Saving Private Ryan' isn't as well made as this first scene. The battle scene near the end of the film feels like something out of an action movie. It has the same effect as an action sequence from one of the 'Die Hard' movies in that it thrills us with its fast-paced shootouts and numerous explosions. I found myself not caring who was killed and who wasn't. It felt like cartoon violence. I enjoyed watching the sequence for this reason. It came no where close to having the same impact as the opening battle.While I recommend seeing 'Saving Private Ryan' for the technical merit of the opening battle, problems continuously present themselves throughout the rest of the film. It contradicts its anti-war presence. The ending is summed up to nicely. Leaving the end more ambiguous would have been effective at least in terms of provoking thought. My strongest objection to the film is its sinking to the level of an action picture at the climax. This is not something that I wanted in a film of this scale. 'Saving Private Ryan' leaps to a great start, but ends up not having the endurance to make it to the finish line as a winner. *** out of ****",4,1,4,16 April 1999
Pi," A Journey into Mathematical Madness
","1) Mathematics is the language of nature2) Everything around can be understood and represented through numbers3) If you graph the numbers of any system, patterns will emerge.These are the three fundamental assumptions that Maximilian Cohen, a genius mathematician has of our universe. He believes that patterns exist everywhere in nature; in disease epidemics and even the rise and fall of the Nile. Math is everywhere, even in the swirls that cream makes when you pour it in your coffee, or in the billows of smoke from a cigarette. Maximilian states that even Leonardo DaVinci penciled the 'golden rectangle' into his masterpieces which generated the mythical 'golden spiral'. Pythagoras saw this spiraling shape everywhere in nature including our finger prints and DNA strands. This, Maximilian thinks is the basis for all understanding. There is a recurring motif of circular composition to reinforce this. For example, there are many shots in which Maximilian looks out the peep-hole on the front door of his apartment. When he does this, we not only see what is outside the door, but we see what is outside the door through the circular border of the peep-hole. This spiraling effect is also created in camera movement. Most notably, in one scene Maximilian is standing on a crowded street, and the camera begins to circle around him quite rapidly (circle dolly, or crab dolly).'Pi' is a journey into the Maximilian's mind as he struggles furiously to find the meaning of our world in terms of mathematical patterns. Theoretically, if one can explain everything through patterns, then he or she can explain the essence of even 'God'. But the real question is whether we as human beings are really capable of understanding the true essence of life. We can see that Maximilian is going more and more mad, the closer that he 'thinks' he is getting to the truth. He knows that he is close to the truth, but that he just can't quite grasp ahold of it. It may be true that in theory everything can be explained in terms of mathematical patterns, but in reality, perhaps we just don't have the intellectual capacity to do so. If we attempt such as colossal feat, perhaps it will lead us to madness.The cinematography and editing of 'Pi' are impeccable. It is filmed in a grainy, black&white fashion, and is essentially chaotic. Much of the film is done with the hand-held camera, showing jerky movements.  'Chaos Theory' suggests that we can find mathematical patterns in even the most chaotic and seemingly unstructured elements of the world. The chaotic filming techniques greatly reflect Maximilian's search for truth. Our world is chaotic, and he is trying to make sense of it through any mathematical patterns that he can find. I found myself asking if there is any continuity or pattern to the editing and camera work. Director, Darren Aronofsky quite likely wants us to ask that question. There are certain patterns that can be followed, and many that can not, at least through human intellectualization. The mathematically precise beats of the electronic music soundtrack also set a beneficial mood to the film, reflecting to an even higher degree that patterns exist in everything, and that, as Maximilian states in his assumptions, 'Mathematics is the language of nature.'**** out of 4",10,2,5,30 March 1999
The Departed," Scorsese Proves That a Remake Should Never Automatically be Dismissed
","'I don't wanna be a product of my environment; I want my environment to be a product of me.'  Frank Costello Memorable quotes are abundant in Martin Scorsese's new thriller, 'The Departed', but none of them describe the theme of the film quite as elegantly as the one above. Frank Costello, portrayed with devilish glee by the great Jack Nicholson is a man who demands absolute control over everything around him and will stop at nothing to exude his will in obtaining it. What's interesting about this film is that this sort of machismo persona is evident in many of the male characters we meet, no matter which side of the law they reside. These guys are almost over the top to the point of being comical, but it helps to create characters that blur the line between the good/bad dichotomy. Take for instance the character of Dignam (Mark Wahlberg), a police officer who is every bit as nasty and belligerent as Costello - maybe worse. Ellerby (Alec Baldwin), is also an example of this. All of these guys think they can control themselves, each other and their environment, but of course nothing is further from the truth.'The Departed' stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy Costigan, a young cop who is sent undercover to infiltrate the Boston Irish mob led by Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Meanwhile, Collin Sullivan (Matt Damon) who has been nurtured from the point of childhood by Costello now works for the police department's Special Investigation Unit (the unit ultimately responsible for taking Costello down) allowing him to provide inside information. Tension builds at an expeditious rate when both the police and the mob realize that there is a traitor among them and that both Costigan and Sullivan are in danger of losing their cover. Parallels between cops and criminals are again drawn when both men are called on to test their loyalty to the other side under intense life or death situations. As Costello himself says 'When you're facing a loaded gun, what's the difference?' The character foils depicted in 'The Departed' remind me a lot of what Michael Mann has previously done in films such as 'Heat' and 'Collateral', but they also further Scorsese's own canon of work, building on the greatness of films such as 'Taxi Driver', 'Raging Bull', 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino'. Scorsese is very interested in the psyche of alienated loners on the edge and he also likes to explore the notion of 'betrayal'. These motifs are evident in much of his work. In 'The Departed' Costigan and Sullivan are both loners and are each guilty of at least one betrayal. Ultimately, the real question becomes; whom have they betrayed? This question is not easily answered.A review of 'The Departed' would not be complete without a discussion of the film's technical marvels. Thelma Schoonmaker, who has edited every Scorsese film since 'Raging Bull', creates a desperate energy, which reflects very well the emotional states of Costigan and Sullivan, while also keeping us eager to see what happens next. Schoonmaker has an ability to create cohesion out of chaos. In the hands of a lesser talent, this type of editing would overshadow characterization and plot drastically, but like all great film editors, she is able to reflect a film's themes, mood and emotional states through choice of style.Michael Ballhaus, who has been Scorsese's cinematographer several times in the past, also deserves much praise. He should especially be commended for bringing Boston to life like no one has ever done. I am fascinated by cities in film and when they are photographed so well that they become a character in themselves, it is truly a delight. 'The Departed' is all Boston, and while a few scenes were filmed in New York, you would never know.Despite the fact that 'The Departed' has by enlarge been hailed a masterpiece by the critical community, some have criticized Scorsese for being a 'sell-out' or 'going too mainstream'. Others just feel the film is completely unoriginal. It must be said that 'The Departed' is in fact a remake of a 2002 Hong Kong film called 'Infernal Affairs'. I have not seen this film and therefore cannot comment on its quality, but I will say that to automatically dismiss 'The Departed' because it's a remake is very unfair. Normally, I am skeptical of remakes myself, but it is quite obvious that Scorsese and his screenwriter William Monohan have crafted their own vision of this material and as a result, it easily stands on its own. Those who have seen other Scorsese pictures know what I mean.There are many reasons to like 'The Departed', as I've discussed, but I think the most important thing is that ultimately this film is just a purely enjoyable crime/gangster drama. In fact, I will go so far as to say that this is one of the four or five best gangster films of all time with the likes of 'Goodfellas', 'Scarface' and 'The Godfather'.",10,1,3,21 March 2007
The Waterboy," The Worst of 98
","Okay, now for me to give a movie on this database a rating of 1, I know it must be pretty bad. There is absolutely nothing that I liked about this wretched excuse of a movie. Film has sunk to an all time new low with this. Why even Adam Sandler would get involved with this picture, is beyond me. He has done some good work. I thought that Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore were hilarious. But The Waterboy was just so childish and infantile, it was unbearable. I was honestly surprised that I was able to make it through the entire film without walking out. I can honestly say that I didn't laugh once in the duration of The Waterboy. When I go out to a movie to see a comedy and laugh, this really irritates me.",1,3,7,16 March 1999
Blade Runner," A Question of Humanity?
","How do we know that we are human, and if we are human, what does it mean to be human? These two philosophical inquiries are explored at great length in Ridley Scott's 'Blade Runner' The film is based on Philip K. Dick's great novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' The inquiries that I have just mentioned were originally present in the novel, and despite much academic criticism, they are also present in 'Blade Runner'In a sense, it is difficult to discuss the film without discussing in terms of the novel, so I will make constant comparisons in this review. Many critics have argued that the awesome visual effects and stylish cinematography overwhelm the content of the story and themes. This response is not entirely uncommon, despite the huge cult following the 'Blade Runner' has accumulated. The film does not deserve such criticism. On a second viewing of the film, the spectacular effects do not overwhelm the story. We can understand that the visuals depicting Los Angeles in the year 2019 help to advance the themes. Many critics miss the human side of the story, or lack there of, and may object to the powerful visuals for this reason. It can be argued that the visuals serve to portray a dehumanized world where only subtle signs of humanity's existence are dispersed throughout, where existentialist notions such as what being human is and what being human means are not easily answered. In a way, each medium reinforces the other. There are many obvious differences between the novel and the film, but they essentially complement one another in result.'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' has two primary themes, which are also present in 'Blade Runner'. The first is what constitutes the essential human being and how we distinguish the essential human being from that which only masquerade as human. And the second theme is that if you fight evil, you will wind up becoming evil. In the film, we have the character of Deckard who is becoming more and more dehumanized throughout the story, and the replicants are becoming more and more human. At the end they meet and the distinction is gone.",10,0,1,19 March 1999
The Matrix," A Great Beginning that Doesn't Pay Off in The End
","Most of the other comments that I have seen on 'The Matrix' I see have focused on the technical aspects of the film. The technical aspects are prodigious, but I would like to spend some time discussing the philosophical issues behind the film. Philosophers have debated for years about 'reality'. One of the assumptions is that what is 혩real' is what we are conscious of. This seems to be the view that the film takes. In the film Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) tells Neo (Keanu Reeves) that if what is real is what we are conscious of, then it is true that the matrix does exist. The other view is that in the world there are certain realities that are indifferent to our perceptions. This argument, in my opinion, does not hold much water. We may want to think that there is a specific, fixed 'reality' because we as humans usually see things in a similar light. But, let's take the example of an animal such as a dog. Research has shown that dogs can only see in black and white. If this is true, then we can rightly assert that a dog's 'reality' is quite different from that of a human's. How are we to know which is the true 'reality'? We don't. A dog's reality is black and white and our reality is color. This however does not mean that what is 혩real' is either of these; both are equally real in terms of the systems of perceptions of each being (dog and human). Dogs and people have different modes of perception, thus creating different perceptions of 'reality'. One may argue that there is no 'real' in the material sense of the word, as there has to be a mechanism of perception enabled by a sentient being for any notion of the 'real' to exist. In other words the 'real' cannot exist without 'perception'. I know these ideas are quite complex and the example that I have used isn't directly related to 'The Matrix', but I think that this philosophical concept in general is explored, and thus what I have discussed is quite relevant.Philosophical abstractions such as what I have described are fascinating, and are integral to the making of great science fiction film. The greatest science fiction films not only amaze us with their use of technology, they also have a deep understanding and care for the human condition, which according to a Marxist view is incompatible with technology. Many films of this genre present technology as a form of ideology propagated by a ruling class (the bourgeois). Technology is seen as a dehumanizing agent, and much of the great work in science fiction is done as a social commentary in reaction to rapid technological expansion. This response is present throughout the works of writers such as Philip K. Dick and William Gibson, both of whom have obviously influenced Larry and Andy Wachowski's script for 'The Matrix'. I see hints of ideas from films such as 'Dark City', 'Blade Runner', and 'Strange Days' as well. This is not a negative thing though; the story of 'The Matrix' is fairly original despite all of its influences from previous work.There is a point where 'The Matrix' falls short, however, and that is in its action sequences. The action sequences look spectacular, but when it comes down to it, they seem like they are inserted as nothing more than fillers where we could have been acquainted with new ideas. 'Dark City' was a great science fiction film for many reasons, but one of them is the fact that it didn't overwhelm the audience with familiar shootouts (ie Die Hard films) and fight scenes (ie John Woo's Hong Kong action pictures). When the big action scene towards the finale of 'The Matrix' occurs, it feels like the Wachowski brothers left the set leaving the direction to John Woo. John Woo loves to see action in slow motion, and trust me, there is plenty of that here. It all looks good, but it feels out of place, as though the producers must have stepped in and said that their had to be a big action sequence to draw upon a wider audience.Overall, 'The Matrix' was a good movie, but not a great one. The first half or two thirds of the film are spell-binding with its issues of 혩reality', but it begins to fall apart towards the end, where action scenes take center stage and overwhelm the point of the story. In short, I wanted to see more emphasis on the philosophical roots of the story and less emphasis on adrenaline pumping action sequences. Good, original ideas can build up suspense and adrenaline too. 'Dark City' and 'Blade Runner' proved that to me.*** out of ****",7,0,0,5 April 1999
