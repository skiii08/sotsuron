Black Swan," Natalie looks great only as a White Swan
","In my opinion, this movie is a way overrated. We've a beautiful ballerina, Nina (Natalie's beauty is stunning) who wants to embody two different roles (Black Swan and the White one), but, as her coach opinion (Cassel), she could be only a white swan, because of her innocence and evident inexperience in life. Another ballerina, Lily (Kunis) wants the major role too, and she's perfect for it, for Black Swan part. The only way Nina could learn to be a different person is lose her control and give her anger off over Lily, in a strange union of perversion and itch to be convincing. The problem of this movie is not the idea of make a movie about classical dance or about the hard approach of a young dancer to one of the most difficult roles, but is in screenplay. I haven't been overwhelmed by this one, and the acting is not very good. Especially Portman, who, although her incredible beauty, is very very overrated as an actress. I don't understand why every American critic define her as a prodigious. She has only two facial expressions: happy and sad. She's insomuch concentrate to be convincing as a ballerina that she forget to act as a problematic girl. She's convincing when she's the perfect and pretty girl, but she couldn't do the opposite. I'm sorry, because I know she's a very clever girl. The rest of the cast is a little bit better; the only strong performance is Mila Kunis, a great revelation. Cassel is in part, but not at his best; Ryder can do much better, but here she has only a small role. It's the same for Barbara Hershey. Definitely, a good idea in a wrong movie.",2,9,25,6 January 2011
