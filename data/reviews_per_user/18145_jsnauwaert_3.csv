Marie Antoinette," What a tasteless, meaningless sequence of pics!
","Rarely saw such a pointless movie! Well, that is, if we can talk about a movie in this case. After seeing it, I became rather convinced that the order in which the images follow each other, could be put in any, arbitrary order to obtain almost the same effect (boring!!) as the original 'movie'. The character, as presented in the movie, of Marie-Antoinette, is utterly uninteresting. Hard to imagine why anyone would like to make a movie with as main focus this person. Arriving at Versailles, she very soon gets bored and equally soon gives away to costly forms of escapism: opera (the least costly, I suppose), expensive costumes, hairdressing, parties ... But, what is worse, we as an audience get even more bored than she does. Not one character is strong, pronounced or interesting. Of course, she gets criticism for her egocentric, egoistic behavior that costs a fortune, even considering the wealth of the royal family and entourage at that time at Versailles. And the common people, heating up for the French Revolution - that by the way, is not portrayed in any depth in this movie neither - and suffering more and more from hunger, of course also expresses its criticism on M-A. The thing more than half the time of this far too long movie is spent to however, is on the procreation of the royal dynasty, or rather, on the danger of non-procreation of it, since the consummation of the marriage isn't taking place. For this big problem, M-A is constantly receiving warnings and strongly recommended to put an end to this drama. Perhaps Sofia Coppola tried to make some sexual portrait of this epoque, I am not sure, but it is a fact (well, if we are to believe the movie with respect to this sexual related matter) that precisely concerning this point, M-A is the least to blame, the reason simply being an very inhibited and very clumsy husband (the future king Louis XVI). But, in all cases, the woman, - or in this case the future queen - seems to have been held responsible for the non consummation of the marriage. Well, in the end, the problem is solved, and M-A will give birth to two children, the second being a boy (the dauphin) who will of course be held responsible for the continuation of the glorious dynasty of the Louis, at least, if the French Revolution will not prevent that from happening, which it will. OK, lots more could be said on this movie, but I'll stop here. The pity is not only that this movie obviously painfully failed, but moreover that it failed with a very promising cast. I wouldn't say that Kirsten Dunst is a great actress, but with a total lack of any good or consistent script, she simply didn't get a fair chance. The other actors are even worse off: Sofia Coppola simply doesn't focus at all on anyone else than M-A, so an excellent actor like Jason Schwartzman doesn't even get a chance at all to save something from the total loss. A shame! I hope Sofia Coppola won't make another movie for a very long time now (or not at all), or if she does, that a good script writer will have been there to support her and hopefully a dozen of very good advisors of all kinds.",2,31,62,15 June 2006
Troy," Excellent movie
","It's undoubtedly true that Troy is a movie with in the first place a huge budget (I heard something like 180 million dollars) and that it owes a lot to the tradition of big spectacle C. C. DeMille. Nevertheless, I think it is an excellent movie, with an intrinsic depth that is comparable to 'Gladiator'. I don't care if the story follows Homeros' illiad faithfully or not. Without doubt, Homeros 'invented' a lot of things in his Troy story too (it even can't be proven that there is some historical truth to it; except for the fact that Troy has really existed as an ancient city), so it's surely good enough that the movie is only inspired on the Illiad. The scenes are impressive, the costumes are adequate, the overall acting performances are very good to excellent. Only Diana Kruger as Helen really disappointed me: she plays without any inner conviction, her performance was terribly insipid. Achilles and Hector convinced me both as true heroes; both heroes of the sword for sure, but with totally different personalities. Some battle scenes, especially the 'main' one between Achilles and Hector, are breath taking and all the more impressive in that they are 'real' (well, almost completely real that is). There is a lot to be discovered beyond the surface of this movie (was also the case with 'Gladiator'). Despite what some critics said (where are the good movie critics nowadays?), the performance of Brad Pitt as Achilles was not one dimensional at all. Achilles surely appears as an egotist (which he also is in Homeros' Illiad itself), but at the same time as a fairly complex person, with a couple of very good brains. Moreover, his personality evolves during the movie, with two encounters as driving force behind his evolution: the one with Brise√Øs (another good acting performance of Troy, realized by Rose Byrne) and the one with Priam (an excellent Peter O'Toole). I surely also loved the character of Hector, but didn't we all? As to Paris, well, he surely acted foolishly and irresponsible, but at the same time, his love for Helen seems to have been genuine (although this aspect isn't rendered convincingly in the movie, also due to the weak performance by Diane Kruger). There is a lot more to be said about this movie, but for now, I conclude with the statement I started with: this is an excellent movie, the best I saw this year until now.",10,3,5,4 August 2004
Salt," Absolute RUBBISH
","Everything in this movie is absolute rubbish: the plot, the filming, the stunts. Everything is also absolutely implausible. The intention was perhaps to create a kind of 'Bourne'-movie with a female hero. It absolutely failed, believe me. Save you time and money and don't watch this absolute failure. Folks, Salt is a wretched narrative quagmire. I am talking about an all-out cinematic disaster based on an utterly preposterous premise, unbelievable plot moves, flat acting, and a horrid ending. Not only this, but it is incredibly out-dated and out-modded, being both set and made at least 20 years too late in the history of the world for any success at all.I am horrified that the critics recorded a 61% tomato meter for Salt on RottenTomatoes.com. This is a disgrace. That is not just a failure on the part of the critical community, it is an indictment. You guys f***d up completely.",1,5,11,23 September 2012
