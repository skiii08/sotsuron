The King's Speech," My favorite film of 2010 by a long shot!
","Tom Hooper last blew viewers away with his critically praised HBO miniseries 'John Adams', which starred Paul Giamati in the title role. Now, he returns to his native England to tell a bit of a different story.Prince Albert, The Duke of York (Colin Firth) is in a bit of a rough spot. His father, King Goerge V is dying. With his father's deminishing health, all of the King's messages are delivered to the people of England via radio, and it's up to people like Albert to delever those messages to his people. The only problem is that Albert, or Bertie to his family, has suffered from a severe stutter since the age of 5. Despite the fact that he's seen every single speech therapist and specialist on the entire continent, his wife (Helana Bonnam Carter) stills feels that there's hope for her husband. So, against his wishes, she hires an eccentric Australian Speech Therapist named Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush). If Logue fails, then nothing can help Bertie.Logue and Bertie don't exactly hit it off, and their freindship, as well as Bertie's life is filled with speed bumps including the death of his father, the fact that his brother, David, will be the new king, and the fact that David (Guy Pearce) is marrying a woman named Wallis Simpson, an American who has been married twice. After David finds himself unfit to rule, he avdocates the throne to his younger brother. Unfortionatly, soon after Bertie takes the throne, Adolf Hitler announces his plans to attack England. This shoves the country into WWII, and forces Bertie to conquer his fears.Firth and Rush are at their best here, playing two very unique people who form an even odder bond. What makes this film all the more remarkable is the fact that both Albert, who later became King George VI, and Lionel Logue both existed in real life, as do many of the otehr characters, including Bertie's young daughter, Elizabeth. Fantastic cameos by actors like Derek Jacobi as the Archbishop, Cosmo Lange, and Timothy Spall as Winston Chirchill. But NOTHING can take away from the spellbinding performances by Colin Firth and Geffrey Rush",10,0,1,25 December 2010
The Avengers," An absolutely BREATHTAKING experience. Nothing sort of entirely remarkable
","I am a relatively new convert to the world of Marvel. I did not grow up reading comic books, or knowing ANYTNIG about these iconic characters. My experience with Marvel began in 2008, when I first saw 'Iron Man' in theaters, and fell in love with it. I was blown away by the level of storytelling and ESPECIALLY by Robert Downey Jr.'s phenomenal performance as Tony Stark. That movie shaped my idea of what storytelling and what movies could be. I kind of put that movie in the back of my mind for two years, but, when Iron Man 2 released in 2010, I TRULY began my love of Superhero movies. Over the next two years, I immersed myself in the Marvel universe. I have been blown away by Iron Man 2, Thor, AND Captain America: The First Avenger. All of those movies have been fantastic as stand alone movies. But, Joss Wheadon, the man who gave us the TV adaptation of 'Buffy The Vanpire Slayer', 'Firefly', and it's follow-up 'Sernity', SOMEHOW finds a way to bring all these standalone characters and the elements of the past movies in the Marvel Universe and combines them perfectly together to make something wholly original, intelligent, and extremely breathtaking.After Loki (Tom Hiddelston) comes to Earth from the otherworldly kingdom of Asguard and decides that these new people, and this new planet, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the leader of a government agency called S.H.I.E.L.D., is forced to bring together the world's most powerful superheros, Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Dr. Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) together in order to combat his menace. Along with S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Natasah Romanov/Black Widow (Scarlett Johannsen) and Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jermey Renner), the heroes must battle Loki's 'Army'.What makes this movie GREAT is the fact that the Avengers don't get along well, at ALL, when they first meet. Captain America and Iron Man take an immediate dislike to one another, and no one seems to like Thor, as he disagrees with Cap. and Iron Man on just about everything. These confrontations make for some of the FUNNIEST scenes in the movie. THis is a deeper, more philosophical and mature Super hero movie, while STILL being an entertaining, fun, popcorn movie, while STILL being the BEST Superrhero movie OF ALL TIME. This is more than JUST an action/adventure/popcorn movie. This is every sense of the term, a MASTERPIECE of filmmaking. I would say that this movie is worth seeing if you've seen ANY of the other Marbel films, or even if you've never seen the movies, Wheadon does a damn good job filling in all the blanks of the past movies perfectly for those who haven't seen them. Either way, SEE THIS MOVIE, see it in 3D, if possible.",10,2,6,8 May 2012
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Fufills everything it sets out to be: a fun waste of a couple hours.
","Honestly, I had some pretty high hopes for this movie, and I knew I would enjoy it. Well, I did. It is the best film of the summer so far (no offense Jon Faveru. I DID enjoy Iron Man 2)When a nine year old street urchin named Dastan is plucked off the streets by the King of Persia, it immediately sets him up for one of the greatest adventures ever.15 years later, Dastan has built up a reputation for making hasty and rash decisions, much to the dismay of his two brothers and his uncle, Nazim. So, when he captures Alamut, a town that is believed to be supplying weapons to Persia's foes, the entire empire rejoices, and the king comes out of exile for the occasion. At the large banquet, Dastan gives the King the prayer robes of Alamut, which instantly begins sparking and catches on fire, almost instantly killing the King. Dastan is blaimed for the crime, because he was the only one who actually handled the robe, and he flees the town with Tamina, Princess of Alamut.Dastan's older brother, Tus is given control over the kingdom and offers a hefty reward for anyone who returns his brother alive.Dastan and Tamina run across a shady business man, named Sheik Aman, who accepts Dastan's lies, but then discovers his true identity and attempts to return him to Tus.",10,4,9,5 June 2010
The Polar Express," A simply magical, holiday classic.
","While it doesn't stick very closely with it's source material, Chris Van Allisberg's 1988 novel of the same name, The Polar Express is a simply remarkable cinematic experience.The plot, much like the book, centers on a young boy living in Grand Rapids, MI in the 1950s (Which happens to be the same time Van Allisberg grew up, meaning that the main character may very well represent, or even BE Van Allisberg at a young age), who doubts the existence of Santa Claus. On Christmas Eve, he has the remarkable experience of riding a magical train, called the Polar Express to the North Pole. The film features a cast of very eccentric characters, many of which are voiced (the film is made in Stop-Motion animation) by the film's executive producer, and the main reason the film exists, Tom Hanks (Hanks enjoyed reading this story to his children when they were young, and he came up wtih the idea to make a movie out of it, and then proposed the idea to the screenwriter, and director Robert Zemecis, who has since gone on to make the stop motion animated films Beowulf, and one of my other favorite Christmas movies, 2009s A Christmas Carol, with Jim Carrey.) Hanks provides the voices for, Hero Boy, the boy's Father, the train's Conductor, a mysterious, almost angel like Hobo, a puppet version of Scrooge (which is ironic seeing as how Zemecis later made A Christmas Carol in Stop-Motion), and Santa Claus. The film also includes one of Michael Jeeter's last films, and in this one, he plays the comical engineer and fireman Steamer and Smokey. If you've never seen it, it is truly a beautiful film about believing in your dreams.",10,1,4,9 November 2010
Hugo," An absolutely MAGICAL film! A work of ART
","Three years ago, I picked up a book that I knew almost NOTHING about, save a couple of paragraphs of a review that I had read. That book was 'The Invention of Hugo Cabret', the debut novel of established illustrator Brian Selznick. Faithful to his previous illustration work, Selznick chose to tell his story in a rather unusual fashion- using pictures and words. But 'The Invention of Hugo Cabret' is far from a GRAPHIC NOVEL. It is a novel with some breathtaking sketches. When I read that Martin Scorsessee was attached to adapt the book into a movie, in 3D no less, I was actually VERY excited. I felt that 3D was the BEST way to tackle such a visual novel, and it turns out that I was right, in some ways. Scorsessee's adaptation of the novel, which went through several title changes before settling with 'Hugo', received much praise for it's storytelling, and especially for its use of the 'overrated' medium of 3D, particularly from 'Avatar' and 'Titanic' director James Cameron, who called the film the 'Best use of 3D ever.' Mr. Cameron knows his 3D, I trusted his word, and rightly so. As soon as the opening credits started, I became fully aware that I was in for a REAL TREAT.'Hugo' is the story of a young orphan, Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield), who lives in the Paris train station during the 1930s. He has been alone since his father (Played in flashbacks by Jude Law) was killed in a tragic fire, and his uncle Claude (Ray Winstone), a frequently drunk man who worked as the timekeeper at the station disappeared. Hugo must move throughout the train station carefully, so to avoid the watchful eyes of Gustave (Sacha Baron-Cohen), the often comical station inspector. It's his sneakiness that gets him in trouble with an aging man known as Papa Georges (Sir Ben Kingsley), who runs a small toy stand at the station. Along with Georges' god-daughter, Isabel, Hugo embarks on a journey that is equal parts remarkable and magical, and one that is filled with long- lost secrets from the past. 'Hugo' is FAR from a carbon copy of Selznick's REMARKABLE novel, but it IS remarkable in it's own right. Scorsessee and his team PERFECTLY capture the look and feel of the novel's settings, and ESPECIALLY the characters. In the end, this is certainly Scorsessee's love letter to classic cinema, and to the French Filmmakers who he truly admires and looks up to. By the time the film ended, I was left truly moved, and with the impression that I had just had one of the most MAGICAL movie going experiences of my life.",10,13,20,26 November 2011
Stardust," More than just a fairy tale
","A philosopher once asked, 'Are we human because we gaze at the stars, or do we gaze at them because we are human?' Pointless, really... 'Do the stars gaze back?' Now *that's* a question. And, so begins the unlikely, and incredibly inventive tale that is Stardust. Stardust begins with a young man named Dunstan Thorne (palayed by Ben Barnes, one year before his breakout role as Prince Caspian in the second Chornicales of Narnia film) lives in a town in England known as Wall, for the stone wall that has surrounded the town for 150 years. No one knows what lies beyond the wall, because no one has ever gone beyond the confinement. But, Dunstan Thorne breaks that streak, by venturing beyond the wall, and into the magical realm known as Stormhold. While there, he meets a beautiful woman who he has a short, but memorable affair with. He then returns to Wall, but 9 months later, the elderly gate watchman (David Kelly) arrives at Dunstan's home with a baby, which he claims belongs to Dunstan. The young boy is named Tristan (played as an adult by Charlie Cox). Tristan is smitten with the beautiful Victoria (Seienna Miller), who is dating an asshole named Humphrey. One night, Tristan gets his wish of spending more than a few seconds in with his true love. Meenwhile, the King of Stormhold (Peter O'Toole) lays on his death bed. 3 of his seven sons still remain alive, because the only remaining one is crowned king after their father dies. Two brothers (Rupert Everet and Mark Strong) plot the death of the third brother by pushing home out the castle window. The King tells the two remaining brothers that the first one to retrieve his necklace will be crowned king. He then chucks the necklace into the sky.The necklace hurtles through space, knocking a star out of the sky. The star crashes to Earth, but not before it's seen by Tristian and Victoria. The two make a bet that if Tristian can go beyond the wall and return the star before Victoria's birthday, in a week, then the two will be married. Using a strange candle given to him by his mother, called a Babylon Candle, which posses the power to transport a person hundreds of miles in the blink of an eye, Tristain ends up in the middle of a crater, with a strange girl. The girl, named Yvaine (Claire Danes) turns out to the human form of the fallen star. The two set out on the 100 mile journey back to Stormhold.Along the way, they encounter a cast of quirky character including a witch (played by Michelle Pheifer) who is obsessed with looking young, a band of lightning collecting pirates lead by Captain Shakespeare (Robert De Nero), and a black market trader named Ferdy (Ricky Gervais.)For those who did not see this film when it opened in theaters back in 2007, simply because it looked like a fairy tale, you missed out on one of the most entertaining films of the decade. Yes, it is a fairy tale, but, overall, it is simply an epic fantasy, albeit an epic fantasy where you know that the two main characters are going to get married in the end, director Mathew Vaughn, who made his directorial debut in 2004 with the mob thriller, Layer Cake, starring Daniel Craig, and most recently directed Kick-Ass with Chloe Moretz and Nick Cage, takes some interesting paths in arriving at that point. It wasn't hard for me to fall in love with this movie, which Vaughn adapted from the Neal Gaiman novel of the same name.",10,2,3,24 November 2010
The Artist," Equal parts beautiful, Eerie, atmospheric, charming, and ORIGINAL
","'The Artist' is one of those films that you go into not expecting very much out of it, and, in the end, you're left truly moved, and inspired. This film is certainly unconventional, but that adds to what makes it so GREAT! The year is 1927, the place, Hollywood. George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is one of the most successful and beloved silent movie stars, and along with his canine companion and sidekick, Uggie, charms his ways through Hollywood. While making his newest movie, George meets an up and coming dancer and actress, Peppy Miller, who dreams of making it big, and the two start an unusual friendship/partnership, which makes George's already jealous wife (Penelope Anne Miller) even MORE jealous, because she believes that there is something more between the two coworkers One day, the director of George's newest film, and a frequent collaborator and close friend (John Goodman) shows George something new, something that he calls 'the future'- movies with sound, or Talkies. For some reason, George is not willing to speak in the movies, and is convinced, as is everyone else, that he will soon become a thing of the past.Over the next few years, Peppy becomes one of the hottest stars in Hollywood, while George sinks deeper and deeper into obscurity. When his next movie, 'Tears of Love' opens alongside Peppy's newest Talkie, and proceeds to bomb, he slumps into a deep depression that leads him to fire his butler and closest friend, Clifton (James Cromwell), and on two occasions, attempts to commit suicide, until Peppy comes to his rescue, and saves not only his life, but also his career.What makes 'The Artist' so terrific is the director and cinematographer's decision to shoot the film in black and white, and make it silent, to add to the authenticity of the time period and the subject. The added bonus of VERY FEW duologue cards allows the audience the opportunity to create duologue between the characters. Combine that with Ludovic Borec's score, which ALSO fits the time period, and you have one hell of a authentic film set in the 1920s. The chemistry between Jean Dujardin and Bernece Bejo is ELECTRIC, and their performances speak magnitudes even though the film is silent. This is ONE HELL of an amazing movie, and it leaves you speechless after the film ends.",10,8,15,27 February 2012
The Fountain," A beautiful, but very strange, hymn to life, death, and love
","Darren Arenofsky has created an EXTREMELY original film in The Fountain. And, while it may not connect with most people, I found it to be beautiful.Tommy(Hugh Jackman) and his wife Izzi(Rachel Weiz) live an idyllic life in the 21st century. But, appearances are never as they seem. Tommy is a brilliant scientist. His goal: cure Izzi, who is dying of Cancer. But, before Izzi dies, she plans to finish the book she's been writing, a book titled The Fountain. The Fountain details the following story: In The 1500s, Queen Isabella of Spain sends her best Conquistidor, Thomas to the jungles of Mexico to hunt for a mysterious hidden temple of the Mayan people. According to Mayan legend, the Mayan creator, First Father, sacrificed himself in this temple in order to create the Mayan people. His body became a tree, and his soul, its branches. This is known to the Mayans as The Tree of Life. It is said that anyone that drinks its sap will be able to live forever. She gives Thomas a ring, and tells him that if he should find the tree, and he returns to Spain, he and the Queen will be married, and together, they shall live forever.Tommy seems to recall these events as if he has lived them himself. But, seeing as there is 500 years difference, that is physically impossible. Except, that is, if Thomas found the Tree of Life.In the year 2500, a aging Tommy is reacing through Space in a strange bubble. The only company he has is a tree, which is the body of his deceased wife, Izzi. His target, the Mayan underworld, Xibalba (pronounced 'shibalba'),which is, in actuality, a Nebula wrapping around a dying star. Tommy is heading here in order to be reborn, so he can live with Izzi forever.As odd as this film sounds, everything ties together in the end, and makes a strange but powerful tale of one man's undying love for the woman he loves, and how far he will go to be with her forever",10,1,3,18 January 2011
Inception," A truly exceptional experience. A TRUE Masterpiece.
","Christopher Nolan's follow up to the Dark Knight, Inception, is both incredibly complex, but seamlessly weaved together at the same time.Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a master of Subconscious Espionge, which is basically going inside people's dreams and stealing their most intent secrets. But, when a mysterious Japanese business man named Saito (Ken Wannabe) hires Cobb and his assistant Arthur (Joesiph Gordon-Levitt) to preform Inception, a process which many believe is impossible, on Robert Fischer Jr. (Cillian Murphy), the son of illustrious energy Mogul Maurice Fischer, Cobb willingly accepts. The process of Inception involves entering a person's mind and planting an idea in their mind. In this case, Saito want Cobb to put the thought 'I Will Destroy my Father's company' in Fischer's mind, therefor making Saito's company the leader in the energy business. Cobb then must assemble the team to preform the Inception. The team consists of The Arcitect, Andrale (Ellen Page), a brilliant college student, The Forger, Aems (Tom Hardy), and Yeusef (Deliep Rao) The Arcitect's job is to create the world of the dream, a sort of maze that is filled with the dreamer's subconscious in human form. If the maze is to simple, the subconscious will hunt down the Arcitect and beat him/her. The Forger is responsible for creating the weapons used while in the mind.Cobb is also haunted by the vision of his late wife, Mal (Marion Coltairad), who lived with Cobb in an area of the mind known as Limbo, which they created, for over fifty years, bit then, became possessed with the idea that the real world was simply a dream, and then killed herself by jumping off the balcony of a hotel. Cobb is forced to live in Paris, where his father, Miles (Micheal Caine), is a college professor, because everyone in his family believes that he killed Mal, simply because he planted that idea in her mind.Inception pulls of some inceadible feats and doesn't cease to amaze, even with a running time of 2 and a half hours.Final Grade: A+. The summer's BEST movie!",10,2,6,20 July 2010
Despicable Me," Hilarity and heart are a great mix for this Excellent movie!
","Despicable Me, the new animated from produced by Chris Melandandri, who also produced Ice Age: The Meltdown and Horton Hears A Who, is one of the summer's stand out movies. Steve Carell, Jason Segel, Miranda Cosgrove, and Russell Brand are perfect actors to lead this at times hilarious, at times tear jerking animated tale. Will Arnett, Kristen Wiig, Danny R. McBride, Julie Andrews and Jermain Clement make for a worthy supporting cast.Gru (voiced by Carell) is a evil genius who only wants to win the affection of his cold-hearted mother (voiced by Andrews), something he has NEVER had. His only friends are Dr. Nefario, a aging scientist (voiced by Brand), and his army of minions (voiced by directors Peiere Coffin and Chris Reneud, and Jermain Clement), Twinky like creatures with both one and two eyes, it varies. When a mysterious newcomer named Vector (voiced by Segal) steals the Great Pyrimid of Giza, Gru decides to pull off the greatest heist EVER: stealing the moon! Then, three orphan girls, Margo (voiced by Cosgrove), Edith, and Agnes (both voiced by newcomers who names I don't know.) The three of them don't hit it off with Gru instantly, but they see him as the first real parent they've ever had. Gru slowly begins to warm up to the girls, and they're interactions make for some truly heartfelt, and also hilarious moments. Case in point:Edith: Are these beds old bombs? Gru: Yes. But, they are very old and highly unlikely to blow up. Try not to toss and turn.Despicable Me pulls off something almost unheard of: a film that is enjoyable for both parents and children that does NOT involve humor centered around bodily functions, or violence. Final grade: A Plus infinite number of times!",10,81,116,9 July 2010
Up in the Air," An unconventional, but remarkable movie. An instant classic!
","Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is a Road Warrior. No, this does NOT mean he's going to be replacing Mel Gibson in the next Mad Max movie, also titled Road Warrior. No, it simply means he's payed to fire people, or as he puts it 'I work for a company run by a bunch of Pussies who don't have the balls to sack their own employees.' Unlike his family, Bingham doesn't believe that he is secluding himself from the world, but rather, surrounding himself with people.When a recent college graduate named Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), persuades Craig Gregory (Jason Bateman), Bingham's employer, as well as all the other people who work with him, to do all the firing via computer, all the Hatchetmen, including Bingham, are grounded. Because she has eventually ruined his way of life, Bingham takes an instant dislike to Keener, but when Craig gives him the job of showing her the ropes, Bingham must learn to cope.After Keener's boyfriend dumps her via text message while they're on the road, Bingham decides to be a bit nicer to Keener, eventually becoming one of her closer friends.While Bingham is adjusting to having a traveling companion, he meets Alex (Vera Farmiga). Alex, who is also a hatchetman, and Ryan begin a strange relationship which comes crashing down in the film's conclusion.While Ryan Bingham isn't the kind of guy that you'd normally like, you find yourself rooting for him, and the rest of the characters in the humanly real, and darkly funny film that plays almost like a documentary than a drama.The film's conclusion isn't predictable, to say the least, but that's just how director Jason Rietman, who adapted the screenplay from Walter Kern's novel of the same name, wants it. And, while it isn't for everyone, if you like George Clooney, offbeat film, or Reitman's last directorial success Juno, this film is Definitely worth your time.",10,0,2,2 August 2010
