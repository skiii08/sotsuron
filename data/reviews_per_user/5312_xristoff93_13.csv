The Expendables 2," The definition of good old badassery
","You have to know something before watching this movie.You have to know what are you going to watch.I read some reviews here and I got confused.Were guys expecting to see something classy,with people wearing costumes,talking politely about philosophy or world peace while in the background we hear 'swan lake'?If this is the case,this is certainly not a movie for you.Watching this,I was expecting exactly what I was given.Full action packed film,superficial and violent bloodshed and explosions.I mean,you get conversations that barely make any sense,fancy karate gimmicks,knife acrobatics,vadam signature kicks,Chuck Norris destroying a whole army with his smile,car doors getting ripped out by mere hands,plane-landings in plutonium mines,tons of explosions,brutal jokes between the most brutal faces of cinematic history all in one....What's not to love?I enjoyed the action and laughed quite a bit.The story was very simple-maybe a bit poor even-but you do not watch a Stallone-Norris- Arnold-Willis-vadam-statham etc etc movie for it's rich scenario.It gets an 8/10 from me.It's superficial movie but since you watch it for the action,you won't be disappointed.",8,0,0,14 September 2016
It," Did I miss something?
","-I was hearing all this noise around this movie and having not seen the older version of 'IT' I came to believe that it would be something pretty scary.
-But what was that? A small group of kids, running around, in splatter scenes, throwing adult humour all over the place and bad language....It was so confusing. I was feeling like I was watching a children's movie from a messed up producer. There was nothing scary, no tension, no anything... In many parts it felt like a bunch of random scenes thrown in together to hastily make a film.
-And it felt kinda wrong the thought that the target group of this film was young...much younger than it should be....
-I am giving it a 5 out of 10 because it made laugh so hard!!I wasn't expecting this from a horror film(?).....",5,8,15,6 February 2018
If I Stay," Life,a teen love story,music and a little a bit shallowness
","The movie is definitely gets you from the beginning.It makes you wanna see what happens next.We don't have the typical high school romance with the top athlete and the cheerleader,saying love you after a couple of weeks and then breaking up over who ate the last piece of chocolate or something idiotic like that.We do have a cool kid though.He is a guitar player and part of a band.He is a small star in his school.He notices a quite girl,modest and serious(not slut) who also has a fancy in music,though a different kind than his.He's stuck with her from the beginning and it is obvious that it matters cause that did not happen only due to her looks.The female character is a bit more shallow though and you can pick that up almost from the beginning.I mean she's left speechless because the school's star is talking to her.Made me wonder how would she react to him,if he wasn't someone.Throughout the entire movie you can enjoy various music tracks,either rock-like or classical music.I liked this film because the characters are so vivid,even Mia's parents.And they happen to be pretty cool.The feeling are genuine.But after the first half of the movie and the accident,which actually shows how things can change dramatically in a blink of an eye,things begin to be a bit more shallow.The acting was pretty much solid...I had some issue's with Mia.I am not sure she's mature enough as an actor yet to convince that she really feels love and pain.There were some scenes while she is in her 'spirit form' that felt quite awkward.Also the whole genuine feeling thing,is reduced to almost a typical high school one sided romance.Mia's makes plans with Adam,he seems mature and sure of his decisions and in no case does he take or try to take advantage of her,and that was sweet and heartwarming.The thing that bothered me is that Mia is portrayed to be a bit wavy in her mind at times,reasonable since she is a teenager,but then not only lies to Adam and takes-without him-a different path than the one they chose together,but also blames things on him.The writing here was bad since we have another unreasonable character with unreasonable demands and at the end,the one who should be angry at this situation ends up apologizing and calling himself an a**h*le,like he did something wrong.Then we have the typical bul*sh*t 'You shouldn't be worried about me getting to Juliard,they won't pick me for an audition'....'Oh they picked me for an audition,but you should not worry cause I won't pass anyway' and so on so on....Last thing that put me off,was the ending.OK,she lost her parents and brother,and that is really awful,but she still has a family,friends and a boy who loves her more than anything.Everyone is there trying to support her in any way they can but she is just too hurt to want to survive this life anymore??Are you kidding me?? You stay alive for you!!For YOUR life!!Bad things will happen but you must continue,not stay down and kill over every time things aren't great.Despite everyone appearing and talking to her and showing to her how many reason she still has for living,she cares not about grandparents,friends and boyfriend,but sure when he reads her the letter from the music school Juliard and she passed,she gets moved and decides to live???.....Right there felt like a silly twilight romance to me....So while there is solid acting,vivid characters,nice story telling and music,the second half of the movie lacks depth and the writing could be better.I liked it but I am skeptical cause it felt a bit shallow at the end.Nothing like 'The perks of being a wallflower'...So it's a 6/10 from me.",6,0,0,13 September 2016
Alexander," At least they got some names right..........................
","I have been putting off to watch this movie,since I've heard a lot about it and nothing was good.Now I understand why....The movie seems like a b-movie from the very beginning.I was tempted to stop it but thought'It's about the greatest ancient war master,I should know how they portray him here'..Well,it was painful!It was so distasteful I do not know where to begin.Phillip the second(something I believe was never stated in the movie,not even once...the second)is portrayed as goat herding one- eyed homosexual rapist savage.Olympia looks younger than her own son,apparently was raised in mother RUSSHA but was probably born in some exotic island,and had some weird fetish with snakes,always acting like an obvious plotter straight out of the 'gossip girl' series and with some awkwardly flirtish tendencies towards her child.It was sickening.Did they even read what this movie was supposed to be about?Obviously not!Alexander and his best friend had eyeliners throughout the entire film,I am sure that was a thing back in the day,right!?And then all kind of ridiculous scenes happen....Public rape of a young boy in Phillip's wedding feast,Phillip-Alexander public fight with insults that were thought to be pretty bad back then,but the next day you see them riding side by side laughing,Alexander mouth kissing his mother,his hair looked like they were done with the cheapest of hair-colors,every ten minutes we had a 20 minute long monologue from Alexander deprived though of any emotion.The fight scenes reminded me of the series 'hercules' with Kevin Sorbo,totally laughable.Everything was absolutely cheap about this film.From their very cloths up to their supposed to be great marble statues...But the directors seemed to have a different opinion since they replaced every great work of ancient Greeks with plastic human size figures.The lack of seriousness and the complete absence of any respect at all to history and to one of it's greatest sons was suffocating.Even a 7 year old would laugh or get bored with this.Many scenes could easily come from 1960s films.Alexander the Great was the best tactician of the ancient world,he conquered almost the entire known world,he was a talented leader,a great warrior and a genius at strategy.Did we ever see that here?No...It could easily be a film about some fake blonde Persian prince with an enormous fortune and army.The directors were more focused on showing us sleazy gay scenes,ridiculous half naked men dancing like trumpets in a Babylonian cheap brothel than building up the character of the greatest war master of history.This was not Alexander and there was nothing great about this film.If we were asked to rate the disrespect,lack of knowledge and any talent in camera play,screen writing and story telling behind this absolute piece of garbage,then I could say that they were the greatest(=lamest).Even the basics were all wrong.Macedonia keeps been referred to as something different to Greece itself.They were indeed divided in city-states and Macedonia was one of them.They make it sound like all the other city-states make out Greece and Macedonia is something else.Hollywood never fails to disappoint!!I could go on for hours,but since most of these stuff were also mentioned by others and since there is no point making myself feel even worse from this abomination I suffered,I shall stop here.If this was Hollywood's attempt to portray Alexander the Great,they managed to create a complete and utter failure of a 'historical' based movie. 1 out of 10",3,2,2,12 October 2016
Troy," Irrelavant with the original story,bad directing,costumes,weapons etc all wrong
","Contains spoilersIt was a great disappointment to say the least.They took one of the most epic stories I have ever read and turned it into nothing but classical Hollywood drama with jealousy games,disgusting leaders and filthy back stabbings that totally changed the whole nature of these heroes' deeds.Where is Nestor and Diomides?Odysseas was like a sneaky adviser.Agamemnon was a fat and perverted old man,chasing after the myth of his own self and Menelaus just another fat old gizzer waving his sword slowly while waiting for Pares to attack(I almost cried from laughter in that scene).Achilles never had such a romantic affair with a woman,he never entered Troy,but died before that from a single poisoned arrow from Pares(guided by a god)on the Achilles tenod.Agamemnon died from Briseas??????For **** sake!Agamemnon was heroic and strong,the leader of the greatest army of that era,in a war that lasted almost ten years.And was murdered by his cheating wife and lover when he returned home.He was later avenged by his son.Ais killed himself,in one of the most amazing scenes in the whole story.Not killed in a brainless brutality with Hector.Ais' death signified how politicians take what the people earn with their sweat and blood. No one left Troy alive and there was no such thing as a sword of Troy.Hector's son was thrown over the cliff.And where is that amazing woman that became the reason for such a war?The armors now....were completely ridiculous.They were like they were sewn rather than forged.The shields looked like potato chips and every piece of clothing and hairstyle was totally pathetic.It was a feminine look to say the least.The old warriors of the past were reduced into nothing but brainless old idiots who fought over *ussy and dressed like *aggots!No heroism,no epicness....Boring and insulting!",4,1,3,16 July 2015
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Kids will love it....You will not! This was 'United colous of super goofy'
","-This could very easily be the worst spider man movie I've ever watched. For starters, this was more like super goofy! Forced jokes all over the place, a continuing silliness in every scene. And many many many efforts for antiracism. Was this spider man or an activist promotion film?So peter parker's best friend is a fat asian kid now,his high schooll bully is indian(flash) and an overall decent kid and student,his crush is african american and mary jane is an ebony(?) stalker, always following parker around and her name is 'MJ for her friends' while her name is not Mary Jane at all?What?!And shocker is a useless white guy killed off by another white guy only to be replaced by another useless guy, but this time black!?And Parker himself is kinda redhead with freckles?
-Besides that, the plot was weak, the pace was uneven and the story telling was poor to say the least, resulting in a cringy and kinda boring film. Spider man was goofing around all the time, he seemed extremely weak and useless. And that would be fine if they had not previously presented him in 'civil war' as a guy who could fight captain america on equal footing ,and that while being able to afford more goofing around at the time. No continuity whatsover. As for story telling etc...look at the beginning: And here we have SPIDER MAN!!DA TA!...Of course we all know about spider man but shouldn't they show us how he got his powers?How his parents or uncle die?Especially his uncle's death was supposed to be a critical moment in spider man's character shaping.And what about people who have not seen or read about spider-man before,how will they know how he got his powers and what his powers are exactly?I mean, these things are pretty basic. And what about the villains?Do all trash disposal companies hire MIT graduates to get rid of trash and ruins or is it that easy for anyone to hack and modify alien technology and reshape it into human-style weapons? Another thing, his friend was such a genius at computers that could easily hack the high tech suit Iron Man gave him?Like that?And without Stark getting wind of it?Then we have Iron Man coming up and sticking together a boat while it's flooding and he just flies away like that?And what about his aunt?She was more like his older and smoking hot stepsister. Ans she finds out his secret like that? And I can go on and on but I thing you get the picture here. And what about Shocker?He is black now?After Electro who was also made to be black in the previous reboot?And I do not care about the colour of his skin. He could be pakistani for all I care. But there is no point presenting us with a story only to change it later for a political(ly correct) agenda. It is a matter of continuity.Black torch,black electro,black shocker.Are we looking forward to an all black hero and villain series so that people won't call you racist? Changing a character or story in general for that reason, is racist by itself.And to be clear on that, I am not racist.I like all people if they're nice.
-Both after credits scenes were pointless even though the second one was kinda funny.
-All in all, we have another Hollywood eyecandy, with no plot, no feeling behind the characters, a very weak and kinda unlikable protagonist and dull fights with explosive endings.It was good for wasting a couple of hours but this was not spider man.If that is what they make spider man to be from now on, I do not like it. At least kids will probably like it. What shame.......",5,2,3,21 January 2018
Blade II," Okay.......I guess................
","I am a fan of dark fantasy movies like Underworld.So,I took up on Blade as well.The first one was OK as well even though the visual effects were not so good but that is understandable considering when it was made.I was hoping for an improvement at the second film.I didn't really see it.While the plot is very interesting especially in the beginning with the introduction of a new element,after a while the hype is gone.There are many reasons behind that.First of all,there are a lot of unnecessary bad-ass wannabe moments when many characters try to act tough with no reason at all.Second of all,full of silly clichés.The vamp squad's members names were all typical,tough and mighty,trying so hard to create some kind of badassery but fails since they are so weak.Their cloths and weapons,ridiculous gigantic hammers etc....They are just not that great.They had a fierce appearance but had a weak result.And what about those supposedly explosive punch metal things that Blade had?No one exploded...big fuss for nothing.A vampire squad of the very elites and they had no equipment??And almost none of them could fight?They were dropping dead like flies..Another thing that ruined it for me are the plot holes.In the first they appear with special outfits that protect them from light,but later on,when Blade suggests they fight the enemy in daylight,every seems confused,surprised and angry because they are saying they have no way to escape light.WHAT ON EARTH?Even in the previous movie,vamps could stand in daylight with mere sunscreen or wore black leather clothing and helmets.Yet in this one,sun light seems to burn even their clothes.No explanation of Damaskinus appearance.Why was he like that?Why did he look like he was sick?Why his blood was blackish?Also,Whistler acts like he is in his home,not caring much about the movie or what happens.Blade's complete lack of any emotion,may seem cool in the beginning,after a while it gets tiring.Priest was bitten and he started transforming almost immediately and Nisa too.Lighthammer was cool for like a whole day.A plot hole to create an element of surprise or suspense?Big fail....Nomak transformed anyone who bit him.In the end he was shown bitting numerous humans or vamps(whatever the guards were) but I suppose that doesn't help our story telling so we pretend it never happened,right?What about Blade?He seems to be really affected by brute force,bullets and electricity but in the final battle he gets smashed upon walls and pillars and he acts like he's been touched by butterfly wings.His chest is getting cracked and he sits up a second later but then,he gets punched and seems to be suffering.WHAT???Also,he is supposed to have all of a vampire's strengths but none of their weaknesses.So he is as strong and fast as any vampire...Then why any other vampire appears to be so weak when they come in comparison?There are may other plot holes and uncontinuities but I care not to list them all down.I believe all these are more than enough.In the end,we have a nice villain,creepy and strong.A biological mystery and a lot of shooting and fighting in dark places.On the other hand we have plot holes,bad acting,silly clichés and childish battle choreographies.It gets a 5/10 barely...",5,2,2,15 October 2016
Suicide Squad," After watching this,suicide could be the answer
","Maybe the worst movie I've been hyped to watch for a very long time!Bad plot,bad story telling,pretentious acting,over the top for no reason,a lot of completely unnecessary scenes and characters.Most of these villains were pretty much useless,like captain b...Some could have made a difference but the dialogue and scenario was pathetic.Robin made a despicable Harley queen.After watching this I really cannot understand why so much fuss for the whole movie and especially for Harley and joker.Silly lines all over the place,introduction scenes that meant nothing,no character development and the scenario was completely childish.So we are supposed to believe that the world was to be saved by a boomerang throwing mad man,a slutty dressed female baseball player,a samurai with bad taste in costumes and a crocman?I did not like most of the characters but especially for Jared and robin,every time they appeared on screen, I honestly begged for them to die in some way so I would not have to suffer another minute of their horrifying acting and the terrible way the director chose to portray the joker and Harley.Totally pretentious and the romantic factor was the silliest addition one could make.This movie ended leaving me sad and confused.My girlfriend even fall asleep!!(Go figure)...Sad because I was so hyped and expected so much more from all these characters.And confused because,how could such a distasteful movie have gotten so much hype and exciting reviews?? JUST HOW???Joker was a big letdown and Harley even more.I guess that's why every irrelevant person on this planet loved her and dressed like her during Halloween.....Makes sense....The good side is it had some decent visual effects and some nice explosions.Also Will Smith's acting was kinda nice but weak story line and dialogue here as well.Other than that it was a waste of time and expectations.",4,1,1,26 January 2017
Doctor Strange," Very good!!I was just expecting something a bit more serious
","We all know what Marvel does best and that is super explosive movies,with cool characters and a great sense of humor.Here though,it may have gotten a bit too much.We have a great cast and the action hits you right off the bat.The visual effects are something else.The only thing that seemed a bit pointless and fake were those seals everyone was making,creating a magic bright yellow kind of super complex polygon that in the end was disappearing without any impact at all.It seemed like they put it there just to show something fancy.The main actor was excellent,the drama,the suspense were very good and the ancient one was very interesting.She died though in a very simplistic way,leaving too many questions unanswered.Instead of making the best use they could of her character-and with that actor on the cast-it felt like she went to waste a bit.The main villain was good and mickelsen is one of my now almost favorite actors but the dialogue was a bit shallow and as a villain he was a bit weak.I mean Dr.Strange was only a few weeks rookie and he could fight him almost on even footing from their first encounter,killing or pushing off his followers.OK,Strange had a talent for it but the development was too quick,which means it was also too small.It gets a 7 out of 10.I was glad I saw Stan lee and the two after the credits scenes.They hyped me up for good!I only hoped they would use humour a bit less.It kinda spoiled many great moments in the film,making Dr.Strange looking more of a goof-like character instead of a great hero or sorcerer.And the fight against the main villain should full of awe instead of laughter,it is a marvel superhero movie after all,not looney tunes fighting off some aliens in a basketball court.",7,2,4,12 November 2016
X-Men: Days of Future Past," X-men?
","I've seen all the previous movies and I've been getting more and more disappointed as each movie comes out.I liked the original 3 movies and the origins of wolverine 1,despite deviations from the comic and some uncontinuities.The first class was quite good and then comes the origins of wolverine 2......Many deviations,magnetto is back(hidden scene),'wheels' is back and wolverine loses the adamantium claws(I mean com'on!!)etc and then this freakshow....New mutants out of the blue,storyline without any explanation,no explanation whatsoever for charls and magneto and kitty's powers and logan has his claws back,some scenes had very cheap action and wolverine goes back at a time when he was supposed to be with his brother(according to origins 1)but instead is found in a girls room,naked,starring his full steroid body from a mirror when some gangsters hop in.Quicksilver has his name for a reason as he dissappears as fast as he appears with no further mentioning and at the most important part wolverine gets tossed into a lake,stabbed with metal wire and left to drown.Somehow he gets saved and somehow he has his adamantium claws again and a new enemy appears at the end....WOW!! If you make a movie with no connection to the previous ones,stating loud and clear that there is no need for you to watch any of them in order to be able to watch this one then why would anyone watch them and not just watch this one?And what about all these fans that waited for so long for this next x-men step,for the continuation of their favourite story?What do they get?Nothing.....This movie was a letdown for me,I'm not sure I'm gonna pay to watch the next one. If it was just this movie,I would think it better,but it's not and that's what's it's all about the next movie of the same universe.",4,0,1,14 April 2015
It Follows," NOT what I expected
","I saw good reviews on this movie and I thought 'what the heck?Let's check it out!'.An easy thought since almost every horror movie I've seen lately was boring as a miley cirus song.It begins creating a sense of mystery and anticipation.You feel thrilled waiting for it to happen....You see how the evil gets from one person to another...you see the result of the evil after it catches its prey...So far so good.And you are left waiting for the story to really unfold and learn about what's going on,but that's it......!!Nothing... You see a couple of dead bodies without any real violence or anxiety for you to feel,you knew what was gonna happen and it happened like it didn't matter at all,predictable.Pointless shouting every now and then,screaming without anyone really knowing what is happening,a kinda scared protagonist that is left almost entirely speechless throughout the movie,with a lot of stares and blank looks,worried checking around,a silly,pointless game of running around on foot,by car,cycling,alone,with a partner,with a group,to her house,neighbours house,neighbours cottage,an old swimming pool,a school and back to the start.Walking down the road hand by hand and the creature still behind.....The end....Oh don't forget about the awkward conversation with the guy who gave her the 'bug'...Like he wasn;t even acting,not telling them anything he hasn't told her before,no pille up,no drama,no heat!Knock-knock and we sit in the grass like nothing has happened.... Are you F....ING kidding me?That's it? A classic horror story?The best after Insidious????A total waste of time....A quite original idea though,gone wasted.....",5,8,47,7 June 2015
Prometheus," Great film leaving things unexplained or just a good film coming out of piecing together many different ideas?
","I found acting and plot to be great,if not at times marvelous.Sceneries and visual effects were top notch!The idea of humans exploring space,roaming into the unknown,running into unpredictable and mysterious planets,stories or creatures has always fascinated me. And this film has a little bit of everything.It is interesting and fresh,while it won't only lose contact with the alien universe,but it will add to it.And this is what I love more in a good story.The cosmology/mythology behind the first installments.The beginning of everything,the establishing of a universe with certain 'rules' if I may that will make it something more than 'an original story from the before the 90's'.So we are given that,at least some pieces of it.Though nothing is unflawed.We have a nice intro and some agony pilling up slowly at the first and then it bursts out!The sad thing that many thing don't really make sense and some characters do things-to put it blunt- completely stupid,things you won't expect not only a scientist to do,but any reasonable human being.And yet there they stand,important scientists,chosen for a classified mission of great importance to explore the possible creators of mankind...And there are some in-continuities.And let me elaborate... 1.When they first enter the structure they see David using the foreign spacecraft technology and no one questions what had just happened. 2.When they enter the contaminated hall no one got infected.The vessels started acting up,creating something like humidity at first and then something like a gray jell that was moving,like there were worms inside.Then,in the ship Prometheus when David opened up a vessel and came in contact with the liquid inside,he was holding a drop on his finger and it did not get affected at all while he was holding it.Why? 3.In the vessel room we see worms crawling on the ground.No explanation about them and I guess later they turned into alien-like snakes? 4.When they examined the decapitated head that noticed new cells and after some time it exploded.Was he infected before he died?If so,shouldn't't't a creature come out of him?Instead he was destroyed like the engineer at the start of the film.Yet in alien covenant we are shown that contact with the virus equals some strange thing exploding out of your body. 5.While the engineer at the beginning got infected and destroyed almost immediately,when Hollowway got infected it took him many hours to show symptoms.And isn't a scientist inclined to step up when he notices something's wrong with his body?In a foreign planet? With a great possibility of infection considering what they had seen already? 6.A snake-like alien entered one of the crew members body but nothing came out of him,just the same creature that entered a few hours ago....??? 7.All of the engineers in the ship are dead.From we are shown probably they got infected in some kind of accidental lick.Their bodies though were not destroyed like portrayed at the start of the film.They were opened up like something came out of them.If that's the case why some lose their form and some become carriers of 'alien' creatures?And while many saw this from the crew no one cared enough to spare a comment?Apart from 'let's leave'? 8.Two of the crew members are not on board,yet no one stays in the bridge to monitor things in case of emergency?And the next morning no one watched any footage from last night?Like,did they all this technology but thought to spare some memory space and not keep all that documented data? 9.Elisabeth comes in contact with the virus through her mate but instead of getting sick,she got pregnant with a weird calamari-alien egg machine creature? 10.She then removes the alien from within her and she appears in front of her employer and many other crew members,covered in blood and with a huge scar on her belly and no one notices?Or no one cared? 11.In the vessel room there are some wall paintings.In one of them there is a creature portrayed that looks like an alien.That means that this creature is no stranger to the engineers,in fact they seem to treat it with great respect or fear considering the drawings.Yet at the end of the film the last engineer gets swallowed by a form of alien completely surprised....And what comes out is beautiful and creepy,but not like the alien we all know. 12.The engineer comes to from a 2 thousand year cryosleep and he wonders nothing,he just gets back on his plan to destroy Earth?And since these beings are so far greater than humans in technology,and since this ship seems to be on an organized base of theirs,how come no one ever sought them out from their race?And we know that there are others from the next film.. 13.The alien that came out from the engineer was kinda small,yet the aliens we see in Covenant that come from humans who are much smaller in size than the engineers,as a result of the same virus,are shown to be so much bigger. 14.The two lost scientists in the foreign structure meet up with a weird creature.They do not fear it,no second thoughts,no scientific spirit of examination.They treat it like a stray dog and end up dead from it.At least one of them.The other suffered some strange mutation who made him mad but super strong,because....reasons? 15.What actually happened at the beginning?Did that engineer sacrifice himself in order for life on Earth to blossom or was that something else entirely?I guess,if you look hard enough you will find more stuff like that,that do not add up or make any sense in a matter of continuity or leave things without explanation.I wish they had thought these things through.I liked the movie a lot but all these would satisfy my curiosity greatly.Sadly that is not the case.I was waiting for the gaps to be filled in the next film,but not only they do not fix the errors we see here,it is actually even worse,in fact beyond compare.",8,1,3,3 June 2017
Fifty Shades of Grey," There is actually a worse love story than Twilight
","Before watching this movie,I have witnessed the impact of the book.Out of the people I know,only girls/women actually bought and read it.It was the center of many scandalous conversations.From the beginning,I believed it to be thrash,mainly because as I mentioned above only girls(and blonde women from some stupid TV show in the morning zone)would talk about it and it's 'dark' sex scenes.So,even though I did not had my hopes up,I was expecting something provocative,something a bit porn/fetish like,something mainstream at least......My oh my,was I in for a surprise...The story is totally improbable,but let's say we decide to overlook that(it's a movie after all,don't need to get all realistic),the plot was going nowhere.A rich businessman with a dark door(literally) in his life,with strange appetites,a beautiful young girl with no experience,innocent but also willing to try the spices of an uncommon sex life...Nowhere near that!!There was no depth in the dialogues,they were stationery,with no essence,going in circles over nothing really.What you thought would be a kinky romance with some hard sex,was actually a messed up protagonist,very confused about what he wants,creepy and sadistic,aiming at a young girl who kept talking about what 'normal people do',pushing for her own suffering to happen,only to regret it seconds after,leaving him forever.It was obvious that the guy had problems but there was no character development,so we never learn anything that can be said in more than a sentence or two.There in so intensity anywhere,not even in the long awaited,by the masses,bdsm.I have seen butterflies f***k harder than this.There was no erotism,no romance,no drama.Just a pile of scenes,intended to look different from each other,each adding something to the movie(one drama,one romance,one depth),but with no success.The acting was not convincing to say the least and the awkwardness was so high in almost every minute of the movie that I look back at Twilight scenes and think'There is actually a worse love story than Twilight'.The only smart thing about this movie(smart in a commercial way)is that there is a ridiculously rich man involved in the story,so you get to see a bunch of serious money situations like rides with planes,helicopters,cars,huge houses with gardens,nice suits etc. and for a split second you get distracted from how hollow a movie this is....Or not :pI give this movie a 3 out of 10.The only reason for this,is that when younger,I was unlucky enough to watch some zombie movies from 1960 that were so horrible I couldn't even laugh or wait till their end.Those were worth 0-1 out of 10....That is why '50 shades of creepy/cringe and awkward' gets a 3 and not a 1.....So happy I did not pay to see this one,feelling bad for anyone that did.",3,0,0,14 July 2016
