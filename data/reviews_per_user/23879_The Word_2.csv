The Blair Witch Project," Hype
","After 3 attempts to get tickets to see this movie and waiting in line for 30 minutes to get into the theatre and reading the tremendous critic responses to this movie, I have to say I was disappointed after seeing it.The premise of the movie is interesting the way these 'kids' reacted was ludicrous. I think when most people are threatened with a 'force' whether known or unknown they take on a defensive posture like fabricating some sort of a weapon or a pointy stick and maybe building a giant bonfire to scare away the 'boogie' men?'The scariest movie ever?' My fear level was on low simmer throughout the movie and maybe spiked up for a brief moment near the end. The overabuse of the shakiness of the camera was becoming trite 30 minutes into the movie. Uhh... yes, I get it, its an amateur videotape, just don't beat me over the head with this concept. Sitting around the campfire telling ghost stories in the dark can be scary but it's not genius, let's move on. Night of the Living Dead or the Exorcist were scarier movies. Ever hear of these?",6,0,2,2 August 1999
Us," Dont believe the hype. Dont waste your time or money.
",I went to see this movie without seeing the reviews or knowing the plot and was utterly disappointed how bad this movie was as a horror genre and as a coherent story. Came out shaking my head at the end wondering that I actually paid to see this and wasted my time.I was then curious what this movie was rated by the critics and was again floored that it had garnered high praise and accolades. I'm dumbfounded. This is even worse than a made for tv movie. Don't waste your time or money.,1,162,294,22 March 2019
