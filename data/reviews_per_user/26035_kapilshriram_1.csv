Airlift," Ordinary one time watch patriotic movie
","Overall movie is average and really looks like a real story with super acting by Akshay Kumar and Nimrat Kaur. But on the basis of entertainment the first half of movie is not more than average.first part of movie was slightly slow. Overall the movie is better than the baby and phantom but not like the other patriotic movies like Rang De Basanti, Swadesh. At the same time they could have made the scene better when Indian Air force airlifted Thousands of people from Oman. The scene when Iraqi army attacked Kuwait was also look ordinary. They could have made serious scenes better An overall engaging watch with a few gritty moments, Airlift does stumble a few times as well. Blame it on the Bollywood audience but the filmmakers couldn't seem to let go of the masala and song-dance paraphernalia that goes with a moolah-raking star in a lead role. An 'Arabic' number is also thrown in for good measure. But in a film that hinges on realism, the songs are jarring.",6,6,20,23 January 2016
