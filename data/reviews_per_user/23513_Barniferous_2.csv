The Blair Witch Project," This movie sucked!
","DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! IT'S ALL A SCAM! This movie wasn't even scary, save about 5 minutes at the end, and it was just plain painful to watch. Sure the acting was good, but the slow, boring script made me want to bang my head into a wall for going to this piece of crap! Several people left early from my audience, and as soon as it was over, you could tell by the way everyone left grumbling that most of the other viewers felt the same. Run, don't walk away from lines from this over hyped waste of film. Rent it if you really want to watch it, but only on cheap rental night. Don't be suckered by the hype. I want my money and 2 hours back!",3,0,2,1 August 1999
The Matrix," The Best Sci-Fi Movie in Years!
","If you are a Sci-Fi movie fan desperately looking for something good to watch, or an action movie fan wanting artistic shooting scenes that would make John Woo proud or martial arts cut directly out of the best kung-fu movies, this is the movie for you. I never thought Keanu Reeves would find a role that suited him better than idiot Ted from Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure. I am impressed as hell. In summary, unless you hate great stories that make you think and kick ass action, see this movie! You won't be disappointed!",Null,0,0,26 October 1999
