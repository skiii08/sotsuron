United 93," So good -it adds suspense to a story everyone knows
","United 93 United 93 -Claustrophobic,effective suspense thriller- um but it is a true story- or as I like to call these things- faction-no big name stars- just the facts- actually a jumble of technobabble in the beginning as we watch air traffic controllers debate whether the planes are hijacked,etc.This is a well made flick- but it really adds nothing new to the story.The special features are respectful to the point of maudlin- I did enjoy this one more than Flight 93 - the made for TV movie on the same subject - United 93 was more focused on the people in the plane and the air-traffic controllers- Flight 93 had more weepy moments thrown in.

Lords of Dogtown," Good Supplement to the Documentary
","Lords of Dogtown - following the swell documentary Dogtown & The Z-Boys this flick follows 3 of the legendary sidewalk surfers from their early days as grommits keeping the pier locals only to the dogbowl sessions.The movie does a good job of capturing the exuberance of youth - the ability to create your own fun with limited resources- and like a typical 'rise and fall ' of rock star movie- we get treated to the rise and fall of the Zephyr team.A good vintage soundtrack(including 'Super Stupid' by Funkadelic) and tons of cameos from skaters flesh out an entertaining look @ skating years before it was part of the extreme sports thing. The DVD is chock full of extras including 2 different commentaries- including one by 2 of the original Z-Boys.Starring Emile Hirsch,Heath Ledger,Johnny Knoxville and others. B+",8,3,4,20 May 2007
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," no fighting in the ...
","Dr.Strangelove:Or How I learned How to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb -While Peter Sellers gets all the acclaim for his multiple roles- it is George C. Scott,Slim Pickens and Sterling Hayden that make this a lot of fun.Especially George C. Scott as General Buck Turgidson- he literally mauls the scenery in every scene and is funny while doing it.I fully admit the impact of this movie was lost on me- having heard many of it's best lines thru the years-but it was more entertaining than the dour Fail Safe -something I also watched this year.This dark comedy skewers the military and the whole concept of mutually assured destruction.I think my favorite Sellers character is the understated president who is cajoling the Russian leader on the phone.Worth a rental.

Blades of Glory," another mix of pratfalls and chesthair
","Blades of Glory - Will Ferrell and crew take on figure skating in this uneven comedy.Think Ricky Bobby on skates for the Ferrell character.Jon Heder is a skating wunderkind and the milquetoast rival for Ferrell's rebel persona.Their rivalry leads to a fight at an international competition and their lifetime ban from skating as singles.Of course the only loophole is for these 2 former rivals to become the first male/male figureskating team.The movie is helped along by swell supporting performances by Amy Poehler and Will Arnett as their rivals and Jenna Fischer(looking lovely) as the love interest of the main characters.The movie has enough chuckles to qualify as a comedy-but the formula of Will Ferrell as the egotisical sports figure is quickly loosing it's appeal.The DVD has deleted scenes,a gag reel and some interview segments from their press junket.Nothing special.

Nacho Libre," bring on the luchadores
",Nacho Libre - I enjoyed Jack Black as the obnoxious clerk in High Fidelity and the obsessed neo-con in Bob Roberts - I even own and have laughed @ the first Tenacious D album.I am burnt out on his schtick- School of Rock was like having my teeth pulled and his talk show appearances are the same note.Even so I am a life-long fan of the pro wrestling and love the luchadores.This broken Spanglish offering is about a loser priest that decides to take up wrestling in this offering from Nappy Dynamite director Jared Hess.I don't get it- it just doesn't work and it borders on belittling to the colorful history of Mexican wrestling.First off like the WCW sanctioned crapfest Ready to Rumble (which actually led to David Arquette holding the WCW strap for almost a month)- this movie treats wrestling as athletic competition and not staged entertainment.And once again wrestling fans are presented as either cross-eyed or not all that bright.This movie will appeal to pre-teen boys with it's mix of fart jokes and cartoon violence- the rest of the family can roll their eyes as little Billy guffaws with joy when Jack Black flexes his butt-cheeks for the comely nun.If you want to check out some good lucha action - netflix the Rey Misterio WWE DVD which features his great 1997 with the late Eddie Guerrero.The DVD has commentary by the star and the director- delted scenes and several featuretttes.

The Devil Wears Prada," something about Pravda
","Devil Wears Prada :Want to get ahead- figure you need to sacrifice your current ambitions by serving as an intern or taking less pay in your chosen field or tolerating a boss from hell.This movie is about one girl's challenging year as a personal assistant to a notorious Dragon Lady(Miranda Priestley as played by Meryl Streep).The movie is supposed to be a comedy- and it does provide some laughs- but also a ton of cringes and moments of deja vu- as you watch the main character (Anne Hathaway) continually subvert her own personality and values and social life to try and keep pace with the world of high fashion and her over-demanding underpaying boss.I have worked for several folks that have been described as bad bosses- and usually they are not so terrible- just demanding-but in the case of the main character in this flick - I would have loved to see her slip and fall(and not just on the gag reel)-Streep does a good job portraying such an unlovable and ambitious character- and she overwhelms the picture- so the whole coming of age story arc seems predictable and boring by the time it plays out for Anne Hathaway's character.The supporting actors do a good job filling their slots-Stanley Tucci as the high strung homosexual copy editor,Emily Blunt as the vicious,jealous and browbeaten size zero clacker,the African American female artist as the Wanda Sykes character,etc.The movie wants to be an homage to fashion- but it continually pokes fun at the absurd diets and meticulous habits of the denizens of Runway magazine.Not the over the top comedy I thought it would be- but a decent movie about finding how much you are willing to sacrifice to achieve your goals with a few chuckles thrown in.It is disturbing that a gal like Anne Hathaway is called fat or not skinny-even if it is in a movie about fashion.The DVD has a commentary track,deleted scenes and a gag reel.Worth a rental.

28 Weeks Later," Gore Cash-In
","28 Weeks Later -depressing sequel to the hopped up rage zombie flick 28 Days Later. Different director,different cast and not as interesting.Gone is the Omega Man /Quiet Earth feel of the first one.There are some exhilarating sequences in this puppy- but most of the movie feels like a snuff flick- we see just endless scenes of people being mowed down.Plotholesdo their best to strip this movie of any logic.Pretty much a waste of Robert Carlisle & Idiris Alba.I admit I really liked the first flick in this series directed by Danny Boyle- but this one just felt like a gore cash-in. The movie does have some good moments highlighted by a dramatic score- but not worth trekking out to the local cinema C-",4,4,8,20 May 2007
Disturbia," arresting house party
","disturbia-solid suburban thriller about a teen during house arrest who begins watching his neighbors.Shia Lebouf is engaging as the main character.Yes this is a modern remix of the Hitchcock classic Rear Window- not a note for note retelling- but a good update-not an improvement- but an entertaining movie that will work for the modern audience.Carrie Anne Moss and David Morse help add depth to this teen-centric world.Sadly some plot holes and leaps of ill-logic make this ultimately a disposable entertainment that will goose the audience into watching once but may not engage them enough to want to re-watch it.Worth a rental.The DVD has out-takes,a featurette,deleted scenes and a cast and director commentary.I think this is the first commentary I have heard that had 3 cellphone calls on the track- the director's wife,agent and one of the co-stars call in.The commentary track for this PG-13 movie is filled with profanity by Shia Lebouf-who is joined on the track by the director D.J. Caruso and female co-star Sarah Roemer who seem to be enjoying themselves- even though it got old real quick when the director kept pointing out over and over where each scene was shot and how a yard scene from Pasadena was cut with a soundstage shot several times.The movie itself is better than most of the modern Hollywood suspense flicks-carried by the leading man and ready made to sell some DVDs and get rented for folks looking for the latest suspenseful flick.Worth a rental.

Cross of Iron," Forgotten War Classic
",Cross of Iron : Cross of Iron : Excellent Sam Peckinpah flick about a German unit during WW2.Filmed in 1977 this movie follows Sgt.Stiener(James Coburn) and his unit as they fight on the treacherous Eastern Front.Steiner is an excellent soldier who is fighting for his country and not the Nazi party- but he is unconventional and always butting heads with the officers.This movie is a story about the absurdity of war and the insanity of tradition during the bloodiest of conflicts.Coburn's unit is put under the command of an officer obsessed with getting the Iron Cross - no matter how he gets it.Featuring an excellent cast(including David Warner & James Mason) and chaotic battle footage and tons of quotable lines - this is a movie that should be scene by everyone that thinks that war is the answer for anything.The hospital sequence in the center of the film is one of the most disturbing and interesting things I have seen this year and this is the best combat flick I have seen since the reconstructed Big Red One.

Grindhouse," 2 movies one fun afternoon
","Grindhouse Grindhouse - a love letter to junk cinema of the 70s and the whole viewing experience-I admit I love the B-movies of the 70s- not all of them- but stuff like Detroit 9000, The Bad Bunch,Death Race 2000.The 3 hours rushed by for me- I enjoyed the faux trailers- the vintage ads.I enjoyed Planet Terror for it's over the top zombie freakfest and it's odd ending-Rose McGowan looked tremendous with 2 legs and just as well with a machinegun leg.Death Proof played like a mix of tease porn with the sexy gals and the ass-kicking.Kurt Russell hammed it up nice as Stuntman Mike and the final car chase was a nice eye-popping good time with Zoe Bell as herself.Sure this is a collage of movie styles(like most of QTs flicks-I don't mind) and as always I loved the soundtrack for Death Proof- am listening to it now.A fun afternoon.

Enemy at the Gates," Shootout @ the crumbling corral
","Enemy @ The Gates-the pivotal battle of WW2 European theater- brutal,gruesome,thousands dead- and Hollywoood managed to sammich in a love story-wtf? Jude Law is a sniper who learned his craft hunting wolves on the frozen tundra- he is a foot solidier dropped into the insanity of Stalingrad- he manages to survive the initial battle and is left for dead- he meets a political officer(Joe Fiennes) for the USSR- he is seen killing off several Nazis- and turned into a propaganda hero.He does so well the Nazis bring in Ed Harris to have a shootout in the middle of this siege.Also Joey Fiennes & Jude Law both fall for Rachel Wiesz- OK I know Hollywood did not need to remake Stalingrad (which was brutal sad and hard to watch) - but a love story in Stalingrad-yeesh C+",6,0,1,27 May 2007
War of the Worlds," Solid,Scary Suspenseful Remake only hampered by Fanning
","War of The Worlds -This new version does a great job of conveying the menace of the aliens.It was neat to watch an invasion story from the ground- no war rooms,no cutaways to news coverage- just a man and his family adjusting to an ever-changing reality.I admit I am not bothered by Tom Cruise the way others are- but I am not impressed at all by Dakota Fanning- maybe it was the spoiled brat who was always screaming at the worst times in this movie- but nothing I have seen her in that seems all that special.I enjoyed this movie - it had several surprising reveals - some of them up there with the door opening in the Wizard of Oz.This is a special effects movie and they are boffo- but it is also a suspense thriller- you never know when the aliens will make an appearance and what they will do - nor can you predict what other panicked humans will do or how they will react.

Rear Window," Still a fave after 4 viewings
","Rear Window - I was lucky enough to see this on the big screen in the 90s.The DVD is a great transfer of one of Hitchcock's most suspenseful,funny and interesting flicks.Jimmy Stewart is an adventurous photographer spending downtime in a legcast after an on the job mishap.He spends his time watching his neighbors while under the care of an insurance nurse(the always engaging Thelma Ritter) and his girlfriend(Grace Kelly looking absolutely lovely-including a breathtaking and perfect entrance).Stewart is a voyuer -watching the wannabe ballerina traipse around in her bikini or less,watching the newlyweds,the salesman and his wife quarrel,Miss Lonelyhearts,a couple that sleeps under the stars- we drink in his entertainment-a full feast complimented by excellent sound design and a visual wit that too many suspense films leave on the cutting room floor.This movie is based on a Cornell Woolrich short story and mixes elements of a true crime from the UK with a romance.The DVD has a 50 minute documentary on the making of the movie and the casting.The Jimmy Stewart character feels like a third take on his George Bailey persona-or a mix of George Bailey and Macauly Connor-as his arguments with Lisa Freemont reel like cynical remixes of some of his arguments with Tracey Lords(Katherine Hepburn) in Philadelphia Story.A must own for fans of suspense and great story-telling.
