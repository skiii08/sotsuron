",We all know Pres. Kennedy's murder mystery. Time has settled lot of dust on the real image. Kevin Costner with this role convince us of the absurdity of manic bullet theory which we all heard but are not willing to accept as there are a lot of lacunae.

Joker," It's for reviewers not for masses classes either
","With some real good facial muscle exercises and some new condition display ...when disappointed starts un controllable laughs ... The screenplay, story illogical gun firing murders leave us clueless ! We have seen heroics of Joker in Batman and By Raj in an Indi Cinema but here one fails to laugh.

The Greatest Showman," Poetic saga of a Show-man's Life screened, danced, acted and entertained.
","American Show-man's saga is well sung, well acted, and very well danced and choreographed. Lyrics excellent, lot of one liners and poetry. Still the tough American going with compete on Artists deformities turned unique qualities and blamed as Circus by the critics.. as the time went by all put together on stage one artist locality identified with unique public response.... It does have family tangles, a Father , an extra ordinary visionary of a public taste, backlashes from strong Opera- Concerts- Belau conservatives backlash and all. An artist is an artist above all. No one is superior no one inferior. Its a Family. The unique guys were rejected and were laughed at by the same society... when their talents were identified drawbacks in real life is a part of life and the most polite humble acceptance by the creative artists team will win hearts. Film for all. People have rated this very high I re-command even higher.
After seeing this film I also studied the efforts people took to garland the story of this gentleman . THEY HAVE RE-SEARCHED STUDIED ABOUT 50 BOOKS AND THEN CREATED THIS MARVEL ..",10,1,2,31 August 2019

So is the Tunnel digging. One man is developing low vision still gets in team of escape team all the ingredients of melodrama cinematic ally and entertainment wise very nicely knitted. All characters are leaving a long lasting impressions. One is given a full Jail site, Fun, Danger, Wit, Skills, Tunnel digging, a little mistake and ruthless authority all is accommodated well.

Teenagers fantasy could have gone for a worst scenario but suddenly main plot is totally different. A shy but same sweater wearing girl good singer enters the scene Reverent's daughter full of INTRINSIC Qualities. In her company the jumping jack kind of naughty teenager learns lessons of life. Asking permission of girls father to go out for dinner discipline to start with the journey though nothing new but adorable through out till the end.

Here the team has those punch lines, good acting and nice background story of Media. They fully exploited the plot.",8,1,1,6 September 2019
Braveheart," Scottish Freedom story with Fiction like treat
","It is not a Document-rial so depending upon good photography costumes and horses fight scenes old war scenes are praise worthy. One sympathizes with the team as the story itself is dependent upon fairy folk elements. Some real British shrewdness is knitted in film.'No Archers to begin the fight ! They cost us! Use the Irish in stead' A command by the British King says it all. They did have some 2 versions one reserved for British-Audience is the proof that biting remarks are trimmed.
British daughter in law falling in fantasy love and managing love story with the main Scottish Mel Gibson acted role was cutely demonstrated. War tech of waiting for an enemy advance, surprise elements of old weapons of LONGER SPEARS, Betrayal by established self centered allies, last minute support withdrawal, Not begging for mercy nor opting for a faster death penalty but only cry for FREEDOM in spite of tortured death highlights the heroism. Its OK film. Surprised to see it is overall hyped too much.",6,1,2,9 October 2019
Joy," QVC film in Woman Empowerment perspectives
",JL does a woman enter pioneers role. She has her own ideas of making a new MOP ! Its thread thick innovative idea is really good for mopping. Quality Value and Convenience are 3 marketing principles. New Product BOOM Big investment and withdrawal and betraying partners rivals.... Every thing nicely knitted. How a commercial exploitation is made in talk shows greatly shown. JL does not wear the attractive dress but is comfortable in handling the anchor hard earned spot by Brad C. Rob Nero has little to contribute. But JL does it all fine. Gradually she knows the business and practices very ethically strongly against all Odds one can anticipate. Her female role actually helps her to win the modesty and sympathy from Audience. Little marketing strategy textbook like but gracefully without fun and too much of it ruthlessness displayed much better. A simple MOP made from threads middle sizes can be more aggressively made a topic of town product and may give a good run in business. On this line lot of hardships are also knitted. Un-expected swings of mood in public FMCG Fast moving consumer good psychology very nicely portrayed. Everybody performed modestly and matched the story elements with expected melodrama treats.,9,1,1,12 November 2019
