Conquest 1453," The conflict of rightness and badness
","I watched this movie without reading any reference (except the trailer), so I think I can write my honest opinion. If you want to watch it, please bear it in your mind that this movie is the historical basis event that is fictionalize as for entertainment, then you won't get any disappointment. However, if you want to see this movie and expecting the historical summary to be well-presented in there, please consider not to expect too much and be ready for some contradictions to what we learned in the historical lessons in school.I didn't watch any Turkish movie before this. But I think they spend good effort and a relevant budget for its making, and for the result it is a presentable entertainment, meaning: you can enjoy this movie with relax with the pop-corn in your hands and enjoy some heroic actions.For the historical point of view itself, it is a bit too one-sided story although some dialogue of Constantinople and Rome was presented, it missed or maybe made up some important details, and I will not say much of those. It seems the director wanted to build the modern historical image of the Ottoman empire from their point of view, and they made it. As entertainment I score it as 8, and as historical background is 4, the producers, directors & actors did their best in overall which deserve a 7. So the average score I can give is 6.3, rounded up to 6.",6,1,3,23 November 2014
