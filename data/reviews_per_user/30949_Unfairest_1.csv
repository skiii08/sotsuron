The Avengers," Avengers Assemble
","Epic, It's a must watch because I had been waiting for this movie for a long time and now that i saw it, it was worth the wait. Everything was perfect, the actors did an incredible job, the them was phenomenal, my siblings enjoyed it (but i think i enjoyed it even more)I suggest that you stay after the credits, there is something more that hints the next Avengers movie and some people might like it, some people wont like it at all. I have been reading comics since i was young and never in my early years would i ever imagine a movie so epic that would make me think back to those times i read the comics. I gave it a 10/10 because it deserves it and you can tell that they put hard work and dedication into it.",10,2,6,6 May 2012
