Walk the Line," Do not forget to 'GET THE RHYTHM', when you get an opportunity to watch this masterpiece
","I always have some problems with Oscar nominated films. It's hard for me to explain the reason for this. Maybe, it's my rebellious nature, maybe, it's just a coincidence. Who knows. But thanks God 'Walk the Line' is not the case.'Walk the Line' is a biographical drama about a country music legend, Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix), and the love of his life, June Carter (Reese Witherspoon). In a few words, film tells us about Johnny's life from the very beginning to the very climax of both, his career and his personal life. I wonder if there is such a thing as spoiler when it comes to biographical films as you either know the life story of the person and just want to watch it come alive, or you don't know the biography, but you might look it up before watching. I've decided not to put a spoiler warning, so, if you are still reading this review - BE AWARE, there are spoliers further.I was just petrified by Joaquin Phoenix oustanding performance in this film. I suppose he did a really good job by trying to live up to Johnny Cash's expections who himself chose Joaquin Phoenix to potray him. Joaquin Phoenix's voice is beyond imagination. I will be honest with you, it's pretty hard to listen to real Johnny right now, as I am still too much into Phoenix's mellow voice.Reese Witherspoon is just great. I have nothing more to say. I like her since the times of 'Legally Blonde', I enjoy her even more after this film. Oscar for Best Actress is definitely justified by what she does on the screen. Just in love with her.Music. I am a huge-huge fan of everything connected with music. It was just a paradise for my ears. The lyrics speaks to your heart. It's pretty simple, but it's so real and that's the reason why it is so unforgettable. 'Or... would you sing somethin' different. Somethin' real. Somethin' *you* felt. Cause I'm telling you right now, that's the kind of song people want to hear. That's the kind of song that truly saves people. It ain't got nothin to do with believin' in God, Mr. Cash. It has to do with believin' in yourself.'After wathcing, I had one issue that tortured me all night long. I can't decide how I feel about Johnny Cash's personality. It has nothing to do with drugs. Drugs are only a side effect of success in this case. Practically, none of the greatest musicians of that time(and the contemporary ones as well) escaped becoming addicts at that or this point. I do not approve of his actions, but this is something I can explain. But the idea that still drives me crazy is the fact that Johnny Cash never grew up. Till the end of his life he remained a 12-year old boy, who went fishing, just because he wanted and made a fatal mistake as he lost his brother the same day. I guess, he stopped growing up at this very moment. He couldn't believe it happened, so, it was easier for his mind to stay where it was and give up evolving. When Johnny goes to the army, we can see him taking the same road he once took with his borther. He walks jumping, obviously, remebering the day when everything was good, and no one knew what could go wrong. Or when Johnny tells June that he has no idea how to use a fishing rod. Or when he giggles like a little girl after the first encounter with June. Everything would be just fine. He is a man who is a bit childish, so, what's wrong with him? I'll tell what. I have dubious feeling about the way Johnny Cash treated June Carter. It was obvious that at the very beginning she was not ready to love someone again. But Johnny did whatever it takes to earn her love. It seems like he is just a spoiled boy who wants to get a toy so badly. But June is not a toy, she is a human being. I suppose he was a bit too pushy from the start. If he had behaved a bit differently, he mightn't have spent so many years trying to make June his. By the end of the film, you get impressed by the way he is still struggling for her. At the very end, you understand the essence of their behaviours. He was doing his best to make her love him, she was running away from love as she was terrified to 'burn'.One person was ready to love the other one without even thinking. While this other one was too much afraid to have feeling towards someone. Finally, both of them surrendered. Isn't it an example of true love? I think it is.",10,0,0,4 March 2018
