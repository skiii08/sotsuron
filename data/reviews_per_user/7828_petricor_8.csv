Blade Runner 2049," How Blade Runner 2049 got sidetracked into being all about AI.
","Blade Runner was about what it was like to be human told from a very human perspective because replicants were biological. The sequel feels more like what does it take for artificial intelligence to be human and if it feels vaguely familiar it's because it is. That theme has been overdone, most notably and recently in movies like Ex Machina and Her, which do the theme more justice. There's a real lack of connectivity with the film because they're trying to shove AI and electronics and the original theme is lost in translation. It's an updated, commercialized Blade Runner for the masses in 2017.I found the scenes with the AI woman frustrating. How convenient to remove a real human from the equation and settle for something unreal and try to make it real to validate your experiences. The replicant idea was thrown away, pushed away to the side to pave the way for this AI theme. I found it a troubling commentary on our modern era of technology and left feeling perplexed and disturbed.Also, to lightly touch upon other subjects because I don't have the heart to expand: A clever twist doesn't make a clever plot or mystery. You still got plot holes and questions left at the end. Not satisfying at all.The music isn't nearly as evocative as the original movie's was and the only time I connected with it was when it was literally using the original movie's notes. Not sure what is with Hans Zimmer this year between this and Dunkirk.The ambiance of the original is gone. You don't create tension and intrigue by automatically extending each scene.You can forget about having a scene like Tears in Rain. The dialogue was literally cringe-worthy in more places than it should have been.Overall, save your money. Watch the trailer. Watch the short clips, they evoke more emotion. Better yet, re-watch the original. Forget the sequel ever happened.",5,21,48,5 October 2017
Interstellar," A movie like this only comes around every so often.
","So you've come here to read what all the hype is about? Wonderful! I won't go into too much detail about the actual film, because this one's enjoyed best if you don't spoil things for yourself. Seriously, don't do that.Let me preface this by saying I watched Interstellar twice in the movie theatre last November (and a few times since then). It's just that good of a journey.First off, I want to address this, 'So, how complicated is this movie? Do I need to know a lot about astrophysics?' Well, that depends. I went with a couple of friends and none of them are interested in black holes, wormholes, space travel AT ALL. Some were confused throughout the movie, some weren't. I think it depends on how well you personally pay attention. This is not a movie for you to munch your popcorn throughout the dialogue scenes, because you WILL miss important things, especially with the much talked about sound editing (the music overpowers dialogue at times -- this has been explained as being intentional for showing the character's emotional reactions instead, take of that what you will). It doesn't hurt to brush up on concepts like general relativity, wormholes, and black holes, but it's really unnecessary. A lay-person will get this movie if they pay attention. After all, Christopher Nolan is known for cerebral films for a reason. If you need a comparison, Inception is way more convoluted than Interstellar is. I'm not even exaggerating. Interstellar just deals with trickier physics concepts, but it's actually straight-forward.So what is Interstellar? Interstellar is family drama dressed up in space sci-fi clothes. The key here is the fiction part of sci-FI. If people can suspend their disbelief when watching the latest X-Men movie, they can suspend their disbelief watching Interstellar. This movie doesn't deserve the flack it gets for being 'unreal.' It takes physics knowledge (which are mostly theories to this day anyway) and uses it in a realistic manner. If you need 100% truth, you should not be watching sci-fi films. There are documentaries and actual textbooks for that sort of stuff! The more important question is is Interstellar logical? By far, its plot is grounded and knows what it is.Everything here is top-notch. The acting. The plot. The cinematography. The music.Both times at the cinema, I was surrounded by a mostly male audience. Let me tell you what happened both times when the credits began to roll. Silence. Utter silence as people just sat there either brushing the tears from their eyes or holding them back. Yes, I saw grown men getting emotional, and no, it's not wrong. In fact, it was really great to see how it wasn't just me clearly affected by Interstellar.I'm not a parent. I don't even want kids in the future, yet the family drama deeply moved me in a way I didn't think possible. I don't cry during movies. When a movie's over, I can reflect on how much I enjoyed the ride, but I don't really contemplate on any matters. That wasn't the case with Interstellar.Interstellar's message was highly ambitious. It wanted to tell us something about not only ourselves as individuals, but ourselves, as a species. I don't want to spoil anything more, so I won't, but suffice to say, I can't believe simple tripe (in both actual plot and scope of its message) like Gravity can get so much praise or how a movie like American Sniper can get nominated for Best Picture when Interstellar had so much more to offer to all of us as human beings. I know I sound rather grandiose right now. Maybe some will call it pretentious. I don't care. Interstellar took itself dead seriously and more importantly it earnestly sought to tell each moviegoer its message. I don't know about you, but when we're constantly bombarded by crappy, brain-dead movies, I think that's very honorable. We should all thank Christopher Nolan for being amongst the directors who actually still care about making aesthetic films which make us think a little harder. There's not many of them still left in town.tl;dr - Interstellar is a treasure. A movie with both heart and science. Christopher Nolan's emotional tour de force. Simply, a must-watch for anyone.",10,4,8,16 April 2015
Dunkirk," The struggle to write a positive review is real.
","It's hard to rate and review a movie like Dunkirk. To start off, I knew what I was going into, and yes, the film lacks character development, plot, and dialogue. I know this. I understand Nolan's reasons behind this. After all, I've seen every one of his movies and most at least once and I admire their direction greatly. So I get Dunkirk is supposed to be an intense survival action movie. You don't really need any of those aforementioned elements in a film but you better hope you have done enough of a good job on the other elements holding a film together. So instead of reviewing what we don't really have because that would be unfair, I'm going to review the things we're still given. Also divided into a triptych, because I, too, can be clever. '1. The Cinematography: 1 hr 46 min 2. The Sound: 1 hr 46 min 3. The Theme: Last hr (as you are struggling to pay attention)'The Cinematography : Lacking. The camera darted from frame to frame and scene to scene like it was the one shell-shocked. It's not that it was like one of those action movies with shaky camera where you have no idea who is fighting who and what is going on. It wasn't that bad. What I mean is it lacked gravitas. It stayed on each scene long enough for us to understand what was going on but it all seemed devoid of momentum which was strange given it was a survival film. For example, there are air scenes which are just long enough to see the sky and sea tilt on their sides, with gorgeous shades of blue, and then boop - cut to new scene. There is no gravitas because there's no time for it to happen. All the beauty of those particular scenes and other scenes gone and wasted because nevermind -- they needed to fit more disjointed scenes and give us a feel of 'air, sea, land.' Okay, fair enough, but let me enough the nice cinematography instead of butchering it up. The Sound : Hans Zimmer is amazing, he basically made Interstellar the bombastic epic sci-fi it was, but the sound in Dunkirk just didn't do it for me. No melody. No distinctness. Boring. I'm not stupid regarding what they tried to achieve here - put a ticking clock in the backdrop and instantly amp up the suspense. It's kind of clich√©d and feels cheap. Other people probably think it's a clever use. To me, it's more like film making 101. Boring and kind of insulting. The only thing it did for me was prevent me from going to sleep so at least it served some sort of purpose. The Theme : I've seen a lot of reviews give Dunkirk flack for lack of character development and a lack of emotions however there are emotions to be experienced in this movie, but I'm not sure if they're anything but grim. The irony of Brexit negotiations going on right now and the rare episodes of emotion in the movie have not been lost on me. Suffice it to say, Dunkirk shows the dark side of human survival. At the end, I didn't really feel like the enemy of the film were the Nazis. The true enemy was people turning on one another. I don't want to give away any spoilers so this is perhaps too cryptic. In a struggle for survival, how do we not lose our humanity? And what if we do? Those are the big questions Dunkirk asks.In conclusion, while I seemed to have gotten a lot of the intellectual decisions behind the production of Dunkirk, I still cannot applaud its execution. It fell flat. The only semblance of movie magic I am accustomed to from Nolan I got at the end with one of the British RAF airplanes. A rare moment of all three cinematography, sound, and theme combining into something poignant, moving, poetic. But just like that.. it was gone. Marred by the next scene which defied all semblance of events and time and ruined my moment of movie magic.I am absolutely flabbergasted by Christopher Nolan. I am not sure why everyone's saying this is his best film to date. It pales in comparison to his other movies. It pales in comparison to other war films. Is it because it's the most accessible genre of the movies he has done? The least cerebral? Cue all the typical Oscar nominations and fanfare but Dunkirk can't and won't fool me. Nolan, here's hoping your next movie is not a big gigantic mess like Dunkirk is. 4/10, 1 for each element above and another for that one particular RAF airplane",4,17,32,22 July 2017
La La Land," So are you a romantic or cynic?
","I was very much looking forward to La La Land, being a fan of old Hollywood musicals the likes of Fred and Ginger, etc. It was disappointing, because it seemed like watching two different movies - the whimsical romantic comedy musical and the realistic gut-wrenching drama.The beginning sets you up feeling like you're on cloud nine and you might even forget neither of the two actors can really sing or be remotely comparable to old musicals in terms of dancing ability. And really, it's okay. We don't need a technically amazing singing and dancing pair of actors, because that's not what Hollywood is like today. The feel of the bygone musical era was there in La La Land and it was enough to make you feel good about life....and then the feeling is snatched from you in the second half and you wonder what the heck happened. It's not even 'reality,' it's pure old cynicism, and in any other movie, this would have been tolerated, but a movie which set its mind up to be a delightful jazz tapping number, it's nothing short of a betrayal.For a movie talking of pipe dreams, when does a dream become so fixed you're unwilling to compromise or look past it to make your life more enjoyable? While some people find there's nothing wrong with staying constant and going after what you want, some people understand life's a little more dynamic and staying true to an original dream can be equally toxic. It's called adaptation. I'm not sure Chazelle was trying to be ironic or not with La La Land. Therefore, I can't seriously recommend this as best picture or inspiring, but I have to admit, at least it presented jazz in a good light, so yay? To add, acting is great. Music has a few haunting, dreamy, and often melancholic hooks to keep you humming along. Dancing is decent for today's Hollywood. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone did a superb job, especially Gosling. He stole the show with his piano-playing performance and deserves whatever accolades he receives. It's just, to my dismay and horror, the story falls flat on its face and easily ruins the movie from becoming any greater.In summary, this is the ultimate movie to test whether you're a romantic or a cynic. Turns out I'm not as much of the latter as I thought I was and therein lies the problem of being able to fully enjoy La La Land. A big pity. 6/10",6,5,11,15 January 2017
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Transformers: An Exercise in Running
","If you like to see things get destroyed, boy, is Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen a real treat for you! If you like flashy special effects, you will love this. Transformers is so busy showing you just how cool robots waging war on each other can be, it forgot to actually make sense. When Sam's parents show up in the desert, I felt like I got a little taste of the brownie Mrs. Wintwicky sampled at college, which took more than its fair share of screen time. I came here to watch robots, not 18 year olds getting overly excited about campus life. Though in the movie's defense, it did have the movie's greatest pay-off, so just bear with its seeming idiocy.The whole movie felt like an elaborate, destructive dream sequence. Good if you literally have nothing else to do. Bad if you want your brain to function. Here's how to check if your logic skills haven't been blown to pieces... what is strange about Mikaela when she's doing all that running in the desert? Hint: All that dust. All that dirt. All those explosions. Mikaela (or rather her wardrobe) gets an A+ for consistently clean white jeans. I'm so jealous. Someone better let the rest of the cast in on the secret, because they're running around in less than pristine condition. (I felt especially bad for Mrs. Wintwicky, which brings me to yet another question... What is she doing in the desert? Huh? Did I miss something?) So great apparently is the magic of Megan Fox. Or maybe screaming Leo just didn't deserve to look clean. That's what you get for panicking during the entire movie, Leo. Speaking of running, who knew having alien robots that can transform into cars required so much legwork? Maybe Michael Bay's casting choices were based on a single question, 'Can you run? Show me how you run.' When they aren't running, they're hiding. All the while, if you haven't shut your brain off, you will be asking the pivotal question, why? Rest assured, because you do not need answers for in the end, the power of leadership, courage, destiny, and all that wishy-washy feel good stuff trump everything else, including death. If you end the movie eye-rolling, congratulations. They are a sign of your brain trying to reboot itself from the nightmare. It's a good sign. It's okay. You survived.",4,0,3,13 April 2015
Arrival," The deliciously dark meaning of Arrival's nonsensical plot
","The delicious irony of Arrival is if the alien squids came to help the humans develop so that they could help the aliens out in 3000 years then Amy Adams's Louise is doing it wrong because she KNEW the future but didn't want to change a thing about it despite gaining clairvoyance. So, I'm sorry to inform the alien squids, but y'all are mega screwed. Once I got this deliciously dark ending, I came to enjoy Arrival better than the boring slugfest this was and why I didn't flat-out give it 1/10. It's a good metaphor for how we are living today. For example, we know about climate change and how our future is heading but we don't really care about it to change our course in any meaningful way. It reminded me a little of Hugh Laurie's speech in Tomorrowland. Otherwise looking at Arrival, the actual meat of the story was delivered in the last five minutes. What a waste. Even the actual conflict between Louise and her future husband was off-screen. At the end, we're supposed to be comforted at his words about how he fell in love with her when we know they're empty words. Shortly before, she was telling him her husband leaves her and as a top-notch physicist he should have figured out she had no husband, not then and there of course as he wouldn't have known at the time, but later by putting two and two together. If he can figure out heptapod lingo, he sure as heck can figure out English. Boy, I'm not letting that fly. We don't see any of the pair's future marital woes over the loss of a child directly. THAT would have made for insightful drama. Except the drama ended just as soon as it really began. Sort of like the movie ended the way it began. It's not 'smart', it's just hollow. The only way it could end that way is if there is an emotional payoff and I couldn't have that in the last five minutes I remotely began to feel anything during the movie. So instead we got a nonsensical plot which ended up with a 8/10 imdb rating. Next time please cut out the aliens, I mean middlemen, and skip to the real drama of the movie. You CAN cut a movie non-linearly without relying on sci-fi tropes. If Memento did it, so can you, Arrival.Anyway, it's a pity Arrival had a nonsensical plot.. I guess to fit a nonsensical world. Bravo.",3,2,4,27 December 2017
Fifty Shades of Grey," Fifty Shades of Utterly Bored
","Let me start off by clarifying that I watched 50 Shades not with the sole intent of bashing nor adoring it. I knew what kind of book it and its series was. I went in for the cinematic experience and to feed my curiosity: can a garbage book produce a good movie? The answer to that question is no. My biggest problem was the pacing. Nothing substantial happened for the longest time (this is what happens when you have a meek person - no confrontation, no substantial drama for the LONGEST time). I kept waiting for any climax, plot-wise, mind you, and it did occur! Right at the very end, but at that point, I didn't really care one iota for either Ana or Christian. I was too busy nodding off. People who went into this for a lovey-dovey Valentine's Day 2015 had another thing coming. What would have normally constituted the MIDDLE or TWO-THIRDS of a romance movie, constituted the end. Why? Because the execs like their sequels and so does 50 Shades' author, E. L. James. It's all about milking that cash cow.Ideally, this would all end here, so the message it could get across is one that condemns, rather than condones, stalking and abusive behavior. Unfortunately, 50 Shades spent far too many minutes building up an idolizing portrait of Mr. Grey and his fancy schmancy lifestyle for it to have come across as that. It can't even be passed off as effective satire.As for the acting, Jamie as Christian was wooden. The guy was likely working on perfecting the American accent (which, sorry, did not happen) or feeling foolish without his beard. In his defense, he has the creepy vibe down-pat, probably from playing a serial killer in The Fall. The same can't be said of Dakota. Her Ana was just as I imagined her to be. It takes skill to play so daft a character.If you're looking for racy content, you're better off watching TV series like Game of Thrones, Outlander, or dare I say, Sex and the City. The movie takes so long to address Mr. Grey's kinky side, you'll have forgotten the real reason you're tuning into 50 Shades in the first place.2/10 because the dialogue could have been more cringe-worthy (no inner goddess, subconscious telling me all the things, not even a mention of fifty shades!), Dakota at least tried, and the music saved me from complete slumber. So yes, it could have actually been worse. Instead, it was just a really bad movie, regardless of the source material. 50 Shades does not stand on its own feet as a movie. Whether that's a good or bad thing is another question entirely.",2,4,9,13 April 2015
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Kingsman: What a disservice.
","I'm a little concerned. To say the least, I am concerned.Kingsman delights in portraying itself as an over the top parody of James Bond movies. Well, that's the cop-out answer anyway, because it keeps telling us it's different. 'It's not that kind of movie.' Well, is it supposed to be a better kind of action movie then? Let's take a look at the irony: It's not okay to kill dogs, but people who you deem as ignorant and evil? Totally okay. Dogs are after all innocent, fluffy creatures. People are clearly not. That's why the famous church scene plays out like a music video to a rock song. Heck yes to mass murder as long as those people don't agree with you or your vision of what is right and wrong. Sound familiar? Crack open any history book and figure it out if it's not evident yet.Repeated twists and turns. Classic 'waiting until the last second for things to work out' that is typical of each action movie. Talk about hilariously ironic, but wait. It gets worse.A gentleman has manners, Colin Firth? You don't say! Dressing a wolf in sheep's clothes doesn't change who he is. By he, I mean Eggsy. Cursing every other sentence and only thinking about collecting his 'reward' at the end is apparently what new generations of gentlemen do.So, what was his award you might ask? Ever played Super Mario Brothers? What's the point of playing to the end of the dungeons? The princess, of course! Women are a complete mess in this film: from the mother who gets abused to the Swedish princess who refuses to go along with the villain offering herself on a platter to the hero to the only woman Kingsman on screen who is instrumental to the hero's success (ahem: correction, GIRL, because men can be referred to as gentlemen repeatedly, but what does she get called? 'Good girl!' And I know you know the term lady because you mention it earlier, Eggsy. Don't play daft.). Oh, but lighten up! It was only a comedy! I'm sorry if I want women to not play silly damsels in distress. I'm sorry if I want consistent character development for women. I'm sorry if I want anything BETTER for my gender. I should know by now I shouldn't expect anything better from Hollywood, but I sure as hell don't have to take it standing down.At the end of the movie, I feel like Valentine had proved his point about human beings. If that isn't scary, I don't know what is.Parody? Satire? Hardly. It's the same old Hollywood wolf dressed up in sheep's clothes. For shame. For shame.",4,4,10,9 May 2015
