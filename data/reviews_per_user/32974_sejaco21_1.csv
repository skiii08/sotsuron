Requiem for a Dream," The most powerful movie ever
","After I watched requiem for a dream I immediatley thought it was the most powerful movie i have ever seen.  Before viewing it I didn't think it could get much worse then American history X, but Requiem takes it to a whole other level.  Not only was it the most moving movie ever, but also one of the best.  After the credits rolled i sat on my couch for an hour contemplating the movie.  the next day i went to amazon and ordered the unrated version.  Since then i haven't gone a day without thinking about it. I would reccomend this to everyone not because it's a happy movie, but because you have to see it.  I don't know about showing it in school, it's a lot to handle especially unrated, but what a great message it has.  I don't know who wouldn't think twice before injecting heroin in there arm after watching this.  A great story with some of the best acting I've ever seen. Not only was the acting great, but the directing stood out especially when they take the drugs.  The music at the end also is very moving and powerful. I would give this movie a ten out of ten and i reccomend it for everyone, you should watch it with an open mind and see it for what it was worth.",10,0,0,25 March 2003
