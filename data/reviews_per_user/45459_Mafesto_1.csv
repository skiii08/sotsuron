The Avengers," This. Is. Entertainment!
","If you were into comic-books/manga as a kid or, like me, still are: You remember that feel you got/get when your favorite character does something, just, incredibly awesome, like knocking the villains block off?That feeling is what this movie is built upon. Seeing your favorite heroes just doing awesome stuff upon awesome stuff, over and over again. The acting's great, the effects and feel you get when watching the movie in a theater is close to unmatched.This movie does just about every kick-ass thing, and more. However: this movie is no Watchmen and no Dark Knight, it doesn't establish a dark feeling and it's far from deep storytelling and character-development. It is all about capturing our inner 12-year old fanheart and bringing them to light for a while.Watch it, enjoy it.",10,3,8,5 May 2012
