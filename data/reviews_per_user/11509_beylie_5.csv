It," Unfortunately not that good
","Disclaimer - this is my favorite book of all time.The first 10 minutes was beautiful and I had my hopes up. The amount of details included from the book were very good. Then suddenly the movie turned into disjointed scenes with a bunch of scare jumps that are really not that scary unless your perhaps 10. The deviation from the book is ridiculous, almost worse than the original mini series. I think the kids did a great job and Bill Skarsg√•rd shined when they didn't ruin his character with CGI, but unfortunately this movie left me disappointed. I think people who have not read the book might enjoy it, but they'll never get the true dread, hopelessness and fear that the book instills by watching this. I'm going to recommend the book instead of this attempt.",2,34,69,9 September 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Better than I thought
","I didn't have any expectations for this. I thought it was well handled, even some of the controversial characters (I think one character specifically is going to split the SW community in two). The action sequences were great! Ground combat, space combat, melee, all done beautifully. I actually felt tired at the end of the movie because of the amount of things that were going on. Unfortunately the movie is too short for us to get to know the back stories of some of the more interesting characters. I'd recommend this too any SW fan. It's great to see a movie dedicated to the people that made helped the rebels take on the empire.I think I might even like this more than SW VII. Either way, you're bound to enjoy it. It's a great chapter in the SW universe.",8,249,458,14 December 2016
Jurassic World," Shouldn't have expected more
","Well, the only thing this movie had going for it was the throwbacks to the original. Character dialogue is weak, too few tense scenes, too much cgi. The characters also jarringly change their outlook on life halfway through the film. Chris Pratt wasn't too bad. The army guy was okay too. This movie feels incredibly rushed. I felt none of the awe the original inspired. The only thing that got my blood pumping was the few times they used the music from the original.Slightly entertaining if you're bored. If you're a fan of JP 1 & 2, I think you might be disappointed. I won't be watching this again.",4,0,3,12 July 2015
Joker," Incredible performance and awesome screenplay and music
","I went in not knowing what to expect. The movie is incredibly well made. From the way the almost ambient soundtrack pulsates through the whole movie, to Joaquin's breathtaking performance to the awesome cinematography and the mesmerizing ending, this simply rocks. If there's more, please let me know. This was an excellent movie in a sea of drab.",9,2,3,8 November 2019
It Chapter Two," Better than the first, still not good enough.
","I thought very little of the first movie. It deviated from the book after the very first scene. This review isn't about that movie though. I gave this 4 stars as I thought first half of the movie worked really well and kind of stayed true to the book. All the cast members were excellent except whoever the actor is that plays Eddie. He has the emotional range of brick. Bill Hader did an excellent job! Awesome cameo as well by a certain person.The movie starts going south when it's Ben's turn for his solo journey. From there the book is pretty much ignored and it starts falling to pieces. I don't want to even get into the ending of the movie. The ending is so poorly adapted that I thought I might walk out of the theatre.Still. It got a whole 3 stars more from me than the first solely based on the first half of the movie. Some good shots, dialogue etc. Still wouldn't recommend it to anyone though. Read the book if you want a good story. Hopefully one day someone will make TV series out of this and give the material the attention it needs.",4,2,5,8 September 2019
