Mission: Impossible III," Borderline cheesy but entertaining
","It certainly was entertaining. I felt every bit of the adrenaline and stress that they were feeding me. The writing was unbelievable. I really enjoyed the banter between Fishburn's character and  everyone he spoke to. And Benji's dialogues were priceless. They were so quick and, well, they were just funny.Jonathan Ryes Meyers was beautiful  even more so than our leading man. Tom Cruise was very good. I am not a Tom Cruise fan and he will never win an Oscar but he can certainly carry an action movie. I mean how many people could pull off the cheesy but very well choreographed and executed elevator escape scene. Were it not so entertaining it would have been laughable.The whole movie could have been cheesy if I had had time to think about it (which I didn't). But my absolute favorite was the spontaneous calculation of the distance of his 'Super Spidey Jump' on the window of a building in Shanghai. Unbelievable! In a nut shell, the movie was worth every bit of the $8.00 I shelled out on the ticket (maybe even the ridiculous amount I paid for my drink). You won't need to think or analyze but you will certainly enjoy the wild ride.",Null,0,1,9 May 2006
