Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Crass junior high school male humor
","Sorry I saw it. There is no doubt that he has his fans and there are definitely some funny parts, but this is very low-rate junior high school scatological humor. I'm sure some will find the nude male wrestling to be intriguing. Probably a big cult following among the gay community, though. And of course the left wing community, as it reinforces their beliefs about normal Americans. I'm sure they'll all love the Pentacostal revival scenes.Funniest parts were conversations with feminists and with drunk 'young American scholars' (who have since sued him),but they don't make up for the very unfunny parts. NOT a date movie. Maybe if you were drunk or stoned with some male high school friends. Stupid ones..Crass,crude and low rent.",3,4,9,14 November 2006
Bolt," A transcendent movie
","The best movies transcend their subject matter. Rocky won Best Picture and Rocky Balboa (Rocky VI) should have because the focus of the movies went well beyond boxing and appealed mightily to those who had no interest in the sport. And so it is with Bolt!, a Disney movie.On the surface, Bolt! is an animated kid's movie about a TV super-hero dog raised on a TV set,who never sets foot outside the studio. He is enormously believable in his TV role because he truly believes he IS a super-dog. The enemy falls at his superbark, walls tumble before him, iron bars bend in his paws, his Boltstrike causes bad guys to collapse as he valiantly saves his little girl partner Penny from doom.Then, to enhance his concern for the next show, a kidnapping is staged. Penny is kidnapped, but only until tomorrow's show. But to Bolt, it is real. He escapes to save her and by a fluke is transported across the country. When he breaks out, he is not in Hollywood, but in New York..and in the never-before-seen Real World.Slowly (and humorously), he realizes that his Super-powers are not real. But his resolve never weakens. Told repeatedly by a cat he picks up that humans do not really love animals, that a fine free life awaits him on his own, that Penny has replaced him by now and shorn of his powers, Bolt's relentless drive to return and save Penny from danger shines like a beacon on his cross-country voyage back to Hollywood and the girl he loves.Along the way, he picks up the hilarious Rhino the hamster, a big fan of his show. Rhino talks like a macho movie hero '('it's a good day to die!'), but he is of course a hamster. He believes in Bolt, the superhero. In the end, Bolt is forced to deal with a very real danger without his powers and with only his hamster sidekick and his courage as allies.In sum, the movie offers great humor,excitement and a display of nobility of character you won't see often. Take a kid or go with adults. Either way, you won't forget Bolt!",10,2,4,13 December 2008
Shooter," NOT 'Point of Impact' A political 'message'movie
","I, like every other sensible person, count Stephen Hunter's Point of Impact as one of the world's best books. And I was enthusiastic about 'Shooter' starring Mark Wahlberg. I've seen it. And despite my positive attitude, it isn't worth much. Though I can tell you why it has good reviews.The good news is that Wahlberg does a good job of playing a straight-up Rambo action hero. There is no hint of backwoods or 'country' in the character, and the words 'the nailer' are never spoken. He talks like a midwestern Harvard MBA. Kate Mara as Sarah Fenn is just beautiful and definitely Kentucky. It is a standard action flick with head shots, fights and explosions. If that's all it was, it might be worth it just to see Kate Mara in that thin t-shirt.However... it is a strong and obvious POLITICAL 'message' movie. The enemy is the US government. The 'hero' wears a 'Che' T-shirt and the bad guys have offices adorned with portraits of Republican presidents (HW Bush, Teddy Roosevelt, Herbert Hoover and Ronald Reagan). The Abu Ghraib reference and 'sitting Secretary of Defense lying' speech are typical of the movie. This movie implies a 9-11 government conspiracy and accuses our soldiers of killing women and children (for an oil pipeline,naturally). The big battle (with homemade bombs)is not with the South Americad drug cartel of the 'Panther Batallion', but with US soldiers who recently committed a massacre. The old gunsmith talks about how he was lied to about artificial sweeteners and WMD's in Iraq. The US is the source of world tragedies. Swagqer is led down the wrong path by 'patriotism'. He has never been to Vietnam, as that would imply heroic Americans might have been there. Sam Vincent the country lawyer is not there. Nick Memphis is just another FBI guy.The reason it is getting good reviews--other than it is an adequate action movie--is because of the leftist message adored by the media. It's an action movie for whacky libs, conspiracists and Bush-haters. I'm sure others will see this move. I'll be surprised if they don't report that it is more like 'Michael Moore does Point of Impact(A George Soros production)' than the book and character we all admire.",1,17,37,26 March 2007
300," A Rootin' Tootin' Heroic movie!
","You may have noted that the movie '300!' is clobbering all competitors at the box office, seen varying reviews, and wondered if it was worth it. In a word, absolutely! The plot is true, and well-known. In the Battle of Thermopylae of 480 BC an alliance of Greek city-states fought the invading Persian army in the mountain pass of Thermopylae. Vastly outnumbered, the Greeks held back the enemy in one of the most famous last stands of history. Persian King Xerxes led an Army of well over 300,000 men to Greece and was confronted by King Leonidas of Sparta and 300 Spartans (plus some Athenians). He offers them terms/promises/bribes to stand aside and join his empire, and they choose to fight, knowing they will all die, while the folks back home debate about whether to send reinforcements..Thar's the bare bones of it, but doesn't cover the truly glorious film that is 300! The photography, enhanced by computer graphics, is shockingly beautiful. The dialogue and acting is terrific. Gerrad Butler's King Leonidas makes Russell Crowe's Maximus (Gladiator) look like a choir boy in comparison. Can't see how you could do better short of Richard Burton. There is an excellent extensive female part, and it would be a mistake to think of this as just a 'guy's' movie'. There is even some definite humor. My wife loved it. You WILL be drawn in and emotionally involved. Quite a few audiences seem to applaud at the end. They should.You may have heard this is violent. Well,sort of. It is a genuine epic with many fight scenes. The film editor never uses the same camera angle twice, and the combination of color and shading makes for an absolute beautiful vision. Much thought had also been put into the music, and sound effects chosen by the director. But there really is little blood and no spilled innards, though there are antiseptic severed limbs and heads.You may have heard that this is a 'political'' movie, and it is true the the Iranians are not fond of it. I didn't see it that way. Greece WAS the foundation of Democracy and Western Civilization, and the invading army WAS Persian. Can't change reality.In sum, the movie really is the words that are over-used. Spectacular. Epic. Glorious. Beautiful. Heroic.A '10'. For sure. Go see it. And don't wait for the DVD.",10,4,11,19 March 2007
