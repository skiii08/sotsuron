The Avengers," Super Surprised - And that's Good
","I expected the worst for this movie. I really did.I expected just a bunch of special effects and no story.I was pleasantly surprised that this movie is actually very very good. And yes, I was right about the special effects. But this movie does have a heart and a story. I liked the way they brought all of the characters together. I even liked the soundtrack.I highly recommend this movie. I think it ranks as perhaps the best comic book superhero movie ever made. And I've seen them all. I used to think that the 1978 Superman:The Movie and 1981 Superman II couldn't be surpassed. In 2002 the first Spiderman movie came close to being as good as the first two superman movies, but I still believed the Superman movies still tops until this movie. This is the comic book movie that finally dethroned The first two superman movies in my humble opinion. Yes, I think it is that good",8,0,5,25 April 2013
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Unlike the Original Trilogy
","I had a different attitude toward this film than did most people, because I have never seen this film as being a true Star Wars film. to me this film is more of what you would call a spin off movie,Like those 2 made for TV Ewok films(only these are about the early adventures of OB1 Kenobi instead of Ewoks)The prequel trilogy is not(and will never be) true Star Wars. However, I have seen this film called the worst film ever made- I thinks that is over stating it just a bit! This is not the worst film ever made, but Star Wars it isn't. I believe that Geoprge Lucas would have been better off to have made the prequel trilogy as its own entity, and having no ties to star wars.this film at best gets 3 out of 5 stars from me. If you've never seen it,the special effects alone are worth watching it at least twice, and the Light-saber fight scene is the best one they ever filmed. I wish Darth Maul would've played a larger role in the film. I felt that the whole virgin birth of Darth Vader and the references to ancient Jedi legend about the ONE who will bring balance to the force-I felt that was all unnecessary. and the I believe that the pod racing scene should've been done different, I dont think any mother in her right frame of mind is going to be that willing to let her son drive something that fast,furious and deadly- the story would've shown more of Anakin's will power to disobey and do his own thing if the writer would have had him to sneak off and race the pod.I also felt that the concept of Anakin Skywalker is the one who built C3-PO  was also unnecessary(then why didn't he remeber C3-PO in the other episodes-get my point)--it sounds like I disliked the film but in truth I liked it,but to me, I will always see this film(and its 2 sequels)as a Star Wars spin off and not true part of Star Wars itself.",6,0,1,3 April 2002
Minority Report," cross'Tek War' with 'The Fugitive', and you get Minority Report
","As good as this film is, it is laced with feelings that you've already seen all of this before.(Its called Movietime Dija Vue) its when you watch a film for the very first time and because of it's similarities with other films , you feel like you've already seen it.--you even seen the plot twist coming. Thats how I felt when I watched Minority Report. The only thing I didn't see coming was Tom Cruise' bald shaven head (somebody get that boy some Rogain).Dispite all the similarities with other films, I have to give this film its proper credit. The special effect are so good in this film, that I wouldn't be the least surprised if it beats out Star Wars:Episode 2 at the oscars for best special effects.The Special effects in this film are that GOOD. I've seen many other Not-so-distant future films have similar effects and similar digital-computurized futuristic landscapes.(examples: Tek War, Demolition Man, A.I., Gattaca, the list goes on)but never have I seen it done on the same size and scale as Minority Report.(the geneticaly altered plants - I thought that was a bit silly). This film is amazing to watch. The chase scene on a futuristic super-highway is one of the best chase scenes ever!Although there are aspects of this film that are both groundbreaking and original, you still get the feeling that you've been here before in other films. In many ways this film Paralells 'The Fugitive-1993' with the theme of an innocent man on the run. However, on many levels it also paralells those 'Tek War' made for TV  movies that the Fox network produced during the mid-1990's, with the theme of a good cop addctied to substance abuse,framed by greedy politcians,so he can be made into a public example,to win public support so they can get legislation passed. (Tek War-starring William Shatner and Greg Evigan, was also set in the future, and featured many similar graphics and themes as Minority Report).I also thought the ending of this film was too anti-climactic I give this film 7 out of 10 stars",Null,0,0,25 July 2002
Star Trek," Are the people who are giving this movie high marks over the age of 14?
","They should have named this movie 'Star Trek: Abomination'. I don't know where to get started.how about the plot!:::::: WARNING –SPOILER ALERT::::::::::::::::::Now, I don't have a problem with J.J. Abrams doing a Star Trek movie that is a Prequel to the original 1966-69 TV series. I know that many of my fellow Trekkies had issues with that, However, I didn't have any issues with that. That is not my gripe.My biggest gripe is the plot, I mean did adults actually write this script? And if Yes, then did they ever go to science class? ((( and how the hell does it have an 8.0 rating here on IMDb, didn't any of the people who saw this go to science class either? Okay, the movie is about a renegade Romulan Captain named Nero who travels back in time 80 years just to get revenge on Ambassador Spock for failing to save his home planet in the future. Apparently Ambassador Spock was going to stop the Romulan sun from going Super Nova by injecting it with something called red matter that would implode their sun and created a artificial black hole. Did it not occur to anyone that if you implode a star and create a black hole, which the Black Hole created would also destroy the Romulan home planet? So either way the planet would've been destroyed. And why doesn't Nero ever go to his home planet and warn them about the coming future catastrophe, No, instead he just floats around in space for 25 years doing nothing as he is waiting for Spock to arrive. This is just stupid. Then J.J.Abrams has Nero destroy the planet Vulcan, thus destroying 50 years worth of canonized Star Trek movies and television shows (all of which involve planet Vulcan). And what's up with those product placement ads.. come on man, this is Star Trek, 300 years in the future and people are still using Nokia phones, drinking Budweiser, and driving Chevrolets.. C'mon man oh and still is listening to the Beastie Boys too. .again this was an abomination to Star Trek",4,6,9,11 May 2013
Spider-Man 2," As much as I loved the first one ....this one is even better
","I expected this film to be good, but I didn't expect it to be better than the first one ....but it was.This film is great. I absolutlty loved it. I would recommend this film to any one at any age. It's just pure fun with a great story, & some really great special effects thrown in with it.this franchise in my opinion has now asserted itself as the premier film franchise in the comic book/superhero genre. I really think that all future comic book/superhero films are going to have to look back on Spiderman 1 & 2 as the new standard setters to beat in that genre.I give it 10 out 10 stars",10,1,2,10 February 2005
X-Men," X- Men
",I didn't know what to epectfrom this film .........I was never sure if i liked it or not. It just seemed like it could've flowed better -- other comic book movies like first 3 Superman movies and the first 2 Batman films blow 'X-Men' out of the Water ........but X-Men isn't all that bad....it has several good parts.,Null,0,0,17 May 2003
Blade II," Better than the First One
","If you liked Blade part 1 , you're gonna love Blade 2 even better. this is the Vampire movie that Queen of the Damned wished it could've been. Blade is lured into a treaty(truce)with the Vampire nation to help them go to war with an Genetic enhanced vampires called Reapers. The plot is simple but this movie is one fight scene after another and after another. The plot take a diabolical twist. and it was very clever the way the author brought Whistler back to life. I enjoyed this film very much, I plan to go see it again while it is still playing at the local theater. I give it 4 out of 5 stars",7,0,1,3 April 2002
Barry Lyndon," this was okay
","I usualy like two types of movies,movies about the old world like this one, and modern space epics like star wars and star trek. and this one falls under the same catagory as films like 'The Man in the Iron Mask' or 'The Patriot', only thing is that those films are much better than this one.- however this is one of the most beautifuly cinematography in a movie that I ever seen,Ddespite the Bazaar way this film plays out. I dont believe any film has ever captured the feel of the late 1700's better than this film did. the costumes are great,and sets are perfect. I also liked the whole natural light method in which this film was made.And the story is set into 2 halves, the first half is the rise Redmon Barry, and the 2nd half is the fall of Barry Lyndon(who are the same person)I even liked the narration of this film(I normaly despise narration- but the narration worked perfect for this film). This is a very classy film, and all of the actors did an outstanding job.(BTW:this film won 4 oscars). I reccomend this film, -you may or may not like it(I liked it but will also admit that other films in this same genre will blow it away -I found it interesting that a box set was released in 2000 with all of Kubrick's films in it- but this one(Barry Lyndon)was the only Kubrick film not in the box set. Kubrick knew that this film couldn't stand up to other films in this genre which is why he called it a failure-He believed at the time he was filming it that this was going to be his 'Gone With the Wind' sweeping epic that would be endured for all times - and it never became that). This film also has one of the most unusual music scores I ever heard,the only way to describe the music in this film is wierd.But If you really liked this film you need to See 'Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe Series,' any of the A&E 'Horatio Hornblower' movies or 'The Patriot'(Starring Mel Gibson)because after seeing truely great movies like those, you will soon forget about Barry Lyndon. I will give it 3 out of 5 stars -Its still a much underated good movie",5,2,19,9 April 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," By George,he got it
","I went to this film not believing that It would be much better than Episode I, MAN! was I in for a PLEASENT SURPRISE! this film rocked. I  always felt like Episode I felt more like a spin-off film rather than A true Star Wars film, NOT TRUE with Episode II. now this IS Star Wars. It did remind me of 'The 5th Element' toward the begining of the film during the Skycar chase sceen. And this film did slow down into two halves, the OBI-WON half which is a detective(who dunnit) story line--and the other half of this film is the Anikin half wich is a slow sweeping love story. The Actor playing Anikin is perfect for his role. George Lucas redeemed both himself and the Star Wars franchise with this film. My only complaint is that the tital 'Attack of the Clones' is mis-leading because the clones are the good guys helping the Jedi to fight a Droid Army. I thing a better tital would have been 'Jedi Master Yoda Kicks Ass'--because that was one of the highlights of this film for me(everyone in the movie theater busted out laughing and at the same time cheering during Yoda's fight scene-it was great!).I will probably see this film at leat 2 more times while it is still showing at the theater, and now I thinking of watching Episode I  all over again. My only other disapointment was that I had read some internet rumors that Jedi Master Jourus C'boath, and Grand Admiral Thrawn(from the Timothy Zahn novels)were going to have a small bit-parts in this film,and they didn't..... but thats okay--this is the Star Wars film we've all been waiting for since 1983. I cannot wait to see Episode III. I give it 9 stars out of 10 - near perfect film",8,0,1,24 May 2002

Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Coming Soon- Terminator 4 : Warriors of the Wasteland
","Coming Soon- Terminator 4 : Warriors of the Wasteland ???? Not really, I just made that title up.... But that was exactly how I felt after the somber (cliffhanger without actualy being a cliffhanger) ending.I went to this with an open mind (since Jim Cameron didn't produce it). After all, didn't Jim Cameron have a breakthrough success with 'ALIENS'...and he didn't produce the first one... so I kept an open mind
This one had much more humor in it than the 2 previous films, the whole theater errupted with uncontrolable laughter at the 'TALK TO THE HAND!' scene at the begining of the film. The chase scene was great too (MATRIX 2's chase scene blows T3's chase Scene away). and yes the plot did have some holes.... but I can over look those holes because the plot holes seem to be what keeps the story line going from one film to the next (in other words, plot holes are a necesary evil if you want to keep the story going).I couldn't help but feel like this film was acting as a bridge story that is setting the stage for future Terminator movies (probably without Arnald)that will take place in the futuristic post nuclear war landscape where humans are fighting the war against the machines....In a strange kinda way, I hope that is exactly what is happening with this franchise... we'll see in the futureI give this film 7 out of 10 stars -go see it, its pretty good",Null,0,0,6 July 2003
The Patriot," This was the best film of the year 2000!
","I dont know where the Motion Picture academy was in 2000 because this movie was the best film of the year 2000! This is the best Revolutionary war movie ever(though there haven't been that many revolutionary war movies-I have always wondered why but Hollywood has always acted like there has only ever been 2 wars- WWII and the Civil War). One of the things that made this film so unique is that it deals with the Revolutionary war in a fashion that is a drama, war story,love story, and a action movie all rolled into one film-and it is great! Given the subject matter and scope of this film,I dont think there is another film to compare it too. I believe this to be Mel Gibson's best movie ever. everthing is perfect in thisfilm- the acting is great,the photography is magnificent,the costumes are well done, the story as captivating as it is interesting,the special effects  are AWESOME, and the music score is also very well done. - This film is a masterpiece. I had to see it 3 times at the theater and I bought a DVD of it as soon as it went on sale, I also purchased the soundtrack(film score) on CD. this film is inspiring and entertaining at the same time. I read somewhere that this film was based on a real person,however I have never found any real person that corresponds to depictions in this film-I do not believe this was based on a real person,I dont even know how stuff like that gets started. Although this film is fairly recent(made in 2000) it has already taken it's place as one of my all time favorite movies. As far as the Academy Awards go, this wasn't the first time I've seen them totaly miss the years truly best film(remember in 1998 Les Miserables didn't get nominated for anything either)I give the Patriot it 5 out of 5 stars - A perfect film - its great",9,0,1,18 April 2002
Spider-Man," The Best Superhero Film since Superman II
","Hollywood has always suffered from bad Superhero movies(example:X-Men, Batman Series)however I'm glad to say that this film isn't one of those films. this film is simply splended and good fun. In fact its the best superhero film since Superman II all the way back in 1981. I hope to see a sequel come out soon. I liked the story, I liked the acting, The special effects are good, and the music score is good.  this movie hits on all 8 cylinders.- its great! I enjoyed this film alot. This film reminded me of the 1st Superman movie(1978) in several ways, If you like Superhero films this is going to be one of your favorites- I promise you that! I give this film 8 out of 10 stars -- you're gonna like this movie",8,0,0,17 May 2002
Alien vs. Predator," They have been trying for years to get this film made....so what
","They have been trying for years to get this film made....so what did you think of it? Is it what you expected? Is this the film you would've'e made if you were in control? If you are like most of us then your answers to the above questions are probably No, No, No and No However it is not all bad ....in fact there were parts of this film that I really enjoyed. My biggest disappointment is that it didn't follow the ALIEN VS PREDATOR story lines that I have learn to enjoy from the paper back novels and comic books.I wanted to see a movie about humans in the future who are at war with the predator race in space and both are using the alien as a weapon against each other (just like in the novels) Needless to say that isn't the film they made.....I'm afraid this film falls under the category of movies that i like to call 'what could have been...films' Had they followed the story lines used in the paperback novels this could have been the birth of a new major sci-fi franchise that would rivaled the likes of Star Wars, BattleStar Galactica, and Star Trek.Instead we get to see a gang of twenty somethings go glob trotting in Antartica in a underground pyramid (and most of them are killed off before you even get to know the characters) --and the rest of the movie was just a special effect show At least it was entertaining..and it did have some decent special effects I gave it 5 out of 10 stars",5,1,2,6 March 2005
2012," The Mother of all Missed Opportunities
","This movie was the mother of all missed opportunities.First off, I never once believed that the World was going to come to an end in 2012. But despite that, I still enjoyed this movie, its not a bad movie, it just could have been so much better than it is.I am a Science Fiction writer, and there were several things that I would have down sooooo... different.for one, I would have given this movie a proper movie title that would've given it a shelf life beyond 2012. I would have named it 'The Great Cancellation' or something like that.secondly, I would have those Ark ships as Space ships (as the movies has us to believe until they actually find them)...yes, I would have made those space ships. Then I would have ended the movie with those space ships blasting off into space, the survivors would've watched from space as the Earth's crust melts into liquid magma.... then I would've ended it with those space ships floating through space towards destination unknown......If they would have done as I suggested, then this might could have been the beginning of a great new Sci-Fi movie series that follows the survivors of Earth as they look for a new home in the stars...that could have been an exciting movie series, but instead we are left with '2012' a movie that has amazing special effects, a short shelf life and not much more....Yes, this is the mother is missed opportunities. Too Bad, So Sad.",5,1,2,21 May 2013
X-Men: The Last Stand," Xremely good ....... the best of the 3 movies
",The first X-Men movie was just okay (so-so)The second X-Men movie was really-really goodBut the third X-Men movie was the best of the series.These movie kept getting better with each new one that they made. Usually it works the other way around. X3 was great. I was however surprised when some of the main characters were killed off early in the movie. ::::::::spoiler alert:::::::::: Dr. Jean Grey has been resurrected from the dead and now she has the personality of the Pheonix spirit that has taken over her personality. In other words she becomes evil. and Megneto and his band of outlaw the Mutants rally around her and create chaos. and its up to the last remaining/surviving X-Men to stop her. this movie is way better than either of its prequels ... this movie is great. It is a must see for any fan of comic book movies or superheros.,8,0,2,27 February 2007

","I Dont say this lightly, but this is The Best Movie Series Ever! ! !I have never read the books,but this movie (and its predessor) have got to be the gresatest triumph ever put on film.The only thing I didn't like about 'Lord of the Rings 2: The Two Towers' movie were the talking trees, and the scene were the trees go to war. That was just too much in my opinion. I'm not blaming the movie makers for that, because I'm sure that material was in the book too(again I've never read the books). Aside from talking Trees going to war, I believe you can dail 'P' for perfection - this movie delivers all the goods.I have now given both Lord of the Rings movies a perfect 10 stars",9,0,0,21 December 2002
K-19: The Widowmaker," Hunt for Red October sinks this film - no pun intended
","I found this movie to be well acted, well produced, and over all well made. I must confess that 2 of my 3 all time favorite actors appear in this film together (Liam Neeson and Harrison Ford)- that alone made this film a must see......If they had casted Tommy Lee Jones as an extra in this film they would have had all 3 of my all time favorite actors(maybe next time).If some could cast all 3 of them in one film together it would be the greatest film of all time - i dont care if it what it would be about it would be awesome.(it wouldn't matter if you cast these three men as recovering Crack addict Irish sheep hearders starting a modern day sheep ranch in Vermont- if Mr.Jones, Mr. Ford and Mr. Neeson all three in it together, it would still end up as a masterpiece.- that how good of actors these 3 men are.I  only complaint with K-19 is that it  moves at a slow pace, and with all sub-marine films there is no scenery,the musical score fantastic(I plan to purchase a copy of the score on CD  to listen too in my car).Very well acted be 2 of the best in the business. Good special effects. I liked the idea of watching this drama unfold through the eyes of the Soviet Union. this film is very intelegent. this film explores the human emotions when faced with life and death decisions during he cold war better than any cold war related film I've ever seen.I gave it 8 out of 10 stars",Null,0,0,25 July 2002

Sprint PCS, IBM Computers, Burger King, Victorias Secret, Rayban, Mercedes Benz, and Reebok --all got thier commercails cleverly placed in this film.. I'm starting to notice more and more background commercails in films...example did you see the Cingular Wireless commercail in Spiderman, or the Lexus commercail in Minority Report? if you didn't notice - trust me,they are there - but Men In Black 2 had more background commercails than any film I've ever seen.Overall - I give this film 4 out of 10 stars, mainley because it was just like  the 1st movie, the music sucked, and there was absolutely no emotion in this film, just some really cool specail effects and some dry humor that isn't funny, your kids will like it, but you may not",5,1,2,3 December 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Very Clever
","I wasn't a big fan of the first Harry Potter film, so I was exactly trilled when my 7 year old niece wanted to see this, when we were in the line at the movies (afterall we'd gone there to see Disney's Treasure Plenet -not Harry Potter) anyway like a good uncle I agreed to see Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets instead. I have too admit that I was pleasantly surprised. Much,Much better than the first one in every way possible, much, much funnier than the first one, better story than the first one. I have no choice but to admit that I loved this little film. The Children actors chosen for these roles are perfect for these roles. This film is so much fun. I recommend it to anyone. - for just a moment I was taken back to my childhood and was remembering watch Gene Wilder in Willie Wonka and the Chocolet Factory, and I sat back for a moment and looked at my 7 year old niece as her eyes were glued to the movie screen... and I thought to myself that Harry Potter really is magic.8 out of 10 stars - as good as it gets for Childrens movies, and Adults are gonna like it too (good fun for all ageas)",8,0,0,5 January 2003
War of the Worlds," War of the Worlds = Independence Day = Battlefield Earth
","WAR OF THE WORLDS = INDEPENDENCE DAY = BATTLEFIELD EARTHWell not exactly. But Yes....well, sort of.....let me explain I am well aware that this is a remake of an old movie from the 1950's...and I am also aware that the concept/Inspiration behind INDEPENDENCE DAY was borrowed from the L.Ron Hubbard's classic sci-fi novel 'BattleField Earth' (then John Travolta filmed 'Batlefield Earth' as its own movie 4 years after Indepenence Day came out...my god this is all getting confusing isn't it .and it gets more confusing if you've seen the movie 'BATTLEFIELD EARTH', John Travolta produced the movie himself, and totally left out the entire Alien Invasion of Earth, and elected instead to just pick the story up 1000 years in the future(1000years of Alien occupation of Earth, and man is an endangered species) Travolta did it that way only because he didn't want his BATTLEFIELD EARTH movie to appear to the public like it was a clone of INDEPENDENCE DAY.......However Dean Devlin's idea for the movie script for INDEPENDENCE DAY was inspired by reading the novel 'BattleField Earth',,,,,,,,are you Confused now?---if you still confused, let me give you the short version....the idea for the movie Independence Day was actually stolen from L.Ron Hubbard's Battlefield Earth novel. Independence Day made a ton of money at the box office....which provoked John Travolta who is a scientologist to make a movie based on the real 'BattleField Earth', only to have Battlefield Earth fail at the box office(big time failure) SIDE-NOTE: Scientology is a religion that was started & founded by science fiction novelist L.Ron Hubbard. John Travolta is a dedicated member to that religious sect...........and guess who else is a member of this sect....you guessed it...Tom Cruise.so this time it's Tom Cruise doing his version of an Alien Invasion movie...Hmmmmmmm ---i've spent too much time giving the unique history these 3 movies share..now I'll talk about the movie itself Now enter in.....2005 and renowed Film Maker Steven Spielberg spearheads the remake 'War of the Worlds' Now having said that... I didn't bother going to see this movie when it was showing in theaters...because I just assumed that it was going to be a repeat of INDEPENDENCE DAY.War of the Worlds turned out to be a pleasant surprise...it was nothing like Independence Day or Battlefield Earth. Awesome special effects, great story, good stunts, plenty of action. It has a great music score.

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Force is back for the Final Attack
","this movie makes up for the short falls of it's two prequels. The two previous films didn't really fell like I was watching a star wars movie, instead they felt more like star wars spin offs that should have been called 'This Young Obi-Won & Anakin Adventures'.However this is not true of Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.Revenge of the Sith manages to capture all of the Star Wars energy and all of its glory. this movie rocks the house. the music and special effects are excellent. The acting is good, and the story is great. I have already seen this film 4 times at the theater, and I cannot wait to own a copy of this for my own personal DVD collection, this will be one of those rare movies that I will be watching over and over again (and loving it more each time) As time marches on, there is no doubt in my mind that this movie will soon leave episode I & II in the dust and join the same ranks as episodes IV,V,& VI as one of the all time great sci-fi masterpeices",10,2,8,29 May 2005

Great cast, Great Story, Great Special Effects, Good Humor, Lots of Action, A Love Story, and betrayal, and a good musical score. What more do you want from a movie. This had it all.Its the Story of Tony Stark and how he becomes Iron Man. He's rich, He's immature, and he's a genius. The movie does a very good job of showing Tony Stark evolve into a more mature man as he finds new purpose in his life following a capture in the Afghanistan Desert. The movie does a brilliant job at bringing both his struggles as he becomes a better person, and his battles with evil, and the betrayal of his own company's CEO who becomes the villain.

Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," The Best Vampire Film ever made!
","I've never been very fond of Vampire films in the past-I like very few of them.most of them are just plain silly(Dracula 2000,Dusk til Dawn,Vampirella,Queen of the Damned,Fright Night,Vamp,Buffy the Vampire Slayer,John Carpenter's Vampires -just to name a few, I think you get the idea)Although I normaly find Vampire films silly -This has got to be the Best Vampire Film ever made! When you compare this film to other Vampire films(see titles listed above)this film is in a class by itself. however this film falls more along the lines of a period drama than a horror story, and it's spellbounding to watch. I got so into this film that I didn't want this movie to end. Several great actors and they all did a terrific job.Tom Criuse gave the best ever performance of his career as LeStat, Brad Pitt also had his career best performance in this film too. The music score is fantastic, the costumes are great, but this film keeps a somber feeling from start to finish. you can't take your eyes off of this film,You dont simply watch this film, you EXPERIENCE it. I missed this film when it was playing at the theater, and I didn't bother to rent it when it came out on video. I was at my brothers house and my sister-in-law played it in thier VCR (The movie had been out for at least 4 or 5 years) So I was a late bloomer to this film.-And I was captivated by it. I went 2 days later and purchased the film. It is one of only 2 Vampire films I have ever purchased for my own personal home video library(Bram Stoker's Dracula-1993 being the other -I also like the Blade films,but I consider them to be action films and not a true Vampire film). Upon watching this film the 2nd time, I realized what a great movie experience Interview with the Vampire is and what I had been missing out on all these years. I LOVE THIS FILM. I give it 5 out of 5 stars- A perfect film",Null,1,2,14 April 2002
Gangs of New York," Not the average run of the mill movie
","As I was going to see this film, I already knew what is was going to be about, and before I seen it,I already loved the story concept (even If I hated the title - It should've been called 'Ashes of the Irish' or something like  that). but for what ever reason they chose to name this film 'Gangs of New York', and it wasn't the film I thought it was going to be. First I'd like to say that Daneil Day Lewis played his role perfect. He did so good in his role as the butcher that I cannot imagine any another actor in that role (Really). I also liked the surreal, Dirty,Brutal,Gritty old 19th century New York City setting..I though the sets were fantastic. The Special effects were pretty standard(which means pretty good these days), and Liam Neeson was also very convincing as the boys father,too bad that his character was only in the movie for about the first 15 minutes of the film.However what hurt this film is that it is way too long, and you almost feel like the director is trying to drag it out further with a series of scenes that have little or no bearing on the story. Cameron Diaz and Leonardo DiCaprio were the way wrong choices for this film. I remeber thinking to myself as I was watching it that Colin Farrell or Ewan McGregor would've been much more better suited for the role of Anstredam than DiCaprio was. And Diaz is much too much of a modern California girl to star in this period film set in 19th century New York City and it shows. Again I found myself recasting that role to Kristen Dunst or Heather Graham who I believe would've been for better in that role than Diaz. Niether Diaz or DiCaprio are convincing and there acting skills are just flat all the way through this film. Another pitfall of this film is the miserable film score. the pulsating hich school marching band style snare drums that continuously play to a fast paced beat actually begins to give you a headache before the film  is finished.Its worth watching at least once...I dont know if it was too much or not enough, this music score is god-aweful, but I gave it 6 stars out of 10.",6,0,0,5 January 2003
Windtalkers," is there a such thing as Too Realistic?
","is there a such thing as Too Realistic? there answer is no, exept in the ther war genre, then the answer is yes. Why, would I say that? because do you and I need to see brutal, bloody and gruesome  dipictions of violence to know that war is ugly? ...ther answer is 'of course not' -- this film disturbed me. First, I want to say that this film has a great & wonderful story.this film is perfectly cast, and very well acted. the special effect are flawless (the effects are too good -I'll explain later). the film score is beautiful.This film is handsomely photographed and the scenery is amazing.and the battle scenes are some of the best i've ever seen.I have no quarrells in calling this John Woo's finest production to date.However, I want to call this a near perfect film,but there is one small problem. This is not a film I could watch over and over. The brutal violence and gore in this film are just too much(although realistic) I felt was unescesary. this is more voilent and gorey than Saving Private Ryan.(Ask yourself these questions - is all of that gore nescesary to tell this story?? Do you enjoy watching this much gore and violence?? - for me the answer is no on both questions)I do believe that in order to tell an effective war story that you do need to show some degree of bloodshed.--however,this film goes so far over the top that I  began to wonder if this film was just made to be a special effects showcase of carnage. --And I'm not suggesting in any way that war stories should be presented like fairy tales, however I am suggesting that there is a such thing as too much gore.(how much is too much? - when the producer has pounded you with so much carnage that it is no longer contributing anything to the story,then he has gone too far, and that is what happened with this film) I give this film 6 stars out of 10 - see it once. dont eat anything before you see it",Null,0,1,25 July 2002
V for Vendetta," This movie is like a Coca-Cola that has lost it's fizzle
","This movie is like a Coca-Cola, RC Cola or Pepsi that has gone flat and lost it's fizzle. When a soda pop goes flat, it still has all of its tasty ingredients in tact, but it just isn't any good That is the analogy I'd use to describe this movie. It's a soda pop with no fizzle. Is very accurate. V for Vendetta is a movie with all of the good ingredients it needed to be great. A Decent cast, excellent special effects, a great story premises, a good musical score, well coordinated stunts and fight scenes. But despite having all of the good ingredients..it just isn't very good When I first saw the previews for this movie, I thought it was going to be one of the greatest movies ever made, and I could not wait to see it. I had this preconceived notion that it was going to be a cross between Zorro and Goerge Orwells '1984' all rolled into one movie with a vengeance oriented plot. I was very disappointed.The story moves at a much slower pace than I was expecting( a very-very slow pace)- In fact, it crawls. There was no where near the amount of action that the previews indicated that there was going to be....In fact it is a very-very talkative movie. True there are some good action sequences, and they are done well, there just isn't enough of them, and the action scenes are too far apart and too few of them.::::::::::::::::::::: spoiler alert:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: I was never able to comprehend the fact that the lead character named 'V' kidnapped Natalie Portman's Character, tortured her, shaved her head, starved her, and even killed her friend who was protecting her... and then not only did she still trust him and she even came back to him to help after all of the hell he put her through. - - - - - - That was just STUPID! - - - - - From that point in the movie, until the end, it was now an insult to my intelligence, and unenjoyable.A said before .... This movie is like a Coca-Cola, RC Cola or Pepsi that has gone flat and lost it's fizzle. When a soda pop goes flat, it still has all of the ingredients needed for greatness, but it has no fizzle and just isn't any good",5,3,8,27 February 2007
