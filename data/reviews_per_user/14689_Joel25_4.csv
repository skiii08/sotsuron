3:10 to Yuma," cowboys and indians
","As an action-adventure Western this is competent enough to permit enjoyment. It overuses much-used cinematic vocabulary to situate us in a fairly structured and very familiar world, but it comes at a cost. Into this world of ready made notions and symbols it pours the ingredients of a transformational psychological drama and leaves it to the characters to work or not.Unfortunately for me, the characters are ideas rather than personalities. Rusty Crowe;s character is more god or mystagogue than human (he plays this role very well, I must add). He plays the manufacturer of myths, which is great, but he is also the model, which is not. The specific notion of manhood that he defines is adolescent, idealised, and unlivable. He is the fulfilled wish of a 14yo boy with an ordinary dad who lacks an heroic myth to insulate his identity, not someone who bleeds real blood.For a psychological drama that requires a solution of a moral conflict to succeed, I think, it needs real human emotion rather than a language, visual or otherwise, that represents emotion. How do you achieve real human emotion in a movie? An Ariadne thread that provides a connection to reality no matter how deep into the labyrinth of illusion they tread. The 'Western' is so stylised by now that to aspire to this reality of emotions with a straight bat seems misguided. Ironies, folds, and other quirky calculations are surely needed to communicate to the audience the nature of this problem and a reasonable resolution. This didn't have enough awareness of itself. It is up to you to decide whether the resolution you observed was acceptable. But if you do accept it, you;re not pushing hard enough on the skin of your mind.",Null,1,3,12 December 2007
Monster," Unjustified
","The filmmaker's avowed intention here was to compensate the media portrayal of Aileen Wuornos - which was supposedly designed to show the public just how evil and worthy of a death sentence she was - by honouring the complexity of a life.Not what happens. Instead we get a complex life reduced to simplicity through an essentially melodramatic mode of presentation, all designed to justify the filmmaker's sympathetic response to the real courtroom events.Everyone knows about Theron's performance. But every other element of the film suffers for it, orchestrated, as they are, to place the focus solely on Theron, and distract from what is really going on behind the camera. Without the strutting performance of Theron, this would be a TV movie.",2,3,9,19 February 2005
Amadeus," Through the eyes of mediocrity
","This is a fine example of what Bordwell & Thompson call 'classical Hollywood film-making,' and what Mark Cousins, in his book, The Story of Film, defines as 'closed romantic realism.' The defining mark of this method is a rigourous narrative order where everything is ultimately explainable. Every door that is openedshuts.This method creates worlds or worldviews that could only be regulated by a rational (pre-existential) god. Every event has its place on a causal chain, every loose end is tied up, and there is no room for ambiguity or chance.Of course, we're looking at this through Salieri's eyes, and whatever we see could be explained as a kink in his insane mind. But it doesn't really matter. What we have is a scrupulously sane recounting of events that led Salieri to the mental institution. There is a unity to this retelling that is a reflection of Salieri's understanding of events sewn in to the story's form. Every event in the film is motivated. There is not a look, a phrase, a camera move that is not subservient to the aims of the story. The characters' motives are transparent and conform to an uncomplicated, clearly readable, psychology.We have an aesthetic of sensation to keep the audience entertained, and all that is missing there is the sex. It is censored out by Salieri's chaste consciousness, substituted for sweets. This sounds like a particular brand of mainstream cinema, which Salieri actually embodies. Competent enough but without depthlacking magic.We get to indirectly recognise that magic, but never do we see its point of view.This is a celebration of the Salieris of the world, not the Mozarts.",Null,2,4,3 January 2007
Chariots of Fire," Orders of Allegiance
","Perhaps it was the shambles of the 1980 Moscow Olympics that justified a dramatic examination of the personal and political machinery that drives Olympic athletes and draws an audiencethe motives, the principles, the ideals, nationalist, religious, or otherwise. If this is true, we have the reason why this film would flop today. It struggles to breathe outside of its historical context.Elements of this can still be appreciated. One, the manner in which it compares the different machinery (order of allegiances) driving Abrahams and Liddell, revealing the full consequences of each character's drive without hammering the point into our skulls or overtly moralising. Both cross the finish line first, but only one wins. Two, the ambitious and much-talked-about Vadelis score that has aged without grace. It has been described elsewhere as striking a balance between classicism and futurism. I can't deny that, however, I think this balance arises more from the nature of the instrument useda modern synthesizerfor a drama set in the 1920s. This anachronism results in an ironic pleasure separate from whatever dramatic and aesthetic value the actual music possesses, similar to Woody Allen inversely placing 1920s slapstick in the context of a futuristic dystopia in 'Sleeper'. I could have forgiven the film's reliance on context if it had of managed to harness the inherent self-referential power of its scenarios, but it did not. We have a staggering number of scenes that revolve around the notion of performing for an audience (the essence of film). Not just the races, but a play, a sermon, a lecture, a memorial, a training session, a musical numberand no hint of self-awareness, no leveraging of the idea that this film itself is a performance for an audience. Instead we get a straight story only, drearily oblivious that it too, like its characters, is driven by the political, theoretical, and technological machinery behind it.",Null,0,1,3 January 2007
