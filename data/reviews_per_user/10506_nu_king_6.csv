The Devil's Advocate," it was excellent
","I have seen this movie and I have to admit it is very good. An excellent screenplay and casting. Though some of the scenes were too intense, I believe it goes along with the plot. Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino were brilliant in the performance!",Null,0,1,1 May 2001
Unbreakable," One of the Best Movies Ever Made!
","After seeing The Sixth Sense, created by M.Night Shyamalan, I was truly astonished and loved the surprise thrilling ending. It was a new genre of film making, as I recognized it. However, when I saw Unbreakable, I was fascinated by the idea Night had created and it was brilliant!!!(Please if you haven't seen this movie stay away from people who have cause they will ruin it for you) The ending of this movie was the most thrilling scene I've ever seen. Night really captures you into the story and gives you a unique feeling that the supernatural is everywhere just like he did in The Sixth Sense!!
Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson gives one of their best performances ever!!! Excellent acting, directing and screenplay!!I give this movie two thumbs up!! WATCH IT!",6,0,0,2 August 2001

",Snatch is one of my most favorite movies of all time. Guy Ritchi brings in a good sense of humor and style to this movie. I couldn't stop laughing at some of the humorous scenes. If you haven't seen this movie you have to see it now! The acting was quite good and this movie brought on a sense of gangster related activities with portrayal of humorous doltishness. I give this movie TWO THUMBS UP!! GO WATCH IT!!!,10,0,1,10 August 2001
