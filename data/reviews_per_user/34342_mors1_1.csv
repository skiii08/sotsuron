Mission: Impossible III," A (very near) Perfect Action Film
","With a shocking and dramatic opening, this film grabs hold of you within 10 seconds and doesn't let go until the very end.JJ Abrams (the man who has written over 70 episodes of the hugely popular TV series LOST) is integral to the creation of this film, both directing and writing, and it shows. The film is extremely high-paced and unpredictable from the very beginning and its 120min running time is not at all overcooked. The many fans of LOST will love this film and those who simply enjoy high-paced explosive action will find it equally brilliant. That is not to say it is simply constant action with no intelligent plot (die hard 4 anyone?), the plot is intriguing and the script is tight throughout. The two lead roles are also performed superbly by both Cruise and the unexpected but brilliant casting of Hoffman, who's character is unpredictable with a dangerous edge.Whilst the shocking beginning hooks viewers and the high-paced and unpredictable nature of every action scene provides a real thrill-ride, the film also has a real dramatic edge - 10/10(i would suggest that those who dislike the film due to a love for the original TV series or the franchise just view this as a separate movie!)",10,0,1,13 August 2007
