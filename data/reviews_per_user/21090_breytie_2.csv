Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Here is nothing to learn
","My impression of Americans is that they are big mouthed. But I cannot say that I know or even vaguely understand the American psyche. When I chose to see this film, it was to learn more about Americans. Surely there must be something to learn from a nation who leads the world and who keeps on producing leaders and leading discoveries for the rest of the world to follow. It also surely says a lot that a nation can succeed in extending it's culture around the world. I was aware of the fact that this film would portray a not-so-good-side of Americans. But I was curious to see what it was that made Americans so-called 'bad'.What a disappointment! The 'badness' of Americans portrayed in this film, could have come from any nation or country. We are all humans and in this film I could only see what people in general are like.However, what shocked me was the blatant disrespect shown towards the people of Kazakhstan. I am from the Afrikaner group who are also often portrayed as backward and utterly stupid. Therefore I can sympathize with the Kazaks. This is not funny. It is prejudiced and unrealistic.",1,36,72,23 November 2006
Don Jon," The lack of human bonding
","I do not know much about the technicalities of film making, but I know a lot about what makes humans become what they are and I am often amazed about the insight writers and film makers display through excellent films like Don Jon. The lack of physical bonding between parents and their children younger than twelve, have tragic consequences for those children as adults. Don Jon exposes an example of such consequences: a deep feeling of isolation and an inability to belong to someone.It poses the question: What is a home? A place where people eat and watch a game?; or a place where people have sex?; or a place where people can safely be themselves?Then it also asks: What is a church?Turning away from the problem of failing families,the film presents answers that are real and achievable. One answer is that trying to get real help from professional therapists will not change one into the person one should be. The real answer lies in friendship, in touch, in trusting the other, in accepting another person completely - shortcomings and all. No therapy, just accepting life and the people close to you.",10,5,7,14 January 2014
