The Avengers," Fast Start, Slow Middle, Worth The Wait, Great Film!
","This is a well done comic book superhero film for everyone. Special effects, even in the 2D version are definitely worth the price of the admission ticket. We all thoroughly enjoyed the film. The film does get off to a good start and then it does slow down a bit to construct the plot and the character interaction to make it all work. But, when that is done, the film becomes a roller coater ride of special effects and action that is a treat to watch. Good Humor, Good Plot Build, Good Character Development, and Just Plain Well Done. The only reason we didn't give it a 10 is because we did not see the 3-D version and the slow build in the center (that, by the way is totally necessary) that makes the film worth seeing! Be SURE to see this while it's in the theaters! First film in a while that is worth every penny.",9,3,8,7 May 2012
