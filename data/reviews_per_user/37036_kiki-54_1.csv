Raiders of the Lost Ark," Indiana Jones goes in search of the Lost Ark.
","If I was to choose the greatest movies ever made,this would take first place.Professor Indiana Jones goes in search of the lost ark of the covenant,only to encounter some old colleges and some of the nastiest Nazis to goose-step on the face of the earth(cheers to Ronald Lacey's 'Toht').With remarkable stunts,casting,and villains,Raiders of the Lost Ark proves to be one of the most memorable films to boot.",Null,0,0,17 May 2000
