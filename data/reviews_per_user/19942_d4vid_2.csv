Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," childish, clumsy humour
","I agree to most critics in this page, and would just like to make one thing clear about the people who thought The Phantom Menace was better than the three earlier films. I can guarantee that one of the best films they´ve ever seen, is Men in Black.And the rest of us, who don´t like childish, clumsy humour performed by animated monsters, well, we have to wait and hope that Part II have a little more substance, and build up more 'alive' characters.",3,0,1,21 August 1999
The Truman Show," A good idea...
","..isnÂ´t always the same as a good film. In this case, a very good idea turns into an average hollywood production. I would like to call it WASTE OF GOOD IDEAS.",7,0,0,21 January 1999
