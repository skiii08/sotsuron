Scarface," Spectacular In Every Sense of the Word. A Classic.
","Scarface follows the story of Tony Montana (Al Pacino) as he rises from the gutter to become a millionaire drug lord kingpin in 1980's Miami. Come on, that's cool.
 *Here's Why It's Among The Best* 
-The performances are great, which makes things greater for the audience.
-The Cinematography is absolutely amazing, with spectacular action sequences and shots that make you feel invested in the story.
-Spot-on dialogue. There's no needless exposition nor extra b.s. for the sake of length, which is a nod from me :)
-A great villain. A villain which is presented as a more powerful ally, feels human and defeatable in every sense, but he's way richer, meaner and decides that the protagonist has become another loose end left to tie up.
-The Protagonist is someone you actually root for. We follow Tony as he endures hardship after hardship but he never gives up, no matter what. He's determined to conquer this city, his lust for power and money burns too big in comparison to what he's going through.
-The Violence is lovely! The blood and gore ain't too explicit or stylized, but it's gorgeous.
