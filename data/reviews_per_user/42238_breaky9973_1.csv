The Avengers," Solid but unsurprising super here movie.
","Luckily I saw this movie before I saw the rating on IMDb, or any other rating or review, as a matter of fact. Actually we were not planning to see this movie, but it was the best choice out of other average titles.Honestly I would give this movie a 6.5 on a scale of 10. The action is solid, but the story is not nothing to write home about.Basically it is your bad guy steals super-weapon, superhero(s) come together to fight bad guy and with some ups and downs there is the expected grand finale with lots of action story.The big problem is that there are a lot of characters in there so not everyone gets enough screen time. Personally I would have liked that Scarlett Johansson's character would have gotten more story.The rating at IMDb is thus inflated and should not be taken seriously. It is not though that I didn't enjoy the movie but for example, The Dark Knight is much better than this.",7,6,12,27 June 2012
