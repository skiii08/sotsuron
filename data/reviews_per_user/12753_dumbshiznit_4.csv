Requiem for a Dream," Very boring and overrated movie
","Personally I think too much has been made of this film. Many found it a disturbing and depressing depiction of drug addiction and it's consequences. Finally seeing it after much hype among friends, the only thing I found disturbing and depressing is that I was able to sit through this movie for almost 2 hours when I could have been scraping excess plaque from my teeth. I've seen more graphic depictions of drug abuse than this. It felt like a toned down documentary with a boring plot. The direction is mediocre at best, and the editing I found very choppy and annoying.As for the acting, once again, very mediocre and robotic. Maybe that was the tone set for the characters, but again I don't think these characters were a very tough job to bring to life.3/10",1,8,17,8 November 2001
American Beauty," What can I say about American Beauty that hasn't been said before?
","I can say that for me personally, it's an uplifting experience everytime I watch it. I don't often connect with movies on an emotional level but American Beauty is an exception. Aside from humor, the brutal truth about suburban life, and the interesting characters, I think many would be able to find a sense of hope and peace in their own lives if they can find a way to relate to Lester Burnham.The story sounds not entirely original. Set in a suburban neighborhood, Lester(Kevin Spacey) is bored, depressed, and sexually frustrated with his life. His job is going no where. His teenage daughter Jane(Thora Birch) despises him for one reason or another and refuses to bond. His perfectionist wife Carolyn(Annette Bening) rules the house with an iron fist. And as he realizes he has little to lose in life, he begins to live it how he sees fit, starting one night when he meets Jane's best friend Angela(Mena Suvari) and begins an unhealthy yet almost necessary lust for her. Angela is only a contributing character to Lester's new found desire to live life to the fullest, as Carolyn makes Lester realize what he doesn't want, Jane makes him realize what should be important, and new neighbor Ricky Fitts(Wes Bentley) brings back Lester's youth in a sense, and you see how Ricky himself is like a younger version of Lester. Ricky himself seems to express much of an artistic side, which at times seems exaggerated, but still in a way that you can enjoy it, and think about your own life. The most meaningful scene to me is towards the end, through out all of the suffering and pain, Angela asks Lester how he is doing, and Lester grins and realizes that he is doing well, and says he is great. This is a movie I watch whenever I need to feel better, and so far, it hasn't failed me yet. I haven't begun to describe this movie as far as the story goes, just what it expresses. It deserves at least a chance from everyone, so if you haven't seen it yet, give it a try.Perfect 10.",10,0,0,17 January 2002
Shrek," Despite all the talk and hype...
","... I still don't think ANY of it did this movie justice. I try to steer clear of repeated comments but this really is a movie that can be fun for all ages, and speaking from myself, any animation gurus out there can take note of this film as an animation classic. Don't be fooled by the television ads and commercials for Shrek though, it is not nearly as cartoony as they portray. It fits more into the surreal category if anything, mostly because of the great background and character rendering done with CGI. Generally speaking, I would have to say this is now my favorite computer animated movie so far, well above anything Disney has done. But aside from the technical stuff, it has a great plot that kids can love, funny moments, and adult humor here and there, where kids might not understand what is being said and that adults can laugh at like an inside joke. The spoofing of classic fairytales was funny, and the plot itself was simple(uptight king, save princess, fall in love with princess, happy ending) yet had enough originality to keep you interested. And out of all the crap that came out in 2001, this was a great, refreshing film.My only gripe being the marketing for this movie made me sadly overlook it for a few months, and that I was expecting Shrek to be some sort of 'friendly' ogre.It's a 9.5 out of 10",10,0,0,8 November 2001
Donnie Darko," dark, ugly, insane, and very very pretty
","I'm not quite sure if this movie had a point to it, but it was enjoyable nonetheless. Sort of a 'not shallow but still no diving at the pool' situation. It was an interesting experience to watch and I would recommend everyone check this one out on DVD when the time comes, since it was in such a limited release. Jake Gyllenhaal did a perfect job of portraying Donnie Darko, a character everyone refers to as a wierd teenager, but I viewed him as a rather normal down to earth being with typical teenager problems, but only with the rather strange ones that begin happening to him, as if god it-self picked him out to fix a paradox in space-time(yeah, just see the movie). For a writing/directing debut, the director of Donnie Darko made a damn fine effort, and I would expect even better results with future films.9/10",10,0,0,16 January 2002
