Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A Bloody Tale of Revenge, a pure Masterpiece
","Kill Bill (Vol. 1 and 2) is one of the best movies based on Revenge i have ever seen. volume 1 is the intense action, most of it is based on her telling you who her first 2 victims are, and how complicated it will be to reach one of them, the Queen of the Tokyo Underworld, O-ren ishii which is the big part of the beginning, the first half of the story. and it is violent. most of it so cartoonishly made, you can tell one person cannot do the things she does to the army of 4 dozen the 'Crazy 88's' and the blood that gushes is too much for one body to hold. so it isn't for the faint of heart, and whoever dislikes many body parts being taken off.Volume 2 had much more dialogue and was much better done, with more then one main battle, the Chapter called 'Elle and I' and the final chapter where you learn why the bride left, and what bill truly thought of the whole situation. it closes the HUGE gap that Vol. 1 left open.this one also has strong violence, only a couple scenes are really violent.This is one of the Greatest movies i have ever seen, and i hope it is your favorite too",Null,0,1,22 August 2004
The Girl Next Door," Well worth the money not an ordinary teen morth
","When I first heard of this movie i thought 'oh great another teen movie, like there aren't enough out' but then i got the chance to see it and was amazed by how, excuse the bad grammer, how Un-Teen movie like it was. after seeing that movie i was thoroughly shocked with how well done it was, it had more to it, not only was it a Dramedy (Drama/Comedy) but it was a big romance movie too, not as appropriate in ways, but it had everything for both sexes, it had the nudity and rough dialogue for guys, and the romance and slight drama to keep everyone happy, but fare warning, NOT A MOVIE TO WATCH WITH YOUR PARENTS! it is about PORN, there is a 10-15 scene where they are in a porn convention, and there is a scene at a strip club, and depending on if you are watching the rated or unrated version, there is nudity in the unrated one only, you see very little bare breast in that scene in the movie version. i loved this movie though, plenty of laughs, it is a little obvious from the beginning that there will be some teen movie clich√©s, but after that, it was amazing!",Null,0,0,7 September 2004
