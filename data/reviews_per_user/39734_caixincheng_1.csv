It," Scariest kids movie i've ever seen!
","Having started reading the novel after watching it in Singapore. Heard the 1990s mini series was many kids' nightmare but personally i find the remake even more thrilling, especially with better cg techs. Kids are real cute and awesome actors and actress. Can't wait to watch chapter 2.",10,2,3,26 September 2017
