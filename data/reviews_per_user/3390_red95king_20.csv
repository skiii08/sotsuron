Ali," Sounds to me like many of you weren't there...
","This was not an epic motion picture. And certainly some of the scenes between the boxing matches were boring, causing the film to drag. Some important elements are omitted from the story. Such as the second Frazier fight, what exactly influenced Ali to join Islam, and why he was broke after winning the heavy weight championship. Other elements were given undue importance, especially the intense focus on the prevailing civil rights battle during the period.That being said, the boxing match re-enactments were very well done. Great effort went into creating much of what actually transpired in those fights. And Will Smith's performance duplicated Ali's manner of speech and body language exactly. The supporting cast was adequate.Despite his flaws, Muhammad Ali was a folk hero. He single handedly turned the sport of boxing around. He backed up his talk by defeating stronger and more heavily favored opponents. The heavy weight division of professional boxing has been going down hill steadily ever since the Ali era ended. For boxing and/or Ali fans the movie is well worth viewing.",Null,0,0,12 July 2002
Meet the Parents," Over-hyped disappointment
","Hello all,Well I must say 'Meet the Parents' was a disappointment. Not very many laughs. Not nearly as funny as 'There's Something About Mary' (Ben Stiller), or 'Analyze This' (Di Niro). I'm a huge Di Niro fan, but even he couldn't save this one. Di Nero is funniest when he is doing a parody of himself, this material just wasn't right for him.  Stiller was ok, but once again a script that tries too hard for laughs just isn't funny.Forget this one and go rent the zero-budget 'Clerks' with an unknown cast - a much more ingenious comedy.",Null,1,2,30 April 2001
The Hustler," Over rated? Hardly.
","Some of the greatest acting performances of all time are to be found in this film. It is an acting clinic. Paul Newman as the driven pool hustler who dreams of being a pro, and in the process tosses aside the only person who ever cared about him. Piper Laurie who's incredible performance will leave your heart feeling as crushed as her own character's. George C. Scott as the granite-hearted money man, seeking to satisfy his need for action with no regard for those he may destroy on the way. And of course The Great One in an understated but superior performance as pool pro Minnesota Fats.The movie is bleak, shot in black and white making the dreary life of the pool hall dweller seem even more depressing. But Fast Eddie's  revelation in the final act ends things on somewhat of a high note.This movie is a classic. The acting is so good that I feel like I'm watching real life. If you enjoy the game of pool all the better.",Null,3,6,24 April 2001
The Terminator," What I liked better about 'The Terminator'
","(Don't get me wrong, I thought T2 was great.) 1) Arnold's character was much scarier in the first movie than Robert Patrick was in T2.2) The car chases/stunts were better.3) Linda Hamilton was much more feminine looking.4) Good sex scene.5) Better one-liners.6) Several now big-time actors seen early in their careers.7) I think T2 was geared more for kids.On top of that, I have a fond memory of viewing this film in an art house theater in 1985. Thanks for your indulgence.",Null,0,0,23 May 2001
We Were Soldiers," Somewhat cliched but reverent
",This look at the early U.S. involvement in Viet Nam is not perfect but I found it engrossing. With my fondness for war films I had a hard time sitting through the first third of the film which was entirely character development. I understand the importance - I just wanted the action to start. I wasn't disappointed. The battle scenes were well portrayed and intense. However the way the battle ended in the film is not historical. None the less the action is equal to the level of blood & guts elevated by movies like Saving Private Ryan.A quick note to my fellow posters overseas: If these American war films are so much flag waving patriotism to you guys - why keep watching them? This is a honorable look at men who had no idea what they were walking into. But they walked into it willingly to serve their country.,Null,0,0,23 August 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Better than Episode 1. Doesn't hold a candle to Ep 4/5/6
","My major problem with Star Wars Episode II (and Episode I for that matter) is that I don't really care about the characters. They are not nearly as vivid as Han Solo/Princess Lea/Luke etc. The characters seem two-dimensional, propped up by fantastic CGI effects. I will give Ewan McGregor credit however. He sounded like Alec Guinness which added continuity to the story. His performance was much improved compared to Episode I.Some aspects of the film were enjoyable to me. I thought Chris Lee was a great bad guy (as he always is). And his formidable command of the Force made the character even more intriguing. And it was nice to see Yoda put down his walking stick and kick some butt for a change. (However I do miss the muppet Yoda.)Episode II would be a great film if Episodes IV-VI were never made. As is stands the comparisons are inevitable. The film is well worth seeing in my opinion. But the quality of the saga itself has deteriorated.",Null,0,0,17 June 2002
Bridget Jones's Diary," Not for the men of the family
","Girl (who is supposed to be unappealing to men, but is not) gets boy, girl loses boy, girl gets boy, loses boy, finally gets boy - sheesh! (Well, it is a comedy but it just didn't work for me.)All the male characters are either obnoxious prats, gay, or spineless jellyfish. The film is rife with contrived and improbable scenes. Such as Bridget having dinner with her married friends, and the entire conversation centers around asking Bridget how her love life is, or pointing out that her biological clock is ticking, etc. The epilogue (which was deleted from the final cut of the film) is probably the funniest scene containing a self parody by Hugh Grant. (DVD version.)It's said that Renee` gained 25Lbs for the role. Interesting, it made her look normal. Rates 9 out of 10 on the 'Chick Flick' scale.",Null,0,0,19 November 2001
LÃ©on: The Professional," Director's cut is a completely different movie
","If you haven't seen the international version of 'Leon', you haven't seen the movie. The restored scenes (mainly depicting in far greater detail the relationship between Leon & Matilda) add much more dimension to what I would consider a pretty good action movie. Having already viewed 'The Professional' (as is was called in the States) several times before viewing the international version I was stunned. It's like two different movies. If anything Leon and Matilda's relationship is much more ambiguous in the U.S. cut. The additional scenes also give you more insight into the character of Leon, and his background.Look for the extended version of 'Leon', it's well worth viewing even if you have seen 'The Professional'.",Null,0,1,15 October 2001
The Thing," Ranks with Alien
","I recently obtained the Collector's Edition DVD after having seen this film in theaters and countless times on VHS. Still one of the best in the thriller/horror/SCI-FI genre, not quite as good as it's predecessor ALIEN but very close.The paranoia of the hapless research station staff is palpable. Enhanced by the claustrophobic surroundings of the station buildings and inclement polar weather outside. And in 1982 if the director wanted a special effect they actually had to BUILD it. No CGI here. To my mind the effects hold up well considering it was 2 decades ago. Thankfully a second-rate sequel was never made, preserving the impact of the thought provoking ending.THE THING is a classic. I recommend the DVD - wide screen being the only way to view John Carpenter's vision. An updated 'making of' documentary with cast/crew recollections is also quite interesting.",Null,1,2,20 May 2002
American Beauty," Over rated & predictable
","How in the world does this movie merit it's astronomically high ranking in the IMDB Top 250? I found this move quite insulting. This is just Hollywood's distorted and perverse view of middle (to upper-middle) class America. (Which is why the AMPAS loved it.) The characters are as shallow as cardboard cut-outs (Spacey his usual smart-ass self, Bening grates on you as the pain in the butt failure of a real estate agent.) and bear no resemblance to human beings real or imagined. This is a movie with an agenda. You (normal people) are bizarre. We (Hollywood) are normal. Sorry guys, I for one am not buying it.",Null,0,0,12 June 2001
The Fast and the Furious," The Moronic & Ridiculous
","This move was so dumb I don't even know where to begin. Put next to this, films 'Stone Cold', 'Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man', and 'Road House' look like cinematic masterpieces. If only it were true that you could roll a car 12 times at 100 miles per hour and come out with hardly a scratch. Granted there are some outstanding stunts, but not enough action overall to offset the non-sense plot and 3rd rate acting. Don't get me wrong I consider Vin Diesel a pretty good actor, but the script sounds like it was written for (or perhaps by) 8 year olds. Vin, your talents were wasted buddy. Watch 'Grand Prix' instead.",1,3,8,10 January 2002
The Butterfly Effect," Morbid, derivative but mildly interesting
","The ideas in this film are not new. In fact you can find elements of Groundhog Day, Its a Wonderful Life, even a Simpson's episode about a time travel machine in the form of a toaster. I suppose it all stems from Ray Bradbury's short story A Sound of Thunder. Go back in time step on a butterfly and vastly change the future. The problem with this film is that the 'butterfly' effect seems to apply only to the main character's inner circle. Not anyone else. Anyhow, the acting is pretty decent considering the characters have to go through all these different lives/timelines. But I found the movie over-long and incredibly morbid. I'm sure it appeals to Gen-X/Y'ers who may relate fully to the angst, depression and massive regret the story's characters embody.",Null,0,1,28 July 2004
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Not Kurasawa, but very good
","I enjoyed this film very much. The visuals were stunning, the action scenes were great fun, and the music was superb. Many here have complained about the plot/story line as being thin or disjointed. Or that the acting was bad. Ok, let's say for a moment that's true. Why would anyone watch a martial arts movie? Why did I watch this movie? For the fighting. Watching a martial arts movie is like watching a musical. All the time you're waiting for the next song. All the while I was waiting for the next fight scene. I'd also like to point out that combatants have been 'flying' around in Kung Fu movies for many years. If you happen to be a fan of the genre you would know that. The American version of the trailer clearly depicted this film as a martial arts movie. If you're not a fan of martial arts, why would you watch this movie in the first place?",Null,0,0,20 June 2001
Mulholland Drive," I have a different take...
","**POSSIBLE SPOILER(S)**This film was Lynch all the way. Spooky and strange. However I enjoyed the viewing. Obviously out of chronological order much like a Tarantino film. Many have stated the plot to be part dream/nightmare, part reality. I believe the first half of the movie takes place after both women are dead. (One suicide, one murdered.) Diane's afterlife - where they meet as ideal lovers. One of them with amnesia the other a wholesome girl next door type. Adding to the ideal for Diane is her success in being cast on the big screen (as Betty). Which was her dream in life. The second half of the film depicts events leading up to that point - Camilla dumps Diane, Diane in her rage hires a hit-man to kill Camilla etc.Can't say I'm much of a David Lynch fan. Not a bad film though.",Null,0,0,13 May 2002
The Piano," Feminist dreck
","All the men in this film are depicted as neglectful, abusive and brutal. While the women are hapless victims (with the exception of the natives). And what was with the music? The piano pieces were reminiscent of a new age Windham Hill artist, not 19th century.Definitely sensual. But the ending would have been better if the opposite had happened. Rates 9 out of 10 on the 'Chick Flick' scale.",Null,4,8,14 August 2001
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Just awful
","'Natural Born Killers' meets 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'How is this in the IMDB top 250? Oh...never mind...all the under 18 year olds voted 10.0 looks like.Now that Q.T. can make whatever movie he wants he pukes this out. Nothing but self indulgent tripe. And enough with the close-ups of Uma's ugly toes ok Quentin? Thanks.I'm a fan of classic samurai and kung fu theater with lots of wire work but the fighting in this (with few exceptions) is terrible. I won't go into details but see if you can find a classic samurai flick like 'Sword of Doom' and compare the action.",Null,1,2,29 April 2004
Black Hawk Down," At least read the book before you pass judgement
","This film is very well done and follows the book faithfully (although some of the more shocking details were omitted from the movie).I noticed most of the negative posts were from people outside the US. Perhaps you guys should stop watching American made war films. (They're not directed at you anyway.)These events really happened, but were not highly publicized at the time for political reasons. The film does not explore the politics of US involvement in Somalia. It depicts one disastrous event that occurred during that period. And yes, it was a disaster for both sides.Not for the faint of heart, this movie is quite graphic. And despite the complaints from other posters about lack of character development, I felt pain and sadness watching the depiction of our young men bleeding to death on screen.This film (and the book it is based on) increased my respect (which was already tremendous) for the American men & women who sacrifice all to protect our Freedom. It is well worth viewing.",Null,0,0,30 January 2002
Enemy at the Gates," A Bore from the gate
","Hello all,Having read the book 'War of the Rats' I was excited to see the trailer on TV which was obviously a theatrical version of the same story.However, the film's depiction of the sniper encounters had none of the tension or intrigue of the book. And the heavy propaganda plot line was tedious and tiresome. Granted, the sniper showdown was likely a Soviet propaganda ploy, but it carried too much weight here in my opinion.Many have complained here about the British accents, so I won't belabor that point. Except to say it cheapened the experience for me somewhat.Ed Harris was a bright spot. But for me this ranks toward the bottom of the list in the WWII genre.",Null,1,2,2 April 2001
Jurassic Park," What's with the shotguns?
","Hello all,Now that the second sequel to 'Jurassic Park' is due out this summer, I feel compelled to make a point. Having read Crichton's novel beforehand, I then saw this movie in theaters in '93 and was disappointed. In the book the park-keepers had no weapons. (Except cattle prods, which are not weapons really.) John Hammond wouldn't allow weapons within park boundaries. To me that was a major point of the story. No weapons means your screwed.As soon as I saw that first shotgun being wielded it was over for me.",Null,0,2,11 May 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Not bad, but not Raising Arizona
","This film is somewhat disjointed and lacking the strong thread of a narrative (which I'll admit isn't always needed). However it certainly had its moments.Turning the KKK into something from Oz was pretty funny. And the Bluegrass tunes were fun (including George Clooney's hilarious jig in one of the latter scenes).But in my opinion the effort doesn't hold a candle to prior Coen brothers works. Especially 'Raising Arizona' or 'Fargo'. In the end 'Oh Brother' strikes me as a string of exceedingly clever scenes only loosely bound together - with a number of Coen brother regulars tacked on for good measure (i.e. John Goodman, Holly Hunter). But it was fun none the less.",Null,0,0,2 July 2001
