Deja Vu," Enough time traveling movies already
","This movie is mildly entertaining. But seriously, I can't take any more time traveling movies. I mean, time travel simply doesn't make sense. If I could travel back in time, last thing in my mind would be solving crime, I'll be busy buying lottery tickets with the winning numbers. I'm sorry that I'm no saint but common, I think movies should be somewhat believable to be fun.And, what a politically correct yet absurd choice of villain: white American terrorist!!!!! Common, gimme a break. Everyone (except liberals who are determined not to admit the truth) knows typical terrorists are the bearded, middle eastern men with diapers on their heads. Who are we kidding here? Why can't people make movies with characters that even remotely reflects reality.Well, enough ranting.",5,0,2,12 August 2007
