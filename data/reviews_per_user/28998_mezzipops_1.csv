Vertigo," Hitchcock takes the art of film making to new heights.
","This Hitchcock thriller made in the 50's is one of the best films I believe he ever made. Wonderful performances from James Stewart as the man obsessively in love with the very beautiful and mysterious Kim Novak. Superb supporting cast including the late Barbara Bel Geddes. Hermann's theme gives a three dimensional feel to this movie with his haunting melody. This film has been lovingly restored to it's original beauty. I bought this DVD fairly recently and it has the bonus of having a lot of information about how the film was made and restored.If you enjoy Hitch then you will love this classic, go and buy it. Rating: EXCELLENT. Hitchcock isn't just a name, it's another word for GENIUS! From Meryl Heasman (songwriter) CATFLAP MUSIC.",10,2,3,26 April 2006
