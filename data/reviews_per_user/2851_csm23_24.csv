Minority Report," Free Will and Preforeordestination, as Huck Finn used to say: a real corker
","Steven Spielberg excels at directing thrill rides like Jaws and Close Encounters.  Lately, though, it seems he's been trying to fluff up his directorial resume with more substantive productions.  More often than not, he seems to be in over his head.  Minority Report, while visually entertaining  chock full of technical eye candy  is a curious mixture of the inimitable Spielberg style with a substantive issue.  This time, he set his target on the problem of human `free will.'  The issue of `free will' is one hell of a good theme.  There's a prismatic array of perspectives on the idea, a topic of serious argument for centuries.  Erasmus and Luther, for example, had a rollicking good fight over it.  But when they angrily smashed their hammers on the anvil of the subject, the sparks that flew up produced both the `Diatribes' and `Bondage of the Will,' works of lasting importance.  And people like Emerson, rebelling against the Calvinist belief in free will as the puppet strings of God, claimed god-like autonomy when he boldly declared to the world, `I make my own circumstances.'  And then behaviorists like Skinner and Watson sneered at `free will' as a childish fantasy similar to the ignorant Russian peasant's belief that the steam engine had an animating `spirit.'  And this isn't even the tip of the iceberg.  But Spielberg  well, he likes to simplify things to the point of being just plain goofy.  The `pre-cogs' in this story are brain-damaged people who can see future murders.  Their precognition is a `gift,' a natural compensation for their other mental deficiencies.  OK, I can buy that.  But here's the rub:  they are never wrong, but occasionally they `disagree.'  Errrr, uuuuh, like, What??  Either they're never wrong, or they're occasionally wrong, but not both.  And this absurdity is the mental linchpin of the entire movie.  I mean, How could anyone miss it?  It's not even presented as a paradox, like the `liar's paradox' that logicians think is so clever.  Discrepancies like this run through the entire length of the movie, and eventually make one's head hurt.  But, if you like action, it ain't bad.",Null,0,0,7 March 2003
Training Day," The Art of Seduction
","Seduction.  It's such an interesting subject.  Kierkegaard used to say that it is a necessary part of religious conversion.  And Kuhn used to say that conversion is an essential part of every scientific revolution.  Would the world go round without it?  I love Training Day precisely because it's such a visceral foray into the art of seduction;  for example, when Jake, the trainee, is faced with a serious moral dilemma, Alonzo tells him that the game they're playing is chess, not checkers, and adds, with avuncular affection, that when he's able to match what's going on in his head with the `real world,' he'll feel better.  Only after he knows how to play the game, Alonzo adds, after he has become `wise' to real world, can he change things for the better.  But he must become part of the system, however corrupt, before he can change it. He must have some dirt on him before others can trust him.  From a pragmatist perspective, this is reasonable.  From a `strategic' perspective of a chess match, it's morally superior.  `They build jails because of me,' Alonzo boasts.  And so, when the rookie makes his choice to challenge Alonzo's `official' construction of reality with that of his own, he's really challenging the entire system.  In the eyes of his peers, he's an egoist, a `choir boy' who's better suited for a different line of work.  He's a threat, not because he's ethically superior to his colleagues, but because he just doesn't understand the fundamental realities of the situation.  `It's not what you know:  it's what you can prove,' Alonzo says several times over to his protégé.  Alonzo has the social and political capital to `prove' anything he likes.  The more times I see the video, the more I buy into Alonzo's perspective. And the more I wonder if he wasn't right after all.  The game is chess, not checkers.  Watch it again and see if you don't notice a subtle change in your attitude.",Null,0,11,7 March 2003
Unbreakable," The power of opposites
","`Real life doesn't fit into little boxes that were drawn for it,' says Elijah Price, the villain, to David Dunn, the hero.  And yet, in a different part of the movie, Elijah also says  `Comics are our last link to an ancient way of passing on history.'  These two statements seem incompatible;  but, they're not:  Comic book images resemble the simplified depictions of reality that appear in consciousness, but they are not snapshots of the reality itself.  They point to something true, though the renderings themselves are not.  I find the comic book theme of Unbreakable to be absolutely enchanting and irresistible.  I love this sort of movie:  it's substantive, original, yet completely familiar -- a comic book story set to film.  It proceeds at a slow pace, the way a serious comic book aficionado turns the pages, slowly and carefully, alert to every nuance of meaning that can be gleaned from the amplified scarcity of the sketches and the terse prose.  Every spoken word, though prosaic, comes forth layered with meaning, like a Hemingway novel. The images are oversimplified, drawing attention to the one point of a scene carries the full weight of the story's intention, like the vivid colors of the evil malefactors set against a dull gray background. 
And the good versus evil theme, intentionally based on the physics of polarity, invests the stylized images with unfeigned power.  An electrical potential is increased when one side of a circuit has a deficiency of electrons, while the other side has a surplus.  The greater the imbalance, the higher the voltage.   Weather systems gain strength when there is a disparity of hot and cold, wet and dry.  The greater the imbalance, the more powerful the system.  And so it is with Elijah and David, both of whom represent the internal polarities of good and evil.  The exaggerated imbalance between them, `opposite ends of the same curve,' as Elijah put it, is quietly, but utterly, engaging.",Null,0,0,18 May 2002
Fight Club," Soap for the soul
","There are movies that tell a great story, and movies that are fun to watch; and then, there are totally transcendent films that give the viewer a distinct out-of-body experience.  It's these sorts of films that carry the filmmaking industry into what Joseph Campbell might call creative mythology. They tap deep currents in the collective unconscious, and let us leave the theater with a new level of self-awareness.  Fight Club is, without doubt, a great movie of this ilk.  It's brilliant.  Fight Club cuts to the very core of the contemporary male's struggle to pass into adulthood without the aid of initiation rituals.  It shows what we have lost, and what we might possibly gain, from traditional societies and their seemingly brutal rites of passage.  Fight Club follows the life of your typical young urban professional, spiritually etiolated from his pursuit of career, designer clothes, and the right circle of friends.  Inside, he's dead, cut off from his primal instincts, which he has totally lost by virtue of his complete socialization into the norms of American commercial culture.  And yet, as he comes to grips with that part of himself that he attempted to destroy -- his true, mythical self -- he creates an initiation rite and ritual, which isn't an awkward, slavish copy of other cultures.  It's right for himself, and his peculiar little society.  It works.  One might think that the fighting in Fight Club is about dominance and brutality.  It isn't.  It's about discovering one's limitations, and learning humility.  In some traditional cultures, men can't become warriors until they've first learned to dance.  The Fight Club initiation is about learning how to dance.  It's brutal, but it's also compassionate.  It's soap for the soul.  Although the destructive ending is meant to be understood allegorically, and not literally, you'll love this movie.",Null,0,1,17 May 2002
The Others," What happens when the cork's in too tight
","The Others is not a typical horror flick.  Instead of scaring us with the dark deeds of Lucifer and his minions, as is typical, it takes us into the personal hell of a devout believer, who has managed to create her own damnation out of the very fabric of her religion and faith.  And it's so effective because we've all known people like that.  Some of us can identify with her, having lived life in a similar religious hell.  It's a gripping story about someone who thinks of her supreme being as an angry, vindictive old bastard. She creates her personal reality out of this fundamental, unexamined assumption.  The main character's name, Grace, is a beautiful irony:  she has no grace with herself, or others, which is, ostensibly, the essence of her faith.Adroitly played by Nicole Kidman, Grace is a woman oppressed by religiously induced fantasies about what should and shouldn't be, to the extent that, when it isn't so, which is most of the time, her pious aspect shows its righteous and terrible wrath.  She's a `pocket' angry deity, a miniature Jesus of the book of Revelation, p***ed off, with a sword and a big white horse and eyes blazing and just itching to raise whoop-jamboreehoo against the ungodly.  Though a clever woman, her mental abilities lie dormant on the fallow ground of `thou shalts' and `thou shalt nots,' which she uncritically absorbs from her blessed catechisms.  Not only does she torment herself with externally derived notions of personal perfection, but she persecutes everyone else with her anally conscientious moral rectitude.  If she showed up at your office cocktail party, you'd probably find yourself on the opposite side of the room.  She just has the cork in way too tight.We ask ourselves throughout the film, `What's with this obsession?'  And then we find out with the movie's surprise ending, which, I confess, caught me like a good left hook.  Wham.  Right on the chin.  It's a very clever variation on an old theme.",Null,0,0,31 May 2002
Insomnia," An Anemic Remake
","I don't know why Christopher Nolan bothered to do a remake of the original Insomnia, a Norwegian film about a morally ambivalent investigating detective, whose pragmatism made him an effective investigator, but also a little unprincipled.  Brilliantly portrayed by Jonas Engström, the Norse version draws the viewer into the ethical relativism of the esteemed sleuth. It's a riveting performance.On the trail of a child murderer, he makes a mistake, shooting his partner, friend, and long-time colleague by accident while chasing the killer in a thick fog.  None of the police witnessed it, so he covers it up by saying that the killer did it.  One can understand the reasoning:  it was an honest mistake;  and, the murderer is ultimately responsible, anyway.  The detective creates a cover story for one simple reason:  he's embarrassed. He could have easily told the truth, and it probably wouldn't have harmed him;  but, in a moment of panic and discomposure, he lies, creating a plausible cover story, making it more difficult with every succeeding lie to come clean.  It's believable.  Not knowing that the accidental homicide was witnessed by the murderer, the tangled web he weaves starts becoming his own personal spider web, himself the captured fly.The American version, by contrast, is much less interesting.  Why? There's no moral ambivalence.  In the American version, Will Dormer's moral dilemma is the same old crap about ends justifying the means.  It's like taking a melody played gently on a flute, and blaring it out all gaudy and loud on a mighty Wurlitzer.  It's not as convincing as the original film, because it moral subtlety that made the original so compelling.  We sit there and say, `that's wrong,' instead of sitting on the edge of our seats and saying, `it may be wrong, but it's understandable.'  The ethical pragmatism of the investigating detective in the original is what gave it its edge, its grit, its dramatic tension, its cachet.  Toward the end of the remake, I started to feel as drowsy as the sleepless detective.If you want to see Insomnia, rent the original version, not its eviscerated copy.",Null,1,2,7 March 2003
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Kubric's Apocalyptic Vision Proves Prophetic: The Uncanny Similarities between Jack D. Ripper and Dubya
","Colonel Jack D. Ripper has a problem:  in the act of lovemaking, he experiences what he calls a `loss of essence.'  It troubles him, as it would any man, so he sets out to find the reason.  An observant and intuitive man, he notes that Russians never drink water, and that the fluoridation of water began in 1946, right about the time when the American and Soviet allies had their noisy falling out that ushered in the Cold War.  A natural born scientist, he decides to test his hypothesis that fluoridation of water had contaminated his purity of essence by drinking only pure grain alcohol and rainwater.  When his `essence' returns, he alone understands the enormity of the evil threat;  so, he orders a massive airborne nuclear assault against the Soviets in defense of our god given purity of essence. 
I know what you're thinking:  Kubrick's apocalyptic imagination is entertaining, but unreal.  Or is it?  Consider this:  it wasn't long after our president got a carpet burn on his forehead while privately gnawing a pretzel in the quiet serenity of the White House that he formulated is `axis of evil' foreign policy.   Hmmmm.  It makes me wonder if there isn't a connection between this event, similar in many respects to Colonel Ripper's loss of `essence,' and the president's comic book analysis of the world, complete with villains, super villains, and the Almighty's own sword of justice, which, by the way, always takes the shape of the US military. 
You see what I mean.  Kubrick was right on target with his prescient foray into the realm of chaos theory, where a chain of freak events can lead to world chaos.  So, for goodness sake, if you haven't seen the movie, which is pregnant with meaning as regards our current situation with that camel-fornicator from Iraq, crazy as old Nebuchadneezer, you've got to see it now.  It's your patriotic duty.",Null,0,0,7 March 2003
Bridget Jones's Diary," A woman in search of intimacy finds herself
","I checked out this movie with suspicious, squinted little snake eyes, intrigued by all the hype, but on the lookout for gushy sentiment and romantic drivel.  Boy, was I surprised.  Bridget Jones is a 32-year-old, single, working woman, who has decided to trade some of her independence for a romantic relationship.  She's thinking marriage. Her difficulties arise from the fact that, while she's charming, attractive, spontaneous, trusting, and perfectly sincere, she's not terribly bright.  As she enters this new stage of her life, she begins to journal about it. Ms. Jones narrates the film in the third person, as if audibly writing in her diary, a great way to get inside the personal struggles of the heroine.
Basically, in the course of her personal quest for a relationship, she's confronted with a choice between `intensity' and `intimacy,' the one offering danger and excitement, the other safety and excitement.  They look alike, but they're not.  The first type of relationship is your typical `cosmic' romance, in which some poor dumb idiot is always looking for a `soul mate,' who is always disappointed that nobody is perfect enough.  This person is usually codependent.  The second type of relationship, while less dangerous (it's a peculiarity of the human psyche that people are more sexually attractive to us when we associate them with danger), offers warmth, acceptance, mutual individuation, and self-expression.  It's the joy of intimacy based upon clear-eyed acceptance of each other's strengths and faults.  There's a great scene in the video, where Bridget throws a dinner party for her friends.  She's a horrible cook, and the meal is, by all accounts, hard to swallow.  In a jocular mood, her friends argue over which of several courses was the worst.  But it's not malicious.  It's the kind of jesting that is totally affirming, that fully accepts Ms. Jones in spite of, and maybe also because of, her shortcomings.  Now that's intimacy.",Null,1,1,18 May 2002
The Bourne Identity," Self Knowledge as 'Remembering:' A Platonic Dialogue Continues
","A question I must answer, every single day of my life, is the most fundamental of all:  Who am I?  Am I the product of my environment, whether good or bad?  Am I defined by what I do?  Am I synonymous with my job?  Is my personality, my very sense of self, God's own caricature, written long ago in the stars and etched in the palm of my hands?  Or, Do I have the willpower to choose who I am?  Can I say who I am without reference to my past, or my occupation?  Matt Damon's character, Jason Bourne, is a man who is faced with exactly this challenge, which is what makes The Bourne Identity inherently compelling.  While watching Jason's attempt to discover himself, to find out who he is, I sit and share his inner trepidation, for one reason:  when he discovers his social identity, Will it be compatible with his natural, instinctive self, the self that has come to him from a near death experience like a second birth?  Or, Will he find out that he's gone off the rails somewhere along the way?  Will he find out that the choices he's made, the life and occupation he's chosen for himself, is in alignment with his uncluttered self?  I identify with the main character because I'm forced to ask myself the same questions.  Is all this stuff I use to describe myself, my personal history, my talents, who I really am?  Does my personal history really reflect my deepest values?  Am I living an authentic life? 
This is interesting stuff, a compelling reification of Socrates's idea of learning as `recollection.'  The main character discovers, as does the audience, that his past life is an identity, a cover story, and not the true Jason Bourne.  It's as if he's playing `What's My Line,' and he's all three contestants.  In this film, Bourne is a hero of self-discovery, and not some idiotic `James Bond' type who can't distinguish his penis from his gun.",Null,0,1,7 March 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A true fairy tale
","Back when the Academy was preparing to award their coveted prize of best movie of the year, I wanted to see the Lord of the Rings win out against a number of very strong contenders.  I knew it didn't have a chance, though, for one simple reason:  it's a fairy tale;  and, the Academy would never consider a fairy tale as being substantive enough to receive its highest honor.  But that's where they're wrong:  fairy tales are amongst the greatest achievements of the human spirit.  They are, in many respects, pure spirit.  The Lord of the Rings is not only drenched in mythic symbolism, it is a modern myth of the highest order.  The central theme of the film (as in the book) is the problem power:  its corrupting and destructive influence on human character, and our common lust after it.  If we're honest with ourselves, we all believe that, given absolute power, we would use it justly and honorably.  And that's where we would be tragically wrong.  We all identify with Frodo when he suggests that Bilbo should have killed Gollum when he had the chance.  We can see ourselves expressing that sentiment.  In context, it seems reasonable.  But in the fairy tale flow of the story, our aggressive instincts are mirrored back for us when Gandalf replies, `Do not be too eager to deal out death and destructionÂ…  The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of men.'  This silly little fairy tale puts forth about as relevant a theme to modern society as any I can imagine.  This is serious stuff.  And it's beautifully done. 
Best of all, true to the spirit of Tolkien's work, this film renders the essence of Tolkien's tale with utter faithfulness to the original story. The casting, costumes, and settings, an adroit mixture of real people and places and special effects, are amazingly accurate.  I am so looking forward to the following sequels.",Null,0,0,9 September 2002
Doctor Zhivago," One of the Best Epic Films Ever Made
","I can't remember the origin of the quote, but I remember it distinctly.  A Communist Party official of the Soviet Union, justifying the Bolshevik destruction of Tsarist Russia, told a foreign observer, `If you want to make an omelet, you've got to break some eggs.'  The visitor replied, `I see the broken eggs, but Where's the omelet?'  Dr. Zhivago is set at the time when the Bolsheviks, feverishly ideological, were creating their socialist state. The epochal drama that unfolds is the age-old question about whether the ends justify the means.  As materialists (matter precedes spirit, not vice versa), the Bolsheviks believed that they had found the holy grail of human progress in Marxism-Leninism, and were now able to assume the reins of history in their own hands.  They believed that their violence was not only justified, but necessary, oblivious to the fact that they, too, somehow felt the angel of medieval teleology smiling over their shoulders.  In contrast to the Bolsheviks, Zhivago's ethos, if he had one, was almost identical to Kant's `categorical imperative,' which had just one axiom: treat people as ends in themselves, and not as ends to a mean.  There couldn't be a sharper moral contrast.  There's a fabulous scene midway through the movie that highlights the difference in moral attitude.  Dr. Zhivago confronts a communist functionary who has ordered the destruction of a village, a hamlet suspected of aiding the Mensheviks by selling them horses.  To the Bolsheviks, if you weren't 100 percent behind them, you were a `counterrevolutionary,' sorta like Dubya's idea that you're either for us, or against us.  And so Strelnikov, the passionate Bolshevik, glibly justifies his actions to Dr. Zhivago as easy as if he were tossing his hair aside, saying that the annihilation of the village, however cruel, is necessary to make a point.  Zhivago replies: `Your point;  their village.'  I love this film, a timeless epic.  If there's a more beautiful heroine in all of movie-making history than Julie Christie (Lara), I'm not aware of it. And Omar Sharif is stunning as Iuri Zhivago, who heals the body with emetics, scalpels, antiseptic, and gauze, while he heals the soul with his poetry.  Although the movie is three hours and 20 minutes long, the cinematography is so efficient, evocative, and densely layered that one hardly notices.  This is, in my opinion, one of the best films of all time.",Null,138,185,7 March 2003
American Beauty," Babbitts Everywhere
","Midlife crisis:  it's something we've come to expect from middle-aged men. And we've all seen the stereotypical manifestations:  a `normal' guy goes out and buys a Harley, or has an affair, or just becomes a royal jackass around the house - more so than usual, that is.  It's so damned clichÃ©.American Beauty transcends the plethora of hackneyed truisms about midlife crisis for one reason:  it deals with the social and cultural forces that produce it, and not just the dramatic changes that come midway through life, changes that Jung insisted are inevitable.  The difference between American Beauty's Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) and Married with Children's Al Bundy is the difference between Dante's middle aged man who, awakened, enters a deep, `dark wood,' the creative and spiritual side of life (not without it's perils!), and Sinclair Lewis's `Babbitt,' who boasted that he had never done anything he wanted to do.  It's the difference between following one's bliss, and stashing one's life on a shelf until the balance of years expires.  It's brilliant because when Lester Burnham, who used to be a Babbitt, reforms his Babbitt-like ways, he pisses off all the other Babbitts, especially his wife and next door neighbors, the `Fitts.'  With Babbitts everywhere to be found, it's not a wonder that a midlife crisis is necessary.  It is a wonder that anyone succeeds in finding the dark wood, and not an ersatz experience, like the herds of men with leather jackets and Harleys.What's more, the conflict between Lester Burnham and everyone else is not only pithy social satire, it's outrageously comical.  Anette Bening is simply brilliant as Lester's wife, who is anal, materialistic, and completely fanatical about financial success.  (She was robbed of the Academy Award in 1999, I think.)  Her daughter's phony friend spots her immediately as a phony (takes one to know one), as she effuses fake good cheer and beneficence.  I've worked with people like that.  Let me tell you, they can kill your spirit.  They can make you sick.If you haven't seen it, rent it.",Null,0,0,9 March 2003
Apocalypse Now," Our very own American sacrificial god
","Toward the end of this epic story, which simply breathes of the acid-laced consciousness of the sixties, one thing in particular caught my eye:  in Colonel Kurtz's private collection of books, he has the Bible on a shelf, while James Frazer's The Golden Bough sits out as having recently been read. Both books deal with death and resurrection.  The Golden Bough, however, is a profound ethnographic study of the subject.  As Frazer put it, `The killing of the god is a necessary step to his revival or resurrection in a better form.  Far from being an extinction of the divine spirit, it is only the beginning of a purer and stronger manifestation of it.' 
Colonel Kurtz is obviously synonymous with the ancient `King of the Wood,' the protector of the Golden Bough, a living incarnation of the tree-spirit, who sends rain and sunshine, made crops to grow, women conceive, and herds multiply.  He is a god.  We hear testimonies of his divinity both from his enemies and his followers.  Which is why this movie is so fascinating.  In this film, Coppola invests the inevitable murder of the god-king with new meaning:  the assassination of Colonel Kurtz is the symbolic sacrifice of the shadow side of the American character, the dark side of America's cheery optimism about making the world safe for democracy, the hidden aggression behind the beautiful rhetoric.  In many ritual sacrifices, the god-king is actually eaten by his worshippers.  Kurtz obviously understands himself this way, as he tells the Captain, whom Kurtz accepts as his executioner, that he's neither an assassin nor a soldier, but `an errand boy, sent by the grocery clerks to collect a bill.'  As he says this, he strokes his shiny bald head, luminescent against the dark background, oblong and fertile like a giant egg, ready to burst forth with new life.  Kurtz tells the Captain, as he prepares himself for the sacrifice, that he has the right to kill him, but not judge him.  This film is eminently worth watching now that we are again on the warpath against evil.  It warns us to pay attention, first and foremost, to the evil that lies within ourselves.",Null,0,0,18 May 2002
Black Hawk Down," Tribute to soldiers, not war
","The first time the Spartans lost a land battle, they were defeated by a small city with an elite force of 300 men called the `Sacred Band.'  The edge of the wedge, the Sacred Band crushed a Spartan phalanx 12-deep, stronger than the legendary Spartan group who held the pass at Thermopylae against the Persian hordes.  Each of the 300 was bound to one other by a sacred oath of mutual protection.  Like Jonathan and David, their mutual love and respect for each other were only broken by death. 
Blackhawk Down is about this type of loyalty, the sacred bond between soldiers.  War in general, and the conflict between the US and General Aidid in particular, are the movie's background.  In the foreground stand the soldiers themselves.  Blackhawk Down fits you into the battle fatigues of the Army Rangers. Before going out on their mission, we feel the nervous energy of the men, who relieve their stress by joking around, or by prancing and farting and strutting like brewery horses in bock-beer time.  As they leave base to battle, heading toward the uncertainty of their fate, the hypnotizing pulse of the helicopter, together with the funk of fear, induce distortions of sound and vision, the nauseous feeling of adrenaline overload.  When the Blackhawk helicopter goes down, and the people of Mogadishu recognize their opportunity to shovel up hell, we actually feel the calm focus of training and instinct one feels when the fight is finally on.  More than that, we feel what a soldier means when he says that `It's all bout the man next to you.  And that's all it is.'  Leaving aside larger issues about the moral justification of one side against the other, Blackhawk Down pins the red badge of courage on all the combatants.  There are poignant scenes of death and destruction on both sides of the conflict.  They all operate under the color of separate beliefs and ideologies; and, they're all tragic victims of circumstance. 
This film is a tribute to the courage and selflessness of soldiers, not war.",Null,0,1,9 September 2002
The Insider," The Bill of Rights and 'Prior Restraint:' The Tobacco Companies as Censors
","Back when good old James Madison was thinking and ciphering and scribbling up the Bill of Rights, the phrase `freedom of the press' had a specific meaning:  freedom from `prior restraint,' which meant that publishers no longer had to submit their articles to a board of censors for approval before going to press.  To the censors, just because something was true didn't mean it would be approved;  on the contrary, the truer something was, the more dangerous it could have been as an instrument of sedition and insurrection.  What an irony, then, that 200 years after the ratification of the Bill of Rights, the tobacco companies have the power, and authority, to exercise `prior restraint' censorship on matters of fundamental and vital interest to the public welfare.  It's as if the tobacco industry has become the pre-Revolutionary equivalent of an oppressive board of censors.  I suspicion that it would have made Madison's blood boil.  Ain't that a corker?Not since All the President's Men has such a significant, insightful, beautifully presented and dramatically poignant documentary film  an embellished but basically true tragedy of epic Greek proportions  been released.  On the one side, you have Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), a producer for CBS's `60 Minutes,' whose mission is to communicate vital information to an informed, voting populace.  On the other, there is Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), a former tobacco executive, who faces a monumental moral dilemma:  on the one hand, he knows the dirty secrets of the tobacco industry, and deeply feels his duty to expose them;  on the other hand, he is bound by his confidentiality agreement with Brown and Williamson, which he also feels duty bound to honor.  Worse yet, Wigand faces an array of profoundly negative personal consequences if he decides to go public. Needless to say, no one would blame him if he decided to protect himself and keep quiet.  But to talk, well, that's as valorous a deed as ever accomplished on a field of battle.  This is a true `must see' video.",Null,1,2,7 March 2003
Eyes Wide Shut," Sex and affection: can they be successfully combined?
","In Greek mythology, Zeus allegedly got into an argument with his wife, Hera, over which gender was more sexual, male or female;  so, he took a god and changed his sex, and then asked for a comparison.  Zeus wasn't happy with the answer:  the female of the species, the god reported, far surpassed the male, both in terms of desire, and ability.  Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut is narrowly focused on this issue of female sexuality.  In fact, its laser-beam dedication to the issue of feminine sexual desire is so unwavering that it's easy to be confused by its obsessive single-mindedness.  Although most of the movie's action follows Bill (Tom Cruise) as he struggles with jealousy over his wife's attraction to other men, it's really about her:  Alice (Nicole Kidman) literally defines his reality through her own.  And her reality is produced, not by her conscious will, but by the depths of her feminine sexuality, buried so deeply and so powerfully within the libidinous pre-conscious brain that her waking awareness is but a shadow image of it.Bill's world is thrown into chaos when, high on pot, Alice's true nature comes smashing through her darkest depths to the light of consciousness. Discussing infidelity, he tells her that he's never been jealous of her because she `would never be unfaithful.'  She replies, sarcastically, `You're awfully sure of yourself, aren't you?'  Bill answers, confidently, `No, I'm sure of you.'  As a man, I feel the object ownership inherent in Bill's words.  And then Alice destroys Bill's somnambulistic, fragile, secure, culturally accepted and encouraged little lie, baring her lustful soul to him with a true confession.

Eyes Wide Shut," The inner conflicts of feminine sexuality
","In Greek mythology, Zeus allegedly got into an argument with his wife, Hera, over which gender was more sexual, male or female;  so, he took a god and changed his sex, and then asked for a comparison.  Zeus wasn't happy with the answer:  the female of the species, the god reported, far surpassed the male, both in terms of desire, and ability.  Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut is narrowly focused on this issue of female sexuality.  In fact, its laser-beam dedication to the issue of feminine sexual desire is so unwavering that it's easy to be confused by its obsessive single-mindedness.  Although most of the movie's action follows Bill (Tom Cruise) as he struggles with jealousy over his wife's attraction to other men, it's really about her:  Alice (Nicole Kidman) literally defines his reality through her own.  And her reality is produced, not by her conscious will, but by the depths of her feminine sexuality, buried so deeply and so powerfully within the libidinous pre-conscious brain that her waking awareness is but a shadow image of it.Bill's world is thrown into chaos when, high on pot, Alice's true nature comes smashing through her darkest depths to the light of consciousness. Discussing infidelity, he tells her that he's never been jealous of her because she `would never be unfaithful.'  She replies, sarcastically, `You're awfully sure of yourself, aren't you?'  Bill answers, confidently, `No, I'm sure of you.'  As a man, I feel the object ownership inherent in Bill's words.  And then Alice destroys Bill's somnambulistic, fragile, secure, culturally accepted and encouraged little lie, baring her lustful soul to him with a true confession.  With sultry and utterly visceral derision, Alice tells him, `If you men only knew.'  Freud wrote about the difficulty of uniting two currents of feeling:  the tender, affectionate feelings, with the sensual ones.  And that's the central dilemma of Eyes Wide Shut.  The real question is not whether Bill will get over his jealousy:  it's whether Alice can integrate both types of feeling into her personality, and literally redeem their relationship as the more powerfully sexual of the two.

A Beautiful Mind," Gauging reality a problem for us all
","OK, I know what you're thinking:  it doesn't take much skill to recommend A Beautiful Mind, seeing as how it took the prize for best picture at the academy awards last year, when there were several legitimate contenders. It's a no-brainer, right?  But even if you've already seen it, I suggest you take another look.  Why?  Because it raises a number of fascinating questions about ultimate reality.Here's the problem, for all of us:  if something exists solely in our minds, Can't we say that it is as real as any material object?  A famous psychologist (James Hillman) once made the point that, if mental problems are the result of a skewed or misaligned imagination, then mental healing is also a healing of the imagination.  And this is no trivial matter, because the human imagination is such a powerful thing.  An athlete who practices visualization techniques before competition, for example, is consciously rehearsing his performance in his head.  He's not actually doing his event, only thinking through it;  but his active imagination produces a measurable difference.  He's setting himself up to succeed.  So, Isn't this real?  We all imagine things that aren't real.  Are we all, therefore, crazy?  At what point does this healthy practice become destructive?The life of John Nash, as constructed by this film, gets to the heart of the question, which is particularly relevant these days because of the plethora of `reality' television shows, all of which suggest that ultimate reality is, by necessity, painful, humiliating, and bad  perhaps even evil.  John Nash, in his effort to keep his feet on the solid earth of verifiable truth without clipping the wings of his imaginative genius, comes to a different conclusion, modeled both in words and deeds by his wife.  She asks him, in a wonderful bedroom scene, `Do you want to know what's real?'  And then, placing his hand on her bosom, she answers `this.'  Love.  It's the perfect setup for the penultimate scene, where, accepting the Nobel Prize, Nash says that `it is only in the mysterious equations of love that any logic or reason can be found.'  I think it's an excellent answer to the question.",Null,0,1,9 September 2002
Psycho," The Fruits of a Fatherless Society
","`Momma's boy!'  I remember the taunt from grade school, directed at introverted and overly sensitive boys who had little athletic vigor. Momma's boys were always objects of social opprobrium, because they were exceptions to the rule.  Or were they?  At the time that Hitchcock directed Psycho, Western society had been through several industrial revolutions, which removed the father from the traditional household industry, so that the sons received their fathers' discipline, not their teaching.  And, lacking initiation rituals that removed older boys from their mothers and initiated them into the society of other men, most young men were insecure in their manhood, momma's boys who were wannabe men.  Unlike the archetypal hero of Norse mythology, who stole the key to the wild man's cage from under his mother's pillow in order to free him, these men had never released the wild man from within themselves, from their mothers' control.  And that's why Psycho is so terrifyingly brilliant:  it taps into the hidden fears of a society in which young men enter adulthood overly attached to, and overly socialized by, their mothers.  Psycho illustrates the hidden dangers of a fatherless Western society.  Norman Bates, for example, the disturbed young man of Psycho, has twelve cabins, all empty.  They represent his masculine development, perhaps even the twelve labors of Hercules, all of which have been usurped by his mother. He's content to leave the cabins unused, changing the sheets once a week, watching the sun rise and set every day without incident.  He's totally emasculated by over attachment to his mother.  Never having released the wild man, he's incredibly passive;  but, his passivity is precisely why he's also a homicidal maniac.  He's sensitive and overly delicate, unable to mention the toilet to a woman.  If he had any male friends, he wouldn't be able to belch or fart in front of them.  But his sexuality is so repressed that, when it breaks forth to the surface, it manifests itself as the fear of voyeurism or the angry control of violence.  Is it a coincidence that, at the time the film was made, the larger society as a whole was becoming obsessed with pornography, which offers both voyeurism and the false empowerment of imaginary control?  Is Norman Bates an aberrant microcosm of the rest of us?  Is that why his character is so scary?Watch it for yourself, and decide for yourself.  This is one hell of a classic.",Null,0,2,7 March 2003
Blade Runner," Science fiction as creative mythology
","We've all seen Blade Runner a thousand times.  It's a movie with universal appeal.  But the really intriguing question is, Why?  What makes us want to watch it again and again?  I think that Blade Runner's universal appeal lies in its ability to tap powerfully into our collective mythological subconscious:  in particular, its reification of two fundamental psychic forces, represented in Greek mythology by Gaia (mother earth) and Ouranos (father sky).  It has the power of a religious truth that bears repeating over and over. 
Consider the warm, dark, moist, dank feel of the film.  Wet and warm and dark, one feels the feminine energy of the womb.  The architecture is massive and heavy, suggesting feminine emotional centeredness, power, and gravity.  In one scene, there are supporting beams of enormous girth, stretching proudly upward from the ground.  But they are literally engulfed by their dark moist surroundings, and the energy of their strength and girth upward thrust seem puny by comparison.  Blade Runner has a distinctly vaginal setting, an amazingly powerful backdrop to all the masculine energy that ensues.  All the men in Blade Runner interact with artifacts.  None of them is aware of the warm smell of the earth;  nor are they intimately connected to her (the earth) as son to mother.  Instead, they interact with each other, or things.  Men treat other men as things.  They no longer need women for procreation.  They no longer need to relate to their own feminine anima (at least, they think they don't need to):  they need, or they think they need, their toys, their instruments of power and control.  Notice also that the act of creation has been usurped from women, residing also, perhaps primarily, in men's hands.  In the Hebrew Scriptures, there was always the divine `wisdom' or `Sophia' in the background with Yahweh, identical to the creative impulse of Yahweh.  In the Biblical proverbs, she speaks and says that `when he marked out the foundations of the earth, then I was with him, as a master workman.'  Creation was a feminine impulse.  But while watching Blade Runner, it feels as though men are acting out of envy of women  call it `vaginal envy' as opposed to Freud's `penis envy'  and an impulse both to dominate, and even exceed, women's creative powers.  In Blade Runner, it's a masculine psychosis on a worldwide scale. 
Which is why Blade Runner is such a timely tragedy about the consequences of male phallic dominance.  `Blade' is, of course, a highly phallic symbol. One is reminded of Odysseus's famous encounter with Circe, two polarized representatives of the feminine and masculine, Gaia and Ouranos, wherein they approach each other in a competitive relationship.  One or the other is bound to lose.  In fact, both do:  they remain polarized in their sex roles, and forfeit much of their human potential.  So Hermes, helping he hero dominate and control the woman, gave Odysseus this advice just before his encounter with the seductress:When she turns cruel, coming near With her long stick to whip you out of doors, Then let your cutting blade appear, Let instant death upon it shine, And she will cower and yield her bed.A blade is the instrument of Odysseus's domination.  Yet behind this masculine `need' to dominate lay his fear of castration, and his fear of women's creative power.  Man must control the blade, the power, or the evil woman will take away his manhood.  The male fear of castration is, in fact, a powerfully effective undercurrent in the film.  The replicants, who are in many respects superior to their human creators, are nevertheless dissatisfied with the nature that their human creators gave them;  so, they seek to deny mankind their power of creation.  They want to castrate mankind as Saturn castrated Ouranos.  There isn't a clear ray of sunshine in the entire film.  Why?  Because man is his own sun.  By the light of his own intellect and reason he has seen things that ancient Helios hasn't seen.  Man has eclipsed the sun as Saturn of Greek mythology (father of Zeus) eclipsed his father Ouranos.  As a human audience, we feel the power and hope of such divine power.  We even feel sympathy for the Eldon Tyrell, master replicant designer, when Roy squishes his head between his hands, going straight for the creative genius of his maker, the source of his generative power.  It's a beautiful thing, after all, to have such creative power.So in Blade Runner, man lives in the shadow of his own image.  Having externalized the creative power of his own feminine anima onto the things he has made, he remains disconnected from himself, existing on a lower moral plane than his own creation, the replicants, who, though dissatisfied with their own nature, at least remain true to it.  In fact, mankind is the aggressor in human-replicant relations, having projected their own dark side onto them, not unlike Yahweh and his faithful servant Job. 
Thus Blade Runner is much more than a science fiction flick.  Jung said that `One doesn't become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious.'  Blade Runner brings the darkness of our own phallic assumptions about human progress to light.  And seeing our dark impulses in the light of day, we become enlightened.",Null,0,0,19 April 2002
Amélie," Failure -- C'est La Vie
","After watching Amelie for the first time, I thought it was the best film of 2001.  After viewing it again a second time, with even more appreciation, I have come to believe that it's one of the best films -- ever.  And it's French!  My God, Who would have believed it?Amelie is a woman who lives in a fantasy world.  Conditioned to behave this way in her childhood  -- deprived of playmates, slung between a neurotic mother and an iceberg father -- Amelie prefers to dream, a personality trait that blossoms full-flower in adulthood.   Amelie habitually retreats into the private world of her imagination, where she plays, like a lonely child without any friends.  Now, I know what you're thinking:  this is another boring movie about family dysfunction and its long-term consequences, The Price of Tides with a French accent.  But I'm delighted to inform you that it's not.  In fact, it's the very the antithesis of such films.  And it's a work of uncommon brilliance for that same reason:  it takes Amelie's charming but mildly self-destructive idiosyncrasies -- her tendency to dream and remain an introvert, to `mess up her life' with stratagems, play-acting, and meddling, habits unavoidably formed in the bosom of her family -- and shows how wonderful they are.  That's right, wonderful.  Throughout the film, she is helped into the real world by the affectionate counsel of an archetypal `wise old man;' but, along the way, her preference for fantasy over reality is treated with the grace and generosity of a culture that considers human failure inevitable, perhaps even necessary;  a culture with the courage to say, simply, `that's life.'
`I love the word fail',' the barroom author says in an important but easily overlooked scene.  It's human destiny, he insists.  Doing his best `sidewalk Socrates,' he adds:  `Life is but a draft, a long rehearsal for a show that will never play.'  It's the perfect, ingenious set up for the question facing Amelie:  Will she fail, allowing herself to merge with the ebb and flow of universal woe, or will she (through love  it's so French!) overcome her common destiny to fail?  I won't spoil it for you.  Find out for yourself.",Null,1,4,9 March 2003

The Matrix," Astonishing Modern Myth-Making
","At its deepest level, The Matrix ponders the question of human alienation, a problem first contemplated by Karl Marx. Although Marx's answer was insufficient, based as it was on an unrealistically sanguine view of human nature, the problem remains just the same:  we are all slaves to a machine like system that sucks the very life out of us.  Ezra Pond described our current life in Postindustrial society so well in a few lines of verse:  `This thing, that hath a code and not a core, has set acquaintance where might be affection, and nothing now disturbeth its reflections.'  A code and not a core:  I once had a boss, as I'm sure we all have, who had a code and not a core, a puny man who treated himself, and others, as little machines Â– nothing more than isolated parts of the larger machine.  As if a cruel joke by the almighty, this man's surname happened to be `Lord,' which compelled him to refer to himself in the third person as `The Lord.'  He had a code but not a core.  In The Matrix, the machine code of cybernetic self-regulated social development is not only non-human, it is anti-human;  and people who have lost their souls to conform, who have codes instead of cores, are the norm and not the exception.  It's as prophetic as old Elijah himself.    What I love about this film is the solution it presents.  The answer is not found in a radical change of human nature, which isn't possible, or in technology, which would be like adding fuel to the fire.  Instead, borrowing from Plato's cave metaphor, which says, basically, that the world of matter we perceive with our five senses is an illusion, a mere reflection of a deeper, more permanent, reality, The Matrix also takes Augustine's belief that the road to God runs within (the whole `Zion' motif), and places the divine act of creation the very hands of humans.  Rilke thought that we are dreams in the mind of God.  According to The Matrix, however, God is a dream in the minds of men.  The power of human imagination makes it so.  In this scenario, Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams, is the voice in the wilderness who cries `prepare the way of the Lord.'  The Matrix is an astonishing piece of modern myth making.  This is what great film is all about.  If you haven't seen it in a while, it may be time for another look.",Null,1,1,7 March 2003
Donnie Darko," Way better than the average 'adolescent angst' flick
","I love films that poke fun at people with hidden agendas, with simplistically schematized views of the world, or whose self-respect comes from their jealously guarded reputations.  It's not the main theme of Donny Darko;  but, the central character is adroitly used as a foil against this background.  He suffers from none of these social afflictions.  The young Mr. Darko, exceptional in many different ways, is both troubled and gifted; the two, it seems, often go together.   It's hard to tell whether Donny's `gifts' are derived from his mental problems, for which he needs therapy, and medication, or if his mental problems are a product of his gifts.One of the reasons that the movie works so well is the way it plays with the possibility of alternate realities.  It's like this:  there are over ten dimensions, and we have access to three.  Our senses, therefore, miss most of reality.  Donnie Darko, however, has access, not specifically to another dimension, but to another reality.  Is it the product of mental imbalance; or, is his `mental imbalance' the product of an unusual gift?  `There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in your philosophy' is the over-quoted line from Shakespeare.  But it actually fits here.  It's not possible to put Donny into anyone's box, least of all the `life line' boxes in which his Catholic high school tries to shove him.One of the things that endear me to this film is the sensitivity with which the main character, Donny Darko, is treated.  He's not a brash, swaggering, posturing, overcompensating young man, as is often the case in movies about adolescents on the cusp of manhood.  Shy and somewhat retreating, he's not the type to cover his Adlerian sense of inadequacy with typical compensatory tactics.  So it's a comical irony that this young man, seemingly so ill-adjusted, is in many ways healthier than his `normal' peers.It's a gem of a movie, the likes of which comes along once in a great while.",Null,0,0,18 April 2002
