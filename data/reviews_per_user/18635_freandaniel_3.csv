Hereditary," Disturbing
",This was excellent. Made me quite uncomfortable. Wonderfully shot and put together. Good balance - possible to figure out as it goes along without spoiling things. Tasteful horror.,8,0,3,29 October 2019
It Follows," Ridiculous
","Some cool shots, I guess it could make you laugh. Other than that: this is trash. Worst thing is inconsistency and lack of any logic or depth in the plot. Classicly awful decisions from the characters in danger!",2,1,1,2 November 2019
Midsommar," A cinematic treat
","Beautiful, really well shot. For me, just the right balance of smart but explicit technique. Bit odd, but compensated by the visual pleasure.",9,0,2,29 October 2019
