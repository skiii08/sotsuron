The Blair Witch Project," The Bore of the Century
","This movie was an incredible waste of $7.  It was a bore from beginning to end.  I would have walked out on the movie but I was always waiting for something to happen.  I thought that because of all the talk I would see some crazy scary stuff, but I never did.  This movie was boring and stupid, definitely one of the worst I have ever seen.  Anyone who says otherwise is full of it.",1,0,2,1 August 1999
