Insidious: Chapter 2," Its saving graces, I think, are slick directing, a fast pace, and an effective horde of screaming, shrieking ghosties.
","It's garish, it's over the top, and it's muddled — the kind of film that begs to be lampooned by 'South Park' or 'Family Guy.' For much of its running length, it's largely a retread of its predecessor. Yet 'Insidious: Chapter 2″ (2013) still manages to be a good horror movie. I'd give it an 8 out of 10.It's pretty damn scary. Its saving graces, I think, are slick directing, a fast pace, and an effective horde of screaming, shrieking ghosties. (White-faced Screaming Abusive Mama Ghost needs to CHILLAX.) If a fright flick makes you jump a bunch of times (and during the daytime!), then you know it's a decent fright flick, right?Patrick Wilson shines. But talented Rose Byrne does little in this film beyond running around with a terrified expression on her face. (It's the screenwriter's fault, not hers.) You see that face she's making in the movie poster? That's her performance throughout almost the whole movie.Did anyone notice that 'Specs' is Leigh Whannell, one of the initial two unfortunates in 'SAW' (2004)? (He's also the screenwriter for both films.)This was a good horror movie. If you want a scare before bedtime, see it.https://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/",8,0,0,6 May 2015
Blade Runner 2049," A review of 'Blade Runner 2049' (2017)
","Denis Villeneuve's 'Blade Runner 2049' (2017) is indeed a worthy sequel, even if it cannot equal Ridley Scott's seminal 1982 original film. (And this is absolutely understandable -- I opine that Scott's dour, challenging 'Blade Runner' is arguably the greatest movie of all time.) Some of it worked, and some of it didn't -- but I sufficiently enjoyed this movie to rate it a 9 out of 10.There is a lot going on here in terms of plot. I won't be specific about what I liked and what I didn't like, because I want to avoid spoilers. (There are definitely some surprise plot developments, and this is a relatively recent film that fans have waited no fewer than 35 years to see.) But I'm happy to report that 'Blade Runner 2049' satisfies by being a direct and logical follow-up in terms of character, plot and setting.I do think that this would be a stronger standalone story if it had included the material that was relegated to the online short films that serve as its companions. (You can find all three of them at Open Culture right here.) The first one, 'Black Out 2022,' is probably necessary to understanding the feature film's story and ought to be required viewing.The visuals were vivid and arresting, the action sequences were generally satisfying, and the acting across the board was quite good. Harrison Ford was predictably perfect. Jared Leto and Sylvia Hoeks are suitably intense and make terrific bad guys. (I've always loved Leto's work -- even his criminally underappreciated, spot-on interpretation of DC Comics' 'The Joker.') And Carla Juri nearly steals the entire movie with her mesmerizing performance in a supporting role.What I liked best about 'Blade Runner 2049' was how surprisingly well it captured the ... vibe, I guess, of the first film -- its existential angst and the surprising tragic nobility of its characters. Simply put, this film got the feeling right. For me, this was best evidenced by a poetic subplot between the characters played by Ryan Gosling and Ana de Armas. It's great dystopian science fiction -- a fusion of troubling futurism and genuine human emotion. And the mood was greatly enhanced by an evocative score by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch.There are were a couple of things that I didn't like -- they were plot points that I won't detail here. The pacing also felt too slow, at times. (This is a long movie, at two hours and 44 minutes.) And the the climactic fight scene felt just a bit claustrophobic and awkwardly executed. (It's a far cry from the epic feel of the original's rainswept rooftop confrontation.)I'd still cheerfully recommend 'Blade Runner 2049' to fans of Scott's film. I'd caution them to sit down with it with as few expectations as possible, though, and to just enjoy this second chapter on its own merits. It's mostly great stuff.",9,2,5,8 April 2018
10 Cloverfield Lane," '10 Cloverfield Lane' (2016) is a capably written and well performed thriller
","'10 Cloverfield Lane' (2016) is a capably written and well performed thriller; it might not be quite worth the high praise it seems to be receiving elsewhere, but I'd still give it an 8 out of 10.Mary Elizabeth Winstead actually is terrific actress. She has far more to do here than her one-note heroine in 2011's underrated 'The Thing' prequel, and she performs beautifully. John Goodman is perfect as a mentally ill, dubious savior. John Gallagher, Jr. does just fine as a good-natured everyman in over his head.I did think that '10 Cloverfield Lane' ran a little long for its content. This could have easily been an especially well executed episode of a one-hour show like 'The Outer Limits' or 'The Twilight Zone.' It's feature-length format felt a little padded. We don't need the prologue explaining why Winstead's character is traveling. Nor do we need the movie's slowly building character arc for Goodman's 'Howard.' (We know to suspect his stability from the trailer.)This appears to have very little to do with 'Cloverfield' (2008).",8,1,4,3 April 2016
Skyfall," 'Skyfall' (2012) was a decent flick; I'd give it an 8 out of 10.
","I love modern movies that give us great action sequences without CGI, or at least without cartoonish and incredibly obvious and transparent CGI. The stunts were great. And it had good acting, good directing and fantastic dialogue. I love the way these characters talk.It suffers from a comparatively weak third act, and a bizarre villain that is far more irritating the menacing. We see no evidence that the bad guy has the physical or mental characteristics to make him an equal to Bond, which is what the movie suggests. (He's more like a rich jerk with a lisp who talks too much.)Also  as the 'Honest Trailers' gag points out  what happened to the stolen list? Wasn't that the point of the movie?",8,2,4,22 February 2015
It," A short review of'It' (2017)
","'It' (2017) succeeds on a number of levels; it's both an excellent horror movie in its own right and a faithful adaptation of Stephen King's incredible 1986 novel. It's rate it a 9 out of 10.The movie works so well because it captures the book's key juxtaposition of sweetness with horror. There is a gentle innocence about the story's circle of adolescent protagonists, who remain kind and good in King's story — despite facing an incredibly powerful monster while being alienated by adults who are shifty, feckless, or monstrous themselves. The screenwriters understand that juxtaposition, and successfully bring it to the screen. The kids here feel real, three-dimensional, quirky and damned likable. (My favorite was Eddie, the wisecracking hypochondriac, played by Jack Dylan Grazer.) It adds great tension to the story.And the monster itself is truly terrific, thanks to an inspired, menacing portrayal by Bill Skarsgard and startling visual direction that nicely summons summons both coulrophobia and grotesque (yet sometimes subtle) body horror.The film might suffer just a little from something its makers couldn't avoid — so many of its basic story elements are overly familiar tropes. King wrote his novel more than 30 years ago. 'Scary' clowns are now omnipresent in popular culture. (It's something I'll never understand. Clowns are mysteriously and positively irritating to me. They're a lot like David Tennant before 'Jessica Jones.') We've also seen more than a few alienated adolescents, period settings and shape-shifting monsters that impersonate our worst fears, in everything form 'The X-Files' to 'Stranger Things' to  other Stephen King adaptations. We don't want the filmmakers to neglect these key story components. That would ruin the movie. But they feel like overly common tropes in 2017.Still, this was a great fright flick. I can't wait for Part 2.",9,3,5,17 September 2017
Hereditary," 'Hereditary' (2018) is an expert horror film that I'm not sure you should see.
","'Hereditary' (2018) is a difficult movie to review. It's an exceptionally well made horror film, enough for me to rate it at least a 9 out of 10. But its content is so disturbing that I'm not sure that I can actually recommend it to others.From a technical standpoint, the movie is almost perfect. It's an astonishingly good first feature film for writer-director Ari Aster, it's gorgeously shot in the hills and deserts of Utah, and it's masterfully directed. The performances are uniformly perfect. If I were to name each actor who hands in a fantastic performance, I'd simply be reading its cast list. I can't remember the last time I watched a feature film in which every single major performance was exemplary. And 'Hereditary' gets damned scary in its third act. (Seriously, give it time.)The only flaws that I can think of are extremely minor. The pacing isn't perfect. (The story occasionally seems to slow when events should be accelerating.) I had problems with the way that one key character was portrayed, and there was one plot point that gave me trouble. (I can't say more for fear of spoilers.) But these things are so forgivable that they hardly merit a mention here. You simply can't argue that this movie was expertly assembled.Yet I didn't always enjoy 'Hereditary.' I'd be lying by omission if I didn't state that. I shut it off more than once, and then came back to it when I felt more able to stomach the brutal events it depicted.'Hereditary' is more than a 'dark' movie; it's gut wrenching. Even if you have read its reviews and you've seen the movie's marketing, then you still aren't anticipating what will transpire on screen. (I'd even go so far as to say that the film's marketing was misleading, but I can't specify why here.) Yes, there's a obvious 'Rosemary's Baby' (1968) vibe, and it's sometimes reminiscent of 'The Exorcist' (1973), but the movie pushes well past the boundaries of those films, and it does so fairly early on. If I, a lifelong horror fan, was turned off by this, then I'm willing to bet that it would also be too much for a lot of casual film goers. (And indeed, while critics loved this film, audiences last year generally hated it.)I'm closing with a little bit of trivia. Toni Collette gives a tour-de-force performance here as the troubled mother. If she looks familiar to you, that might be because she's also the mom in another well known supernatural horror film - M. Night Shyamalan's 'The Sixth Sense' (1999).",9,0,2,23 March 2019
Train to Busan," A few quick words on 'Train to Busan' (2016)
","Everything you've heard about 'Train to Busan' (2016) is indeed correct; it's a first-rate South Korean zombie film that fans of the genre won't want to miss. I'd give it a 9 out of 10.It's maybe a little campier than I expected, with some over-the-top zombies that feel more reminiscent of the 'Evil Dead' films than George A. Romero's movies or Robert Kirkman's work. It's also a bit long at nearly two hours — if I were editing it, I would have swapped out some of the time devoted to car-to-car melees with additional scenes showing what's transpired beyond the train. Imagine how a skilled screenwriter could further expand on the (really cool) train station plot points we already see  what if the train was forced to stop at every station? What if it couldn't stop? What if its passengers were turned away at safe areas? What if desperate stragglers tried to board the train?This was a good one, people.

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A short review of 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' (2016)
","'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' is every bit as good as you've heard; even this non-'Star Wars' geek had great fun with it. I'd cheerfully give it a 9 out of 10, and I'd recommend you give it a try even if you don't typically enjoy the franchise.Die-hard fans are currently noting all of the things that make this film unique in the series: it's the first 'Star Wars' movie without a Jedi, the first without the trademark opening text-crawl, the first one without a lightsaber duel.Casual fans might be more impressed with more general differences. Two stood out for me.One, this is the first Star Wars film since 'The Empire Strikes Back' (1980) that seems aimed mainly at adults. Yes, the fairy tale elements are still there — we have an underdog orphan searching for her father, the requisite anthropomorphic aliens, and a humorous robot mascot (which surprisingly worked quite well). But those elements are absolutely upstaged by a bona fide war film, complete with tactics, strategy, panic, collateral damage and casualties. I remember thinking during a surprisingly gritty urban warfare scene that it was as though some filmmakers had taken a scene from a film like 'The Hurt Locker' (2008) and set it within the 'Star Wars' universe.Two, I think that this is the most human Star Wars movie we've had since 'Empire.' It wouldn't be 'Star Wars' without the aforementioned aliens and robots, and plenty of references are made to the Force and the Jedi. But this is a movie about ordinary people. Yes, there is one larger-than-life character who appears  force-sensitive? This universe's equivalent of Marvel's 'Daredevil?' (This was a confusing story element that didn't always work for me.) But we are presented primarily with all-too-human anti-heroes who feel fear, suffer, and die.Isn't that more exciting than watching cartoonish aliens fight armies of equally cute battle-droids? In this film's better moments, it made me feel like a was watching a 'real' war with 'real' people, and I was surprised to find myself actually rooting for the good guys in a 'Star Wars' film — this has been a series that I've long half-dismissed as being essentially children's stories.Seriously, this was a good movie. Check it out.",9,3,6,21 December 2016
Captain Marvel," A short review of 'Captain Marvel' (2019)
","'Captain Marvel' (2019) has a couple of weaknesses, but mostly rises above them in its second half to become an entertaining big-budget popcorn movie. It generally succeeds, and I had a lot of fun with it. I'd rate it an 8 out of 10.At first, the movie comes off as a mild disappointment - a boilerplate, made-to-order space opera with a thin script, simplistic dialogue and sometimes average acting. (I personally don't think that Brie Larson has the most depth or range of any actress in Hollywood.)But the movie has a few surprises for us, both in terms of its story and its ability to win us over with humor and its sense of escapist, comic book fun. Larson does have a lot of onscreen presence and charisma, and she does fine conveying anger and urgency. She also has great deadpan comic line delivery. After seeing the film, it's difficult for me to picture anyone else in the role.The special effects were nothing short of fabulous. I didn't expect to see a Marvel film with a space battle that could compete with those of the 'Star Wars' franchise. The fan service and the continuity with other Marvel films is also terrific. Speaking of fan service - the Stan Lee tributes were genuinely touching. One of them was a threefold reference to Lee, Kevin Smith and the 1990's, when the story is set. Talk about understanding how to please your target audience.I'd recommend this.",8,0,1,15 March 2019
World War Z," I humbly opine that this movie gets just a little too much bad press.
","Visit any Internet message boards about it, and you might get the impression that its more commonly accepted title is 'The Brad Pitt Zombie Movie That Sucked.' I myself am a die-hard fan of Max Brooks' original book, but I still loved the movie.It wasn't a George A. Romero film, and it wasn't 'The Walking Dead.' (And it certainly wasn't the book.) But  that's just fine, in my opinion. It was different. It was a bangin', epic, global monster war movie with some amazing action set pieces. I think the siege of the walled Jerusalem (a subplot that actually WAS from the book), was alone well worth the price of a ticket. Not every zombie movie has to have the same tone and narrative as Romero's work or Robert Kirkman's work. Arnold Schwarzenegger's recent 'Maggie' film showed us, for example, that very different zombie movies can still be incredibly good.My only real criticism of the movie was that its plot resolution seemed  pretty damned risky. Isn't there a pretty obvious danger connected with the defense employed by Pitt's character? Maybe I missed something.",9,2,3,2 June 2015
The Hunger Games," My review of 'The Hunger Games' (2012)
","Yeah, okay. As it turns out, 'The Hunger Games' (2012) was actually a really good movie – I'd cheerfully give it an 8 out of 10. I thought that this would be a sci-fi equivalent of a Twilight franchise, or a mainstreamed ripoff of 'Battle Royale' (2000), but it was none of the former and only a little of the latter.It took a decent story and populated it with fully realized, three- dimensional characters, then cast good actors across the board. You know a movie works if you're cheering for the main protagonist. It was also a surprisingly dark story for a young adult book adaptation.The pacing was a little off  characters and plot devices are raised and dropped a little abruptly, and you can tell they were included because they were elements of Suzanne Collins' book that fans were expecting. And the action directing wasn't the best I've seen – the final standoff was a little awkwardly staged and anticlimactic. Those are small quibbles, though.If anyone really likes this, it might be fun to watch this and 'Battle Royale' back-to-back on a rainy Saturday.http://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/",8,0,4,2 November 2014
The Babadook," 'The Babdook' (2014) was a decent horror movie — maybe not quite as phenomenal as all the hype suggests, but still quite good.
","I'd give it an 8 out of 10.The acting was just great all around, the directing was good, and the movie benefits from a spooky, atmospheric buildup. The tone- setting developments with the children's book were creative, spooky and perfect. The illustrator for that book deserves a lot of credit for making this film effective.I did think the pacing was a bit slow, and the ultimate reveal of The Babadook itself was unimpressive. I immediately thought the entity looked like a cross between Edward Scissorhands and Danny Devito's The Penguin. It's ugly and annoying; I might rather punch it in the face than run from it — especially after it traumatized that poor, misunderstood kid. (I feel the same way about clowns; I will never understand the common phobia.)This film might also borrow a page or two from other horror outings. I know I've seen that playground bit before. And the first appearance of the entity closely parallels 'The X- Files' episode 'Folie a Deux.' This monster-of-the-week episode is a classic, one of the show's best. 'The Babadook's' visual and even sound effects during the ceiling scene seemed almost identical to me.Side note: does anyone else in the film or audience realize that this child is incredibly advanced if he is able to construct these weapons? The character is six years old — the best that I could do at age nine when I played vikings with the kid next door was a broomstick and a garbage can lid as a shield. I actually made a working crossbow when I was 11 or so, but it certainly didn't work like this kid's. If Australia (where the film takes place) has an equivalent to DARPA, this kid needs to work there right after engineering school.https://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/",8,2,4,21 April 2015
Us," A review of 'Us' (2019)
","'Us' (2019) passes the litmus test for a good horror movie - it is genuinely scary, thanks largely to Jordan Peele's terrific directing and its cast's immense talents. Lupita Nyong'o shines the most here; she gives a tour-de-force performance in the dual role of both a terrified woman and her savage, homicidal doppleganger. (If you've seen the trailer for 'Us,' you know it portrays a nuclear family of four being assailed by their mysterious, murderous lookalikes.) Shahadi Wright Joseph is also especially good, in the dual role as both the family's traumatized daughter and her cherubic-yet-stabbity twin. This is a creative horror film with excellent shooting and imagery, and I'd rate it an 8 out of 10.I don't know that everyone will enjoy the film as I did, as I don't think it is perfect. Its overlong third act is easily its weakest, when the traditional cat-and-mouse horror-movie antics eventually take a back seat to the film's key reveals. We do get an explanation for the clone-tastic shenanigans in 'Us,' even if it isn't altogether satisfying. There is actually an extensive fantasy/sci-fi backstory that Peele has prepared, and which I will not spoil here.But I do think that many viewers would enjoy the story more without it, as I think I would have. The movie's key reveals are implausible and slightly befuddling at first, and then grow preposterous in the viewer's mind the more that he or she thinks about them. They're presented a bit ploddingly, too, in a film that feels maybe 20 minutes too long. As good as it was, 'Us' would have been a more entertaining film if it had left the genesis of its strange events a mystery. If it had been presented as a simple, violent parable about the id, for example, it would appeal to a far wider audience and might approach the status of a horror classic, as Peele's outstanding 'Get Out' did in 2017.But that isn't what Peele wanted. The friend with whom I watched 'Us' last night sent me a great March 22 article by Aja Romano at Vox that admirably breaks down the movie's ending. Peele indeed had a more detailed and thoughtful message than a general statement about mankind's duality. Long story short - the movie's mythology might not make a lot of practical sense, but it makes a lot of sense thematically. There is some intelligent social messaging here, even if it isn't perfectly delivered. It helps if you think of 'Us' as a surreal horror story instead of a realistic one. I found that I liked the ending much more after reading this, and you might too.One more note - this is the first time I've seen Elizabeth Moss on screen. (She's in a surprisingly hilarious supporting role here; I think most readers of this blog will recognize her as the protagonist of Hulu's adaptation of 'The Handmaid's Tale.') She's got great comic timing, and she's absolutely magnetic. People keep telling me that I should watch 'The Handmaid's Tale;' maybe I really am overdue for that.",8,1,4,20 July 2019
The Hateful Eight," I hated 'The Hateful Eight' (2015)
","'The Hateful Eight' (2015) might be the first Quentin Tarantino film that I entirely disliked. I'd rate it a 3 out of 10 for being an overlong, overwrought story inhabited exclusively by irritating, overly stylized characters who are constantly shouting. It was alternately boring and grotesque. It even managed to occasionally be glumly depressing, given the violence it depicts against defenseless innocents.And I'm surprised, because this movie was highly recommended to me by my college-aged nephew - he's a smart kid whose judgment I trust. I certainly hope that he has seen Tarantino's classic 'Reservoir Dogs' (1992), as that movie seems to be this one's direct inspiration. Throughout 'The Hateful Eight's' lengthy running time (it clocks in at just over three hours), I kept thinking that this was a failed effort to transplant 'Reservoir Dogs'' story setup to the old west.That probably was the director's strategy here. You see an attempt to recreate all of the story elements that made the earlier movie a success: quirky characters; idiosyncratic dialogue; unexpected violence; tragedy; and black humor.Regrettably, it just didn't work. The movie was so long - and so loud - that it even made priceless performers like Kurt Russell, Samuel L. Jackson and Tim Roth come off as annoying.For me, the movie's sole bright spot was Jennifer Jason Leigh's damned terrific portrayal of the plot-driving, brutal gangster, Daisy Domergue. I had no idea that Leigh had such incredible range (not to mention some Vaudeville-style comic timing). Her performance isn't enough to redeem the movie, but it surprised me and easily stole the show.Look - if this is the first Tarantino movie you've seen, then please don't let it dissuade you from seeing the man's other work. Seriously, go watch 'Reservoir Dogs,' 'Pulp Fiction' (1994) or 'From Dusk Till Dawn' (1996).https://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/",Null,3,5,17 December 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," A review of 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' (2017)
","'Spider-Man: Homecoming' (2017) isn't a bad movie. To the contrary, it's a very good one — I would even rate it a 9 out of 10, if a little reluctantly.The action, humor, surprises and special effects are all top-notch; it's got a slew of fun Easter eggs and great continuity within the Marvel Cinematic Universe; and Michael Keaton hits it out of the park as the story's villain. (As Ed Harris did recently with HBO's 'Westworld,' the sublimely likable Keaton really surprised me with how he could become so intimidating.) Furthermore, the screenwriters wisely omit another redundant re-telling of the web- slinger's origin. (Even a die-hard fan like me is sick of seeing or reading about it.)I think your enjoyment of this movie might vary according to what you want Spider-Man to be. This isn't a movie in which Peter Parker or his alter ego stand out as his own man (despite its plot resolution's heavy-handed efforts to tell us that). I submit that it's fairly undistinguished as a standalone superhero film — it feels like an ancillary, companion film to the 'Avengers' movies, including last year's de facto installment, 'Captain America: Civil War.' Indeed, fan-favorite Tony Stark is 'Spider-Man: Homecoming's' most significant supporting character — far more than any of the many friends, family, love interests or villains that have long inhabited the iconic hero's mythos. Peter's primary motivation throughout the movie is his desire to become an Avenger, like a normal kid would aspire to the varsity football team. Many of his powers stem from a ultra-high-tech costume designed and given to him by Iron Man; it even has an advanced A.I. that is a femme fatale equivalent of J.A.R.V.I.S. (Fun fact: that alluring voice belongs to none other than the alluring Jennifer Connelly. The actress is the wife of Paul Bettany, who is the voice of J.A.R.V.I.S. and then the actor portraying The Vision. And Connelly herself played the love interest of 1991's mostly forgotten 'The Rocketeer,' a World War II-era hero with the a similar character concept to Iron Man.)I was a big fan of Spider-Man in the 1990's, and, believe me, the ol' web-head did just fine with his own powers, intelligence and character — and without any sort of 'internship' with Iron Man, either metaphorically or otherwise. He was also a far more popular character with readers. I was buying comics regularly between 1991 and 1996 — while Spider-Man books and merchandise were everywhere, I don't think I ever remember seeing an 'Iron Man' comic on the racks at my local comic shop. I kept thinking inwardly of Spider-Man during this movie as 'Iron Man Jr.,' and, for me, that wasn't a good thing.I also found myself musing during the film that this felt like 'Spider-Man Lite.' While 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' was fun, it doesn't have the depth, character development or gravitas of the Sam Raimi trilogy. (Yes, I even liked the third one, despite its bizarre flaws.) I know that critics are praising the movie's lighter tone, and I realize the need to avoid a simple rehash of the Raimi films. (Nobody would want that; we can rightfully expect more from the excellent MCU.) I actually prefer the Raimi films, though. While Tom Holland might be the better Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire was a strange casting choice), the Raimi movies were more  heartfelt. They were an earnest exploration of the Spider-Man of the comics, and they felt  truer. 'Homecoming,' in contrast, is yet another cool installment in the 'Avengers' series. 'Spider Man 2' came out 13 years ago, and I can still remember how that movie made me feel — not to mention how its sheer quality vindicated 'comic book movies' like no other film before it. This new movie will not be memorable that way.Anyway, although my criticisms above are obviously lengthy, please know that this is only because I love the source material so much — and we comic book fans have a tendency to analyze. I certainly enjoyed the movie, and I'd cheerfully recommend it. (Note my rating.) The MCU continues to entertain with quality movies; its consistency, even with its expanding group of ongoing Netflix series, is kind of astonishing.Go see this. You'll have fun.",9,35,65,9 July 2017
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Okay, now — this was actually a pretty good movie; I'd give it an 8 out of 10.
","And that says a lot coming from me — I gave only a lukewarm response to 'Captain America: The First Avenger,' because I thought that film was an overly safe family film that had no depth or suspense, and some awkward fight scenes. I've also opined that Captain America is one of the flatter characters on The Avengers' lineup. And he's got a simplistic character concept, even by comic book standards (super- soldier serum, anyone?).But 'Winter Soldier' does improve greatly on some various weaknesses of the origin story. The action scenes (my favorite is the highway fight) are very, very good, with well choreographed brawls and suspenseful shootouts that aren't too hard for the viewer to follow. And the space opera-level climax will definitely give action junkies their money's worth.Chris Evans actually is a really good actor, in my estimation. He seems to do a far better job here than in the other Marvel films, and the script gives Cap a depth that lets Evans show a nice range. (And dammit if he doesn't look the part.) He's a charismatic lead that lets you more easily buy into the character. And  Robert Redford in a comic book movie?! That's something I never saw coming. But what a great actor.My quibbles? There were a couple. (BEWARE – SPOILERS AHEAD.)1) Cap meets his best friend and (literal) wingman, the superhero Falcon, on a chance encounter after a run around Washington's Mall? DEUS EX EXERCISE.2) Winter Soldier is nice and intimidating with his bandit-like costume and metal (vibranium?) arm, and it's a little unnerving when Captain America's ostensible equal comes crashing into the scene. But when his mask comes off and he utters one of his few lines of dialogue, he looks and sounds like a slightly dull, soft spoken, 16- year-old boy. He's utterly nonthreatening.3) I've always been hard to please when it comes to conspiracy story lines. The larger the conspiracy, the less plausible — I refuse to believe that huge numbers of people can keep a secret so big. S.H.I.E.L.D. is an utterly incompetent spy agency if it allowed Hydra to flourish as it did within its upper echelons. Besides, Hydra is made up of weirdo fanatics — nuts like that would have a hard time blending in to a mainstream community.4) S.H.I.E.L.D. was more fun when it was made up only of good guys. I never watched the TV show, but I rooted for them in the films. It was America's everyman response to a world of super-beings, and it was sort of the committed underdog.5) Again, we are never quite sure what Cap's powers are. He can withstand 15-story falls with no major injury, but apparently isn't bulletproof.6) Why on Earth does nobody call The Avengers for help?But don't let those minor irks prevent you from checking out this movie. It's pretty decent.Comic Book Nerd Trivia — Winter Soldier looks a heck of a lot like an anti-hero named 'Nomad' in the mid-1990's. He teamed up with Daredevil when he went to Las Vegas in the 'Dead Man's Hand' storyline. It's probably the same character; I am just too lazy to look it up right now.https://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/",8,0,1,12 March 2015
Bird Box," A short review of 'Bird Box' (2018)
","Netflix' 'Bird Box' generally pleases - I'd rate it an 8 out of 10, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a creative and effective apocalyptic horror film. A few reviewers call it a 'high-concept' horror movie because of its MacGuffin - an invasion of otherworldly beings causes anyone who looks at them to hallucinate and become suicidally depressed. (A handful of survivors escape the chaotic mass suicides because they are lucky enough not to lay eyes on the mysterious, mind-bending creatures which can become images of their victims' worst fears.)It's a hell of a setup - it reminds many people of this year's 'A Quiet Place' and 2008's unfairly maligned 'The Happening.' (Hey, I really liked that movie.) For some reason, 'Bird Box' reminded me of the 1985 'The Twilight Zone' episode, 'Need to Know.' (It's a great ep.) And the plot device pays off - 'Bird Box' is genuinely unsettling, and the whole story comes across as a blackly inventive end-of-the-world tale.Sandra Bullock is good here; supporting actors Sarah Paulson and John Malkovich are even better. (Malkovich is mesmerizing whenever he plays an intense or unpleasant character.)The film suffers somewhat from puzzling pacing problems - sometimes the story appears to be unfolding too quickly, but by the end of the two-hour movie, it feels too long. 'Bird Box' was adapted from a structured 2014 novel by Josh Malerman; I strongly get the sense that it tries to squeeze too much of its source material into a the running time for a movie. I honestly think I would have enjoyed it much more if its frightening plot device and interesting, well-played characters were explored in a mini-series.There's another disappointment too - we learn very little about the story's antagonists, beyond one character's hypothesis that they're archetypal punishing figures from a number of the world's religions. I wanted to know more.",Null,1,4,21 December 2018
The Revenant," 'The Revenant' (2015) changed the way that I see movies.
","'The Revenant' (2015) changed the way that I see movies. This utterly immersive, jaw-droppingly gorgeous period thriller is easily one of the best films I've ever seen, and I plan to see it again, soon. I'd rate it a perfect 10.It's a visual masterpiece. Its cinematography renders its mountains, valleys and plains both dreamlike and lucid, and its action is unflinchingly visceral. Shot mostly in Alberta, Canada (standing in for 1823 Montana and South Dakota), the film's visuals are more stunning than anything I've ever seen. You truly do feel that 'you are there.' But 'there' is an absolutely brutal 19th century middle American winter wilderness. It's fatally dangerous, both with its unforgiving elements and with the human violence that seems to erupt casually and constantly over its land and resources — not to mention bloody retribution among groups and individuals. This isn't a movie for the faint of heart. I won't spoil the subject of its gut-wrenching action sequences for fear of spoilers — most of these sequences arrive as frightening surprises, thanks to Alejandro G. Inarritu's expert direction. It is this juxtaposition of beauty and brutality that define the movie.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hugh Glass, an American trapper who begins as one of the seemingly few characters that do not quickly resort to unnecessary violence, prejudice or revenge. He later does seek vengeance for his son's death against fellow trapper John Fitzgerald, played by Tom Hardy. (Glass was a real frontiersman who was the subject of Michael Punke's 2002 biography, 'The Revenant.' But a cursory Google search suggests to me that this is not actually 'a true story;' I think of it as loosely based historical fiction.) Like DiCaprio and Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson and Will Poulter also excel in their supporting roles. (Gleeson seems to specialize in playing reluctant innocents; I remember him from his skilled performance as the gentle young computer genius in last year's outstanding science fiction thriller, 'Ex Machina.')But the main star of 'The Revenant' is the setting itself, beautifully shot by Emmanuel Lebezki and masterfully employed by Inarritu as a kind of character unto itself in the story. It's lovely. I've never seen a movie like this. And while I'm no film connoisseur, or even a genuine critic, I've seen a lot of good ones.The direction most reminds me of Francis Ford Coppola's work in 1979's 'Apocalypse Now.' I was also reminded of Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining' (1980) — that was a film that also depicted threatening snowscapes as dreamlike and eerily beautiful. There was one shot near the end, following DiCaprio's vengeful hero on his path through immense firs on either side — it reminded me a lot of Jack Nicholson's murderous Jack Torrance on his path through the hellish hedge labyrinth.There is also a central action set piece involving an attack on one group of characters on another — it actually reminded me of Oliver Stone's work in 'Platoon' (1986). Like Stone's finale, the battle is staged so that the viewers have no sense of which direction the attack is coming from, paralleling the experience of the confused defenders. There are countless long tracking shots throughout this film, with fewer cuts — and amazing circular surrounding shots of the action. I've read that Inarritu actually had to transport cranes to his mountaintop shooting locations in order to execute those.If you had to find a flaw with 'The Revenant,' I suppose you could complain that its story and characters are thin. We know little more about DiCaprio's Glass beyond that he is competent, patient and slow to fight — then merciless and unrelenting in seeking justice. Poulter's Jim Bridger is loyal, but not as strong as the hero. Hardy's Fitzgerald is a greedy, opportunistic bully whose murder of an innocent drives the plot. That's  little more than the plot and characters of a lot of throwaway westerns, isn't it? (I've indeed seen this movie categorized as a western in reviews. That's technically correct, I guess, but it feels too unique to pigeonhole that way.)You could easily read the movie for moral ambiguity. There are the obvious issues connected with revenge, of course, underscored by a final shot in which one character appears to break the fourth wall. I found myself wondering about Glass' compatriots. Yes, it is Fitzgerald who acts villainously, but all of Glass' fellow trappers also consign him to death by abandoning him after his injuries. I do understand that they feel they can't survive themselves if they try to carry him back to their staging area at Fort Kiowa. But  is what they do 'right?' What would you or I do?I think I am coming too close here to revealing too much about the film. The best way to experience 'The Revenant' is to walk into it knowing little about it. I strongly recommend you do so.",10,1,2,10 April 2016
Split," A short review of 'Split' (2016)
","For much of its running length, I was considering writing a review for 'Split' (2016) that rated it a perfect 10. (I am an unabashed fan of M. Night Shyamalan, no matter how reviled he is by other Internet commentators.) I love the way he frames his shots, I love his dialogue, I love his stories, and I love the strange way he can make a slowly paced film nevertheless absorbing.)And 'Split' looked nearly perfect. James McAvoy handed in a tour- de-force performance as Kevin, a man with dissociative identity disorder (DID). (Yes, I am aware of the clinical controversies connected with whether the disorder even exists — I was a psychology student many, many years ago. I think we should suspend whatever disbelief we have for the purposes of enjoying the movie.) McAvoy plays his role to perfection. His 'Dennis' persona is particularly frightening, and 'Barry,' one of the 'good personalities' he portrays, is surprisingly endearing and sympathetic.Playing off McAvoy wonderfully are Betty Buckley as his gentle psychiatrist and Anya Taylor-Joy as one of three teenaged girls kidnapped by his nastier personalities. The talented Taylor-Joy was also perfect in her role. (I last saw her 2015's 'The Witch' and she was also in last year's 'Morgan;' I'm gaining the impression that this promising young specializes in cerebral horror-thrillers.)I would rate 'Split' an 8 out of 10. It suffers a bit, I think, from two missteps toward the end. One, this taut psychological thriller takes an ill-advised turn into dark fantasy. I thought it was amazingly good as a thriller grounded only in the real world — it was far less so with the later jarring story elements. (I do realize why Shyamalan made this creative decision, and you will too, after watching it and then reading up on it.) But I still think that this would have been a perfect film if the majority of it focused on McAvoy's personalities either aiding or misleading his psychiatrist, with Taylor-Joy's fate hanging in the balance.Two, this film seemed to suffer from the too-many-endings syndrome that people often associate with Peter Jackson's 'The Lord of the Rings' movies. We seem to have one denouement that works quite well, then a second that should have been re-shot and re-scripted. And then there's another plot strand finally addressed  but it is played so subtly that I'm not even sure I got it. And this isn't even counting the significance of the movie's final line, which works as a fantastic framing device.About that line  if you're a Shyamalan fan, then you simply must watch the film until it's very end, as the camera pans through the coffee shop. You'll love it.",8,15,33,8 April 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man," Did we really need a reboot of the Spider-Man films after Sam Raimi's great run? Probably not.
","'Spider-Man 2' (2004) was one of the greatest comic book movies of all time, and even the problematic 'Spider-Man 3' (2007) wasn't nearly as bad as its many detractors said. Besides, superhero stories are serial by nature, there's no need to stick to a trilogy. Why not just let Raimi, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst continue to do their thing? (I never realized how much I liked Dunst as Mary Jane until she was absent.)Because of the Christopher Nolan 'Batman' films, that's why. 'The Amazing Spider-Man' (2012) is an obvious (and unnecessary) attempt by Columbia Pictures to give Marvel Comics' flagship character the Nolan treatment. IMDb.com even states that the filmmakers credit 'Batman Begins' (2005) as an influence.With all of that said, though, 'The Amazing Spider-Man' is actually a pretty good movie – I'd give it an 8 out of 10. It doesn't match the charm, humor and sense of fun that Raimi and co, brought us; Peter Parker and Aunt May here and not as likable or relatable. (But Martin Sheen is awesome as ever as Uncle Ben.)But Andrew Garfield is funny and talented, and he does a great job. This movie actually IS truer to the comics that I remember. Garfield's great line delivery finally gives us the wise-cracking Peter Parker Maguire couldn't pull off. And the Spider-Man I remember from my school days wasn't quite the vulnerable wallflower that we've seen in the Raimi films – especially when thrown into the mix with characters like Wolverine or The Punisher.This is definitely an edgier, grittier Spider-Man story. He gets hurt. He bleeds. The script is slick, smart, understated and obviously aimed at a more adult audience. There's good sci-fi villain who is rendered wonderfully by CGI; he makes the Green Goblin seem silly by comparison. And the action sequences were damned good – we get some great, wicked-cool fight choreography that seems true to the character and even reminded me a little of great comic book fight movies like 'Blade' (1998).This reboot does suffer a bit from the superfluous and laborious re- telling of Spider-Man's origin story. How many people are unaware that Peter Parker was bitten by a radioactive and/or genetically modified spider? How much more exciting would it be to see Spidey fight, oh, say, Carnage?All in all, this was a decent movie. To enjoy it, you just sort of have to take it on its own terms instead of comparing it to Raimi's flicks.http://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/",8,0,1,28 September 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Just a few quick thoughts about 'X-Men: Days of Future Past.'
","And, no, that is not a lame attempt at a 'Quicksilver' pun. Honestly.I really, really liked it. It isn't my favorite 'X-Men' movie — those will always be what is arguably the darkest of the franchise ('X2: X-Men United') and the lightest ('X-Men: First Class'). But it's definitely a nice addition to the series.Here are a few reactions, with minimal spoilers, in no particular order:-- What a radical shift in tone from 'First Class.' Way to bring the pathos, Bryan Singer. The opening scenes are brutal, and there are many major character deaths. Some of them occur off screen; others do not. Some are violent. I do believe this is the first superhero movie I have ever seen in which a major character and fan favorite has his or her head crushed, in close-up, during the opening action set piece.Speaking of the opening segment, will somebody please validate my uber- nerd-dom and tell me that they saw what I saw?! I KNEW that the overflying airships that are dropping The Sentinels looked familiar. Am I nuts, or are those none other than facsimiles of the lone 'Valhalla' airship depicted in the woefully under-appreciated 'Marvel 2099″ universe from the mid-1990′s?! If Singer intended that, it's a terrificly obscure and fun shout-out to 40-year-old comic book fans. (Ahem.)There isn't any unnecessary exposition to bore us. This is a major issue in comic book movies. We can forgive the Christopher Nolan films for revisiting Bruce Wayne's metamorphosis, because those films were exceptionally well made. The new Spider-Man films? Not so much. In 'Future Past,' we have thankfully no flashbacks for every single character. We're briefly told that there is a global pogrom waged by The Sentinels against mutants and innocent humans, and that Xavier and Magneto have joined forces to fight the good fight. Then we're shown various heroes with various superpowers fighting. We don't need to know all of their backstories.The action scenes were very well directed. Nice work, Mr. Singer. The special effects were top notch. What great fun it was seeing Blink, Iceman, Quicksilver and Bishop do their thing.Given the movie's central plot device why on earth are we concerned with Mystique, and not Rogue, given their respective powers? There are a few obvious guesses One, Mystique is a more popular character. Two, Jennifer Lawrence has more star power than Anna Paquin. Still, this bugged me throughout the film.I personally hate the plot device itself, in which various characters can steal or borrow others' powers.Time travel is also a frequently unwieldy plot device, but I think it was capably handled here, thanks to careful writing and a little restraint.It would also be just great if somebody could explain to me how Mystique apparently alters her body mass.I love how this movie and 'First Class' integrate the comic book mythology with real world events. It's pure fun, especially the nod at JFK.Once again, we have an 'X-Men' movie in which the darker characters are less predictable and more fun to follow. A better adjusted and more grounded Wolverine makes perfect sense. (We don't need to endlessly revisit the same character arc.) But he actually is less interesting when he becomes more stable. And characters like Beast are flat out boring. I'm happy that we spent a nice amount of time with Magneto, Mystique, and the human antagonists.Speaking of which, Peter Dinklage was perfect as Bolivar Trask. What a performance — especially with respect to making weighty dialogue sound natural — look again at his reaction to the suggestion that he hates mutants. Incredibly good line work. Is this the same guy as in 'Games of Thrones?' I refuse to watch that show simply because I am tired of hearing about it. But the 'X-Men' movies seem to do a great job providing us with human adversaries that are threatening despite an absence of super-powers.Michael Fassbender is simply a wonderful actor, and he is perfectly cast as Youngneto. He vocalizes and emotes just like a raging, charismatic ideologue.If I said that Patrick Stewart's and Ian McKellan were fantastic, that would just be belaboring the obvious.I like Jennifer Lawrence. I do. She was great as a strong, sympathetic protagonist in 'The Hunger Games.' And she deserves her fanbase. But here, she just doesn't demonstrate range enough to play a vengeful, homicidal woman. Rebecca Romjin did a better job of giving us a good, scary, bogeyman to make us think that humans needed protection by Xavier's kids. Or, for an amazing example of a young actress portraying anger and vengeance, look no further than co-star Ellen Page's amazing performance in the brutal, incredible movie, 'Hard Candy' (2005). Furthermore, Mystique, as written here and in 'First Class,' just isn't as much fun. No, she wasn't really an identifiable character in the previous movies, but she was a great bad guy — something that a doe- eyed, redeemed Mystique just isn't.Quicksilver steals the show. Evan Peters was awesome. Unsupervised teenagers with superpowers are always fun. This movie takes a lighter look at what transpired in the extremely enjoyable 'Chronicle' (2012). What would happen if this kid met those kids?It's rather nice seeing how this movie placates fan complaints with 'X- Men 3: The Last Stand.'If you're the kind of flick nut who enjoys movie marathons, good luck figuring out where this film fits chronologically with the other movies! :-Dhttp://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/2014/06/15/just-a-few-quick- thoughts-about-x-men-days-of-future-past/",8,2,3,16 June 2014
Captain America: Civil War," It's easily on par, if not better, than the first two 'Avengers' movies.
","'Captain America: Civil War' (2016) is nearly everything I hoped it would be; it's easily on par, if not better, than the first two 'Avengers' movies. (And I can't help but think of this as the third 'Avengers.' Yes, Cap's name is in the title, but this is necessarily an ensemble story about the divided superteam.) I'd give it a 9 out of 10.I honestly just need to be very vague in this review Â… this is such an eagerly awaited film, and I want to be extra cautious about spoilers. No, there are no twists in the movie, but there are surprising character and plot elements.The movie surprised me in a couple of ways. One, this film appears to follow the original 2006 comic book crossover only very loosely. (I have not read it, but I know the story.) There is no 'Superhero Registration Act' that would directly affect countless people in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's much narrower than that â€” a demand by the United Nations for direct oversight of The Avengers.Two, this is definitely the darkest and most adult outing with The Avengers so far. Don't get me wrong â€” the levity and gee-whiz comic book fun that is the MCU's trademark is still there, and it's no Christopher Nolan movie. But the movie's central story device is set in motion by the question of who should be held accountable for civilian deaths. And so many individual major characters are motivated by grief or rage.This is notable throughout the film, for example, in the characterization of Tony Stark, and his portrayal by Robert Downey, Jr. He's no longer a wisecracking billionaire playboy who all the guys want to be. Instead, he's a troubled, pensive leader who often seems out of his depth. We watch as his team and the events surrounding him spin out of control, and we no longer want to trade places with him. He's more sympathetic. But he simultaneously fails to engender the viewer loyalty that he so quickly and easily won in every other Marvel movie he's appeared in.And yet Â… he isn't, as I had suspected, a cardboard adversary for Captain America's underdog to stand up to. There are some sad things going on in his life, both during the events of this movie and in 'Iron Man 3' (2013), and his failings and poor decisions are perfectly understandable. (I won't say more, besides that viewers will definitely get a different spin on 'Iron Man 3' after this movie.) And Downey displays a great range in playing this far sadder Tony.One character in the movie even makes a quip about 'The Empire Strikes Back' (1980), and it feels like a meta reference, as that film is regarded as the darkest in the 'Star Wars' original trilogy. (And their are story structure similarities as well.)But don't get me wrong â€” 'Captain America: Civil War' still brings loads of fun. It's an effects-laden, geeky, hero-against-hero, superteam gangfight that is straight out of every Marvel fan's dreams. (And, needless to say, it's far better than its analog this year from DC.) Tom Holland might be the best Spider-Man yet. The action is damn pleasing, and the one-liners made me laugh out loud. ('Made ya look.')The bromances (including the broken ones) seemed real to me. I found myself liking and caring about Â… Winter Soldier, of all people, and I kept hoping things worked out with his friendship with Cap. (Sebastian Stan impressed me in the role for the first time.)",9,0,3,6 May 2016
American History X," I'm glad I watched 'American History X' (1998).
","It's a good, smart, enjoyable film. I learned from it.I'd really rather not discuss its social or political messages. One glance at an online discussion of this movie shows that they're divisive and often ugly. (There are even ongoing debates about which gangs or groups should rightly be called 'Skinheads,' and which are racist.) I'm just not in the mood for controversy this morning. I'd rather just tell you what I thought about AHX as a film.This movie had a lot of great things going for it, but two things stood out in particular. The first was Edward Norton's tour de force performance. I've liked Norton elsewhere, like 'Red Dragon,' where he was good. Here, he's phenomenal. He's goddam frightening as Neo-nazi Derek. (He reminded me of Bill Moseley's turn as 'Otis Driftwood' in 'House of 1,000 Corpses.') Then we see him as a redeemed man. Then, through flashbacks, he's made even more human and three-dimensional, as we see a sensitive young teenager traumatized by the death of his father. Norton was so damned good that I still seem to have trouble believing that the same actor played all three roles. I don't pretend to be a film expert; reviews like this are just a hobby. But I think I know great acting when I see it, and this was great acting.The second was a really smart script. Again, I learned from this. I always assumed that Neo-Nazis were poorly educated nuts from the fringes of society. As it turns out, they actually do have an ideology, albeit a horrible and misguided one. This movie makes a very smart move in scripting Derek and his younger brother as 'brilliant' students, who articulate facts and motivations for doing odious things. Listening to Derek's tirades (including one cringe- inducing scene at a dinner-table) actually sheds light on what motivates the characters' real-life counterparts.Only two small things occurred to me that made this film a little less perfect than so many others have claimed it to be. First, this movie doesn't even know the meaning of subtlety. Its message and delivery were so heavy handed that it was almost an ABC afterschool special. We even have an overly convenient framing device – Derek's adulating brother, Danny (played wonderfully by Edward Furlong), is asked by an African American history teacher to write a report on Derek's life. The superior film, 'Crash' (2004,) for example, handled racism with a hell of a lot more finesse and surprises.Second, one character arc was way too quick and implausible. After one conversation with his redeemed older brother, Danny also disavows the Neo-nazi movement? After years of propaganda and socialization by the group? I'm not so sure a disturbed, fascist teenager can be deprogrammed so easily. Did anyone else who saw this movie wonder about this as well?Still, this was a great film. I'd give it a 9 out of 10. One final note – the ending quote by Abraham Lincoln was just beautiful. I'd actually heard only snippets of it sampled by films before – once in 'Apocalypse Now' and once in 'X2: X-Men United.' It's better in its entirety.",9,1,2,29 September 2014
Enchanted," Yes, I actually watched this. (A review of 'Enchanted.')
","Because while I have a love of horror movies, I also have high school friends with small children.She REFUSES to let me show her three girls the whimsical magic of 'Donnie Darko,' even though that film is clearly appropriate for children. (It has a talking rabbit.) So the five of us watched 2007's 'Enchanted,' and I liked it a lot. Because the laughter of little girls can be infectious after a long day.If you're an adult, you can have good fun watching Disney lampoon its own clichés, all the while avoiding them — the gently spurned would- be stepmother here, for example, isn't 'wicked.' The fish- out-of water humor of a Disney princess inhabiting the 'real world' is accessible to adults. And Susan Sarandon is a pleasure to watch in any film — I actually never realized before what a great voice she has until I heard it connected with her animated equivalent here. (The movie is bookended by animated segments.)You can also have great fun trying to recognize the genteel characters as actors you've seen in other movies. The bubbly, clueless princess here is none other than the reserved, highly intelligent Lois Lane in 'Man of Steel' (Amy Adams). I spent the whole film trying to figure out who the prince is, until I realized it was Cyclops of without his visor (James Marsden). And the character of Nathaniel is none other than Timothy Spall, who every film fan will recognize as Thomas Tipp from the priceless 'Vanilla Sky.' Spall is also in another group of movies  apparently there is this really popular film franchise about a boy wizard? (It might be based on a book series.)Seriously, this is a fun, safe movie for small children that you can also enjoy with them.Since the girls liked this so much, I am going to screen 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' for them if my friend lets me babysit. That's a fun, fish-out-of-water story with a strong female protagonist too.http://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/",Null,2,2,25 September 2014
Avengers: Endgame," A short and spoiler-free review of 'Avengers: Endgame' (2019)
","Mind. Blown.If I could tell my 19-year-old self discovering superhero comics in college exactly how good their big screen adaptations would become, I wouldn't believe me.I saw 'Avengers: Endgame' (2019) tonight with expectations that were very high. It was still better than I thought it would be. It was easily better than last year's 'Avengers: Infinity War' (although I think of them as two halves of the same epic movie). I don't pretend to be a film expert, so take this as speculation - I personally think the pair of 'Infinity' films have made comic-book movie history in the same manner as the original 'Superman' (1978), Tim Burton's 'Batman' (1989) and Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight' trilogy (2005-2012).I don't really want to make any more observations, because I'm too afraid of inadvertently posting spoilers. But I will say that there is a massive tonal change between 'Infinity War' and 'Endgame.' The banter and humor of the former is largely left aside, and this concluding story is darker and far more emotionally sophisticated. It's moving. It feels strange to write here, but I kept thinking during the movie that this was a more 'grown up' Marvel film.And it is EPIC. I honestly can't imagine how Marvel can top it with future films. There is an action set piece that made my jaw drop. I can't say more.This is an obvious 10 out of 10 from me.",10,0,4,26 April 2019
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," A beautifully rendered, immersive fantasy that still falls short of being a truly great movie.
","I felt the same way about 'The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug' (2013) as I did about its predecessor — it's a beautifully rendered, immersive fantasy that still falls short of being a truly great movie. I'd give it an 8 out of 10.The special effects are downright beautiful. We've got a fantastic dragon to behold. The acting is roundly terrific too. I can only imagine it must be harder for a professional actor to portray a hobbit, dwarf, elf, or wizard, with their stylized language and fantastical quirks. Yet every member of the cast was either good or great. The obvious standouts are Sir Ian McKlellan as Gandalf and Martin Freeman as Bilbo. Ken Stott as Balin was also quite good.Yet the monsters and action were sometimes so cartoonish that they really challenged an adult viewer's willing suspension of disbelief. The battle sequence involving the barrels, for example, seemed like something out of a Warner Brothers cartoon.I also noticed a couple of other things. This is my fifth of Peter Jackson's 'The Lord of the Rings' movies that I've watched, and I am beginning to understand the viewer contention that these film's story structures consist of a lot of 'walking and fighting.'The most interesting story element, for me, was Bilbo's use of The Ring as his secret weapon — all the while concealing its magic from his comrades and first gaining the psychic attention of Sauron. We also see hints that he may develop his own slavish devotion to The Ring, spookily suggested when he brutally attacks the giant spider assailants who might jeopardize his possession of it. The Ring's subplot (and the way it sets up 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy) engaged me more than anything else. Throughout all the films, it's a fantastic story device, and well suited for a fantasy context. The Ring could be a metaphor for greed, love of power, possessive love, or even drug addiction. It adds so much depth to the Lord of the Rings universe, and goes far beyond a story of little good guys fighting big bad guys. To me, The Ring and Bilbo were far more entertaining than traveling dwarfs greeting or fighting characters throughout Middle Earth.There may have been pacing problems; this felt slow. I got the sense that too much time was spent establishing Lake-town and its (fairly boring) residents, although it was great seeing the immeasurably talented Stephen Fry's surprise turn as its 'Master.' Too much dialogue is devoted to things like arguing with elves, negotiating boat rides, and penetrating a magic door. (And I'm still not sure how the 'last light of  day' translates into an Autumn moon.)This was a good movie, even for someone who isn't a fan of the source material. Given its length and its slower pacing, however, I may not feel the need to see the third film right away.",8,1,4,29 July 2015
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," A short review of 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' (2012).
","I actually really liked 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' (2012). I'd give it an 8 out of 10. And that's even with my own admitted possible bias, as I am not a huge fan of traditional fantasy. I certainly can't claim to be a fan of the original books, because {downcast eyes}, I've never read them. I tried 'The Silmarillion' once, because I thought that was supposed to come first in J.R.R. Tolkien's chronology  and I just couldn't stay with it. So I guess my take on this movie is that of an outsider, as it was with Peter Jackson's 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy.But this was enjoyable movie for anyone, I thought. It's a total immersion into an incredibly beautifully rendered fantasy world. I thought the sets and backgrounds were more detailed than the first films, for example. It's a gorgeous movie to look at. The acting is uniformly excellent throughout. And the continuity is just great; there are well crafted segues into subplots that will eventually lead to the original trilogy.I think the only thing that hampered my enjoyment was that it felt so much like a children's story. (I believe I read once that Tolkien actually began his novel as a bedtime story for his children, while his subsequent 'Rings' epic was intended for adult, mainstream readers.)Peter Jackson had his creative sensibilities planted firmly in childhood fairy tale when constructing this movie. For an outsider, this seems like a standard (and sometimes predictable) quest movie. We have a tremendous deus ex machina at the end that a child might not recognize, but this adult did.The dialogue, monsters and action were often too cartoonish for me. As a fan of creature features, I found the monsters were often too silly to be credible. (I had this small quibble, as well, with the original film trilogy.) With the outstanding exceptions of the Warg and the White Orc, they often seemed like CGI-rendered cartoons. The three trolls who want to cook the dwarfs, for example, were like something out of a silly Hanna-Barbera cartoon. If this film was supposed to engage adult viewers, this creative approach was a pretty big misfire.But I recommend this, even to people who don't typically enjoy sword-and-sorcery fantasies.Seriously, though  that deus ex machina at the end  if such an option is available to our heroes, why not employ it from the start of the movie? Hell, why not employ it throughout the entire 'Rings' trilogy?",8,1,3,13 July 2015
It Follows," 'It Follows.' (It's great!!)
","(WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS FOR 'IT FOLLOWS' (2014).)A smaller budget doesn't hurt this great indie horror film; I'd give 'It Follows' a 9 out of 10.It's smart, surreal, creepy and atmospheric, and it's beautifully shot. Maybe it has some similarities with 'The Ring' series, and also the little known excellent horror film, 'From Within' (2008), but it's still darkly creative and original.It's damn scary too — it's terrific what this film accomplished with what looks like minimal CGI. For some reason, a certain shot of a rooftop really got under my skin. So, too, did a sequence depicting friends unable to warn a major character, because they're unable to see 'It' approach.I have always had a weird thing about dopplegangers. Other people hate clowns; I get creeped out by shapeshifters. I'm frightened by any monster that can masquerade as allies or loved ones. It's part of the reason that the Alien Bounty Hunter worked so well for me as an antagonist on 'The X Files' (1993), and why the T-1000 scared me in 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' (1991). Even Mystique, 'The X-Men' franchise's anti-hero, could be a little unsettling every once in a while. (An attack on Wolverine BY Wolverine? Leaving his confused teammates unable to help? That's a little creepy.)There are a bunch of themes served up by 'It Follows' that you could walk away discussing with your friends; online critics are quick to point out sexually transmitted disease. (A little on the nose, don't you think?) They also pointed out mortality — this was something that I actually missed, despite the fact that it was helpfully hinted at by one character who periodically reads Dostoyevsky aloud.I personally thought the film tapped into a bunch of sexual taboos and anxieties — especially incest. Consider the conversation about one character kissing a sibling, a face we see in a framed photograph toward the end, and the way 'It' attacks another major character. I also saw victimization — as with 'The Ring,' the victims of the monster here are presented with a tremendous moral quandary about how they might save themselves or at least forestall an attack.Is water a motif? Much screen time is devoted to characters entering pools or the ocean; one person also begs for water during an attack.And what about wealth? Much seems to be suggested by characters traveling from an affluent neighborhood to a poor one. And all those sweeping shots (and excellent long tracking shots) of the protagonists' beautiful neighborhood really stayed with me. I kept thinking about how much I'd like to live there.I'd love to know more about the origin and modus operandi of 'It.' There is a sequel planned, according to Wikipedia; that's one of its possible plots.This is a terrific scary movie! Watch it tonight!",9,44,87,7 May 2015
X-Men: Apocalypse," A review of 'X-Men: Apocalypse' (2016)
","At the start of 'X-Men: Apocalypse' (2016) I was worried that I was finally beginning to experiencing a degree of 'viewer fatigue' in connection with the beloved franchise. This would be the ninth film since the X-Men first hit the big screen in 2000, if you count this year's 'Deadpool,' and its somewhat formulaic setup felt by-the- numbers. Once again, a diverse, earnest, international group of young people unite under Charles Xavier's leadership to combat an even greater threat than the one presented by the last film. (This time it's 'Apocalypse,' a Big Bad with truly godlike powers.) And they save the day despite their youth, their inexperience, their self-doubt or the suspicions of a prejudiced humanity.) How exciting can the arrival of Angel (Ben Hardy) and Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee) be if these were already key reveals in past movies? And  the cameo?There are script problems. The whole thing is cluttered with too many major characters. Many are thinly drawn; a few make inexplicable, major decisions that affect the plot. Fan favorites like Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) get too little attention to make their ardent fanbases happy, I think. The villain looks like a middle-aged and particularly grumpy member of Blue Man Group.And, yet  I still frikkin' loved this. I'd grudgingly give it a 9 out of 10, simply because I enjoyed it so much. It's the X-Men. It's a big-budget, globally staged smackdown with great special effects, and it was obviously made by people who love the source material and tried to stay true to it, despite its inevitably campy nature and its implausibility. Characters like Havoc (Lucas Till) and Psylocke (Olivia Munn) are fun to watch. (Am I the only one who nostalgically remembers the latter character from the 90's comic books?) There is even a really nice stab at self-referential humor poking fun at the earlier films.This movie had two things going for it that really made me want to see it a second time around. The first is Quicksilver. The X-Men movies will probably never equal the skillfully made blockbusters of that other Marvel universe, but I'll be damned if the franchise doesn't totally beat them out in rendering this character. (Yes, this is indeed the same character in the comics who inspired Scarlet Witch's brother in 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' (2015).) Evan Peters brings great charisma to the role; the special effects connected with his action sequences are beautiful and goddam perfect. He's easily cooler and more likable than any other teen superhero I can remember — and that includes Tom Holland's excellent new Spider-Man.The second thing that make me want to watch it again is the action sequences. The finale is damn fun. I think it must be difficult to write, stage, direct and physically perform a melee among a group of combatants with various superhuman abilities and varying degrees of power. But the climax here works. It's an entertaining battle that feels like it was lifted perfectly from the comics, and it ought to please fans of the genre.Anyway, I obviously do recommend this. Check it out.",9,5,10,30 May 2016
Ex Machina," When Stanley Kubrick Meets Alfred Hitchcock (A Short Review of 'Ex Machina')
","I was all set to skewer 'Ex Machina' (2015). I thought that the title smacked of cliché and pretense, and it looked so much like a boiler-plate boy-meets-girlbot maudlin melodrama. How wrong I was — this movie deserves a 9 out of 10 for being the smartest and most surprising film I have seen in recent memory.I won't say much, for fear of spoilers. All three leads handed in perfect performances — Alicia Vikander is simply fantastic as an example of artificial intelligence, and this is coming from a nerdboy who has rewatched everything from 'Blade Runner' to '2001: A Space Odyssey' to Ron Moore's 'Battlestar Galactic.' Man, how amazing would it be to watch a film in which the HAL 9000 is her adversary? (I want to say more here about that, but won't spoil why it would be so interesting.)If you are watching this movie and think it is descending into cliché and predictability, stay with it. I counted no fewer than four major twists by the story's conclusion. One is predictable; the remaining three are not. And the last one is a real killer. I was all set to write up an account of the story's plot holes, but director Alex garland was 10 steps ahead of me the entire time.My only two remaining criticisms are pretty mild, and they are echoing other reviewers. One, this movie is a bit long and slowly paced. Two, we see extremely little action, which wouldn't have been gratuitous if the story called for it. The one 'action' sequence we see is also underwhelming and poorly staged. (Its combatants seem to be on heavy doses of lithium.) Please, people, do not pay for a ticket thinking you are about to see an action- thriller  Or  even a quickly paced thriller.Don't let those quibbles bother you, though. This is a great cerebral science fiction movie.",9,5,14,19 May 2015
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A short review of 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' (2017)
","I'll never be able to love 'Star Wars' the way its lifelong fans do. After the unexpected magic of the first three films, the subsequent movies almost always seemed to me to be just space fantasies for kids, formulaically developed to hit all the right notes and sell licensed merchandise. (The exception would be last year's generally excellent 'Star Wars: Rogue One,' which uniquely felt like a genuine, human story that a creator wanted to tell, rather than something brainstormed until consensus in a corporate writers' room.) With that said, I'll happily report here that 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' was actually very good - as someone with little favorable bias toward the franchise, I'd rate it an 8 out of 10.The movie simply got more right than it got wrong. It's still a marketing-oriented space opera developed for mass appeal, but it managed to rise above that because its many elements included more hits than misses.If I had to pick one thing that made this movie succeed for me, it's the balance it struck between its epic war story and its narrower sword-and-sorcery central plot thread. I like how the film began with an interstellar war - it had ordinary, mortal, relatable human characters fight and make sacrifices. Anyone can relate to characters like that because they are interchangeable with people fighting a war in our world. (It was also excellently rendered, in terms of fantastic visuals and some creative ideas.) Only afterward does the movie layer in the far-out Jedi stuff, which contrasts the war story and adds complexity to it.The second thing I liked about it was its terrific special effects - I've never seen a 'Star Wars' movie without them, even if the prequels had a more cartoonish, toylike quality to what they depicted.The third, I think, was the return of Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker. Hamill is actually quite a good actor, and his skilled turn here was alternately funny and dramatically convincing. I found myself more nostalgic after watching Luke's return to the franchise than after Han Solo's return in 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' (2015). (And I love Harrison Ford just as much as everyone else in the universe.)Is there a lot to nitpick? Sure. In addition to some plot holes, the character of Rose was rather annoying. (Spunky young idealists can grate on the nerves if they're too cutesy and seem to ingratiate themselves to the viewer.)But a far larger weakness is that 'the force' has become more of a deus ex machina than ever before. I can't be specific here because I want to avoid spoilers, but both the Jedi and their Sith counterparts employ incredible new powers in the movie that are absolutely unprecedented. It isn't explained at all, and it isn't consistent with any prior 'Star Wars' movie. And it feels like a cheat that is both sweeping and ... a little strange.Still, I'd recommend this movie - even if you didn't love every 'Star Wars' movie you've seen in the past.I'll end with a quick note about the 'porgs' - those little penguinesque aliens that are supposedly dividing longtime fans into opposing war-camps. I loved the damn things. It makes perfect sense that Luke's hideaway planet would have local fauna. And I read that the filmmakers actually did include them for an understandable reason. The island shooting location's landscape was inhabited by puffins. It made more sense to overwrite them with CGI stand-ins than to digitally remove them altogether.",8,1,4,21 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," A very short review of 'Guardians of the Galaxy' (2014)
","I had fun with 'Guardians of the Galaxy' (2014). I'd rate it an 8 out of 10, if a little grudgingly. For me, it started quite strong with its introduction of Chris Pratt's roguish space antihero; I actually had no idea he could be this funny. (I've only seen him once before, weighed down by the failed comedic scripting of 2015's 'Jurassic World.')I'm sorry to say that my interest in 'Guardians of the Galaxy' waned just a bit as it subsequently unfolded as a cartoonish, relatively tame, family-friendly adventure - complete with a heartwarming value-of-friendship lesson. That's fine, I guess - it's cool and it makes sense that the Marvel Cinematic Universe should offer films more appropriate for younger viewers. Can you imagine, however, how hilarious this movie would be if it truly deserved its (befuddling) PG-13 rating, and really pressed the envelope? Between Pratt's wit and these offbeat character concepts, it would be amazing.I still had fun with this, though, thanks mainly to the action and the impressive special effects. I'd recommend it, and I'm planning on seeing the sequel.Postscript - people are saying that this is the MCU's answer to 'Star Wars,' and I suppose it could be. But I had a lot more fun thinking that the movie was channeling Harry Harrison's priceless science fiction book series featuring criminal-antiheroes - the 'Stainless Steel Rat' adventures.",8,1,2,26 December 2017
Jurassic World," My review of 'Jurassic World' (2015), with Bryce Dallas HowAreYaDarling
","'Jurassic World' (2015) was raptortastic and T-Rexific. It was also fun in another way, but I can't think of a pun for 'Indominus Rex.' I'd give it an 8 out of 10.Seriously — this was a fun monster movie. (I, for one, maintain that these are horror-sci-fi movies at heart, and not the family adventure films that others seem to take them for. Even the theme music for this entire franchise seems to insist that a zippity good time was had by all, after dinosaurs devour adults and traumatize lost children.)The kid in me thrilled to this movie's great outstanding special effects and abundance of monsters. Those raptors are the coolest movie monsters since Aliens and Predators.The action sequences were wonderful. Did anyone else think the initial attack/ambush was an homage to the initial attack/ambush in 'Aliens' (1986)? They have the heart rate monitors and helmet-cams and everything. I kept waiting for Corporal Hicks to yell, 'DRAKE, WE ARE LEAVING!!!'The aerial attack by the winged dinosaurs was outstanding. (I don't know the difference between pterodactyls and pteranodons. Besides, one of them looked like it had a T-Rex head, and I'm not sure that was even was a thing.) The plight of one plucked victim was pretty damn creative and horrifying — I think that entire sequence was an example of some pretty inspired horror filmmaking.And all of those things are good, because I honestly don't think this film has much going for it without them. This really is  pretty much the same story as 'Jurassic Park' (1993).Smart people do stupid things. I got a 'C' in biology freshman year, but even a guy like me immediately doubts the wisdom of the Raptor Recruiting Plan. I also have no military experience, but I know what 'cover' is, and I know what a 'kill zone' is, and I wouldn't rush from the former to stand stationary in the latter.Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas HowAboutADrinkLater are both very good actors; this movie's script has them rattling off humorous lines that are typical of a mediocre sitcom. The character concept for Pratt's hunky-extreme-sportsman-naturalist raptor-whisperer is kind of silly. Bryce Dallas HowDoYouJustKeepGettingPrettier plays another stock character — the two-dimensional uptight corporate princess who needs to be taken down a notch. Their banter is like the dialogue of a lackluster episode of 'Friends,' and it insults the viewers' intelligence.The movie's two most interesting characters are the two young brothers. Their dialogue was actually touching — this movie would be far better it had focused almost entirely on them. (And, yes, that is young Ty Simpkins from 'Insidious.')I keep seeing articles on the Internet alleging that the technology depicted by these movies will soon be possible, but I pretty much don't believe anything I read on the net anymore. Because I totally bought into that Mars One fiasco, and now I feel like an idjit.",8,3,16,15 June 2015
Logan," A review of 'Logan' (2017)
","I'm not sure I agree with quite all of the accolades that 'Logan' (2017) has been receiving. (It's being compared with Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight,' for example, as well as Frank Miller's medium-altering 1986 graphic novel, 'The Dark Knight Returns.') It's still a damn good movie, though, and easily among the best of Fox's 'X-Men' series. I'd give it a 9 out of 10, and I'd firmly recommend it.This absolutely doesn't feel like a 'comic book movie.' It feels more like a brutally violent, sometimes introspective, road-trip drama — though all of the comic book elements are still there. I'd caution comic book fans that 'Logan' was actually much darker than I expected — and, no, it wasn't just because of the visceral violence that could only be afforded by this movie's unusual 'R' rating. There was a lot more that went on here that got under my skin  I just can't say more for fear of spoilers.There is one thing I can tell you — there is none of the escapism of past 'X-Men' films. (C'mon, for being about a supposedly oppressed group, those movies always made being a mutant look fun as hell, and even glamorous.) This film follows an aging, ailing Wolverine, and an even worsely afflicted Professor X — subsisting in secret in the Mexico desert. What's more, they and their aging friend, Caliban, appear to be among the last of their kind, thanks to an unexplained, decades-long absence of new mutant births. And what little exposition is given about the other X-Men suggests that they are dead. If you've been a fan of these iconic characters for a long time, then seeing Wolverine and Professor X being so painfully not larger than life is jarring, and even sad. No matter what is the outcome of its story, this movie's plot setup alone can make an 'X- Men' fan a little despondent.The action is damned good. The movie surprised me by how smart it was, too. Its examination of violence and its consequences is unflinching. Also, we've been instructed through so many 'X-Men' movies that humans should not seek to contain the mutants out of fear  yet 'Logan' adroitly and subtly questions such one-sided moralizing. The acting, across the board, is extremely good — predictably from Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart, and surprisingly from 11-year-old Dafne Keen. She's perfect as the young, imperiled, yet ferocious Laura.My complaints with 'Logan' were minor. One thing that irked me was my own confusion about whether it was 'canon.' Are we to assume that this takes place in the 'X-Men' movies' 'main continuity?' Or is this a parallel universe or a different timeline? The feel of this film is so radically different that I found it difficult to imagine it following the previous films (although the post-credits sequence in 2016's 'X-Men: Apocalypse' seems to set up 'Logan.') I thought that this was based on Marvel Comics' 'Old Man Logan' storyline  wasn't that an alternate universe story?Maybe adding more to my confusion, 'X-Men' comic books actually exist in the universe of this film. Laura carries a bunch of them, and they are a minor plot point. Does this mean that the humans in this universe have finally accepted mutants, enough to create comic books about them being heroes? How did that come about?My second criticism of 'Logan' is that the character of Laura is thinly rendered. Saving her is the plot device for the entire film, and Keen is absolutely talented. Shouldn't we know more about her, and about her relationship with Logan and Charles?All in all, this was a superb film, though — with an unexpected tone and a surprisingly sober, risk-taking approach to Jackman's avowed last appearance as Wolverine. If you like the 'X-Men' movies at all, then you should definitely see it.",9,2,6,7 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Avengers Assemble  Again!!! (SPOILERS!)
","(WARNING: THIS POST CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR 'THE AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON.') Fun, fun, fun! Earth's Mightiest Heroes roar back onto the screen with nearly all of the action, humor and spectacle of the wonderful original — I would give 'The Avengers: Age of Ultron' (2015) a 9 out of 10.It's got everything that you could ask for in a superhero movie, including another great villain in the form of James Spader's 'Ultron,' beautifully animated by CGI. A surprise standout was Elizabeth Olsen as the Scarlet Witch. She's a great young actress whose work I really liked in 2011's terribly under-appreciated horror-thriller, 'Silent House.' She's got perfect line delivery. I'd love to see future Avengers films include her in the lineup, so that she can trade quips with Tony Stark.There's some great writing — the backstory for the twins was suitably dark, and was a perfect motive for a hatred of Stark. The banter might not be as funny as the first film, but was still quite good. And there's some nice thematic continuity with Marvel's planned 'Civil War' storyline.The movie falls short of perfection with the occasional misstep. For example, the flashbacks/hallucinations that various characters suffer were clumsy, overdone, and sometimes befuddling. Compare them with similar scenes in movies like '12 Monkeys' (1995) or 'Donnie Darko' (2001), or well made television shows like 'LOST.' Captain America's worst fear is some lame 'The war is over' existential bullshit? No. Cap is supposed to be the personification of freedom and democracy — his worst nightmare would be a totalitarian state. Or an undead Bucky. Or better yet, being a man out of time, it would be the loss of his friends, his family and his true love.A key conversation between two key characters at the end about mankind's future is just a little too depressing for an Avengers movie. Also a little sad? The suggestion that the team's lineup would change. Our existing roster is terrific — the fan's love 'em and I believe all the actors are under contract. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.Postscript: this movie is interesting because it shows the same superhero starring in competing film franchises. Aaron Taylor- Johnson's 'Quicksilver' is the very same Marvel Comics' speedster we see played (and scripted with much more fun) last year by Evan Peters in 'X-Men: Days of Future Past.' (There simply referred to as 'Maximoff,' for copyright considerations, I guess.)https://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/",9,1,7,1 May 2015
Mama," One scary 'Mama.'
","'Mama' (2013) was quite good; I'd give it an 8 out of 10. Jessica Chastain does a great job with a well written character arc — initially unlikable, but then a surprising heroine. And it's great that she got top billing, instead of the film's obligatory telegenic male protagonist, who actually spends a lot of time off-screen.Guillermo del Toro actually didn't direct this, as I thought — he was the executive producer. The director and screenwriter was Andrés Muschietti. But I swear this has the feel of del Toro's work. It could stand as a thematic sequel to the wonderful 'Don't Be Afraid of the Dark' remake, for example, which had strong elements of childhood fantasy and motherhood as a theme.And what a great and beautifully creepy use of CGI to render the title baddie. In fact, the whole movie was visually terrific, with a fairy-tale-ish use of movement and color that was cool, creative and different. There are really clever flourishes for fright-flick fans — I personally really liked the tug-of-war scene.I occasionally noticed some plot-convenient mysteries  one character is assaulted but survives? And 'Mama' can move with either lightning speed or plodding slowness, depending on what the story calls for. And  at one point  do we actually have a zombie? Do we need to call on Rick Grimes and his band of survivors from 'The Walking Dead?'This was fun. Check it out.https://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/",8,0,1,15 May 2015
Super 8," 'Super 8' (2011) was, as everyone told me, a good movie
","I'd give it an 8 out of 10. It had a smart, funny script that made for likable adolescent protagonists, some nice tension in setting up a sci-fi mystery, and some great special effects (including an impressive train crash that reminded me of the very different 'Final Destination' movies). I had fun with this.I can only enjoy 'family films' so much, though. It isn't that I need violence or sex to be entertained. It's that these movies are 'safe' and therefore predictable. When I realized early on that this was intended for general audiences, it gave me a pretty good idea of what would and would not happen throughout the film. (This film is a mystery that is a little hard to discuss without spoilers.)The movie was made even more predictable when you realize that director JJ Abrams was consciously imitating a certain other famous filmmaker. Let's look as what we've got: 1) an earnest, vulnerable, yet ultimately heroic adolescent boy; 2) quirky, flawed, yet lovable supporting characters that aid him in his quest; 3) a sci-fi mystery; 4) several family conflicts involving absent parents; and 5) ruthless government and/or military authorities.Hmmmm. Remind you of anything, anyone? Hint: see this film's producer.There was a little too much heavy handed imagery and plotting. Accidentally turning on a film projector and seeing a dead parent? A flying locket with a picture of said parent? And the locket is let go at the story's climax? I felt that Abrams would next reach right out of the movie screen and write the movie's message in black Sharpie marker across my forehead. Just in case I didn't get it.Still, this was good. Those kids were so damned cool it made me think it might be fun to be a parent. That heavy kid would actually be really cool to hang out with. If I were his Dad, I'd buy him all sorts of stuff for his hobby of making zombie movies, and I'd let him skip his chores just to give him the space he needs.This movie also did something pretty creative that I don't remember seeing done outside of 'The X-Files.' We're shown a government or military conspiracy, but this time the local police department does NOT cooperate or become complicit in it. So you see local cops actively working against their federal or military counterparts. I found that to be different and interesting, and it seems like the sort of thing that might occur in real life.All in all, this was a good movie. It seems like a pretty decent flick with which to introduce a kid to science fiction.https://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/",8,0,2,28 April 2015
Sinister," It's easy to see why 'Sinister' (2012) came so highly recommended; this is a startlingly scary horror movie.
","It's easy to see why 'Sinister' (2012) came so highly recommended; this is a startlingly scary horror movie to which I'd give an 8 out of 10. I was tempted to give it a 9, but some subjective personal tastes prevent me from giving this unusually disturbing film a higher rating.It's frightening. The design of the supernatural Big Bad is quite good, despite its simplicity. This film succeeds in giving us an intimidating bogeyman. Far worse is his choice of victims and his modus operandi. I won't say much here this is a movie where we learn about the story's antagonist because the protagonist is an investigator — true-crime writer 'Ellison Oswalt,' wonderfully played by Ethan Hawke. I also won't go into precisely how the baddie operates, because it's just a little too dark to contemplate here.It's shot and scripted quite well there are a number of nice touches, and the basic story is unsettling even by horror movie standards. A late twist about how the violence is perpetrated is telegraphed in advance, but it still gets under your skin. The directing by Scott Derrickson is spot on — the 'jump moments' are cheap, but they still work. Derrickson's and C. Robert Cargill's script is smartly unnerving — especially with respect to how these crimes are perpetrated. (Yeesh.) And the use of unusual and disturbing music is quite effective. This film was the result of a lot of thought and effort.Still, a few things suggested to me that this falls short of being a perfect horror movie:1) Common tropes abound. The most tired, to me, was the use of a horror writer as an ironic protagonist. That's an overused device. The master himself, Stephen King, for example, has used this in no fewer than four novels and their subsequent film treatments, by my count. (Yes, Hawke here is a nonfiction writer instead of a novelist, but the principle is the same.) 2) Hawke's protagonist, as scripted, is pretty damned unlikable. 'Deputy So-and-So' is his most important source, not to mention someone who shows him compassion when things get really tough. Yet he sticks with that insulting appellation, and even screens his calls, throughout the entire movie. 3) The bestselling nonfiction writer here has no idea how to cultivate a source. (See above.) I've been a writer, in some capacity, for my entire adult life, and I started out as a paper jockey. You treat every source as important, even the crazy ones. It's both good manners and proper professional conduct. And when you deal with any police officer, you're especially conscientious if you're smart — people in law enforcement are often (understandably) very sensitive about how they are portrayed in writing. 4) Ellison the need to move into a home where a multiple homicide was committed, in order to write about the crime? That's just nuts, even by eccentric writer standards. 5) He chooses not to tell his wife? I have never been married, but I know from both my personal and professional life that women get really, really ticked off when you neglect to tell them things that they think are important. 6) Is Oswalt's wife a Luddite who never googles anything? I moved to Virginia a year ago, and I STILL google my address because I keep forgetting my zip code. 7) Oswalt expects no neighbors to share such information with his wife? (This is lampshaded a bit, as a child brings home the information from his school.) Finally, there is one subjective matter that kept me from loving this movie — and it is admittedly a matter of taste. Even as a devoted lover of dark stories, my enjoyment is sometimes affected by films in which children are victimized. (I am referring here to the children depicted in the 8 MM ('Super 8″) film strips that are discovered by the main character.)Yes, these are horror movies, and they are intended for adults, and we ourselves should be adult enough to recognize fiction as such. (Otherwise we can buy a different ticket or click elsewhere among Netflix' options.) And plenty of great horror films feature imperiled children. '28 Weeks Later' (2007) immediately springs to mind for me, probably because it is a favorite. I think most other genre devotees would point to the universally recognized 'The Exorcist' (1973). But in those films and most others, things were depicted differently. (I'm being vague here for fear of spoilers all around.)I'm a veteran horror-hound; I've routinely enjoyed films in which zombies or vampires wipe out humanity. But what I saw in 'Sinister' was too dark even for my taste. This sort of reaction is rare on my part, but not unprecedented. 'The Devil's Rejects' (2005) and 'Wolf Creek' (2005) both took violence against the innocent too far for me to really enjoy or recommend them. (Strangely, 1980's legendary 'Cannibal Holocaust' affected me little.) Yes, zombie apocalypses tend to be gory affairs, but they are almost always faced by grownups, who are unbound, and armed, and generally able to fight back.I would really think twice recommending this to the casual film-goer without a spoilerish hint about its content. Your mileage may vary.Hey if you really want a scary story, check out The Internet Movie Database's trivia section for 'Sinister' after you see the movie. Read how the 'Pool Party' scene was filmed. That's that's nuts. Nobody wants a director that committed. Somebody should have called OSHA. Seriously.And here's a joke for you. Given the 'Super 8″ films we see in this movie, wouldn't it be blackly funny if this film were sequel to Steven Spielberg's heartwarming 'Super 8″ (2011)? It's all about the kids, right?",8,2,3,10 August 2015
A Beautiful Mind," I finally saw 'A Beautiful Mind' (2001), and I really liked it.
","It had a fantastic script with great performances by Russell Crowe, Ed Harris, Jennifer Connelly, Christopher Plummer, Paul Bettany and Adam Goldberg. I'd give it a 9 out of 10.I had no idea that Crowe was this good of an actor. He had a 'Rain Man' role in this film, in which an established actor can show his range by portraying a mentally ill person. Yet even his terrific performance here was maybe outshined by Harris'. I don't know what it is about Harris  but he grows on you. He's a great actor, even in a somewhat one-note role like the one he has here. He can be forceful and intimidating, and even genuinely frightening, but also sympathetic at the same time. (See his performances in 'The Stand' miniseries (1994) or that Saturday-afternoon, guilty-pleasure standby, 'The Rock' (1996).) Plus he's just got a damned cool voice. And those crazy-ass eyes that bore right through you. Seriously, if Ed Harris were your Dad, would you ever f%#@ up as a teenager? Ever? I would never come home late with beer on my breath, EVEN IF ED HARRIS WERE AN OUT-OF-STATE UNCLE.Ron Howard's directing was good – very good. Still, I couldn't help comparing him with other directors who have a genius for this kind of source material. This is a movie where the main character comes to doubt his perceptions of reality – when I think of films like '12 Monkeys,' 'Vanilla Sky' or 'Jacob's Ladder,' I couldn't help but wonder if their directors really would have given a tour de force with this story's fantastic elements. Think about it  if Terry Gilliam had directed 'A Beautiful Mind,' wouldn't this great movie be even better?All in all, though, this was an excellent film. I cheerfully recommend it.",9,1,2,3 October 2014
The Witch," I  think I understand it. I just didn't like it much.
","I've read that renowned horror author Brian Keene criticized the popular audience backlash against 2015's 'The Witch,' saying that '90 percent of the people in the theater  will be too stupid to understand' it. Well, maybe I am among the stupid 90 percent. I'd name this movie as the most disappointing horror film in recent memory, and I'd rate it a 2 out of 10.I  think I understand it. I just didn't like it much. It is alternately boring and sad. It is boring far more often than it is sad. When it is sad, it isn't the cathartic, meaningful, artistic 'sad.' It's just kind of a grimace-inducing downer. There are problems with pacing, tension and story structure. The movie only gets interesting during its closing several minutes.These problems, however, are overshadowed by the movie's biggest flaw — most of the (literal) Puritans populating this period story are so unlikable that you'd care little about what happens to them. They are verbosely, tiresomely God-obsessed. I myself might strike a deal with the devil if he'd silence the two creepy tots, and maybe the shrewish, hysterically shrill mother (Kate Dickie), too. He wouldn't have to kill them or anything — muting them would suffice.Yes, the film does succeed somewhat in establishing mood and tone. But the result is still nothing to write home about. This isn't 'It Follows' (2014).The film has two things going for it. One, as other reviewers have noted, it achieves authenticity quite well. The sets, costumes and dialogue were so meticulously developed that I actually did believe we were in 17th Century New England. Two, Anya-Taylor Joy wonderfully performs the role of young Tomasina.Those two things do not redeem the film, however. I'd skip this.",2,3,8,31 May 2016
Kong: Skull Island," A few quick words on 'Kong: Skull Island' (2017).
","'Kong: Skull Island' doesn't have the charm and sense of fun of Peter Jackson's version, but it's still a first-rate monster movie that I highly recommend. It's got a good script, likable characters and terrific special effects.Parts of it were actually scary. The first action set-piece is unexpectedly brutal, and there's a sequence with a giant spider that was a little unnerving, too. I was surprised at how the filmmakers here so heavily emphasized the story's action-horror elements.I had a blast with this, and I'd give it a 9 out of 10.I have a question -- did anyone else notice a reference to 'Jurassic Park' (1993)? At one point, Samuel Jackson's character tells his companions to 'Hang on to your butts.' Isn't that his character's line in 'Jurassic Park' when he restores power to the facility, shortly before he gets killed?",9,4,7,27 March 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," A very short review of 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies' (2014)
","I think that 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies' (2014) is the best of Peter Jackson's prequel trilogy, and not only because of its predictably terrific climactic battle. I'd give this movie a 9 out of 10.First, it's less cartoonish and far more adult than its predecessors, in everything from its themes to its fight choreography. (Compare the beautifully staged final melees here, for example, with that Warner Brothers-esque sequence in the second film, in which the dwarfs dance across barrels and river rapids to repel their orc pursuers.)It also seems like a better peek at a larger fantasy universe, with different races, armies and cultures working at cross purposes before needing to align, and with more than one protagonist's real failings factoring in to that.And  HOT DAMN! That's GOTTA be the greatest depiction of a dragon I've ever seen. One small quibble I've had throughout all of Jackson' Tolkien films was that the stories' antagonists sometimes seemed too silly and clownish to be truly menacing. (The orcs, trolls and goblins seemed cartoonish and are too easily defeated by beings sometimes half their height; only the Nazguls and the Uruk- Hai hybrids managed to impress.) Jackson's depiction of Smaug ravaging Laketown makes dragons look like Middle Earth's equivalent of a goddam nuclear device.",9,5,8,29 September 2015
Arrival," A very short review of 'Arrival' (2016)
","'Arrival' (2016) is an unusually smart and thought-provoking science fiction film. It isn't really intended by its creators as a 'twist movie,' but it does include an unexpected component that should surprise and challenge the viewer. (I don't want to say more about it, for fear of spoilers.)Amy Adams actually is a terrific actress, and she seems to do well in understated roles that require her to be thoughtful and deliberate. (Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker are both quite good too, even if they seem confined to roles here that don't require much range.)One caveat — this isn't a standard science fiction thriller. (Although 'Arrival' has some decent suspense, I'm inclined to think that this shouldn't be considered a thriller at all.) I do think that viewers expecting a more mainstream film will be disappointed with this story conclusion's more subdued and unconventional payoff. (Again, I just can't say more here.)I'd rate this an 8 out of 10; and I would recommend it to science fiction fans.",8,1,5,26 February 2017
The Conjuring," A review of 'The Conjuring' (2013)
","I feel the same way about 'The Conjuring' (2013) as I did about its prequel, 'Annabelle' (2014) — it has all the earmarks of a bad movie, but it inexplicably succeeds anyway.Seriously — this film has clunky exposition, cheesy dialogue and over-the-top plot developments (toward the end), not to mention a plot setup that's in questionable taste. (The movie suggests that the innocents condemned by the infamous 1692 Salem witch trials were indeed witches. This feels a bit awkward to anyone who read Arthur Miller's 'The Crucible' in high school.) 'The Conjuring' also plays out like a love letter to Ed and Lorraine Warren, the controversial paranormal investigators who are largely the subject of the film (played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga). This last offense is forgivable, I suppose — the film was made with the Warrens' blessing, and Lorraine Warren was even present as a 'consultant' during its production.Strangely, however, these flaws were barely noticeable to me when I watched it. I had a good time. 'The Conjuring' just happens to be a decent fright flick that delivers on the scares.I think James Wan's skilled directing has a lot to do with that; the film works visually. (I could name specific instances where it works especially well, but I want to avoid spoilers.)The acting helped a lot too — Wilson and Farmiga are both damned good, as is Lili Taylor as the afflicted family's mother. (I've admired Taylor's acting since her long ago 1998 guest appearance on 'The X-Files,' and she was equally good as a bad guy in 1996's 'Ransom.') Ron Livingston was also quite good in the role of the father — if you have trouble placing his face, as I did, he also played Captain Nixon in HBO's 'Band of Brothers' (2001). He seems to have a talent for playing the likable everyman — he's great here as the somewhat feckless father, and functions well as a kind of viewer surrogate. I should also mention the young Joey King as one of the family's daughters — she played the role of a terrified child to perfection, and really raised the stakes emotionally.Despite really enjoying most of the movie, some of my enthusiasm for 'The Conjuring' flagged a bit toward the end. The denouement here includes an exorcism, and those are almost always boring. There are only so many ways that scenario can play out, and we've seen them all — and I shouldn't even need to name that certain 1973 film that did it best. Furthermore, we see our story's demon do some pretty extraordinary things, even by demon standards. It can apparently transport itself great distances (using an inanimate object as a kind of fax machine?), and can manipulate both the laws of physics and the area's wildlife. It was all a little too much for my willing suspension of disbelief.Again, though — this was a good movie. I'd give it an 8 out of 10, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good scare.",8,0,0,22 April 2017
The Wolverine," Wolverine does not practice safe sex.
","Think about it. He suffers from chronic nightmares, awakens in a panic attack, and then gets all stabbity-stabbity towards whichever woman happens to be closest to his bed. We saw this in 'The X-Men' (2000), but thankfully Rogue's plot convenient powers saved her. No mention is made of this to Mariko in 'The Wolverine' (2013). Should he be  kinda sorta responsible for informing any women he spends the night with about his sleep disorder?Anyway,I didn't despise this movie the way so many others did, but my response was somewhat tepid for a lifelong fan of the character.I understand what the filmmakers were trying to do with 'The Wolverine' – I really do. They were trying to make an X-Men movie with less flash and more substance. And it was a good plan – taking a 'gritty' and clichéd dark character and humanizing him with a lot of introspective character study. Which should have been the ingredients for a great movie.This was an average film, though – I'd give it a 7 out of 10. For one, it was a bit slow and chatty at times for an 'X Men' movie. For another, some of the action sequences and villains were just too cheesy. Silver Samurai reminded me constantly of the 1980's 'Voltron' cartoon, and Viper was really just a poor man's Poison Ivy with unimpressive powers.This movie does do a really nice job in upgrading an old action movie trope – fighting on the roof of a moving train. That was fun.Can anyone explain to me how Wolverine got his claws back? How the hell did that happen?!Also  is he mortal now? That would explain the 'older' Wolverine we see in the posters for 'X-Men: Days of Future Past.'",7,1,3,29 May 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," Dear Lord, 'The Dark Knight Rises' (2012) was fantastic.
","his third and final installment to Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy, at several times, wanted to make me stand up and cheer.This film deserves a perfect 10. All of the magic of 'Batman Begins' (2005) and 'The Dark Knight' (2008) return – especially with respect to an excellent script with a layered, detailed plot and great, three-dimensional characters. I found myself seeing parallels between this movie and another current popular comic book adaptation, AMC's 'The Walking Dead.' Both seem to have expertly taken the best elements from the comics, but then also changed or updated the source material to enhance it and surprise longtime fans. And there's a great continuity with the preceding films in terms of characters, themes, motif and story.The dialogue was wonderful; this is a quotable movie. And the basic story is perfect, especially in the way this film was challenged to follow up the amazing 'Dark Knight.' They made some wise choices. Instead of trying to match Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker, Nolan simply presents us with a new kind of 'Bat-villain' — Bane, a supremely logical and ordered personality whose background seems very similar to Bruce Wayne's. I was a Batman comic book fan in the early 1990's, when Bane was created. He remains one of my all-time favorite villains, along with Randall Flagg, Two-Face, (Matt Wagner's) Grendel, and Hannibal Lecter. Nolan seized the compelling original character (created, I believe, by writer Chuck Dixon), and truly capitalized on it.So too, did Nolan capitalize on the great character of Selina Kyle as Catwoman (again best characterized in the original comic by Dixon). She was wonderfully played by a runaway performance by Anne Hathaway, and she really does deserve her own movie.The acting was wonderful all around (even though Tom Hardy doubtlessly was challenged as an actor by a mask that obscured his face). Hathaway, was a terrific surprise, and Gary Oldman and Michael Caine were awesome as always. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Marion Cotillard did just great in their supporting roles, especially with some character aspects and choices that viewers might not have expected. I've criticized Christian Bale's acting in the past  but here I thought he was at his best in the trilogy.By the end of the movie, the two quibbles I had were extremely minor. One, we see various supporting characters use high-tech military vehicles that would seem to require at least some training. (You and I cannot simply hop into a tank and know how to use it.)Two, by the end of the movie, Bane is not quite the iconic character I remember from the comics. He seemed upstaged by certain other characters. But I'm a nerd, and Bane is a favorite, so  really? There's probably no pleasing me, anyway.Seriously, though, THANK YOU CHRISTOPHER NOLAN.http://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/",10,3,7,8 October 2014
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Batman vs. Superman vs. a Terrible Script
","Wow. The script for 'Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice' (2016) was really bad.I hate to begin a review with a statement so negative, but it's true. I really think that I could have done better than this, and I know nothing about screen writing. Hell, parts of the movie were actually MSTy-worthy. I just can't believe that the gifted David S. Goyer had a hand in this.Batman is flatly rendered and barely likable. Superman is capably played by Henry Cavill, but has little to say. Lex Luthor is portrayed as a cloying, verbose, flamboyant, attention-seeking manchild. He gets all the screen time in the world (and more dialogue than Superman, it seems), and he really come across as a whiny, rambling high school student playing at theologian, trying in vain to impress the girls. Luthor seems to want to ingratiate himself to every other character on screen. Strangely, this includes even those he is threatening or endeavoring to murder. He has weird vocal tics that quickly get on our nerves. 'Mmm.' He makes repeated references to god, who he hates, and  this makes him hate the godlike Superman, via Freudian transference. Or something.He consequently wants to kill Superman. He has kryptonite and demonstrably capable mercenaries at his disposal. But, for some reason, he wants to employ unreliable, convoluted plans to prompt Batman to do it. His plans to motivate Batman include harassing him with newspaper clippings and nasty notes, like a deranged stalker.He also has a photograph of Wonder Woman that she would like to keep secret. She goes ahead and mentions it to an ostensibly drunken Bruce Wayne at a party anyway.Oh! Luthor also knows the secret identities for both Superman and Batman, and has known for some time. We don't find out how he knows, and he does far less to exploit this information than you would think. Couldn't he easily (and quite legally) cause problems for both men simply by exposing them? Superman knows Batman's identity too; I guess we can chalk that up to his x-ray vision? Batman is not in the know, and spends much of the movie trying to play catch-up, and is easily manipulated by Luthor. This is despite the fact that, in the comics, he is the world's greatest detective.There is bad dialogue, weird science, and bad science. There are murky, vague plot points and unsupported character motivations. Some things are just plain dumb — Metropolis and Gotham City stand within sight of each other, just across a bay. Either hero could easily intervene in the other's city  but they apparently respect each other's nearly adjacent turf, even though they don't know or trust each other.Even the premise is shaky — legions of people hate Superman because they blame him for the damage inflicted by Zod during the events of 'Man of Steel' (2013). Couldn't he just exonerate himself by simply telling the truth — that Zod attacked earth and he rose to defend it? I'm willing to bet most people would get that.There are  dream sequences  and/or visions  and/or messages from the future? And  conversations with the dead? Or  not? You tell me.Why does Superman need a winter jacket?Why does he refer to his mother as 'Martha?' Do any of us refer to our mothers by their first name?I could go on, but you get the idea. I actually found my attention wandering during this movie.All of this is a shame, because there are hints of brilliance hiding among the mediocrity. The movie is ambitious. It seems to want to say a lot about weighty themes such as power, unlimited power, its ability to corrupt, and the unintended consequences of unilateral action. There seem to be visual references to real world horrors like 9/11 and ISIS' terrorism, which I found pretty bold. I've never been good with subtext. Were there allegories here that I missed, connected with U.S. foreign policy or the War on Terror?I will say this — the film isn't quite as bad as the critics are making it out to be. It isn't all garbage, it's just a below average superhero film. And it appears worse because it's part of a genre characterized by a lot of really good films — Christopher Nolan's Batman movies were groundbreaking, and most of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's titles were quite good. So this ambitious misfire seems far worse in contrast. I myself would rate this movie a 5 out of 10 — even if I might be biased here by my lifelong love for these iconic characters.",5,1,2,1 April 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," My spoiler-free review of 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' (2015)
","This review of 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' will be necessarily brief, for fear of spoilers. And when I say 'fear of spoilers,' I really do mean FEAR of spoilers. There are people out there who will burn your house down if you ruin this long-awaited film's surprises.I really liked it. I would somewhat grudgingly give it a 9 out of 10, as I can't match the sheer ardor its global legions of fans. (Yes, 'Star Wars' was a big part of my childhood, but I have more or less gotten over it. I read last night, for example, that filmmaker Kevin Smith actually cried upon stepping aboard the Millennium Falcon when he visited the set; I am not quite as nostalgic as that.)In short, it absolutely succeeds as a fun space fantasy, and recaptures the spirit of the original 'Holy Trilogy.' It easily surpasses the much-maligned prequels on nearly every level, including screen writing, acting and special effects. The predominance of practical effects over those that are exclusively digital make this movie's universe feel 'real' and 'lived in.'We finally have relatable characters again who sound real, and who can invite viewer sympathy. The dramatic interaction among our newer heroes and returning icons is both logical and emotionally involving. I was surprised at how well this movie handled the passing of the torch. It was a kind of skilled storytelling that was almost entirely absent from the last three films. And the special effects were top notch.My only mild quibbles might reflect a greater degree of objectivity that you might hear from someone who is not a raging fan of the series. This film so closely parallels the original 'Star Wars' (1978) that at times it started to feel like a remake. Were the similarities in structure, characters, plot points, planets and villains all an intentional homage? I suggest that our bad guys here, for example, sometimes feel interchangeable with those of past 'Star Wars' films. I want to say more, but can't, because of spoilers. Am I the only person who noticed these things?I also submit that, like a few other 'Star Wars' movies, our characters are rendered with little depth, with sparse information about their skills, motivations, backgrounds or ideosyncrasies. The dialogue is thin. Consider lines like 'He's my friend!' and 'Because it's the right thing to do.' And we are presented with no information why the speaker here is so noble, when others are not. Even if the screen writing here is better than the prequels, it's still not Tennessee Williams.It's all very forgivable, I guess, just so long as the viewer remembers that they're sitting down to an installment in a film franchise originally intended for young people. It's kid stuff. It's really, really good kid stuff, but it's kid stuff. (Don't burn my house down!)And the reason I chose a 9 rating instead of an 8 was primarily the enjoyment I got from seeing familiar faces. The return of our icons was surprisingly well depicted and, if you loved 'Star Wars' as a kid, then that should be enough to make this a 'must-see' movie.",9,5,24,28 December 2015
Godzilla," A brief review of 'Godzilla' (2014)
","I liked it! It's no 'Blade Runner,' but it's a fun way to escape a rainy Saturday.There is a lot of fun fan service for those who remember the original movies. For one, the creature design isn't 'Jurassic Park' — it deliberately recalls the man-in-the-rubber-suit effects of the Japanese films. And they made sure to include that impossible to forget (or write) REEEEEEEIIIIAAAAAAARRRGH.I might be imagining things, but I'm pretty sure the baddies here are deliberately reminiscent of 'Cloverfield' (2008). That was funny.There is a long and overwrought subplot monopolizing the first half of the film, involving a bereaved Bryan Cranston. Whatever this was meant to achieve in terms of character motivations, it kinda wasn't worth it to delay the arrival of giant monsters. I'm pretty sure that people don't go to a Godzilla movie to see Bryan Cranston.Actually  I take that back. That dude is so popular that it's entirely possible that people do go to a Godzilla movie to see Bryan Cranston.http://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/",Null,1,2,6 July 2014
Life," 'Life's' a bitch.
","Or at least it is to the astronauts who make an abortive attempt to escort it back to Earth. (They realize that bringing a Martian organism home is a bad idea in this year's surprisingly satisfying science fiction-thriller.)I actually had more fun with this than I expected; the movie is much faster paced and scarier than the trailer made it look. There are some real surprises and moments of genuine horror here, following a requisite plot setup that is relatively brief. It's a really nice monster movie that should please fans of the genre.I actually didn't prefer its ending, which is something for which other reviewers are praising it a lot. I'm disinclined to say more, for fear of spoilers. The movie's marketing already spoiled enough. (The ads infuriatingly show the fate of a main character.)I will say what the movie is not, however.One, it's not a stealth prequel for Sony's planned 2018 'Spider-Man' spin off, 'Venom' (though that's such a clever idea, I wish I'd thought of it).Two, it's not a ripoff of Ridley Scott's 'Alien' (1979). Yes, it's got the same MacGuffin, and some story parallels that I noticed early on. But I like to think of this as a more grounded contemporary thriller, where 'Alien' was a futuristic fantasy creature feature. Besides, if we criticize every 'haunted-house-in- space' movie as an 'Alien' imitator, we won't get more of them.I'd give this an 8 out of 10, and I'd recommend it.",8,2,8,30 March 2017
Deadpool," It helps to bear in mind this movie's real purpose — fan service for the infamous niche character's evident legions of followers.
","I've never read a single 'Deadpool' comic book, but that didn't stop me from enjoying the movie. It's a fun, creative and  unconventional entry into the 'X-Men' film franchise that actually made me laugh out loud a few times. I'd give it an 8 out of 10.It isn't high art. It's got a thin story based on a rickety plot device, nearly no exposition, and it includes some cartoonish action that I thought was just too over the top, even by comic book movie standards. (Our hero dodges bullets and survives a stab to the brain.)It helps to bear in mind this movie's real purpose — fan service for the infamous niche character's evident legions of followers. 'Deadpool' isn't meant to be densely plotted, like 'X2: X-Men United' (2003), or genuinely cinematic, like the Christopher Nolan 'Batman' films. It's a long awaited, R-rated feature film to please loyal fans of this profane, adult-oriented antihero, who would be out of place and necessarily bowlderized in a mainstream superhero- teamup flick. (And I kinda get that — I loved the 'Wolverine' comics when I was a kid, and, trust me, his film incarnation is tame compared to its source material.)'Deadpool' is damn funny. The movie succeeds by making us laugh. And combining a raunchy comedy with an 'X-Men' film gives it a weird, cool, subversive vibe. It makes you wonder if Stan Lee would approve of this sort of thing  until you see Lee himself in a cameo at the story's strip bar. It's fun to know that dirty jokes indeed do exist within the 'X-Men' movie universe.The lowbrow jokes made me cringe one or twice ('baby hand.') But you've got to give the movie credit for delivering its bathroom-wall humor if that's what the original character is about. (Are the comics like this?) Ryan Reynolds is genuinely funny, and his deadpan delivery is perfect. The film might not have even worked at all with out him.By the way, this movie actually reminded me a hell of a lot of a long-ago flick that I absolutely loved, but which I'm guessing is largely forgotten — Andrew Dice Clay's 'The Adventures of Ford Fairlane' (1990). That movie also had a foulmouthed, lone, maverick antihero who often broke the fourth wall, and that also made me laugh like hell. I know it sounds like a strange comparison, but they're very similar films.Finally, I'd like to think that the Wade Wilson we see here actually IS a version of the Wade Wilson that we first met in the widely lamented 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' (2009). (And how can he not be, if that movie is canon?) If 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' (2014) rebooted the timeline, then the Deadpool we're rooting for here was never recruited, corrupted and experimented upon by William Stryker. So you can have your cake and eat it, too.",8,2,11,6 March 2016
The Cabin in the Woods," The fantastic 'The Cabin in the Woods' (2012) is a surprise-filled movie that is difficult to review without spoilers ...
","... so I can't say much about it. Suffice to say, I really, really liked it – I'd give it a 9 out of 10.This is a smart, inventive film that is probably the most creative thing I've seen in a long time – it's safe to say that I've never seen anything like it. Do yourself a favor and avoid news articles or websites like IMDb.com – you'll enjoy this much more if you know little about it.It actually takes a while to get going. I had a lukewarm response to this movie for maybe its entire first half. The end — which brings together a surprising number of story elements (I really can't say more) – really redeemed it. The buildup to that ending is a lot of things that have long been established as horror clichés. But that's intentional, as screenwriter Drew Goddard and producer Joss Whedon made it, I think, partly as a parody and partly as an homage to the genre.A few caveats  if you've been looking forward to this movie for a while, as I have, you're aware that it was very well reviewed. But I'm pretty sure it got so much praise because it was creative and original – not because it was the best HORROR movie ever made. The central plot device is too contrived and fantastic to be really frightening, and the movie is too self-aware to allow us to forget it's just a movie. Parts of it were disturbing, but there's just too much humor to make this a truly scary movie. You're not sitting down to 'The Exorcist' or 'The Shining.'Also, various reviews seem to indicate a twist that is impossible to guess. This isn't true. Horror fans – especially fans of a certain subgenre – will know the big reveal before the halfway mark, especially if they listen to the dialogue of the story's antagonists. Hell, I was just talking about it with another aspiring horror writer just the other day. Don't expect a surprise on the level of 'The Sixth Sense' or 'Unbreakable.'Still, this was a hell of a lot of fun. And what a GREAT Halloween movie it would make!! It would also be fun to watch back-to-back with 'Cabin Fever' or one of the 'Evil Dead' movies, given their similar settings.http://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/",9,0,2,4 October 2014
Spectre," A very short review of 'Spectre' (2015)
","(THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THE FILM.) 'Spectre' (2015) was an impressive James Bond film, if not an unforgettable one. I'd rate it an 8 out of 10. It's got style, terrific action sequences and absolutely gorgeous shooting locations. Daniel Craig is still a decent Bond, too, even if I always find him a little understated in the role. And Dave Bautista makes a sufficiently intimidating henchman. (The man looks gigantic, too.)It brings little new to the franchise, however, and it doesn't rise above being a standard action film in the same manner as its predecessor, 2012's nuanced and surprisingly emotional 'Skyfall.' (I've gained a greater appreciation for that movie after having watched it a second time.)It occurs to me, too, that 'Spectre' seems a little easy to nitpick — at least to someone who's enjoyed a lot of spy films and novels that are intended as procedural thrillers. We watch Bond gain easy access to a super-secret meeting of the titular cabal, for instance — he just kinda bluffs his way in. Then the organization's Big Bad calls him out, after apparently feeling his presence, as Darth Vader felt the presence of Luke on a passing ship in 'Return of the Jedi' (1983). Later, we watch Bond employ incredibly risky and haphazard tactics to rescue a kidnap victim — it seems to me that the consequent random vehicle crashes, explosions and gunshots could just as easily kill her as they might free her.Still, this was a fun movie. I'd recommend it if you're looking for an enjoyable action flick.",8,1,2,9 November 2017
Mad Max: Fury Road," This is like a modern 'Ben Hur' (1959) on acid.
","Dear Lord, Charlize Theron is a fantastic actress. It's amazing what she can communicate with just her facial expressions and line delivery, even when her dialogue is sparing and simplistic. She's also a superb physical actress, has great scene presence and is stunningly beautiful. Why not simply call this movie 'Furiosa?' It's really that character's story; the titular 'Mad Max' says and does little that is plot-relevant. He is a superfluous character who is here only to attract the fanbase for the original 'Mad Max' movies.Theron is one of two things that 'Mad Max: Fury Road' has going for it. The other is pure spectacle. I don't love this movie the way that everyone else seems to (I'd give it a 7 out of 10), but I really did enjoy the action, special effects, costume, prop and set design. This is like a modern 'Ben Hur' (1959) on acid — the characters, weapons, sets and vehicles look great. This movie is like a really good heavy metal album cover made into a feature- length film.My attention wandered, though. The action is often difficult to follow, thanks to too much Michael Bay-type directing. Tom Hardy is really just a one-note character as Max, despite efforts to render him in depth with cliché flashbacks of a lost family. And I liked this guy a hell of a lot in 'The Dark Knight Rises' (2012); I thought he made the masked Bane a great villain with physical acting that compensated well for an obscured face.I submit that this is a somewhat brainless movie that barely qualifies as science fiction. We have a sparse opening montage that tells us about world-ending wars for resources, and then the rest of the movie is really just an extended gladiator battle in the desert with baroquely costumed bad guys. It's like a monster truck rally.It's sometimes fun, but it doesn't make a great film. The good guys are too thinly drawn to engender viewer sympathy; the bad guys are too cartoonish to be scary. You also need to turn your brain off, lest certain questions occur to you:1) Doesn't gasoline degrade over time? I don't think it would be worth warring or bartering for after a year or so, unless there are oil rigs and complex refineries to seek and develop it. We see evidence of neither.2) What do people eat, out here in the never-ending desert? The disappearance of 'green places' is a plot point; there is no arable land.3) How often does this dictator ('Big Joe' or something?) give his subjects water? Once per day? I thought dehydration killed or immobilized people fairly quickly.4) Where the heck are we? I hear a lot of United Kingdom accents.5) I'm pretty sure that blood transfusions don't work like that. And even if they did, you'd see a hell of a lot of opportunistic infections in such unsterile conditions.6) Why does one young woman immediately fall in love with a sleeping barbarian whose teeth are spray-painted silver?Whatever. I'm not saying that this is a bad movie; I'm just suggesting that it's a little overrated given its current accolades by fans. It's fun enough, if you're in the mood for a 'Mad Max' movie.",7,0,7,17 June 2015
Alien: Covenant," 'Alien: Covenant' (2017) is a first-rate sci-fi horror show with lots of monstery goodness.
","I am part of a happy minority where 'Alien Covenant' (2017) is concerned — I keep hearing about 'meh' or negative reactions from my friends, but I quite enjoyed it. I'd rate it a 9 out of 10.No, this second installment in the 'Alien' prequel trilogy doesn't bring much new to the table. It often seems like a collection of common tropes, and borrows a bit from previous films in the franchise — especially the first movie in 1979. Some aspects of it — like a predictable and slightly gimmicky development late in the story — even feel like horror movie clichés. (I am doing everything I can to avoid spoilers, so forgive how vague I'm being here.) 'Alien: Covenant' isn't groundbreaking, and it isn't destined to be called a 'classic.'Here's the thing, though — all of the movie's common tropes are exactly what make fans happy. Think about it  if you had to name two 'Alien' movies as unique or the most divergent, they might be the heady, ambitious 'Prometheus' (2012) and the baroquely experimental 'Alien: Resurrection' (1997). Whatever their failings, both of those movies deserve points for creativity. And they are among the three films that fans hated the most. (The third here is the smartest and most under-appreciated installment, 1993's brilliant 'Alien 3.')With 'Alien: Covenant,' Ridley Scott gives fans exactly what they were clamoring for — a frightening, gory, space-based horror film with creatively designed monsters and some nasty surprises. It very much returns to the tone of the first film. It is even jarringly darker than 'Prometheus,' which was defined partly by its moments of cautious optimism. And, more than any other sequel, it seems directly inspired by the grotesquerie of H. R. Giger's original, nightmarish monster designs. I feel certain this movie would have received the late artist's blessing. (I could name a certain scene and an excellent surprise story development, but I won't.)Michael Fassbender shined in his two roles here. (He not only reprises his role as the android, 'David,' but also portrays a newer model, 'Walter.') The rest of the acting was roundly good too.I also found the movie nice and scary. I, for one, don't think Scott's direction of action scenes here is perfect. (They are harder to follow here, for example, than his beautiful arena melees in 2000's 'Gladiator.') But they were still effective.So this return to form made me pretty happy. I didn't want another muddled attempt at profundity like 'Prometheus.' Nor did I want a winding, bizarre, art-house-horror tale like 'Resurrection' — that movie was like a poorly written, drug-fueled comic book. I wanted a first-rate sci-fi horror show with lots of monstery goodness, and that's what I got.If I had to pick a criticism of 'Alien: Covenant,' I'm surprised to have to point to some less-than-stellar CGI. This was something I noticed from early trailers for the film, and I'm surprised I haven't heard another reviewer mention in it yet. One scene rendered a title baddie about as well as a modern video game, albeit a good one. Another's depiction of an upright 'neomorph' seemed  fairly bad. (Fans of decent creature features shouldn't despair, however — there are still some outstanding monster moments, and no small amount of accompanying gore and goo.) Have I just become spoiled by the amazing dinosaur effects of 2015's 'Jurassic World?' I don't think so  I suggest that the otherwise lamentable 'Alien: Resurrection,' with its combination of CGI and practical effects, had far better creature effects than this newest outing.Of course I recommend this movie. Maybe I should only do so with the caveat that I am (obviously) a huge fan of the series. It has been said that I'm easy to please, too — I actually gave a glowing review to 'Prometheus' shortly after its release, before wiser minds pointed out to me its sometimes egregious flaws. (A friend of mine shared with me one of those 'Everything Wrong With' videos that CinemaSins produces  it's a hilarious webseries, but it sure will dull the shine of some of your favorite movies, lemme tell ya.) Your mileage may vary, especially depending on how much you enjoy horror movies, as opposed to more general science fiction.Oh! There is a mostly non-sequitur postscript that I can't help but add here  yet another one of my movie prognostications was flat out wrong. It isn't a spoiler if it's a far-out prediction that didn't happen, so I'll go ahead and share it here  during one of the ads for 'Alien: Covenant,' I could swear I heard a character call out the name 'ASH!!!!' (I've evidently started hallucinating at the start of mid-life.) I predicted that the new and robotic Walter would turn evil, and actually become the android named Ash in the 1979 original. (And why not? Androids do not age, and a web-based prologue for 'Alien Covenant' suggests their faces can be easily swapped out.) I further predicted that the more human David would be pitted against him in order to save humanity somehow from alienkind. (These things do not happen.)I still think that's a pretty clever idea, though, even if I only accidentally arrived at it. It would be great if that happened somehow in the planned 'Alien: Awakening.'",9,18,37,24 May 2017
