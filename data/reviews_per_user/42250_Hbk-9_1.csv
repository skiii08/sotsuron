Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," No matter what anybody says, this is a top movie
","After reading some of the comments posted for this movie, I felt sick to the bottom of my stomach.Here we are,saying that,yeah,its a good movie but it`s flawed.Thats nothing but B.S. This movie , along with 'lethal weapon 4',is the most awaited(prequel?) of all time and frankly,in my humble opinion, nobody wants to watch a movie to see whether its perfect or not! Sure, nobody`s perfect, but i think that George Lucas should be hailed as the god of film making for giving us a movie of the calibre of episode 1.Thumbs up George, no bull!",Null,0,0,4 August 1999
