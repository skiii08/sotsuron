Skyfall," Dreadfall !
","This must seriously be the worst Bond film ever made ! So many words that I could use to describe it, clich√©d, dull, monotonous, weak, drivel etc etc. I am only really reviewing this in light of the upcoming Bafta awards and hoping, no, praying that it doesn't win anything ! From the awful theme tune (Adele doing a very poor impression of Shirley Bassey), to the so called action scenes, dialogue, totally unbelievable baddie. Myself and my girlfriend very nearly fell asleep watching it. I can't see any merit in the film whatsoever it is just an embarrassing mess from start to (thanks God it's over) finish. If you saw the trailer with Bond fixing his cuffs in the train carriage then that is the best scene. Utter rubbish !",1,5,13,10 February 2013
The Lion King," They call me Mr Pig.....
","...... not in this sad, emotionless, oh so pretty remake.... no they don't. The characters are so devoid of heart it's such a crying shame. The original humour and love is totally wiped out. I still cry watching the original but this left me feeling cold. The songs are not a patch on the originals. Oh I could go on and on, it's not terrible and for the PC generation it's probably perfectly acceptable but it's really just not on. And what happened to 'old' Rafiki? Sad, very sad.",2,9,11,25 October 2019
1917," Absolute Bilge
","This is quite possibly, no wait, this is the worst ever depiction on film of World War 1 and thus does a great disservice to the memories of those men who lost their lives in the Great War. So totally unrealistic, terrible cringe worthy acting and desperately trying to be PC it made me sad to have wasted two hours watching it.",1,5,18,1 February 2020
Evil Dead," Rubbish
","Oh my God !!! What can I really say about this terrible film Just for the record I have seen the original many times and this remake well please read on...... This apart from the obvious Necronomicon link and the fast camera through the 'eerie woods' scenes could have actually being any low budget horror romp for a Friday night. Even the 'undead face appearing from under the basement' scene was less scary than the original. This is a total waste of time even on a weekday night with a few beers you'll find yourself ignoring the film and having a chat with your mam on the phone instead (sometimes far scarier!) There are so many remakes which do not make the grade this is one of them. Read one review said that the original was to cheesy well sorry 14 yo you should be in bed for ten at the latest anyway. Poor film, poor actors (high school jocks and nerd stoner with long hair..beards, some girls boring boring boring) Watch the original have a laugh with some beers and some girls and enjoy the scary bits. Or watch remakes of Hills have Eyes far superior. This is just my opinion...make your own minds up !",1,68,136,10 July 2013
Wonder Woman," Hmmmm...Not a masterpiece
","Firstly let me point out that I am not a hater! This film is to be quite honest dreadful, at points its like watching a charity video or a very poor government propaganda film. The acting is poor, action sequences sparse and not very exciting and oh you get it, its a bit rubbish.",1,3,12,17 September 2017
