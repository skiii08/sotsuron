Source Code," Poor imitation of Inception idea
","This movie started out with a good idea, but there were way too many holes in the plot, too many things wrong with the basic premise. The idea of going back in someone else's memory is a cool idea, but this movie did not pull it off at all.Living 8 minutes of someone else's memory is a cool concept, BUT this means that you can ONLY experience what THAT PERSON experienced. I would be okay if they expanded the scope out a bit, but that person did NOT get off the train, did NOT see a license plate, and did NOT explore the second level of the train. moronic writers didn't think that part out thoroughly enough.If the source code had included EVERYONE's memory then it would have been a bit more believable. Even if they tried to explain how the source code worked a bit more, I wouldn't be so upset, but they moved from '8 minutes of one person's memory' to 'alternate universe' concepts...what kind of jackass would write a piece of crap like that, let alone like watching it? very very very poor movie.The other thing that really irritated me was the whole happy ending, oh he gets to live in an alternate reality ending....bullshit. just let him die and rest in peace already, the whole happy ending crap just totally blew. i'd prefer to pay my money for a real 'happy ending' ;) If you've seen Inception, then you'll know that the writers are trying to pull off something similar to dream within a dream, but it just doesn't work.I'm a big fan of sci-fi, and movies that make you think, and movies that totally mess with your head, but this one is just lame. don't waste your time on this. i'd rather get a root canal than watch this piece of crap.so surprised that so many people rated this movie so high, but then again, there are a lot of dumb people out there.the bottom line - what a piece of crap. watch Inception again instead.",Null,1,3,22 August 2011
Centurion," Good fighting, sucky story
","The Good: the fighting was nice, scenes were mainly quick shots of people being skewered and sliced, blood everywhere which was cool even though it looked like it was totally added digitally. The Bad: the story completely sucked. completely. i didn't care about any the characters, the story was very predictable, and not very intriguing whatsoever. it was like watching braveheart from the other side...only i thought they deserved to get killed for slaughtering townsfolk..had to stop watching this one. and it was full of shots of the main characters running over mountains, that looked like they were lifted from lotr. This one only get 2 points for the bloody fighting, so much potential but the story completely blows.",2,7,18,21 December 2010
