Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Not my kind of movie
","We are always discovering new things about ourselves from time to time. From this movie, I find that I dislike movies that are over-flowed with insulting dirty jokes. I like slapsticks, comedy and even 'American Dreamz' does not look so bad. But this seemingly cross-cultural sting is offensive. To introduce a man who insults his wife and made him looked innocent is uncalled for. I mean, dumping on the street, naked men fighting in public, obsession with porn star, showing pictures of penis to old ladiesÂ…. If the actors were small kids, it will have been funnier!!! I have definitely taken this movie too seriously. But to me, this movie is distasteful.",2,4,8,24 April 2007
Deja Vu," Good beginning ... lousy ending
","I watched this film with great anticipation especially with actor like Denzel Washington. For most part, it was very entertaining but the ending ruined it. Although I'm a Sci-fi fan, the story line just doesn't gel. On one hand, everyone was saying that history cannot be changed and whatever that had happened, happened. For most part of the show, it seemed to follow that logic - and I liked that. But towards the end, everything starts turning the other way round. The story fell apart! I felt that the ending was done in a 'convenient' manner. I was hoping that the ending would be more thought provoking or at least with a twist.",6,0,1,23 April 2007
Kung Fu Panda," Quit, don't quit...Noodles, don't noodles
","It's a movie that my family can watch over and over again. There is just so much comedy, action and values to be taken from this show. The overall standard of this movie is comparable to that of 'The Incredibles'. The character to look out for is Oogway (a direct Chinese phonic translation of 'turtle'). He did a few meaningful quotes from the movie - 'You are too concerned with what's was and what will be. There is a saying 'Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why it's called the present.'' That's the Power of Now!Another one - '...there is just news. There is no good or bad...That is bad news if you do not believe that the Dragon Warrior can stop him.' That's the Power of Believe!",9,0,0,25 November 2008
The Bourne Ultimatum," Actions from start to finish
","Read the book decades ago. Though can't remember the details, but the film is definitely updated with new and exaggerated spy technologies. This is an action film, it is made for this entertainment purpose - so forget about the book.It is an edge-of-the-seat action-packed movie. The story keeps the movie-goers anticipating for the next scene and change of events. Every time Bourne losses a lead, you keep looking forward to what he is going to do next. His wits and resourcefulness keeps him alive. In the end, it gave me that deja vu feeling of 'Die Hard'.I would have given it a higher rating if not for the shaky camera work. It made me almost sick and could have ruined the show. The worst I had was when watching 'The Blair Witch Project'. But this is not an amateur documentary film; use the tripod!! I hope all directors would read this and stop using such camera technique.",8,3,4,30 August 2007
Ratatouille," In the league with 'The Incredibles'
","Another incredible movie from Pixar and Disney. It's a moving story and I would like to classify such movie as fairy tale. If you put in too much logic and expect something close to real life, then you'll probably not enjoy it. As a fairy tale, the story has an amusing start, an intriguing middle and an happy ending. No excessive rib-ripping laughs here. The emotions of all the characters in the movie are nevertheless very human. Perhaps too many sad moments. Never childish; so may not appeal to the very young. My kids thoroughly enjoyed it, and so did my wife.Overall, I feel that it is the powerful story that makes this movie stands out among the rest. I rated 'Ratatouille' a notch below 'The Incredibles' because if asked which would I watch again, I'll pick the latter.",9,4,6,29 October 2007
Saving Private Ryan," Best war movie I've seen
","I've watched many war movies since I was young but none have impressed me as much as Saving Private Ryan. The realism was top notch. I have served the army infantry for a number of years and I know the sound and shock of artilleries and bullets. Furthermore, the emotions of the soldiers were presented so well throughout the show.As I was watching the show, it kept prompting me to realize the hardship of war and the suffering of losing human lives. Never before has a war movie conveyed to me so deeply that we should never go to war - for whatever reason. Strange to hear myself commenting like this when I was trained so hard in the army to lead men to fight so aggressively in a possible battlefield.",10,3,6,10 September 2007
The Incredibles," The best animated movie so far
","Thoroughly enjoyable family movie. There were lots of great humor from the start to the end. Coupled with lots of actions and a variety of super heroes. The characters were depicted as if they were 'real' because they suffered from real world problems. My kids watched the DVD over and over again. The funny thing is that the adults don't seems to mind. Even the shorts, like Jack-Jack Attack and Bounchin' were great. I just hope that the sequel (if there is going to be one) will be done delicately. Don't want to see just another 'follow-up' to a successful film. Ingredients for success - a totally different story line and lots of creative and original humor.",10,1,1,23 April 2007
Shrek the Third," Many small laughs does not a make good movie
","That's what the whole movie is made of - many disjointed small jokes and humor to string together to storyline that is too one dimensional. The main story is so typical - it's for kids. But yet, small kids may not understand many of the humor. There are so many characters taking turn to show off but none that is deep enough to captivate the audience. You might hear the whole theater roaring with laughter at some times, but in the end, it was just not as entertaining as the previous two Shrek movies.Nevertheless, the graphic details is amazing. Thanks to the graphics designers and computer technology, the animation is delightful to watch.",6,0,0,2 June 2007
The Matrix," I can still watch it over again
","Must have watched it 3 or 4 times over the years and the story telling did not disappoint me every time. I must confess that I'm a sci-fi fan. Those computers, machines and AI are futuristic things that never fails to widen the imagination. But the part that captures me most is the 'regilious' part of the story telling.<ul><li>'Everything is not real' in the Matrix world and so is our world according to some religious teachings.</li></ul><ul><li>'Cause-and-effect' as described by the Frenchmen.</li></ul><ul><li>'Re-birth' of the several 'version' of the computer program is synonymous to man's re-incarnation.</li></ul><ul><li>'Transient of animals/men to higher being' as told by Oracle.</li></ul><ul><li>'Messiah' - that's Neo of course.</li></ul><ul><li>'Believe' that fate and faith will save man-kind.</li></ul>There are lots of Kung Fu and special effects but they're just garnishes. I'm impressed by the way the story is told.",10,0,1,23 April 2007
The Pursuit of Happyness," You are what you think about
","I'm a salesman myself and I can almost empathize with Gardner's struggle to achieve his dreams. Having a very strong desire to attain our goals and believing that we can do anything is so key to being successful. That's the inspirational message I drew from this movie.I read several comments from others that criticize the film in its strong association of happiness to getting a job in a stock broking firm. Taken literally, I would have agreed. However, I like to believe that Gardner's happiness is not so much as to getting a job in the stock broking firm but in achieving a step in his goal. His goal was to be with his son and to provide for him. He could have gotten a job as a dishwasher and still make-do. But if man do not have big dreams, we might still be living in caves.The Pursuit of Happiness is about the realization of a man's goal. He does that by simply programming in his mind that he can and must achieve it. When that's done, nothing can stop him - be it discouraging words from his wife, the financial difficulty he was in and the disadvantaged position compared to his peers. The mind will find the way.I would have given it a 9 or a 10 but in many parts, I felt it was too dramatized and far-fetched.",8,0,1,23 April 2007
