Alien 3," This gets too much hate
","Look this movie gets way too much hate because they killed off Ripley and Newt But it was a good movie; the cast was memorable, the xenomorph was legitimately scary, they subvert a lot of expectations, Sigourney Weaver delivered an incredible performance as Ripley; like always, the effects were great, and the suspense is well done. Granted there are a TON of plot holes in this movie but it's still enjoyable",7,4,4,6 August 2018
It," Scariest movie since the original
","So this is a brutal, suspense filled horror movie that Steven King himself probably loved and much like Tim Curry, Bill Skarsgì±…rd stays in character in character throughout the entirety of the movie. Although I feel that they went a little too far out of their way to make Pennywise scarier in this than the original. Also Georgie's death was incredible and horrifically gruesome, the way Pennywise bites off Georgie's arm and when Georgie struggles to crawl away was great",10,0,1,27 August 2018
Predator," Timelessly amazing
","There are plenty of things that work with this movie like in the first major action scene Dutch and his team dispatch the guerillas with ease so you get a sense that this is just gonna be another runofthemill action movie but after the guerillas are killed the movie shifts to a slowly paced movie. Another thing that works is the look and abilities of the Predator itself, and how all of the characters are different kinds of badass and resourceful",10,0,0,18 July 2018
Alien vs. Predator," Good idea, bad execution
","They really should've paid more attention to the previously established media involving the Predators and Aliens and the comics because this movie ignores everything that all of the original comics and movies established except for the Predator's Sense of honor in the hunt. In the first two Predator movies it's established that the Predators are attracted to high levels of heat and conflict but this movie takes place in Antarctica for some reason; also in this movie it's stated that the fight between Aliens and Predators has been going on since Egyptian times which contradicts the other movies' timelines, the aliens mature into full grown Xenomorphs in a matter of seconds instead of a matter of hours like in all of the other movies prior to this one, continuity pretty much doesn't exist in this movie, the dialog was horrendous; without all of the humans freaking out this movie could've been like 30 minutes Long, two of the three Predators were incabable of killing their prey, it's painfully obvious when they switch between CGI and animatronics for the AliensIf you're a fan of cool alien fight scenes this movie has a few which are cool but that's about the only good thing this movie has to offer. So bottom line if you've never seen this movie and you're a fan of the Alien and Predator franchises keep it that way, stay as far away from this movie as possible",1,0,1,27 August 2018
Get Out," Amazing
","This movie is amazing; it is obviously a commentary on racism, the acting is phenomenal; did you know that Daniel Kaluuya (the actor who plays Chris) is actually British but he managed to hide his accent seamlessly through out the movie I actually didn't know that until someone told me, they introduce hypnosis which is really cool, the characters make smart decisions like when Chris picks cotton from a chair he was tied to and uses said cotton to plug his ears to keep himself from being hypnotized, It gives you plenty of time to get to know the characters, and the kills are unique but it's not a slasher with kills every five minutes all of the kills actually happen in the last act of the movie",10,0,2,21 August 2018
Deadpool," Funny and brutal
","Now this movie may have had what some would call ' a paper thin plot' and 'A cookie cutter villain' those were actually deliberate choices by the studio. Ryan Reynolds was beyond the perfect choice to play Wade Wilson. Personally my favorite part of the movie was when Deadpool had Francis (Ajax) pinned to the ground and was about to shoot him in the face Colossus starts giving a speech about how it only takes about 4 or 5 moments to be a hero but you can tell Deadpool doesn't care so he shoots and kills Francis anywaybut they did make some changes to Deadpool's backstory but that doesn't detract from the movie one bit; like in Deadpool's original backstory Ajax didn't manage the workshop that gave Deadpool his powers he was the assistant to Doctor Killbrew, in the original backstory Deadpool was handed over to the weapon X program, or how in the original backstory the 'deadpool' was a gambling ring that Dr. Killbrew's other prisoners formed where they would place bets on each other's survival under the knife but again none of these changes detract from the movie in the slightest.",10,0,1,10 August 2018
Alien: Covenant," Ridley Scott at his finest
","So I actually loved this movie especially how it gave more backstory to the xenomorphs, like how they came into existence; because nothing could evolve into becoming a 'perfect organism' like they describe in the movies though it was pretty obvious that David killed Walter or maybe he took over his body or something off Camera if you pay attention. The Neomorphs and Protomorphs are badass despite the fact that they are clearly less intelligent than the xenomorph species we all know and love. And like all of the movies it frequently builds a lot of suspense to an epic pay off",10,4,6,24 July 2018
