",This movie is just so bad. awful cinematography and pitiful story and acting. u can literally fall asleep as the movie is so long and boring with NOTHING AT ALL happening in it. easily the worst horror movie of all time,1,0,6,16 November 2019
Joker," Overrated, slow, nothing intriguing
","Don't really get the hype and all the 10 star reviews. Joaquin's performance was good for the role he had, but the story itself was quite dumb, boring and predictable. Certainly didn't enjoy it in the cinema. Don't think I'd enjoy it at home either.
If you get your head out of the hype and praise for Phoenix's performance, I'm pretty sure everyone would give it a 4-6/10",4,3,11,6 February 2020
