The Devil's Advocate," Pure Greatness!
","I guess I am one of the very few people who find the movie much superior than most thrillers considered as cinematic masterpieces. Yes, I find The Devil's Advocate better than let's say LA Confidential.As a court room thrillers fan, I cannot hate or not like that movie. The story follows a young lawyer Kevin Lomax played by Keanu Reeves who turns out to be a great lawyer and gets sent to New York for his first real big case. He is about to get married and so Kevin could be the happiest man on earth. The man he gets sent to is John Milton played by Al Pacino. A man with style who appreciates Kevin's achievements by far and he admire his enthusiasm and of course, he sees a lighter future in Kevin. After all, a great lawyer could put anyone out of great situation. Milton is in fact his new boss. New Yor, beautiful wife, fame, prestige, success. Of course nothing could be perfect for one human being. Not in life, nor in movies. Strange things starts to happen with our main character, the people he knows become different. His life is about to become a nightmare and it turns out that Milton is some kind of a living on earth Lucifer.One of the greatest 'lawyer' kind of movies, plots ever. The movie is much more of a deep drama with dark and unexpected moments, then a thriller with an optimistic, smiling and happy lawyer who saves the day for wrongfully accused innocent looking guy. The movie hides a great cliché among its deeper meanings. Fame's fatality. Kevin's character is a provincial guy with innocent understanding for his life, with no imagination or great brain. In fact, he is nothing special, but he is a lawyer who wins cases and people love him. He is lucky, God has 'touched' him and everything works fine until he commits a sin by celebrating his fame, becoming a new person with higher standards, different attitude to his friends and wife. He becomes a whole new person that God does not love anymore. Well, I think it might be kind of a metaphor. He has been in heave all his life, you know what I mean and when he commits the sin, he fells in hell without realizing it and John Milton is the devil. And because the most part of the movie takes place after he becomes the new person, that kinda symbolizes who the devil is playing with him and how he turns his life into a nightmare. That's the devil's job after all. For example the scene with the baby playing with insides. These are basically the things you realize if you look into the movie deeper. It's great, cause it's full of clichés about degradation and wrong life if I could put it in that way, covered with metaphors and symbolisms and the movie is fresh and original as a final result and in my case, I loved it.As for the acting. Bad actor and one of the greatest actors alive. Eccentric and fun combination that could challenge people watch the movie only for that particular reason. Well, Reeves gives all he got and I could easily say it's his best performance by far. He plays the same characters, but this time, his character is given life, his character is a normal human, his character is based on a book character. I could list many reasons why an actor I hate, a bad actor gives a good performance in a great movie. And as for Pacino - I was surprised he had taken the role so seriously. The final duologue scene is probably the best in the movie, mostly cause of his acting, his ability to keep the balance between overacting where he has to and be himself where he wants to, improvising. Exactly what a devil in human form, would be.10 out of 10 - almost no flaws.",10,1,1,19 March 2006
The Blair Witch Project," Worst serious horror movie of the 90s
","I'll start with saying that I am really big horror fan with capital B and as I have heard Blair Witch Project is one of the scariest horror movies ever. This is hilarious. I can't believe somebody really get scared by such a crappy movie. The movie of course has the usual 'true story' sign, but this time we are brought the story itself as a footage. Yeah, what we see had really happened from what I understood. And the worst thing is that people had believe it 7 years ago and I still read posts about Blair Witch Project being an example of a really scary movie. There are even people who don't find it scary, but they like it. Otherwise, I can't explain that ending, this popularity and its sequel which I haven't seen and I don't intend to do it in this life. And the really really worst of all, is that people had believed it as I said. I guess that if I believed in this, I would have liked it. It is similar to My Little Eye which is a really good horror movie that made me look behind my back. We have stupid teens overacting, camera looking like a home video and some interviews with people convincing the audience and the teens themselves that this curse or whatever it is, really exist. Oh, and we have no themes and songs, cause it is supposed to be happening for real and 5 years later this tape is a movie that is supposed to scare us.This is basically The Blair Witch Project. I don't like the story, but I would have appreciated the try to be recreated with actors and normal camera with themes. It would have been stupid, but nothing stupid that tries to conquer the genre with its reality. This sucks. I got bored, I nearly fell asleep after 40 boring minutes and then I realized that whatever happens till the end of the movie, I would hate it and the movie I hate could be counted on the fingers of the persons involved with this story. And I can't give 1 to a movie, but The Blair Witch Projects is bad in any single aspect and believe me, I wanted to give it a try after thinking of worse horror movies. It didn't work.",6,1,2,14 February 2006
Scarface," Classic!
","Scarface is definitely in the top 100 movies ever made. Not my top 100, but overall and I don't agree with its place at the Top 250. It's a movie about almost anything. There are quite a few movies like it, but Scarface is something special. If it didn't come out between movies like The Godfather and Goodfellas, I am sure it would have been even a more special movie. We have a really interesting character. Tony Montana who is involved with the drugs business. Nervous, eccentric, strange, funny. Something from everything. I assume that Al Pacino is the only actor that could play such a person. He was chosen for best actor of all time and this movie made his name gold since it was silver after The Godfather. At least this is my opinion on Pacino's career. Stunning performance. Of course the movie is much more than 'Woah, Pacino rules', but he is the highlight like Hanks in Forrest Gump, Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs, Depp in Ed Wood. You know what I mean.So the movie has other colorful and interesting characters which brought a great atmosphere to the movie. Such as Michelle Pfeiffer's heroine who is Montana's wife in the later period of the movie, some infamous for me names did a great performance, such as Tony's friends and his sister.Brian De Palma's best movie and Stone's script are NO 2 most important thing. Really tremendous writing by Stone who has had drug problems at that time. Really interesting story around him and Scarface. After Scarface, he has written many scripts of some classic movies such as Platoon. The relation between Montana and his sister is very well made and most of all realistic. Other screenwriter wouldn't have paid any attention on such thing when he has Pacino, great drug story, action and great lines. De Palma's direction is remarkable. The chainsaw scene was nicely directed. The very last scene - classic. The movie stresses on many human nature issues. Such as Montana's self confidence, prejudices, trust, friends. Many scenes show what is trust between Tony and his friends. The cliché about when a man becomes rich, he becomes a bad person is created delightful. Tony's power over other people make him degrade and that is where the movie becomes much more than a typical mob drama/crime. The action scenes are great addition to the great story, but I find them rather being a great bonus then something the movie wouldn't have managed without.The score -perfect. Without stoppage, I say the score is something special. It fits in the movie in a unique way. I don't know how many times I have used a positive word in this review, but the movie deserves it. I really loved it and respected it.There will never be another movie like Scarface although this comes from the mouth of a person who prefers prefers Goodfellas to Scarface. Great director, one of the greatest actor of all time although far from my personal favorite and remarkable writer who is one big, big man and by big I don't mean size. Respect for Oliver Stone. If I had to describe the movie with one word, it would have been classic without any doubt. Scarface:10/10",10,1,3,13 February 2006
Meet the Parents," Funny Movie by funny actors
","Meet the Parents is a good movie.Directed by Jay Roach.And the actors for the movie are perfectly picked.Everybody fits in his own character.It is a story about the love but this love is a tough job.The main character is Greg Focker.He is a nurse in the literally meaning of the word.His girlfriend is Pam who is a teacher of little children.They are both in love.The problem is that Greg has to live in Pam's family's house.And her family is not that good.Actually her mother is very nice woman who just want to help for the happiness of her daughter.The problem is Jack.Her father.He is a man of his word.He loves his daughter and he can kill if somebody hurt her.The meeting begins good but the first mistake that Greg makes is that he says,he doesn't like cats and then a fluffy little cat goes in the hands of Jack.There are many jokes and fun.Even some intensive moments.The movie is one great big fun.Robert De Niro himself is the strict father and Ben Stiller is Greg.I give this movie 8 cause it is really a classic in the comedy genre.Enjoy.",7,1,2,20 September 2005
Rocky V," The worst in the series, but still good
","I have said many times that I am probably one of the very few movie fans that love all Rocky sequels. Don't really know why. Love the 80s decade and I regret I am born in 1990 and I have missed these great years for movies. The original is classic and all the sequels are some of the most entertaining sequels to a movie ever made. Kinda underrated maybe. Now back to the 5th which we thought is the last. Here we have an older Rocky with a son. A talented guy wants Rocky to coach him in boxing and he agrees, cause he thinks the boy may become like him and as a matter of fact, he sees himself in this boy while the truth is far from Rocky's understandings. He becomes obsessed by this guy and he coaches him every day all day long and the boy becomes a real boxer that cannot be beaten. Rocky forgets his family, doesn't have time for his son's problems and basically this is the new stuff here.Well, not bad. Don't like a son introduction, don't like the different Rocky which is kinda stupid, cause Rocky has never been so smart to realize that he is split between coach and a father. He listens to everyone and agrees. At least this is what I have noticed in most everyday life scenes from the previous movies.Why it is the worst? Well, it is needless in my opinion. It's not Rocky who fights. In fact I thought that the whole 5th movie could have been made into 2 or 3 scenes and put in the previous movies. It has nothing to do with a progress in the plot except for the son. Anyway, I respect it a lot, cause it is simply Rocky.6 out of 10.",6,6,8,26 February 2006
Spider-Man 2," The Best Comic Book Adaptation Ever
","Spiderman 2 is one of the greatest movie ever.Comic book movies aren't so good.Well not all but some of them wasn't really that good.Just effects.Nobody tries to do something more that an immortal character who has very strange abilities and effects.Spiderman was the first one that did this.It showed Peter Parker as a person.We don't imagine Spiderman like a character who can't be killed anymore.And now the sequel surprised me in positive way.A wonderful movie.Just great.It even entered my all time Top 20.Now Peter works as a pizza deliver for the first 10 minutes of the movie.He had to be Spiderman till delivering a pizza in the other part of the town.He saved a lot of people but of course he didn't deliver the pizza in time and he was fired.It was sad when we understood that he had a birthday.Now he live with his aunt and they have a financial problems.His problems continues.Marry Jane marries other guy.Reason is that Peter was wait for her theater show.He had to save people again and when he arrived they didn't let him.The villain is Doc.OK.My all time favorite Spiederman bad guy.He is played by Alfred Molina.This is the plot and the movie is more than great.It is a drama and action together.Spiderman 2-Toby MacGuire,Kirsten Dunst,Alfred Molina,James Franco.I gave it 9.",9,1,2,20 September 2005
Insomnia," Really great thriller with unforgettable acting
","Insomnia might be considered as one of the few commercial thrillers from the past 10 years, but of course that doesn't necessary mean it's not good. In fact, it's really great. I don't quite know what I liked so much, but when I think about it, I really loved it. After the movie ended, I thought it's nothing special, but it's something I would recommend. Well, I guess I have seen some bad thrillers lately and I appreciate what Insomnia showed me.We have a story about a detective investigating a murder among the woods of a small city. Very few citizens and nobody could suspect anything bad could happen. One day, Will Dormer played by Al Pacino, along with his colleagues are in action, trying to catch the killer. The is a fog and Will is completely alone when he sees a man with a gun pointed at him. He shoots him, thinking it's the suspect, but it turns out that it's another one of his colleagues. Nobody finds out about this and Will starts living in fear, keeping that secret. And the most important is that the real killer saw Will killing his friend and now Will could do nothing except waiting, helping the killer in what he needs. His life becomes a nightmare.Well, it's a nice plot. There is a drama element in the movie that you would probably like. It kinda fits with the story, the atmosphere and the location where the movie takes place. Dark, lonely place with a bad mood atmosphere surrounding it. Somehow you could not have a straight thriller or a satire. It just cries for drama. And if we add that Pacino's character has had bad life and he lives in a nightmare, the pessimism takes place and you understand the movie is not what you thought it would be. After the first half an hour, the movie becomes more of a character study then a crime - thriller with great twists and tension. And since I put SPOILERS, I would allow myself to tell you that the killer in fact appears on screen 40-50 minutes before the end. It's kinda Se7en style, but with different plot purposes. This time Walter Finch played by Robbin Williams, is a cheater, a cold blood murderer and kinda eccentric and sly person. At least enough sly and clever to rule Pacino's character. At least I did have expectation for a tensed thriller with a twist, but as I said it became a character study which is kinda provocative and it explains why Insomnia has some haters. I personally liked it. I guess Pacino played his role in a great way, so there was no way I could have been disappointed. And the bottom line is that it actually turns out that I loved the character study factor, cause of Pacino's great performance. I don't see anything wrong with it, but some people do. In this particular case, it depends on what are your expectation before viewing Insomnia.I want to point out that Williams as the killer, was ridiculous. This is a thing I hated. He is not believable at all. His facial is funny even when he tries to be deranged psychopath. Acting is indeed great as I said many times already, but that was one of the worst cast choices ever. Of course we have great Swank performance which for me is the best actress alive these days, we have Pacino with a great performance as the unhappy, pessimistic looking detective and some nice performances by not that know performers. The director Christopher Nolan, perfectly know with Memento, does his job. I just thought that there might be people who are ready to view Insomnia, immediately after they are told it's from Memento's director. Final words - highly recommended fresh and original drama - thriller with different and casual plot moments and superb acting.",6,0,1,21 March 2006
The Day After Tomorrow," Great, realistic and one of the best movies of 2004
","I had high expectations 2 years ago when the trailers of the movies which were a lot and looked really promising and scary. I have always considered Emmerich as an average director who is given high budget projects and he directs them in not a bad way, but people can't see what he is good at and that's why he remains an average director. Kinda Michael Bay probably. High budget, amazing special effects, entertaining, kinda optimistic and so on. This is the reason movies like Independence Day and Godzilla are rated low and are examples of bad movies although I like both of them a lot.Now about The Day After Tomorrow - I consider it as Emmerich's best movie. It's nicely directed, it's realistic and authentic which makes it scary it some ways and a little distant from the other light summer blockbusters and 2004 had many, many summer blockbusters.The special effects were incredible which is not that much of a surprise since many people talk about how The Day After Tomorrow depends on these action/destruction special effects scene. Nah, I don't think so, but I love special effects and this time they are special and make the movie realistic. I don't remember which guy from the crew said that, but it sounded very true:'If we hadn't hurry finish the movie, we would have been making a documentary'. The end of the world topic is nicely stressed although we finally have some personal views for the nightmare.The soundtrack is great and I loved some themes, especially the one from the documentary of the movie. It's a sad theme about how many people die due to the the beginning of another glacial age.The acting is OK for such a movie. The story is not that personal, but considering that in Independence Day, the president was one of the characters, it is personal indeed. A father and son drama and characters not related with our main characters who personally I cared for, like the sick kid and the female doctor.Overall The Day After Tomorrow is a great movie and although 2004 wasn't that much of a great movie year, it was something I would watch again, something that entertained me, something that amazed me at that period and it used to be a very favorite movie of mine 20 months ago, but I watched many, many classics since then and I changed my opinion. It was a good period and I will always remember some of my very first favorite movies even if they are not included in my top 10 of all time anymore. Just a good memory. And I wish Emmerich luck with his new project which promises to be something the fans would like to see and if they like it, they will start having respect for Emmerich which is going to be a progress in his career although his career has never been and it will never be something special.",7,1,2,18 February 2006
Armageddon," One of Bay's worst which is equal to BAD!
","I have to say that I had low expectations for the movie before viewing it. All the people around said it was great, but I perfectly knew what they like. They like Aerosmith's song which is indeed great, they like the amazing special effects which had coasted a lot, they like the comedy side of the movie and of course many girls who love Affleck who according to my opinion is a really bad actor who tried not to be one, failed and now he is nothing. And all these things plus the reviews and the ratings I read in internet, gave me a clue the movie would be a huge disappointment since I am a big disaster kind of movies fan. Well, I've been right, but at least I was prepared.The movie is really commercial. It's been said, but I will say it as again. We have over #100 million budget, we have a romance between Hollywood stars Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler and many other famous actors, who are popular with the fact that they rarely agree on becoming a part of the cast of a commercial movie if their names aren't written with big letters on the screen. Such as Billy Bob Thornton and Steve Buscemi which are highly respected actors that I also like a lot. They could play many characters in many different kind of movies. They could improvise, they could turn tasteless lines into hilarious jokes. On the whole, they could turn small movies into really interesting, funny or dramatic motion pictures, people love and will always love. Such as Fargo in Buscemi's case or A Simple Plan - Thornton. And to be honest, I am really disappointed they took part of Armageddon. Thornton plays a smart and refined man involved in politics if I remember correctly. Buscemi is one of the members of the deep core drilling team which is sent to save the world by destroying the asteroid which is about to vanish the world.What I didn't like - well, I guess I've been already understood. I pointed out bad factors. The story is dull, artless and silly. It is so obvious that the movie depends on the effects and the dramatic ending that it's ridiculous. At least movies like Deep Impact and Godzilla have something special that might be considered as art. At least it ain't that obvious that the movie is made of financial purposes. Other than that, bad performances from all the huge stars. The jokes ain't funny, the lines are absurd and sometimes, they doesn't make sense at all. In fact, I recently read that on the stage, Ben Affleck has asked Bay whether it would be easier if they teach astronauts to drill, than drillers to becomes astronauts and Bay's reply has been simply 'Shut up!' which is a really funny story which perfectly shows the creators's desperation.And enclosing, I'll give an explanation why I give 4 to the movie. Well, I like 'Don't Want to Miss a thing' and I was impressed by the special effects which are obviously the only good thing in the movie. The first scene is memorable. These are the the only 2 good things I liked about the movie. Michael Bay is an average director, but The Rock and both Bad Boys were hundreds of times better than Armageddon which was, is and will always be one big bad movie.",4,0,2,21 March 2006
The Usual Suspects," Best Thriller of the 90s
","This movie is simply a classic. I don't know what words to use to describe this movie. They have been already used million times. It's one of those movie you should watch 3 times to understand everything and 5 more times, simply cause you've loved them. Of course The Usual Suspects is not the first and it's not the only unforgettable thriller, but is without a doubt my personal favorite from what I have seen by far. Of course Scream is my all time favorite movie, but I have seen it 50 times and I realized that the movie is more of a horror, but I'll discuss this another time. A movie one of a kind. Some of the best actors star in The Usual Suspects. Kevin Spacey is the main character and he delivers probably the best performance, but Pollack, Baldwin and Del Toro's performances are unforgettable.The direction is flawless and creative, the writing is one of the best ever. The story is one of the best ever. I am really surprised it is not based on the book, cause it is a really incredible story direct for the screen. Great music as well. One of the best movies ever, probably one of the best thrillers ever, some of the greatest acting ever. As I said everything I say about this movie, have bee said before and it is a cliché. It's just a movie that makes you love cinema more and more. Piece of art.10/10 of course.",10,0,1,26 February 2006
Rocky," Stallone's best performance
","This is no doubt one of the best movies ever made and I am really mad, cause many people think it's overrated and that Scorsese's Taxi Driver was better. The movie's purpose is not showing a boxer's life in details. It's a sad and realistic movie. I don't know how many of you realized that many parts of the movie were like a documentary of the life of an average American and if we cut the whole sport thing, the movie would have been a documentary that make us think and realize how lucky we are. Rocky's life sucked and boxing for him was something more than just hobby or something he likes to do. It's the thing that destroyed the bad thoughts in his mind. He might have seemed stupid and careless about what is going to happen to him, but I don't think so. Haven't you ever met a person who doesn't show he cares about something with facials, actions or words, but he just feels it inside him and he doesn't feel the need to release it. That was Rocky's character and that is why I love that movie. Well one of the many reasons. The supporting characters are wonderful as well and the original Rocky is something not to be forgotten ever while the sequels are just entertaining. Once again - a wonderful motion picture I will always love, with great atmosphere, score. Well some bad editing and direction, but who cares. A movie with no flaws wouldn't be a movie.",10,1,2,21 September 2005
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Average action flick with high budget
","Yes, that is exactly what Mr. and Mrs. Smith is. I recently understood that this movie supposed to be one of the highest grossing summer movies. I almost fell down. I thought it's just one of those movies that are mostly comedies that bring many people in the theaters for 2 or 3 weeks maximum and the movie gets completely forgotten, but it turned out that it is a box office disaster among with Bewitched. Give me a break. So what do we have here. Brad pit who is a great actor, but he not here. The spotlight is his and nothing could stop his overacting. The same could be said about Jolie, but I am a male and I didn't care she couldn't act that good, you know. So they play a separated couple who by accident get mission to kill themselves in different circumstances. OK, I guess that even the director and the screenwriter realize that the story won't make people watch the movie over and over again in the theaters. So we have action. Lots of action and lots of special effects. And still nothing. All the action scenes are ridiculous. Pit and Jolie shoot at each other with guns in a kitchen and they weren't even damaged and at the same time they are being sarcastic. OK again, I know the movie is not supposed to be serious even in the action moments, but what the hell was funny about these 4-5 action/comedy moments?! I think nothing. And there is nothing more that could make the movie special. Overally, it wasn't the worst movie of the year for sure, but it was from the high disappointments among with Episode 3 for example. I respect action movies and I think Jolie is hot and I also think it's a good way of killing time so it deserves a 6 for sure.",5,1,5,21 January 2006
The Silence of the Lambs," Another proof that Anthony Hopkins is the best British actor of all time
","Silence of the Lambs is a movie about the madness and the psychic.This is its greatness.I have watched Red Dragon and Hanibal before Silence of the Lambs and i knew that it won't be better than Red Dragon but it will be much better than Hanibal and i was right.This is the oldest movie of the trilogy but it is a sequel of Red Dragon which was released in 2002.Now about Silence of the Lambs.The plot is about an FBI agent who must reveal the secret of Buffalo Bill-crazy psychopath who is doing weird things with his victims.Her name is Clarice Starling.She finds that Dr.Hanibal Lecter can help her with this case.Hanibal is played by Anthony Hopkins and he is the best thing in this movie.Really his greatest performance.The proviso is that he will tell Clarice about Bufallo Bill and his secrets,only if she tells him about her personal live.Her tragedy is that her father has died when she was young.This is about the plot.Very original idea for recreation of the life of an FBI agent fighting against pure and simple Madness.",7,2,5,20 September 2005
