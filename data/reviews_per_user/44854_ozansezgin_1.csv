Requiem for a Dream," A movie like Poe's Raven
","First, I have to say that I never felt a movie hurt me before. It slapped me in the face, punched me on the kidneys, kicked me in the bowels. But I think it's the director's systematical work for the movie made me the way I felt.No sense in explaining or summarizing the film. I want to write about the system. Aronofsky has instituted a rare system for his movie that makes it run on itself. The sequences for certain drugs, the sequences for drinking coffee, turning on the TV, split screens and all details build up a skeleton for the film. The story then finds its space to fit in. It's excellent work. It's like Edgar Allan Poe's masterpiece, Raven... Mathematically perfect, calculated with absolute attention, Darren Aronofsky's film is like a poem you can write in two years. The perfectness of the piece squeezes your heart and mind bit by bit until the end of the movie.Will I watch it again? I'll say, of course. Don't you listen to a song you like a million times even it's depressing or whatever?..",8,0,1,15 August 2005
