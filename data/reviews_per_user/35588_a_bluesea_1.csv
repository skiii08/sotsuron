The Ring," Leaves you thinking...
","This movie leaves you with a saturated feeling of evil.  It scares you at a base level (the feeling you get when your startled, uneasy, or frightened). Over the past week I have thought about this movie numerous times, and can't wait to see it again..  I wish they made more movies like this again.. The story develops beautifully, and the ending makes the film.  I can't wait to buy the DVD when it comes out, but I'm afraid that after watching it, someone might call my house and mutter 'seven days'...9 out of 10 stars....",10,0,0,16 November 2002
