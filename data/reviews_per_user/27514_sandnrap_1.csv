The Ring," Suspense thriller with top-notch acting
","Actually ended up seeing 'The Ring' when the movie we originally went to see, '8 Crazy Nights', wasn't what we expected.  The 'we' included myself and my two oldest children, ages 13 and 11.  I figured it was a PG-13 flick so what the heck.  Not long into this thriller, I realized it may not be appropriate for them (or me, I scare easily).  But the kids were entranced and it was an early show on New Year's Eve so we stuck it out.  With the subplots and the all-around fantastic acting, I would give this movie a very high rating.  The ending left you hanging, as do most movies in this category.  And parents, be warned ... scenes from this movie (like the mother's memory of the daughter in the closet and the here she comes out of the TV scene) rival that of Linda Blair's spinaroo in 'The Exorcist'.",Null,0,0,2 January 2003
