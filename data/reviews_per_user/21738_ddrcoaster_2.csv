Angels & Demons," Why are People Bashing this Movie?
","I go to the movies to be entertained. I was very entertained by the first film in this series: The DaVinci Code. It had plenty of twists and turns throughout to keep me very interested. Angels and Demons is no different. If you enjoyed the DaVinci Code, then you will undoubtedly enjoy this movie as well. Angels and Demons is made pretty much with the exact same style as the previous film, but faster paced, which I liked. Ron Howard kept me glued to my seat for the full two hours without boring me one bit.What I really liked about this movie was that even though it is obviously fictitious, they leave enough real history to make it seem very believable. If there is one thing that I didn't like about this movie, it is that the plot itself is very unbelievable (don't want to give any spoilers). But hey, it's a movie. I was entertained throughout the whole thing and was very satisfied with what I saw.",7,105,159,15 May 2009
Star Trek," Wow, Great Movie!
","I have never seen a full episode of Star Trek in my life, but when I saw the previews for this movie, I knew I had to go see it. It didn't disappoint one bit. The movie was filled with great storytelling, great action sequences, and the CGI was possibly the best I have ever seen on any film. I liked pretty much everything about this movie, from the gorgeous visuals to the surprisingly good storyline that was quite clever. If there was one thing I could change about this movie though, I would make it longer! When I sat down in the theater, I was expecting to be there for a good 3 and a half to 4 hours. It turns out the movie was only 2! It is still an amazing two hours though, I highly recommend going to see this one.",9,3,8,15 May 2009
