Vertigo," Wild and frantic
","This thriller about a detective who's drawn into a complex plot, which is indirectly involved with his fear of heights, is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most discussed films. James Stewart plays the acrophobic detective hired by an old friend to watch his wife, played by Kim Novak. Stewart falls in love with the mysterious woman, who is preoccupied with the life of a 19th century beauty. An unusual role for Stewart, whose humble, good-guy image is at odds with his character here - an obsessed, guilt-ridden man driven to extreme actions. Enhanced by Bernard Herrmann's haunting score.",Null,1,2,24 February 2000
10 Things I Hate About You," Despise the limit
","Kat, the furiously flip take no prisoners heroine of '10 things I hate about you' might be described as a ball buster, although that would hardly do her justice. Brainy, beautiful and haughty as hell, with dancing feline eyes she narrows in contempt at any guy unlucky enough to make a play for her, Kat has a lot in common with the babelicious teases who saunter through high school movies, like leonine queens of the adolescent jungle. The difference is that Kat isn't going to win any popularity contests. She's a willowy high strung misfit who armors herself with gender war rhetoric, pretending she's better than everyone around her. She uses her bitchery and wit to put down guys for the unforgivable crime of being guys. This may be the cheekiest 'literary' update yet - a post riot grrrl gloss on 'The taming of the shrew' with Shakespeare's plot twirled around devices that have become cliches, virtually overnight in the new teen comedies - the guy who struggles to land a girl in order to win a bet - the ingenue - in this case Kat's younger sister - the button nosed Bianca - who's a virgin to everything but consumerism. The film casts an amusingly jaundiced eye on the unholy status games of contemporary teen culture. When the big keg blowout arrives, it's a quesy tequila soaked suburban sprawl, with make out session glimpses in all their squirmy desperation and a nerd bragging to two girls about his play to buy... a Toyota Tercel. At the center of this nasty spitfire is, Kat. The young actress Julia Stiles in her first major roles, casually plays against her luminescent Pre-Raphaelite glow. At times her hot blooded earthiness recalls Cate Blanchett in 'Elizabeth' and she makes Kat cruelly ambivalent about the effect of her sexuality on others. Along the way Kat is wooed and then 'tamed' by a suitor of surprising Charm - Patrick a gentle Aussie heart-throb who's like Val Kilmer before he went falky - he knows just how to kill Kat with kindess. The film's snappish crank case doesn't break any molds, but it certainly gives you a lift.",Null,0,0,17 April 2000
American Psycho," Chopping Spree
","Mary Harron's 'American Psycho' is a merry prankster nightmare. A cheerfully irreverent drawing room slasher movie about a natty young Wall Street serial killer, who for all his smug ruthlessness is also the film's anxious, cringing conscience. He's a macho monster who's all aquiever on the inside. Harron, has worked a kind of alchemy on Bret Easton Ellis' infamous 1991 novel, which turned homicide into the ultimate blatant metaphor for yuppie heartlessness. The book was a manufactured scandal - a show boat catalog of brand names and body parts, all engineered to call attention to Ellis' hate-chic 'audacity.' Harron eliminates most of the author's graphic, nearly surgical grisliness and the ugly currents of misogyny as well (the killer's delight in hacking up woman may have been the book's single deepest emotion.) She stages the blood splattered violence as stylized tongue in cheek spectacle, complete with chain saws and gleaming axes, that's as kicky and easy to watch as say the murders in the 'Scream' films. Funny, pungent and weirdly gripping, 'American Psycho' is a satire that feels like a hallucination. The film doesn't entirely work; it's confounding when it should be haunting. Yet Christian Bale as the psychotic keeps Patrick lurching blindly toward humanity, until we see a self being born in a man who, paradoxically was too selfish to have one.",Null,1,2,9 April 2000
Dark City," Wait until dark
","If nothing else, 'Dark City' is proof of what an eye popping cornucopia of druggy science fiction imagery can now be jammed into a single fantasy film. It's also proof of what little impact such imagery will make if we have no investment in the story it's decorating. In a spectacularly sunless, floating urban doomscape, the humans have become guinea pigs for a tribe of ghostly aliens - bald, white faced phantoms who wear black overcoats and speak in doleful british accents. (They're like a race of Nosferatus all yearning to play Hamlet.) The aliens are obsessed with that musty Spockian query, What is it that makes humans... human? To find the answer, they extract memories of their subjects and inject them into other bodies. The hero wakes up in a bathtub only to discover that he has been given the mind of a serial killer. Directed by Australia's Alex Proyas, who debuted with 'The crow', 'Dark City' might be described as techno-Goth music video noir. A tin-pot amalgam of 'Blade runner' and 'Strange days' with an attention deficit style of editing (these aren't jump cuts, they're jitter cuts) and sets that look like sets - the movie features some dazzling hallucinogenic nightmare visions and at least one recurring image that's memorable - skyscrapers rise up out of the streets as the city 'remakes' itself in tandem with the humans' shifting mental landscapes. At the same time, Proyas can't tell a straight story, and even his most arresting images are derivative (that churning building stuff is cribbed from the pirate-ship fantasia Terry Gilliam designed for 'Monty Python's The meaning of life'). Rufus Sewell, with his Romanesque handsomeness, has an alluring tormented presence, but he's playing a cipher - a man robbed of a memory, and of dramatic dimension, too. 'Dark city' is so busy trying to blow your mind, it never reveals a mind of its own.",Null,0,1,17 April 2000
Gone with the Wind," Old glory
","For contemporary moviegoers 'Gone with the wind' offers a veritable shock of pleasure - more than a gorgeous monument, 'Gone with the wind' along with 'Citizen Kane' is probably the darkest movie ever produced within the studio system. A riveting tragedy of neurotic self destruction, it fixes its gaze on Scarlett O'Hara, the firebrand Dixie princess, as she ricochets with blind abandon between her Southern belle fantasies and her ruthless heart, between her abstract crush on Ashley Wilkes and her hunka burnin' lust for Rhett Butler (the man she hates herself for loving becomes he's as big a scoundrel as she is). The film begins as a bedazzled historical romance, but in the haunting final hour morphs into a Technicolor-gothic 'Scenes from a marriage' with Vivien Leigh - now flirting, now raging, now smiling at heaven through tears - etching an indelible vision of feminine strength and self delusion. To see 'Gone with the wind' is to weep for the fearlessness with which Hollywood once believed the sublime was possible.",Null,0,0,16 April 2000
