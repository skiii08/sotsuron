It," Pretty pictures but it misses a believable bottom to build upon.
","I remember fallingbasleepnwith the old version when I was young, never saw it again.
This movie looks good and has most of the ingredients to make it work. The Reason why it all happens is so vague and sloppy that you cannot identify with it.. You keep on waiting for a reasonnwhy Derry is such a scary village..and why there was this explosion in thebpast..and why a clown.. parallel the characters develop and they get ready forna confrontation but because you don't feel any pressure, no cause and effect, it just doesn't hit you. So it remains a collection of bloody happenings with even not a real ending. If a follow-up will be produced it misses this ground too and therefore the right to excist. .. A missed opportunity fro my perspective.",5,1,1,17 August 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Only for Americans
","The actors are great, the looks are superb and the music is as it should be.. but after a thirth scene in a car with some 'time appropiate' music you start to wonder what the movies purpose really is.
It feels useless.. It is not a documentary but it should be. It's a bit of a drama movie I guess.. the action well.. the last 5 minutes of the movie feel like it had to be put in there somewhere.. But because the slowness of the movie it never fits..
I felt like I waisted time when I left the cinema and I am sure nobody ment it to be like that. But I am not an American.. for Americans it should be sweet history I can only asume..",3,5,9,13 January 2020
Bram Stoker's Dracula," An instant classic (for many years already)
","If you like horror and suspense that isn't lost in effects or the lack of a good story or acting you have to watch this.I am getting tired of vampire stories all together though once in a while I do give it a chance. I have seen this when it came out and saw it many times after. The scenery dresses the acting.. so many details you won't see the first time. I always bring up this movie when talking about classics or cinematic quality to friends. Although I am not an Keanu Rieves or Gary Oldman fan they do play perfectly to the story.I is not a fast pace movie with constant flashing action, but it never gets boring and almost every scene could be a painting... go and watch with your better half with chips and and a drink and you'll be impressed :-)",9,1,5,26 July 2014
