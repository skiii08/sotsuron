Vertigo," Vertigo
","Vertigo is awesome film. Vertigo is not horror film, but is weirdness film. Hitchcock tried to do the new shot for the first time. This shot named 'the vertigo shot'. Hitchcock likes blond hair. Madeleine is heroine, has blond hair, but ex-fianc√©e Midge is brown hair because Midge isn't Scottie's lover. In Vertigo, there are many something expresses vertigo. When Scottie is caught by something, an object likes appears that likes vertigo. For example, Madeleine's hair, she rolls up her hair, and a spiral staircase. I also notice preparation. Scottie has a stick. When Midge and Scottie are in her room, Scottie finds a bra and he points it by his stick. This scene expresses sex. I think Hitchcock likes preparation.",10,2,4,15 September 2014
Taxi Driver," Taxi Driver
","I never watch young Robert De Niro until then. He is so cool. He acts a man, Travis, has a sense of justice, but he eats junk food and watches a pornographic film. He is inconsistent. Travis is taxi driver. He hates the world that he lives, but drives taxi. If I don't like the world, I works in my house, or office. Why does he work outside? Travis is a good man. He wants to change the world. In Taxi driver, Travis often sees a back seat in a mirror of taxi. Hitchcock likes to incorporate his sexual expression in his films. Peep is incorporate in Taxi Driver. Peep is doing gaze from a hall. I also like the music of the opening and ending. The same music is used.",10,4,7,15 September 2014
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Terminator2
","This is the best action film. Arnold Schwarzenegger appear in many action films, but Terminator is the best I think. In Terminator series, I like Terminator2 and 3. Terminator 2 is Arnold Schwarzenegger is so cool. At the ending, T-800(Arnold Schwarzenegger) chooses dying. He does thumbs-up. I like this scene and more that John teaches T-800 words in fashion. No matter what people say, I like the action scene. The best scene is a one-to-one fight in the factory. T-800 looks lose at once, but he comes back. When, the red lump shines. T-800 is very cool. I never watch Terminator 4. I want watch it. Terminator is five series. I know the story of Terminator 1 to 4, but I don't know the story of Terminator 5.",8,1,2,15 September 2014
Psycho," Psycho
","I had even heard the famous music in Psycho before I watch this film. There are many preparations in it. First of all, Norman talks with Marion. There is a stuffing of a raven at his back. The stuffing is a hint in Psycho. Norman has double characters- Norman and His mother. His mother is violent and loves Norman, her son. She tries to prevent to take Norman by women. The stuffing represents her. It likes a mask. Second, A toilet and an overflow of a bath expresses something. It is death and despair because it is pitch-dark within overflows. I pick up two hints. Final, I remember the mummy of Norman's mother. I like this movie.",10,1,2,15 September 2014
The Sixth Sense," The Sixth Sense
","It is the awesome movie. I like the casting. Dr. Malcolm Crowe is Bruce Willis. Cole Sear is Haley Joel Osment. Their acting is good. In Japanese edition, Dr. Malcolm Crowe says 'There is a secret in this movie.' at the beginning. Just like that, there is the big surprise in this film. Before I watch this, I think it is horror movie, but it is sad and little oppressive. Dr. Malcolm doesn't death himself, but Cole knows everything. They become friends, and Cole becomes open, but at the ending, they say good-bye. Dr. Malcolm never talk his wife. This film is sad story. The Sixth Sense is my recommendation. I want to watch it again.",10,0,1,15 September 2014
