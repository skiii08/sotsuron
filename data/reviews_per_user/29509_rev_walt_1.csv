Casablanca," Single best movie ever
","Casablanca is, all things considered, the best movie ever made. The casting was superb, especially since that this picture was actually made as a 'B' movie. The plot has everything, drama, excitement, love, and includes an ending that wouldn't be used in today's offerings. If some hotshot modern producer attempts to remake this classic, I wish him eternity in a locked room with only Marx Brothers comedies to view.",10,0,0,27 September 2000
