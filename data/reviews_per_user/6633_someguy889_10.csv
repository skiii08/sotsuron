The Ring," Enjoyable Movie
","The Ring is a film starring Naomi Watts and Daveigh Chase (from Donnie Darko and Spirited Away). Personally, I did not find this movie scary, even the infamous 'walking out of the TV' part. It follows a woman who is trying to uncover the mystery of a mysterious videotape and why people die 7 days until they die. Naomi Watts is that woman and she is a journalist and very good at uncovering the mystery, while both she and her son must race against time because they have both received the mysterious phone call saying they had seven days. This is a movie that does not follow the conventional, commercial means of getting a cheap scare, and it is above average with its intelligence. The answers to all of the mystery are very interesting, but sometimes this movie borders on silliness. It was remade from the Japanese movie Ringu, which is much more praised and also much more scary. Both of these movie use the use of technology as means of fright: videotapes, telephone calls, etc. This is an enjoyable movie, but not very scary.My grade: 7/10",6,0,0,7 June 2004
Citizen Kane," Rosebud **Spoilers Herein**
","**SPOILERS HEREIN** You have been warned.The sled is not the answer, and Citizen Kane knows it. Yet almost all of the film is told in flashback to discover what Charles Foster Kane's last words meant. The sled was `rosebud,' and finding this out in that last scene is nothing short of satisfying. A sixty year old sled cannot explain a man's life or answer and any lingering questions about him, and yet knowing that Rosebud was his childhood sled is one of the most satisfying `answers' to a mystery in cinematic history. 	Charles Foster Kane's entire life is told in a flashback through a journalists eyes (we're always looking through his eyes because we always see his back). Through a newsreel, there is the Kane who `spoke for the common man' yet had the largest estate in America. Through his bank-owning guardian Thatcher, there is the Kane who squandered his fortune for a small newspaper and started those despicable tabloids. Through his best friend Leland, there is the Kane who wrote a dubious Declaration of Principles and went against everything it stood for years later, and who chose his mistress over his political career. Through his admiring assistant Bernstein, there is the Kane who entertained millions, and who wrote Leland's bad review for Susan Alexander (`sure, everyone knows that story').  Through Susan Alexander, there is the Kane who made shadow figures on the wall but never gave her anything she really cared about. There is the Kane through Thomson, the journalist, who says: `You know, in a way, I kinda feel sorry for the man.' 	Kane was always a man who people couldn't quite figure out. He was a man who saw what he wanted and knew how to get it. But it is obvious, through Orson Welles' superb acting, that Kane wants something more than just material goods or power. He is never seen admiring one of his statues or gazing at one of his paintings. Mainly, he wants love. He cannot truly love so he wants double the love for himself. He creates his own love, only to learn that love cannot be created. He creates a political appearance, so that people may hate the opposition and love him. He even creates an operatic career out of his second wife, so that people may love what he has produced. This is the Kane that the people around him could sense. Leland, Susan, even Thomson, all saw the Charles Foster Kane who had lost almost everything he had, and just could not fathom that love too could be lost.	Then there is the Kane who is alone. Even though all of his life is told in flashback and all of the events were witnessed by someone, there are intimate scenes in which a man is revealed who was surrounded by people and yet died alone. There is the boy playing outside in the snow while his parents determine his future. There is the Kane (his face hidden in shadow) clapping longer than anyone else for Susan's performance. There are the many Kanes reflected through parallel mirrors. There is the Kane letting out all his anger and he destroys Susan's room and his mistakes. There is the Kane who utters `Rosebud' before he drops the wintry ball and dies. RosebudÂ… Bernstein seems to think it was something that he remembered  and wished he had from a long time ago. Leland thinks it was something he lost. Thomson thinks both: `He got everything he wanted, and then lost it. Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn't get, or something he lost. Anyway, I don't think it would have explained everything. I don't think any word can explain a man's life. No, I guess Rosebud is just a piece in a jigsaw puzzle... a missing piece.' The sled is what young Charlie Kane loves and plays with in the snow, and also uses in a feeble attempt to escape from Thatcher. The sled is what Charlie was reminded of when Thatcher tried to give him a new sled for Christmas. The sled is a satisfying `ending' for reasons that are hard to put into words. The sled is the core of the stunted development of Kane's private life. It is the symbol of hope, innocence, longing and security. It is the origin and a reminder of a time before greatness. It's a `what if.' But when Charles Kane dies, for him, Rosebud is love.

Memento," Shamelessly Twisting
","Memento, an independent thriller starring Guy Pearce, Carrie Ann-Moss, and Joe Palantino and directed by Christopher Nolan, has earned a lot of praise recently and is extremely high on the IMDB Top 250 list. This is not a real-life gritty movie, nor it is fantastical. It is not your average Film Noir type thriller, nor is it your average 'twist at the end' thriller. This is one of the most confusing movies ever made, and to say that it's not in chronological order would be putting it lightly. But, if you like movies with lots of twists and lots of psychological turns, then this is one of the best out there. It follows a man with short-term memory loss, played by Pearce. He reminds himself of who/what/where/when/why he is with photographs. But as his past and mission emerges, and the pieces fit more and more together, this movie just gets better and better. This is a very good movie, and as I said, if you like puzzles, you can't get much better than this. My grade: 8/10",8,0,2,7 June 2004
The Terminator," It's never left.
","The Terminator is a 1984 movie starring Arnold Schwarzennegar and Linda Hamilton, and it is independent. James Cameron made this before he got the big bucks from Aliens and went on to make Terminator 2: Judgment Day. But to this day I consider this his best movie, because of the independent qualities that it has. Arnold's character has become classic now, and Cameron builds tension and real, actual horror from this creation instead of relying solely on special effects. This movie is called a thriller but should also be called a horror, because the way the Terminator chases Linda Hamilton and Nick Stahl is something to be truly feared, even if he is a robot. This movie is a futuristic allegory, full of meaning, full of thrills. One of cinema's most famous lines is 'I'll be back.' and it is from this movie. But this movie has never left. It's remained and grown stronger, and it will for quite a while.My grade: 9/10",8,0,1,7 June 2004
Sleepy Hollow," Surprisingly Addictive
","I went into this movie, having already seen Planet of the Apes, thinking that it was going to be another unsucessful Tim Burton movie, but I was surprised. Sleepy Hollow is strengthened by Burton's fantastic visual imagination and Johnny Depp's wonderfully pale performance. No wonder they always say 'From the imagination of Tim Burton comes a new film...' because this 'horror' movie could have easily sucked. However, this is a film more darkly beautiful and strangely humorous than it is scary. Miranda Richardson is the weakest part of the movie, and she makes the last 1/3 of the movie the worst part, but with an amazingly comic, out of breath Icabod Crane by Depp, and further strengthened if not outdone by Burton's images and the great score, Sleep Hollow can be considered a surprisingly addictive and enjoyable film. Sure, this is definitely not on the same level as Batman, Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, or Nightmare Before Christmas, but for what it sets out to do, it does surprisingly well. The last third of the movie is silly, granted, but it's hard to hate this movie.My grade: 7/10",7,1,2,6 June 2004
Patton," How movies like this should be made.
","Patton, starring George C. Scott as the controversial World War II general, is one of the best war movies, biographies, and just movies period. Deservedly given the Best Picture and Best Actor Oscar, this is how movies like this should be made. Today directors seem to think that movies should be fast and full of flashbacks and fast camera movements, but Patton is a movie that takes its time, reflects on things, and in return gives us one of cinema's best performances and best films. Focusing on the live of George Patton, this movie gives us a grand sense of his military prowess and well as his philosophical and sensitive sides. But it does not sentimentalize things in the least. It begins with one of the greatest speeches in film (and in real life): 'the point of war is not to die for your country, it's to make the other sons of bitches die for their country.' This is a smart and deep movie, full of touching moments, but with such honor, such respectful distance, such truth. It also presents the Germans so fairly.My grade: 10/10",10,3,8,6 June 2004
This Is Spinal Tap," These go to eleven... number one cult movie
","Rob Reiner used to be a good director back in the day, and he made two of the all-time cult classics, This is Spinal Tap and The Princess Bride in the 80s. In a recent poll in some magazine or other, This is Spinal Tap was named the number one cult movie of all time, beating out Harold and Maude, The Shawshank Redemption, Rocky Horror Picture Show, even Freaks. This mockrockumentary is brilliantly funny. Christopher Guest liked the mockumentary style so much that he would use it three more times with Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show, and A Mighty Wind. It is filled with incredibly funny situations... The Stonehedge Concert, not finding their way onto the stage, the concert for veterans, and of course, the ever famous Amplifier going to 11. It is a quietly loud movie, and it is full of fascinating characters, from Rob Reiner's director to the band made up of Michael Mckeon, Harry Shearer, and Christopher Guest, the funniest out of them, who is secretly in love with Michael's character. I didn't really laugh much out loud in this one, but the brilliance of This is Spinal Tap is something special, that is frequently attempted but never equaled. It deserves its cult status, and deserves its status as a great movie.My grade: 8/10",8,0,3,6 June 2004
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," 'Bad breath, colorful language, feather duster... what do you think they're gonna be armed with?'
","After that quote, he goes on to say 'Guns!' But by saying 'bad breath, colorful language, feather duster..' he couldn't be more right on. This movie, done by Guy Ritchie, the same guy who would go on to do the similar and equally entertaining Snatch a few years later, is bloody brilliant. With touches of such predecessors as Trainspotting and Reservoir Dogs, Guy Ritchie was able to make a movie that was at the same time thrilling and funny, with exciting visual and narrative style. The plot is confusing and simple at the same time, only because of the abundance of colorfully language characters, who are all stupid. If it's one thing about Guy Ritchie's films it's that his characters are obviously very dumb, but the ones with even the slightest hint of good sense and good morals will come out a little bit less bruised than the rest. This is an already classic movie with a lot of quirks and a lot of hilarious, exciting, bad-breathed, colorful, feather dusting sequences. Good Cockney acting.My grade: 9/10",9,1,2,5 June 2004
Shrek," Do you know the muffin man?
","Shrek is a computer animated film starring Mike Meyers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy, John Lithgow, and the fabulous Conrad Vernon. It won the first-ever Academy Award for Best Animated Film (by the way, Waking Life was unfairly unnominated...Jimmy Neutron?), and rightly so, even though Monsters Inc. was equally deserving. Shrek was not only one of the funniest Animation/Adventure/Comedy/Family/Fantasy/Romances you'll ever see, but it also holds an important message, especially in Hollywood from which it sprang. Shrek is a sort of rebel. Its statement is simple and clear: anything can be beautiful. You don't have to be doused in makeup and look artificially pleasing to the eye, which is so prominent in Hollywood and therefore prominent in America. Shrek states that beauty lies (yes...) in your heart. But besides its refreshing message and ending, it's also extremely funny. With countless fairy tale references, such as the muffin man, Pinocchio, Robin Hood, Snow White, little red riding hood, etc., this is one enjoyable and clever film. It does has its share of potty humor, but thanks to its ending, and its jokes, it has enough vulgarity to be rebellious and enough beauty to be wonderful.My grade: 8/10",8,1,2,7 June 2004
Goodfellas," The F-Word is used 246 times... and I don't remember a single one
","'After Joe Pesci's mother had seen the film, she told her son that the movie was good, but asked him if he had to swear so much.'
Sure, there have been lots of good gangster movies. But this one seems to be so different. I mean, there's the 'What do you mean I'm funny scene?' There the guy who says everything twice 'I'm gonna go get the papers, get the papers.' There the kid who gets shot in the foot for being slow with the drinks. And there's the amazing story of Henry Hill as he becomes part of the gangster world, becoming friends with fellow gangsters Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, getting involved in drug, murder, crime, while having a wife, having kids, having a mistress, living the good life, getting high, turning in his friends, becoming part of a Witness Protection program, betraying everything that he had and grew to love and hate, doing the right and good thing but missing it all so terribly much in the end, all while giving amazing commentary to the whole movie, with wit, humor, tragedy, and a lot of cuss words. The most truthful and one of the best gangster movies was made in 1990, directed by Martin Scorsese. They were goodfellas.My grade: 9/10",9,1,2,8 June 2004
