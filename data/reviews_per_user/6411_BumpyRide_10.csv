Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This Isn't The Star Wars I know
","Having grown up in the generation of the original Star Wars, and having spent my Summer in the movies watching the first Star Wars installment, upon finally seeing The Phatom Menace, I was scratching my head. This wasn't the Star Wars I fell in love with. In fact there's not much to love about this film. The 'story line' is so convoluted and confusing, and the characters come and go so fast you can't figure out who they are. Lucas should have spent more time on creating an interesting story line worthy of Star Wars instead of relying on so many special effects (I felt like I was in a pinball machine with all the bright colors and glaring sounds) and bizarre costumes to distract us from the threadbare script. I started to watch this installment in hopes of watching 'Revenge of the Sith' but now I have no intentions of seeing it.",4,1,2,8 August 2005
Lifeboat," The Professor and MaryAnn
","Now that this movie has been released on DVD, with quite attractive cover art and extras, I'm sure this movie will find a new audience of devotees. I however, am not one of them. This is not a movie I would want in my DVD collection only because after viewing it several times, there's no appeal to watch it repeatedly. There will be many people who will disagree with this but even Hitchcock made this movie as a pure technical challenge more than for a study between the classes in society (shades of Gilligan's Island). Tallulah Bankhead is perfectly cast bringing in sex appeal and her special brand of acting. This is not a disaster of a movie, there are many good qualities to it but in the end it may be too technical for me thus leaving me cold.",6,5,12,2 November 2005
The Best Years of Our Lives," The Best Movie of Our Lives
","A perfect film (how many times can you say that?) that compliments 'Since You Went Away.' One deals with servicemen, and women, entering the war, and this film deals with them coming home. There are many touching and heartbreaking scenes that are executed so brilliantly yet also so simply. The perfect example is the scene where Milly is clearing the dinner table when the doorbell rings. Suddenly she knows it's her husband, Al. The tenderness of the scene will reduce you to tears. The running theme throughout is how hard it is to return home, from seeing horrors of war, and go back to 'ordinary' life. The men, their families and their country have all changed.",10,1,1,31 May 2006
The Graduate," 'Hello, Benjamin.'
","What a wonderful time capsule. Not being old enough to grasp the entire 'Swinging 60's' movement, I can't help but think this was pretty true to form to what was going on back then. Dustin Hoffman is of course great, but Ann Bancroft steals the movie, dominating every scene even when she's not in it. It must have been quite a risk for her to not only play an 'older woman,' especially in age conscious Hollywood, but also to play so much against 'type.' The music, the clothes, the houses all harken back to when America was discovering not every one lived like Ozzie and Harriet, and that a stiff martini could certainly loosen ones morals. The sexual energy this movie projects oozes across the screen and makes one feel like a voyeur.",Null,88,113,7 December 2004
Some Like It Hot," It Was Hot
","When I was in high school, I worked in a local bookstore in the evenings. One day I happened to come upon a book on Marilyn Monroe. Up until that time, I had a vague idea about who she was but I'd never seen a movie of hers or really knew too much about her. While paging through the book, I was astonished at the pure sexual energy that she generated, even in the printed form, in fact it was so raw that I was kinda turned off by it.Around that time I saw that 'Some Like It Hot' was going to be on TV. I tuned in, trying to fine tune the station (I'm dating myself) and was just able to receive a rather fuzzy picture. I watched in my bedroom and even though the picture quality was very poor, I sat mesmerized. That same sexual energy that Marilyn had in printed form oozed out from my TV set. She had a bright, white, glowing quality to her that just floored me.This movie will always have a special place with me, being the first time I ever heard or saw Marilyn Monroe. After that movie, I was hooked on her for years and years. On a side note, a couple years ago I was able to view her belongings at Christie's auction house. That was the first time I really realized she was real person, and not some confection created by Hollywood.",Null,2,3,10 September 2004
Psycho," Hidden meanings
","I read a college professor's thesis on Psycho years ago. I found it interesting, and I think of several of their ideas every time I see the film. Some of the more interesting ideas follow:1. It's Christmas time, and you see decorations when Marion is leaving town but the movie seems more like Halloween.2. When Marion is changing her clothes in her bedroom, you see her shower head peeking out...foretelling things to come.3. When she buys a newspaper, and folds the paper and puts it in her purse, the word 'OK' is visible. This is particularly noticable when she is at the motel register.4. Her license plate is 'NFB' aka Norman F. Bates.",Null,5,10,26 February 2004
Halloween," Original for it's time
","This movie scared the daylights out of me and in turn I developed a major crush on Jamie Lee Curtis! The creepy music added greatly to the scare factor of this film. I may be wrong but I don't think you ever had a film with such intense killing before. All the 'Nightmare on Elm Streets' and 'Friday the 13th's' came after this movie. As for all the copy cats, even their own sequels and prequels to 'Halloween' never came close to the original for sheer terror in your movie seat. You could probably equate it to 'Physcho' in originality for its time. Having a killer not able to be killed was very unexpected. Unfortunately, it's lost some of it's original freight due to the times we live in along with the abundance of movies that try and out-due each other gore for gore.",8,1,2,2 December 2005
The Queen," The Royals
","This is a rather sad movie. There really seem to be no winners here. The depiction of Queen Elisabeth, which to me seemed to be a balanced, accurate portrayal of her, comes across as being a rather lonely woman. Helen Mirren doesn't chew the scenery here, and the majority of the actors turn in fine performances, but it does come down to Mirrin herself. At times, she truly does look like the Queen but it's her talent that makes us believe we are indeed seeing into the Queen's world, and that world is very sad. With all the riches, it seems her personal life is very barren and cold. Her dysfunctional family offer no assistance to her except perhaps, 'Mummy.' The stag scene was very symbolic to her. It represented her, a lone survivor caught in a world of change and danger. And like the stag, at that time, people wanted her head on a platter. Tradition must be upheld but at what cost? 'The Queen' might be a figurehead but it turns out that she is a woman, capable of making mistakes in judgment.",8,0,1,27 November 2006
Casino Royale," Blonde Ambition
","Finally! All the pretty and silly Bond's of recent years have been swept away and put in their place is the Bond Ian Fleming must have envisioned. Daniel Craig IS Bond from the first glimpse of him photographed in cold black and white. His Bond is cruel, imperfect, emotionally wanting and can take a beating but keeps on ticking. Casino Royale packs an action packed punch from the opening scene where Bond is chasing an animal like man who can climb up girders of a building being constructed using his bare hands and feet, and who can propel himself through narrow openings; to an ending, where again, Bond is in a building, but this time it is collapsing as is Bond's chance to find love. No silliness or wise crack one liners or 'invisible' cars here.His journey is long in the film and he is changed by the end of it. Eva Green pales in comparison to Craig's Bond. Perhaps lovely to look at but she offers little more than window dressing. Her Vesper lacked a fire that would temp Bond to leave MI5, and run away with her into the good night. But these complaints are minor because there is so much about the film that works. An excellent villain (fabulously portrayed), a testy M, with locales that are so incredible you want to call your travel agent and book the next flight to Montenegro.The second half of the film more or less follows Fleming's novel, which has one of the better story lines. Thankfully, the story was not thrown away and replaced with a 'typical' Bond formula. The final scene says it all, but I will not spoil anyone's enjoyment of it, but Bond is definitely back and rightfully so!",9,1,4,20 November 2006
The Birds," Turkey Lurkey
","I've been trying to enjoy this movie for years. The performances for the most part are good, the costumes, sets and certainly the director are all great, but deep down, this movie seems very sterile and cold to me. Maybe the lack of an intriguing musical score is what I miss. Sure, the scene where the children are signing (part of the 'musical' score), and Melanie sits down for a smoke is a classic in movie making, and shouldn't be missed. But I get distracted by Tippi. She's good in one scene, not so good in the next, and the rear projections are jarring and so fake looking. I don't know why Alfred didn't keep up with technology and try a different technique. He used rear screen projection in every movie he made, and you can pick them out each time-just think of the motorboat scene in this movie! I've heard all the metaphors before, what this scene signifies, what this phrase really means, etc., but it doesn't necessarily make a good, interesting movie.",7,2,3,22 June 2004
