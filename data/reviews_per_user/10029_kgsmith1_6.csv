Catch Me If You Can," Great Movie
","It takes a lot for me to recommend spending $7.50 on a movie, but I really do think Catch Me if You Can is worth it.  Based on an amazing true story, I had just as much fun witnessing the many tricks DiCaprio's character used to get around the government as I did the movie itself.I've never had a big problem with DiCaprio, nor have I liked him.  I will say that he did a very good job in this movie, however.  His work as both the arrogant and the fearful child was very good, and Tom Hanks does his usual excellent job.  You can't go wrong with this one.",8,1,2,26 April 2003
Forrest Gump," Best Movie of All Time.
","I can't stress this enough: you must see this movie once in your life. The acting from Tom Hanks is unsurpassed, the storyline captivates you for hours without any pause, and the ending will bring a tear every time.  Movies at IMDB tend to slowly lose rating points after they are released, and that is the only reason I can see for this movie being rated as low as it is. This movie is so good that the first time I saw it, I watched it over again as soon as it ended--the only time I have ever done that for a movie.You can have your Gone With the Winds and your Citizen Kanes.  The greatest movie of all time is Forrest Gump.",10,0,3,26 April 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Good Movie
","While this movie is very good and certianly worth going to the theatre to see, it is far from the top 5 of the greatest movies of all time.The movie follows the Lord of the Rings book series, which I will admit to have never reading so I cannot comment on the closeness it follows to the novels' storylines.  I can, however, comment on the movie itself.The best thing this movie has going for it is the cinimatics.  The vast expanses are simply amazing to watch, but that doesn't make a movie for me. The storyline is very enjoyable, although I felt lost at times without previously reading the books.  By the second hour, I was starting to look at my watch.  Unlike the great three hour plus movies, this one started to drag towards the middle.For a person that isn't enchanted by magical movies, I still found the movie to be excellent and well worth the price of admission.  But one of the greatest movies of all time, it is not.",7,1,2,26 April 2003
Black Hawk Down," Great Portrayal of War
","Although I wish the planning stages had been emphasized more, this movie is still a great portrayal of war and how easily something can go wrong.  In particular, I felt this movie showed the utter brutality of close-in warfare and close combat in general.  This is a not a movie you are going to go see for the explosions, so don't go into it thinking that--just watch an Arnold movie.  However, if you go in expecting to find a compelling tale full of pyrotechnics, this will definately be your cup of tea.",8,0,0,26 April 2003
Saw," Great Story, Awful Execution
","Saw (5/10)I usually don't make user comments on a movie, but the great reviews for this film must be remedied.It is quite refreshing to see a, well, 'fresh' concept hit theaters near you. In that realm of movie-making, 'Saw' is a smash-hit. The plot line, well covered by other reviewers, will keep you guessing until the very end. There are a decent amount of plot holes, too many to make the storyline a 10, but not enough to take away your suspense of disbelief.The problem with 'Saw' is the acting and camera-work. There are some scenes acted so poorly in this movie that I could have sworn I was watching 'Detour' again. If a film bases itself around two characters and devotes itself to making the audience care about them, the director better find some good actors. 'Saw' failed miserably in this regard. Why not let Danny Glover have one of the main roles? Why not find the guy who voiced Alf and let him have a main role with Ernest? It would have turned out better than this. Truly horrible acting that completely takes you out of the scene. And even if the acting somehow keeps you compelled, the laughter from the audience at the pathetic 'emotional' scenes will make sure you lose interest in whether these characters survive. In fact (Spoiler), I even forgot one of the main characters escaped at the end of the movie--I just didn't care.Bottom line: A great story with horrible execution. I know horror fans haven't had a decent story to work with since 'The Ring,' but this acting was flat-out inexcusable.Recommendation to avoid. Hard to laugh at because of the story, but hard to take seriously because of the actors...not a lot of fun to be had here.",5,0,0,31 October 2004
Bruce Almighty," 8 FOR A JIM CARREY MOVIE?!?
","I kind of questioned myself when I checked in an 8, but the movie is simply that entertaining.First of all, I don't go into movies looking for something the movie shouldn't be.  This movie is a comedy; so if I can laugh through it and enjoy myself, it has served it's purpose well.  There were plenty of funny scenes in Bruce Almighty, but what really impressed me was the storyline and execution.For once, a comedy's storyline actually works well and holds interest throughout the movie.  While more could have been done with it, the major points were covered, and everything that needed to be there was fit in within the running time of the movie.I thought the acting by Carrey was quite good, and Anniston was adequate. Morgan Freeman, as always, played a superb role and it may have influenced my opinion on this movie somewhat because my vision of God is very similar to how Freeman portrays him.  The scene where God asks Bruce to help mop the floor is something I could very well see God doing.Regardless of whether you believe in the more humorous portrayal of God, it will not damper your interest in this movie.  With a good plot and a lot of laughs, it's a cant-miss for the summer.  If your date is going to drag you to a movie, you can do a LOT worse.",7,0,1,27 June 2003
