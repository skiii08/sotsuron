The Legend of Bagger Vance," 'Pulp Fiction'. Less F-words, though
","I saw this movie and watched it again, as it had so many moments of pure enjoyment in it. Yep, I admit, Smith's black slang advices need to be accustomed to - yep, I admit, Damon and Theron could've done it way back throughout the movie already and yep, I admit, not knowing anything about Golf might make it hard to appreciate the flick.However, I'm not a Golfer myself and so I get the faint feeling that this is yet another movie produced for Europe, accepting that the original crowd wouldn't get it anyway. I had the same feeling about 'The Sports Pages' (http://imdb.com/title/tt0218624/). I hope that there is nothing wrong with Golf movies in general. Not that I'm a golfer but I plan to become a caddy during spare time.",Null,0,1,1 March 2004
Batman Begins," Nice entertainment theatre
","Thanks to Tim Burton's Batman (1989), I will always be in a movie theatre when there's a new Batman feature shown, even though with the set of sequels the subject gradually declined from Batman Returns (which was unnecessarily bad) down to Batman and Robin (which was bad enough to be reason for a law suit).Anyhow, Batman Begins is different in the sense that it is actually good. The plot is plausible, the acting is convincing, the story is enthralling with a nice twist towards the end (as usual I was the last to expect that) and they have the coolest Batmobile by far. It remains to be seen, though, how Batman would be satisfied with the subsequent Batmobile models.But the coolest fact of 'em all is, that the Gotham City Cops drive Mercs throughout the film! Unless, of course, I was so tired I mistook a Hyundai XG for a real Mercedes (I watched the 12a.m. - Midnight - special Preview, and all this on a school night).Summary: if you watch this movie, you won't regret it!",Null,1,2,16 June 2005
