Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Emperor has no clothes!
","Let me say at the outset that I am a Star Wars Fan. I own all three original movies on video and have watched them many, many times. Watching Phantom Menace made me realize that while all of the Star Wars movies are entertaining, none of them are particularly great movies.People complain about the lack of character development in this movie and they are right. But the original characters are all very two dimensional as well. I remember watching SW for the first time and regretting it when Obiwan was killed because I didn't think we had gotten to know his character.People complain about the quality of acting in this movie, and the are right. But Mark Hamil was never in danger of winning an Ocsar either. And let's be honest, it's not the best work of Harrison Ford's career.I don't understand people's complaints about the amount of computer animated creatures in this movie. It makes no difference to me whether a creature is computer drawn, a manipulated puppet, or a guy in a suit. None of them look particularly real to my eye. Who hasn't watched the first three movies and noticed creatures that looked like cameos from the Muppet Show?But, as a Star Wars movie, this one was very entertaining. It answered a question or two and raised a few more. It is wonderfully made, and very fun to watch. And one final note: I did not find Jar Jar as annoying as many folks did. The creature that drove me nuts was that undersea king who kept shaking his cheeks and slobbering.",Null,0,1,2 June 1999
Armageddon," Be serious!!!
","I wasn't going to rent this movie, figuring it would be a waste of time. I decided to take a chance on it, and I discovered I was very wrong. It was a colossal waste of time. I kept laughing out loud at how absurd it was. As I told my kids, 'Beauty and the Beast' is more believable! I am a Sci-Fi fan, and willing to suspend my belief - but this was completely incredible. From the ridiculous refueling fiasco, to the landing on the asteroid, to the flying armadillo (and the list goes on and on), it was totally absurd! I would expect that any junior high kid with a decent collection of action figures could write a more plausible story!",Null,0,2,14 March 1999
Good Will Hunting," Deep insight into human relationships
","I love this movie for its depth of insight into human relationships. I am amazed that two young men could write this film. Yes, I could do without the continual bombardment of foul language, but I believe it to be honest to who the characters are. I am saddened to read comments from other viewers who seemed to have completely missed the point. And for those folks who pointed out in the 'Goofs' listings all the math errors they could find, put down your slide rules and calculators and notice the people in the film! It's a shame this movie came out the same year as 'Titanic,' because it deserves Best Picture. I bought this video because its message touched me deeply.",10,0,1,20 January 1999
The Matrix," Great Film
","Thought provoking, entertaining, new, fresh, a very great film. Superb special effects that serve the story, not vice versa.I don't quite buy all of the symbolism attested to in these pages, but a film like this lets you draw your own conclusions.See the film, search your own heart. Have you found Neo for yourself?",9,0,0,5 December 1999
Tarzan," Very Good Movie!
","My family really enjoyed this movie. It may be a little intense for very young children. The scenes dealing with the parents' death and the villain's demise, as well as some of the chase sequences may be a bit much for them.My only complaint, and this is with most movies these days: Why is the music mixed so loud that you can't hear the words being sung? We're waiting for video so we can watch it on TV with CC turned on to get the words.All in all this is a very exciting movie with genuine laughs along the way. Much more than I can say for a certain wild western movie this summer.",8,2,3,22 July 1999
