Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," My favourite movie since Braveheart.
","I see a movie every week or two and only 3 times have I gone to see a movie twice. In 1986 I saw Aliens twice, in 1995 I saw Braveheart twice and in 1999 I have seen the Phantom Menace twice.This was a wonderful movie. There was so much to see and experience. I was expecting a bad movie since it was so severley panned by critics. It came as quite a surprise though when I finally watched it in the theatre.My only complaint comes in the form of Jar Jar Binks. While I realise he was there for comic effect, any character as clumsy and buffoonish as him would have been killed long before getting into this movie. However he was easily ignored and I noticed that kids found his antics funny.There has been some complaints about the performances, but without exception they range from good to very good.",9,0,0,23 May 1999
