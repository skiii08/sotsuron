Casablanca," The perfect movie
","Casablanca is a classic that defines film at its greatest. This has pretty much become common knowledge. The film has many dimensions inside its story. The romance between Rick and Ilsa is unique and fantastic, but this film is much more than a love story. It's a story of redemption, glory, and enlightenment. The social implications in the film are very relevant for the time period its in. The script is one of the best parts of the film by far. The dialog is beautiful and poetic. As much as auteur directors are well-respected and usually more liked than directors with no distinct flare, Michael Curtiz directed some wonderful films without the audience being aware of his direction.",10,3,4,4 May 2013
Citizen Kane," Rosebud
","This film was aesthetically beautifully and technically impressive. However, the plot itself was a bit too slow-moving and boring for me. I read a little back story on this film because I think it makes movies inherently more interesting if they have history. The fact that it was based off of William Randolph Hearst and that Hearst tried very persistently to stop it from coming out made the movie much more fascinating. The striking cinematography was the most enjoyable part of the movie. The camera tricks and lighting techniques were new and unprecedented for that era. Orson Welles' style truly shined in this film. The fact that the entire movie was based on trying to figure out the meaning behind a dying man's last word was what really threw me off. It seemed unrealistic and I think there could have been better ways to tell the story.",6,0,3,5 May 2013
Taxi Driver," You're talking to me?
","This film was excellent. No other way to phrase it, really. De Niro is an incredible actor in everything he does; but this movie was good for more reasons than just De Niro's unmatchable talent. The message of the loneliness and torture inside a disturbed mind is one that is not frequented enough by film. Yet one could argue that it is one of the most important phenomenons to be aware of. In an age where random violence is becoming increasingly more prevalent and excessive media coverage is bringing these stories of real-life horrors into everyone's living rooms, it seems bizarre that as a society we are not more interested in the abnormal psychology of the human mind. The irony of Travis' loneliness in the middle of New York City, one of the most densely populated areas in the country, is another thing that brings meaning to this film. Loneliness is a state of mind; not something that happens just from physical isolation from people. The final scene was hard to watch, I'll admit. The ugliness of the raw violence was almost too much for me to handle. But I also found some realness in this murder scene that doesn't seem to appear in movies as much today. This film was absolutely excellent and I highly recommend it!",10,0,0,5 May 2013
The Grapes of Wrath," Dust Bowl
","The Grapes of Wrath was a remarkable story of a family's struggle during the Great Depression. The story was unbelievably sad and seemed very realistic. It's interesting that this event was reenacted into film so close to the era that it actually took place. Ma Joad was my favorite character because of her determination to keep the family together. In such trying times, it appeared to be very hard for the family to appreciate each other. An idea that I found to be odd, I always assumed that it was struggles such as this one that brought people closer. The black and white cinematography really helped portray the desperation and hopelessness emotion of the film.",8,0,1,4 May 2013
Annie Hall," Wonderully sad and tragically beautiful
","Annie Hall was a beautiful movie. Woody Allen's non-linear story of this romance was so real. His comedy always gets me. The moments when he stepped out of the story and spoke into the camera were really great. The fact that the entire thing was a narrative also added a flare of Allen to it. It was a real story; filled with symbolism and dream sequences and allegories. It was sad because it showcased more so the falling out of love instead of the falling in love part of relationships. This might be the saddest part of life, and Allen depicts it gracefully. The movie made me very sad because they were such a spectacular couple. Watching their love wither and die was hard to see; but you have to respect the reality of it.",10,0,0,4 May 2013
The Graduate," Plastics
","This film encompasses the revolutionary (sexually in particular) period of time in between the 50s and 60s. It's metaphorical for the rise and fall of the American dream. It's also symbolic for what the country as a whole was going through in the late 60s. Benjamin's disdain for the transition period of post-collegiate life into adulthood is depicted beautifully. It's something anyone can relate to. The older generation's expectations of Benjamin and his clashing ideals on life is extremely comparable to a dilemma that many young adults face. The scandalous plot is a nuance for Hollywood at this period in time, yet it's beautifully done. The debauchery and rebellion of the younger generation is very characteristic of this period in American history. This film was fantastic.",9,0,0,4 May 2013
Singin' in the Rain," Oh, Sinnnnnnngin' in the Rain!
","This film was not one that I enjoyed; however I could appreciate the elements of the film that deemed it a classic. I'm not a fan of musicals to begin with, and the dialog was pretty corny, but the plot and the choreography was impeccable. This film successfully managed to tell two stories parallel to each other: the romance between Kathy and Don and the way that the industry dealt with the turning point of cinema (sound). The dancing was flawless and the costumes were vibrant and beautiful. Some of the humor was enjoyable. 'Make 'Em Laugh' was a funny song and the physical comedy was entertaining. The choreography during the song that Don, Kathy and Cosmo sang together was perfect.",6,0,0,4 May 2013
Psycho," Cinema's finest moment
","Psycho is a timeless, well-respected classic. It's a pop culture icon and a household name. Just hearing the movie's title will inspire the image of Janet Leigh screaming in the shower. Hitchcock did this movie flawlessly - it almost seems silly to review this film because it's common knowledge how perfect it is. The acting is absolutely impeccable. I would almost say that Tony Perkins played Norman Bates too well because he was never really able to be anything ever again. The similar paradox of Bela Lugosi, who could never escape his 'Dracula' image. I was lucky enough (lucky only for the fact that it gave me an extra element of analysis ability of the original) to see the re-make of Psycho. The movie was pretty much a duplicate, yet just not as good. It's sometimes hard to identify perfect acting, because that's the whole point of it: to not notice the acting. But after watching the shot-for-shot remake and realizing it was no where near as good as the original, my respect for the actors and the black and white cinematography grew even deeper than it already was. Hitchcock's ability to do horror without gore is fantastic.",10,0,0,5 May 2013
