10 Cloverfield Lane," Great claustrophobic story with fine performances... and a twist
","Full disclosure: The year is 2007. A trailer hits cinema screens advertising a mysterious film named 'Cloverfield.' Nobody knows what it's about, except that it's riding on the wave of the found footage genre, and that it seems to depict a giant monster attack on New York. Speculation immediately breaks out all over the internet, but nowhere more fiercely than on the IMDb forums, with many folks being caught up in the genius viral marketing. I myself was one of those people, along with my wife. Yes, we met on IMDb's Cloverfield forum. She moved from the US to Australia a few years after, we got married, and we've lived together happily ever since.Yes, that is the power of film; it can bring people together in the most unlikely ways possible.So, it's with some excitement that we were blindsided by the brief and vague advertising campaign for 10 Cloverfield Lane. Does it have any connections to the original Cloverfield? What's JJ Abrams playing at here, exactly? Without giving too much away, it's not a direct sequel, but rather a sequel in tone. I'm assuming Abrams is going for an anthology style series here, with each entry being a different story tied together by their themes and science-fiction setting. It's clearly a marketing thing, but if that means we'll get more films like this, I'm certainly okay with it.10 Cloverfield Lane eschews its predecessor's found-footage trappings, and immerses us in a classic style bottle thriller. The setting is limited and claustrophobic, and the cast small, but the story and tension will grab you and not let up until the end. The nature of the mystery means your opinion will hang very precariously on whether you like that ending, and I suspect it will be divisive. There's not a great deal of resolution, and if I'm correct in assuming this will be an anthology series from now on, I doubt we'll ever get any. But that's fine, because I don't think the story that would follow the film really needs to be told.What matters are the performances. John Goodman is the real draw card here. He gives a stunning turn that is delightful, sympathetic and absolutely terrifying in equal doses. He's had so many great roles in the past, but he is unforgettable here. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is also very likable as the resourceful protagonist. Perhaps a little too resourceful at times, but for the most part we're with her happily throughout.The film looks fantastic despite the cramped environs, with great use of color and shadow and some interesting cinematography. There are some nice designs and special effects toward the end of the film, even if they may be considered a little derivative. The score is tense and effective, and keeps you on the edge of your seat.The script is great with very little flab, and if you like these kinds of stories which lock characters together in tight, paranoid spaces then you'll find a lot to enjoy here. Just don't go in expecting Cloverfield 2, because this is not it. It's its own beast, and has a brave ending that you'll either love or hate.",8,165,258,9 March 2016
Green Room," Horror will always be punk rock!
","Recently, director Guillermo Del Toro wrote a series of passionate tweets praising his contemporary John Carpenter, and lamented his relative lack of success when taking into account his incredible talent and catalog of classic directorial efforts. Del Toro capped off the tweet-storm with the proclamation that, 'Horror will always be punk rock!' While I'm more of a heavy metal person, I agree with the sentiment. The best horror will always exist on that line just outside the mainstream, in realms that the 'normal folk' don't want to tread.Jeremy Saulnier's Green Room is literally one of those punk rock-type films that Del Toro is talking about, and appropriately follows a young punk rock band in their attempt to scrape up a living with their musical talents. They're playing in seedy bars and living in their van when they manage to secure a gig at a secluded venue owned and frequented by white supremacists. Things go way downhill when they witness a murder and become trapped in the titular green room by some very nasty individuals.While the plot and tone are reminiscent of certain chainsaw massacres and their ilk, the punk rock aesthetic lends an air of originality, and the dark, grimy tone is set early and successfully in the piece. It's clear that this movie refuses to pull any punches. The violence is graphic and unflinching, bringing to mind the style of grue that was so popular in the French new wave of the 2000's. This is what real horror fans have come to see. None of that PG-13 bullshit. We're here for the flesh being torn, busted bones hanging limply, and screams of pain and terror. On those accounts, Green Room delivers, but at the same time doesn't become gratuitous. Although the folks seated a few rows across from us who walked out presumably wouldn't agree.There's a realism to the approach taken by Jeremy Saulnier, who also directed 2013's fantastic Blue Ruin with similar flair. It's filmed in a somewhat documentary-style, with great use of shadow and uneasy color tones. The soundtrack is authentically punk, underscoring the on screen mayhem with an appropriate aural backing.The cast is likable and feel genuine, and we're quickly on board with them through their trial. Macon Blair (who also starred in Blue Ruin) is of particular note, and Patrick Stewart's turn as a calm, collected neo-nazi is very fun - although I was left wanting a little more.As the film progresses, it feels as though there is a rush toward the end. The first half is wrought with tension, but the second half sadly loses its rhythm, and the ending feels anticlimactic. After the fantastic setup, it's a shame the story takes the direction it does, and saddles the characters - particularly the villains - with some questionable actions and decisions. Things unravel too quickly. Far more could have been done with the toys the filmmakers had to play with here.Even if I wasn't entirely convinced by the way it ended, I appreciate what was achieved with Green Room. I love Saulnier's style, and the atmosphere he wrings from his work is unique and filled with dread. I also love the gore effects, which appear to be almost entirely executed via traditional, practical methods. While perhaps not as strong as Blue Ruin, this film is refreshing in its ability to make us squirm and wince. With a little more work, this could have been a real classic, but as it stands, it's a solid, visceral horror/thriller with a novel setting and I can't wait to see what nastiness Saulnier drags us into next.",7,1,7,24 May 2016
Terminator Salvation," Doesn't live up to the classic original and first sequel.
","I actually enjoyed it more than I thought I would. The movie is not as bad as some would have you believe. The action was impressive... sound design was great. It was top notch from a visual and aural standpoint, apart from the shaky cam during the action, which gets a bit much.The story was OK... but there was a bunch of problems with it. For one, Skynet was completely, and utterly retarded. Why wouldn't it kill Kyle Reese straight away? And how would it even know he's John Connor's father, unless it had access to the police and hospital videos from T1 and T2? Why was Skynet kidnapping people when it was clearly established in T1 and T2 that its only goal was to destroy humanity? And why did Skynet need big screen monitors? And keyboards? It's a farking computer program! And then why did Skynet have to give a Bond villain speech using Helena Bonham Carter's face? I'm usually OK with retarded stuff in movies. In general I can forgive it, but when it comes from a pedigree like Terminator... I mean, come on. The writing was pretty weak as a whole, but at least there were a bunch of little nods to the previous films that I enjoyed.Christian Bale seemed to have phoned in his performance. Sam Worthington was pretty good - looks like Hollywood has a new action hero. Go Australia! ;) Anton Yetchin was pretty decent as a young Kyle Reese... BUT - that rapper guy sucked. Moon Bloodgood sucked. The little afro kid sucked. All three characters played by these people were completely and utterly pointless and out of place. Cut them all out and you instantly have a better film. Also, the biggest problem with the casting was Bryce Dallas Howard. Too young, too weak, too pretty and make up laden. She's supposed to be 16 years older than Claire Danes was in 2003, and did not look it at all. She's too young and it made no sense. Overall, the acting was pretty hammy and it shows that McG does not have the ability to get good performances out of his actors. Also, Michael Ironside is cool. Too bad he got such a small role.Also, although I DID like the look of the post-apocalyptic world... I thought they should have kept it more in line with the look of the future war in the first 2 movies. The sky darkened by nuclear ash, more vicious, relentless Terminators... People just trying to survive. Even T3 got that right when they briefly showed the future war there.T3 was just a jokey, self-parodying rehash for the most part... BUT... the best parts of T3 were better than the best parts of T4. That said... I did enjoy T4... at least for the action, design, sound and the tiny consistent things they got right. From that standpoint, it was good.",6,1,3,8 June 2009
Resident Evil," Horrible, horrible, horrible movie
","OK, so I'm incredibly bored and this movie is on TV now and I forgot how bad it is. So, I'm going to fill the next hour and a half with this pap and write as I watch. There is not one memorable character in it at all, apart from Milla Jovovich, who I would decline to actually refer to as a 'character'. She spends most of the runtime looking at things with a stupid, wide eyed glare, only taking a break to bullet time kick a dog in mid-air. Oh, and then there's Michelle Rodriguez looking angry, and sounding angry. Scary.Everyone else is just a cardboard cutout, never fleshed out or even given a decent line. They jump through a window at the beginning - I guess that's what Paul WS Anderson considers 'character development'... All the dialogue that follows after that is a bunch of useless, boring exposition. Who are these people and why the hell should I care? There's too many of them, all of them generic and never given anything to do.The film simply looks ugly and drab - nondescript metal corridors and rooms full of boxes and hokey machinery. A talented DP could make this look good, but instead it comes across as overly sterile. And the insulting computer generated map of the facility is just... ridiculous. Could this movie be any more aimed at morons? The zombies are pathetic. The action is poorly filmed. Most of the time we get a shot of someone firing a gun, sometimes in slow motion. The gore level should have been much higher, at least there would have been something to look at, but instead there is barely a drop of blood. Zombies drop to the ground in a bloodless heap while dusty squibs explode sporadically and unspectacularly. Aside from a few shots, you'd think they were aiming for a PG-13. Maybe they were, knowing PWSA.Why PWSA felt the need to stray so far away from the original atmosphere and story of the game is beyond me - surely, a talented writer could have structured a tense, claustrophobic zombie story set in the mansion, with the STARS team as characters? Instead, we got a derivative, half assed rip off of a bunch of different horror/sci-fi/action movies, and none of it works. There is no story here, just a bunch of crappy clichés and poorly orchestrated 'scary jump' sequences where something crashes into a window. No tension at all.You know, there's movies as silly as this one, but they succeed because they KNOW they're silly. They wink at the audience. Instead, PWSA treats his audience with contempt. This is completely soulless, franchise film-making. You just know he came into the suit's office and pitched how he could make a dumb movie on the cheap, and the fans of the game would come in and see it regardless of how bad it was. He didn't even ATTEMPT to make a good movie.Back into another smoky corridor, suddenly filled with zombies. Horrid, obnoxious industrial metal music blares at the viewer while Milla 'kicks ass' in slow motion again. Poorly edited, poorly filmed.Random guy: 'We're all gonna die down here.' Milla: 'No, we're gonna get out. All of us.' Ergh, this is gonna go on for another half an hour isn't it? Oops... Time for some weird flashback. OK, there's an antivirus. Fantastic... Who cares at this point? Oh, and 'Spence' was the guy who released the virus... Who the hell is Spence? I guess he's one of those random cardboard cutouts that have been walking through the movie for the past hour and a bit. He looked so much like 3 of the other background characters, and didn't have barely a line of dialogue, so I would have never suspected him. What a brilliant twist! So now we have a Licker... crappy CG but it's by far the best thing in the movie so far. Too bad every shot of it is so short that we never get to really see it in action. And now we have another classic cliché - the action/thriller countdown, conveniently displayed on screen in big, digital numbers. Oh, and followed up by the return of a character that we all thought was dead! How surprising. I can't wait for the next cliché. Hahah, there it is. 'Spence' is a zombie and he jumped at Milla - shocking! She then uttered a one liner and hit him in the head. Just lucky we have the big green digital watchface counting down to the end of the movie! Can't wait for it to end.So, now the Licker is jumping around inside the train. Sparks are flying everywhere... This must be the 'climax'. Milla just bullet-time shot it in the head. Didn't see that coming... Oh... and it's dead already. That wasn't very impressive. Michelle Rodriguez turned into a zombie and got shot in the head... How tragic. I was so very attached to her 'angry' style of acting.FINALLY! The movie is over - and the last shot was probably the most impressive thing in the movie. It looked kinda cool... But that was very unsatisfying. And now there's some awful, lame nu-metal blasting over the credits. Horrible. Absolutely horrible. PWSA should be ashamed. And if you liked this mess, you should be too.",2,1,8,5 October 2008
District 9," The first science fiction masterpiece in years
","I do not give out ratings of 10 lightly, but here it is - the first film in years that has been deserving of the rating.Neill Blomkamp brings to screens a fantastic, gritty, realistic piece of science fiction with District 9. Not since Ridley Scott's 'Blade Runner', John Carpenter's 'The Thing', or James Cameron's 'Aliens' have we seen a science fiction film with a vision of this caliber. After viewing District 9, it will be clear to one and all why Peter Jackson put so much faith in Blomkamp and took him under his wing as protégé.Abandoning the usual settings of Hollywood sci-fi and placing us in the harsh slums of South Africa, we are given an original piece of work which takes risks in the way it tells its story. Not only does it go against the expectations of audiences who have been trained to expect mediocrity from their sci-fi, it goes above and beyond the call of duty to provide us with spectacle as well as something to ponder after we've downed our popcorn.There is, thankfully, not an overused, overexposed celebrity in sight, and every unknown face in the film gives a solid performance. The aliens themselves, brilliantly realized with top notch CGI even manage to make us feel something, only rivaled by Gollum from 'Lord of the Rings'.District 9 has so much to like. It's spectacular, darkly funny, entertaining and thoughtful all at the same time, and it's all done on a meager $30m budget. There is true talent on show here. If only there were more films like this, the world of cinema would be a more interesting place.",10,2007,2431,13 August 2009
Gran Torino," Good? Yes. Great? No. Too uneven.
","I expected a far more serious film than what was delivered. The themes of racism and redemption were a little too heavy-handed, and sloppily presented. There were several bits of dialogue which were too blatant - the script had no faith in the viewer to figure out what the meaning was, and instead felt the need to have Clint talk out loud to himself, or to the priest in an effort to explain it all for the less bright people in the audience.While the film was intended to illustrate how out of touch Clint's character was, I think the film would have benefited from being a little more natural in the way it presented the younger characters. The script, and staging of many scenes was awkward and worked against the movie as a whole.I enjoyed Clint, and his performance was definitely amusing... but does he deserve an Oscar, or even a nomination for it? I'd say, no.The film simply didn't know what it wanted to be. A comedy? A drama? It never really stuck with one thing, and while sometimes this works well in cinema, it felt a little too uneven here.That said, it is a good movie for sure, but I'd decline to say it's one of the best of the year.The ending was sappy, and Clint singing over the credits was a final nail in the film's credibility.I'd give it a 7/10, for entertainment value alone... But there was too much cringe worthy stuff in there to rate it higher, and honestly, I think I'm stretching in giving it a 7...",7,0,4,31 December 2008
Avatar," Incredible scope and spectacle
","A film with the scope of James Cameron's Avatar was always going to be a risk both artistically and financially, especially in today's economic climate. Whether it will pay off monetarily is a question only time can answer, but this viewer can at the very least attest to it being an artistic triumph.Avatar brings us as close as cinema ever has to actually visiting an alien world. The beautiful environs, the exotic creatures and incredibly lifelike natives of Pandora arrest the senses, visually, aurally and emotionally. The world in Avatar is the true star of the show. The amount of detail and work that has gone into bringing this new world alive is seriously impressive, and it will be a while before we see anything that overtakes it in scope and quality. WETA Workshop and ILM have truly outdone themselves.Relative newcomer, Aussie Sam Worthington provides a solid human heart amongst all the science-fiction/fantasy beauty and Zoe Saldana gives an impressive performance as the 8 foot tall Na'vi, Neytiri. Even though the characters they both play are blue, giant, catlike aliens, they managed to evoke a chemistry and likability that pierces through the special effects.That's not to say that everything is perfect. The story is basic and dare I say, clichéd and predictable. We have seen it plenty of times in all forms of media. The bad guys are cartoonishly evil, and sadly paper thin. The love story, while charming, is also clichéd despite being between man and alien. But in the face of these shortcomings, Avatar is a success because its storytelling lies in the brilliant visuals.Avatar is a beautiful piece of film and a true event. It does exactly what cinema was always intended to - it takes us away from our problems and worries for a few hours and gives us memorable images which will undoubtedly and deservedly enter into the cultural lexicon to stay for the foreseeable future.9.5/10",9,973,1603,16 December 2009
The Dark Knight Rises," Great piece of blockbuster filmmaking
","TDK is a wonderfully made piece of blockbuster entertainment. The technical side of the film makes it a complete joy to watch. The editing, the cinematography, and most of all... the score. Oh, the Hans Zimmer score! I swear half of this film's power comes from the presence of that hammering, pounding score. It's great.Sure, there's a lot of problems. It's far from a perfect film. There's too many characters meaning there's not enough character development or screen-time for the major players.The film moves so fast that the multitude of plot holes come and go before the audience even gets a chance to know they're there - it's only after leaving the cinema that you have time to reflect on what you've seen and certain plot elements begin to unravel. That's one of the problems with Nolan's films - they throw so much at the audience that perceived small things tend to be glossed over. His surgeon-like perfectionism in other areas of filmmaking cause these issues and plot-holes to stick out a lot more than they would otherwise.Even though the script is overly ambitious and at times loses itself amongst its giant cast of characters and weaving plot strands, it manages to tie up the series in an emotionally satisfying way (despite Nolan's usual sterile atmosphere, I felt TDK was even lit like a hospital).As a piece of entertainment, I thought it outdid BB and TDK. For me personally, TDKR is on the same level as the original Burton films. Regardless of what people think of Burton's Batman, that's a big thing for me.",9,5,14,19 July 2012
