The Blair Witch Project," The real terror is one that cannot be seen by the naked eye...
","The folks that did the PR and hype for this film did a so-so job. They hyped this movie so much that it generated huge publicity, but they hyped it the wrong way.  It's not the scariest movie of all time, it's the best scary movie!(understand?)  This movie is about the journey three kids take from being cocky film students, to whimpering, naive, and terrrified little children lost within a dark woods and becoming the prey of an urban legend. Don't expect a witch or gross-looking pyschotic killer to jump out because this movie isn't a slasher flick, it's better than that.  Go to this movie well-educated about its plot and ideas.  Have an open mind and let your imagination run wild.  The back of you neck will tingle, your palms will sweat, and your heart will race during the last 15 minutes of the film, and I'm not telling you why!  The real terror is one that you cannot see, but can only imagine.",10,18,36,3 August 1999
