The Benchwarmers," Absolutely dreadful and totally unfunny
","I didn't laugh a single time at this awful film. I expected something entertaining because I'm a huge fan of 'Happy Gilmore' and I kind of like Rob Schneider and David Spade (I think they're bashed too often). However this film really annoyed me. Its humor was completely juvenile and they even got the actor from 'Napoleon Dynamite' to play an almost IDENTICAL dorky character - only even less funny! It's a real pain to sit through and I have to warn you that I tried, but couldn't manage to laugh a single time.Not even the cameo by Jon Lovitz put a smile on my face.If I could give 0/10, I would.",1,57,183,23 March 2006
