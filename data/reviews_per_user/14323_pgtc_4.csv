The Incredible Hulk," How much dumber can American script writers get?
","I have to admit I've never been much of an Ang Lee fan, but this pathetic B-movie disaster just pales in comparison to Lee's film. To begin with, the plot (if it can be called that) is so shallow and full of holes that it's embarrassing to see respectable actors like Edward Norton and Tim Roth involved with this mess. An American military airplane heading towards Rio? Brazil is not Iraq. It would have been put down by the Brazilian Air Force in a minute. A vehicle with half a dozen armed guys in a Brazilian favela? The local drug bosses would have gladly used them as target practice. And the cream of the crop, a 'for export' bottled juice factory INSIDE a favela? This will become the joke of the year in Brazil. As to the reviewer from Singapore who wrote '(...)the crowded streets and cluttered housing on the streets of Rio De Janeiro(...)' - for mercy's sake, get a clue and your geography right before writing this kind of nonsense. The scenes take place in a FAVELA, which are poor, isolated parts of the city, not the city itself.There are far FEWER action sequences than on Lee's film, and what there is is so pointless, badly executed and less exciting that the average popcorn eater above 6 years of age will be bored to death. Any self respecting fan of the Hulk comic books will rate this abomination of a movie as low as possible. I gave Ang Lee's film 9 stars, and this one gets 2 only because the CGI work on the Hulk is very well done, otherwise it would have gotten 1 star (since IMDb doesn't allow a 0 star rating).",2,12,22,20 September 2008
Resident Evil," Finally a great game-to-movie conversion!
","Movies based on video games do tend to be disappointing, to say the least, so I was very pleasantly surprised that 'Resident Evil' is so good. I wasn't expecting much from the film, but then it got my attention from the very first minutes and just kept the adrenaline level high all through the story. Nice special effects, good acting and atmospheric music all add to the tension from start to end. The locations do look more like those in the game 'Half-Life' than 'Resident Evil' the game, but that will just make things more interesting for 'Half-Life' players too.",10,0,0,25 May 2003
War of the Worlds," Utterly pathetic
","This is one of the most utterly pathetic movies I've ever seen. Apart from a few nice special effects, everything else is pure trash. There's no real plot, as the script jumps from one unrelated event after another; the characters poorly developed (if at all) and ridiculously superficial; the sound score is uninspired and derivative. Tom Cruise's character seems to spend most of his time yelling his daughter's name (Rachel), who in turn spends most of her time annoying viewers with her high-pitched hysterical screams. It all comes as a real shock since we've all grown accostumed to Steven Spielberg's usually top quality output. As a sci-fi fan, I'm used to seeing lots of Z-quality films, but this one doesn't even deserve a letter, or a star - I'm giving it one only because IMDb forces me too. Not even worth renting when it's released on video.",1,1,4,9 July 2005
Signs," Boring and disappointing.
","This must be on my list of the 10 all-time greatest movie disappointments. The potential of the story's concept was so great that it was just infuriating to see it spoiled by mediocre acting, cheap emotional drama and a script that must have been written by some kind of story generation computer program.",2,3,5,25 May 2003
