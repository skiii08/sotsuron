Despicable Me 2," Went to see this in the cinemas yesterday 5/7/13 very good follow up
","Myself and my little brother decided to see this yesterday in the cinemas as the other film that were going to see Epic wasn't on so we had no choice but to watch our Plan B movie Despicable Me 2. Despicable Me 2 is a follow up to the 2010 animated romp that follows on a villain named Gru(voiced by Steve Carrell in a Russian Accent)who was planning to take over the world with his sidekicks the minions and his Professor(voiced by Russell Brand sporting an old man's voice)and wanting to steal the moon,that is until 3 little girls takes his heart and he decides not to be the bad guy anymore. THIS TIME....HOWEVER his adopted daughter Angus is celebrating her birthday but she is missing the most important thing in her family...YUP she doesn't have a mother. So Gru's 3 girls decide to set Gru up on a date but when a mysterious red head named Lucy(voiced by Bridesmaids Kirsten Wigg)comes into his life he teams up with her to take out the new bad villain in town (voiced by an unrecognizable Benjamin Bratt from Catwoman),but of course as they try and take him down,the two (yup you guessed it) they fall in love. So what do I like about this movie; well first off the charcthers and I have to admit but I love the Minions because I'm really not kidding here but these little yellow creatures are SO HILARIOUS especially when they sing there own version of ALL 4 One's I Swear replacing the words with gibberish words and doing a cover of YMCA again with gibberish words. Also I like the music too by Pharell Williams.Now to the negativity; the charcther design for Gru's love interest who is a carbon copy of Audrey from The Lorax(if you seen it she's voiced by Taylor Swift). I mean the hair,the eyes she's LITERALLY a carbon copy of her I mean were the animators lazy not to come up with something different for her design. Also the story has been done before.A single father being roped by his daughter and falls in love and yeah if you seen it you can smell the ending A MILE AWAY.Overall I was glad I saw it yesterday and even my 5 year old brother loved it,as did I(22 a female who loves watching animated movies).Heck I'm giving it a 9 out of 10.",9,1,3,6 July 2013
The Mask," Absolutely hilarious. Jim Carrey owns this film
","This was on TV last night and as I am a fan of Jim Carrey and Cameron Diaz(it was her movie debut)I decided to watch it again.The movie is based on a comic by Dark Horse and it tells the story about a timid mild-mannered man named Stanley Ipkiss(Carrey) who is how shall I put it a kinda guy who wouldn't be a hit with the ladies and is a bit shy. One stormy day and a beautiful young woman named Tia Caryle(Diaz) comes in and Stanley is smitten by her unaware she is the girlfriend of a gangster called Dorian(Greene). One night Stanley is humiliated as the car he had on loan gives up on him on a bridge and he spots something in the river and thinks its a dead body. Turns out its an enchanted mask that has special powers(apparently its suppose to be the god Loki who was banished into this wooden mask many years ago). As Stanley loves cartoons one night he decides to put it on and what do you know it wraps on his face and he twirls around like that Tasmanian devil in the Looney Toons and is transformed into an over the top crazy womanizing cartoon like creature who is dubbed 'The Mask'or as the comics would say Big Head.I loved the part where the mask takes out a condom out of his pocket and does bizarre impersonations of Elvis Presley and some other people. Another is the Hey Pachuco scene with Jim Carrey and Cameron Diaz dancing together.Jim Carrey has to be the most wackiest actors I have ever seen in my entire life. He is so OTT and so loony yet you gotta love the guy as his just so adorable here. Plus his my favourite comedic actor of all time next to Robin Williams. Cameron Diaz was pretty darn good in this flick too as Jim Carrey's love interest Tina Carayle. It may have scare the crap out of me as a child,but having said that its very funny. The special effects are very well done especially the make up effects on Carrey as The Mask done by Greg Cannon.Keep an eye out for a Jack Russell named Milo who is so hilarious and adorable.I'll give it a 7.8/10. Very good.Beware of the sequel Son Of The Mask,it is terrible.Edited on the 15th of July 2019Best part: The Cuba Pete number or anything where Carrey is the mask.Worst Part: Not much of Jim Carrey as The Mask and can be a tad bit scary for a younger audience.",7,0,0,12 November 2010
The Avengers," Surprisingly it was very good
","I seen this a few days ago on TV and I have never seen it before as I have the sequel on DVD so I said I might as well see what the original was all about. The film is about a group of superheros that are Hulk(Mark Ruffalo from 13 Going On 30),Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr from Only You),Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson from We Bought A Zoo),Captian America(Chris Evans who was the human torch in the original Fantastic Four films),Thor(Home & Away's Chris Hemsworth)and of course Hawkeye(played by Jeremy Renner)who are brought together to try and defeat Loki(Tom Hiddleston)who happens to be the god of mischief(yeah you know he was banished inside a Mask that was made into a film years ago with Jim Carrey yup thats Loki alright)and he of course is the brother of Thor(Hemsworth). So will our heroes save mankind and defeat Loki?Bottom line I enjoyed this film,I liked how there was a cameo with Gwyneth Paltrow as Poppy Potts (the love interest of Iron Man Tony Stark),and Samuel L Jackson as the leader who is over The Avengers.The action sequences were great and my favourite characters have to be Iron Man and Hulk if there was a separate movie about these two characters I would definitely be watching it.As for the rest of the movie and cast its all pretty good too. Also watch out for the end of the post credits as the same guy who was in Age Of Ultron at the end of that movie also makes a cameo in this in the end(his a purple faced guy). All I am saying.7/10",7,0,1,1 January 2016
Black Swan," A Horrible overrated film that shouldn't have won all the awards it received
","Black Swan tells the tale of a young woman named Nina(played by Thor star Nataile Portman)who is a ballerina who is auditioning for the part of Princess Odette in Swan Lake as the leading star,but when another inspiring ballerina(played by Friends With Benefits star Mila Kunis)wants the part too,Nina's life spirals out of control and she begins to show her dark side where she transforms into a black swan as you see bumps coming out of her arms and her eye colour changes,as well as hallucinating about seeing herself in person through a mirror.Bottom line don't go expecting Step Up or Save The Last Dance while watching this as its very gruesome and sickening to watch where in one scene Nina visits Beth(Winona Ryder from Edward Scissorhands)who uses a knife and starts stabbing herself in the face,as Nina runs away and she has the knife in her hand with blood covering her hands. And another scene where Nina transforms into a black swan with her neck expanding and her legs breaking and black feathers piercing through her skin.As for the finale I never seen anything as vile in my entire life and for this to win 57 awards and an Oscar,they could have given it to some other film.AVOID",1,7,13,13 March 2014
Walk the Line," One of the best biopics I have seen in a long time
","I usually don't go for true-life stories but I had to watch this because I like Reese Witherspoon and I like musical movies.Walk The Line is an Oscar winning biopic based on the country singer Johnny Cash who is famous for wearing black and his battle with drugs. The film centres on J.R Cash as a child who's father used to bully him over the death of his brother John Cash who died as he got caught in a saw when he was doing work. A few years later we see a grown up J.R (Joaquin Phoniex who left the movie business behind him to focus on rapping but fear not it was a hoax)who works in the RFA as a air pilot. While he is at work he writes a song called I hang my head and cry(dunno the name of the song)and it becomes an instant hit.He goes to a record deal in his hometown and his first single was the song he sang at the RFA. He later meets June Carter(played by the brilliant Reese Witherspoon who got an award for this movie)whom he falls for as she had 2 failed marriages one was with a stock car driver the other was a lorry driver.Of course John is married with 3 young girls from Vivenne who was a right pain as she was always moaning and sulking and he hadn't a life with her at all,whereas when he is with June she helps him become a better man as he is addicted to drugs and with her help he soon stops taking them.What I like about this film is that I like how it centres on Johnny Cash's life and on his childhood and the chemistry between Phoniex & Witherspoon was very good I could watch them together in a different movie if they ever got the chance to work with each other again. Reese was fantastic as the feisty southern bell June Carter who looked unrecognizable without her blonde hair. Joaquin was brilliant as Johnny Cash even though he looked a lot like Elvis Presley in a way.I love the part where Johnny proposes to June on stage and at first she said no and then she said OK and he lifts her up in the air and says she finally said yes as they were kissing. My only downside to this film is that it was kinda hard to follow in some parts and the ending wasn't what I expected as I thought we could see Johnny & June as an old couple before they died and they were raising their children.Having said that I truly liked it and if you are a Johnny Cash fan or a Reese Witherspoon fan then check it out cause it is very good.",9,1,1,11 October 2010
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Actually better than the other 3
","Twilight Breaking Dawn is broken up into two parts. Part 1 came out in 2011 and it follows Bella and Edward getting married. While on their honeymoon,Bella finds out she's pregnant which results on her pregnancy to go at a higher speed than normal and may result in her death.Will she finally become a vampire?
Overall this was a decent film,Kirsten has improved since then and this time the director is no other than Bill Condon who directed the 2017 remake of Beauty and the beast.

The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Surprised by this film.
","The Perks of Being A Wallflower is a 2012 Romantic Drama/Indie film starring Logan Lerman,Erza Miller and Emma Watson and tells the tale about an introvert named Charlie(played by Logan Lerman) who goes to high school and is constantly being bullied non stop as he has no friends ,girlfriend nothing until one day he met a guy called Patrick(Ezra Miller) and a free spirited woman named Sam(Emma Watson sporting an American accent) who happens to be Patrick's sister and eventually the 3 of them become best mates till Charlie starts to fall for Sam who like Charlie is hiding a painful secret too as like Charlie she was abused by her own uncle sexually along with Charlie who was also abused as a kid. Overall I enjoyed this film sure I had Emma Watson in my head as Hermoine Granger and Belle but she was good as Sam,the plot is quite dark and deals with some serious issues such as mental illnesses,bullying,sexual harassments,suicide, coming out etc. Also stars Paul Rudd,Kate Walsh, Mae Whitman and a cameo with Joan Cussack I give it a B-",8,2,3,3 January 2018
The Finest Hours," If you loved Titanic or The Day After Tomorrow then this is for you
","Yesterday myself,my mom and my younger brother all went to see The Finest Hours yesterday. Surprisingly there was no one in the cinema only us 3 so that made it even more great. The film is based on a true story about a ship that got stranded in a stormy night and its up to Bernie(played by Chris Pine)to save the 32 oil tankers who are lost at sea on a ship. The story of course opens with Bernie(Pine) meeting his love(played by Holiday Granger from the 2015 Disney movie Cinderella)and Bernie works for a man called Daniel Gluff played by Eric Bana(the original Hulk) and he discovers that his friend played by Casey Affleck is stranded on a ship along with his working buddies. So Bernie and his co brace the stormy weather to save his friend and his working buddies. Now I know what you are thinking, haven't we all seen this film before,and your right you did see this film before as the film reminded me an awful lot like Titanic. As we see the boat sinking and I said to myself this film is sorta ripping off the Titanic even though this film The Finest Hours is set in 1952 America not 1916 in Liverpool where the Titanic first left.The effects in this film were brilliant as I loved seeing the special effects on the ship as like in Titanic it was so real looking. The rest of the actors were very good and for a Disney movie it didn't feel like a Disney movie at all it felt more like a 20th Century Fox film.But having said that I really enjoyed this film and I was glad to have seen it,as a friend of mine recommended me to see it. My rating out of 107/10Out of 5 I would say 4/5.",7,2,7,29 February 2016
The Sound of Music," One of if not the best musical of all time starring the one and only Ms Julie Andrews
","The Sound Of Music. Everyone knows this movie/musical by now. You all know the songs,the story everything so why is this movie so popular,well for me its gotta be the songs as they as so memorable and entertaining.I happened to have watched this last night after a very long tie and let me tell ya I loved it. The Story is about a would be nun named Maria who is living in a convent with nuns(played by Julie Andrews) who becomes a governess,as the nuns wanted her to mind the Von Trapp family(led by Christopher Plummer who plays Captian Gaynor Von Trapp,who is a widowed father of 7 children). At first the Von Trapp children aren't too keen on Maria but once she teaches them how to sing and enjoy life they start to like her more including Captian Von Trapp himself. Of course the Capitan has to leave to Vienna (since the film is set in Austria)and Maria has to look after his children,but when the Capitan comes back he announces his engagement to the baroness(who in my opinion is a gold-digger). But when the Capitan later falls for Maria,things get complicated. So will the Captian change his mind on marrying the baroness and marry Maria instead and avoid the Nazzi's who are after the Von Trapp's.Bottom line I highly recommend this gem to everyone who loves musical's and let me say that this is way better than Into The Woods hands down. Also my favorite songs include The Sound Of Music,Do Ra Me,You are 16 going on 17,and that love ballad Maria and the Captian sing when they kiss for the first time as well as Climb Every Mountain.If you ever seen Vin Diesel's film The Pacifier they actually reference this movie which I thought was cool.Overall they just don't make movies like these anymore and if there was ever a remake of this movie to come out down the line I would love Lily James and Richard Madden to play Maria and Captian Von Trapp. I dunno why but I seen these guys in Cinderella and parts of the movie reminded me of that film. Also may I just add before I finish this review that Christopher Plummer was very handsome in this film.Thumbs up for The Sound Of Music.'The hills are alive,with the sound of music'.10/10 A+Lady Gaga also did a melody of this at the Oscars this year to celebrate the movie for being 50 years old(yes ladies and gentlemen this movie marked 50 years this year as the film came out in March 1965).",10,2,8,3 June 2015
50 First Dates," Actually not a bad film which teams up Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler again
","Contains spoilers50 First Dates is a 2004 film starring Adam Sandler as Henry a playboy vet who one day meets and falls for a quirky young woman named Lucy played by Drew Barrymore. But what Henry doesn't know is that Lucy can't remember anything at all as she was involved in a car crash a few years ago with her dad. Despite all this can Henry make Lucy fall in love with him all over again?.Also featuring Rob Schnieder as a blind man and Sean Austin this film is actually pretty good. The ending was satisfying as Henry marries Lucy and their expecting a baby and he records videos for Lucy so that she won't forget about Henry everyday.Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore again reunite after The Wedding Singer and again after 50 First Dates they starred in the 2014 film Blended.
If you are looking for a funny film that pokes fun at amenisa then watch this, If not then watch the 2013 of the tv movie Remember Sunday which stars Zachary Levi as a man who suffers a memory loss.

Ghost," For a movie that's 30 years old it still holds up
","Mild spoilersGhost stars the late Patrick Swayze,Demi Moore and Tony Goldwyn alongside Whoopi Goldberg and tells the story of a young couple named Molly and Sam who move into an apartment in NYC. Problems arise when Sam gets murdered by a robber and Sam now a ghost is helping his heartbroken girlfriend from danger. He teams up with a fortune teller played by Whoopi Goldberg to find out who wanted him dead and why? Could it be Sam's co worker and friend Carl(Goldwyn) behind Sam's death?.Overall it was a well done movie. The special effects are good,the music is both haunting and sweet. The acting was good too. Patrick and Demi had great chemistry and Tony Goldwyn as the villian was a real surprise as he was up to no good with money.If you love ghost movies then check it out.",7,2,2,23 January 2020
Deepwater Horizon," If you loved The Finest Hours then check this out
","Deepwater Horizon is a 2016 action thriller drama based on the worst oil explosion in history that occurred on the 20th of April 2010. Mark Wahlberg plays Mike Williams an oil ringer who departs to the deepwater horizon along with Jimmy played by Kurt Russell and Co as Mike leaves his wife played by Kate Hudson and daughter for three weeks to uncover the oil rig. Mike and the gang want John Malcovich's charcther to test the oil and he refuses at first. From there we see the ship go up on fire injuring and most likely Killing everyone. But will Mike survive? Overall this film was a real thrill ride once we see the explosion take place. The acting was top notch, the effects were brilliant, and i was glad that i got to see it in the cinema. Thumbs up.",10,2,5,9 October 2016
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Great movie from Robert Zemeckis
","Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a 1988 live action/animated film starring Bob Hopkins and Christopher Lloyd and tells the story of a private detective who's wife was killed by a toon and has another case where he helps an animated rabbit named Roger who was framed. So who could be the person to set him up?
The story is good,the effects are great and Christopher Lloyd as Judge Doom is like the scariest villian ever(dont start on me about the reveal that his a cartoon in disguise that creeped me out). Also Roger's love interest Jessica Rabbit(Kathleen Turner) is the most attractive woman I have ever seen(in the 2010s we had Flynn Rider from Tangled).",8,1,1,7 March 2020
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," One of the most hilarious animal movies I have seen from the old school of Disney
","101 Dalmations (the animated one NOT the 1996 version with Glen Close)was Disney's 17th Animated Classic and tells the tale of two people who meet in a park by Roger's dog who fell in love with Anita's dog and the two owners get married. Later Pongo's female companion has babies but when Anita's former mate Cruella De Vil wants them for herself she refuses and Cruella hires two dimwitted men to steal them while Anita and Roger aren't there.From here on it there's laughter in almost every scene. From that wide- eyed cat who helps them escape,to the part where Cruella looks rather wacky looking(if you watch it near the end there's a scene that will scare the crap out of yeah)and the dimwitted robbers getting kicked by a horse was hilarious.The animation is really good yet not as good as lets say Aladdin as its done in pencil drawing and you can clearly see the circles on the charcther design. Also Anita and Roger remind me of the new characters from the upcoming movie Frozen but still is 101 Dalmatians my all time favourite NO but was it good YES.Im giving it a 9 out of 10.",9,5,5,5 September 2013
Rocketman," Actually better than Bohemian Rhapsody
","Rocketman is a biography movie based off English Singer/Songwriter Elton John played in the film by Taron Egerton from Eddie The Eagle and tells the story of Reginald Wright(aka Elton John) who lived a hard life. His father didn't care about him,his mother didn't care about him either but she wasn't as bad as Reginald's father. We also get to see Elton falling downhill with drink,drugs and even suicide attempts along with his sexuality.What I really liked about this film was the visuals along with Taron's singing and acting chops. For a man who had to play a UK skier in Eddie The Eagle to this,I really hope he wins or gets an Oscar 2020 nod for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy. This film is told in flashbacks btw as we see Elton in rehab.
Also stars Richard Madden as John Reid who had an affair with Elton John,an unreconisable Bryce Dallas Howard as Elton's mother,Jamie Bell as Bernie who Elton works with organising songs as well as fancing him and even Hercules himself Tate Donovan stars as a club manager in the states.Keep an eye out for Keith Lemon from Celebirty Juice.

A Star Is Born," Best film of 2018 believe the hype(spoilers ahead)
","A Star Is Born is the latest film to be remade and stars Bradley Cooper(who directs this movie and wrote it) and Lady Gaga and tells the story about this troubled musician named Jackson Maine who falls in love with an inspiring singer/songwriter named Ally who he meets at a gay bar. As he is helping Ally with her stardom will her career ruin their own relationship as a man wants to take her away from Jackson and become an International pop star?Lady Gaga totally knocked it out of the park as Ally and her chemistry with Bradley was brilliant;as it reminded me of Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoniex's chemistry in the 2005 biopic Walk The Line. Bradley Cooper was brilliant in this movie as the Alcoholic/Drug Addict Jackson Maine and his directing was brilliant also. For his singing voice oh boy can he sing so good as well as play the guitar. If he doesn't win an award for this film I will be upset,same goes to Lady Gaga.
The last 10 minutes of this film had both me and my mum in tears as Spoiler alert(Jackson commits suicide in the end by hanging himself in the garage) and the last song I'll Never Love Again was such a heartbreaking/beautiful ballad sung by Gaga on stage.
For 2 hours and 20 minutes this film is such an emotional rollercoaster ride I'm still crying over it. For someone who wasn't a fan of Lady Gaga she won me over in this movieMy advice believe the hype and enjoy this brilliant Oscar Worthy flick.10/10Bring home the Oscars and the Golden Globes Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper i 2019.",10,1,6,7 October 2018
Mulan," Brilliant movie from Disney
",I got this as a present back in 1998 and I'm glad I own it on VHS.The film is about a young maiden who disguises herself as a man in order to save her people in China as her father is unable to fight in the war. Along the way she meets a hilarious dragon(who looks more like a lizard than a dragon)voiced by Eddie Murphy and falls for a handsome captian named Shang.The story isn't your typical fairytale movie as its all about action and adventure. Seriously I have no idea why Mulan is a princess as she isn't royal at all. The whole film was edgy and excellent. The animation is very exquisite and the music is very good. The actress that voices Mulan is very good and this would have sucked big time if it weren't for funny man Eddie Murphy who saved this movie for me. I must have seen it a billion times on VHS and I enjoyed it.,8,0,0,30 January 2011

From there she meets Yon Jung played by Jude Law and she has to save mankind from shapeshifting creatures called Kruns. But when Carol discovers more about herself who can she trust?The special effects are very well done and I liked the 90s references.

Shakespeare in Love," Actually fairly good if your into William Shakespeare
","Shakespeare in Love is a 1998 Oscar winning movie starring Joseph Fiennes,Gywentth Paltrow,Rupert Everett and Ben Affleck and tells the story of a young playwright named William Shakespeare(Fiennes)who is a struggling playwright who falls in love with a young woman named Viola(Paltrow)who he met while she was disguised as a man for his play and the two begin a love affair. But Viola's betrothed(Colin Firth) isn't happy about this and both Will and Viola has to keep their affair secret.Will they get caught out?Overall the costume designs are great,the story is easy to follow and the script is very Shakespearean.Parts of this film is like something Baz Luhreman would direct or even Kenneth Branagh as its a very periodic film. This film also stars Imelda Staunton,Tom Carter and Dame Judi Dench.Overall im giving this a B-. Not one of my favorites but its a good film nonetheless.",6,0,0,5 September 2019
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Not a bad flick starring Frozen's Kristen Bell and The Muppets Jason Segal
","Jason Segal plays Peter a film composer who seems like he found the right girl called Sarah Marshall(Kristen Bell). But when she calls in to see him in the nude she of course wants to break up with him. Heartbroken he decides to go on a vacation to clear his head,ONLY for him to meet her again,only this time she has a new man in her life (played by Russell Brand).Later Peter meets a quirky receptionist called Rachel(played by Oz The Great & Powerful's Mina Kunis) and the two become close friends. But will Peter ever let go of Sarah and settle down with Rachel instead?Overall this screwball comedy has a few laughs in it,there's a lot of nudity however so be prepared but hey I remember seeing it before and it wasn't a bad film. If you love your movies where the guy just can't seem to let go of a chick or if you love Jason Segal and any actor that was involved in this film then check it out. Overall im giving it a 6.Keep an eye out for Paul Rudd from This Is 40 and Jonah Hill who later teamed up with Russell Brand in Get Him To Greek which is a spin off of Forgetting Sarah Marshall.",6,0,2,2 February 2014
Zootopia," A really good film from Walt Disney Animation Studios to come out in 2016 so far
","I will try not to give away too much about this film so on to the review. Zootopia or Zootropolis(as its known here in Ireland)is directed by Byron Howard(who directed my all time favourite Disney movie Tangled)and Rich Moore(who directed Wreck It Ralph)and tells the tale of a young rabbit named Judy Hopps(Ginnfer Goodwin)who dreams of being a cop. But as a kid she got bullied for saving a rabbit's life by a fox who told her she was never going to make it as a cop. Fast forward a few years later and Judy decides to leave her hometown and go to Zootropolis(hence the title of the film). From there she moves into an apartment and does some training at the police force so that she can make it big at the police force. Judy later teams up with a sly fox named Nick Wilde(Jason Bateman)and of course she wants him to help her track down a case as an otter is gone missing and since he is a suspect (since he was the last one to see the otter)its up to the two to track down the otter. But with some strange behaviour going on with the animals? could there be a culprit that is turning all the animals against each other???Bottom line you guys I went to see this yesterday in 3D with my family and to be honest I really really enjoyed this movie. The charcthers are well structured,the animation is very well done,the 3D part though to be fair wasn't that great I preferred the 3D in Kung Fu Panda to be honest as Zootopia hadn't much 3D AT ALL in the screening I went to see yesterday.The story is very done and I thought it was very clever that they used bullying,drugs,racism, stereotypes etc all in the stories scenario. My favourite charcthers have to be Judy and Nick as both of them have the same problems since they were kids(as they were told they weren't good enough to be whatever they wanted to be....you just have to watch the film to get what I am talking about).Shakira makes a cameo too as a famous pop star called Gazelle and she sings the main theme for the film Try Everything(which is litreally stuck in my head since I seen this movie yesterday).If you loved 21 Jump Street,The Godfather,Speed,or any animated films or just a fan of Disney in general than check it out.Best Part: Nick conning the elephant at the ice cream parlour with a tiny animal done up as a baby who is actually not a baby animal at all as he has a grown up voice or the part where the sloths were very slow at the desk. Animation is gorgeous and everything about it was good. Even the villain reveal in the end.The Godfather part cracked me up so hard.Worst Bit; Not worth seeing it in 3D as there isn't much in 3D at all like I have mentioned before.9.5/10 A- 4.5/5Worth watching,excellentPs Keep an ear open for Kirsten Bell who has a one liner as a female sloth called Priscella and Alan Tuduk as the voice of duke of weasleton who is over the pirate DVDS.",9,5,14,21 March 2016
Beauty and the Beast," One of the best Disney movies ever made
","I bought this yesterday as an early Christmas present and I decided to watch it last night as it was a long time ago since I last seen it. Here is my say on this movie.Well what can I say about this film.Well here is two words to describe it absolutely brilliant. The beginning of the movie is the song 'Belle' which focuses on Belle who is a daydreaming,oddball maid who lives in 17th century France. She goes on about handsome princes in disguise and wanting a provincial life. A man named Gaston wants to marry her but she doesn't want to be with him as she describes him as being conceited and very rude. Before this song we see how the prince became a beast as he didn't like the enchantress's ugly form(as she disguised herself as an old beggar woman)but when he turned his back on her over her ugliness she transformed him into a ferlious beast and those who were in the castle were transformed into enchanted objects.Back to Belle her father is an inventor and he goes off to the fair leaving Belle to be by herself as she is an only child. As her father goes to the fair,he gets lost and enters a spooky castle where the Beast lives along with his servants Cogsworth & Lumiere.The Beast of course doesn't like the idea that Maurice(Belle's father) entered his castle and so he locks him up in the dungeon. Belle meanwhile is still being pushed around by Gaston(who is the villain in this film) and he keeps asking her to marry him and they'll have little boys like himself.As Belle gets worried about her father as he never returned she goes to the castle with her horse Philippe(who came back for her) and as she enters the castle she goes to the dungeon and sees her father.Of course the beast is there and she decides to take her father's place. Scared that she will never see her father again she finds herself becoming more close with the Beast who starts off as a stubborn,bad-tempered monster and later in the movie we see a whole new side to him. But what Belle doesn't know is that he is a handsome prince in monstrous form and in order for him to become human again,Belle must love him and as the rose's(which the enchantress gave him in the beginning of the film)last petal falls then the spell will be broken if he doesn't learn how to love someone then it won't wear off.Enough said about that as I might give away too much information but here is what I liked about this film;1)Accepting a person for who they are on the outside and not on the inside.2)The ballroom scene in this was brilliant
3)The chemistry between Belle & the Beast was beautiful I could have cried for days as I see how their romance blossoms.4)The music is brilliant from the opening song Belle to Be our guest,to Gaston to Beauty & the Beast I adored the score to this film.5) The villain was brilliant as he was cocky and vain as well as self centered.Beauty & the Beast is my 5th all time favourite film as its so romantic,entertaining if not dark in some places but having said that it is a very good film. I like Belle as she isn't irritating like most Disney princesses(aka Ariel&Snow White)and she is my 3rd favourite princess.If you never saw this film then I highly recommend it as it the best Disney movie I have seen since Enchanted which poked fun of this film in a nice way back in 2007.Verdict: A brilliant movie with a brilliant message to everyone who thinks that they aren't beautiful even though they are.9.5/10",9,0,2,2 November 2010
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," From the writer that brought you Tangled and Bolt and the composer that did music for Frozen comes this bland somewhat OK movie
","Crazy Stupid Love was on TV last night and since it starred Steve Carrell(who I think is a somewhat good actor,I liked him in Bruce Almighty,he was hilarious in The 40 Year Old Virgin and he was excellent as Gru in Despicable Me franchise). The movie is about a middle-aged man(Carrell)who's wife wants a divorce from him and so he tries to woo her again. So he hires this playboy ladies man (played by Ryan Gosling,who I may add is hot in this without his shirt)and so Gosling's charcther dresses Carrell up and tries to help him woo with the women. He does however go on a date with Marisa Tomei's charcther who happens to teach his son at school and problems arise however where Gosling falls for Emma Stone's charcther(who is later revealed as Carrell's daughter)and some babysitter is in love with Carrell and Carrell's son loves the babysitter that loves Carrell,basically its all a tangled up messy relationship that these charcthers develop from the movie.The comedy is slightly dry and its not as funny as lets say Dumb & Dumber or Rat Race for that matter,but if you are a fan of any of the actors in this movie than check it out. Once is enough to watch it or if you forgot what it was about you can check it out again.4/10",4,0,1,24 April 2014
The Notebook," Based off a Novel on the same name The Notebook is one of my new favourite movies to watch
","The Notebook is based off a Nicholas Sparks novel(so technically this is going to be a tearjearker as some of his novels got turned into movies like A Walk To Remember which is my favourite live action movie of all time,Dear John with Channing Tatum as a US Marine and its quite similar to another movie called The Lucky One with Zac Efron as a marine,and The Last Song with Miley Cyrus and her real life boyfriend/fiancé Liam Hemsworth).The story of The Notebook is about an elderly couple both played tremendously well by James Garner(no his no relation to Jennifer Garner I thought he was one stage but his not)and Gena Rowlands who live in a Nursing Home together as Rowlands'charcther has Dementia,and Garner's charcther has heart problems and he won't leave his wife's side as they are so loyal together. So every day he reads her a story about this young couple called Noah and Allie(both played by Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams) who are sorta like Romeo and Juliet. They fall in love at first sight when Noah met her at a carnival and wanted Allie to go out on a date with him and she wouldn't but she then accepted,Allie's parents are stuck up millionaires who thinks Noah is trash and not perfect for their daughter(especially her mother who is a real pain in the butt),and of course both Allie and Noah break up for a while only for faith to bring them back together again.Problem is however Allie is engaged to some pilot played by an unrecognizable James Marsden(from Enchanted and 27 Dresses)who was injured when he met Allie working at the Hospital where she is qualified as a nurse and Noah is heartbroken.But what does there story have in common with James and Gene's charcthers????WARNING THIS IS A SPOILER DO NOT READ ON ANY FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT THIS TO GET RUINED.Its actually THEM that he is talking about to his wife as they are Noah and Allie in their old stages of life.Bottom line: When I first saw this on TV I thought I wasn't going to like it so when I got this for a bargain in Golden Discs for 6 Euro,I had to get my hands in it because I'm a sucker for a good romantic drama and my favourite romantic drama of all time has to be(actually I have two; Titanic and A Walk To Remember because they both got incredible stories and the cast was brilliant in both films).Here its the same: The cast was brilliant especially James Garner,Gene Rowlands,Rachel McAdams,and Ryan Gosling,the story was so beautifully well told,even the setting was great as its set in 1940s America during the War. The music was depressing as hell,but hey it has to have depressing music since after all this is a tearjearker(so you have been warned,if you are up for a great love story since Titanic then look no further with this film).Overall: The Notebook is a heartbreaking love story about a low class boy and a high up girl who are thrown together by chance and fall in love with each other.Bottom line I have nothing bad to say about it other than the depressing music but for that its a 10/10",10,0,2,4 August 2013
Ted," A silly entertaining comedy
",Ted is a 2012 Fantasy Comedy starring Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis and is directed by Seth McFarlaine who provides the voice of the title charcther and tells the story of a grown up man who wished that his teddy bear would come to life when he was a kid. The wish comes true and a few years later the teddy would grow up to be a foul-mouthed weed user while John(Wahlberg)is in a relationship with his girlfriend played by Mila Kunis.Overall this was a silly film yet I enjoyed it as I never seen it before so when I spot it on Netflix I decided to watch it as another film I was going to watch wouldn't work properly so I opted for this film instead. Glad I seen it.7/10,7,0,0,1 March 2019
Spider-Man 2," Im a 22 year old woman and I loved Spiderman
","Hey what can I expect his a cool guy who can kick butt and save the day. So alright what is Spiderman 2 about well its a sequel to the 2002 hit and it tells the tale of Peter who is still in love with Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst),the problem is whoever she is seeing someone else and forgetting about Peter Parker from the 1st movie as he didn't feel the same way about her.Meanwhile Peter's best friend Harry Osborn(James Franco) is seeking revenge from the death of his father who was killed in Spiderman 1 and since then he wants to get his hands on Peter Parker.But wait you may ask who the villain is? Well the villain in this film is Dr Ocatavius(Alfred Molina)who is coming up with a new project that goes horribly wrong and it tragically kills his wife(Donna Murphy who yes folks is Mother Gothel from Tangled hilarious). So its up to Peter/Spiderman to save the town of NYC against the new nemesis. So what do I think of it?I actually enjoyed this movie as it had some terrific special effects,and the story as great along with the charcthers.The setting was excellent I swear if they re-release this in 3D i'd say it would make the film 10 times better than in Non 3D format. My only complaint however is Mary Jane Watson aka Kirsten Dunst. She is a great actress don't get me wrong but here she's always whining,always moaning and she just WON'T make up her BLOODY mind as to whether or not she loves Peter or not.But she gets worse in Spiderman 3.Overall im giving it an 8/10",8,4,6,23 May 2013
Finding Nemo," A breathtaking adventure that you can watch again and again
","Finding Nemo is a Pixar animated movie about a clown fish named Merlin who is an overprotective parent to Nemo,as his wife died and Merlin found Nemo's egg and from that day Merlin is afraid to let go of his son. A few years later Nemo is all grown up(kind of) and goes to school,but when he got mad at his father who wouldn't leave him alone,Nemo gets taken by a scuba diver and is taken to Sydney Australia(where the movie is set) and is now living at the aquarium at the dentist clinic,where the dentist's daughter wants Nemo!!!.So Nemo tries to find a way out thanks to some fish(one led by Spiderman star Willem Defoe,and Brad Garrett who was the voice of Hook Hand Thug in Tangled),while Nemo's dad travels all over the sea to search for his son,alongside a forgetful fish named Dory(voiced by Ellen De Generes)who helps him find his son again. They later meet a bunch of tortoises who help Nemos dad find Nemo again. But will Merlin ever see his son alive ever again,and can Nemo escape the aquarium at the dentist clinic to be reunited with his father?Bottom line I have seen this movie before and to be quite honest I really enjoyed this movie. The animation is fantastic,the story is very touching and will lift your spirits,the voice cast is great,especially the guy who voices Merlin(who I think starred in The In Laws with Micheal Douglas,Albert Finney yeah him)and as for the rest of the film well its actually really good. My favourite Pixar movie would have to be Toy Story but this would probably in my list too somewhere.Overall its a thrill to watch and I recommend it to those who love underwater adventure movies. I have nothing wrong to say about it so i'll give it a 9 out 10.Cowabunga dude",9,1,2,16 April 2014
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," I thought it wasn't bad for a X-Men spin off but i do prefer the original X-Men movies
","The film opens with Wolverine(real name James Logan)with his brother and we see that their father gets killed. But he is shocked that the man who killed his so called father wasn't his biological father at all it was the man who killed his so called father was his own real father. We then cut to see James and his brother grow up and battle in wars and everything(both played by Hugh Jackman and Liev Schrieber and the film progresses along. Later we see that James and his brother have a heated argument as he James abandon's his brother for Project X. Meanwhile we get to find out that he lives a normal life now and has a girlfriend(played by Lynn Collins from 13 Going On 30)and all is good for him,except for one day James' brother strikes revenge and kills James's girlfriend and he of course gets revenge. James then meets up with a man who gives him the Project X and it is here where James' ditches his name and calls himself Wolverine(as his girlfriend gave him this nickname)and he goes into this tank of water that gives him his powers of healing and his claws and he later escapes and meets his brother Sabbatooth(played by Liev Schrieber who worked with Hugh Jackman in the 2001 romantic fantasy comedy Kate & Leopold) and Deadpool(played by Ryan Reynolds who shows up in the beginning of the film but he doesn't show up till the very end of the movie). But when Logan meets a famous face from his past once he find out what the man that gave him the project X is at he gets the shock of his life. Could it be Logan's girlfriend who got killed by Sabbatooth?.Also starring US singer Will.I.AM,this film reminds me of Superman's backstory as we see Wolverine escaping the place where he got his powers from and hides out in this farmer house where he meets a farmer and his wife and he stays with them for a while. The part I thought was cool was when Wolverine and Sabbatooth were battling Deadpool and he vanishes here and there.Plus Wolverine's power are cool too. Hugh Jackman without a doubt is one if not the finest Australian actor in Hollywood. His well known as Wolverine and for starring in a lot of action films and less romantic films(I think he should star in more romantic films down the line,but I suppose his too old for romantic comedies I dunno). As for the rest they were all decent but you can't beat Jackman who steals the whole film. The effects were good too,like one where his on a motorbike and this big explosion comes out of nowhere,it was really good.Overall I enjoyed it mostly for the effects and Hugh Jackman. But the problem is that it doesn't give you a great depth to Wolverine as a charcther. I kept questioning to myself the whole time how did he get the bone claws that turned to metal claws?,why did his biological dad killed his adopted dad. There was a lot of plot holes that needed to be resolved. But having said that I liked it mostly for Jackman and the effects.",5,0,3,9 July 2015
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Funny romantic comedy
","How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days is a 2002 romantic comedy about a young woman named Andie Anderson(Kate Hudson) who works as an editor for Cosmopolitan. One of her best friends played by Kathryn Hahn had just broken up with her boyfriend due to her unclingness. So Andie decides to write an article dubbed How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days where she acts all clingy and needy so that the guy would break up with her. We later meet a womanizing journalist named Benjamin Barry played by Matthew McConnaghey who also makes a bet where he can make any woman fall in love with him in 10 Days. However when Ben meets Andie the two start blackmailing each other little do they know that one is lying to the other. But can Andie end up falling for Ben for real?
Overall I haven't seen this film in years and I got it on DVD last month and watched it last night. Kate Hudson is just like her famous mother Goldie Hawn as they both have the same sarcastic dry humour which makes Hudson likeable. Matthew McConaghet used to be the king of romantic comedies before he ditched them for good in 2009 with Ghost Of Girlfriend Past and also would team up with Kate Hudson in the 2008 flick Fools Gold. Here in How to lose a guy in 10 Days he was charismatic and just dreamy.The chemistry between Hudson and McConnaghey was very good and the plot of the film was great.

Rise of the Guardians," Rise of The Guardians is a great animated film for the whole family to see
","I seen this in the cinemas 3 years ago with my cousin and I thoroughly enjoyed it.I happened to be watching it last night on TV as it was on so on to the review.Rise Of The Guardians is a Dreamworks Animation movie that tells the tale of Jack Frost(voiced by Into The Woods star Chris Pine)who isn't believed in with the kids as they don't know him as much as the other guardians. One day however and he happens to be chosen by the guardians and he teams up with Santa Clause(voiced by Alec Baldwin with a Russian Accent who is from 30 Rock),Tooth Fairy(voiced by The Great Gatsby's Isla Fisher),the Sandman who doesn't talk,and an Aussie Easter Bunny(voiced by X-Men star and Aussie Actor Hugh Jackman). Together they try and defeat the evil bogeyman named Pitch Black(voiced by The Holiday's Jude Law) who like Jack isn't believed in either and wants the rest of the guardians to suffer just like him. So can the guardians make the kids believe in them and stop Pitch Black from ruining the children's dreams and imaginations forever?Bottom line I enjoyed it the first time I watched it and again last night after 3 years watching it last. The story was very well done,the voice acting is great(it was nice to hear Hugh Jackman use his own accent and not to be putting on another accent as he doesn't use his own accent that much in his films)but the real surprise was Alec Baldwin as Santa Clause with a Russian accent. He really nailed it as his charcther in the movie. Chris Pine sounded very old for Jack Frost but he did a good job since this was his first animated debut.If you love animation like me and want a feel-good movie to watch then check it out.

Orphan," Actually enjoyed it
","Orphan is a 2009 thriller starring Vera Flamiga and Peter Skarsgard. The story is about a doting couple who have 2 children and are mourning the death of their stillborn daughter. They decide to adopt another child at an orphanage and settle for a 9 year old called Esther who originally came from Russia. But when bad things start happening could it be the sweet and innocent 9 year old that's behind it.The acting is good,the movie is very suspense and I'm impressed with the actress Isabella who plays Esther the 9 year old who's not really that age at all(she's really a 33 year old psychopath who was born with dwarfism and uses her condition to disguise herself as a kid). If you like movies based on real life events(as there was a case similar to this with a Russian girl called Nataile who disguised herself as a kid and framed her adopted parents who ended up in jail).Check it outI",7,0,0,27 October 2019
Home Alone," Home Alone is a touching hilarious comedy suitable for this holiday season
","I loved this movie since god knows when so I was lucky to buy this as a double bill with this one and its sequel Home Alone 2 but back to this movie.Macaulay Culkin (what a cutie he was when he was 10 here now his the same age as Zachary Levi from Tangled 33 YEARS OLD)plays Kevin a young boy who's family goes off on holidays and accidentally leaves Kevin home alone as Kevin wished his parents to go away for good,leaving his family to forget all about him. He soon realizes that family is all his got and as he is enjoying some time by himself,two robbers played by Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci are up to no good in the neighborhood and discover that Kevin is home alone little do they know that Kevin means business and causes havoc with the two robbers.But will Kevin's parents remember that Kevin is absent on the airplane and will his mother come back all the way from Paris to be with her son??Overall this movie has some hilarious moments,between the famous scream impression Kevin does as he accidentally puts aftershave on his face leaving him screaming when he puts it on his face,the iron falling onto the robbers face(Stern), and the other robber's head(Pesci) goes up on fire. Along with this it has a very touching finale that will leave you sorta teary eyed( I saw it last night on DVD and I swear I got all teary -eyed in the end).Overall this gets a solid 10.",10,0,1,1 December 2013
About Time," I just couldn't buy into it at all
","I happened to have seen this last night on TV since I never seen it before and decided to check it out. Now this is a time travelling movie so time travel in movies can be sort of a hit and a miss. The likes of Back To The Future,The Terminator,even Kate & Leopold all use some sort of time travelling device in their films and sometimes it can be a little bit far-fetched.In this film Domhnall Gleason(son of Brendan Gleason)plays Tim a young man in his early 20s who has a family secret. His father,great grandfather and granddad can all travel in time past,present or future. So Tim decides to use it to his advantage by going into a dark room,closing his eyes and his fists tight and then he ends up going into another time frame. Things turn unexpectedly for the young lad as he ends up falling for an American named Mary(Rachel McAdams) who doesn't know that he can time travel. So will something bad happen once he goes in and out of time?Bottom line I honestly thought this film was rather dull to be honest with you. The time travelling made zero sense to me as all Tim did was close his eyes and his fists tightly goes into dark room and bang his gone to another time frame.If you like time travelling movies than check it out if not than avoid.",3,0,3,7 April 2016
Spotlight," A pretty solid film that took home an Oscar this year.
","Spotlight is directed by Tom McCarthney and stars Mark Ruffalo from 13 Going On 30 and Avengers,Rachel McAdams from The Vow,Micheal Keaton from Birdman and Jack Frost,Liev Schreiber from Kate & Leopold,and Stanley Tucci from Maid In Manhattan and tells the tale about a group of journalists who work for a man played by Keaton who uncovers the shocking truth behind the catholic church as a bunch of priests were assaulting innocent people sexually and verbally and The Boston Globe team has to find the innocent people and write an article for this shocking scandal that shook the world.Now I had no intention of seeing this movie as I got the DVD of it a few days ago as I heard that it was a very good movie that won Best Picture at the Oscars this year. Th film feels more like a documentary rather than a film as the whole film consists of Ruffalo,McAdams,Schreiber,and Keaton trying to come up with an article for the Catholic Church and to find as many pedo priests as possible resulting in a shocking amount of priests who have ruined the lives of many people. What I liked about this film was the cast now I always liked Micheal Keaton,Rachel McAdams and Mark Ruffalo as I seen them in A lot of films,Liev Schreiber I only seen him in X Men Orgins Wolverine and Kate & Leopold and I thought Schreiber was hilarious in Kate & Leopold.My only downside to this film is that it feels like it drags on and on and I was surprised there wasn't any scenes where we actually see the priests doing the shocking things that they did to the people many years ago as this film is set in the year 2001 since the scandal occurred,and for a whooping 123 minutes it certainly drags A lot. But sure I thought it was a pretty good flick,did it deserve to in Best Picture? Well it is a good movie but im sure there were plenty of other films that surpass this one.My overall rating is a 8 and a half out of 10 and 4/5 stars.Very good film if you are into these true stories and you want to find out more on the Catholic Church scandal. I myself am a catholic person and I was shocked at the outcome of it all.",8,0,2,27 May 2016
The Jungle Book," Loved it as a kid and still do
","The original Jungle Book is about a young boy named Mowgli who is reared by wolves and befriends a tiger called Baghara who protects him from Shere Khan who is out to get him. He later meets a bear named Baloo, a jazz loving bear who becomes friends with Mowgii and together they help each other out. So will Shere Khan get Mowgli?Overall this is pretty similar to the 2016 version which was spectacular the only difference is Baloo disguises himself as a monkey whereas in the new one he doesn't. The animated one is shorter than the live action one and Kaa is voiced by the same voice actor that gave us Winnie The Pooh,whereas in the new one its Scarlett Johanson.

X-Men," X Men the movie that started it all with Superheros.
","As a kid I loved the X-Men cartoon series. Strange as it is coming from a young girl who grew up in the 90's but still though I loved watching X Men,Spiderman to name a few as a kid and to this day I still love them. So in the new Millennium 20th Century Fox gave us X-Men a movie adaptation based on the famous Marvel comic books and cartoon series. The story is as follows. A young woman named Marie(Rogue) played by Anna Paquin from True Blood is a introvert who discovers she has superhero powers as she can kill anyone if you touch her and she could absorb someone else's powers(she kinda reminds me of Elsa from Frozen but anyways)she runs away after nearly killing her boyfriend and bumps into a arrogant man named Logan(Wolverine as he is later known as)played by Aussie Star Hugh Jackman in his Hollywood debut and the movie that gained his career in showbiz. Together Logan and Rogue end up being kept captured by other mutants called Storm and Cyclops(played by Halle Berry and Enchanted's James Marsden)and they both work for Professor Charles X played by Patrick Stewart from Star Trek TV series. Logan and Rogue must fight for mankind as well as battling other mutants one who can change into anyone she wants called Mystique(played by Rebecca Romijn)and Sabbatooth(played by Tyler Mane)as both of these are working for a former friend of Professor X, Magneto played by Ian McKellan. So will Rogue,Wolverine and Co save mankind?Overall I really enjoyed this movie. Is it the best movie ever No its not and I tell you my only problem with this film were the effects,especially when Hugh Jackman as Wolverine took out his claws you can clearly tell that it was prosthetic hands as it felt kinda false to me compare to X Men Orgins: Wolverine which was better with the effects. But hey this is the year 2000 we are talking about here. Also the rest of the film seemed kinda fake like one where the Senator was also a mutant and he can change into water and he blew up in the end as well as moving like rubber,and I thought he looked very false looking too. Mystique and Wolverine are literally the coolest superheros ever in my opinion as Wolverine is rough and arrogant and Mystique(who said nothing in this film)was cool for changing into different people. As for the rest of the superheros they are all good too. The cast was all very good especially Hugh Jackman who was a newcomer in Hollywood as he hails from Austrailia and to have him change his persona and accent in every film he is in is brilliant. Not only is this guy handsome and down to earth but he is a remarkable actor and isn't one of those typecast actors who just walks in and be themselves in every godforsaken film they are in(I am looking at you Adam Sandler,Meg Ryan etc). James Marsden was also very good as Cyclops and the rest like I said were all very good. But it was a shame we couldn't get into everyone's backstory as in every X Men movie Wolverine is the star of the show in X Men. Why I may never know but I guess its got to do with his powers and that.Bottom line I liked it and I was glad to see it again after all those years and finally got the original box set of the franchise from 2000- 2006 at a very reasonable price.Now all I have to watch next time is X Men 2:United. Stick around for that review which will be the next review.C+ 7.0/103.5/5Good fun",7,1,2,21 August 2015
Spider-Man 3," The worst film of 2007
","What went bad with Spiderman 3 well let me tell ya I was so disappointed with this film.The 2nd sequel to the 2004 film of the same name is about Peter Parker & Mary Jane's relationship and Peter wants to propose to Mary Jane Watson. His best friend is seeking revenge on him and other villains like Sandman and Venom also out to get Spiderman he has to save the world again. But back to the film and a strange black substance gets onto Peter which turns him into an evil version of Spiderman that made him look like Jim Carrey in The Mask which was hilarious but this was so crap.The acting was rubbish(Kirsten Dunst was a bitch in this movie,Tobey Maguire is too childish to be Spiderman as he always cries like a 2 year old), the CGI was too fake, the music was depressing,the villains were too much one should have been enough instead of 3.And the ending was so boring.(WARNING DON'T READ: Spiderman forgives Flint who is Sandman on the death of his uncle and he turns to dust and goes off and MJ & Peter get back together.AVOID at all costs as it is a heap of crap.1/10",3,1,6,23 September 2010
Yes Man," Yes Man isn't as funny as any other Jim Carrey films I have seen in the past
","Jim Carrey is one if not my favourite comedic actor of all time. His quirky,silly,over the top and just down right insane is one word to describe him as a whole. So he decided to star in his romantic comedy debut(since all the other films he starred in were just comedies and not romantic) and it shows in this movie that his not as funny as he used to be.Here he plays a man called Carl Allen,a depressed banker(like his charcther in The Mask, Stanley Ipkiss who was also a banker)who always says no to everything.All Carl does on his night out is rent DVDs and spends some time with himself,as he suffered a marriage breakdown with a girl called Stephaine and his just laying cool. But when a friend of his invites him to go to a conference held by Terrence Stamp who persuades Carl to say Yes to everything, things starts happening like one where he meets and falls for a quirky singer songwriter named Alison(played by singer songwriter/actress Zooey Deschanel)who Carl met in a petrol station,and they spend some time together during their time together like going to a no- entry concert hall,gong to Nebraska for a weekend and of course fall for each other. But will he and Alison get together in the end well you have to see the film to know what is happening.Like I said Jim Carrey is a funnyman. His serious roles just don't suit him at all as without his over the top charm,his just a boring dull guy. And well.........it shows in this film. I enjoyed it as it was on last night and parts of it was funny but it was a bit boring as it wasn't Jim Carrey's best. Jim might as well quit acting and start something else.5/10Out of 5 stars 2.5/5C-",5,1,1,15 June 2015
The Last Song," To all the Miley Cyrus haters give her a chance she's not a bad actress
","The Last song is a 2010 Touchstone pictures film which is Miley Cyrus's first serious role since her Hannah Montana debut. The movie is about a rebellious teenager who is always getting herself into trouble and she and her brother are sent to live with their father as he and their mother broke up a couple of years ago. Ronnie(Cyrus) meets a local beach boy named Will(Chris Hemsworth brother Liam who went out with Cyrus in real life)while she is staying with her father and as she spends some time with her father she realizes that he too likes music like herself but he is hiding a painful secret to Ronnie & her brother,his got cancer and has a few months to live. I found the beginning of this film really hard to follow because we see Ronnie's father in a building and two firefighters have him by the arms as he was being rescued as the church was burnt down. The charcthers are alright I found Miley Cryus abit self-centered and bratty in this film as she is a troublemaker being sent to live with her dying father,the music was great (Maroon 5,two Miley Cyrus songs I hope you find it which was not a bad song and When I look at you which featured in the ending credits along with the other one. The chemistry between Cyrus and Hemsworth was cute kinda like a Romeo & Juilet thing going on.Be ready for the hankies as the ending to this will have you crying. Miley Cryus fans will like this film,dunno about the haters though as they will keep saying Stupid Miley,Stupid actress whatever I think she was great as the bratty teenager who's dad is dying.Verdict: A tearjearker from Ms Cyrus from Hannah Montana fame.7/10",7,2,8,24 September 2010
The Terminator," Good Action flick if you are into these kind of movies
","The Terminator is a 1984 time travelling Sci Fi starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton and is directed by James Cameron (who would go on to direct Titanic and Avatar)and tells the tale of a cyborg named T-1000(Arnold)who travels to the near future to find and kill Sarah Connors(Linda). A young man named Kyle Reese(Micheal Basin) witnesses the cyborg in his time frame and he travels back to the past in order to protect Sarah Jane. But will the terminator kill Sarah?The CGI effects are OK,especially the makeup effects on Arnold when you see him taking out his fake eye.If you love time travelling movies with robots as the main focus then you may like this film. Keep an eye out for a cameo of the late Bill Paxton who also starred in Titanic directed by James Cameron.

Dear John," Not the best Nicholas Sparks novel been turned into a movie but its still average
","Dear John is similar to that 2012 film The Lucky One with Zac Efron as both Tatum and Efron both joined the army in Afghanistan and fell in love only The Lucky One is sorta different. So back to this review.The movie stars off in the year 2001 and we see John(played by Channing Tatum) at the beach and saves this girl's bag that fell into the water. This girl is called Savannah(played by Amanda Seyfried)who is smitten with John and the two fall in love.But since John has to go back to Afghanistan again leaving her alone again as well as caring for his Autistic father (played by Richard Jenkins)can him and Savannah ever get together? Well since John is gone to the Army again she ends up marrying Tim(played by ET star Henry Thomas) who happens to have cancer and has a son that is also autistic like John's father.So what did I think of this movie,well to be honest and call me cynical but I never shed a tear at this movie in fact I found it rather complicated at times and the chemistry to its credit was great between Seyfried and Tatum. Also the story has been done in that 2012 film The Lucky One and Nichloas Sparks LOVES using the same formula every single time. The poor guy had a hard life as he lost his sister and his parents so any wonder he writes these clichéd stories that happen in almost every romantic film. Boy meets girl check,falls in love check, something bad happens in the 3rd act or 2nd act check check,some dies check,sad depressing music check.Now I loved The Notebook and A Walk To Remember in fact these two are my favourite Nichloas Sparks movies of all time in my opinion as the story was better and more believable,here its kinda boring and clichéd. And I am a lover for romantic dramas. But hey I thought it was a pretty OK film,I was glad I got it on DVD as I haven't seen it in a very long time.5.2/10Grad C-",5,0,0,4 February 2015
Moana," Just came back from watching it. Very good
","Moana is the new Disney Princess movie directed by the people that brought you Aladdin and The Little Mermaid to name a few and tells the tale of a young teenager named Moana,who lives in Polynaisa with her family where a demi god named Mauli set a curse on the land over a thousand years ago and its up to Moana to team up with him to revoke the curse that is set upon the ocean. Overall the animation was gorgeous, the voice cast was good, personally i think Dwanye Johnson who voices Mauli stoled the film as he reminded me of the genie from Aladdin as he can shape shift into anything, the girl that voiced and sung as Moana was very good since it was her movie debut. There's no villain however in this film, and yes folks this is a musical. 4/5 stars",9,2,13,3 December 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spiderman Homecoming movie review
",Spiderman Homecoming is the 3rd attempt of Spiderman since actors Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield played the web slinger before Tom Holland took over and this film doesn't focus on Peter Parker being bitten by a spider and falling for MJ Watson or Gwen Stacey but a follow up to Captain America Civil War as Holland made his debut as the web slinger Spiderman who wants to join the avengers. Tony Stark(aka Iron Man played by Robert Downey Jr) helps Peter Parker with the making of his suit as we as giving him advice about joining his team dubbed The Avengers. Meanwhile there's a villain called Vulture played by Micheal Keaton from Batman fame who wants to rule mankind and its up to Spidey to save the day and discover who Vulture really is.I actually bought the DVD of it for the Xmas and I was skeptic about it at first as I hated that they were rebooting this again after Andrew Garfields disaster sequel The Amazing Spiderman 2 which in fairness I enjoyed. Tom Holland reminded me of Andrew Garfield in this film and I liked how they focused more on Peter Parker and in High School and not doing the same scenario of Peter getting bitten again. Overall I enjoyed it.,7,0,0,27 December 2017
The Bodyguard," Incredibly underrated
","The Bodyguard is a 1992 Oscar Nominated film starring Kevin Costner and the late Whitney Houston and tells the story of a bodyguard named Frank Farmer (Costner) who is assigned to protect a well known pop star named Rachel Merrion(Houston) who is been stalked and threatened to be killed by a twisted killer. Although romance does blossom between Rachel and Frank,will Frank catch the stalker/killer who is trying to kill Rachel in time?Overall the story is great,but the real reason why this film is good is for the music which is mostly done by Whitney Houston herself. The real twist with the killer is surprising as it builds up to allow the audience to assume that it's the white haired guy who has photos of Rachel everywhere but nope it's not him.
<<>Spoiler alert>>>
It was Portman(who used to work with Frank) was the real killer all along. Nominated for 2 Oscars and won a Razzie for worst movie back in 1992(if I'm correct),this is actually not as bad as the critics were saying it was going to be.
Good film.",7,0,1,29 March 2019
Begin Again," Shocked by how great this film was
","I picked this up yesterday on sale as I never heard of it before and since I love music I said to myself I might as well see what its about. The film which was originally called Can A Song Save Your Life before it was changed to Begin Again sees a down on his luck drunk named Dan played by Mark Ruffalo from 13 Going On 30)who's marriage is on the rocks and his daughter played by Hailee Steinfield dresses inappropriately for her age.Of course Dan ends up being sacked from his job as a music producer and one night stumbles on an open mic session where he hears a young woman singing. Turns out that this young woman is Gretta (played by Kiera Knightly from Pirates Of The Caribbean)who's friend Steve(played by James Corden from Into The Woods)suggested Gretta to sing live causing her to get noticed by Dan. So Dan takes Gretta under his wing and decides to make her into a star by making music videos and everything for her to make it to the top again. Of course Gretta stopped singing for a long time having split up with her partner Dave Grohl(played by Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine in his film debut)as she was a singer/songwriter too just like Dave(as we see this in a flashback)and she decides to make it big again.Overall this film is a must see for music lovers,the acting was very good,Mark Ruffalo was terrific as the drunken washed up disgraced music producer who swears quite a lot,Kiera Knightly was very good as Gretta(more on Knightly in a minute)and the rest of the film was very good. The singing by Kiera Knightly I must say is brilliant,who knew that she had a beautiful singing voice and she plays the guitar very well too. I was shocked by how good she was in this movie. Between Kiera and Zachary Levi(who shocked me in Tangled when he sung in that film, as well as the likes of Hugh Jackman,James Marsden etc all these guys should seriously just release an album as they all have fantastic singing voices). Bottom line I really enjoyed it and if you haven't seen it yet then please do.Thumbs Up GoodB-",7,0,0,22 October 2015
Megamind," A good spin on the superhero movies but Tangled FTW
","Megamind is a 2010 animated fantasy sci-fi comedy that pokes fun of Superman mostly and tells the story about an alien named Megamind voiced by Will Ferrell from Bewitched,who is the world's most evil villain who sets to defeat Metro Man voiced by Brad Pitt who happened to be in Sinbad Legend Of The Seven Seas who is the hero in the movie. Problems arise from Megamind as he falls in love with News Reporter Roxanne Hart voiced by 30 Rock star Tina Fey who clearly can't stand Megamind. But when Metro Man fakes his own death its up to Megamind to create a new villain but of course the plan backfires as Roxanne's chief assistant Hal voiced by Superbad's Jonah Hill becomes the villain instead of the hero and comes up with a name called Titan,its up to Megamind to save the day.So what do I like about this movie well for starters the humor is great along with the animation which is brilliant,but I guess my main problem with this film is the story,its sometimes very complicated to follow as we see Megamind falling from out of the sky in the beginning and I thought hey what is Megamind falling from his death for and what really happened to his parents and why is Metro Man heading to Earth with Megamind is he an alien like him too posing as a human I dunno its all choppy for me and I also found it very slow pacing too,I mean if you take Tangled that movie had such a fast pacing and it was over before I could spot anything in that film,but Tangled was better in my opinion for the story here like I said for Megamind was too slow and I really didn't care about Roxanne either and her relationship with Megamind it just doesn't work for me these two.But having said that it was an enjoyable romp but its definitely not in my top 10 favourite animated movies of all time.",6,0,2,10 May 2013
The Polar Express," Very good Christmas movie
","The Polar Express is a 2004 motion capture film directed by Robert Zurkenkis who is over Back To The Future franchise and tells the tale of a young boy who comes across a mysterious train ran by a conductor voiced by Tom Hanks and the little boy goes off on a magical journey to see Santa Clause in the North Pole. So will the little boy go back home?Overall I thought the film was very good,the motion capture was very good as I liked how the conductor was like Tom Hanks and the animation is very similar to the Jim Carrey film A Christmas Carol that was made in 2009. The story is good but the animation is definitely the show stealer in this film.If you love motion capture films and you are a fan of Tom Hanks then check it out. I really liked it,and its perfect to watch this holiday season.",8,2,3,11 December 2016
Suicide Squad," Not that great
","Suicide Squad came out in 2016 and stars Will Smith, Margot Robbie(both were in Focus in 2015),Cars Delavagie,Jai Courtney and Viola Davis and tells the story about supervillians who are teamed up and have to save the world .This film is so hard to follow and very choppy. Margot Robbie was great as Harley Quinn and Will Smith was good too. Jared Leto is barely in this film as the Joker. The special effects are good and I liked the soundtrack but this film is no Spiderman 2 or XMen2.C-Ben Affleck makes a 5 minute cameo as Batman.",5,1,2,17 March 2019
Elf," Great for the holiday season but a bit silly
",I watched this last night as it was on TV and there was nothing on at all last night so I said since we are reaching the holidays I might as well watch it. The movie is similar to Enchanted in a way(minus the animation)and it tells the story of a man who is raised by Santa's elf's and he goes to NYC to find his biological father who is a writer apparently . Buddy(Ferrell) then meets a girl named Jovie(Zooey Deshnail who is a dead ringer to Katy Perry)and becomes smitten with her.I may not be a fan of Will Ferrell but I laughed at a few parts to this movie like the part where he is singing the Baby its cold outside song from Tom Jones and the part where he humiliates his father at work by some guy who he called an elf too LOL that was hilarious.The movie is a bit stupid but I like fish out of water movies as I like how the characters interact with our world and that. I liked some parts to it but the ending was quite dumb. So I am giving it a 6 simply because its nearly Xmas and I like to get into the Holiday season.,6,5,10,21 November 2010
Tangled," HANDS down my all time favourite movie ever
","As a lover for fairy tales like The Little Mermaid ,Beauty & the Beast and Aladdin,Disney went downhill with their last movie The Princess & the Frog and since then there wasn't a decent flick since 2007's Enchanted which was my all time favorite animated/live action movie.Yesterday I went to the cinemas by myself and I saw Tangled. Tangled is an up to date version of the classic Brother Grimns story Rapunzel. The story opens with a male voice telling the tale about a princess who was abducted by an evil woman named Mother Gothel who stoled the baby from her parents as she has healing magic powers that can heal and turn an old person back into their youthful form. Apparently the princesses's mother was sick and the guards from the palace found a healing flower and that is why Gothel stole the child. Fast forward a few years later and Rapunzel(voiced by MANDY MOORE)wishes to see the lantern lights as they appear every year for her birthday and she was celebrating her 18th birthday but Mother Gothel(voiced by DONNA MURPHY)doesn't want Rapunzel to leave the tower ever. Meanwhile a dashing rogue thief named Flynn Rider(who's real name is Eugene Fitzherbert)(voiced by Zac Levi)steals a crown from the palace and as he tries to find the perfect hideout for the stolen crown he spots a isolated tower and climbs up to the top,little does he realize he gets hit by a frying pan(yeah a frying pan )from Rapunzel who thinks Flynn is interested in her long 70ft blonde hair which glows when she sings that HEALING INCANTATION song. She hides the satchel where Flynn can't find it and she makes a deal with him that she will give it back to him if he takes her to see the lanterns for her 18th birthday and as she leaves her tower for the first time in 18 years she is about to go on a hair-raising hilarious adventure where she falls in love,and sees the outside world for the first time.The animation in this film is so exquisite part of you would think its a live action movie and not CGI. The music(done by the brilliant composer of our generation ALAN MENKEN)was brilliant and memorable especially the songs I SEE THE LIGHT(both sung by LEVI & MOORE),WHEN WILL MY LIF E BEGIN,and the villain song MOTHER KNOWS BEST. The story was brilliant yet kind slow enough to follow but as the film progressed I fell head over heels in love with the charcthers and the story I never blinked not once and I never looked at my watch throughout the 1hr and 36 mins. Mandy Moore was perfect for the voice role of Rapunzel I loved how her charcther progresses throughout the film and I love how she and Flynn(aka Eugene Fitzherbert I think this name is nice btw very Irish indeed)don't see eye to eye but they soon fall for one another when they see the lanterns (which was brilliant I must say I loved that part)and sing the song I SEE THE LIGHT(brilliant love song I can't get the song out of my head).ZAC LEVI was so hilarious in this film ('Her hair glows why does her hair glow' or 'Oh no no no this is not good they just can't get my nose right) I think Eugene Fitzherbert is the hottest Disney charcther alive. One scene that had me in tears(well almost)was the part where he apparently dies and before that he chops off Rapunzel's 70 ft hair that turns back into brown and he dies. She sings that healing song and her tears brought him back to life. The finale was so cute and heartwarming. TANGLED is without a doubt one of the best Disney animated films I have ever seen in my entire life since Beauty & the Beast(yes people it was THAT GOOD). Its got romance,memorable music,lovable charcthers,heartwarming ending,hilarious moments from the horse Maximus who had me in tears of laughter and the cute chameleon Pascal who uses his tongue to wake up Eugene when he gets knocked out from the frying pan incident and exquisite animation. I may be 19 going on 20 but this was the best 1 hr and 36 Min's of my life. Simply enchanting.BEST QUOTE:Eugene Fitzhebert: 'You were my new dream'Rapunzel:(cries)'And you were mine'BEST SCENE: The lantern scene was amazing I simply loved it so much.orThe part where Flynn almost dies and he sacrifice's Rapunzel's hair by chopping it all off. If you liked Stardust(evil woman wants girl for youth),Anastasia(lost princess falls for a bad boy),Shrek(hilarious adult humor), and The Little mermaid(boat scene)you will love this.FINAL VERDICT: Tangled is an instant classic that should be treasured for the rest of your life.10/10 Brilliant simply amazing I am in love with this film. Move over Princess & the frog this film is here to stay. But I hope they won't decide to do a sequel as it will ruin the magic in this film.",10,7,10,5 February 2011
Doctor Strange," Solely for the special effects. Story is decent.
","Dr Strange came out in 2016 and stars Benedict Cumberbatch as the title charcther Dr Steven Strange,a brilliant surgeon who's life is cut short as he gets involved in a car crash and is unable to use his hands. So he travels abroad to Asia where he stumbles across the ancient one played by Tilda Swinton who trains Steven as a superhero who can use his hands to save mankind.The story is good, along with the acting. But the bigger points goes to the special effects as they are breaking and vivid.Also starring Rachel McAdams and Chiworl Elfifor I found this one not bad.Check it out before it leave a Netflix for good.C+",6,1,2,3 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Good the visuals,bad the story lacks
","So I just finished watching the finale of Star Wars on Disney + and well let's dig in.The Rise of Skywalker is mainly about Rey (Daisy Ridley) who learns a dark secret about herself and has to choose between good and evil. So she sets off solo,finds Ben Skywalker(Adam Driver) and goes on a head to head.The visuals are great,especially the late Carrie Fisher (who died in 2016 ) who appears as Princess Leila in this film with a surprise cameo from Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford.If your a fan of Star Wars then you might be either happy or disappointed. For me I thought it was alright. Probably watch it again down the line again,but its nothing to write home about to be honest.",6,3,8,7 May 2020
The Devil Wears Prada," Good movie

But how long will Andy stick at her job as Miranda's assistant?
The acting is good,the story is enjoyable and overall I enjoyed this movie. Meryll Streep was very good in this movie. Every movie that she stars in she's completely different in them all and she creates these personas.
Also stars Simon Baker(from The Mentalist).",7,0,0,21 June 2020
Romeo + Juliet," A modern day twist to the star crossed lovers
","I haven't seen this movie in a very long time but quite frankly I remember the WHOLE thing. The film (which uses A lot of quotes as the actors Leonardo Di Caprio and Claire Danes are always speaking like they are saying a poem or whatever)is about two people; Romeo(played by Di Caprio from my all time favourite live action movie Titanic)and Juliet(played by a unrecognizable yet fresh looking Claire Danes from Stardust)who meet at the Gala duo and fall in love. But with Juliet's restricted parents will she ever meet her Romeo again?Bottom line this movie is well OK I guess but my main problem is with all the poetic like quotes that the actors use like I mentioned before,I dunno its like annoying at times,yet Claire and Leo did a tremendous job as the two cross lovers who marry eventually and of course tragedy strikes(yeah and if you want to know what that is well here it is. SpoilersRomeo gets poisoned and Juliet(who cannot live without him)grabs his gun and shoots herself and dies in the church with him. Overall it wasn't my cup of tea and the ending as terrible so i'm giving it a 4/10",4,0,0,25 May 2013

So Scott uses his new powers to save the day.The visuals are great,the story is good and I really enjoyed Paul Rudd as Ant-Man. The action sequences are great too.Stick around for the credits as their is two post credit scenes. One involving Evangeline Lily becoming the Wasp,by seeing the wasp costume and the other one has Chris Evans in it.",7,0,0,24 March 2019
American Hustle," Saw like 10 minutes of this and turned it off
",This happened to be on Channel 4 the other night and I decided to see bits of it. The story is about two con artists both played by The Dark Knight's Christian Bale(looking unrecongisble )and Enchanted's Amy Adams who are partners in crime who team up with some FBI agent (played by The Hangover's Bradley Cooper sporting a perm in this 1970s styled flick)and they get help from him. Also starring Jennifer Lawerence from Silver Lining's Playbook. I couldn't grasp this movie at all I found it very boring and bland and I decided to turn it off to another channel. If you like the actors in this than that's fair enough but for me it wasn't my cup of tea AND I am a fan of Amy Adams and Bradley Cooper.,2,1,2,8 March 2016
10 Things I Hate About You," Good teen comedy from the late 90s starring the late Heath Ledger
","10 Things I Hate About You was released in 1999 and stars Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger and tells the story of this guy called Cameron(Joseph Gordon Levitt)who is in love with a girl called Bianca(Larissa Oleynik)who is a very prim and proper. The problem is her father (played by Larry Miller)doesn't want her to date anyone until her older sister Kat(played by Julia Stiles)starts to date as he has a no sex policy. Of course Cameron and his friend bribe a strange handsome guy named Patrick(played by the late Heath Ledger)to go out with Kat in order for Cameron to date Bianca. Of course there is another guy who is a real douchbag named Joey(Andrew Keegan) who also bribes Patrick to date Kat so he can steal Bianca from Cameron. As Patrick begins to see Kat however he ends up falling for her for real and doesn't want to go through with the bribe anymore. But will they won't they get together?
Overall I found this film entertaining and funny in some parts. The music is very rock/pop,the setting was nice and the plot reminded me of another teen romantic comedy called She's All That which came out the exact year as this as the plot to that film was similar to this film but sorta different at the same time. Both Julia and Heath had great chemistry together as both were newcomers at the time since Heath was in Home And Away in the mid 90s before he went to Hollywood till his death in 2008.
If you liked She's All That,How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days then you will enjoy this.",7,1,1,1 August 2018
Notting Hill," A better than your average romantic comedy starring Hugh Grant
","Notting Hill tells the tale of a man named William Thatcher(Grant)who's life is well let's say not that great. His gone through a divorce from his first wife and he owns a book shop that sells travel books(I swear the bookstore reminds me of the book store Meg Ryan was working in You've Got Mail opposite Tom Hanks)anyway one day however and a mysterious woman shows up looking at books. He asks her what would she like and she is very discreet to him and says she's fine. But when she leaves the bookstore he discovers that she is the famous American actress Anna Foster(Julia Roberts). And later bumps into her again as he accidentally spilled orange juice on her t-shirt,and from here on in an inevitably romance blossoms between the two of them. Trouble comes however when Anna's American boyfriend shows up(Alec Baldwin from 30 Rock)and it causes a stir on her relationship with William as well as the paparazzi spying on her as they found out she was sleeping with William. So will they,won't they get together in the end. Bottom line I haven't seen this movie in over 10 years since last night as it happened to be on TV and I decided to watch it again as I had it all forgotten. Julia Roberts is one of my favourite actresses of all time so any film she is in I have to watch it for her. Hugh Grant is well Hugh Grant in any film he is in. Boring,dry and just down right dull. But here he wasn't that bad in it. However him and Julia Roberts chemistry was kinda average to be honest. I felt that they were uncomfortable in this film,but it wasn't all that bad. But the show stopper here of course in Rhys Ifans(from The Amazing Spiderman as Dr Curt Connors)as Spike. He was hilarious in this movie and every time he appeared on screen he cracked me up. Also starring is the guy who I think was on a programme called Black Books and the man who played Glen Close's henchmen Tim McInnvery as Grant's brother in law.Overall I found it enjoyable and I recommend it to those who are a fan of Grant or Roberts.7/10",7,0,1,13 July 2015
Bohemian Rhapsody," Very good biopic based on Freddie Mercury
","Bohemian Rhapsody is a 2018 film based on Freddie Mercury and on how Queen was formed as well as the lead up to Live Aid 1985. Rami plays the lead who started off working as a cabin baggage attendant in Heathrow airport who lives with his parents and his sister . He spots a band called Smile and the lead singer quits the band so Freddie asks could he be in the band and the rest is history. He changes his name to Freddie Mercury,as well as changing the band's name to Queen,getting to fall in love with a woman before it's later revealed his bisexual and falls for a man named Paul before he ends up with Jim. Of course there's conflict later on with Queen over Freddie's stardom.Overall the film was very good. Rami Malek was excellent as Freddie Mercury I was shocked by how he looked like him along with the guy who played Brian May. The music was good and the overall story was excellent. I never knew that Freddie was a Pakistan and was half Indian as I never knew about Freddie's background only he was the lead singer of Queen and died of Aids in 1991(27 years ago).Despite the fact I preferred A Star Is Born but I still found this film very good noneoftheless.
9/10.Keep an eye out for Ben Hardy who was in Eastenders one time as one of Freddie's band mates and an unreconisable Mike Myers who hasn't acted in years.",9,1,3,4 November 2018
Bird Box," Actually pretty good
","Bird Box which is based off a book, is the latest Netflix movie starring Sandra Bullock as a young woman who we see telling her children not to take their blind folds off as if they do they will die. We then fast forward back and forth where we see strange things happening to people including Sarah Paulsen who plays Bullocks friend who dies after being hit by a car and everyone dies due to some strange occurrence. But what is it and will Bullock and her remaining friend survive the apocalypse?Overall at first I didn't know what to expect as the reason I watched this was for Sandra Bullock who I have been a fan of since Speed and While you were sleeping ;so it was nice to see her try something different than the other genres she is known for romantic comedies.If you are one who loves seeing a lot of blood and violence then check it out",6,2,10,21 December 2018
Baby Driver," A great film with a deceiving title
","Baby Driver is a 2017 Action Crime film starring The Fault In Our Stars Ansel Elgort,Cinderella's Lily James,Superman Returns star Kevin Spacey and The Amazing Spiderman 2 star Jamie Foxx and tells the tale of a young getaway driver named Baby(Elgort)who works for a crime boss(played by Spacey)and uses Baby's talent to steal stuff and get involved with crime. As one criminal gets killed,Baby ends up working for another bunch of criminals led by Jon Hamm and his on screen girlfriend Eliza Gonzalez and the try and steal a bank. Baby has a condition called Tintitis which is an ear disorder and since his parents died in a car crash years ago Baby uses his Ipod and listens to music which helps him with his companions. But when Baby falls for a Southern waitress named Debora(Lily James) can he protect her and his bad companions from danger.Overall from beginning to end this film is packed with car chasing scenes which were very well done. The chemistry between Ansel and Lily was very good(even though it was funny because all I could think of was Hazel with Augustus in The Fault In Our Stars and Ella with Kit in Cinderella). Kevin Spacey was good as the crime boss and Jon Hamn as the villain(you could say)was very good too. Jamie Foxx was hilarious and everything about the film was excellent.I seen this last night in my local cinema and I was surprised that a lot of girls were at it younger than me(yes im a girl and I love action films depending on what they are I suppose)and a few guys were at it too. The title though does look deceiving because you think its about a baby who drives a car and its more of a comedy title than an action title. If it was known as The Getaway or Fast than it wouldn't be deceiving with its title. If you love a good car chasing film than check this one out. Its original,its clever and I wouldn't mind watching it again. 7/10",7,5,11,3 July 2017
Grease," The original High School Musical only better than it
","You all know this musical by now. Everyone knows what this film is about. The story is about two teenagers named Sandy and Danny(played by John Travolta and Olivia Newton John) who meet one summer during school break and fall in love. But surprise surprise they lose each other and never see each other again. Fast forward now and Danny and his mates are goofing around and guess who is starting his school why its Sandy of course who is originally from Sydney Austrailia and just moved to the states so she befriends the Pink Ladies which is owned by Stockard Channing's charcther.So when Sandy and Danny bump into each other Sandy gets upset because Danny was acting like a jerk to her as his a real swagger and appears to be a very cocky person. So will they won't they get together,you have to find out.Bottom line I grew up watching this as a kid back in the 90s(despite the fact this film has been out since 1978)and I knew all the songs once they showed up and all and all its a feel good musical. My favourite song in the movie has to be Your The One That I Want where Danny sees Sandy in the end all done up and Danny is shocked to see the new Sandy Dee sporting tight leather pants.If you love musicals and you like John Travolta or any of the cast then check it out. I was glad to have bought this along with its sequel(which I have yet to watch)on DVD.",9,0,1,18 February 2015
Lilo & Stitch," One word to describe this movie and that's cute
","Lilo & Stitch is Disney's 41st animated classic released in 2002 and tells the story about an Alien named Experiment 626(who will be later called Stitch) voiced by Chris Sanders(who left Disney and went on to direct one of my all time favourite animated movies How To Train Your Dragon)who apparently leaves his planet as he escapes in his spaceship shuttle and comes to earth as a puppy that is later bought by Lilo(voiced by Davleigh Chase)who's parents died and is in remanded custody with her sister Nani. As Stitch spends some time with Lilo while his inventor and his sidekick is also in Earth keeping an eye out on him,he discovers the meaning of family which is this line 'Ohio means family,family means nobody gets left behind'. Now that was a good message as this film values families and trust and that's what I liked about it.Now to the bad I dunno about you but parts of the film was kinda bland for me,I dunno why but it wasn't as hilarious as let's say Aladdin,it was sort of depressing in a way,but still I did enjoy this movie.Overall I'm giving it a 6.",6,0,2,6 July 2013
Split," A movie about split personalities and abduction
","Split is a 2016 film and stars James McAvoy as a man who kidnaps 3 teenage girls and locks them in a basement where he becomes different people as he has a personality disorder. One of the girls named Casey befriends the man with the split personality who we later find out was molested as a child by her own uncle (been done on flashbacks of course).
So will the girls be able to escape from this madman(Kevin) and his alter ego beast?Overall this film is slightly disturbing in a way as we get to see Kevin as different people - both male and female and we also get to see him pay a visit to psychology nurse who deals with mental patients.The reason I watched this was because I heard a lot of people saying it was good and that it's actually a sequel to the Bruce Willis flick unbreakable which came out in 2000 and there is a sequel to both this and Split called Glass.
If your a fan of M Night Shaylan than check it out.I found it not bad but I wouldn't watch it again .",4,0,1,6 January 2019

This time around and Voldermort(Ralph Fiennes)wants Harry Potter dead and so there is deadly hallows lurking around. Its up to Harry,Ron and Hermoine to destroy them once and for all and get rid of this necklace that makes a user jealous(as Ron gets jealous of Harry and Hermoine bonding). Overall the effects are very good and the acting is decent. This was the film(well franchise I should say) that introduced me to Emma Watson. She will always be Hermoine Granger no matter what other film she is in(Beauty & The Beast was very good btw).Overall if you are a fan of the franchise I say check it out.",7,1,2,17 June 2017
The Shining," Very creepy with spoilers.
",SO I never seen this film before and I decided to catch the last half on it on TV. BOY this was the most creepiest films ever. Jack Nicholson plays a psychopath who takes his wife and child to a house. But he slowly loses his mind and threatens to kill them both.Of course since its a horror film(and I'm not a horror fan WHATSOEVER) if you love a good scare then check it out. But one line that I know off by heart is this lineHere's JOHNNYI found the ending to be a bit weird as well like did he go back to the year 1921 when he got frozen in the end?,1,2,10,5 November 2013
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Best Spiderman film right next to the Sam Rami version
","Spiderman Into The Spidey Verse is a 2018 animated film starring Shamelik Moore,Nicolas Cage and Chris Pine and tells the story of Miles Morlales who gets bitten with a genetic spider and meets up with past spidermen along with Spideypig and Spidey Gwen(Hailey Steinfield) who all help Miles protect and save the world from Kingpin(unreconisable Liev Schrieber).
The animation is stunning,the voice cast is excellent and everything else was brilliant. If you are a massive fan of Spiderman then you will love this film.Quite frankly the best since Tobey Maguire's Spiderman.From the directors of The Lego Movie. Also features the late Stan Lee which this film is dedicated to along with Steve Ditko.",9,0,15,29 April 2019
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," Hey I liked this movie better when it was called The Lion King
","This half piece of nothing is a COMPLETE knock off of The Lion King just LIKE Disney's CGI flick The Wild. Alex finds out he has a dad,the dad owns the land,his evil brother doesn't want him to rule the land blah blah blah.The story picks off right after the first one and Alex(voiced by Ben Stiller) and his gang(Jada Pinkett Smith as the Hippo Gloria,David Schwimmer as the giraffe Melmon,and Chris Rock as Marty the Zebra)end up in Africa where Alex finds out that he has a father (voiced by the late actor Bernie Mac) but his evil brother (voiced by 30 Rock's Alec Baldwin) doesn't want him to rule the land and so he comes up with a plan to get rid of Alec's dad.The animation is great,the charcthers are great but seriously though is Dreamwork's TRYING to become Disney?? like Disney trying to be Pixar or Dreamwork's for that matter with the animation in CGI form.Yeah if I were you guys i'd skip this one and watch the original instead.",3,1,2,14 May 2013
Edward Scissorhands," In my opinion the best Johnny Depp film I have seen out of his career
","OK to get things clear I am not a fan of Johnny Depp's at all as a lot of his movies tend to be creepy and he acts rather creepy in his movies. But in this film let me tell ya he won me over as the shy Edward Scissorhands. Edward Scissorhands you see was created by an inventor who tragically passed away(played by Horror actor Vincent Price) who was going to give him prosthetic hands for Edward,but instead he ends up with scissors as hands and finds it awkward. All that is about to change for Edward as he is taken in by a lovely lady who happens to have a daughter named Kim(who happens to be the narrator aka the old lady you see in the beginning of the film played by Wionna Rider)who Edward begins to fall in love with. But will she love him for his scissor hands and his scars?Bottom line this was a very beautiful fantasy. The plot reminds me of Beauty & The Beast for some strange odd reason and Johnny Depp was very good as Edward Scissorhands who is a very modest young man (sporting a Micheal Jackson hairdo)and his charcther Edward you actually feel really bad for him as people are out to get him,including this one guy who tries to kill him and Edward fights back. Overall I recommend this film to anyone who loves fantasy and Johnny Depp in total. Also the score by Danny Elfman was very haunting and beautiful and Tim Burton done a marvelous job behind the directors chair.8/10",8,2,4,18 March 2015
Silver Linings Playbook," Very good movie starring the lovely Bradley Cooper
","Silver Linings Playbook is a novel based on the same name and tells the story of a young man named Pat (played by Bradley Cooper from the Hangover) who suffers from Bipolar Disorder and is released from the Mental ward along with his friend(played by Rush Hour's Chris Tucker) who wasn't suppose to come out at all yet as they both bailed out. Pat lives with his mother and father(played by Robert De Niro and Jackie Weaver)and he is very optimistic that his wife will reconcile with him as she left him,and his job got the sack along with everything else he had. But one night when Pat is invited to a party in another friend of his house who is married(played by Julia Stiles from Save The Last Dance),he meets a bad-mouthed cynical young woman named Tiffany(played by Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawerence) who's husband died in a freak accident and she's got a lot of problems to deal with since his death. They both make a deal that if Pat helps Tiffany with the dance rehearsals she will help him get back with his wife by giving him a letter, but did Pat's wife really sent that letter to him and how will his relationship with Tiffany(who he later falls for in the movie)get on?Overall this Oscar Winning movie is very good as it was my first time last night to watch it as I got the DVD of it and quite frankly i think Bradley Cooper SHOULD have won an Oscar for his performance as the mentally young man who swears,and throws tantrums like a child and whenever he hears a certain song it triggers him and he loses his temper whenever he hears it playing. Jennifer Lawrence was also good as the slightly delusional young woman who has a bad temper and a foul mouth. Overall it was a good movie and if you love Bradley Cooper than check it out.Final rating its a 8.",8,2,3,8 January 2014
Save the Last Dance," A very good dance flick.
","Save The Last Dance is a 2001 Paramount Pictures film and tells the tale of a inspiring ballerina named Sara(played by Julia Stiles from 10 Things I Hate About You)who gives up her life as a ballerina as her mother died in a fatal car crash leaving her to grief over her mother and move to a new town with her step dad Roy(well she doesn't call him dad so I prosume his her stepfather). Sara goes to a new school that's mixed race and meets a girl called Charlene(played by Kerry Washington)and her handsome brother Derek(played by Sean Patrick Thomas)who Sara later falls for. Derek helps Sara accomplish her dream again to go to Julliard and become a ballerina as she told him that she was the one to blame for her mom's death and so he decides to teach her some hip hop dancing in an old building that's set to be renewed.Together with the help of Hip Hop dancing and ballet can Sara ever get the chance to do what she dreamt of doing.Predictable yet familiar to Step Up,Save The Last Dance is a very entertaining flick and it should get more than 5.9 out of 10 on IMDb. I didn't see this film since it was on TV years ago and I got it on DVD yesterday for a bargain at PLAY and I decided to watch it 10 Min's ago. My main issue is the way they treat white people and call them trashy and whatever and Derek's mix doesn't want him to be with Sara because she's not colored like him,now that is pure racism but still this movie was very good.A 7 out of 10.",7,1,3,18 August 2013
Dreamgirls," From the man that directed Beauty and The Beast comes this winning musical
","Dreamgirls was released in 2006 and stars Beyonce,Anki Noni Rose, Jennifer Hudson,Eddie Murphy and Jamie Foxx and tells the tale of the supremes who were a 60s girl group that made it big in Hollywood and start off as the opening act for James Thunder Early (Murphy);but when one of them becomes more popular(Knowles) which leads (Hudson's)charcther becoming jealous of her will the 3 girls reunite again ?Overall its been years since I last seen this film. The cinematography was good since the same guy that did the remake for Beauty and the Beast did this too back in 2006. This film is also a full blown musical,some of the songs were memorable like Listen,We Are A Family,Hey Baby etc the real star is Jennifer Hudson who stole the whole film with her powerful voice which helped her earn an Oscar BTW. Eddie Murphy is in it too and he sings but his songs went over my head. But on the flip side his a good singer since he was a singer back in the 80s.
Overall I did enjoy this film as it pays homage to the 60s and 70s. The Princess And The Frog's Anki Nomi Rose was good in this too.

Face_Off," Campy action thriller that's actually very good
","Face/Off is a 1997 Action Thriller starring John Travolta and Nicholas Cage and tells the story of an FBI agent named Sean Archer (Travolta) who's son was killed by a terrorist called Castor Troy(Cage). But when Castor is out for revengence by planting a bomb Sean decides to swap faces with Castor in order to find the bomb. But when Castor awakens after surgery,he ends up taking Sean's face and posing as Sean.Overall it was a very good flick. The special effects are great,the way Travolta mimics Nicholas Cage while Cage mimics Travolta was very good and the story was great too.If you watch The Simpsons they actually made fun of this film with Sideshow Bob and Walter swapping faces.If your a fan of Cage or Travolta then you'll like this film. Also Cage acts like Jim Carrey in some scenes.",7,0,3,29 April 2019

Problems arise however when a girl that goes to High School with Sebastian falls for her as Sebastian and Viola done up like Sebastian falls for for Duke(Channing Tatum).But will Viola ever reveal her real identity to the guys??Overall it was hilarious and a good movie to watch on a lazy afternoon. Im not a fan of cross-dressing movies but I enjoyed it. Bynes is hilarious in any movie she's in and it was a pleasure to watch it.Check it out and see what you think of it.",7,0,0,1 August 2013
Spider-Man," Surprisingly a good flick and this is coming from a girl who is a hopeless romantic
","I admit it I usually go for movies that are romantic or musical flicks like Grease or HSM but I actually liked Spiderman since I was a child as there was no Hannah Montana,Sabrina the Teenage witch which came out in 1996.The film version of Spiderman is about a young nerdy guy named Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire who is now replaced by Andrew Garfield in the rebooted version)who isn't the popular guy in school as guys give him a tough time as he is in love with a girl who is his next door neighbor Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst)who is quite popular in school.One day he goes to some school trip all about spiders and as he takes a photo of Mary Jane he gets bit by a spider and he becomes Spiderman a superhero who fights the bad guys in New York City as his uncle got killed by a robber(who is actually Flint Marco which you can see in the 3rd francise which is rubbish BTW that killed Ben aka Peter's uncle).Meanwhile Peter's best friend's father turns into Green Goblin by some syrup stuff and he is the villain in this movie.What I like about Spiderman is that it edgy,creative and although its a guys flick but girls who like a man that can kick butt might fancy him . The cast is good yet its too bad that they didn't give the role to Mary Jane Watson to Amy Adams or whoever as Kirsten Dunst was a bit of a bitch in this film she's always moaning and whining like a baby and she just annoys me,Tobey Maguire was OK as Peter but having said that he was great,the music is great as for everything else.I'll give it a 7/10",7,0,1,10 October 2010
Shrek Forever After," The worst film of 2010 so far
","As much as I loved the other 3 but this was like watching Cinderella III: A twist in time it was so bad. Shrek is now a family man but there is one thing that he misses the most,being a grumpy ogre again so what happens a ugly man named Raspunkin makes a deal with him and suddenly he ends up being in an alternative version of Far Far Away. Now Shrek must find Fiona and make her kiss him or else he will be gone forever. The charcthers were boring,Eddie Murphy wasn't interesting as Donkey anymore and it just wasn't good enough as I would have thought. Some things have being bugging me about this film like why isn't Fiona not a human and why is Puss in Boots a household cat. This and Spiderman 3 is crap. Not worth watching and avoid at all costs.",1,3,9,21 September 2010
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," What was this one about again?
","I have this film totally forgotten as I haven't seen it in years. Pretty much like the first 2 all the actors are back except for the actor who played Dumbledore as he passed away in 2002(Richard Harris) and was replaced by Micheal Gambon. I think this one had a dragon in it or was that the Goblet Of Fire? Overall the film was fairly good,Harry Potter is more stubborn now and even blows up his aunt in the beginning of the film. Harry of course is looking for Sirus Black(Gary Oldman) who maybe over Harry Potter's death.",5,3,4,22 April 2017
Bad Teacher," Saw this on Channel Four last night not bad
","Bad Teacher is about a good for nothing teacher named Elizabeth played by Cameron Diaz who uses her job to earn money to get breast implants as well as only sitting at her desk showing her class a bunch of DVDs that aren't in relation to schoolwork. Problems arise however when she starts to fall for a teacher called Scott(played by Justin Timberlake)who Amy Squirrel(played by British Actress Lucy Punch who starred in Ella Enchanted back in 2004,while here she sports an American accent which was really good BTW)has a crush on and wants to do all in her power for Scott to be with her,but Elizabeth hates Amy and one point she frames her for drugs which Amy didn't use as Amy was looking for drugs in Elizabeth's desk.Later ANOTHER teacher has the hot's for Elizabeth played by Jason Segal from The Muppets and Elizabeth has to choose either Scott or Segal's character.Overall Bad Teacher wasn't a bad film and Cameron Diaz is a good actress,here she sorta reminded me of Michelle Phieffer as she's a lot older compare to her film debut The Mask back in 1994,but hey she can't help that can't she as she is in her 40s now.Overall its a 5.",5,1,4,6 January 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man," Good remake from the Tobey Maguire franchise that got rebooted
","The Amazing Spiderman is a reboot of the 2002 action fantasy starring Tobey Maguire,except this time British actor Andrew Garfield is now the man wearing the blue spandex tights,the tight red top and the spidey mask,along with the red boots.The story kicks off with Peter Parker as a kid and his parents bring him to his Aunt May(Sally Field)and Uncle Ben's(Martin Sheen)house who rear Peter as his guardian as his parents died that night in a plane crash. Years later Peter is now a teenager and goes to High School where he has a crush on Gwen Stacey(Emma Stone) and his facing the bullies who are at him. So when he goes to OSCOP that same day after school where Dr Connors works(Rhys Ifans) he discovers some secrets about his father and the mysterious briefcase his father hid from him,as well as discovering a tree that holds spiders where he gets bit by one and starts developing superhuman powers that night. That same night he gets into a row with his uncle,causing him to go after him but Ben gets shot and Peter gets revenge on the man that shot his Uncle Ben and decides to use his superhuman powers to fight the bad guys.It may not be as good as the original 2002 film with Tobey Maguire,Kirsten Dunst and James Franco,but its still a good film to watch if you love Spiderman or just grew up watching Spiderman as a kid. Check it out and see can you untangle yourself in Spidey's web.Andrew Garfield was good as Peter and makes him more rebellious and less nerdy. Emma Stone was good as the love interest,and Rhys Ifans was good as the villain although his transformation gets very creepy to watch once the experiment he does goes horribly wrong as he wanted to grow an arm back,causing him to change into the lizard man.But hey like I said it was a good flick.Overall it gets a 7.

The Lego Movie," Silly,Stupid,but overall entertaining(some spoilers)
","The Lego Movie is a 2014 animated comedy based on the famous Lego. I didn't get the chance to see this in the Cinemas so I bought it on DVD for my brother who seen it in a friends house and I ended up watching it instead cause my brother had no interest in it since I am a big fan of animated movies ever since I was a kid.The story of this movie is pretty straight-forward. A Lego figurine called Emmett voiced by Chris Pratt is an ordinary figurine who finds it hard to make friends as nobody knows him at all. He of course meets another figurine called Wildstyle(aka Lucy) voiced by Elizabeth Banks and together the two go to different worlds(like in that 2013 flick Wreck It Ralph where Ralph enters different worlds by going into each game)here in this movie they go in by a vortex. Meanwhile an evil villain named Lord Business(aka President Business) voiced by Will Ferrell(who also voiced a villain in Mega Mind and is even in this movie as a father to a kid who built the Lego World,but we don't get to see that until the near end of the movie)is trying to take over the Lego world by destroying it and its up to Emmett who was known as the chosen one to build and create new things to stop the evil villain.In this movie there is a ton of cameos from Batman,Wonder Woman,Superman,Green Lantern,Star Wars,Michealangelo from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Cleopatra and many more in Lego form and there is a few adult jokes in there that the kids won't understand. Bottom line I thought this film was going to be so stupid but I was wrong in fact I think I enjoyed this more than my little brother who wouldn't content himself sitting down AT ALL watching this on DVD with me. If you ever played with Lego or is familiar with Lego than this is for you.If you have kids aged 5 up than this is for you.Or if you are like me a big kid at heart who LOVES animated movies than check it out too.Overall out of 5 its a 4 out of 5 and out of 10 im giving it a 7.",7,0,1,21 July 2014
Now You See Me," Finally got to see how it all began last night on TV
","Now You See Me is a mystery thriller starring Woody Harrelson,Isla Fisher.Jessie Eisenberg and Dave Franco and tells the tale of four magicians who perform a series of magical tricks and decides to rob a bank. Following them is a detective played by Mark Ruffalo who must uncover the secrets behind the four horsemen(who the magicians are known as)and crack the case alongside his co worker. But there is a twist involved between one of these characters? And you never guess who it is.Overall this film was good but the story was all over the place. Also the twist doesn't come into play till the last 5 minutes of the film. The magic tricks were good and the characters were good too. Also starring Micheal Caine and Morgan Freeman(from the Batman reboot with Christian Bale),this film is the sort of film you would watch and then forget about it in the next 24 hours.C+",5,0,0,8 July 2016
X-Men: Days of Future Past," It took me till now to see this movie and boy is it better than Avengers: Age Of Ultron (some mild spoilers)
","X-Men Days Of Future Past is a Marvel movie based on the X-Men series and came out last year. This time round and Logan(Wolverine)played by Hugh Jackman is been sent back in time to the year 1973 thanks to Kitty played by Ellen Page who uses her powers to bring Wolverine back in time so that he can stop Raven(aka Mystique)played by Silver Lining Playbook star Jennifer Lawerence from killing a doctor played by Peter Dinklage from Game Of Thrones who is set to create these robots(who reminded me of the robots in Avengers Age Of Ultron)that share the same DNA as Mystique. So Wolverine has to find young Charles(this time played by James McAvoy,as the original was Patrick Stewart who also stars in this movie)alongside the beast(Nichloas Hoult)and of course Magento(Micheal Fassebender,as the original was Ian McKellan who makes a cameo appearance too)to come together and stop Mystique from killing the creator of the sentimels. But will they convince her not to destroy the man that created the robots.Bottom line I was glad to have seen this movie today as I heard a lot of critics hailing it as the best X-Men movie going and since I am a fan of Hugh Jackman(who in my opinion is a very versatile actor of our generation)and having seen all 3 X-Men movies as a kid (the original ones) I can safely say that this was a lot better than Avengers Age Of Ultron.If you haven't seen this movie yet my advice is to watch it you won't be sorry. And since this is a Marvel movie stay tuned to the ending credits.Good: The effects are brilliant and the story is well fast paced and not confusing except for one part where (Spoiler Alert) we get to see all the mutants who were with Logan aka Wolverine before they died in the X- Men Last Stand film back in 2006 and I liked how James Marsden made a quick cameo as Cyclops and Famme Frankin as Jean Grey(Wolverine's love interest). Also Halle Berry is in it too as Storm. I loved Quicksilver who was awesome in this film. Better than Aaron Johnson's portrayal as him in Avengers 2.Bad: Nothing really to say only I got sorta confused with the scene where like I have mentioned in the good Wolverine sees all the deceased mutants again. Well if I had to pick one than its this where is Stan Lee in this movie? He always makes cameo's so its weird he wasn't in this film.Overall: This was a very good superhero movie and I give it a thumbs up.A-9/10",9,0,0,30 May 2015
Enchanted," One of my favourite Disney movies of the decade so far
","What do you get if you put Snow White,Cinderella,The Little Mermaid, Sleeping Beauty, and Beauty & the Beast into a blended machine and have it like Who Framed Roger Rabbit except have them coming to life. You get this silly,romantic,adorable fantasy tale.For the first ten minutes the movie starts off as an old-fashioned cartoon and Amy Adams (who I never heard of until I saw her in this film)plays,voices and sings as a soon to be princess named Giselle who is banished from her animated world into the real world of NYC by a magic fountain that leads to a manhole in Times Square New York City in 2007(yeah the film reminds me of that other film back in 2001 Kate & Leopold only that had a Pride & Prejuice feel to it). Lost and scared she meets a handsome attorney named Robert Philip(Patrick Dempsey from Grey's Anatomy who played Dr Derek Sheppard)who is a single divorce father of one who's ex wife left him and he tries to avoid love altogether. At first Robert finds Giselle insane and mad as she is so cheerful and annoying ('what is wrong with you' says Robert as he is embarrassed at work with Giselle) but they soon find themselves falling for one another despite the fact his suppose to pop the question to his girlfriend of 5 years Nancy Tremaine(Idina Menzel from Wicked) and Giselle is suppose to marry Prince Edward(27 Dresses star James Marsden who plays his part well here as a stupid idiot prancing around NYC looking for his long lost love who is apparently falling for someone else).Although Giselle has the best of both worlds she has to choose which man she loves and can a storybook ending survive in the real world??. The music in this is brilliant from That's How You Know performed by Ms Adams which was such a feel good song I was literally singing the song every time I watch this film to the love ballad So Close performed by Jon McLaughlin which was played in the Kings & Queens ball. The cast was excellent Amy Adams was brilliant as the irritating princess who will do your head in from time to time yet you will fall in love with her character ,Patrick Dempsey (who I didn't give a damn about at first)was really good for his first musical debut(just watch it for him you will be surprised what secret talent he has) and as for the rest they were good except Susan Sarandon I didn't like her in this movie at all she was wasted as she only arrives near the end of the film trying to finish off Giselle because she doesn't want her to marry her stepson Prince Edward. The only issue I had with this film is the amount of mistakes I spotted as I was watching it.It was packed with plot holes from the moment the wide-eyed princess was sent to our world in human form and I think it ruined it for me. As for the whole film it is so cheesy I could cringe for days but having said that it was the best 1hr and 40 mins of my life it makes me happy and it tells us that you have to accept life for what it is. Like most Disney classics this one is the best film of the 21st century. Julie Andrews (who I forgot to mention is the narrator of this film) did a brilliant job. I love the pop up book design as well especially when you see the glass slipper in the end and Giselle and Robert running around the house having fun. I highly recommend that you should check this one out its funny in some places and its not aimed for kids only its for adults too as there is quite a lot of adult humor that the kids won't get(e.g gay biker,Giselle feeling Robert's chest). This is coming from a girl who is reaching adulthood and I was so proud to see this film as it is so cleverly well done and for the credits (8 mins long) this should be for the young and old.'Let yourself be Enchanted if you just might break through'Best sceneThe that's how you know song(I was smiling for days when I watched this scene) The ballroom scene(Patrick Dempsey says it all in this movie as he can sing) The animation was beautiful(hand-drawn animation was colorful).Best Quote'But dreams do come true and maybe someday something wonderful will happen'' Because that lovey-dovey version you talk about is fantasy and one day you wake up and your in the real world'Worst bit :The dragon scene was a bit lame and too short and there is a lot of errors in this film and the characters can be a bit annoying from time to time.If you liked the movies it mocks then you will love this.FINAL VERDICT: A fairytale princess meets her real prince in Manhattan.9/10 4/5A-Enchanted you will be.Excellent stuff from Disney.",9,0,1,18 September 2010
Inside Out," And The Oscar for 2016 for Best Animated Feature Goes To
","In 1995 a man named John Lasetter opened another animated company called Pixar. Their first was Toy Story and since then Pixar has had some hits and some misses. But in 2015 marking their 15th animated film and 20 years in history making animated movies comes this enjoyable feel good film that deals with emotions.The film tells the tale of a young girl named Riley,an 11 year old who has to move to San Francisco as her father has a big promotion there and Riley has no choice but to move from Minnesota to San Francisco. The beginning of the film we see Riley as a baby and we are introduced to Joy(Amy Poelher)who is Riley's first emotion that she received since she was born. Later we see other emotions coming to play such as Anger,Fear,Disgust and of course Sadness. Together Riley's emotions help her through everyday life and once Riley's day is done new core memories come to play as well as new worlds such as Goofy Land,Family Land,Honesty Land and so on. But when Sadness accidentally makes one of Riley's dreams sad,both Sadness and Joy get sucked out of their headquarters leaving Anger,Fear and Disgust to help Riley out in her everyday life like her new hometown and help her make new friends. But will Joy and Sadness get back to the headquarters before its too late with a little helping hand from Riley's imaginary friend Bing Bong?Throughout this film Riley gets angry,sad,disgusted and frightened about San Francisco she even at one point of the film steal her mother's credit card and run away thanks to Anger who hated the idea of Riley moving to San Francisco.Overall what did I think of this movie,well surprisingly I have to admit it but its a far more superior movie than Minions. The story was brilliantly executed,the animation was flawless,the characters were very well written and the voice cast was very very good as I had no idea who was voicing who? Bottom line I highly recommend this film to an older audience who will appreciate this film more so than younger kids. My brother,my mom and myself all went to see this in 3D yesterday and I think I enjoyed it more than my mother who said it was alright,and my brother thought it was good but he liked the Minions more. As for me I thought it was better than the Minions.Oh and make sure you arrive on time as there is a short called Lava which was very stupid to be honest with ya,as its about a singing Volcano who sings about Lava and falls for another volcano.Keep an ear open for a certain YouTuber who sings Triple Dent Gum. All I gotta say is he works for Pixar Animation and can sing like a girl and a boy. Verdict: Pixar's best animated film in a long time.9.0/104.5 starsBrilliant,best animated film I have seen since Big Hero 6.",9,4,24,3 August 2015

","I may have did a review of this year's ago back in 2010 but I decided to watch it again.

But Sophie has one problem...she has no idea who her real father is. Could it be Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth or Stellan Skarsgard?
Overall this film was OK,not a patch on its 2018 sequel Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again which i found to be entertaining and feel good. The original is feel good too but it gets annoying when they burst into song every now and again.6/10Edited 6th of January 2019",6,7,9,26 December 2010

This time Woody and the gang are off on a new adventure to rescue a new toy that Bonnie(Woody and Buzz's new owner)created out of a fork(Tom Hale). When Woody meets Bo again after tracking Forky down,will he abandon his friends or not?.
The animation is stunning,the new charcthers are great especially Keanu Reeves and Christina Hendricks. The story is nowhere as good as the last 3 movies and I really hope this is the final one as to me this was a cash grab just so it can win more awards.Been a fan of Toy Story since I was a kid .7/10

The Fault in Our Stars," Grab those Kleenex tissues for this new tearjerker based on John Green's novel on the same name
","The Fault of Our Stars is about two teenagers who meet up in a support group and realize that they have one thing in common 'Cancer'. Hazel Grace Lancaster(Shailene Woodley who I have never heard of and this was the movie that introduce me to her)is a 16 year old teen who has Stage 4 Thyroid cancer who meets Gus Waters who is an 18 year old who has Bone Cancer in a support group and the two of them become friends quickly and soon they fall in love. Of course Hazel dreams of going to Amsterdam to meet an author called Peter Von Hutton(Willem Defoe)who wrote her favorite book,and her mom and her dad decide that she can go on behalf of the hospital that she goes to get herself looked after. But will her 3 day trip to Amsterdam be great or not? Also is Gus really cured from his bone cancer or is he hiding something from Hazel?A lot of films make me laugh and cry,some make me weep more make me cry so hard(I'm looking at you Marley and Me and The Lion King along with Tangled and Beeches and A Walk To Remember). But overall I was glad I got to see this today as the acting was brilliant,the story has been done before in the past,and this is based on a novel(I don't read any books at all on books turning into movies like Nicholas Sparks novels like Dear John,The Lucky One etc) but this was a good movie and a real tearjerker. I wept at a few scenes particularly at the end of the movie and like I said before the acting is very well done,especially Woodley's performance which hopefully will give her a few awards for this film alongside the guy that plays Gus(who was very handsome indeed).Overall its a 9.",9,1,3,18 June 2014
Twilight," Decided to rewatch this again after 11 years. But does it live up to the hype
","Twilight. Back in 2008 everyone was obsessed with this film when I was a teenager. They'd read the books and talk about it non stop. So the books were turned into movies fron 2008 to 2012.
Review
The film is about a teenager named Bella Swan(Kristen Stewart)who falls in love with a mysterious boy named Edward Cullen(Robert Pattinson) who is hiding a secret. It turns out that his a vampire. Yes I am not kidding here he is a vampire. Bella loves him so much she wants to be a vampire like him too near the end of the film.Bottom line this is a crap film. It sucks big time. The story is crap,the acting is mediocre as they are all so bland. The chemistry between Kirsten Stewart and Robert Pattinson was just painful. They just don't click like other actors do. E.g. Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves or Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper. As well as this Kirsten is just so bland. People think Emma Watson sucks well at least she has likeability in her unlike Kirsten who NEVER smiles and goes around like a moody teenager.
If you want to see Robert Pattinson in a good film watch Water For Elephants instead.3/10Avoid at all costs",2,3,6,16 June 2015
Wreck-It Ralph," If you are a lover of video games you will love this movie,if not then its not for you
","About 3 months ago me and my mom along with my brother decided to go to see Wreck It Ralph in the cinemas.The movie chronicles on a villain named Ralph voiced by Stepbrother star John C Reilly,who is celebrating his 30th anniversary as the bad guy who always breaks things and his nemesis Fix It Felix JR has to fix what Ralph breaks with his big gigantic hands,but Ralph is so sick of being treated like a villain and he wants to be treated like the good guy. Oh does THAT sound FAMILIAR e.g Megamind,Despicable Me etc. So he travels to each game to prove to the other video charcthers like Fix It Felix Jr voiced by that guy that featured in that Mariah Carey Video Touch My Body and the others who were with Ralph at the meeting about the gaming world in the beginning of the movie that he is a good guy. Ralph soon enters a world that's like Halo and meets up with a female captain voiced by Glee Star Jane Lynch called Calhoun and later meets a quirky young girl called Vanellope who is really a glitch in the ever so colorful world of Sugar Rush which is like Mario Kart Racing or is she. And of course there is also a villain who isn't know until the very end of the movie but you will be surprised who it is?So lets talk about what I like about it well first is the animation. The animation is brilliant in this movie,its colorful,its dark and the charcther design is fantastic especially on Wreck It Ralph who looks almost like Shrek's human form in Shrek 2. Also the charcthers are really cool as well and it was cool to see a cameo of Sonic The Hedgehog in the beginning of the film. Now to the bad of this movie and I have to say the story and the voice acting. Don't get me wrong I do like the story but it started off great and then it went down hill and the voice acting I hated the voice actor who voiced Vanellope Sarah Silverman,I dunno why but she didn't really sound that great at all they should have had someone with a sweet voice doing her like Mandy Moore or Anne Hathaway for example. She just sounded like someone on crack to me. Another thing is that for Disney's 52nd animated feature after Disney's 51st Winnie The Pooh and Disney's golden age flick Tangled,it didn't feel like a Disney movie to me at all,IN FACT it looked more like a film that Pixar would make. Also I think Brave should have been Disney's 52nd and not this movie but hey that's my opinion. In my honest opinion I did enjoy this movie but my mom and my brother hated it so much,even my brother got scared at the Halo scene cause it was too dark and creepy. But in saying that I prefer Disney's 50th over Disney's 52nd maybe I wasn't the target audience for this movie,but in my opinion i'd watch it a few more times and that would be it.For me I'm giving it a 6 out of 10.",6,1,3,2 May 2013
The Princess Bride," An enjoyable FAIRYTALE
","The Princess Bride is a cult classic that came out in 1987 and stars Cary Elwes and Robin Wright and tells the story of a farmboy named Westley and a princess named Buttercup who fall in love with each other but a Prince played by Chris Sarandon) wants to marry her which leads to both Buttercup and Westley to be apart from each other until a few years later when he goes incognito as a pirate boy(like Zorro) and saves Buttercup.Will Westley save her ? Overall this film knows exactly that it's a silly fairy tale with swashbuckling rogues, princesses, evil dwellers all the charcthers that you see in a fairy tale movie. Funny thing thought is that the story is been told by an elderly man played by Peter Falk to his grandson played by Fred Savage. The film is so popular it even got spoofed in Deadpool 2 with Fred Savage reprising his role who is held hostage by Deadpool. Even Ella Enchanted is quite similar too.If you are looking for a feel good fairy tale then do check this one out. Keep an eye out for Billy Crystal who is unreconisable under prosthetics along with Carol Kane.8/10",8,0,1,16 March 2019
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Gotta be honest here but HTTYD 2 is WAY better than Frozen
","HTTYD 2 is a sequel to the 2010 smash hit of the same name based on a novel and tells the story of Hiccup who is now 20 years old who is best friends with Toothless whom he met in the 1st movie as his father at first hated dragons but later loved them in the first one. This time however Hiccup and Toothless have to face Draco a dragon slayer who wants all the dragons for himself,and Hiccup and his co have to battle it out to defeat him. But Hiccup of course is shocked to discover that his mother is still alive and well and like Hiccup is also a dragon trainer just like him. But can Hiccup save mankind and protect Toothless from Draco? and will Hiccup's family reconcile?.Overall just like the first one this one was flaming brilliant. The effects were brilliant,the animation was flawless to look at,the voice acting is supherb and the action sequences are brilliant. There was one scene however that had me weeping during the climax scene,if you seen it you know what im talking about.So it comes to my conclusion that this is the best film of 2014,while Frozen was the best of 2013 even though like I said HTTYD 2 is better than Frozen. SO kudos to Dreamworks since its their 20th anniversary and the first time to see 20th Century Fox combining with HTTYD as The Croods was the first to be in partnership with 20th Century Fox.From beginning to end I was on the edge of my seat while watching this online as I was going to see it in the cinemas tomorrow but its on too late and I was unable to see it in the big screen. Who knows I might watch it again in the cinemas and looking forward to buying this on DVD when it comes out in October.10/10",10,17,29,3 July 2014
Revolutionary Road," More like an alternative universe for Rose and Jack Dawson Titanic 2 minus the shipwreck
","So this was on TV last night and it wasn't a bad film. It stars Kate Winslet and Leonardo Di Caprio both starred in my favourite live action movie of all time Titanic. Here they play a 1950's couple who aren't happy together as they fight and argue and April(Winslet)gets pregnant and Frank(Caprio) is both shocked and doesn't want it and April gets mad at him and he doesn't want her to get rid of the baby and yeah you can sorta tell what is gonna happen after this.The story wasn't bad,the acting was great,Winslet was great as April,while Leonardo was good as Frank. If you love old fashioned movies than check it out.Overall its a 5 out of 10 for me. Nowhere good as Titanic but not that bad.",5,1,1,14 July 2014
The Little Mermaid," My all time favourite childhood movie since I was a kid
","When I was a little girl I loved mermaids and fairy tales. I was so fascinated with this movie as a kid and here is why.The Little Mermaid is directed by John Musker & Ron Clement who also directed Aladdin and most recent The Princess & the Frog. The story is about a 16 year old mermaid who is best friends with a fish named Flounder and a funny crab called Sebastian. Ariel is a very lovestruck/optimistic girl who dreams of being part of the human world. Her father doesn't want that as he has something against humans and thinks that they are barbarians. One evening Ariel hears fireworks which is the Prince's ship and as she sees him she begins to fall in love with him despite the fact she knows nothing about him. So when she goes to the sea witch she turns her into a human for 3 days,problem is she can't talk as she gives up her singing/speaking voice to Ursula(who is the villianess in this movie). Packed with great music and a nice story not to mention the colourful charcthers, The Little Mermaid will always be an instant classic in my heart as I grew up watching it in the late 90's. I recommend this to all the Disney lovers out there.10/10 for me as I loved it so much,i've got the merchandise(well I used to have an Ariel doll but she broke)and I will always love it.",10,2,2,21 September 2010
Avengers: Infinity War," Too much going on. Overrated
","OK I loved the sequel Age Of Ultron as it focused more on the avengers themselves but I will get into the negatives later. Avengers Infinity War is the prequel to the 2015 film and tells the story of the avengers who are no longer working together and must try and defeat a giant monster human called Thanos who wants the stones called the infinity stones. Each one makes Thano more powerful and it's up to the team to somewhat get back together and join the guardians of the galaxy(chris Pratt, Zoe salvada). Will they stop Thano?The special effects are very good along with the cinematography. However I didn't find it any good. The downside of it was that there was too much going on and I was so dissapointed with the hulk played by Mark Ruffalo as you never see him as the hulk at all this time. Jermery Renner who played hawkeye was absent in this and the film was so hard to follow e.g what happened to Thor's eye. I felt like it was skipping or whatever. Overall do yourselves a favour and watch the 2015 version instead.",2,148,350,6 May 2018
Get Out," Not bad but very overhyped
",Get out is a thriller horror film and tells the tale of a African American man named Chris who travels with his white girlfriend to see her parents. But when Chris sees his girlfriend's parents their behaviour is very odd.What have they againist African American people?Overall the suspense was very good and the acting was good. The only 2 actors I knew in this film was Bradley Whitefield from Kate and Leopold and Catherine Keener from Beetlejuice.If you like these kind of movies check it out,6,1,1,24 February 2019
Aladdin," Seriously what is wrong with critics I loved this retailing
","Aladdin is the latest Disney remake based on the 1992 animated film starring the late Robin Williams. This 2019 retailing stars Will Smith, Mena Masound and Naomi Scott and follows the tale of a young man named Aladdin(Massound) who meets a young woman at the marketplace unaware that she is the Princess Jasmine in incongito(Scott)and wants to win her over. With help from a charming Genie(Will Smith),Aladdin disguises himself as a Prince. But when an evil sultan named Jafar wants the lamp,can Aladdin win the Princesses heart.Now I'm not gonna lie I was so nervous watching this film as I thought Will Smith would ruin it with his singing style and the other actors,but to my surprise along with my mom and my brother,we all loved it. Will Smith was great in this film with his comedic timing,Naomi Scott was excellent as Jasmine(And boy can she sing so good). The villian was decent I thought he was different compare to the 1992 version.The cinematography was gorgeous, the music was very good especially the new song Speechless. The costumes were stunning too.I loved how it wasn't a beat by beat of the original. For instance in the One Jump Ahead song Aladdin and Jasmine meet first thing while she is in incognito and near the end Jasmine didn't say I choose you Aladdin/call me Al.Guy Richie thank you for making this film. Would definetly put it in my top 5 favourite Disney Live Action movies of all time now.
Definetly buying this movie and may watch it in the cinemas again.9.5/10
Ps Mena Masound was handsome and likeable. His chemistry with Naomi Scott was perfect.",10,361,681,25 May 2019
The Theory of Everything," Very good movie
",The Theory of Everything is an Oscar winning movie starring Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones. It is based off a true story of the late Stephen Hawkings who died in March 2018 with Lor Gor Disease similar to motor neuron disease.The film explores from when Stephen was a brilliant physist to a man struggling with his condition where his wheelchair bounded and uses a computer to help him communicate. We also see his two wives Jane and Elaine along with his children.Eddie Redmaye was brilliant as Stephen Hawkings you swear it was really him right down to the movements in the wheelchair.If you haven't seen this film I suggest you to watch it on Netflix. It was worth seeing.,8,0,0,20 July 2019
Bolt," MAN do I love this caper
","When I first saw Bolt I wasn't into it,but when I decided to give it another shot I instantly became a fan of it. From the director and screenwriter that brought you Disney's 50th Tangled,Bolt tells the story of a dog named Bolt(voiced by Grease's John Travolta)who thinks that he has superhuman powers and that his an actual hero little does he know that its all a pack of lies and its really a TV show where his charcther is a superhero dog and he teams up with a teenager called Penny(voiced by Hannah Montana's Miley Cyrus)to defeat the man with the Green Eye. But when Penny gets kidnapped,its up to Bolt to save her from this villain,and so on his journey he meets a streetwise cat named Mittens(voiced by Susan Essimen)and a bipolar hamster called Rhino(voiced by John Walton)and the two embark on a hilarious adventure together to save Bolt's owner.The story for this movie is brilliant in fact I love animal movies some make me cry actually take that back ALL animal movies make me cry and this one was definitely another one as there was one particular scene that had me weeping but im not gonna spoil it for you all so you have to see the movie yourself.Surprisingly the voice cast was good too in fact it was weird hearing John Travolta voicing an actual dog,while some of the kid's favourite Miley Cyrus was great too. The Animation is flawless you can't complain about CGI cause its taking the world by storm so you know what if you love animal movies like me then check out this sweet charming tale about friendship and courage.Bolt gets a 9.5/10",9,1,2,15 May 2013
Frozen," The most overrated film of all time but it was a very good movie but Tangled was better(spoilers)
","So today I went to the cinema for the official opening of Disney's latest Frozen(6th Dec 2013) where I'm from in Ireland. So Frozen is Disney's second CGI fairytale after Disney's Tangled,and is their 53rd animated classic from the Disney canon. The movie is about two sisters; one who has magical powers that she controls using her hands named Elsa (voice by Enchanted star and Broadway singer Idina Menzel)who is afraid to open up to people because of the curse(which I had NO idea how she got them in the first place),while the other is a quirky beautiful red head named Anna(voiced by Forgetting Sarah Marshall star Kirsten Bell)who believes in true love and wants to marry a handsome prince(oh jeez does THAT SOUND FAMILIAR...coughs The Little Mermaid,Enchanted etc).Anna does however fall for a handsome prince named Hans Prince of the Southern Isles(voiced by and sung by Santino Fontana ANOTHER Broadway singer) who sweeps Anna off her feet and they sing a High School Musical number Love Is An Open Door. Meanwhile Anna tells Elsa she is getting hitched but Elsa doesn't want to hear of it as she is afraid that Anna is rushing into love.What Anna doesn't know however is that Elsa accidentally caused an accident involving Anna as a kid and which made Anna get her memories wiped out completely and it wasn't until the coronation when the big reveal on her powers was revealed to everyone including the duke(voiced by Alan Tudayk), which leads to Elsa runs away. So Anna goes in search of Elsa and teams up with a stocky built ice farmer named Kristoff(aka Christopher, voiced by Johnathan Groff)and accompanying him is his dog- like reindeer(who I swear acts like Maximus from Tangled)called Sven who cracks me up in this movie.They later meet a hilarious snowman called Olaf(voiced by Josh Gad from Ice Age 4)who dreams of summer. As Anna and Kristoff go in search of Anna's sister Elsa will they ever let her become free and face her fears on her powers?Now after all this talk you wanna know what I loved about the film well lets just say this OMG THIS FILM WAS actually good,its not like Tangled AT ALL compare to what people said it was and in fact its actually the best since Disney's 50th and here is why. The animation was gorgeous especially the scene where Elsa sings Let It Go as she builds an ice castle for herself. THAT scene just blew me away I was shocked by how awe-inspiring this scene was including the song which is definitely Oscar worthy. The score which is done by Christopher Beck(who did A Cinderella Story's score)was excellent. The minute the instrumental(which sounded like it was from The Lion King) started playing instead of the When You Wish Upon A Star theme for Disney I was blown away in fact I can't get it out of my head IT WAS THAT GOOD. Another thing I liked about this movie was the chemistry between the two sisters, in fact I literally got a bit teary eyed especially one scene near the end of the film where a certain charcther sacrifices their life for another charcther.I also love the following characters; Sven,Olaf,Anna,Kristoff and Elsa(Elsa you feel so bad for her and you hate her to be so isolated with herself because of her powers). SO after this brilliant set up you think it beats Tangled off my no 1 list and into my top 5 right? Well there are some problems.#1.The villain twist and the real identity of the villain in this movie was shocking.When I found out half way through the film that this person was the villain I was raging when the villain revealed him/herself. I was like what the heck Disney?#2 The songs now don't get me wrong I loved Let It Go,For The First Time In Forever and In Summer as well as Reindeer's are better than people, but the song Love Is An Open Door GOD it was so mediocre I almost felt like I was watching a High School Musical movie and the song was like sung by Vanessa Hudgens and Zac Efron,but I did have a soft spot for it. #3 The songs came out of nowhere and I felt that the movie focused on the songs rather than the actual story itself. Another flaw I had was on Elsa and her powers.Part of me was like how did she get these powers, who gave them to her,how can she stop the curse? Kristoff had no backstory either and I was praying that we'd get to know more on his past but we didn't and I was so disappointed in it.The chemistry between Anna and Kristoff wasn't as believable as Rapunzel & Eugene's in Tangled as you knew Eugene loved Rapunzel in Tangled,here it was kinda not on the same level as that because I felt that Anna's real love wasn't who he was AT ALL and she just used Kristoff as second base. But still for what it is Frozen is an outstanding Disney movie from the very beginning with the ice harvesters digging the ice from the ground with The Great Thaw song playing in the background, to the grand finale which was epic in its own rights.Probably the best Disney movie in the last 3 years for me.If you love a movie that's dramatic and serious that has less laughs watch Frozen,but if you love a good love story/swashbuckling adventure movie with excellent chemistry between the two love leads and good laughs than watch Tangled. Overall I was going to give this a 9 out of 10 but ask me in another couple of years and I might get the jest of it. But its in my 11th spot of all time fav movies.",8,1,1,6 December 2013
X-Men: The Last Stand," Not the best of the franchise but still its a lot of fun to watch
",X Men The Last Stand is the final X Men movie of the franchise before it got rebooted. This one is about a cure that could heal mutants and turn them back into normal again. Of course we find out that Jean Grey is still alive and is now evil as she killed Cyclops(James Marsden)in the first 30 minutes of this film and later Professor X(Patrick Stewart). So its up to the rest of the X Men mutants to save mankind and to stop the cure that could get rid of there powers. Bottom line there isn't really anything to say about this film. The effects are better than the first one which was so CGI. The acting is all 3 of these films are very good like I always loved Hugh Jackman. In fact his my celebrity crush. As for the rest of the actors they are all very good too. I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't much of Mystique this time around as she finally got normal as she got zapped by a gun with the cure formula inside and now she is a darked haired beauty now(Rebecca Romijn). With a new director(the man that brought you Superman Returns)and a new composer(who did How To Train Your Dragon). This one was pretty much.....OK. Not the best like I said but if you love X Men then check it out.Also surprise surprise Stan Lee makes a cameo in the beginning of the film.,6,1,2,4 September 2015
Good Will Hunting," Very good movie starring Robin Williams
","Good Will Hunting came out in 1997 and tells the story of a remarkable young man played by Matt Damon who hangs around with the wrong crowd as he came out of foster. When Will works as a janitor he does a math sum which impresses one of the teachers at the school played by Stellan Skarsgard. But when Will is up for probation after beating a guy in the yard he gets help from a physicatrist played by Robin Williams (who won an Oscar for his portrayal as Sean Maguire) who tries to talk sense with Will. But will he open up.Also starring Minnie Driver as Matt Damon 's girlfriend Skylar,Ben Affleck and Casey Affleck Good Will Hunting is definetly worth watching of you loved A Beautiful Mind.
Verdict: I really enjoyed this film. The acting was great and the music by Danny Elfman was very different compare to the music he does in his other films e.g. Edward Scissorhsnds and the Spiderman trilogy from 2002 to 2007.
Overall I recommend this film.",8,0,1,5 December 2018
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," A bland average film directed by the star of the film Ben Stiller
","I have been a fan of Ben Stiller's ever since I can remember as I have seen him in a lot of films ranging from Meet The Parents trilogy,to the Night At The Museum trilogy,even that film There's Something About Mary. So Ben directed,produced and starred in this 2013 fantasy based on a short story by James Thurber. It starts off with Stiller as Walter Mitty a man who is on a dating site and he has a crush on a girl called Cheryl(played by Kristen Wigg sporting a much darker hairdo,who happens to be a single mom to a teenage son)who happens to be working in the same company as him. Walter however isn't like your average ordinary guy because he often daydreams about being a mountain climber,or a superhero (where he saves Cheryl's dog),or where he battles with his boss(played by Leap Year's Adam Scott who acts as a jerk towards Walter). Walter of course ends up going to Iceland and Afghanistan to track down a man called Sean O'Connell (played by Sean Penn)as he looks up to Penn's charcther and travels to these places in order to track him down. So can Walter track Sean down ?Overall the cinematographic is beautiful to look at,as Iceland seems to be a very beautiful place to visit,as for the downer the story is a tad bit dull and Walter going into daydreams is pretty stupid but hey his suppose to do this as this is based off a short story about a man who daydreams about being whoever he wants to be as he hates his job.Keep an eye out for Shirley McClain as Walter's mother and a spoof of Brad Pitt's film The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button.Ben Stiller should just stick to comedies like Night At The Museum and Meet The Parents as well as that 2004 film Dodgeball which were classic Ben Stiller comedies.Overall its a 2.5/5 for me and out of 10 a 4/10",4,1,3,21 February 2015
The Lion King," Stunning visuals yet its the same story disappointing
","The Lion King is the remake of the 1994 film of the same name which was dubbed the greatest animated film of all time along with winning an Oscar for Best Song by Elton John.
I'm going to break down the pros and cons and my final verdict of the film as I don't want to break down the synopsis as its the same as the 1994 version.Pros
Excellent visuals and the voice cast is fairly good.
Seth Rogen and Bill Eishner as Timon & Pumbaa stole the entire film.
Love Beyonce's new song Spirit which can be heard in the film.
Donald Glover was great as Simba.
Cons
Same story
Pointless
Same score as the 1994 version
Mufassa's death didn't have me emotionally invested at all as like I said in my first con its the exact same as the animated one.Verdict: If you love The Lion King (as I much as I do since its my runner up film of all time)then you probably might like it,but for me I was just robbed as I wanted changes in this film e.g. change Mufassa's death scene. At least with the remakes of both Aladdin and Beauty & The Beast we did know what was going to happen but at least it wasn't using the same script and the same exact score like what this Lion King gave us. Its like they took the 1994 script and just read it out loud in a booth but without giving it emotions.

Stardust," Extremely underrated
","Stardust is a 2007 Fantasy Adventure movie starring Claire Danes,Charlie Cox,Sienna Miller, Robert De Niro and Michelle Pieffer and tells the story of a young man named Tristan(Charlie Cox) who's in love with a woman called Victoria(Sienna Miller) who already has another suitor called Humprey(played by an unreconisable Henry Cavil). In order to win Victoria's heart,Tristian goes on a quest to retrieve the fallen star as Victoria spotted it while Tristian and her were on a date.But when Tristian does go and find the star,it takes on a human form into a beautiful woman called Yvainne(Claire Danes) and at first the two don't get along but romance blossoms between them. When an evil witch(Michelle Pieffer)is looking for Yvainne,it's up to Tristian to protect her from the witch who wants her for eternal youth?Overall I really enjoyed this film as I used to have it on DVD and I bought it again as I hadn't seen it in over 10 years and had it forgotten.
The movie is very dark and the story is dark too yet I thought the acting was good and the chemistry between Charlie Cox and Claire Danes was believable.Also stars Shazam star Mark Strong as one of the heirs of Stormhold and narration from X-Men star Ian McKellan.

Shrek the Third," Not too bad but it is a rip off of the classic Disney movies.
",I got this on DVD a few years ago and surprisingly it wasn't too bad. What really bugs me about Shrek is that its a rip off of the classic Disney movies.The prequel is about Shrek and the rest of the crew and this time Shrek finds out that Fiona is pregnant and as her father dies Shrek has to find another ruler for Far Far Away. So Donkey and Puss along with Shrek go on an adventure to find the next ruler.Turns out its a nerdy teenager named Arthur(Justin Timberlake in his 1st animated role)who at first doesn't want to be the next ruler but as the movie progresses you can see that he does become a king.You can probably figure the rest of it for yourselves but its an OK movie. Not as good as the other 2 but still its a decent film. If you love Enchanted then you will love this.,7,1,2,12 November 2010
Moulin Rouge!," I hate to say it but the WORST musical EVER MADE that's too overrated
","<<< Spoilers ahead>>>GOD do I hate Moulin Rouge,why well here is why? The story is set in Paris as a man played by Ewan McGregor falls in love with Satine played by Nicole Kidman(who I swear must be related to Amy Adams I always think there alike)who is a duchess and is hiding a terrible secret(oh and you will be SHOCKED to find out what it is once we're finished)and is caught in some sort of love triangle with another guy. So McGregor's charcther poses as a duke so that he can be close to Satine. They sing songs that we ALL know by heart including all you need is love,a bunch of melodies and the nice song Come What May which was a very good original song. But my only problem with this film is the actual ending and(actually) the WHOLE THING. The songs come out of nowhere,the story is so thin,the effects are good though,but I just don't buy into it for a reason. Also like I said before the ending was so depressing and a bit of a letdown,I mean they KILLED of Nicole Kidman's charcther with a lung disease what the HELL,and we were made to believe that McGregor's charcther and Kidman's charcther were going to live happily ever after after the showcase with their song 'Come What May' in the end and before Kidman died,we were made to believe that she was going to be shot and then all of a sudden she just couldn't stop breathing and she fell off in a weakness and died peacefully in McGregor's arms in the end. SERIOUSLY!?!?! what the hell were they thinking of DOING THAT to the audience.The whole movie is just a joke and a piece of utter and complete garbage. The script is horrendous,the acting sucks,the music sucks,EVERYTHING sucks in this movie. I guess me and Doug Walker from the Nostalgia Critic aren't its cup of tea.My advice go out and rent something that's not bad like if you really love musicals go ahead and watch that timeless classic Grease at least that was good and had its OWN original songs compare to this piece of crap.1/10",1,3,6,18 May 2013
Meet Joe Black," One of the longest romantic fantasies I have ever watched. Not a bad film
","Meet Joe Black is a 1998 Romantic Fantasy Drama starring Brad Pitt,Claire Forlani and Anthony Hopkins and tells the story of a dying wealthy businessman named William Parrish(Hopkins) who gets a visit from Death(Brad Pitt)who took on the body of a man that William's daughter Susan(Forlani) met at a coffee shop. Problems arise however when Death falls for Susan yet he can't tell her of his true identity as he is only here to help her father reach the aftermath. The score is very haunting as it reminds me of a score James Horner would do(even though its Thomas Newman) that is over the score.The chemistry between Claire and Brad was good and both Brad and his co star from Legends Of The Fall(Hopkins) was great too.The only gripe I have with this film is the running time as its on for a whooping 3 hour and 6 minutes. To be fair I think it should have been on for an hour and 50 minutes as the extra 2 hours is literally about William and his business company which makes the film boring and bland. Nevertheless it was a good flick.",6,1,2,12 October 2019
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," The Amazing Spiderman 2 is actually a really good movie in fact its better than the first outing.
","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a sequel to the 2012 film of the same name and stars Andrew Garfield as the web-slinger who fights crime in New York City. This time Peter finds out more about his parents who we see in the opening credits and they are fighting some guy on an aeroplane who was posing as a pilot. We then meet Spiderman himself trying to get some Russian guy played by Paul Giamatti(who will be later known as Rhino a villain Spiderman defeats but you have to wait till the end to see him)and Peter as Spiderman is out to get him by teasing with him. But Peter is late for his graduation so he ditches Giamatti's charcther and goes to graduate along with Gwen Stacy(played by Garfield's real life girlfriend Emma Stone) who have an off/on again relationship and Peter still thinks of Gwen's father (Denis Leary)who died in the first Spiderman movie and he can't stop thinking of him,especially during the graduation scene,so he decides to break up with Gwen again but she is so stubborn she won't accept it as she says to him you have done this to me again and again and again. Later we meet a man called Max Dillion(played by former singer turned actor Jamie Foxx)who is obsessed with Spiderman,but when an accident at work causes him to turn bad he ends up being ANOTHER villain that Spiderman has to defeat called Electro who can control the electricity.Meanwhile Peter's former buddy Harry Osbourne(played by Dane DeHaan who reminds me of a younger version of Leonardo Di Caprio)'s father passes away and Harry has some sort of disease that turns him into the Green Goblin as his father apparently had this disease,and the only way to cure it is Spiderman's blood. Now I don't want to give too much away but you can tell what is gonna happen next. Overall I enjoyed this movie, in fact I was watching it on DVD as I got the DVD of it and quite frankly like I said before its better than the first movie. So is it as good as Tobey Maguire's version? well I think Andrew Garfield was very good in this movie especially this one part where a certain charcther that we love dies and I was in tears because of it(happens during the climax scene).But is it better than Spiderman 3 which had the same setup with 3 villains.......YES I really loved this movie,in fact I know its a guys film but who cares I grew up with Spiderman and I think his an awesome superhero.I didn't get the chance to see this in the cinemas but I was lucky to have watched it online.Verdict: The Amazing Spiderman 2 is a very good movie that will leave you tear eyed in the end for 2 hours and 16 minutes its worth seeing for the effects and the climax scene.Overall its a 7.5/10.",7,0,3,24 June 2014
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," A sequel to the 2008 cult movie
","Twilight Saga: New Moon is a 2009 Horror/Romance sequel of the 2008 film Twilight and this time Bella Swan and Edward Cullen (Kirsten Stewart and Robert Pattinson)are still in love but they part ways as Victoria(Racheal LaFevre) is out to get Bella. Bella gets heartbroken and of course becomes close with Jacob. So who will Bella choose in the end Edward or Jacob. I think we all know who she ends up being with in the end.
Overall this is such a boring franchise. I don't know why I'm on a binge watching every Twilight film from 2008 to 2012 but I wanted to see what each one is like and compare them.
Kirsten Stewart is so so bland. I don't know what it is about her but she's just not likeable. I can take Emma Watson any day as she has a likeabilty(unlike Stewart who has just one blooming expression and that's just staring lifeless).
Robert Pattinson isn't a bad actor. I loved him in Water For Elephants with Reese Witherspoon and he was great as Cedric in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire but by god his chemistry with Kirsten was boring. They are no compatable at all and they were dating until the Twilight Saga ended. To me this was pretty obvious a PR stunt just so people would go and watch this crap.

Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," The most underrated movies of all time
","Seriously after its lame first one,they decided to do another one and again its a pretty average flick. This time Reeds and Susan are getting married but when their wedding day is put in jeopardy over a mysterious guy who's known as the surfer the gang have to save the day yet again,and also face their arch-nemesis played by Julian McMahon Doom.If you love superheroes and your a guy who loves blown up stuff and A lot of action then check it out.The acting was great,the story was alright,The plot is the same as the first movie,and again it was OK in some parts.

But when her overprotective father doesn't want the two to fall in love(Lizzie and Peter) will they fight against all odds.Overall it was a great movie.

Coco," A very good Pixar movie
",Coco is a Pixar animated film and tells the tale of a young boy named Miguel who dreams of becoming a musician as his great grand father was a well known musician. But his aunt doesn't want him to be a singer as she wants him to be a shoemaker. Meanwhile Miguel's granny is suffering from dementia and doesn't remember much and since its the land of the dead he steals a guitar and ends up going to see the land of the dead where he meets his family again and meets another skeleton named Hector who can't be remembered as his photo went missing and Miguel asks Hector to track down Emerla De LA Cruz who is Miguel's grandfather but is De LA Cruz really Miguel's grandfather? And will Miguel pursue his dreams as a musician and reunite with the living? Overall when I first saw the trailer for this I thought it was going to be a rip off of The Book Of Life which was also about the land of the dead.....but surprisingly it wasn't. I liked the twist in this film as I did not see it coming. A I'm going to say is that a certain someone plargised another persons idea and that's all I'm gonna say. I was glad I seen this Golden Globe winner and soon to be Oscar winner today. There was a few places where I wept a bit but overall I really enjoyed it.8/10 PS the song remember me was very good.,8,0,1,4 February 2018
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Actually holds up after 26 years
","The Nightmare Before Christmas is a 1993 stop motion horror animated musical film about a skeleton named Jack Skellington who is transported to the Christmas world and plans to hatch Christmas. The animation is creepy yet really good,Danny Elfman's singing voice is great he sounds like Martin Short. Tim Burton created these charcthers and he did good. This movie is really from Touchstone Pictures but was reissued in 2006 for Walt Disney Pictures. The songs were great too e.g whats this or this is HalloweenIf you love gothic tales and since its Halloween check it out.7/10Also stars Catherine O Hara as Sally the voodoo zombie doll which happens to be Jack's love interest.",7,0,1,25 October 2019
Big Hero 6," Big Hero 6 is an awesome movie to come out this year from Walt Disney Animation Studios
","Just got back from watching Big Hero 6 and let me tell ya this film was awesome. It tells the tale of Hiro(voiced by Ryan Potter)who we see battling a man and his robot at the beginning of the movie and he of course wins the tournament. We see his brother Tadashi who rescues him and of course they get caught by the police and end up in jail,only to be bailed out by their aunt Cass(voiced by Maya Rudolph)who minds Hiro and Tadashi after the death of their parents 10 years ago so she has to mind them. Of course we later see Hiro going to college with Tadashi where we meet 4 new nerds including Honey Lemon,GoGo,Fred and Wasabi as Tadashi has created a new robot who can heal the injured called Baymax(voiced by Scot Adsit,who is the cutest thing you will ever come across in this film,I swear everyone is going to get a hold of a Baymax toy I guarantee it). But tragedy strikes however when there is a fire at the college and Tadashi goes in to try and save Professor Callaghan(who is voiced by James Cromwell from Babe) who before the tragedy was impressed with Hiro's new creation which are like magnetic bolts.However when Tadashi tries to save Professor Callaghan he gets caught in the blaze and dies tragically,leaving a heartbroken Hiro behind. So Hiro ends up with Baymax and later becomes friends with him. But when we later meet a masked villain who stole Hiro's creation,and tries to destroy everything,its up to Hiro and his new friends to defeat the masked villain and discover who is behind the mask? Could it be Professor Callaghan and wants to seek revenge on Kali who we meet during the first 15 minutes of the film?Bottom line I enjoyed this movie. The pacing is very fast so its a blink and you missed it scenario and the effects are awesome(SanFranTokyo is such an awesome place I love how they combined Tokyo and San Francisco together,to make an awesome city). The story is easy to follow as we have two brothers this time instead of two sisters like in Frozen(Disney's last classic movie),and the voice acting is brilliant,in fact I like how the voice acting isn't distracting,as in some films like let's say Tangled,you know who is behind the charchers voices,here in Big Hero 6 you don't picture someone behind a microphone so it was nice to have some new current actors that I have never heard of before like Genenis Rodriguez,Daniel Heeney and Scot Adsit(who I have never heard of before like I said).But yeah Big Hero 6 is an awesome movie,if you love Marvel(since this is based on a Marvel comic) and some fast paced action than check it out.Also stay tuned for the ending credits after the credits end,as we have a scene involving Fred and his father who you may know from somewhere. All I have to say is he is rather old and he appeared in the Spiderman movies both with Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield. And he appeared in Chuck with Zachary Levi? That's all for now9.5/10Verdict: Ladies and gentlemen may I present Disney's version of Toothless and Hiccup from How To Train Your Dragon,as Baymax and Hiro remind me so much of those two charcthers I have mentioned.",9,41,64,5 February 2015
Dumb and Dumber," Hands down my favourite comedy of all time
","Well what can I say this film had me in tears of laughter every time I see it on the TV screen. It's got madcap charcthers,silly plot,over the top humor AND its got enough laughs for the entire family. So what is it about well two men played by Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey are two dim- witted guys who have to go to Aspen to give back a suitcase belonging to a woman called Mary played by Lauren Holly,with whom Loyd(Carrey)is in love with,little does he know that she is a married woman who's husband went missing and she needs the money that's inside the suitcase to get him back. Along the way the two men end up meeting a mafia guy who has a stomach ulcer,a guy who spat on Harry's burger at the diner(Daniels is Harry btw),a cop who thought Harry and Loyd were drinking whiskey that's really urine,a cop who's undercover as a woman who got dumped,the list goes on and on. But for what its worth Dumb and Dumber maybe the best comedy of all time and quite frankly the ONLY ONE on this PLANET that makes me laugh out loud. Now the comedies that we have today suck BIG TIME and the jokes aren't even funny,in fact there overused now and the actors that are in the comedies now like Robert Downey Jr in Due Date,Bradley Cooper in The Hangover Franchise,heck even the other comedies from this decade don't live up to this film at all.All I have to say is roll on Dumb And Dumber II and hopefully it will be as funny as the original. Im giving this a 10/10 it may not suit some but if your looking for some madcap comedy and loves Jim Carrey's old school movies then check it out.",10,1,2,18 May 2013
Brave," A good film but not as good as the brilliant Tangled
","Saw this in the cinemas in 3D last year on my own and I quite enjoyed it. The story has been done to death but the film is about a girl called Merida voiced by Kelly McDonald who never gets on well with her mother Eleanor voiced by Emma Thompson from Nanny Mcphee who always tells her to behave like a princess and marry. But Merida doesn't want to find a man and she and her mother fall out. Merida then stumbles across the wisps of faith and she meets a witch voiced by Julie Waters who gives Merida a spell that could change her mother's mind. But the spell backfires as she is transformed into a bear and only has 2 days to stop it before its too late.The animation was groundbreaking and the scenery of Scotland was gorgeous but I dunno it was missing something. Maybe its because Pixar was trying to make it look like a Disney flick even though it should cause Wreck It Ralph was a real Pixar movie,Brave wasn't. Then again maybe I prefer love stories like Tangled which is my all time favourite movie. The voice acting in Brave was brilliant but the plot and the story was a bit of a knock off of Brother Bear meets Freaky Friday sorta. But for what its worth,you should definitely check it out.",6,0,3,1 May 2013
Shrek 2," This is a pure rip off of Beauty & the Beast yet its very funny
","I got this on DVD a few years ago as I love the Shrek francise as its funny,smart,takes the mickey out of a few fairy tales(like Emnchanted which is another movie I love to death)and the charcthers are engaging.The sequel is about Shrek who is now married to Fiona and they go to see the in-laws(Fiona's parents)in Far Far Away. Of course Shrek is worried because her parents doesn't like the idea that their daughter is now an ogress and is married to an ogre who is so stubborn and unkind(Beast from Beauty & the Beast anyone)?. Meanwhile a dim-witted prince named Charming(who I think is gay) was trying to save Fiona but he was too late so his mother(aka the Fairy godmother) try to sabotage Fiona's marriage to Shrek.So Fiona's dad hires Puss in Boots to kill Shrek but he of course joins the crew with Donkey & Shrek. Shrek is unhappy so he decides to turn himself into a human(a cartoon version of Mike Myers who voices Shrek),while Donkey becomes a stallion and Fiona becomes human again all thanks to some magic potion that he found in the Fairy Godmother factory while he ,Puss and Donkey were in as they spotted the factory as they were in the forest.This sequel reminds me of Beauty & the Beast because you've got an ogre who is unhappy about being an ogre as he doesn't accept who he is cause he was never human and he becomes human in this while Fiona who was always a human becomes human again and she tells Shrek that she wants what every girl wants to live happily ever after with the ogre I married and of course you can see Lumiere,Cogsworth & Mrs Potts as cameos in this movie.I always liked the story of Shrek as it was similar to Beauty & the Beast and I like the whole story to it. I hated the fourth Shrek as it was so stupid(Avoid at all costs).If you love movies where they mock other films like Enchanted(highly recommend that you should watch this one). Then you will like this film.7/10",7,0,1,12 October 2010
Avengers: Age of Ultron," I thought it was alright but you need to watch the Avengers original in order to get the jest of it.
","Today my brother and myself went to see this in the cinemas as we had all done and we decided to watch the new Avengers movie in 3D. The Avengers as you may know consists of the following heroes. Hulk,Iron Man,Scarlet Witch,Captain America and of course Thor. This time around and the gang have to defeat an evil robot that Tony Starks(Robert Downey Jr) created in the beginning of the film as we see our heroes beforehand battling army men in a forest. We are later introduced to Russian twins both played by Aaron Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen(who were both awesome may I add) and their powers were very good,especially Olsen's character who has the ability to manipulative people's minds(as she does this later on to our heroes and they can't seem to control these dreams they are getting and they later have to hide in Hawkeye's home with his wife and two kids. Of course Hulk and Scarlet Witch(Scarlet Johannson and Mark Ruffalo)have feelings for one another and as for the rest of the gang well like I said they have to battle Ultron(voiced by James Spader)who wants to destroy the avengers. So can our team of heroes battle it out to stop Ultron?Now I had no expectations to see this movie as I didn't bother with the trailers I just went in with a blind eye and left satisfied even though the pacing was all over the place and it was a blink and you miss it scenario. Sadly myself and my brother walked out 25 minutes till the finale due to other reasons but overall I thought it was a pretty good movie.Also keep an eye out for Hayley Atwell and Stellan Skarsgard who both appeared in this movie and they were last seen in Cinderella with Lily James and Richard Madden. 7/10 for the action sequences.5.2/10 for everything else.Also since this is a Marvel film Stan Lee makes a cameo.",5,6,14,1 May 2015
Hotel Transylvania," Not too bad but not so good
","Vampire movies eh. A lot of TV shows like Buffy The Vampire Slayer,Angel,The Vampire Diaries heck even movies like Dracula and Twilight all contain vampires. So the creator of Dexter Laboratory decided to direct a movie that was sorta copying this genre,and that movie is Hotel Transylvania and boy what a movie it was. The animation was good,and the voice acting was great you've got Adam Sandler,Selena Gomez,Adam Sandler's new BFF Kevin James even the woman from The Nanny Fran Drescher is in this movie. So without further ado lets dive into the story.The story has been done so many times before and its about Dracula voiced by funnyman Adam Sandler(who stars in A lot of mediocre movies BTW) who's daughter Mavis voiced by Selena Gomez is celebrating her 18th birthday and raises her on his own(oh jeez DOES THAT SOUND FAMILIAR...aka Tangled with Rapunzel being 18 and celebrating her 18th bday)as he doesn't want her to get in contact with ANY humans. Problems arise though as a human called Johnny voiced by Adam Samberg discovers the hotel of Transylvania,that Dracula built in order for his creatures to be safe from humans and falls in love with Mavis. But will Dracula approve of this and are humans REALLY that bad.So I'm gonna tell you what I like and didn't like about the movie.The Good: The animation is great and the effects are good,also I thought Adam Sandler was and I have to say this actually very good as the voice of Dracula,he speaks in a Russian accent and I liked that he interpreted a different accent for the role and was being himself as A lot of celebs just walk in and use their actual voice like in Madagascar and Megamind.Now to the bad: The ending now I know this is a HUGE SPOILER but GOD hearing Cee-Lo Green's auto tuned voice in the end was such a pain to listen to as well as the rap song Im a Monster Remix sung by Becky G and Will.I.AM who is ANOTHER artist that uses auto tune. Heck even Adam Sandler raps and GOD it was just so bad and terrible.But if you love horror films or like me a sucker for fantasy films and animated films then be my guest but this isn't a film you'd watch over and over again and praise it as being good.Its a pretty average flick.Im giving it a 5 out of 10.Also keep an eye out for a certain Twilight Reference.",5,0,1,13 May 2013
Friends with Benefits," Not bad but not the best movie i've seen.
","Synopis:Dylan and Jamie are two people who decide to have sex rather than admit that they have feeling for one another and even though they try to find new people will they ever admit that they like each other.I didn't see it all on TV as I was watching something else but the movie is about a Head Designer named Dylan(Justin Timberlake)who hires a girl called Jamie(Mila Kunis) and the two have this friends with benefits relationship where they have sex and date other people. But will they admit that they want to take their relationship as a real genuine one?Overall its an OK movie,and to be honest I prefer Justin Timberlake as a singer rather than an actor,I dunno why but his better as a musician. The ending was OK but you can smell the ending a mile away as a lot of people say its like No Strings Attached. 4/10",4,0,0,6 March 2014
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Good follow up to The Goblet of Fire
","Harry Potter And The Order of The Phoenix is a follow up to the 2005 Harry Potter film Goblet Of Fire where Harry is been bullied by his cousin's gang and Harry saves Dudley(his cousin)from these deadly shadows. Of course Harry gets nightmares about Lord Voldermort and thinks that Voldermort is out for revenge again. While his dealing with Voldermort's comeback,the rest are still grieving for Cedric(Robert Pattinson) who dies in the goblet of fire by Voldermort and Harry keeps trying to warn everyone that Voldermort is back. There is also a new teacher called Dolores Umbridge (played by Imelda Staunton from Maleficent)and she has shown hatred towards Harry and doesn't want any of the students to use violence or deadly spells.Will anyone believe Harry that Voldermort has returned? Overall i really enjoyed this one too. The acting is good and I like the par where Harry is setting up a fight for Voldermort with Hermoine Granger(Emma Watson),Ron Weasley(Rupert Grint) and Co as Harry found a secret room to prepare themselves from Voldermort,the special effects is great and overall it is a fun film to watch. 8/10",8,0,0,8 January 2018
Toy Story," The one that started it all with Pixar
","In 1995 a man named John Lasseter set up his own company called Pixar which was also owned by the late Steve Jobs. So their first film was of course Toy Story. Everyone has seen this movie before its probably the best Pixar movie to date since the mid 1990s. The story is about Woody the cowboy(voiced by Tom Hanks)who is a toy along with many other toys that come to life when no one is in the room. All of the toys are owned by Andy a young boy who lives with his mom and his sister. So on the eve of Andy's birthday he ends up getting a new toy,the Buzz Lightyear toy which is a very popular toy who is a space ranger. So when Woody is introduced to Buzz Lightyear(voiced by Tim Allen)Woody ends up being jealous of him and he would do anything to be the center of attention again. But when a rough kid who lives next door accidentally gets Woody and Buzz out of a cash rending machine its up to Woody and Buzz to escape Sid's house.Overall this was a very original authentic masterpiece. The story is very good,the music is great,the charcthers are engaging and the whole set up is fantastic. Its a shame it didn't win an Oscar but at least the 2010 prequel to it won Best Animated Feature beating the likes of Tangled and How To Train Your Dragon. 9/10",9,0,1,28 December 2015

I haven't seen this film in a very long time but what I liked about it was the special effects by Rick Baker(who also did the special effects for Nutty Professor and of course The Grinch).If you like Sci Fi movies and Will Smith then check it out.6.1/10Edited 12th June 2019",7,0,0,23 January 2016
Puss in Boots," Pros good animation and I love cats and the cons plot is poor and charcthers aren't memorable
","I seen this two years ago in the cinemas with my mom and my little brother. It was my 2nd movie to see that year in 2011 my first was to see Tangled which was brilliant. Puss in Boots is a spin off from the Shrek Franchise that we grew to love and to cherish when it first came out back in 2001 and finished in 2010. So when I found out that the cat from Shrek 2 got his own spin-off I was excited because I loved Antonio Banderas performance in that movie so was this movie worth every penny and the long anticipated wait??...........well let's find out.Puss is an outlaw who was best friends with Humpedity Dumpy(voiced by Zach Galifankis from The Hangover you know the big built guy with the dark beard and the curly hair looks like he could be related to John Goodman yeah him)who he betrayals years ago as Dumpy stole money from the bank but before that Puss explains his background and judging by him his a very smooth talking charming charismatic cat who's a bit of a heartthrob except his a cat that looks like Zorro(yeah I spotted the Zorro homage as Antonio Banderas played him in 1997 with Catherine Zeta Jones). Meanwhile another cat thief named Kitty Soft paws(voiced by Salma Hayek)is out to steal the magic beans(that are belonging to Jack and Jill voiced by Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Seadris) and to find the golden eggs belonging to the golden goose and Puss lost to her but he decides to team up with her and finds out that his former buddy(who I mentioned before) go off in search of the golden eggs.So after this set up you think that this is the best movie of all time and is in my top 5 or 10 right?? well there are some problems with this movie.#1 Is the story yes I know I loved Puss in the sequel to Shrek back in 2004 and I'm a lover for cats but is it just me or did the story drag on and on and on to any of you people.#2 The charcthers were good but not as memorable as they were in Shrek or the brilliant 2010 Dream works flick How To Train Your Dragon.They were all boring and dull and if I had to pick a favorite I would go with Puss and Kitty. Humpedity wasn't my cup of tea,he was So annoying and so irritating I didn't like him AT ALL.#3 The pacing was so quick and it didn't give me a chance to look at the scenes right. Yeah like in Tangled was the same but still that was A lot more memorable than this film.Overall did I like Puss in Boots sure it was a good flick but to be honest i'd rather watch some other cartoon than this. Like its nothing to write home about.SO overall I'm giving it a 6 out of 10 A 3 out of 5 stars for me.",6,1,2,25 June 2013
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Jim Carrey in a film where his not over the top
","Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind is a 2004 sci fi film featuring an all star cast ranging from Jim Carrey to Mark Ruffalo to even Kirsten Dunst and Kate Winslet. Movie tells the story of a timid man named Joel(Carrey) who meets a quirky woman on a train named Clematine(Kate Winslet sporting coloured hair)and they start a relationship,but when Clematine goes through a procedure where she erases Joel from her mind,Joel does the exact same thing.
Seeing Jim Carrey in a film where he plays a normal shy bloke not doing silly faces was interesting. I guess Jim wanted to be in a film where it isn't a comedy and wanted to prove to Hollywood that he isn't a typecast actor.Kate Winslet was quite quirky in this film and it was funny seeing Mark Ruffalo and Kirsten Dunst in cameo roles as doctors who work at the clinic where Clemaintine got rid of her memories of Joel.If you are a fan of Carrey and you want to see that his not some zany person then its definitely worth a watch.",7,0,0,30 November 2019
Avatar," The effects were brilliant but the story was pretty average and complicated
","Remember the 1995 flick Pocahontas where a native American princess named Pocahontas falls for an English Sea Captain and that 2010 live- action flick from Columbia Pictures The Smurfs,well what if you put these two movies into a blended machine and make it into a sci-fi flick set in 2030 or whatever,well that's what James Cameron the director of Titanic did in this highly overrated flick.The movie is about a disabled marine played by Sam Worrington who goes undercover as an Avatar to find out some secrets and to protect the land Pandora. Along with a scientist played by Signorary Weaver and Joey David Moore the two team up with Jake(Worrington)and they are each assigned to go into a sun like bed that transports their minds into their cloned Avatar bodies. But when Jake is enjoying his freedom as he can move like an ordinary human,he falls in love with Na'vi played by Zoe Saldana from Star Trek little does she know that the Avatar is really a disabled marine in disguise. The Good: The effects to Avatar is brilliant they deserve a 10/10 for me because I love how it transports you to another dimension and the way the actors move in their CGI Avatar bodies is really cool.Now to the bad: The Story and GOD this movie is on for 3 hours long and it sometimes drags on too much also its a very complicated movie because it never explains to the audience what happened to Jake's condition,was he born to be paralysis-ed,what happened to him and what happened to his brother did he die after saving his country its just so slow paced.Overall though i've only seen this movie 3 times already and its only good for the effects the rest just drags on and on and on.Im giving it a 7/10",7,0,0,13 May 2013

","Toy Story 2 picks off where Toy Story ended and this time Woody ends up going missing as a toy collector(voiced by Wayne Knight from Tarzan and Rat Race) ends up stealing Woody who was in the yards sale trying to save Weezy the penguin who ends up going up for sale at the yard sale and the toy collector keeps Woody who is a fan of Woody's Round Up as he collected a lot of merchandise for it including Woody's horse Bullseye,Woody's love interest Jessie(voiced by Joan Cusack) and the villain in this film (voiced by Kelsey Grammar). So will Buzz and the team save Woody from the toy collector and get Woody back before Andy notices his missing?Overall this one was just as good as the original one. I liked how they had A lot of Star Wars nods tot this film like the evil emperor who is obviously a nod to Darth Vader who happens to be Buzz Lightyear's father,the aliens from the first movie the list goes on.Also the music in this film is also very good,especially the tearjearking ballad When She Loves Me by Sarah McLaughin who also did the song for City Of Angel's In The Arms Of An Angel.Worth watching",9,0,1,28 December 2015
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," The final movie of the Twilight Saga
","Breaking Dawn part 2 is the 2nd part of the 2011 film from the Twilight Saga and the final in the series franchise. This time Bella came back to life as a Vampire(as spoiler alert she died in the part 1 of breaking dawn after giving birth to Remenesse(Mackenzie Foy from The Nutcracker And The Four Realms) and an evil vampire(Micheal Sheen) wants to take the Cullens down. But can they defeat him and protect Remenesse?Overall this was better than the other 3 and if you are a fan of the franchise than you may like this.The final battle scene really browns me off as (spoiler) it was all a vision.Keep an eye out for a then unknown Rami Malak.Warning
And prepare to watch people being beheaded in this film.",5,0,1,3 February 2019
There's Something About Mary," From the directors of my favourite comedy of all time comes this hilarious romantic comedy
","There's Something About Mary is 1998 romantic comedy directed by the Farrrelly Brothers and stars Ben Stiller,Cameron Diaz,Matt Dillon and Lee Evans and tells the tale of a young lovelorn man named Ted(played by Ben Stiller)who is still not over his first love Mary(played by Cameron Diaz).As a teen his prom night went horribly wrong and he lost touch of Mary when he got older. Now grown up he tries to track her down by hiring a Private Detective played by Matt Dillon who also falls madly in love with Mary along with a couple of more guys and Ted has to wonder will he ever be with Mary or not?
Overall from start to finish this film was hilarious. The opening with Ben Stiller wearing braces and getting his privates caught in his zipper of the trousers cracked me up and Keith David(who plays Cameron Diaz's stepdad in this film) with his reaction to it was hilarious. Another was about the dog who took a sleeping pill and the Private Detective had to try and bring him back to life again. The chemistry between Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz was very well played as I love both actors having grown up watching these two evolve(I think this film introduced me to Ben Stiller,while The Mask was the film that introduced me to her as that was her film debut with Jim Carrey in 1994).Now I know what your saying is it as funny as Dumb & Dumber.....not quite but it does come in a close second to that film.

La La Land," A triumph of Film Making for todays generation
","Today I went to see the new movie La La Land which is getting a serious of amount of praise for literally everything so I decided to go and see is this film worth the hype that critics are calling a dazzling masterpiece.The Notebook star Ryan Gosling teams up with The Amazing Spiderman's Emma Stone in this engaging imaginative musical drama set in modern LA where a young woman named Mia(Stone)dreams of making it big on stage. She auditions for roles for different shows but never gets any call back. We later meet Sebastian(Gosling)who is an inspiring jazz musician who wants to make it big in music and wants to open up his own jazz club. At first when Seb and Mia meet on the motorway going doing their every day stuff the two don't see eye to eye but when they meet again they later start to like each other and they sing and dance along the way. The Visuals in this film are absolutely amazing its a real feast for your eyes when you see the visuals in this movie. The acting is top notch. I loved Ryan Gosling since The Notebook(quite dreamy to look at too),while Emma Stone is another actress I adore. Their singing was amazing especially Ryan's his got this Micheal Buble/Harry Connick Jr vibe about him with Gene Kelly's dancing skills. Emma Stone was brilliant too with her singing skills she was a real 1940s/modern day woman who wants to dream big and is rather negative when it comes to auditioning. Also starring John Legend,J.K Simmons this film is definitely the one to hear winning Best Picture at the Oscars in 2017. Best bit: The visuals were stunning,singing was wonderful and the story is like going back in time when Musicals were big in the day. Acting is brilliant especially from two leads.Worst Bit: The ending was a bit of a let down(if you seen the film you know what im on about ,but still I liked the what if scenario).If you are a die hard fan of old school musicals,Emma Stone or Ryan Gosling then this is for you. I loved the song City Of Stars sung by Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.One to definitely buy on Blu-Ray or DVD when it comes out.9/105/5",9,3,8,14 January 2017
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Hilarious sequel to the 1990 Christmas hit
",Home Alone II tells the story of Kevin(Macaulay Culkin)and his family and this time his family are heading to Florida for the Xmas season but Kevin ends up getting lost and he spots a man who he thinks his father but isn't and he winds up in New York City aka The Big Apple where he later meets his criminal friends again and let me tell ya there is more chaos to bring them back to jail again.Like the first one this is really funny and heartwarming. Macaulay Culkin is funnier than ever and I love how he causes chaos with the two bad boys and in one scene Kevin throws paint cans at them and even sets the same burglar's head on fire again.Overall its as good as the first one and you should check it out.,8,0,0,15 December 2013
Up," At first I actually hated this movie but now I actually really like this film.
","Up is a Oscar winning animated film from Pixar that tells the story of an elderly man who whisks his house away by using balloons and goes to the falls where his deceased wife wanted to go. Along the journey he teams up with a scout named Russell,a dog named Dug and a peacock and together they go off on an adventure. The animation in this film is very well done and the first 10 minutes of this film is very sentimental where we see Carl(Ed Asher from Elf)who meets his future wife who was a real tomboy and we as the audience get to see them growing up to actually falling in love to actually growing old together. That was just genius the way the filmmakers did this. Also the story is very good too and if you haven't seen this movie I strongly recommend it. When I first seen this film first I actually despise it because it felt rather boring and just too overrated for my likings. But when I finally seen it again another few times I actually changed my mind on it and ended up liking the film.",8,0,1,4 January 2016
Rio," Actually I enjoyed this movie
","Rio is a computer animated movie brought to you by 20th Century Fox and Blue Sky Studios and tells the story about a blue macaw voiced by Jesse Eisenberg who gets adopted by a nerdy girl voiced by Leslie Mann who along with a scientist, wants her macaw to go to Rio to mate another one of his kind. So they travel to Rio where our male macaw meets Jewel voiced by Anne Hathaway(who actually sings in this movie too may I add its a musical so you'll be expecting a lot of fun loving,tap dancing songs in this movie which are SO forgettable by the way)a sassy macaw who escapes with the male macaw and together they meet up with a hipster cock and a cool yellow chick (voiced by auto tune man himself Will.I.Am and the yellow chick is voiced by ex Rn B singer turned actor Jamie Foxx). But an evil bird named Nigel voiced by Jermaine Clements is after them.Bottom line it was a cute flick,is it epic NO,are the songs good,well some of them are but Nigel's song MAN was that so embarrassing it reminded me of that rapping dog in that god awful film Titanic Legend Goes On,is the voice acting great,sure I guess even though you Will.I.Am's voice a MILE away as for Anne Hathaway,the animation I must say was brilliant but still if you love animal movies and musicals then check it out.Song: 5/10 Animation 8.5/10 Story: 7.5/10 Cast:8.5/10Overall im giving Rio a 7/10 out of 5 stars a 3 out of 5.",7,0,0,8 June 2013
National Treasure," An Enjoyable action flick starring Nicolas Cage
","National Treasure was released in 2004 and stars Nicolas Cage,Diane Kruger and Justin Bartha and tells the tale of a man named Benjamin Franklin Gates(Cage)who specializes in finding treasure since he is a treasure hunter.

But with a blast from Benjamin's past will he and his co mates find the missing treasure with the invisible map they found hidden under the declaration of independence?
Overall I really enjoyed this movie. I always had a soft spot for Nicolas Cage. You could say his a guilty pleasure actor for me as the guy was great in this film. The cinematography was great and the score was very good too.

How to Train Your Dragon," Definitely in my top 3 favourite movies of all time
","I had no expectations to see this film as it wasn't my cup of tea at first as I am a lover for fairytale films like Tangled,The Little Mermaid etc so when I got this for a bargain yesterday I decided to buy it and watch it last night.The story is set in medieval times and its about a boy named Hiccup who befriends a dragon named Toothless whom he met in the woods as he was tied up in ropes. Hiccup's father is a viking and he is a dragon slayer and wants his son to follow in his steps. Of course what his father doesn't know is that his son doesn't want to kill dragons as he knows more on dragons than anyone else. The film itself was quite dark and not as colorful yet it was brilliantly well done. The story was good and the animation was breathtaking I loved the scenaries in this film where Hiccup and Toothless ride of in the auora lights at night along with Hiccup's love interest Astrid voiced by America Ferrea,the voice cast was unknown yet I knew America Ferrara who was in Ugly Betty as Betty, and(Jay Bucumel who I think was in The Sorcecers Appretience with Nicolas Cage back in 2010), I knew David Tennant from Dr Who as I used to watch that TV series before Matt Smith took his place.9/10",9,0,1,27 March 2011

Overall the visuals is good,the plot is decent enough and its not the best Bradley Cooper film,you could say I am on a Bradley Cooper binge lately since he starred in A Star Is Born.
Fun fact he worked with Robert De Niro in Joy and Silver Linings Playbook.If you are a fan of Bradley Cooper than check it out",6,0,0,23 January 2019
Beauty and the Beast," If you loved the 1991 classic then be my guest,sit back and enjoy this lavish fairy tale.
","Beauty & The Beast is my 5th favorite movie of all time back in 1991 and when I heard they were going to remake this masterpiece(that was nominated for Best Picture back in 1992)I was kinda skeptic. I literally thought in my head when I heard this that Anne Hathaway,Hugh Jackman,Danny De Vito,Jack Black and Ryan Gosling were going to be it but none of them were and I was surprised by the actual cast in this 2017 version.So lets begin the review shall we. Now there maybe an odd spoiler but anyways lets start.In 17th century France a young prince(played by Night At The Museum 3 star Dan Stevens)is a selfish,cold-hearted prince who would throw lavish parties and invite everybody in. But one night however an old beggar woman comes in and offers the prince a red rose for shelter. But when the prince sniggers at the old woman she transforms into an enchantress and curses him to become a hideous creature with the red rose as his time line. The only way to break the curse is if he could love another and earn their love in return then it will break,if not he will remain this way along with his servants. Fast forward a year later and we meet our heroine Belle(played by Harry Potter star Emma Watson)who is the only odd girl in the village as she loves reading books and exploring the world as well as inventing a washing machine to wash her clothes. She catches the eye of a handsome yet arrogant man named Gaston(Luke Evans)who hears her singing and he is instantly drawn to her. But she doesn't like him and he tries to win her over. Meanwhile Belle's father Maurice(played by The Hunchback Of Notre Dame star Kevin Kline sporting a brilliant British accent)is on his way to get Belle a white rose on his trip out when he gets taken by the Beast(Stevens)who holds him as his prisoner. Belle saves him and she takes her father's place(pretty much like the original).At first Belle and the Beast don't see eye to eye as his hot-headed yet diplomatic at the same time. But as the two spend some more time together they of course fall in love. But will Gaston find and kill the Beast. And will the Beast get Belle to fall in love with him before the last petal falls.Now like I said I loved the 1991 classic of the same name and Belle is one if not my favorite Disney princess of all time. So was I intrigued by this film. The answer is YES, I absolutely loved this version of the film. The visuals were brilliant,the songs(from the original) are all in here along with three other songs How Does A Moment Last Forever,Days Of The Sun and of course my favorite song from the new song list Evermore sung by Dan Stevens. Everything about this film was beautiful and stunning to look at. Emma Watson was great as Belle yet she appears disinterested in certain scenes and her singing isn't as great as ALOT of autotune was involved. Having said that she did nail it out of the park. Dan Stevens who knew he had a great singing voice was also very good. And surprisingly the CGI on the beast was OK but it wasn't as terrible as I thought it was going to be. As for the transformation scene(yes I am going into spoiler mode here,you have been warned)is very sinister and dark. I literally cried and cried when I seen it and trust me its A lot more different than the 1991 version where the Beast gets stabbed,in this one he gets shot 3 times by Gaston. Yes folks Gaston shoots Beast 3 times and BY GOD was I on the edge of my seat.The whole gay controversy didn't bother me with Josh Gad as Lefou being gay because he was just a total dim-witted yet smart sidekick from Gaston's gang.Overall I loved this movie and Ewan McGregor was very good as Lumiere and Ian McKellan was great as Cogsworth. Alan Menken does the music for this film again so I was happy.A -9.5/105/5See it.",9,8,18,18 March 2017

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Pretty solid flick
","GOTG Vol 2 is a sequel to the 2014 movie of the same name and stars Chris Pratt,Zoe Saldana, Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper and tells the story of Starlord (played by Chris Pratt)and the gang led by a raccoon(voiced by Bradley Cooper),a tree named Groot( voiced by Vin Diesel who only says I am Groot)and an alien chick played by Zoe Saldana who all try and save the world. Problems arise however when Starlord's father Gro(Kurt Russell) enters his life again after 34 years and wants Starlord to join him. But is his father all as he appears to be?Packed with great visual effects,feel good songs and a great cast,especially Bradley Cooper who uses a New Yorker accent and not once did I say throughout the film Oh that's Bradley Cooper being Bradley Cooper. Stick to the main credits as there is 5 post credit scenes one including the late Stan Lee on the moon and Howard The Duck.GOTG returned in Infinity War with a prequel coming in 2020 and they will also appear in Avenger's Endgame.4/5",7,0,1,21 March 2019
Titanic," Hands down and quite possibly the best live action movie of all time for me
","Well what can I say you gotta love a good disaster movie set on real events and Titanic checks ALL the boxes for a good movie. Set in April 1916 the movie opens with an elderly woman named Rose(played by the late Gracie Stuart)who talks to the reporters(one played by Bill Paxton from Mighty Joe Young) and she talks to them along with her granddaughter about the story of the Titanic. So we cut in to see all the people being sent aboard the famous ship and we see a younger looking Rose(played by Kate Winslet who looks so different with her dyed red hair)and her boorish fiancée played by Billy Zane(from The Phantom)who is by her side as she sets sail on the ship. Meanwhile a charming man named Jack Dawson(played by the gorgeous Leonardo Di Caprio before he morphed into Eric Dane's love child now)as he and his mates are playing cards so his friend decides to abort the ship with him as he yells the famous line IM THE KING OF THE WORLD.But later in the film Jack falls in love with Rose while his staying on the ship and the two become really close with each other. But what will Rose's boorish egotistical fiancée think of it??.This film maybe 3 hrs long but its definitely worth it. The music by John Horner is brilliant there's this one scene I can recall where Jack and Rose are dancing to some Irish music and they had a lot to drink and their smiling and laughing at each other,THAT was just so well done. Also you gotta love the Celine Dion hit My Heart Will Go On.The story is brilliant in fact this is what REALLY happened on the Titanic and if you come across another movie that says Titanic: The Legend Goes On I suggest you avoid this one and watch this overrated flick instead of it as the animated version well if you seen it you know what its like.Also I loved the chemistry between Winslet & DiCaprio which was so realistic and genuine. Bottom line if you haven't seen it then check it out im telling you,that you won't regret it. I seen it a million times before and if I catch it again on TV at an earlier time than i'll watch it again.10/10",10,7,11,15 May 2013
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," My review of Harry Potter And The Philospher's Stone
","As a kid back in 2001 I was a huge fan of Harry Potter I thought it was really good back in the day but as time went by I noticed that the films were getting darker. The first Harry Potter film centers on Harry Potter(Daniel Radcliffe)who was left at the footsteps by Professor Dumbledore and Maggie Smith's character many years ago when Harry was just a baby as Harry's parents died and its not safe for Harry to be with Dumbledore since a charcther called he who must not be named(Voldermort)wants him dead. Years later and Harry ends up living with his aunt and uncle who treat Harry like dirt. Of course what Harry doesn't know is that his really a wizard and is sent to Hogwarts where he meets Ron Weasley(Rupert Grint) and sassy bookworm Hermoine Granger(Emma Watson in her movie debut)who become friends with Harry and complete together in the wizardry classes.Harry later meets a giant called Hagrid(Robbie Coltrane) and the two become close unaware that Hagrid actually seen Harry when he was a baby. But when a new teacher starts in Hogwarts Professor Quill(played by Ian Hart),Harry's forehead starts stinging(since he has a thunder mark on his forehead). Who is Professor Quill and is he all he seems?Overall I enjoyed this one a lot as a kid,I haven't seen it in years as I used to have it on VHS but now I own it on DVD as I got rid of the VHS many years ago. The effects are very good and the acting is solid too. Daniel Radcliffe IS Harry Potter no question about it he nailed it as Harry Potter from 2001 to 2012. Emma Watson was actually fairly good too yet you know this was her film debut as her acting was sub par. Rupert Grint was hilarious as Ron Weasley as he always acts like a scared cat and he can't stand Hermoine Granger as they have an off/on relationship Be warned though as the last 15 minutes of this may scare younger children especially when one character turns out to be 'He Who Must Not Be Named' but is possessing a character. Bottom line if you haven't seen Harry Potter try and track it down and re-watch it again as it is a very good film,B-

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Probably my favourite out of the series that I remember well
","In this installment of Harry Potter,Harry is at his 4th year where he has a crush on a girl and tries to ask her to prom,Ron gets jealous of Hermoine being in a relationship with another guy who asked Hermoine to the prom and we even get to see Robert Pattinson as Cedric who's a new character. Harry of course ends up completing a tournament where he ends up anticipating in this tournament(who didn't even sign in). The tournament involves a fire breathing dragon. Of course we get new charcthers like Cedric including actors Brendan Glesson(as Mad Eye Cow),Timothy Spall and David Tennant are all in this film. Mad Eye Moody(Gleason) is a new teacher who teaches Harry and his very peculiar towards Harry Potter. Could he be Voldermort in disguise or someone working for Voldermort(aka He Who Must Not Be Named).Overall I liked this film. It is scary towards the end and I like how we get to see Ron Weasley and Hermoine Granger are sorta starting to become more closer(even like I have mentioned Hermoine goes to the ball with someone else and she ends up being mad at Harry & Ron).The effects are great and I love the dragon scene. Robert Pattinson was great too in this film.",7,1,1,22 April 2017
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," The sequel is just as good as the original
",In the sequel to the 2001 blockbuster hit back in the day Harry and his friends(Rupert Grint & Emma Watson as Ron Weasley and Hermoine Granger)are still in Hogwarts where a new student named Tom Riddle is starting. But is Tom Riddle all he says he is. The effects are very good and I notice that this movie is just as dark as the original one. The cast is all back and also starring in this version is Kenneth Branagh(who plays a professor in this film). If you are a fan of the 2001 version than you will like this one. I liked Emma Watson since the first one so I love how her charchter Hermoine grows up so fast. Daniel Radcliffe is still good as Harry Potter. My only complaint with Harry Potter is that it gets kinda boring and every one of them is on for 2 hours and ?? minutes. The last two thirds of this film like the first is scary for younger children.,7,1,1,22 April 2017
When Harry Met Sally...," When Harry Met Sally a very underrated romantic comedy starring former America's sweetheart Meg Ryan
","I haven't seen this movie in years but I caught it recently and I had to do a review on it. The film tells the tale of two people Harry and Sally(both played by Billy Crystal from Monsters Inc,and Meg Ryan who was in Sleepless In Seattle and of course Kate & Leopold). The story chronicles on these two people who were friends for years and over the course of the film the two start to like each other more than friends when they meet up a few years later,but they are now dating other people. So will they won't they get together?. Also the film shows segments of people who fell in love and talk about what attracted them to their potential partners in the first place.Bottom line I enjoyed this movie as I am a huge fan of Meg Ryan since I was a kid and its a pity she doesn't do movies anymore as she was very good at doing romantic comedies.The chemistry between her and Billy Crystal was very good and lets not forget the fake orgasm scene where she does it at a restaurant and everyone watches in shock. And of course the ending was predictable but hey that's romantic comedies for ya. Meg was very young back when she did this movie and she went on to star in some hit movies(Sleepless In Seattle,You've Got Mail,Anastasia) and some that just didn't do that great(Kate & Leopold and I liked that film A lot).Overall I say check it out. Its a feel good romantic comedy for all you hopeless romantics out there.Good",7,1,1,4 August 2015

Iris goes to LA while Amanda goes to England. Along the way the two girls meet two different men one is called Graham(Jude Law the guy from Alfie)and Miles (Jack Black from Tropic Thunder)who is music composer.The film is suppose to be an American version of Tara Road that starred that one from Four Weddings & a Funneral with Hugh Grant(you know she used to be in a L'oreal Paris Ad yeah her)only it features 4 A-listers Cameron Diaz,Kate Winslet,Jude Law and Jack Black.If you are in the mood for a Christmas romantic comedy or if you like the actors that are in it then check it out.I actually found it OK a bit dull from time to time but still it was OK.",6,1,1,26 December 2010
Hercules," Good animated film from the House of Mouse but not the best Disney movie ever.
","Hercules was made in 1997 and Disney kinda lost its marbles a bit with this one and I'm gonna start off with the negative side first just to get it out of the way.......THE SONGS. I swear I do like I Can Go The Distance and I Won't Say I'm In Love,but the rest of the songs were just dreadful and the man who's responsible for this is ALAN MENKEN the same man that brought us Pocahontas,Beauty & The Beast,Enchanted and Tangled(which had a better score BTW). Its kinda confusing because the ending credits song was sung by Micheal Bolton(yeah that husky male singer who sings When A Man Loves A Woman)I mean what is the score suppose to represent Gospel Church Music or Pop music,cause I'm confused.Well alright enough about me bashing the songs what's the movie about well the movie is about a Greek God named Hercules(voiced first by Josh Keaton and later by Tate Donovan)who was sent to Earth by Hades and his sidekicks who are body shifters(they can literally turn themselves into humans or animals)cause Hades wants to rule the kingdom and his got a grudge against Hercules dad(voiced by Rip Thorn). Of course when Hercules grows up and becomes a hero(like Superman or Rocky)he meets a sly sarcastic woman named Meg(voiced by Broadway Singer and Actress Susan Egan)who's also very flirty,but is she for real or is she hiding something from Hercules.Bottom line I did enjoy Hercules for its animation and the charcthers were great(if I had to be honest I found Meg to be my favourite cause she was mysterious and sarcastic yet nice at the same time).One scene did have me laughing and it was when Meg said this I'm a damsel i'm in distress,I can handle this,have a nice day, that was funny.Overall is Hercules the best Disney movie ever NO its not its pretty above average,but do I like it yeah sure its a good flick,despite the fact the songs to its credit are good but some of them are just all over the place.So its a 6 from me.",6,1,3,14 August 2013

Bradley Cooper was great too as mentioned the hot headed jerk who wants to dig deep into uncovering the truth about John and Jermery. It was interesting to watch Bradley Cooper evolve from starring in romantic comedies to becoming one of the greatest actors of all time starring in A Star is Born. Isla Fisher was hilarious as Gloria as she played the quirky childish woman who's drawn to Jermery.",7,1,1,25 January 2020
Ice Age," Good movie but with terrible animation
","I have seen this movie so many times before so I had the privilege to finally get the first and second Ice Age movies on DVD recently. The story is about a grumpy mammoth named Manfried(voiced by Everybody Loves Raymond's star Ray Romano)who teams up with Sid (John Leguizamo)and Diego(voiced by Denis Leary from The Amazing Spiderman)who have to bring an abandoned baby back to his family again,as his family were attacked by Diego's pack and Diego of course had no other choice but to tag along with Manfried and Sid to get back the baby and bring Manfried to his pack to make a meal out of him.So will Manfried and Sid bring back the abandoned baby back to his father as his mother drowned when she ran from her life on Diego's pack?Bottom line I did enjoy this movie but firstly I have to talk about the animation and why I thought it was bad. It felt like the animators were so lazy they forgot to make it more realistic looking as the backgrounds look so generic its like what you see in a Barbie movie or a made for TV or straight to DVD animated film with the quality of the film. Maybe its only my opinion on it but it didn't seem as realistic as let's say Big Hero 6 or Tangled which had more realistic backgrounds than this but I guess the two I have mentioned are from Disney,while this is 20th Century Fox.Overall thought if you love Shrek,you will like this film.4/10",4,0,0,25 February 2015

But anyway moving on from that.Christina Aguilrea follows the likes of Mariah Cary(Glitter),Jessica Simpson(Employee of The Month),Britney Spears(Crossroads) and a few more stars who failed to become an actress while the likes of Justin Timberlake,Will Smith and Mandy Moore are now full time actors but out of the three Timberlake is still both an artist and an actor. Here Aguilrea plays Ali a girl who dreams of being a burlesque dancer in Los Angelus. Of course she does go there and meets Tess(Cher who I swear looks like Gothel from Tangled) who was also a burlesque dancer herself. But a drunk burlesque dancer called Nikki(played by Kristen Bell who stars in the most overrated movie of all time Frozen wearing a dark wig here)doesn't want Ali to shine on stage. But can Ali pull of the launderette outfit at the strip club where they lip synch and not sing? or will she use her own voice to blow them away with romance blossoming between her and Cam Gandent)?.So what did I think of this movie. Well its not the best movie of all time and certainly not my all time favorite movie but if you like Aguilrea than check it out. The movie also stars While You Were Sleeping's Peter Gallagher,Grey's Anatomy star Eric Dane who plays a ruthless property owner who also has the hots for Ali,Maid In Manhattan's Stanley Tucci(as Cher's Assistant) and Julianne Hough (from Safe Havan,sporting a red wig here too like Bell). Bottom line if you like Aguilrea than you'll like it.I'm only giving it a 3 because it wasn't that great but for Aguilrea I give her a thumbs up for her singing.",3,1,4,27 May 2014
Pitch Perfect 2," A fairly good movie sequel to the 2012 original of the same name
","Pitch Perfect 2 is directed by Elizabeth Banks who also produces and stars in this movie where the Bellas(formed by Brittany Snow,Anna Kendricks,Rebel Wilson and co)are hosting a show in front of President Barackk Obama and his wife Michelle when Fat Amy(Wilson)makes a show of the group and they are forced to drop out as they are now suspended and been taken over by a new German group who threatens their career. So the Bellas stumbles across a new girl played by Hailee Steinfield who wanted to audition with the Bellas since her mother(played by Kathy Segel from 8 Simple Rules)used to be a Bella herself and Steinfield wanted to make her mom proud. So will the Bellas win their status back again from the new group?Overall I really enjoyed this movie,the music segments were great,the actors did a good job,Rebel Wilson is litreally the next big thing to come out of this film she's funny entertaining and she always refers to herself as Australian(since she is an Aussie). The rest of the film is very similar to the original one and both films are very good. If you are a fan of Glee then check it out.Be sure to keep an eye out for a cameo by Snopp Dogg and David Cross.",7,0,0,22 August 2016
Ice Age: Continental Drift," Gotta love The Pirates Of The Caribbean parody in this flick.
","Alright so i've liked the Ice Age legacy since 2000 and I seen all of them. The first one was good,the second was nice,the third was alright but this one is actually not that bad. This time we've got new voice talents from Josh Gad(who can be seen later this year in the anticpated 2nd CGI Disney fairytale after Tangled,Frozen),Peter Dindage(from Underdog and played one of the dwarfs in Mirror Mirror)and the queen diva herself Ms Jennifer Lopez(Maid In Manhattan,and Monster In Law). This time the world is at risk as Scatty the squirell who's obsessed with this acorn destroys the world causing Manny,Sid and Diego to part ways with Manny's family(Queen Latifah)and end up meeting more animals as Manny and his friends try to find a way home. SO is Ice Age the best cartoon ever made,well the animation is really good but you wouldn't be talking about it non stop compare to other animated films, but this one was actually good,but I wish this is the last one because if they keep adding more you'll lose interest in it.Overall out of 5 its a 3 out of 5. Out of 10 i'll give it a 6.",6,0,1,6 October 2013
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Ladies and Gentlemen may I present the film that started it all in the Disney Company back in 1937
","A man named Walt Disney changed movie goers lives forever when he started his first film called Snow White & The Seven Dwarfs. Before this of course was Steamboat Willie(which is now used in the Walt Disney Animation Studios as its logo). Everyone knows what this film is about,a young princess named Snow White is threatened by her evil stepmother the Queen who wants her dead(cause she wants to be the fairest one of all)so Snow White hides out in a nearby cottage with her animal buddies to keep her safe and its turns out that the cottage belongs to seven dwarfs including Dopey,Bashful,Sleepy,Sneezy,Grumpy,Doc and Happy(all these are personality traits that each dwarf has). So when the dwarfs arrive on the scene Snow White explains to them that her stepmother is trying to kill her and so they help her out. But when later on in the film,when the wicked queen catches her in the cottage disguised as an old begger woman,its up to the dwarfs to save her from the evil woman.Lets face it Walt Disney wouldn't have happened only for this film. Disney today sure has changed as gone are the hand drawn films and now its all CGI films like Frozen,Big Hero 6 and of course Disney's 50th Tangled. As far as I know I think Snow White was the film that I watched as a child and now at the age of 24 I still love Disney movies to this day no matter what age I am.Good: The Animation is beautiful and the characters are engaging. The songs are memorable too especially the cute love ballad Someday My Prince Will Come.Bad: Snow White is a really irritating character. She has this piercing voice that drives you mad it even gets worse when she sings. Also does anyone of you notice that Snow White,Aurora and Cinderella all have one thing in common........there princes. I swear Snow White's prince is so bland,so boring his just not that great at all and it was a shame that Snow White hadn't got any screen-time with him except for the I'm Wishing song. Also the ending is a bit weird,like why was the castle up in heaven for anyway?But still having said this I truly loved this movie. Is it the best animated film(well its a yes and no answer for me cause like I said without Snow White we wouldn't have DisneyLand or Euro Disney or anything Disney and our lives well wouldn't be as engaging without the man himself who died in 1966 and now its over by John Lasseter(the man responsible for Pixar in 1995) who changed Walt Disney Pictures to just Disney.8.6/10 B-",8,1,2,31 May 2015
The Lion King," My second favourite movie of all time after Tangled
","What can I say I love The Lion King. From the opening scenes of the sunrise of the African Plains, to the ending this film is brilliant. The story is about a young cub named Simba who's next in line to be King of Pride Rock after his father.But tragically his father gets killed by stampedes by his father's evil brother Scar (voiced by Jeremy Irons)who wants to take over as King Of Pride Rock. Simba runs away only to meet up with two hilarious sidekicks Timon and Pumbaa. They of course tell Simba that his got to put the past behind him and move on with life. As he gets older(now voiced by Matthew Broderick) he meets with his former friend Nala(voiced by Moira Kelly)who is shocked to discover that Simba is next in line to become King.Overall what do I think of this movie well at the age of 22 this movie NEVER fails to make me cry(this was the first ever Disney movie in history to make me cry,the second is Tangled which is hands down my all time favourite movie ever) and to this day TLK never gets old even though its 17 years old its still to this day my 2nd favourite movie of all time. Beautiful Animation,excellent voice cast,brilliant story(even though some people say its a rip off of Hamlet,yeah who gives a hoot). Overall im giving this a solid 10/10",10,0,0,22 June 2013
Inception," One of those films where you only see it once
","Inception is an Academy Award winning movie starring Leonardo Di Caprio,Ellen Page,Tom Hardy,Joseph Gordon Levitt and Micheal Caine and tells the tale of a man named Cobbs (DiCaprio)who is a skilled thief who can enter into one's mind and gain information with each dream that he is in along with his co buddies(Levitt,Page and Hardy). But each dream may cost them their lives. Will they get what they are looking for in the end?
The real star of this movie is the special effects which are very good as it is the sort of effects that would be spectacular in 3D. The acting was great too and the story is good but is the sort that you need to pay close attention too and not leave your eyes off the screen or you will be saying to yourself,what on earth am I watching here.If you are looking for a film that is confusing,mind-boggling or like me a fan of Leonardo Di Caprio then do check it out. For me I wouldn't be bothered watching it again.6/10OK",6,0,3,21 January 2019
Murder on the Orient Express," Actually very good from the man that brought you Cinderella
","Murder on the Orient Express is directed by Kenneth Branagh(who also produced and starred in this film) alongside an all star cast with Johnny Depp,Josh Gad,Michelle Phiefer,Daisy Ridley,Willem Defoe and Judi Dench and tells the tale of Hercule Pirot(Branagh sporting a French accent) who happens to be a detective and is on a case to solve an unsuspected murder on the Orient Express which revolves around Johnny Depp and its up to Pirot to find out who is the person that killed Depp's characther and why?. With outstanding cinematography done by the same man who did Cinderella,and a great score done by Patrick Doyle(again did Cinderella with Kenneth Branagh who also directed Cinderella). This film was actually very good. My main grip is the twist in the end which I can't say but all I have to say is that the audience will be surprised by how many were involved with the murder case.8/10",8,6,18,5 November 2017
The Secret Life of Pets," Just back from seeing this movie. Actually it was good
","The Secret Life Of Pets stars Louis C.K,Eric Stonestreet and Jennie Slater and tells the tale of a dog called Max who lives in NYC with his owner Katie. But when Katie gets a new dog called Duke,Max gets jealous of Duke and tries to get rid of him causing the pair to get lost in New York City. So they team up with a wise-cracking bunny voiced by Kevin Hart and his crew and the two dogs try to find their way back home in time before Katie comes back. SO will Max and Duke find their way back.Parts of this film reminded me of Garfield meets Bolt with a hint of Toy Story involved as the whole premise is what do your pets do at home while the owner goes out of their homes.It was overall a very funny tale and myself and my family all loved it today as we seen in in 3D. Kevin Hart was funny as the bunny rabbit and Jennie Slater(who was the voice of the sheep in Zootopia)was funny as Max's love interest.If you are a dog or cat lover and you love animated films. Then check it out.7.5/10B+Verdict: Not original but it was a solid film nonetheless.",7,7,15,26 June 2016
WALL·E," The most depressing film of all time
",This was on TV last night and I never even heard of it before so I decided to check it out last night. I absolutely hated it and here is why. I saw the 1st 30 mins of this film and I was so bored I could fall asleep half way through. Its basically about a robot who works in a scrapyard in (I think by the looks if it)New York. He falls for a robot named Eve and he is obsessed with some film called Funny girl(you know the one with Barbara Stresland and Walter Mattheu and Micheal Crawford from that old TV sitcom Some mothers do have em. The film had no dialouge like Sleeping Beauty which was dreadful too and I cannot believe that this heap of junk won an Oscar(what is wrong with you people) and 45 awards from other film companies. I never liked Pixar except Toy Story was good but I rather watch the 1990s Disney movies or Enchanted which I loved than this pile of garbage. This should have won worst picture as it was dreadful.1/10,1,7,34,2 January 2011
Finding Dory," My family loved it
","Finding Dory is a sequel to the 2003 hit film Finding Nemo only this time its Dory's story that we get to witness instead of Nemo's(who is now voiced by a different actor since the other actor that voiced him was too old for the part).The story shows Dory having flashbacks about her family(voiced by Diane Keaton and Eugene Levy) and she ends up getting lost. Problem is she suffers from Short Term Memory Loss and can't remember a thing about her family. Fast forward a few years later and Dory(DeGeneres)and her friends Nemo and Marlin,takes part in a school talk about families and Dory figures that she had a family also. But when she goes up ashore(like Nemo in the first movie)she ends up getting taken away by marine biologists and its up to Marlin and Nemo to rescue her again. While she is there at the marine exhibit voiced by Signovery Weaver she teams up with an octopus called Hank(voiced by Ed O Neill) and she later meets a shark called Destiny(who she was friends with since she was a little tadpole). So the question though is this; will Dory find her family again and discover who she really is.The animation was very good and the plot is very familiar to the 2003 version as we see a scene that happened in Finding Nemo and the movie gets very predictable during the 3rd act of the film but still it was very good. Ellen DeGeneres was very good as Dory as she has this humor that is very witty and charming at the same time. For some strange odd reason she reminds me of Meg Ryan in a way as both of them have the same features and they have that same humor.There is also some new characters that I have mentioned that are hilarious especially the whale with the bottle-head and Hank who was very funny.In my honest opinion this is one of my favorite movies of this year next to The Jungle Book and Zootopia,probably in my top 5 list of movies I have seen in 2016. Idris Elba, Diane Keaton and Eugene Levy if you loved the first movie then you should check it out. All my family loved it.Keep an eye out for a very cute short called Piper which tells the story of a cute bird who is afraid of the water. Verdict: Pixar has done it again. Well done.",9,1,8,31 July 2016
The Blind Side," Hands down one of my all time favourite movies with the Brilliant Sandra Bullock in the mix
","OK i've been a huge fan of Sandra Bullock since I seen her in the likes of Speed, Practical Magic,Miss Congeniality and so many more so I had the absolute delight to see her here in this truly moving motion picture. Winner of Best Actress at the Oscars back in 2009 the movie is based on a true story about a man named Micheal Oar who was later brought off by Social Workers from his cracked addict mother along with his brother as it was unsafe for himself and his brother to stay their with her.Fast forward a few years later and Micheal has moved on with his troubled past and is living with a man who helped him get into some sort of Catholic school,but he later tragically died and Micheal has no where else to go as he always runs away from his foster family. Enter Leanne Tuohy played by the brilliant Sandra Bullock who's children Collins and her son Sean Jr attend the same school as Micheal goes to.Micheal of course is struggling with his homework and the teachers sorta give him a hard time as they think that's dumb but his actually not dumb at all. Being such a headstrong housewife she stumbles across him walking in the rain and heading back to the Gym,she demands Micheal where his going and he says to the Gym,but she refuses a No from him and decides for him to stay with her and her doting husband Sean played by former Country Western Singer Tim Mcgraw who I must admit was barely recognizable without his hat and his beard.With Leanne's help Micheal soon becomes an international American Football Player for his school and fights for winning.SO why is this my all time favourite live action movie,well its because of the story I absolutely love the story to this as it moves you and you can sorta root for the charcthers. Sandra Bullock was brilliant as Leanne Tuohy even though she looked hardly noticeable because of her blonde hair which sorta looks alright on her,as for the rest of the cast there brilliant too including Quinton Aaron who is a newcomer as he plays the American Football Player Micheal Oar. The editing was great I see absolutely nothing wrong with this film its one of those movies where you can watch over and over again. Tangled,and A Walk To Remember are also my all time favourite movies so its a privilege to add The Blind Side to my list of all time favourite movies. A lot of people love that film The Shawshank Redemption but for me nah its not my cup of tea but The Blind Side is a brilliant movie.10/10",10,0,2,8 May 2013
The Shawshank Redemption," The most overrated hyped up movie I have ever watched but its good.
","I cannot believe that it took me 17 years to see this movie and was it worth the wait well here's what the film is about.The story is about a young banker played by Tim Robbins who was convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to life in Shawnshank prison where he meets a former crook named Reed played by the brilliant actor of our generation Morgan Freeman. The two become inseparable as they deal with prison life and the guards betting the HELL out of some of the prisoners; one got killed to death by the guard while the other hanged himself to death.Everyday they have to dig up holes and eating disgusting food, but will Andy(aka Robbins)ever get out of prison and did he really kill his wife and her lover in cold-blood?Bottom line is this; I'm 22 years of age a female who hates watching these kind of movies as there really not my cup of tea,I'm sort of a romantic/fantasy/cartoon/drama/weepie kind of chick and I hate watching violent movies,but this movie was really good;but seriously is it the best movie in the world? well for me its not in fact its all about dealing with prison life and the whole motto is get busy or die trying. Overall I did enjoy this movie but I wouldn't be watching it again. Once is enough for me.SO I'm giving it a 7.5/10",7,0,1,29 June 2013
Rango," Am I the only person here who actually didn't like this movie
","So it was on TV last night on RTE ONE as the Big Big Movie and since I am a lover for animated movies(which are too many to put down here on this review)I decided to give this one a go. Turns out that this film is too overrated and shouldn't have won an Oscar back in 2012. I dunno maybe I'm not a Johnny Depp fan as I find him creepy in A lot of his movies,but anyway here is the review.The movie tells the tale of Rango(voiced by Johnny Depp who in fairness did a good job as the voice of him) a pet chameleon who ends up getting lost in the town of Dirt,as he gets thrown out of his owners car by mistake and meets an animal in the side of the road. Of course Rango follows the animal to a western town where Rango meets a girl (voiced by Isla Fisher from Confessions of a Shopaholic)and Rango ends up saving the town from drought.I didn't get to see the ending of this movie as I just didn't like it. I dunno why I mean the animation was great(if not too creepy for younger kids),there is A lot of adult humor in it(heck Shrek had adult humor too). But you have to be a big fan of Johnny Depp which sadly I'm not at all and you have to be interested in westerns.My advice watch Frozen,Tangled,How To Train Your Dragon or any other good CGI or hand-drawn movie instead of this one. Its too overrated like I said and they should have given it to another animated film at the 2012 Oscars.Im giving it a 3/10,because I like the animation.",3,1,2,14 September 2014
Music and Lyrics," Hilarious in the beginning but terrible everywhere else
","When this was on TV last year I decided to check it out as it starred Drew Barromore who I think is a great actress and I never saw it before so I decided to watch it. From the opening credits I was laughing so hard as it reminded me of the 80s English boy band Wham with George Micheal and Hugh Grant who is in this movie sings a parody called Pop goes my heart from a boy band that Hugh's character was in years ago.The movie is about a washed singer/songwriter who is desperate to write a song for a young singer. Problem is he hasn't a clue what to write and with the help of a young woman who waters his plants the two begin to write music and (yes folks) love blossoms between the two.What I didn't like about this film is that Hugh Grant is without a doubt the worst actor of our time. He can hardly act or sing right and his chemistry with Drew was kinda dull. Every time I watch this film I feel like I'm reliving the 1998 Rom Com The Wedding Singer which starred Drew Barromore with Adam Sandler. It had the same plot,same 80s vibe,different actors etc.If you want to watch something that will make you laugh for a bit then do watch otherwise than that I wouldn't watch it again other than the hilarious opening which had me in stitches.",3,0,2,28 October 2010
Wonder Woman," Surprisingly good
","Wonder Woman is the latest Superhero movie for the summer and stars Gal Gadot,Chris Pine and Robin Wright and tells the tale of a beautiful princess named Diana, Princess of The Amazons(Gadot)who saves mankind after she saves a pilot/spy named Steve(Pine)who accidentally finds her place. He tells her that her place is in grave danger and so Diana and Steve travel to London to save mankind and also for Diana to track down Zeus who is a powerful warrior who is tracking her down. But who is Zeus and can Diana and Steve save mankind and Diana's home place.Packed with action sequences,great acting and a stellar cast I thoroughly enjoyed this movie as I dragged my mom and my younger brother with me to see it yesterday. Gal Gadot is terrific as Wonder Woman she is a real feminist as there is a lot of feminist quotes in this film about men and we see Wonder Woman's background in the beginning from her being a baby to being a teenager. She kinda reminds me of Zena the Warrior Princess. Chris Pine was very good as Wonder Woman's love interest I always liked Chris Pine as he is a good actor and not to mention very handsome too. The villain twist though was very well done as I thought one time that the guy that was snuffling the poison in him was the bad guy but nope it was someone else. I am happy that superhero movies are bringing in more women as super heroes because it was always men that were the heroes and not the women.If you are a fan of Wonder Woman then check it out. 7/10",7,4,11,5 June 2017
Despicable Me," Not a bad film
","I saw this last night on DVD for the first time as I never seen the film. The film is about a villain who tries to steal the moon and take over the world but when three little girls(Miranda Cosgrove,Elish Fisher and Dana Gould) try to find a place to adopt so he decides to adopt them. At first he doesn't care as he only wanted them for a decoy for Victor(Jason Segal) but he suddenly realizes that being loved is important.I liked the score of this film as its done by Pharell Williams(the dude from N.E.R.D) and the story wasn't bad. Steve Carell was hilarious as he had this German accent and those minions were hilarious. It wouldn't be the best film I have seen but its worth watching if your into James Bond or any villain movies.I'll give it a 7/10",7,0,1,10 March 2011

",Marriage Story is the latest Netflix movie starring Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver and tells the tale of a young couple with a kid who are on the verge of a divorce.

Step Up," Not a bad film
","I got this on DVD a few years back as I never seen it before and I wanted to check it out as I got it for a bargain in a DVD store.The story is about a guy named Ty who is doing community service as he and his friends break into a school in NYC and he takes their place doing community service. While his there he meets a girl(Channig Tatum's real life wife Jenna Dewan) who's partner broke his ankle for a dance completion that she was going to do and together her and Ty decide to compete in the dance completion.The story was great,cool RnB/hip hop music,chemistry between real life couple Jenna & Channing was cute and the ending was had to follow but still it was a great movie for anyone who loves music and dancing.From the director that brought you The Proposal,27 Dresses and is rumored to direct a sequel to the 2007 Disney hit Enchanted (aka Anne Fletcher who does the choreography for this as well)STEP UP is a great film to watch whenever you want something that will make you wanna dance.",6,0,0,7 November 2010
Shrek," The male version of Enchanted
","Shrek is a 2001 computer animated comedy that tells the story about a grumpy ogre (MIKE MYERS)who lives in a swamp. He befriends an annoying ass named Donkey(the hilarious EDDIE MURPHY). As his place is under attack by some fairytale creatures like Snow White,The 3 little pigs and the bad wolf,Cinderella etc Shrek goes to Dulock to see the King Farquad who sents Shrek and Donkey off on an adventure to rescue a princess named Fiona(CAMERON DIAZ) who is actually an ogre. As Shrek saved Fiona from the guarded dragon and on the highest room in the tallest tower he begins to see a different side to her and you can tell what's going to happen. Every time I watch this movie I think of it as the male version of Enchanted as they both take the mickey out of other fairy tales like Snow White,Sleeping Beauty & Cinderella and they both contain hilarious sidekicks Donkey in Shrek and Edward & Pip in Enchanted. I loved Shrek since I first saw it back in 2001 and my favourite charcther would be Donkey or Fiona, Shrek comes in after that. I'll give it a 9/10.",9,0,1,21 September 2010
X-Men: First Class," Find out how it all began in this prequel
","X-Men First Class is a prequel to the original X-Men movies that tells the tale of young Charles and his friend Erik who would both become Professor X(James McAvoy) and Magneto(Micheal Fassbender)as they fight mankind and defeat an evil villain played by Kevin Bacon who has the ability to take anyone's powers. We get to see Raven (Mystique played by Jennifer Lawrence from Silver Lining's Playbook)who has the ability to shapeshift into anyone she wants and of course she was a good person before she went bad,Hank(Nicholas Hoult from About A Boy)who would go on to be the Beast who is finding a cure to stop the mutants from becoming what they are now,Lucas Till also stars in this film as a guy who can do some stuff with fire. Together these guys team up with Professor X who lost his ability later on to not walk anymore as one of his co-workers accidentally shot him in the legs.What I liked about this film was the action and special effects and it was nice to see how it all began. I was a bit disappointed that Wolverine wasn't in this movie but Hugh Jackman makes a 25 second cameo when Charles and Erik are thinking about the past and they meet Wolverine in a bar and he told them to Go F*** themselves. But then again I do prefer the original X Men with Hugh Jackman,James Marsden,Halle Berry,Ellen Page etc as they were in the original franchise. This thing of rebooting superhero movies nowadays can get pretty boring.6/10",6,0,1,1 August 2015
Fifty Shades of Grey," Horrible horrible film I would rather watch A Walk To Remember or Kate & Leopold than this piece of crap
","Warning this contains some odd spoiler.Based on the best seller book the film version is all about a shy woman named Anastasia Steele(Dakoka Johnsson)who works for a suavy businessman named Christian Grey(Jamie Dorman)who is hiding a secret. He is in fact a sex addict who has his own playroom of sexual toys and everything in relation to BDSM. YUP I am not making this up he is a sex maniac.Of course his mom is a crack addict as we later find out in the film and later he wants Anastasia to sign a contract for her to do BDSM as he performs a lot of sexual things on her. But does Christian really love Anastasia or is he just using her for BDSM.Overall this film was complete and utter torture. I may never know why it got some praise but whatever you do avoid this film at all costs. Go watch While You Were Sleeping,Kate & Leopold,A Walk To Remember,Sleepless In Seattle any other romantic film that is better than this piece of crap. The acting is rubbish,the premise is disgusting and cruel and whatever the reason this was made for I may never know.Also the ending was just stupid too and seriously why would Anastasia want to have torture on herself from a man that clearly has no interest in her and is only after her for some sex. 0/100/5PS I couldn't give this a 0 star rating as I am not allowed so I have to give it 1 star.",1,4,9,19 June 2015
The Wolverine," My review for The Wolverine
","This happened to be on Channel 4 last night and I decided to watch bits and pieces of it. The film is another attempt of Wolverine's backstory and this time the film opens in Japan where Wolverine(played by Hugh Jackman)is saving someones live from an atomic bomb and we later see Wolverine dreaming about Jean Grey(Famkee Jansen)who died in X Men 2 but was resurrected in X Men 3 Last Stand only for Wolverine to kill her in the process. He keeps getting dreams of her and is now living it rough in a cave where he meets a bear. We later see him teaming up with some Chinese girl and he tries to protect another girl's life in Japan as her life is in danger. There is also this guy who is dying apparently and the old man wants Wolverine's powers but he declines. Eventually he does lose his immortality for a bit and its up to Wolverine to retrive his powers again and save the day. Overall I found this film OK. Its not in my honest opinion as good as X Men Orgin's Wolverine as that film had a proper backstory but a lot of critics hated that film saying it was all over the place. The director of The Wolverine is of course James Mangold who also directed the romantic fantasy comedy also starring Hugh Jackman and Meg Ryan Kate & Leopold another movie that I love to watch and consider my favourite Hugh Jackman movie. Also Mangold directed Walk The Line. Hugh Jackman is Wolverine,like Micheal Keaton as Batman or Jim Carrey as The Mask,I cannot picture anybody else as Wolverine as he plays Wolverine with so much power you think that Jackman is a bad ass but in reality his the complete opposite and sometimes I wish Jackman would star in more light-hearted films like Kate & Leopold where his not stabbing people with his metal claws. But hey if you love X Men and the charcther Wolverine than check it out.Not the best in the franchise but still its an OK movie.5/10",5,2,4,29 February 2016
The Croods," Well I thought it wasn't bad from the man that brought you Lilo & Stitch and How To Train Your Dragon franchise
","As a lover for animated films like The Lion King,Tangled,How To Train Your Dragon,Frozen and so many more good animated films out there,I decided to buy The Croods on DVD yesterday for a bargain as I never seen it before and I decided to check it out. So here is my review on the film The Croods(2013)The Croods is an animated 2013 DreamWorks Animation/20th Century Fox film and tells the tale of a cave girl called Eep(voiced by The Amazing Spiderman star Emma Stone) who is sick and tired of being cooped up in a cave alongside her overprotective father called Grug(voiced by Face/Off's Nicolas Cage) and the rest of her family as her father thinks that they could die if they ever left their cave. So Eep one day escapes only to find a handsome boy called Guy(voiced by The Proposal's Ryan Reynolds making his first animated debut here,as his second animated film he did with DreamWorks was Turbo) making fire as Eep saw a light and decided to follow it which landed her to him in the first place and the two set it off. So when Eep's habitant is in danger herself and her overprotective father along with the rest of her family decide to venture out to a whole new other world. With teamwork involved will Eep and her father ever get along and will her father stop being so overprotective over his daughter?So what is good about this film well for starters the animation is brilliant,in fact the animation isn't like the likes of Frozen or Tangled as they used Photo-Realistic imagery with 2D and CGI combined together,whereas in this the backgrounds look as if its done in live action. Also the charcther design is nice too and its nice to have Alan Silvestri(who teams up with Chris Sanders who worked with him in Lilo & Stich,while Sanders directed the brilliant How To Train Your Dragon films) as the composer of this movie. Now for the bad, the story has been done to death before. The whole overprotective parent,the child or teenager who is always moaning about wanting to be free,falling in love for the first time basically teenage stuff has been done like I said SO MANY TIMES and its a bit of a cliché if you ask me,but still I enjoyed the story too. The ending was a bit of a downer as it ended kinda funny but having said that if you love Ice Age than you will love this film. For an Oscar Nominated film I give The Croods a 6/10. And out of 5 stars I give it 3 and a half out of 5 stars.Verdict: Good",6,0,0,29 August 2014
Black Panther," All I have to say is wow I'm glad I gave this film a chance
","Black Panther is a 2018 Superhero African American film featuring an all African cast and tells the tale of a young Prince named T'Challa played by Chadwick Bozeman who's father tragically dies and he takes his place as the rightful ruler of Wakanda. But when someone else(Micheal B Jordan) wants to take over can T'Challa save his people and mankind.Overall the visuals were stunning,the acting was top notch and the score was very good.I notice ALOT of similarities between this and The Lion King when I was watching this film. Overall I really enjoyed this film and is one to revisit again.Keep an eye out for Stan Lee and Buck from Captain America(end post scene).",9,1,4,5 January 2019
Bruce Almighty," The last Jim Carrey film that I found hilarious
","Bruce Almighty is a 2003 fantasy film starring J Carry and tells the tale of a news anchor named Bruce Nolan who hates god (Morgan Freeman) so much he ends up gaining God's powers to see what he can do better. At first Bruce thinks it's great as his relationship with his girlfriend Grace Connelly(Jennifer Aniston) is on the rocks and he tries to make it better, he gets revenge on Steve Carrell's charcther Evan Baxter since he gets all the attention and at the end Bruce has to wonder is getting god's powers really that important to him.. There was slot of The Mask references in this(another Jim Carrey film) ranging from the mirror scene, the whole zero to hero charcther, both films had a hilarious alleyway scene. Overall Bruce Almighty was hilarious",7,0,0,1 April 2018
The Greatest Showman," Hugh Jackman is the greatest showman ever. Excellent
","Just got back from seeing this movie and it is based on a true story about PL Brahum(played by Hugh Jackman) who wants to make it big. He was neglected as a kid with his childhood sweethearts father who treated Brahum like trash since he started off as a tailor boy. Years later and Brahum is married to his childhood sweetheart (played by Michelle Williams) and has 2 daughters. At first Brahum decides to set up a wax museum but once that failed he decides to set up a circus and put up adverts for it. People call Brahum a fraud and calls his circus gang which includes a bearded lady,a 500 pound man,a wolf man all freaks. Will Brahum show people that they are all wrong and that he isn't worthless.
This movie is clearly belonged to Hugh Jackman. I knew the man could sing and dance as he did theatre in the past like Beauty and the Beast,Oklahoma,The Boy From Oz etc and he was fantastic in this,Zac Efron from High School Musical fame plays Philip who becomes Jackman's buddy/helper for the circus and his charcther falls for a woman named Annie played by Shake It Up's Zendaya and certain people are racist because of it. The songs were great and the woman who played the bearded lady was a brilliant singer. The visuals are stunning and everyone did a great job with this film. Definetly getting this on DVD when it comes out
Bill Condon wrote the screenplay for this, having directed another Oscar Worthy flick Beauty and The Beast with Emma Watson and Dan Stevens and James Mangold(who directed Kate and Leopold, The Wolverine and Logan) acted as an executive producer for this.
All the songs were good including rewrite the stars,this is me,the greatest show etc. 
This years LA LA Land for meThumbs up4/5",10,1,3,7 January 2018
Monsters University," My review for Monsters University
","Monsters University is a prequel to the 2001 smash hit Monsters Inc and tells the tale of Mike Wasoski(voiced by Billy Crystal)who dreams of going to Monsters University and become a scarier monster. But of course when he was a little monster,his other peers tell him that he will never be a scarier monster. Fast forward a few years later and Mike goes to Monsters University where he meets up with new monsters and he gets to meet up with his soon to be partner in crime James P Sullivan(better well known as Sully)voiced by John Goodman who is a bit of a show off at first. His father was a well know scarier monster back in the day and he wants to make his family proud. Meanwhile the school mistress voiced by Helen Mirren is giving Mike a tough time as she thinks that Mike isn't good enough and shouldn't be going to this university.So will Mike prove them all wrong and to become a scarier monster in the end?Overall i thought this film was enjoyable. Is it as good as the original; well no its not as you can never beat the original movies(well except Cinderella and The Jungle Book I love the live action ones off theses cartoons).But back to Monsters University. The animation is nice,the characters are engaging and it was great to see Billy Crystal and John Goodman back as their characters again.7/10Good",7,1,2,2 January 2017
Toy Story 3," Surprisingly this is the best Pixar film I have seen in a long time
","I was never a lover for Pixar movies as they were somewhat boring to my likings so when I got the DVD of this for as a present for my brother as he like Toy Story I decided to get the loan of it off him.I liked Toy Story because its cool to see what would happen if your toys came to life when no one was around.Winner of 2 GOLDEN GLOBES TOY STORY 3 is about Woody's(TOM HANKS FROM CHARLIE WILSONS WAR) and Buzz's(TIM ALLEN FROM SANTA CLAUSE FRANCHISE)owner Andy who is all grown up and he is going to college. Of course he can't bring his toys with him so he decides to put them in the attic.But when his mother notices the black bag she thinks it garbage and so they are sent to the trash bin. They manage to escape and so they decide to go to Sunnyville which is a children's crèche where they donate unwanted toys. Woody and the gang meet new friends and Barbie(JODI BENSON FROM ENCHANTED AND SHE VOICED ARIEL IN THE LITTLE MERMAID BACK IN 1989)meets Ken(Micheal KEATON FROM HERBIE FULLY LOADED)and they meet an evil pink bear(VOICED BY TIMOTHY DALTON)who apparently thinks that children don't love toys as his previous owner lost him and she replaced the bear for another one.The toys of course are in great danger and they try to save the day as usual. Personally when I seen this movie last night on DVD I said to myself this is going to suck big time as I mentioned above that I never liked Pixar movies I mean NEVER but when I saw this film I actually liked it. I always liked Toy Story anyway and the story was touching and heartwarming especially the ending which if you wanna know Andy decides to give all his toys away to some little girl in the end and the music by RANDY NEWMAN who did the likes of THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG,MEET THE PARENTS ETC.If you want to see this film whether your a 65 year old man or woman or a 4 year old child or any age then I highly recommend this film to anyone who liked Toy Story since it debuted in 1995.FINAL VERDICT: A winner 8/10",8,1,2,18 January 2011
Space Jam," I actually liked this as a kid and I still do even though I didn't see it in a long time.
",Space Jam combines animation and live action and tells the story of a basketball player named Micheal Jordan(who plays himself here)who is on the verge of retiring. But when he gets sucked into a golf course while playing golf he ends up in the Looney Tunes world and is accompanied with Bugs Bunny who wants Micheal Jordan to play basketball with him and his other Looney Tune companions as a bunch of aliens(one voiced by Danny De Vito) who stole Micheal Jordan's teammates abilities by using a magical basketball and the aliens become bigger and stronger than the Looney Tunes. So can they win the basketball game and Jordan can go back to the real world again and give back his teammates abilities again?Overall this movie you can say its sort of a life story of Micheal Jordan's life as a basketball player as you see real life photos of him as a kid and his playing basketball with his father as a kid(played by some young actor) at the beginning of the movie before you hear the Space Jam intro. Final Verdict I really liked this movie as a kid I never seen it in a very long time so apologies for my review as I just remembered it now and I had to do a review on it. The movie has a great soundtrack from Seal to R Kelly's I believe I can fly. I liked it as a kid and if I ever got the DVD of it I will definitely buy it and watch it again.Overall im giving it a 7.,7,3,4,30 April 2014
Pitch Perfect 3," The last in the trilogy of the 2012 hit of the same name Pitch Perfect
","Pitch Perfect 3 is a prequel to the 2012 film Pitch Perfect starring Anna Kendrick,Rebel Wilson,Brittany Snow and Anna Camp and this time the Bella's have now graduated and travel abroad to the army where they meet up with new accapella groups the UCO's (run by Ruby Rose) and Brittany Snow's character develops a crush on a guy called Chicago played by Matt Latner. The Bella's later meet DJ Khalid(playing himself)who is impressed with Kendrick's character with her music and not the Bella's themselves. But who is she gonna choose the Bella's or DJ Khalid's offer?. Meanwhile Fat Amy(Rebel Wilson) meets her eccentric strange father played by John Lithgrow putting on an overbearing Australian accent ) who is spying on her and her friends.But is he all as he seems to be?Overall this is the shortest of the trilogy and to be honest I did enjoy it but its not as good as say the last 2 but I always liked the films and I thought that this was sorta disappointing with the finale scene.
If you love the first two then check it out.7/10",7,0,2,31 May 2018
Saving Mr. Banks," A very good movie
","Saving Mr Banks is a true story based on Mary Poppins creator PL Travers who visits Walt Disney who wants to make a movie out of it and she doesn't want it made into a movie.Now for those of you who never heard of Mary Poppins well its about a magical nanny named Mary Poppins(Julie Andrews) who minds Mr Banks children and meets Burt the chimney sweeper(aka Dick Van Dyke). So back to Saving Mr Banks. The movie is told in flashbacks as Helen(who is Pl Travers real name btw) is living in Australia with her alcoholic father(played by our very own Colin Farrell)and her mother along with her little sister. We then meet her as an adult(now played by the terrific Emma Thompson from Nanny McPhee)who goes to Los Angelus to meet Walt Disney(played by the brilliant Tom Hanks who surprisingly look like the real deal)as he wants her book of Mary Poppins to be made into a musical film. Of course she doesn't want it to be half animated or even a musical but with the team that is over Mary Poppins can they change her mind and make her love her book being turned into a film with Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke?SO what did I think of this movie well from the director of The Blind Side John Lee Hancock(which is one of my all time favourite movies of all time)I actually enjoyed this movie. Did I cry No call me heartless but I didn't cry at it. I knew that (Spoiler Alert btw) that PL Travers dad died from alcoholic poisoning and we see him die on the bed,and also she was sort of a bitch. I mean she was so cynical,so bitter you kinda wonder why was she acting like this and then we know why she was what she is. Overall the acting was great and I love Tom Hanks as Walt Disney he was fantastic as him,also you think he WAS Walt Disney. My only problem with it was that I felt like watching two movies. One with Colin Farrell(as PL Travers dad) and PL Travers as a kid and she changed her name from Helen to PL. And the other was her as an adult and been shown around by a limo driver played by The Amazing Spiderman 2 star Paul Giammatti and her meeting Walt Disney at his studio.For 2 hours this is a great film to watch as I bought it on DVD on Sunday for a bargain in HMV and I never seen it before so yes its definitely worthy if you love Tom Hanks in general or just a fan of Disney in general.Overall I am giving this a B +7/10",7,0,1,19 November 2014
Speed," I'm a 22 year old chick and I found this totally awesome
","So I am a kind of chick who loves watching romantic comedies,dramas,certain comedies and A lot of animated movies so when I got this movie for a bargain I had to buy it as I never seen it all before only bits of it on TV years ago.With a strong cast that includes my all time favourite actress Sandra Bullock,Keanu Reeves,and Jeff Daniels from the hilarious Dumb and Dumber film and awesome effects SPEED is a 1994 action packed movie about a cop who has to track down a bomber(played by Denis Hopper)who is an ex officer who seeks revenge and wants money from Jack(played by Reeves of course) and he wants it on a certain time. So when the bomber tells Jack that there is a bus that has a bomb underneath the bus, its up to Jack to try and stop it but there is a catch you see. The bus has to go up to 50 and if it slows down or if anyone has to stop the bus,the bus will explode. So the passengers have to try and stay calm and with a young woman on board called Annie(played by the brilliant Bullock)she helps Jack and drives the bus. But will the passengers get off the bus? Will the bomber strike again?Overall SPEED is a brilliant action packed movie that will have you on the edge of your seat. If your a dude and you love action packed movies and explosions than check it out or if your a young woman like me who is a MASSIVE fan of Sandra Bullock or any of the actors in this film than its worth checking out.10/10",10,2,4,16 February 2014
X2: X-Men United," Even better than the first outing X Men is a feel good comic book film
","X2: United(X Men 2) as its known as is a 2003 Comic Book film adaptation based on the X Men series and tells the tale about mutants fighting for mankind. This time however we are introduced to Alan Cumming's Nightcrawler a blue-skinned creature who can tele-port anywhere he wants to go. We first see him at the Presidents house as we later meet our new villain Skyler(Brian Cox) who gate-crashes into Professor Charles Xavier's(Patrick Stewart) mutant school and also happens to know Wolverine(Hugh Jackman)and he wants to defeat all the mutants and get to use his son as an experiment to enter Professor Charles head to get the mutants and defeat them. So can the X-Men team defeat Skyler and save Professor Charles while teaming up with former baddies Mystique(Rebecca Romijn)and Magneto(Ian McKellan)?Bottom line is X Men is a great Comic Book movie and this sequel is a lot better than the first installment as we get to see more of the charcthers, as the first outing focuses way too much on Wolverine and Rogue(who are still in this film BTW). The cast is fantastic,especially Hugh Jackman. This guy is multi-talented at what he does and every charcther he has played so far(in some of the films I have seen him in) he always acts different in every film. For example he can be the dashing prince charming like charcther in Kate & Leopold,a bad ass in X- Men,a magician in The Prestige the list goes on. James Marsden was great too but I feel like he never gets enough screen time as like I said before Hugh Jackman is the star of X-Men and I have no idea who is gonna replace him in the next 20 odd years or less.Like I said I loved X Men 2 and if you never seen it I highly recommend it. And this is coming from a 24 year old single straight woman who grew up with X-Men and Spiderman. Next review is X Men 3 The Last Stand and that is my trilogy marathon done and dusted.8/10PS Hugh Jackman is my all time celeb crush just saying the dude is so hot and drop dead gorgeous.",8,0,0,28 August 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," An enjoyable sci fi flick
","Star Wars The Force Awakens takes place 30 years after the original one left off which starred Harrison Ford,Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill who all reprise their roles here in this version. This time around and Luke Skywalker(Hamill) has vanished and its up to a young woman named Rey(played by newcomer Daisy Ridley)and Finn to team up with Han Solo(Harrison Ford)and fight against a new villain called Kylo Ren(Adam Driver)who is in charge over the first order. But what secret is Kylo hiding....without spoiling anything lets just say that Han Solo knows him pretty well. The effects are very well done,and it was nice to see Harrison Ford and co back again. Now I haven't seen a Star Wars movie since the 2002 flick Attack Of The Clones and I think I seen one of the originals as a kid which had Jar Jar Blinks,Yodi and Darth Vader. Sadly none of them are in this version as Vader died and I don't know what happened to the other charcthers. The story is well OK I guess its the effects that makes this movie likable like Avatar for example.There were a few twists and turns that I did not see coming at all. One charcther whom we all love in the Star Wars films gets killed off in the last 3rd act and I was shocked but I guess the actor that played this particular charcther had enough and wanted to do other projects. Daisy Ridley and that guy that was with her who played Finn were very good,I actually thought Ridley was like Lily James meets Kiera Knightly in some parts. Also I thought BB8 was cute he reminded me of Wall-E from Pixar.If you are a die hard fan of Star Wars then this is for you,but if your like me you only seen a few Star Wars films but you like action packed films then you may like it. Parts of it I didn't quite get but still I thought it was an excellent Sci Fi adventure.8/10Very GoodAlso I loved the John Williams score at the beginning of the film and if you own this on DVD you will be disappointed as there is no special features only the main film which is a shame.",8,5,21,26 April 2016
Cinderella," Nice film
","May contain spoilers I never even saw the Disney version of Cinderella before so when I heard that they were releasing it from the Disney Valut I had to get it as I wanted to see what it was like.Cinderella tells the story of a young girl named Cinderella who lives with her evil stepmother Lady Tremaine and her ugly stepsisters Drizella and Anastasia. Cinderella has to do everything in the house from cleaning floors,to getting their dinner ready etc etc. One night Cinderella gets an invitation for the ball which is for the whole household. With the help of some (irritating rats that sound like the rodents in Alvin & the Chipmunks) help her get ready for the ball by designing a dress but the dress gets ruined by Cinderella's evil stepsisters and her mother. But that doesn't stop Cinderella as her fairy godmother transforms Cinderella's rags into a beautiful gown and she goes off to the ball and a prince is enchanted by her beauty.You can probably figure the rest for yourselves but personally I may be 19 years old going on 20 but I am a sucker for fairy tales and animated movies(depending on what they are about). The story of Cinderella is very old-fashioned yet its a very romantic movie. This film is strictly for little girls aged 4 years of age who love dressing up as princesses and daydreaming about romance.Cinderella is a very enchanting flick. Check it out doesn't matter if you are a child or not watch it.",8,0,0,18 April 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," A great send off to the popular franchise which ran from 2001 to 2011
","As a kid Harry Potter was one of my favourite childhood movies growing up. I loved the cinematography,the characters,the score by John Williams(who did it until I think 2009),and as well as this it introduced me to Emma Watson(who is now in Beauty & The Beast as Belle). This last installment is all about Harry(played by Daniel Radcliffe)who goes head to head against his long time nemesis Lord Voldermort(who wants him dead,and he is played by an unrecognizable Ralph Fiennes)and its a battle against evil with Voldermort's companions(one played by Helena Bonham Carter and Jason Issacs)and Harry must try and save Hogwarts from the deadly hallows.After 10 years debuting on the Big Screen,this final film was very good. The story was good and the whole film was pretty intense. We also get to find out that Snape(late Alan Rickman)was in love with Harry Potter's mother Lily Potter who died from Voldermort when Harry was a baby and Snape seen Lily on the floor and was crying hysterically cradling her in his arms. Overall I enjoyed it",8,0,0,20 June 2017
Pitch Perfect," Think of it as another version of Glee and you get this fun feel good flick
","Pitch Perfect stars Anna Kendrick,Skylar Astin,Anna Camp,Brittany Snow and Rebel Wilson and tells the tale of an up and coming DJ named Becca(Kendrick)who is picked by a group called The Barden Bella's(ran by Brittany Snow and Anna Camp)after they had a disastrous final last year and they are setting up new members to try and pick up where they left off. Becca of course falls for a guy called Jesse(played by Skylar Astin who I swear could pass off as Zachary Levi's twin brother may I add)and of course The Barden Bella leader doesn't want any romance whatsoever involved cause that could ruin their group. So the new found group that involves Becca,and a few more including the hilarious Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy who is the showstopper here and they try and compete in the accapella finals.Overall I really enjoyed this movie as I got it on DVD recently and I was watching it last night. For those of you that don't know what Accapella is its basically a group of people that sing without any backing tracks as they do the backing tracks themselves with their mouths. The story was good and I liked the songs they did in Accapella style like Don't You Forget About Me from The Breakfast Club,The Tin Cup song,Let's Talk About Sex,and a few more. If you love Glee the TV show or if you watch YouTube and you listen to accapella music on that site then you will like this movie.Elizabeth Banks (who co-produced this film and directed the sequel which I also got)stars.8/10",8,0,0,25 July 2016
Tarzan," The last ever good Disney movie to come out of the 1990s before the new era began
","As a kid Tarzan was one of my all time favourite movies and even up to this day it STILL excites me and here are a few reasons why I love this movie.#1 The Story: Now a lot of Disney movies have great storytelling's but this one was brilliant. From the very beginning where we meet Tarzan as a baby with his parents as they escape their boat that went up in fire,to the part where we cut to the ape Kayla(voiced by Glen Close whom you may know was also Cruella De Vil in 101 and 102 Dalmatians)who rears Tarzan as her own(yeah its been done countless times before but who cares)to the gripping finale,it was just brilliant.#2 The music: I ADMIT it I love Phil Collins,from his Genesis days to his solo career he was the best musician of all time before he gave up singing and playing the drums due to some difficulties. I loved ALL the songs in this film,they were all so brilliant and my favourite has to be either You'll Be In My Heart or Strangers Like Me cause they were so memorable. Also Son Of A Man was so good.#3 Animation: Flawless and colorful.#4 The charcther design for Tarzan: I had the weirdest crush on him as a kid and heck I still find him attractive. I dunno why but I love how former Disney animator Glen Keane made him so fit and strong. Rumors had it that Glen based Tarzan on his son which was pretty cool.Everything else was brilliant too and it was kinda sad that this will forever be the last great hand drawn movie before Disney turned their flicks into Computer Generated format to beat Pixar but at least 14 years after this was made ANOTHER brilliant movie won me over...but you probably know what that is so I'm gonna leave it at that.Overall Tarzan is breathtaking and amazing and gets a 9.5/10",9,1,3,14 August 2013
Easy A," Actually enjoyable
","Easy A stars Emma Stone and Amanda Bynes and tells the story of a young girl called Olive who goes to high school and lies about losing her virginity as she is actually a virgin. How long will she keep the lie ?Emma Stone was great in this film. I think the highlight of this movie is Emma's charcther being super obsessed with Natasha Bedingfields song Pocketful of Sunshine where at first Olive hated the song and then she became hooked to the song.Amanda Bynes plays a nosy teen who later befriends Olive. Also starring Lisa Kudrow,Stanley Gucci Penn Badgesy and Dan Byrd. If you enjoyed Mean Girls then you'll probably like this film. It also has a throwback to the 80s .6/10

Fantastic Four," An OK movie but nothing to write home about
","I seen it a couple of times and its not a bad film so what is it about. These 5 people named Reed Richards(Welsh actor Ioan Grudffud),Susan Storm(Jessica Alba),Johnny Storm(Chris Evans),Ben Grimns(Micheal Chikis) and Dr Victor Von Doom(Julian McMahon)are all sent to space to find out something(which I have no idea what it is as the first 15 minutes into the film there literally stuck in space)that they all need to discover about. But when Ben goes into space and is attacked by a meteor,it instantly affects the rest of the group and they find out that they have special human powers.Reeds becomes Mr Fantastic as he stretches(literally),Susan becomes the Invisible Woman,Ben Grimns becomes The Thing(which is him covered in rocks looking like the love child of Hulk),Johnny becoming The Human Torch and what superhero movie isn't complete without a villain called Doom(who is made up of steel and Victor has to wear a mask to hid his face).Yeah yeah there's nothing really to tell its an average movie. Its not as good as Spiderman but hey if you want to watch a brainless superhero movie that's good in some places and bad everywhere else. Then check it out.For me its a 5.",5,0,3,28 June 2013

Click," Very funny. One of Adam Sandler's funniest roles
","Adam Sandler. Some of his films were very funny e.g The Wedding Singer,50 First Dates and Big Daddy,while more just sucked e.g
Jack and Jill. Click however is actually very funny. Here Adam plays Micheal a workaholic father who focuses more on work than his wife played by Kate Beckinsale. When he stumbles across a mysterious room where an eccentric scientist played by Christopher Walker gives him a magic remote control that controls Michael's life it soon takes a toll on his life.

Minions," The funniest family movie of the year
","Yesterday my mom,my younger brother and myself all went to see Minions in 3D(this was my mom's first 3D film to see,as it was my 3rd having seen Avengers Age Of Ultron and Brave in 3D) as my little brother was dying to see this film and having watched and own both Despicable Me 1 and 2 I was looking forward to seeing it too.The story is told by Gregory Rush(Pirates Of The Caribbean) who is the narrator of the film and tells us how the minions evolved during the prehistoric times all the way to 1968 New York City. So the minions of course are on the lookout for a master as they are depressed and bored that they have no one to look after their species. So Kevin,Bob and Stuart travel to 1968 New York City and they find out that there is a Villain Con featuring a mastermind villianess named Scarlet Overkill(voiced by my all time favourite actress Sandra Bullock in her 2nd animated debut as her first was the 1998 classic The Prince Of Egypt)where she is on the look out for sidekicks to help her steal the Queen's crown(pretty much similar to the first Despicable Me movie with Gru wanting to steal the moon)so the minions get a ride to go to the Villain Con in Orlando,Florida with a family who happens to have stolen from the bank(the father is voiced by Micheal Keaton from my guilt pleasure movie Jack Frost,and his one of my favourite actors of all time too)and the minions finally get chosen later as Scarlet's sidekicks.So the minions team up with her and her mastermind husband Herb(voiced by Jon Hamm from Shrek 4 and Mad Men)and they help her get the Queen's crown. But could she be their new master or she is only using them to get what she wants?Now let me tell you I loved the first two Despicable Me movies so i'm gonna tell you the good and the bad.Good: The animation is very good and the voice acting is terrific like I have mentioned I love Sandra Bullock since the mid 1990's as she is my all time favourite actress and I have seen nearly every Bullock film she was ever in. Also there is a lot of laughs in this film that had me choking up with laughter especially when one of the minions wasn't allowed to go to see the Queen and the 3(Stuart,Bob and Stuart)disguised themselves as a woman and that just cracked me up as well as the beginning where we see the minions like tadpoles in the beginning and they were following a caveman behind and singing a Christmas carol. Bad: For me I think this was a cash in so that more kids can buy more minion toys/merchandise and they don't even speak English its like there speaking polish or whatever as its all gibberish they say. Also the minions can get pretty irritating but its only on for an hour and 35 mins so its not that bad. Also I was a bit disappointed that Pharell Williams had no songs in the film as he was the one that made Despicable Me entertaining because the songs he wrote were so catchy like Fun,Fun,Fun,Happy(in Despicable Me 2) and of course the main them Despicable Me.Verdict: If you loved the first two Despicable Me movies then you are going to love this movie. Overall I really liked this movie,it was funny ,entertaining and strictly for hardcore minion/Despicable Me fans only.My mom's rating: 7/10 My brother:10/10 Me: 7/10Spoilers ahead: Also Jennifer Saunders from Shrek 2 voices the Queen and at the end we see a young Gru(Steve Carell) steal the Queen's crown and the minions follow him in the end(and that is how they met up with Gru in the first place).",7,11,23,29 June 2015
Aladdin," Robin Williams makes this movie the way it is
","OMG I loved this film since I was a kid. I bought the DVD of it 2 years ago and I was so glad that I bought it. The story is about a commoner who stumbles across an enchanted lamp that holds a hilarious blue Genie who grants him 3 wishes. Aladdin falls in love with an Arabian princess who's father wants her to marry but she doesn't want to marry someone that she doesn't love so one day she disguises herself as a commoner and as the people at the marketplace think that Aladdin is a street rat she is smitten by him. I could go on but I am not giving away too many details as some people mightn't even see this film before. Packed with great music and a great message for people who are commoners and that is 'Accept a person who isn't from a royal background and don't pretend to be a prince(which Aladdin did as he was in love with Jasmine and he thinks that she doesn't date or marry nobody's) and that you just have to be yourself. The chemistry between Aladdin & Jasmine is absolutely fantastic and I love the A Whole New World Scene because its so magical. The real star to this movie is of course Robin Williams who was so hilarious in this movie I laughed so hard every time he impersonates someone e.g Jack Nicolsen or that guy that plays the terminator Arnold (I don't know the surname) but having said that he is the best comedian of all time along with Jim Carrey. The animation is very well done and the ballad A Whole New World is so cute. A friend like me & Prince Ali which is both sung by Robin Williams(yes folks he can sing) are so funny I loved it. Aladdin is my 4th favourite movie of all time along with The Little Mermaid, Beauty & the Beast & Enchanted.Worth watching for all you Disney lovers like me.",10,1,2,20 September 2010

When Elasticgirl voiced by Holly Hunter has received an offer with Hunter Boyd(if I am correct) who wants all superheros to come together she leaves her husband Bob voiced by Craig T Nelson to look after the kids. But when a mysterious villain called screensaver starts hypnotising people in order to eliminate superheros all together can Elasticgirl save the world on her own
Bottom line I enjoyed this film. I have seen the original a very long time ago and I have it forgotten. My mom thought it was okay and my brother liked it. The only issue I had was someone in the cinema a little girl spoilt it for me and the film itself focused more on Elasticgirl's popularity than the rest of the characters. I was glad I seen it and probably get it on DVD along with the first one

Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Meh it was OK
","A prequel to the 2008 one and BOY does it NOT change at all. This time Alex and the gang are on the run from an evil French Animal killer(who I swear is the dead ringer of Mother Gothel from Tangled down to the features and Cruella De Vil's persona)who is trying to kill Alex for her collection of animal heads that she got.So Alec and the gang head off to Europe as they stumble across a circus hideout where Alec meets a female tiger like himself(well his a Lion I know that) and well you can probably figure out the rest yourselves.The animation is great and the charcthers are good,now I tell you one of my favourite scenes,its the part where Alec and the female tiger are going around in loops to the song Firework by Katy Perry and another was the part where Marty the Zebra was driving the car with Alec and his other CO,that was so funny.But since this looks like the last one of the trilogy.I hope that there isn't another sequel to this movie. It was fun while it lasted and it was an OK send off to Dreamwork's Madagascar.",4,6,9,14 May 2013
A Walk to Remember," Get those hankies ready for this tearjerker starring Tangled's Mandy Moore.
",I watched this on DVD last night and I have to say I actually liked the movie even though there were some parts to the film that I found a bit confusing like Landon falling in love with Jamie all of a sudden.The film is based on a novel by Nicolas Sparks who also did THE NOTEBOOK and the 2010 movie starring MILEY CRYUS THE LAST SONG and tells the story about a high school bad boy named Landon Carter(SHANE WEST FROM GET OVER IT)who has to do community service as a prank with a fellow student from school goes horribly wrong. As he is doing community service from his school he meets a Christian girl named Jamie Sullivan(TANGLED'S MANDY MOORE) whom he knew since kindergarten according to the film. As he is practicing his lines for the school play he asks Jamie to help him but when he sees her in the play he starts to fall in love with her as she promised him previously in an earlier scene that he shouldn't fall for her because she is hiding a terrible secret from him she is dying of leukemia and has several months to live. As she spends the last months dying she wrote a list on things to do before she dies and so Landon decides to help her make all those miracles come true.I liked the chemistry between Moore and West because it was kinda like a star crossed lover scenario between the two and I also like the story that goes with it you've got a bad boy who starts to become more nicer and kind and a shy girl who's father is a Christian minister. I also find it very sad as Jamie died in the end.If you are up for a sad romantic drama then check it out or if not then rent out a happy Rom com instead.,10,0,0,23 January 2011
Joy," Good movie but the story was lacking
","Joy is a 2015 drama based on a true story directed by David O Russell and stars Bradley Cooper,Robert De Niro and Jennifer Lawrence(all three of these actors worked in the 2012 flick Silver Lining's Playbook)and the story is about a young woman named Joy(Lawrence)who sets up a manufacturing factory where she creates these mops where you can take the top part off and put it in a washing machine. She deals with a divorce,being a single mother,having her madcap father (played by De Niro)who is staying with her and her ex husband who is now her friend)don't ask)and Joy goes to different companies so that she can try and sell her mop and get an earning.She meets a man named Neil Walker(Bradley Cooper)who helps her out to sell these mops she created. So will she become a household name after this?Overall this film was pretty decent,its not as good as Silver Lining's Playbook as the story felt more better,here the story just dragged and dragged and dragged and I said to myself what is this film about I can't make head or tails of what this premise is about. The acting was good though Jennifer is a pretty decent actress,she's no Julie Andrews or Kate Winslet but she did a pretty good job here. If you are a fan of Lawrence's then check it out,for me it was an OK movie. Not one to watch a billion times again though.5/10C+Not bad but not that great. Watch Silver Lining's Playbook instead.",5,0,0,23 July 2016
Me Before You," I laughed I cried I really found this movie touching
","Last night myself and my mom decided to go to the cinemas to see the new movie Me Before You. Me Before You is a novel turned movie starring Emillia Clarke and Sam Claffin and tells the tale of a young man named Will Trainer(Claffin)who has it all. His got a nice flat and a nice girlfriend,until one rainy afternoon his life would change forever as he ends up being paralyzed from the neck down and is confined in a wheelchair thanks to being hit with a motorbike. We later cut to a young woman named Lou Clark(Emillia Clarke)who is living with her parents and her sister and has an athletic boyfriend named Patrick(played by Matthew Lewis from Harry Potter fame). She's working in a coffee shop only to be told from her boss that its not working for him to keep her on in his coffee shop. So with no money to help her get through her life she goes to a job centre where she is looking for a job. Turns out this well off couple wants help with their son(who happens to be Will of course)and Lou decides to take up the position as a Career for Will.And from here on in you can pretty much expect what is going to happen. The two don't get along,they later start to become friendly with one another,and of course they fall in love. But will he get help with being confined to a wheelchair or will he decide to end his life ?Also starring Brax himself former Home & Away star Steven Peacocke as Nathan(the assistant nurse that helps Lou with Will and a brief cameo from Joanna Lumely,this touching romantic drama will leave you either laughing and crying or both. For mom and myself we both found this film very good. The acting is very good I liked the guy that played the young man Will he reminded me of James Marsden for some strange odd reason and him and Emilla Clarke had great chemistry. The music was very good and as for the ending, well I won't give away too much on the ending but I knew that it was going to happen about the 2nd half into this flick and trust me you will want Kleenex tissues after it. Overall I loved this movie and I was glad that I dragged my mom(who also wanted to go and see this with me last night as well).My rating is a 9/10 and I give it a 4 out of 5 stars.BVery good flick It actually reminded me of a cross between The Fault In Our Stars(one of my all time favourite movies ever)and that Julia Roberts flick Dying Young. SEE IT",9,5,7,6 June 2016
The Breakfast Club," The Breakfast Club is a true 80s classic
","My cousin introduced me to this film last year as I told him I have never seen this movie in my life. To be fair I thought it was a pretty good flick. The story is as follows. A group of misfits have to spend one Saturday afternoon in detention as they all done bad things. So they all start befriending each other and they all come up with a brainwave to try and escape detention. But will the 5 high schoolers escape?The acting was very good(from Emilo Estevez who is Charlie Sheen's brother who was in The Mighty Ducks,to Molly Ringwald to Anthony Micheal Hall)down to the soundtrack(Don't You Forget About Me),this 80s movie is timeless. If they ever thought about remaking it I wouldn't think it would work. One scene I remember was the misfits escaping and they spotted a janitor and hid so that the janitor wouldn't find them.I did a review of this a while back but for some strange reason it got deleted. If you haven't seen it then be sure and check it out the next time its playing on TV. From the man that brought you Home Alone 2 I give this movie a thumbs up.",7,0,0,23 July 2015
Pocahontas," The special edition to this movie is a lot better than the original
","Pocahuntas is a 1995 Disney movie based on true life events about a Native American Princess who falls in love with a handsome English sailor named John Smith. I got this on DVD two years ago and I actually enjoyed this movie.I have the special edition if this movie and it features John Smith singing to Pocahuntas called If I never Knew You which was cut in the original 1995 version. The music is brilliant Alan Menkin & Stephen Schwartz(Enchanted,HBOND),the characters are great,the chemistry between John Smith and Pocahuntas is so romantic and very sweet I liked them in this movie,the story is very well put together as it centers on Pocahuntas who is the heroine of this film.I truly enjoyed this film but if you never seen the sequel then avoid as it isn't as magical or fun as the original masterpiece from Walt Disney pictures.Another thing is that I love the song If I never knew you as its so romantic and I never realized that Mel Gibson was a great singer. Trust me I have it on DVD for 2 years and its 100% better than the sequel which was just awful.",9,2,5,24 September 2010
The Wedding Singer," Not a bad film but similar to Music & lyrics
",OK I have seen this before on TV and I thought it was funny. The movie features 50 First Date's actors Drew Barromore and Adam Sandler and tells the story of a washed singer who performs at weddings. He falls for a young waitress(Barrowmore)who is engaged to a man who doesn't really love her Robbie(sandler)himself was also suppose to marry too but his fiancé left him at the alter.Every time I watch this film I could see a similarity of Music & Lyrics which also told the story of a washed pop star who falls for a girl(Barromore again) and both actors sing(Grant & Sandler). I know I am only suppose to review one film but I could see a lot of similarities.If you like Adam Sandler and Rom Com's where you've got a guy fallen for a girl who is already taken then check it out.,5,2,4,25 November 2010
The Pursuit of Happyness," Good biopic starring the fresh prince himself
",The story of The Pursuit of Happiness is about a struggling father who rears his son on his own (both played by real life father and son Will Smith and Jaden Smith)as his girlfriend(played by British actress Thandie Newton) is so sick of him and has enough). Problems arise for Chris Gardiner(Smith)as the only thing that he relies on is a device that is used for medical grounds allowing Chris to get wages as his very poor and hasn't got much wages. He gets his wages of Chuck Star Christopher Mark Lawrence(you know Big Mike that's over Buy More).But later he struggles and Chris and his son sleeps in a subway and later in a hostel.Eventually he applies for a job as a stockbroker headed by Dan Castelltia (I can't spell his surname but you know him in The Simpsons as Homer and also he voiced Robin Williams Genie in Return to Jafar) in order for him to get more wages and make his son proud.The movie starts off slow enough but Will Smith is a very good actor and singer so it was nice for him to star in a movie that's both touching and serious at the same time.Overall I enjoyed it and its worth watching.7.5 out of 10,7,0,0,30 November 2013
Back to the Future," Were going to go back in time
","I seen this a few days ago since it was Back To The Future Day and I haven't seen it in a long time. The story is about a young teen named McFly(played by Micheal J Fox)who teams up with a Dr played by Christopher Lyold who happens to be a time traveller. So he invents this car that can bring you back in time. So McFly ends up taking the time travelling car and ends up in the year October 21st 1955 where he has to try and bring is parents back together again. But when McFly's mother ends up falling for McFly things get sorta complicated. So can McFly go back to his own time?Bottom line this was a feel good movie and I highly recommend it. The story is a tad bit silly,the music is great by Hewy Lewis and the actors seem to have a great time in this movie.",6,2,6,23 October 2015
The Great Gatsby," I thought I was going to hate this movie as it was directed by the man that brought us Moulin Rouge.
","The Great Gatsby is based on a 1925 novel by F Scott Fitzgerald and tells the tale of a writer named Nick Carroway(played by the original Spiderman star Tobey Maguire) who is at the doctors and tells the doctor the story of a penniless man who became a millionaire as he had a wide imagination and was in love with a woman who is already married. So Nick talks to the doctor about it and we see Nick staying in a house where next door Jay Gatsby(played by Leonardo Di Caprio from Titanic and his best friends with Maguire in real life)in the year 1922. Every night Jay would throw a party where there's singing and dancing taking place,and of course hopes that his former flame will return to him again called Daisy(played by Carey Mulligan) who is already married to a man named Tom(played by Joel Edgerton)for the last 5 years or more,as Jay left her because he was a war veteran. Daisy however is actually Nick's cousin so when she and Jay are reunited can the two love birds be together,and will Daisy leave her husband for Gatsby?SO what did I like about this film well the visuals are stunning as well as the costumes as the film is rather old-fashioned,also I thought Leo Di Caprio was great as Gatsby the charismatic billionaire who is actually a penniless man who inherited some man's fortune as he met the man on a yacht who wanted Gatsby's help when Gatsby was a teenager. Also in this film is Isla Fisher(from Confessions of a Shopaholic) who looks barely recognizable with her 1920s outfit and sporting a strong New York accent.And now for the bad. Actually two things I have to say. Now this maybe a spoiler so I'm not gonna say what charcther dies or the person playing the charcther but I will give hint. So first is the music,now don't get me wrong some of the songs worked but what on earth is Kanye West,Jay Z(who is the executive producer for this film),Will.I.Am and Lana Del Ray as well as Jay Z's wife Beyonce got to do with the 1920s ? Shouldn't the director of the film get old fashioned music like Ella Fitzgerald,Louis Armstrong etc on the soundtrack and not these pop stars. Another thing I noticed was that one charcther dies and the actor that plays him ALWAYS get killed in his movies. Now I am not saying the name of the actor as it could be any actor in this movie but why is it that the filmmakers kill this person off for? I would have liked if it was someone else that died,but since this is based on a novel we can't change history can we.Overall The Great Gatsby is a stunning film to look at. A bit too long as it somewhat drags in the middle of the film but for 136 minutes its a great movie.Winner of 2 Oscars and won other awards too mainly for the Costume Design I give it a thumbs up.",7,1,2,30 August 2014
The Proposal," A funny Rom com
","Sandra Bullock(TWO WEEKS NOTICE)& Ryan Reynolds(JUST FRIENDS)star in this romantic comedy about a businesswoman named Margaret Tate(Bullock) who is about to be deported to Canada as her visa is expired. She comes up with a plan and makes out that she is engaged to Andrew Paxton(Reynolds) who is her secretary. The two then have to go to Alaska where Andrew's parents live and they have to pretend that they are actually in love with one another because they don't want anyone to get suspicious about it. As day goes by the two start to like each other for real and they soon realize that what they are doing is wrong.I quite enjoyed this movie as there was a lot of funny scenes from Sandra Bullock rapping a song with Betty White chanting in the woods,Ryan & Sandra getting naked and they fell on top of one another(yes it is awkward isn't it it makes you want to barf),the hilarious hen do with the guy in the shop stripping off and showing his butt and Sandra getting embarrassed. The chemistry between Reynolds & Bullock was good(I heard that these two spend New Years eve together in real life hmm I wonder will they actually date in real life who knows). The story was good yet it reminds me of that Mellisa Joan Hart movie My Fake Fiancé which was from ABC Family in 2009.If you like MY FAKE Fiancé then you will like this.BEST SCENE: Where Margaret is singing Get Low in the woods. Where her and Andrew fall on top of one another WORST SCENE: The ending could have been better(the alternative ending from the DVD was better than the one they already used in the film).BEST QUOTE Margaret I'm asking you to marry me,because I want to date you.",7,0,1,6 January 2011
Sully," Excellent movie starring Tom Hanks
","Sully is a 2016 biography film based on the true story of a pilot named Chelsey Sullenberger who saved the lives of 115 people by landing on the River Hudson on the 15th of January 2009. Tom Hanks plays the heroic pilot who is being hailed a hero yet some news reporters think that his a fraud because they don't believe for a second that the engines were at fault and that he couldn't have saved all those people at the time it happened. Chelsey(Hanks)must prove to the members of the public that he is telling the truth of what happened(which is told in flashbacks from when he got into piloting and the time it happened in January 2009). Since the crash,Chelsey keeps getting nightmares of what if the plane crashed in one of the buildings and never landed in the River Hudson. So will he tell the news reporters what really happened and will they believe him?Also starring Aaron Eckhart as Hanks Co.Pilot and directed by legendary film star Clint Eastwood this hour and a half film is definitely worth watching. As for me I was always a fan of Tom Hanks,as you could say his my favourite actor of all time. His been on the go since the 80's having starred in the likes of Big,Splash,all the Toy Story films,the list goes on and on. Packed with suspense and thriller this film Sully is the kind of film to watch if you love plane crashes or true life stories. 9/10",9,0,0,23 April 2017
Beetlejuice," Michael Keaton showcases his zany persona in this horror comedy
","Directed by Tim Burton(The Nightmare Before Christmas,Dumbo,and Edward Scissorhands to name a few) Beetlejuice stars Geena Davis, Alec Baldwin and Micheal Keaton and tells the story of a deceased couple who bring back a zany zombie called Bettlejuice and only a girl played by Winoa Ryder can set them free to their aftermath.The effects are good,Micheal Keaton was the showstealer and also parts are really creepy especially the snake scene and the headless scenes.",6,1,1,4 November 2019
The Wizard of Oz," A true classic movie that just celebrated 75 years in film history.
","I finally got this on DVD a few days ago and was watching it last night. To this day I still have this as one of my favourite movies of all time. Where does it mark my list I am not so sure but anyway here is the review.Dorothy(Judy Garland) is a young girl living in Kansas with her aunt and uncle and the film of course starts off as a sepia toned film. Dorothy of course gets upset as a woman wanted to get rid of her dog Toto and she runs away,only to get whisked away into the magical world of OZ. Now Dorothy is in the magical world and she has to try and find a way home. Along the way she meets a wicked witch,a white witch named Glenda,a lovable lion who wants courage,a tin man who wants a heart and a scarecrow who wants a brain who are all very well done.So here is the good,the bad and the verdict.The good: The visuals are very good (yet I did find a problem with it as well which will be talked about in the bad section). The cast was very good,especially the late Judy Garland who did it justice as Dorothy our main heroine in the film and the premise is original and not predicable. Think of it as Alice In Wonderland where she goes to another dimension and the 2013 James Franco flick OZ The Great & Powerful which was also a fantastic film.The music was very good too especially the iconic song Somewhere Over The Rainbow and Follow The Yellow Brick Road.The bad: The backgrounds are just so false looking. Maybe its just me but you know once you see it in the colourful world that its not real as it looks like canvas in the background. Also the songs can get too irritating from time to time but I loved them all the same.Final verdict: Overall this is a film that I have loved since I was a child and I was so happy to have picked up the 2 Disc DVD version of it in HMV a few days ago. If you haven't seen it I recommend it to everyone,who loves a good fantasy and musical.Thumbs up.Visuals: 7/10 Premise:9/10 Characters: 9/10 Setting: 5/10Overall rating: B+9.5/104.5 stars because the backgrounds were fake.",9,4,5,15 April 2015
Atonement," Half of it isn't bad the other is half is slightly confusing and depressing.
","Atonement is a 2007 Romantic War Mystery Drama and tells the story of a young girl named Briory(played by Irish Actress Saoirse Ronan)who is an inspiring writer who has a sister Celia(Kiera Knightly looking ever so elegant)who is going out with Robbie(played by James Mcavoy)whom Briory thinks sexual assaulted her cousin.Eventually Robbie gets arrested and is sent out to war. But did Robbie rape Briory's cousin?? and will Robbie ever be reunited with the lovely Celia.So what do I like about it? Well the story is nice as its got this Downtown Abbey feel to it,and Kiera Knightly and James Mcavoy have great chemistry together. Normally i'm not keen on these kind of films but they bore me to death and so my cousin lend it to me as I never seen it before.What I didn't like about this movie is the actual setting and the plot,part of it was repeated like one scene where Briory witnessed Celia and Robbie making out in the library and it was shown again what happened at the library. Also its (and I know I'm going to get hated for this) BORING AS HELL.DO yourselves a favour and watch something fun loving and less bland.The Notebook was WAY better than this.5/10",5,0,1,10 September 2013
