Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Hardcore fans are a little too critical.
","Say what you will about the prequels. I think hardcore fans are a little too dramatic about how bad they are.The original Star Wars trilogy was a masterpiece and Lucas is a human being. A human being who just wants to make the best movies possible.Sure he didn't need to make them. But, people wanted them bad enough that he made them for his fans. These films aren't the Holiday Special at least. If you want true bastardization then that's the golden standard.For me they were each enjoyable, especially if you like the originals. The scope and atmosphere of the prequels is better then most of the CGI garbage that tries to pass as a film. These films are epics. Sure they have flaws. But, the art direction and visuals alone are enough to admire them. I mean Darth Maul's double light sabre is a epic of epic epicness, I don't care what you say.But, of course the originals are masterpieces, why the prequels are mostly entertainment.",7,10,17,22 April 2011
Frozen," The hype can ruin it for you.
","This isn't Disney's best in the last 20 years... Tangled & Wreck-it Ralph were definitely superior. That being said this is enjoyable and is worth a watch. Music is fun, story is pretty good. However, if you go in expecting a modern Beauty and The Beast or Aladdin, I promise you'll want to shut the film off.Seriously! While the music & story is fun.... It's not on the level of Beauty and the Beast, Lion King, Aladdin, Etc. I shut off this movie in disgust the first time 40 mins in! Why? Because I was expecting greatness on the level of Disney classics. I was trying to see how this film was on par with 'Beauty and The Beast'It's not... But, on giving it a second chance a while later, I found myself loving it!Why? Because of the amazing music and entertainment value. However, it's only entertaining from a scene to scene point of view. As a whole the story is full of plot holes and baffling ideas (Read any negative review for more detail). Whole important plot points are shown only to be never spoken of. Also the secondary characters are never really developed enough for us to understand their motivations. (e.g. Why the heck is Kristoff a ice seller raised by Trolls and not the ice sellers in the first scene?)The film does work. But, it really shouldn't from a storytelling standpoint.What makes Frozen a good film is the beautiful world, amazing music, fun characters! Most importantly the excitement of each scene prevents the viewer from ever having the chance to really dwell on these story problems long enough.That being said. The lack of a flow/ connection between some scenes is what prevents it from being a modern 'Beauty and The Beast'. Go in expecting something a little less satisfying then How to Train Your Dragon and you'll enjoy it.",7,6,11,16 March 2014
