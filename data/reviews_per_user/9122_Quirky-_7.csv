Catch Me If You Can," Groovy 60's fun from Spielberg
","***SPOILERS IN REVIEW***A breezy, very enjoyable film from the title credits onwards, Steven Spielberg's latest, 'Catch Me If You Can' is not a particularly important film from the blockbuster man, but it's good, guilt-free fun for a couple of hours. Frank William Abagnale, Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a young man, son of a stationery store owner and a mother from provincial France, whose life is suddenly torn apart when his apparently in love parents announce their imminent divorce. Young Abagnale panics at the very notion of his parents being apart and hot foots it down the streets of NYC. After this spontaneous running away, Frank Jr. must somehow make a livingwhich leads to the idea of forging bank cheques. This forgery doesn't go unnoticed by the FBI, where Special Agent Carl Hanratty (a bespectacled Tom Hanks) is on the case, desperate to track down the chameleonic Abagnale. After some credible impersonations of pilots, doctors, CIA agents and lawyers (and a few others), Abagnale has racked up almost $4 million and the FBI is close to tracking him downAt 140 minutes, the film feels a little too long, although the time doesn't drag with the proceedings. DiCaprio is excellent as Abagnale, Christopher Walken is tragically funny as Frank, Sr. and Hanks is good as the always-on-the-job, Hanratty. As I said, it's not a particularly significant film in Spielberg's career, but it's a lot of fun. 8.5/10",9,0,1,19 January 2003
Minority Report," Sci-fi fun from Spielberg
","***SPOILERS WITHIN REVIEW***A small achievement in the sci-fi genre, Steven Spielberg's adaptation of Phillip K. Dick's short story, Minority Report is a good chase 'em thriller. Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, head of the pre-crime unit, a special branch of the police force that uses technology to 'tag' and arrest 'criminals' before they actually commit a murder. These prophecies are the work of three pre-cogs (short for pre-cognitives), a young woman and two twin brothers who were the pregnant results of drug addicts. All goes wrong for Anderton's world when the female pre-cog, Agatha, points him out as a future murderer. Anderton hits the road running from Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) and his old police crew, unearthing long lost secrets and conspiracies.
The pre-cogs, Agatha (Samantha Morton), Dashiell and Arthur (named for Agatha Christie, Dashiell Hammett and Arthur Conan Doyle) are mysterious, almost angelic creatures - until Agatha is liberated by Anderton for her help, we don't really see them as humans - and the scenes with Agatha giving Anderton prophetic help have an other-worldly quality. Like previous Phillip K. Dick adaptations Blade Runner and Total Recall, Minority Report's special effects team (ILM) have created some very impressive effects, among the metal three legged Spyders; robotic spies employed by the pre-crime that scan people's eyes for identification, and futuristic cars and motorways, as well as other ultramodern creations. The pre-crime advertisements in the film (à la Starship Troopers) are effective in their designs and give us added insight into the goings-on of the pre-crime unit.
The performances are all solid, with Tom Cruise giving a good turn as the on-the-run police chief and Colin Farrell great as a smarmy competitor for Anderton's position who realises too late the truth of the investigation. Max von Sydow, playing the elderly head of the pre-crime facility, Lamar Burgess, is a kind of surrogate father to Anderton. Continuing the oft-used theme of paternal abandonment in his films, Minority Report's abandoned son is Cruise, with the scheming von Sydow betraying his 'son' in order to save his own hide. Of course, redemption is reached at the end, giving the viewer a happy ending. Janusz Kaminski's photography is impressively cold, effectively matching the overall mood of the film (the script, music, etc.) and enhancing the film noir sensibilities Spielberg and co. were aiming for. Interestingly, Spielberg notes that Minority Report is not a `warm adventure like A.I'. He's right in that regard, as this film doesn't share as much of the sentimentality that almost sank that picture. I liked the film a lot (all the more so because 'sci-fi' isn't ordinarily my favoured genre), but there were flaws that held back my enjoyment of the finished product. That said, I can't pinpoint any particularly grating imperfections, although I do know that it won't hold up to repeated viewings in my DVD player. An effective sci-fi thriller from a very talented director...the film taps into our need to know what the future holds for us.8/10",8,0,0,26 January 2003
The English Patient," Beautiful, sensual and Unforgettable!
","Anthony Minghella's faithful adaptation of Michael Ondaatje's Booker-prize winning novel is a film of epic proportions, catapulting the viewer into a world of turmoil circa. WWII. Although some of the plot details and characters have been cut, it still does not detract from the overall greatness of the film. The English Patient fell, and falls, victim to the criticism of those who believe that it is either too sappy', too long' or all those Oscars mean it is just Hollywood trash being hawked to the public'. Well, it may be sappy, but it is beautiful also. And for those who argue it is too long (260mins) may just need to stop complaining. A film of this magnitude needs that amount of time to tell its story and to tell it well. And do it well it does! The script by Minghella is excellent, whilst the acting is sensational on the part of every actor credited. The cinematography adds to the romantic and beautiful feel of this film. A masterpiece indeed.",10,8,15,20 April 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Wonderfully over the top, camp fun...
","Moulin Rouge was surely a better film than Ron Howard's TV movie of the week weepie that eventually garnered a Best Picture Oscar in 2001 (A Beautiful Mind, in case you've blocked memories of THAT abomination out of your mind) and the fact that Baz Luhrmann failed to even secure a Best Director nomination in the face of such a low-grade 'true story' speaks volumes about the Academy.Lurhmann's film is a colourful swirl of song and dance, with Nicole Kidman giving a dazzling (and surprisingly good) performance as the doomed Satine, while Ewan McGregor acquits himself well as usual, even if neither of the lead actors can sing particularly well. That, however, is half the fun of Moulin Rouge -- where the characters break into song, the singing talents (or lack thereof) of the actors gives the re-modelled song numbers (Diamond Dogs, Children of the Revolution, Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend, Roxanne, Lady Marmalade, etc) a fun, almost spontaneous feel.It's a wonderfully inventive pastiche of the musical genre that deserves the recognition and success it received upon release. Lots of fun.",8,1,2,16 April 2002
Donnie Brasco," Good, solid mob effort from Mike Newell
","Inevitably compared to Goodfellas, Mike Newell's 1997 effort, Donnie Brasco is just as good as Scorcese's film in many regards. The performances, including Johnny Depp as the title character and Al Pacino as his wretched wise guy pal, are flawless, with Depp great as the undercover FBI agent and Pacino in excellent form as Benjamin Lefty' Ruggiero. A less romanticised, more low-key look at mob life, Donnie Brasco follows Special Agent Joseph Piston, known to the mafia as Donnie Brasco, a friend of Lefty's who, unbeknownst to his mob friends, is collecting enough evidence to put them all away for many years. Too late, Lefty and his colleagues realise they've been had. Also coming to an overdue realisation is Joseph/Donnie who, too late, recognises his genuine affection for down and out Lefty and the predicament he's placed him in by befriending him. There are some justifications as to the Goodfellas comparisons, however: Bruno Kirby's Nicky sounds eerily like Joe Pesci's Tommy DeVito, even encompassing a similar kind of character. Moreover, the gaudy excess of Goodfellas is also on display Donnie Brasco, with the similar period setting and plot points (the bringing down of the mafia). However, the comparisons should probably end there, as they are two different films. In one of the funnier moments of the film (albeit, darkly humourous), Lefty (Pacino) laments to Donnie about being left out of the hit on their boss. This kind of tragicomedy also makes Pacino's character the more sympathetic of the two, I think. Lefty's greatest dream is to board a boat and escape his way of life. Although he underplays his role, Pacino still manages to overshadow every scene he's in. As a true story, it's also pretty fascinating; with the closing credits, we learn that the real Joseph Pistone, through his undercover work, ensured that 200 indictments and 100 convictions brought against the mob. An achievement for Pistonejust like the film is for Newell. 8/10",Null,0,0,26 January 2003
The Thin Red Line," Deserved every available award for '98
","The reclusive Terrence Malick came out of a 20 year sabbatical to direct this stunning adaptation of James Joyce's novel. Oscar winning cinematographer John Toll's photography is achingly beautiful and is only one of the many highlights of this tremendous film, which was itself one of the few highlights of the '98 film season. The script and score are also invaluable in producing this hauntingly real film. Although robbed by Shakespeare In Love of the Best Picture award, The Thin Red Line is one of the many examples of those films that totally surpassed their 'competitors' when it came to the award. Unfair comparisons to Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan turned many would-be viewers away. (Well, that and the 3-hour running time perhaps). Whereas SPR was a war film that showed the unabashed glory of war, THRL is a more cerebral and un-Hollywood take on war, showing the ugliness and futility that wars produced. Malick's script doesn't suffer from pretension as others have argued; it is just a brave enough piece to juxtapose intellectualism with the action' of war. The acting by the ensemble, led mostly by James Caviezel and Ben Chaplin(yes, i know its an ensemble) is all mostly well above par. The actors deliver their lines with aplomb, not degrading the humanitarianism with smirking preaching. Although the cameos' by John Travolta and George Clooney do bring this aspect down, as they simply seem to be overacting, showing off as it were.	The Thin Red Line is one of the most beautifully acted, written and directed films of the last century, as well as being one of the best war' films ever produced. Absolutely stunning.",9,0,0,20 April 2002
The Thin Red Line," A modern masterpiece.
","***SPOILERS IN REVIEW***Hauntingly beautiful in every regard, Terrence Malick's third film to date, 'The Thin Red Line' is cinematic bliss. A study of life, death and war in nature, the film traces American soldiers fighting in the South Pacific  the Guatemala Canal  and their fight for survival. Told from several perspectives, the film relies occasionally on voiceovers, something that can sound the death knell for films when used in a lazy fashion. These voiceovers, especially that of Jim Caviezel's character Private Witt, actually assist the viewer, lending us a heightened sense of compassion for these men, most of whom see the futility and waste of war. Different from Spielberg's war opus, 'Saving Private Ryan'  the films are often unfairly compared due to their sharing the same year of release  Malick's film does not rely so heavily on the lauded action set pieces that made Spielberg's film seemingly everybody's new favourite war' film. Sure, there's action in 'The Thin Red Line', but in between the shoot em ups, we aren't bored by the philosophical ponderings of the characters, unlike the generally trite reflections contained in 'Saving Private Ryan'. (I should probably point out at this point, for fear of being labelled merely as a Spielberg hater' that I actually like most of Spielberg's films)Some scenes are fuelled by the conflict between the warring nations, others drift along solely on the genuine emotion on show. The scene in which Witt (Caviezel) is surrounded by Japanese soldiers is among the most emotionally affecting I can think of; it never fails to bring tears to my eyes. Such emotional expressions in the film are not rare, with the voice-over ruminations, flash backs to happier days for Ben Chaplin's character and the soulful music adding considerable emotional weight. With generally flawless direction from Malick, beautiful music by Hans Zimmer, gorgeous, lush photography by John Toll (even the gory battle scenes are beautifully done) and some performances that could be described as superb (a few gluttonous Hollywood mistakes are thrown in, but are forgettable, so the film doesn't suffer too badly), 'The Thin Red Line' is my pick for the best war' film ever (if ever pigeon holing a film into a genre was stupid, this would be it), and one of the most poignantly stunning films I've had the pleasure of seeing. Forget the comparisons with Spielberg's film. 10/10",9,0,1,19 January 2003
