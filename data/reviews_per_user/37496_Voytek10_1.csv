The Devil's Advocate," Magnetic paranoia.
","There is something magnetic in this movie, when you watch it on begin, it seems quite real and you feel a bit nervous about the story - is it only about a law ? Couldn't Keanu really choose anything more interesting than this ? But this feeling disappear when you fall in his mind, if you wanna understand it well, it must have been watched with his eyes. Deep into this and be Kevin Lomax, brilliant lawyer, happy husband who suddenly falls in the cave of cynicism and cruel wich is also known as New York. And from this moment don't watch this film, read it between the lines, search parallels about us, our civilization, lost opportunities, faith and image of God - don't try to follow an action just like that - then you would think that's director's insane - only a metaphoric view will give you an answer who we are and where we are going. And believe me, it doesn't look pink.",Null,0,1,19 December 2002
