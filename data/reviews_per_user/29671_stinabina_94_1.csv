The Avengers," Good but also bad
","This was one of those movies I did not feel an urge to watch. I waited until it was shown in the television. I think one will find the movie more enjoyable if one has read some of the comics or know more about the Marvel universe than I. I frankly thought it a bit boring, very nicely made and worth watching, but I have seen better, and the only reason it deserves to be on the top 250 is because of the effects. but even if the effects are very well made, I suppose it also helps make the movie less interesting. just a lot of fighting and flying. it is also as if this movie is not allowed to be serious, always the serious scenes are broken by comedy, sometimes bad humour. That said, it is still worth watching, and it has good scenes and is pretty to watch. But not one I am eager to watch anytime soon again.",6,3,7,14 February 2013
