Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The some sort of underrated volume
","I thought the first volume was great fun, and you can tell Quentin had fun making it too. But to me, Vol. 2 felt a lot more 'complete' and well-rounded than the first one, which was action- packed and quite messy in my honest opinion. Vol. 2, although not filled with action, it was the most enjoyable for me. It was dramatic, beautifully choreographed, and of course well-written. Every QT-movie is well-written, but because this relied less on the action, and more on the dialog, it felt like it was better written too. So what Mr. Tarantino has done here, is quite amazing. He has made two movies, which are one complete story, and belongs together as a whole - but still managed to make two movies in the complete opposite directions. So it all comes up to which mood you are in. If you want something quiet and dramatic, throw Vol. 2 on ... and if you want something that's more action- packed and fun, throw on Vol. 1.",10,5,9,29 March 2013
Coraline," Amazing visual experience and a dark spell-binding story!
","'Coraline' is top notch movie magic, when it comes to creating a near perfect stop-motion animation picture. The animation is exciting, unique and full of life despite the really dark and Gothic tale. The story itself is well-written and really works on the screen (especially in 3D). The film deals with dark adult-like themes and references and it might scare the little ones, so it's defiantly not for the younger audience. Since that doesn't count for me I enjoyed it a lot and was actually blown away by this surprisingly little hidden masterpiece. So please people, open your eyes (or should I say door) and step into a beautiful universe that will capture your heart and soul and fill it with cinematic art at its finest. -Thanks for listening, AB...",10,0,0,10 July 2013
This Is the End," A huge disappointment from talented people with a great idea and a big pile of money
","First off, I'm not just someone who is negative for the sake of negativity. My review is not based purely on my personal view on this, but also the movies content and overall comedic effect from a neutral point of view.'This Is the End' has a lot of great potential to be comedy of the year. The cast and the overall idea for the movie are screaming 'success' at your face! But you should never leave a big bag of money in the hands of two silly and 'stupid' first-time directors. Granted, they're good script- writers and generally have track of what's funny and what is not - but the question is whether they can control the fun? NO is the answer, unfortunately.I will admit that it started out good and I thought that if it just continues to build it from there it can only be good. I was, however, horribly wrong.The film is crowded with stupid overly silly over-the-top sexually explicit scenes, which also run longer than what I thought was ever possible in a movie. There is several over-long almost boring scenes where adults talk about semen, masturbation and rape in very immature ways. Things which are not even funny at the first sentence, is driven out to a three or five minute long scene. How do people find this funny? Well, Americans will hate me for this and probably stop reading after this, but 'typical stupid sex-filled American humor' is what it is.The film did have its highs but most defiantly also its lows. I laughed a lot about four or five times but that was it. The idea was great though but unfortunately not executed well at all.I eagerly await the British competitor, 'The World's End', which will defiantly (or at least hopefully) be a lot funnier than this mess.4/10",2,12,26,15 September 2013
The Hunger Games," What the hell did I just watch?
","Okay Where do I start...This movie (I haven't read the book, so this is a review only based on the movie) was wrong in so many places. It was too violent to be a pre-teen hit, but maybe that was 1 point to the guys side - or maybe not, because this movie also contains the famous Twillight-drama, also known as, the idiotic, stupid, childish 'dramatic' bullshit, which is all over every 'love' scene. We've seen the classics: I-love-you-I-love-you-too // don't-go-stay-with-me at least a hundred times before; and it also worked before. But in this movie I feel like laughing out loud every time those fake love-scenes appear on the screen (just like Twillight).The beginning made it look like it was going to be a movie with the heart on the right place/different kinds of love etc. and then took a drastic u- turn and turned into Charlie and the Chocolate Factory on speed with all those weird costumes, then it turned into a bloodbath!?I suppose it's a boys-movie for girls?.........I give up on this to be honest, the point is it's a bad movie, and the only great thing to say about it is some of the actors performances, a few entertaining moments and Woody Harrelson's bad ass character!",2,9,12,20 April 2012
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," A movie with heart and humor
","This movie is close to perfect, when it comes to a romantic movie, which also succeeds in being funny and witty at the same time, without one of them being too much. I sat down and watched this with my expectations kind of high, after hearing about it, and watching trailers etc.The movie starts off fast and you're captured by the very first minutes. The story throughout the movie is great, and the plot is funny and well-thought. You cannot do anything else than loving this movie because it has so much heart and personality. Sometimes a romantic movie can be too corny or too crazy and too stupid to love. Yes, this is 'Crazy, Stupid, Love' but it has the perfect amount of each of those things to satisfy someone who's looking for a movie to laugh at, love and enjoy.This is without a doubt one of the best romantic comedies in quite a while, so you should definitely go see it, and if you already have, then watch it again!",9,1,2,14 January 2012
Oldboy," Brutally beautiful and anti-Hollywood... I love it!
","I was going into 'Oldboy' with expectations flying in all sorts of directions. I had no idea what this was, although I did have some kind of clue. But I can tell you, as soon as the movie began I knew that I knew absolutely nothing about this film. A film that would turn out to be the greatest revenge thriller ever, crossing the line of what should be put onto film by several miles! Sadistic, nasty, wrong and pure ingenuity!Not only is the main story and theme behind the movie amazing, but also the script as really well written, and the cinematography is some of the best I've come by in quite some time. All the actors are also doing their absolute best to stay on par with the director, scriptwriter and cinematographer. Especially the lead character is completely stunning... What a performance.I can't believe I held off for so long, but I'm glad I finally watched this Korean masterpiece!",9,1,7,13 October 2013
The Others," There's 'The Others', and then there's the others...
","This is the scary movie you're looking for! It has it all: it's scary, it's creepy, it's beautiful, it's mind-breaking, it's everything!When the movie started I thought that it would be one of those movie you watch and forget about afterwards, but it surely proved me wrong. It builds up a perfect story and the atmosphere is amazing. The acting is great, and the ending is the best I've seen in a long time. Yes, the plot has a twist. But it has a twist, upon a twist. You'll site unspeakable and just stare at the screen until the end-credits roll over the screen.There's no doubt, this movie is a success...",9,3,6,20 December 2011
Django Unchained," Amazing Western... Tarantino-style!
","There's no words for how well done this film is. The script from Mr. Tarantino is, as always, a beautiful piece of artwork and you enjoy every bit of wicked and witty dialog - Especially because he's got the perfect actors to complete it. Christoph Waltz showed us all from the very first scene that he masters another great Tarantino- character, Dr. King Schultz a German bounty hunter who set out to find Django (Jamie Foxx) so that he can help him with his next job. Jamie Foxx's Django is spot on! I can not imagine anyone else play this role (and especially not Will Smith, sorry). And Leonardo DiCaprio... This may be his best role yet. He is the perfect villain for this story and Leo in a role like this is more than a joy to watch. And last but not least, Mr. Samuel L. Jackson. Wow, his role is so funny! When I watched the trailer I thought to myself 'what the hell is this' but he defiantly pulled it off!The cinematography is beautiful and really fulfills this masterpiece together with the amazing costume work. I think y'all get it now, THIS MOVIE IS PERFECT. Go watch it asap!",10,1,4,23 January 2013
Tarzan," People need to go re-watch this
","This is one of Disney's absolute finest movies. You may have heard the storyline before, but you have never SEEN it told this beautiful, with movie-magic only Disney can deliver. A well-crafted script, with classic- and controversial themes and beautiful cinematography, that entertain the adult audience, all covered up in Disney's fine animated lines that both children and grown-ups can enjoy. So PLEASE give this another (or a first) watch, because if it stood to me, the rating should at least be 8 here on IMDb. This is movie-magic at its finest.10/10",10,2,3,1 March 2013
