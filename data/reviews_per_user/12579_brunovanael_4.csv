Blade Runner 2049," Slow-mo
","If this movie was just a tad slower it would come to a full stop. I'm sure the director had it's reasons to do this, as I have my reasons to rate only 4 stars. Maybe consider telling the story of your next film in only 1,5 hours?",4,3,7,21 July 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Way too much
","Jurassic Park, The Sixth Sense, Alien, Harry Potter and The Hangover are great movies. Putting all characters, realities and styles of these movies into one would probably result in a hidious thing, and that's what's wrong with this Avenger movie. There's too much of everything. More heroes, villains, battles, worlds, stars and CGI do not make a better movie. I really liked the first two avengers movies wich also did have a lot of heroes, but it had it's own style. This was a mix of everything that didn't really match. Thank god part 2 of this movie wich had a lot more of what Hollywood movies often tend to forget : a story, emotions, a twist, a plot,... That could explain the very high rating here, allthough a clickfarm also could. If I get the chance to see the sequal for free I would, but if I miss it, that's just fine.",5,3,4,21 January 2019
Lucy," Super pitch, but weak ending
","The story has an interesting premises. It was really difficult to understand what the movie was actually about without any background information, but then there was the 'aha' moment. I didn't know where this was going but suddenly I got very interested, and I was not disappointed... at first. But as the percetages rised I stopped getting into the story, with an unfortunately disappointing ending.",7,0,0,1 March 2019
Incredibles 2," Finally a sequel that is super
","This movie met my expectations and exceeded them. Sure, it's more of the same, but then again the first movie was incredible. The visuals had an amazing upgrade though. This is what live action animation should look like : all CGI, but never distracting, overdone (within the movie's context) or mechanical. The story was just as brilliant and funny as part one. Layered, orginal, stylish, with action, comedy, suspense and drama perfectly dosed. To be completely honest the villain felt a tad less threatening because in the first movie this really came out of the blue. The reason why for being a villain was a little far fetched. Anyway, I was expecting the worst as I loved the first and this one is more in Disney's hands then part one was, and honestly... other superhero movies they made really went downhill with every sequel. The avengers avenged! Thank you Brad Bird, cast and crew for regaining my trust in superhero movies!",9,2,3,3 May 2019
