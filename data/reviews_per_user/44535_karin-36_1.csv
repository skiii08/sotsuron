Requiem for a Dream," confusing 'high' art with substance
","I tend to enjoy movies that depict reality, no matter the extremes. However, this movie was way off base. At the start, I was entertained by the cinematography. Enjoyment soon gave way to utter disbelief and disgust. If the message was 'just say no', this was the epitome of overkill. Never have I seen a movie containing such degrading graphic images of women. Even the fancy drug-using scenes became predictable. I would recommend this flick to no one.",3,12,23,16 November 2000
