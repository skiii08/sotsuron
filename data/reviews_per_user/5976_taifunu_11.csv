Mission: Impossible III," better than I expected
","to be honest, I didn't expect much from this movie - especially after MI:2. in the end, I reluctantly agreed to give it a try. and I was surprised, in a good way. Of course, it has all ingredients and features of the typical MI movie. of course there must be a lot of action, adrenaline , suspense, chase scenes..you name it. but this time there was a real plot, also. a main story, and various subplots. mostly the standard clichés, ( the girl/s in distress, the all-times hero, the boss gone evil, the twist - oops, it's not that boss, it's the other one - the jump from the building..you name it) but it came together fine. And Cruise acted unexpectedly good. I mean, he wasn't over-acting. he wasn't yelling half of the time and playing the fearless hero like he did in the previous MI. He was more ..put together. real. credible ( well...sort of) another proof he can really act , if directed properly. ( see 'Magnolia' or 'Collateral') . And for this we must thank JJ. I'm not a Cruise fan, but must admit he made a good role in this movie.",8,2,4,28 May 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Hauting indeed. unique.
","after so many comments, most of them expressing my thoughts better than I could have ever done, there's really not much left to say. only that it haunts me. since I first watched it, two weeks ago. and I keep returning to it. it's almost addictive ! as much as a Faulkner novel. it turned my world upside down. made me watch life differently. a story about love. about choices. about human nature. intolerance. lack of understanding each other and especially oneself. lack of communication. too much love, but fear to acknowledge it, to express it on one side , impossibility to change the fate on the other side...Ennis could have saved them both. or maybe not. we'll never know. and neither will they...makes one wonder. reconsider one's ideas. one's values. one's 'morality'. see life through different lens...",10,19,23,26 April 2006
Watchmen," great sound editing ;)
","I'm watching the movie and I think 'darn, this guy (Snyder) really has an eye for translating graphic novels onto the screen ! he just makes the drawn panels come to life... ... and then I think better about it and realize I'm somehow disappointed. What he did with 300 and Watchmen was to film the drawings, frame by frame... guess I wanted more than that. guess I wanted a re-telling of the story, not just a translation... But it works. it catches the essence of the comics. Maybe Moore should watch the movie. Don't know what he'd think of it, but he should at least watch it. And the sound editing is just brilliant! oh, and people, get over the use of the 'Hallelujah' song, it was a joke ;) :))",8,2,4,18 June 2009
The Usual Suspects," slightly predictable ???
","sorry, I might seem to go against the flow here...but to me, at least, the plot seemed slightly predictable...and towards the last 40-30 minutes of the movie I was just waiting for 'them' to reveal us the 'unexpected' twist ending... don't get me wrong. maybe I've seen too many movies lately. and for sure I've seen this movie too late. but I cannot see it at all now as a breakthrough. more like a more-than-average- suspense-cops-and robbers-movie. yes, the acting is fine. and Kevin Spacey is good in this role. he got some well-deserved awards in 1996, for his role in this movie as well as for that in Seven. no doubts about that, none so ever. but I'm really surprised that it got so many awards for the script. The Academy Award, I won't comment. The academy's got a mind of its own...a profane like me won't even attempt to understand its reasons. But the Independent Spirit Award for best script...original script...come on...could it be that 1995 was such a bad year for movies ??? OK, maybe I'm looking at this from the wrong perspective...",7,2,4,13 July 2006
The Hurt Locker," for once I agree with the Academy... and it scares me ;)
","Finally managed to watch 'The Hurt Locker'. And I say finally because I had to watch it in two 'sessions'. Taking a break of two days between the first hour and the second. Can't explain why. Maybe it was just too much. Too much of what? Sheer film, I suppose. There's something haunting and intense about Bigelow's minimalism - as opposed to you-know-who's pretentiousness and grandeur and megalomania. With Bigelow it's all about details. The bullet shell. The wind blowing the dirt. The hungry, dirty, three-legged cats. The Iraqi boys speaking rap slang. And then there's the mix of shaky camera images, documentary-style, and the 'classic film' shots... I also liked the way Ms.Bigelow teased us, bringing in Guy Pearce and Ralph Fiennes only to kill them 5 minutes after... ;) XD There's probably a lot more to be said about this film, but I can't do it. Can't write about films I really like. Can't find my words. That's why I'll never be a film critic ( thank gods !) Haven't watched the other nominees for 'best movie' , except for 'Avatar' and 'Inglorious Basterds', but I dare say that for once I happen to agree with the Academy. And for those who said this film won the awards it did because it sort of glorifies war - opposed to what Cameron's extravaganza did ; WATCH both films, then think again. Most of Bigelow's films are about a certain part of the human psyche. About the need for the adrenaline fix. The way I see it, that's what 'The Hurt Locker' is about, not war per se.",9,3,10,13 May 2010
Avatar," entertainment ? yes. technical achievement ? yes . but...
","*The first duty of a movie is to entertain.* someone said on a blog's commentary section. and by all gods, Cameron's Avatar does that. pity it stops there  It's a 3D special effects extravaganza. It's a movie written and directed by James Cameron, post-Titanic. 'nuff said. But the characters are sketchy, the lines are clicheistic, and the only one who saves the day, in more ways than one, is Sam Worthington. ( Ribisi is great too, but his part is more of a cameo than a real part ) Strip away the effects and the score and the beautiful CGI scenery of Pandora, and there isn't much to the story. At least not what I ask of a 'good' movie. It's entrancing to watch in 3D on the big screen, yes. But when it ends, I yawned and stretched and felt the need for a coffee. And that was all. Didn't make me want to take a deep breath and reconsider the reality around me. Didn't make me want to buy a ticket for the next show, just to see it again. Didn't make me almost miss a traffic light. Other movie(s) did that. Not this one. 'He's designed it to bring people back to the cinema. [] Jim has always said to me that he wants to bring people back to the movies, and he's a smart enough man for that to be tactical.' Worthington said about Avatar. Yes, the movie does that. It's a return to the glorious Hwood kind of movies. It does bring people back to the theater. But I'm missing that 'something' ... the 'splinter' the first two Terminator movies left in my mind... Roger Ebert likes it, the Academy will like it but it leaves me wanting more. More what ? Dunno. Maybe real quality storytelling over astonishing cinematography? Okay, Cameron lured people back to the movies. Now it's time that someone uses this opportunity and gives them also some food for thought. Not only great visuals and popcorn.",7,0,4,26 December 2009
War of the Worlds," mais ou sont les films d'antan ?
","I was watching a Spielberg movies and yet , in the very same time, was longing to watch a real Spielberg movie. As other comments mentioned, one cannot really believe this is the director who gave us the second, third and fourth degree encounter movies; or Minority Report; or even ET... something is lacking. In fact, so many things are lacking !!! the Spielberg vision. The Spielberg 'hand'. All what was left from his previous movies is the blond-haired misunderstood child who now becomes hysteric and overreacts. A good script. A story well put together. you can name the rest, the list is open. Instead, we have Tom Cruise displaying his usual acting style: running, screaming, and playing the hero for two hours which seem never-ending.... What a pity, Tom !!! what a difference compared to your performance in Minority Report , or Magnolia, or Collateral....you were really acting in these movies....what happened now ? I did not expect to see extraordinary special effects. we have seen to many of these already. But this movie is even worse than Independence Day. That one at least had some humour. Sadly, War of the Worlds is a huge disappointment. Hollywood, please, no more alien invasions, no more dinosaurs, no more sword-and-sandal epics, no more Delta Force actions, no more disasters and tragedies(we see too many of them on CNN and Real TV, thank you very much). How about some real movies ? about real people, real life, real small-time everyday average lives of ordinary people? like the good old movies of the '80s and '90s ?",3,2,3,24 July 2005
Speed," actually...it has become a 'classic' !!
","I enjoyed it then, and I enjoy it now. In the meantime, 12 years have passed by, leaving the mark on the movie business, on the world, on the actors, and on us. The movie business evolved in somehow a different place, the world is, sadly, a much unsafer place, two of the leading actors got together to make a new movie, and share the same on-screen chemistry, and we are here, older and hopefully wiser, to enjoy all of their movies...'Speed' can be now considered a classic, but its value is not only in being the 'standard' action-movie. It has a humor of his own. the short lines, or one-lines. the typical situations for the early '90s. the genuine white American girl of the west coast. the not-so-bright cop ( who, by the way, turns out to be rather underrated by his colleagues, as it's he who has the 'hunches' 'gut-feelings' and unconventional ideas, not his partner or chief ), the ex-cop gone mad... ans speaking of which, am I the only one who thinks Dennis Hopper's acting was a little (more) cartoonish ? and that Jack is not the standard hero character ( as opposed to Die Hard or various movies of the kind )? K. Reeves' acting might be considered mediocre by some, but in my opinion he was right for this movie. one of his major qualities is that he's never overacting. there's something calm and detached about this actor, that surfaces in any of his roles... And the best part of this movie is that it's never taking itself completely seriously. It has various layers of humor, and most of it it's actually self-mockery, somehow... yes, the action-pace is fast, the explosions are great, most part of the dialogue is rather witty, but you kind of expect Keanu to turn around and wink at you, like 'it's only a movie'. It's an easy, entertaining movie. there's a certain 'naivete' about it. which makes one - me, at least - watch it over and over again. oh, and the soundtrack is absolutely wonderful...",8,0,0,12 June 2006
Munich," ' home' . a sacred word.
","I kept postponing viewing this movie. Don't know why, just a feeling. And today seemed like the right time to see it. or maybe I was on 'thinking mode'... To be honest, I didn't expect to much. Actually, I didn't expect anything. But I was impressed. Spielberg redeemed himself. I almost forgive him for War of the Worlds. 'Munich' is a well-written, well-acted, well-cinematographed, well-made movie. It's a story about history, politics, manipulation, human feelings , the definition of 'home'... 'home' a sacred word. yet defending one's home means sometimes loosing one's humanity. and one's home means other's exile...as for the Israeli-Arab conflict...it will never stop. but that's a different story, which belongs elsewhere. the message is simple, though : violence will only generate more violence.",8,0,0,9 August 2006
The Replacements," definitely not a gem, but...
","...then why do I keep on returning to it ? I've seen it on TV a couple of years ago. Then one month ago , looking through Reeves' filmography, I remembered it. Bought the DVD, and just can't stop re-watching it rather often. and I wonder why...it's not only the soundtrack. not only the clichés. not only the oh-so-predictable plot. actually, if one has seen a few sports movies , already knows the whole plot/action/scenes in advance... maybe it's the simple and enjoyable fun... OK, not the most intelligent type of humor, but at least it's got its moments... and the whole cast is just too fit for the movie. a good antidote against the everyday problems of life. at least in this movie somebody gets a second chance. it's not intelligent, but sure is entertaining.",8,4,5,21 June 2006
The Thin Red Line," I'm speechless.
","...after watching the movie, I just sat on the chair, staring out off the window, for a long time. all kind of thoughts ran through my mind, but none could take shape. I couldn't even cry. so this is the human nature. at its best and worst... it's a sublime movie. and a terrifying one. oh, the images...the soundtrack..the performances...the story...the overall picture... some complained that it's too long. well, this is not a standard movie. he could have left it 9 hours long, for all I care. I would have watched them nevertheless. this is real art, at its best... but other posters have said it all, a long time before me. nothing more to be added, I guess...I would dare say that in a way it's better that T.Malick didn't make too many movies. 'cause maybe they might have been more than we could take.",10,2,5,23 July 2006
