The Sound of Music," Great movie for the whole family
","This movie is about a family (Von Trapp) living in Salzburg, Austria just before WW2. Maria wants to be a nun, but this is clearly not the type of life that she's meant to live. Captain Von Trapp is a widower with 7 children and is having difficulty finding a governess who wants to stay (the kids run everyone else off). At first, the kids try to make Maria leave by playing pranks on her, but they quickly find that she's different and like being with her as she finds fun things for them to do (something their father has not done), and the Captain also considers her special. To everyone's surprise, Maria disappears during a party. I won't say anything else about the plot (that's for you to find out).The movie is great for the whole family if you like the older movies, especially musicals. You wouldn't find a new movie like this classic (entertainment has changed a lot, and many people living today were born after WW2 ended). The music and storyline make it more re-watchable than many movies I've seen, some of which I don't care to see more than once or twice (but I might become tired of this movie if I watched it every week or every month, as a few people say they do).",Null,2,8,3 October 2013
Cast Away," Excellent movie - Very touching
","Cast Away is one of the few movies that I had watched multiple times. It begins with Chuck (Tom Hanks) who works for FedEx and is always rushing around the world and living by the clock, often against his girlfriend's wishes. At Christmas he is called to travel to Malaysia to solve a problem, just before he can pop the question. He promises to return, but a storm and resulting plane crash change his life forever.While on an uninhabited island for four years Chuck lives on his own, learning survival skills during this time, with Wilson (a volleyball) as his only companion. Despite his situation, he has hopes that one day he will escape and return to his family and to Kelly. After building a raft, he manages to escape the island, but loses the companionship of Wilson (the only friend he's had during his time on the island).When Chuck finally makes it back to society, he encounters problems just as great as the ones he had on the island, finding that no one was as loyal as Wilson (Kelly has married someone else, his family held a funeral a while back, etc). Once again, Chuck is stuck on an island, but on an emotional (not physical) one, since everyone has left him behind. At the end of the movie, he is left at a crossroads, having to decide where he will go to start a new life.",Null,0,0,14 March 2013
Ben-Hur," A great movie for history and old-time action scenes
","I recently watched this movie again after not seeing it for many years. It was a history lesson in a way, showing the brutality of the Romans, conflict between Rome and nearby nations, a chariot race, and well-known characters from the era (such as Pontius Pilate and Jesus). The action scenes are quite interesting, especially the chariot race - Remember that it wasn't as easy to do these back when the movie was made (no CGI during the 1950's). There are also a lot of themes in the movie (such as love, hate, death, healing, sadness, joy). The movie is long (more than 3 hours), and there are moments without much action, but I never felt bored while watching it. The movie is best appreciated by someone who knows about ancient Rome and Judea, and their culture (if you don't know any of this information the movie will be difficult to understand).",Null,1,3,6 August 2013
The Wizard of Oz," A classic film for people of all ages to see
","I recently watched The Wizard of Oz again after not seeing it for a while. It is interesting to see how a movie made back then is still appealing to so many people, and as an adult (I was introduced to the movie as a kid) I can see how some songs like 'Somewhere Over The Rainbow' are still recognized by many people, if not as well-known as before. It is also quite common for the movie to be featured in trivia, and when watching it again I noticed how it's made an impact on our culture (I've heard the expression 'you won't melt' before, there's a small street named 'Yellow Brick Road' in my town). The Wizard of Oz is showing its age (you can tell everything is painted, special effects we're used to seeing in newer movies weren't invented yet, and the entertainment style is old-fashioned). I've noticed a drop in the number of people who know this movie and some of our other classics like The Sound of Music (a movie made during the 1960's that has a story set during the late 1930's), but unlike other 70+ year old movies it hasn't been forgotten.",Null,4,6,10 October 2013
