Requiem for a Dream," Ellen Burstyn is amazing.
","Maybe the Academy Award voters saw something I didn't, but Ellen Burstyn's performance in 'Requiem for a Dream' was far and away more impressive than Julia Roberts' in 'Erin Brockovich.' Now, don't get me wrong, Julia was good, but Ellen Burstyn is absolutely brilliant as Sara Goldfarb. It's one of the best performances I've ever seen.This overwhelming film is supported by great visual/ audio techniques, an unbelievably powerful score and inspired acting from the entire cast. This is not 'the feel-good movie of the summer,' so be forewarned. If you're anything like me, you'll be left stunned after the gut-wrenching climax.Director David Fincher said he's not as interested in movies that entertain than movies that scar. This is a movie that scars.10+",10,1,1,10 August 2002
Fargo," Real good, now. (how it didn't beat the 'English Patient,' I'll never know)
","I really enjoyed this movie. The story and the plot are not all that crazy (compared to a lot of movies, I mean), but it's the actors and the very simple people they portray that make it so enjoyable. To these simple, Minnesota folk in the movie, the story and the premise is pretty crazy. Seeing how all of them react to the kidnapping and the ensuing mishaps is great fun.The Coen brothers are so amazing for their ability to bring us into people's lives we aren't used to seeing in other movies. I greatly admire their work and their courage to tell stories they want to tell. They had to know that some people would be turned off by the movie (a notion supported by some of the angry reviewers on here), but they really don't seem to care. I'm glad that this movie garnered them critical claim. Despite the 'English Patients' Oscar win, it was the best movie on 1996.",10,0,0,4 August 2002
