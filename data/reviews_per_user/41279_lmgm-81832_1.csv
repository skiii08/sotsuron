Blade Runner 2049," Transported
","I went to Bladerunner 2049 with some trepidation and lots of hope. As a devout fan of the original Bladerunner, I was so hoping this would not be a rehash of the old and offering answers that I did not want or need.Within the first moments I was hooked. It was not a remake, nor was it trying to copy the darkness of the original. Instead a smoggy 2049 appeared, reminiscent of the feel of the original in a way that only paid homage, with music, sets, effects, costumes...I did not feel the length of the film. I was immersed in the story, and I feel that this movie can also stand on its own due to that story. The acting was superb - restrained, refined, and full of depth. This is not a superhero or action film, it is a thriller and mystery wrapped around a miracle. This will not appeal to everyone, whether fan of the original film or not. But for this movie-goer, I could only say, as we left the theater, 'Can we see it again?'",10,1,9,22 October 2017
