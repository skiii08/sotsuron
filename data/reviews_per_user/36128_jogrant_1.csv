Minority Report," way out there
","I recognized scenes from Episode II (right down to getting the hand caught), Fifth Element, Wild Palms, even an episode of Murder Most Horrid, and quite a few others but I won't be pedantic listing them off . . .
Despite this, I liked the movie because I found the plot innovated on already existing ideas (been floating around Sci-Fi novels and television for quite a while now) in a visually pleasing and smart way.The people I went with didn't get the part about precognition or whether Agatha caused people to do things...  I suppose the development might have been a bit clearer since outside the USA the idea of ESP is not really taken seriously and so not assumed by the audience the way it might be in the states.My main criticism is that the one of the spiders seemed to be rather a lot smarter than the others.  If there are standard units that shouldn't happen, and if they are AI then their activity should have been more varied.",7,0,0,6 October 2002
