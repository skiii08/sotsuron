Blade Runner 2049," Visual Phenomenon
","In the plot department, the Blade Runner sequel isn't always smooth, logical or innovative, but its jaw-dropping, breath-stopping visuals will keep you glued to the screens and will make you lose yourself in its realm at some point. With this film, Denis cemented his reputation of a visual genius, and I do hope that the film will get Oscars for its dazzling visuals and soundtrack. It's imperative to watch it in 3D on as big screen as you can find. I know very few films if any, where every frame is captivating to the extent where film's universe seems more real, palpable and desirable than your own. I much appreciate that the director built up this feeling gradually, giving time to get used to this bleak, near-dead world, increasing tension in the second act, and completely engulfing and hypnotizing the viewer in the final parts. Scenes where K finds Deckard's refuge are visually and stylistically and musically so perfect and absorbing that I borderline had tears in my eyes from the sheer perfection of them. Nothing felt out of place, not even digital Elvis, black&white Sinatra or a shaggy dog, each being a Character as critically important and full-fledged as K or Deckard. Now, how is this possible? This film isn't flawless plot-wise, but visually-wise, it's phenomenal.",Null,2,11,6 October 2017
