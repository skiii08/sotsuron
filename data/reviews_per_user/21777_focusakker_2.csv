50 First Dates," High Anxiety's Review of 50 First Dates
","All right, all right, all right!! Greetings, Anxieteers around the world! They call me...High-yo-yo-yo-yo-iii Anxietyyyyyyyyyyyy! And I'm here to tell you about Adam Sandler and the Anxie-luscious Drew Barrymore in 50 First Dates. Let the games begin! Adam Sandler plays Henry, a fish boy by day who becomes a player by night, for Drew Barrymore, a.k.a. the girl from Scream who got killed by Ghostface, entered her life. But there is one condition in Lucy's life, Anxieteers. The poor Anxieteer has short-term memory loss and can't remember her life. Spirits of the Underworld, why have you abandoned her? Anyways, Rob Schnieder made a cameo that all female Anxieteers should enjoy. My mom's friend, Jen Leone, enjoys this flick, for she loves romantic comedies.Until next time, this is High Anxiety reminding you, always have your memory ready for you when you go on a date. So long, Anxieteers!",6,0,0,15 May 2006
Casino Royale," My name is Bond. James Bond.
","Hello, everyone. My name is Whifflebottom. Xandir P. Whifflebottom. Let me tell you about Casino Royale, one of the best James Bond films to date.Bond (Daniel Craig) is the world's most dapper spy, on a mission to save the world from bad guys. He has a sexy partner, played not by Rachel McAdams or Charlize Theron, but by a stupid sissy named Eva Green.So, has anyone found Rachel McAdams? BONG! BONG! BONG! BART! LISA! TIME FOR CHURCH! I'll take that as a yes.Anyway, in the words of Midnight Rider, let's try to remember Rachel McAdams not as a Bond girl, but as that sexy woman who became a bride and was involved in a plane hijacking.And has a boyfriend.And has a boyfriend. Yes, we'll never forget that, will we? Open your heart-I got a load of big shoes to fill. Big shoes to fill. Big shoes to fill.Anyway, Charlize Theron is exciting not as a Bond girl, but as an assassin named Aeon Flux. She descended as high distances.JFK, blown away! Who is to teach us to fly! Fly, of course! Fly! Ninepence! I'm not dead! Legally Blonde. Sally Ride. Rachel McAdams is a bride. Davy Crockett, Peter Pan, Elvis Presley, Disneyland! Rachel McAdams is not with James Bond. She is a serendipitous blonde. She plays a bride in a movie, you see. Keep your 40, I'll just have an Earl Grey tea!I gotta go, everyone. Sayonara.",7,0,7,30 September 2007
