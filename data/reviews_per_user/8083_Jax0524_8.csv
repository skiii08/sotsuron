Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," I heart Pirates
","I've been keeping up with the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise since the beginning in 2003 with POTC:Curse of the Black Pearl. I loved Curse of the Black Pearl absolutely loved it.Soon after that Dead Mans Chest was released and I thought meh okay not as good as the last one but still a decent watch. Then came the bomb that was POTC: At Worlds End. At Worlds End was a big mess. There was too much going on and the plot was just all over the place.It got to a point where I didn't care about the plot anymore Im strictly watching for the effects now.As for Stranger Tides I was impressed. This film reminded me why I fell in love with Curse of the Black Pearl. I wouldn't even call this movie a sequel it feels like a whole new beginning. Will and Elizabeth's story is over and now we get Jack and Angelica.Did I miss Will and Elizabeth? NOT AT ALL. I stopped caring for those two a long time ago. Im glad their story is over and IT IS OVER FOLKS. For a time their story was interesting and then I gradually started to get bored to tears with them. So yeah good riddance moving along.The plot of this installment circles around the fountain of youth. Jack Sparrow(Johnny Depp)runs into Angelica(Penelope Cruz)a woman from his past. Its not entirely certain if its love and she wants to follow him to the fountain of youth, but then her intentions become clear when she forces him aboard the Queen Ann's Revenge, Black Beard's ship. Ian McShane's portrayal of black beard was pretty convincing I have no complaints about that. However my complaint lies within how the writers were trying to shove down the audience's throat the fact that Blackbeard was evil. For example there was a scene where Blackbeard, Jack, Angelica, and the crew are all standing over the edge of a cliff and Blackbeard orders Jack to jump. Jack refuses and Black beard says that if he doesn't he'll kill his own daughter, who just so happens to be Angelica by the way. It then cuts to an unnecessary scene of Black beard and Jack playing a game of 'pick a gun any gun' Two of the guns contain a bullet whatever gun Jack picks Black beard will shoot Angelica with it just to prove a point.Why was this needed. At this point the audience pretty much knows that Black beard is a bad guy. Im sure it wouldn't surprise us if Blackbeard threatened to kill his own daughter.This wasn't necessary, it did nothing for the plot.Another complaint I have is that nothing is really explained about Blackbeard making people into zombies or the magic of his ship or why he has an interest voodoo.The movie really picked up when the mermaids came. This was one of my favorite parts of the movie because it has a calm before the storm feel to it. You meet these beautiful captivating creatures that lure the pirates into false sense of security and in a way you yourself feel hypnotized as well. There's a lot of tension in this scene and you know something is going to happen, your just sitting there anxiously waiting for it to happen, and then comes the boom. They may look lovely but they are definitely deadly beauties. Which brings me to the whole Phillip and Syrena love story. It didn't bother me however it did feel a little forced.I wouldn't even call what they had 'love' it was more so infatuation. The interest was there it just needed more time to develop and thats hard to squeeze in the last 30 to 45 minutes of film. If there's a POTC 5 I wouldn't mind seeing Philip and Syrena again just to know what became of him. But for the most part I think their story is finished. We may never know what happened to Philip. But I must say I would most definitely want to see more mermaids.In conclusion I was satisfied with this movie. The beginning was pretty slow and boring but it began to pick up towards the middle and end. Its definitely a good reminder of why people like pirates.",8,8,12,25 May 2011
Underworld," Best scifi fantasy vampire film I've ever seen
","I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. After seeing other vampire films like the Blade trilogy or 30 days of night I was really disappointed with them. It was hard for me to find an enjoyable vampire/werewolf movie until this came along then I decided to give it a shot. I was happy with it, I really liked the idea of vampire vs. werewolves. When I saw this film I had no interest in Kate Beckinsale what so ever although she was fun to watch kick butt on screen. Unfortunately there were some problems that I had with her character Selene and Scott Speedsman who plays Michael Corvin, which I will talk about momentarily. I was more interested in the characters Viktor (Bill Nighy), Kraven (Shane Brolly), and Lucian (Michael Sheen). Lucian was my favorite I sympathized with him way more than any of the other characters on screen. Even though in the beginning of the film we get the impression that Lucian is the bad guy; as we get further along in the film you begin to realize that he is in fact the hero and a victim. You understand his reasons for doing the things he does. I was really interested in learning more about Lucian's past so I was really happy when Underworld Rise of the Lycans was released but thats another review.Now here come the things that I hated. First off let me just say that I absolutely can't stand when the writers of a film try to force a relationship between the two main characters in a film. I can't stand it. A perfect example of this would be Neo and Trinity from the matrix films and this one. Usually when I watch a film and the writers decide to throw in a love story I have to ask myself this one specific question What are the characters reasons for liking each other? what do they mean to one another? If this question isn't answered then we have a problem. The relationship between Michael Corvin and Selene in this film was so rushed and forced that I didn't believe for a second that these two were so into each other not to mention the character Michael was so undeveloped it was ridiculous. it was hard to even call him a character he was more of a plot device, there was nothing to really like about him. Michael and Selene fell in love because the plot needed them to, there is no attraction between these characters. Having the two main characters pointlessly hook up only gives the writers the excuse to write a pointless sex scene in the sequel(see Underworld Evolution).Other than this I thought this was a really good film. Its a movie you would watch on a rainy day when there's nothing else on TV.",8,1,2,8 July 2009
The Hunger Games," The Hunger Games: a review from a spectator
","I wanted to read the book first before going to see the movie. I enjoyed the book with a few complaints here and there but overall I enjoyed it. As for the movie it was a great adaptation. While a few things were changed from the book it didn't really bother me as much. One scene that was altered for instance:SPOILERS: The character of Madge was removed completely from the story and originally it was written that Katniss received the Mockingjay pin from her. In the film they made an interesting change and switched it so that Katniss had given the pin to Prim and then later Prim returns the pin to Katniss as they say their farewells. To me it made it all the more poignant and I preferred this as opposed to the way the Mockingjay pin was introduced in the book. So that was a good change.END OF SPOILER.The casting choices I thought were great. Jennifer Lawrence plays a terrific independent,headstrong, Katniss. What I liked about her character is that she is strong but its almost to the point where she is cold but with good reason. She is first and foremost a protector, provider, and survivor. You get that she has to be hard,she guards herself from emotion and doesn't attach to people easily because to her its a weakness. Because she's such a hardened character it can be difficult to like her at times.SPOILERS:Josh Hutcherson was great as Peeta. The romantic aspect between him and Katniss was taken down a notch and I appreciate that because in the books I felt it was just too much. As the saying goes 'Less is more.' Simple a lot of the time is usually better. We don't need the director making these two kiss each other every few minutes just to show the audience just how much in love these two are, fake or not, Which is what I felt Suzanne Collins was doing in the books. In the film their relationship felt pretty ambiguous you couldn't really make heads or tails of it was it real? was it for show? For those who read the books already know the truth but I'm glad they left it the way they didWoody Harrelson great Haymitch. Almost exactly how I picture him in the book.Stanley Tucci, loved him as Caesar Flickerman. I swear every time that man cracked one of those exaggerated smiles showing all 32 of those big white teeth I just burst out laughing. Loved him.Now for some negativesI liked the character Rue, unfortunately I wasn't able to get invested enough in her character to feel sad when she died. It was sad but not THAT sad. I will say though that I like her chemistry with Katniss just by the simple gestures you could tell how Katniss was reminded of her twelve year old sister. But I knew the role of Rue's character before I even read the hunger games. She's the character you kill off to let everyone know how sick this game is and how evil the capital is, but just to make it worse lets make it a twelve year old. Almost as if Suzanne is saying are you angry now? But after she died the scene that followed was awesome, Katniss doing the 3 finger salute to the people of District 11 (Rue's hometown) and then the revolt that followed was simply moving and I did about 10 fist pumps when that happened.And lastly,fire the cameraman because honestly what the hell was going on? was he having a seizure? That camera was all over the place even when the shot didn't require any action that stupid camera was moving. It was awfully distracting.Overall I say go see this movie. Its enjoyable. Though the camera might be distracting the story is good. I also don't get this comparison between the Hunger Games and Twilight they're not the same. This movie had a plot and I would pass up Twilight to see the Hunger Games any day.",8,0,11,24 March 2012
Troy," One of the best period pieces I've ever seen
","What could I possibly say about this movie that hasn't been said already by the millions of others who also loved the film. This movie was absolutely mind blowing from the acting all the way down to James Horner's fantastic musical score. I can honestly say I probably never wouldve even seen the movie if I hadnt read about the legend of the Trojan War, I found it fascinating. I even managed to read the Iliad and I will admit that even though the film does not stay true to the iliad it is still an awesome movie. It really makes me mad when Homer fanatics bash the movie simply because it wasn't made the way Homer depicted in his story, but if you pay attention closely the movie says 'inspired' by Homer's the Iliad meaning the story motivated its director to do a film about Troy it doesn't say 'based' on Homer's the Iliad, then it wouldve been considered inaccurate. So its unfair to say that Wolfgang did a terrible job with this movie simply because it was 'inaccurate' The character I felt attached to the most was Achilles, not because it was Brad Pitt but because I kinda felt sorry for the guy. I will admit he is an arrogant self-centered a**hole but throughout the movie you begin to see another side of him. One of his lines that stuck with me was when Briseis asked Achilles why he chose the life of a great warrior and he simply replies I chose nothing I was born and this is what I am. A guy that spends his entire life fighting and doesn't really know what it truly means to live.Even after he killed Hector, as angry as I was, I could not help but pity him. I think Achilles was searching for something far more than just glory in battle and by the end of the film I think he found it. I think Achilles had the most character growth in the entire film",8,4,8,25 June 2008
Underworld Awakening," A start something new
","I am neither disappointed nor completely impressed by this film. The film was short but it was very fast paced which made up for that. But overall I felt like I was watching a prologue to a possible 5th underworld film. Kind of like the opening intro in Underworld Evolution. I went with my brother and as we watched it he asked me with extreme sincerity 'when was the movie going to start?' and I was feeling the same way.That doesn't make the film bad it just felt unfinished to me.There was a lot of worry over Scott Speedman not being in the film. Quite frankly I didn't care either way. I don't care for Speedman's character, Michael. I didn't care about him in Underworld, I didn't care about him in Evolution, and I still didn't in Awakening. As a character he's a disappointment. In Underworld he just served as a plot device and a forced love interest for Selene.There was all this talk in Underworld about this ultimate creature, a hybrid (vampire and werewolf)and once we get it, its pushed off to the side like a piece of furniture. Michael was supposed to be this bad ass force to be reckoned with and yet Selene still overshadowed him. His character is so under developed that I cant bring myself to care about anything that happens to him.I like Kate Beckinsale's Selene, absolutely love her character. Now I know I just stated that I don't care about Michael. Let me rephrase: I only care about Michael because Selene does. Even though Im not a strong supporter of their relationship, because I like Selene I wanted her to find him and get him back.I also get the reason why Michael wasn't in this film because they were trying to establish the mother daughter relationship with Selene and Eve and for Michael to be there it would disregard that aspect. So Im cool with that. Selene also feels more emotional in this one as well which I liked. You get a sense of her realization of her connection with Eve and this new feeling of having to protect her at all costs.Unfortunately we never get any explanation of how Eve came to be. Selene is captured one day and put in a cryogenic prison and 12 years later poof there's Eve. We're left with only speculation that Selene was pregnant at the time of her capture or Eve could possibly be the genetic splicing of Michael and Selene's DNA, a clone, an alien. hell,we don't know. But just go with it.I hope if there's another installment that we will expand more on Eve's character. I would hate for her to get pushed off to the side like her daddy. She was such an awesome character and they could definitely start a whole to franchise with her.",7,4,9,22 January 2012
Revolutionary Road," This ain't no titanic folks
","After finally seeing revolutionary road I have to say I was immediately blown away, Leo and Kate definitely delivered the goods I was mostly surprised at Leo's performance to be quite honest especially with him playing the role of a father and husband for the first time. He was phenomenal he brought out emotions that I've never seen him do before especially towards the end and his final confrontation with April, calling her a 'cold heartless shell of a woman' and at the same time you can tell that he is absolutely hurt and crushed as he starts to break down in tears, it was both frightening and heart wrenching.Kate Winslet was absolutely fantastic, I found myself in the end really sympathizing with April throughout the film a little bit more so than frank. April is a woman who wants something different out of life and refuses to give into conformity and is willing to escape it at any cost. She comes up with the impulsive decision to move to Paris and convinces frank that they should go, Frank agrees but due to unforeseen circumstances(April getting pregnant)Frank changes his mind and decides to take the raise that is given to him at his job at Knox. Of course April is extremely disappointed to the point of which (I think) she becomes a little bit of a sociopath. It becomes even more apparent when Frank openly tells her the truth about his affair with his secretary and she simply responds 'why did you? no, I don't mean why did you have the girl I mean why did you tell me about it?, is that supposed to make me jealous, or back into bed with you?' There are times in this movie when you just want to call April a b***h but at the same time you feel sorry for her. the same can also be said for frank, he's sleeping with his secretary and yet you understand that he only wants to do whats right by his family and make his wife happy.Michael Shannon who I think represents the truth of this film was excellent as well he plays the role of Mrs. Givings ill son who spent time in a psychiatric hospital. His character as 'crazy' as he might seem to be he is the only character that bluntly puts the truth out for everyone to hear even if they don't want to hear it, especially when it came to his confrontation with frank as he tells him he may have knocked up his wife on purpose as an excuse not to go to Paris.There are a few questions that did pop in my head afterward like, ' did frank really want to go to Paris?, did he purposely get his wife pregnant to avoid moving to Paris?, would the wheelers truly had been happy in Paris?'. My only complaint about the movie is the ending, it could've been much better, it also bothered me that Frank and April's children rarely were present in the film.Overall I give the film a 9/10 and I recommend this to anyone",7,3,7,26 December 2008
Titanic," A classic epic drama!
","This movie may be the cheesiest film on the planet but I loved it!!! I don't know if I can express in words how great this movie is. All I can really say is this is a film that you will want to share with your grandchildren. I will admit there was a corny line or two especially on Leo Dicaprio's character and in my opinion I honestly thought Kate Winslet out shined Dicaprio even though Dicaprio did have his share of great moments in the movie. I really loved Jack Dawson but I just felt that his character was almost too one dimensional. When I first saw the movie I thought it would be a load of crap... boy was I wrong I was so entranced into the love story that I totally forgot that this was TITANIC so when the iceberg showed up I found myself sort of praying against all logic that somehow titanic would miss the iceberg, I even remember leaning to one side of my seat thinking if I did this the ship would miss lol. and of course when tragedy struck and the ship was sinking I was really caring for Jack,Rose and all the other passengers and even then I kept thinking maybe it will stop sinking and these poor people wont have to die. Throughout the rest of the film I was in complete utter shock I don't even think I blinked. even when Jack died I was in disbelief and in my head I was screaming along with rose for jack to wake up. The only time I cried in the film was at the very end of the movie when you see the titanic morphing into a new and pristine state and you see all the passengers inside greeting rose as she comes in then Jack extends his hand to her and they share a passionate kiss and everyones clapping, I was uncontrollable and the tears just kept coming. I thought it was perfect to end the film on such a bittersweet note and that music playing in the background just made my heart flutter. This is a movie you must see before you die!",8,3,5,11 May 2008
The Proposal," One of the best romantic comedies I've seen in a while
","I usually don't like romantic comedies. I cant stand them for the reason that they are so predictable. Its like if Hollywood is running out of film ideas they settle on a romantic comedy because its safe territory.I wanted to see this because I love Sandra Bullock and Betty White so I gave it a chance. Apart from this films predictability it is rather good and I honestly have nothing negative to say about it. It was cute,funny, charming, and romantic. I was entertained all the way through. But like many romantic comedies I personally would not pay to see this in theaters, this is definitely a 'rent-it-and-watch-it-with-your-significant-other' kind of film. Overall good movie one of the most decent romantic comedies out there.",9,1,2,7 November 2009
