National Treasure: Book of Secrets," The poor man's Indiana Jones.
",The National Treasure movies are the poor man's Indiana Jones. Who's scared of Ed Harris. Indiana has to deal with Nazis and Soviets. Cage's character only faces a few semi scary moments in the movie. If the movie producers decided they need to pump another bore fest; they should pump up the action and at least gets some crazy terrorists Nicholas. Shooting RPG's at Cage and his crew should be sufficient with maybe a couple road side bombs going off would be much better than 'scary' Ed Harris chasing Cage around the Globe. Even Marty McFly had to deal with some terrorist after Doc sold some terrorist a fake bomb made of pinball parts for Delorean. The idea is good; the view is just expecting a bit more and a little less fluff.,6,0,0,18 June 2008
