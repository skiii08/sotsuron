The Blair Witch Project," scary, more eerie
","Seeing 'Blair Witch' again after a few years, I found it easier to view it on its own merits.Quick synopsis:  three students hike into the middle of nowhere to make a documentary on a piece of local folklore.  They become hopelessly, desperately lost.  The realization of how screwed they are slowly sets in as they begin to suspect that they are being stalked by something sinister and unseen.  The film itself presents itself as the doomed student's own video footage of their documentary.The primary factor is to keep in mind the difference between 'horror' and 'terror.'  'Terror' is sudden, blood-soaked threats of bodily harm that jump out at the heroes, and unfortunately is all most 'horror movies' deliver. 'Horror' is dread of unseen and horrid possibilities, carefully cultivated by a thoughtfully-crafted situation.  'Blair Witch' is rich in horror.  It has some terror but it's fairly lean and carefully employed.  This may disappoint some viewers, especially if they have very high expectations and/or are accustomed to schlock.  If you want to see a movie starring a special effect, look elsewhere.Anyway, 'Blair Witch' does have a long build-up, but it does reward those who pay attention through the first quarter of the film.  It will provide you with the depth of the story that is not explicitly laid out for the viewer later.  Most importantly, it does become more creepy in the context of the movie.The jiggling camera is somewhat dis-orienting in parts, but is put to good use in drawing the viewer into frantic and confusing scenes.  Also, the film might have less impact on you if you feel very at home in the woods, or if you have little sympathy for the characters.  Horror is, after all, subjective.There are several scenes which are overtly scary, and still made me jump. However, the best part of the movie is the strong build-up from frustration to desperation, from desperation to dread, and from dread to screaming panic.  When the credits roll you'll be left with the adrenaline of the high-energy scenes.  A while later, it's the eerie implications of the build up to those scenes that sinks in...  Usually late at night, when you're by yourself.  Now that's horror.Regretfully, 'Blair Witch' is an experiment that shines in its original concepts, but lags in some of its delivery.  If you can tolerate the actors and cope with some dragging pace, you'll find it a refreshing take on the genre.",9,0,2,18 November 2001
Resident Evil," sometimes the formula works
","'Resident Evil' is true to both the spirit of zombie movies and to the console game it was based on.  If either of these criteria drew you to the film, chances are you were not expecting a profound exploration of the human condition anyway.  The film delivers precisely what it promises.  This movie is a bloody exposition of special effects and super-models with fire axes. If neither appeals to you, stay at home and read Dickens.Beyond this, 'Resident Evil' relies heavily on tried-and-true formulae for the horror and action genres.  Things jump out.  There are loud noises. Blood gushes.  We have close ups.  We have slow-motion.  The plot twists aren't exactly the end of 'Usual Suspects.'If any of these things bother you, then the volume is too low and it isn't dark enough in the theatre.  Subjecting 'Resident Evil' to a cynical criticism of its stock elements is like drinking your beer warm and then complaining because it tastes bad.  Accept that this is not Hamlet, and enjoy 'Resident Evil' for its loud and expensive applications of horror/action traditions.  It's sleek for a zombie movie and very good for a movie made from a video game.  8/10.",8,0,0,22 March 2002
