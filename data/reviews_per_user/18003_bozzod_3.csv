Iron Man 3," The Tony Stark Comedy Hour - Spoilers
",This is not an Iron Man movie. Tony is in the suit for maybe 15 mins tops. Most of the movie is slapstick and RJD throwing out one liners. There are so many things wrong with the movie. No building tension as none of the attacks are on screen. You only see the one incident at the theatre caused by Happy. It would have been better to see escalating attacks around the globe and a building threat. The Mandarin was a total throw away after building up the Ten Rings over 2 movies. Maya was a wasted character. She would have been interesting had she been Tonys first love who came back and caused friction between him and Pepper. Instead she was a one night stand and there was no emotional weight to her heel turn. It was ridiculous that Tony had 40 sets of armor but the only one available to him during the attack on his house was an experimental model that didn't work. In addition he then spends the next hour of the movie investigating without functioning armor. Really? He has no armor at Stark Tower? Very disappointing movie.,4,3,6,19 May 2013
Hereditary," Another Hyped Let Down
","I had no issues with the basic premise of the plot. The execution was the big let down. 
-A mother wouldn't send her awkward almost autistic 13 yr old daughter to a party with her 17 yr old brother.
-Brother accidentally gets sister killed in ridiculous fashion, auto accident and no cops involved?
-Mother has a break down and never taken to a hospital/psych ward.
-Son has a break down and injures himself w/no hospital/psych ward visit. Sure he may have a concussion but who cares.
-Father so concerned for his son but doesn't leave with him or make mother get help.If you can make it through to the middle at least the ending is somewhat creepy.",5,3,8,9 September 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Real Review from Spiderfan
",So the 1 rating is to offset all of the fake '10' greatest movie ever reviews. This is truly a 6/7. The movie is aimed squarely at the tween/teen audience with a grating urban contemporary soundtrack. This has little to no connection to the actual Spider-Verse series. The story they came up with was acceptable. I liked the interaction between Miles his father and uncle. Not all of the humor hits. They chose some of the lamest spiders from the Spider-Verse. Especially bad was the manga spider and Spiderham is less cartoony in the comics. Did not like the Kingpin voice or portrayal and every other villain such as Tombstone is just wasted. The movie had heart which elevates it over common kiddie animation. Not even close to the best Spider-Man movie.,1,87,274,17 December 2018
