","Best Bond ever? No because it is not Bond at all.Bond is back? Which Bond and from where? Again: No because it is not Bond at all.Good action movie asides from what one thinks of Bond? Hardly, it is unevenly paced and insecurely directed. it starts fine, but comes apart rapidly. The scenes in Scotland are downright boring.The people who say 'What is this - mission Impossible 5' are right, because this is not James Bond at all. Despite some obvious production value (placed in polishing stuff that is completely average otherwise - except for the really well choreographed opening), it is not especially classy, and as action movies goes it is only just about average. Certainly not above in any way.I didn't think Casino Royale was 'real Bond' either - but that WAS at least a good movie. Quantum of Solace was 'Bond as a British jack Bauer', and it just didn't work.This looks mostly like Die Hard 5 with a Bruce Willis AND a director who should both have retired.Would give it a five if it didn't pose as a Bond movie. But posing as a Bond movie it fails. Utterly.",1,36,72,7 November 2012
