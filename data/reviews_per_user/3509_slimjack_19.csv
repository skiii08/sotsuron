Catch Me If You Can," What would you do?
","What if you were a teenage kid, fast on your feet and possessing the gift of gab?  What if you found that by wearing the right suit and faking some checks you could fly wherever you want, buy cool cars and get the sort of women here-to-fore only glimpsed in the pages of forbidden men's magazines? Would you say `Get thee behind me Satan'?  Would you go back to church, sing in the choir and date plump little Suzie from down the street? Nahneither would I, and neither did Frank Abagnale Jr., the `hero' of Steven Spielberg's Catch Me If You CanIt's the early 60s and Frank is a teenager in need of an escape. His beloved Dad's a crook, his French mom's a floozy and impending family bankruptcy has forced Frank out of his pricey private school and into the public school system. What's a boy to do but impersonate a teacher for a week to show the world what-for? The success of his prank coupled with a chance encounter with an airline pilot shows Frank a rather questionable solution to his problems. Soon Frank, resplendent in a filched Pan-Am uniform is caging rides on airliners, cashing forged paychecks and scoring with the Stewsjust the type of therapy a mixed up kid needs. How this appealing young bunko artist is both brought to -and given a measure of - justice is the narrative thread of this absorbing fact based movie.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank as a bright, relatively normal kid who discovers natural talents well suited for a life of larceny. DiCaprio does an appealing job playing the character for simplicity and truth rather than the big effect. Tom Hanks plays Agent Carl Hanratty, the dogged FBI agent charged with catching Abagnale.  Crusty to a fault but possessing a well-hidden streak of compassion, Hanratty battles both Frank and an FBI for who check-kiting is not high on the list of glamorous crimes.
One of the strengths of the movie is the way DiCaprio lies.  The problem with most movies involving conmen is that their cons are usually enacted with a wink and a smile. Because the grifters come across as transparently phony their marks seem imbecilic to fall for them. Not so in Catch Me If You Can.  Frank Abagnale moved among intelligent professionals who knew much more about the subject he was lying about than he did. Frank would have had to prevaricate with complete conviction to pull off his con. DiCaprio captures this. Despite the fact we are in on his game, when Frank passes himself off as a pilot or cop we half believe him ourselves. The marks have no reason not to believe him.  With Catch Me If You Can Spielberg is not straining for a blockbuster or trying to `hit one out of the park'. As a result the picture feels relaxed. Spielberg has an interesting story to tell and he delivers it like a master raconteur.  It may not unseat Titanic at the box-office; it may not win a string of rewards. It does keep you constantly entertained, makes you care about Frank and Hanratty and gives you a sense of time well spent, an important feat in my book.",Null,0,1,30 January 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," That rare bird, a decent modern pirate movie.
","Pirate movies have fallen on hard times as of late.  There hasn't been a decent one since the mid-fifties.  Attempts to revive the genre have generated a series of expensive flops like Cutthroat Island and Roman Polanski's Pirates.  Despite the dismal track every ten years or so there is yet another attempt to get it right. With the latest, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl persistence is rewarded. Though not on a level with Captain Blood or The Crimson Pirate, Curse is still is a thoroughly enjoyable movie that successfully combines modern action with a traditional sea saga.The Black Pearl is a ship with a cursed crew doomed to an undead existence until they return all the Aztec gold they unwisely pilfered. After years of ghostly plundering they manage to gather all save for the one piece currently in the possession of the beautiful Elizabeth, the Royal Governor's daughter. Can her true love, the pirate hating blacksmith Will, keep her safe from the crew's boney clutches?  Or does she need the help of the completely loony Captain Jack Sparrow?Sparrow is a hilarious addition to the Hollywood Pirate tradition. He is a seadog sure to strike terror into the hearts of the fiercest scallywag though not because of his dazzling swordplay.  Johnny Depp plays Sparrow as if he has downed one too many grogs on the way to the gay pride parade. He flounces, weaves and mumbles his way about the Caribbean absolutely sure that he is the very model of a modern pirate captain. That his adversaries aren't as sure of his seafaring abilities as he is doesn't register in his hazy worldview.  Depp's Belle of the Poop Deck routine works fabulously. He gives the movie a pixilated charm but if it's an old fashioned shiver-me-timbers pirate you want there is Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa.  Rush `arrhs' it up for all he's worth and even makes you feel a little sorry for the murderous old sea dog.   As Depp and Rush keep the glorious tradition of ham acting alive others in the cast are left struggling to keep up.  While Orlando Bloom seems stogy as Will the insanely beautiful Keira Knightley is in no danger of being overshadowed.  Her Elizabeth comes across as the most competent character in the movie. You get the feeling she could have sorted the plot out quicker without the blundering help of Sparrow and Will.  The rest of the cast is filled with a great assortment of character actors who fill out their colorful parts nicely.  In fact, it's safe to say it's the performers who make this movie despite the extensive special effects on display.Curse suffers from the usual modern summer blockbuster problems what with frenzied editing, sloppy plotting and a leaden approach to comic timing. Complicating matters is an out of control sound design.  Background creaks, booms and clangs are blasted out of proportion and every footfall thumps like a brontosaurus tread. All this drowns out the actors so potentially funny lines are lost.  Art direction is also problematic. For example, the skeletal crew is so stuffed with detail that between the quick cuts and frenzied pace they come across as a perambulating blob.  A further drawback is the cinematography. For some reason the normally sunny Caribbean looks as bleak and cold as the North Atlantic. While all this is annoying it shouldn't stop you from seeing Curse. It's a charming movie filled with the sort of enjoyably preposterous performances you rarely see nowadays.",8,1,2,30 May 2004
Finding Nemo," A lively and beautiful summer treat.
","Fish. How the heck do you make a movie about fish? Fish are good for hooking, cleaning and frying but to make an animated adventure about them? Seems like a long shot to me. Luckily for us Pixar Studios took up the challenge and made the computer animated Finding Nemo.  This is an astoundingly beautiful, touching and very funny movie aboutahfish. 
The plot of Finding Nemo is simple.  In a comparatively tough opening scene (for a children's movie) clownfish Marlin loses his wife and all but one of their thousand-odd eggs. The surviving egg hatches to become the titular Nemo, a feisty little fry suffering under the watchful eye of his overprotective father. One day Nemo feels particularly put upon and swims off into dangerous water.  Naturally he is captured by divers and soon finds himself captive in a fish tank. Thus begins Marlin's quest to find and save his son.  At first glance, this looks like standard kiddy movie fodder. Dangers are faced.  Fears are overcome and (big L) Lessons are Learned. The sort of pabulum parents dread sitting through and kids quickly tire of.  For the most part though Pixar successfully navigates the shoals of the mundane. They fill Finding Nemo with enough fascinating details and humorous asides that you forget you've seen essentially the same movie a hundred times on Nickelodeon.  From the dental groupie denizens of Nemo's fish tank to the single-minded seagulls the movie will snag even the most adult viewer's attention throughout. The first thing that hits you in Finding Nemo is how gorgeous the movie is. The undersea environment simply ripples with color, texture and detail, especially in opening scenes set in a crowded coral reef. Traditional cell animation cannot begin to compete with computer animation in this area. 
Pixar has always been extraordinarily clever in casting the voices of their features and Finding Nemo is no exception. Albert Brooks, an actor known for his neurotic roles, is perfect as the driven father fish Marlin. Willem Dafoe as Gill, Nemo's fish tank mentor, is every old con that ever led an escape attempt. Barry Humphries, usually heard and seen as Dame Edna Everage, sounds exactly like what you'd expect a talking shark to sound like. The featured voices include Eric Bana, Bruce Spence, Elizabeth Perkins, Austin Pendleton, John Ratzenberger and Geoffrey Rush among other - all perfectly cast and all fitting their animated counterparts perfectly. The standout performance, however, is Ellen DeGeneres as Dory the bluefish. She steals the show as Marlin's enthusiastically helpful companion with an unfortunate memory problem.  Finding Nemo does have its faults. Some sequences are played at such a frenetic pace it becomes hard to sort out what is happening. In particular Marlin and Dory's encounter with a trio of over-friendly sharks suffers from a too frenzied approach.  If I hadn't read that they had stumbled into a Meat-a-holic Anonymous meeting I would probably have missed the joke. This, however, is a relatively minor blip in an otherwise consistently delightful film. With its wealth of humor, vibrant color and stunning attention to detail Finding Nemo is well worth a viewing on the big screen.",Null,0,0,11 June 2003
Constantine," No Lutheran Vampires, darn it!
","Watch enough horror movies and you can be forgiven for thinking that the Reformation never happened. Just once I'd like to see a Methodist demon though I'd settle for a Lutheran vampire or two. Unfortunately - or fortunately depending on your point of view - the new supernatural action film Constantine does nothing to further the protestant cause. It is firmly rooted in the gaudiest Catholic mythology with more Latin, holy water and crucifixes than in all the churches of Rome. None of it is taken seriously mind you. Thousands of years of tradition and belief are gleefully misused, misquoted and misconstrued in the service of a senselessly gory and violent movie. That it's a well made and entertaining slice of hokum probably won't cut much slack for Constantine's creators in the hereafter.It seems that God and the Devil made a bet a millennia ago as to who could win the most souls to their cause. Points are taken off for direct supernatural meddling. All the rules allow is a spiritual nudge or an earthly temptation here and there, but someone is not playing by the rules! Demons are finding their way to earth and an ancient, incredibly holey artifact is about to fall into the very worst of hands. It's up to John Constantine, PI and freelance exorcist, to expose the demonic conspiracy. Unfortunately he has terminal lung cancer and is facing damnation due to a botched suicide attempt. It would be a short movie if it weren't for the pretty cop who seeks Constantine's help in solving the mystery of her sister's suicide. Further stirring the pot are various holy and unholy notables who make their agenda and themselves known as the plot progresses.Constantine cries out for a tough guy lead. Like Bruce Willis say, or Samuel L. Jackson. Instead we have Keanu Reeves. In truth Reeves is not all that bad. He plays John Constantine strait, drawing humor and pathos from the character's jaundiced world view and hopeless position. Unfortunately Reeves lacks the charisma and physical presence a rough, world weary demon hunting PI might be expected to have. On the other hand Rachel Weisz is great as the conflicted cop. Emotional without being overly weepy and believably tough she seems entirely capable of handling her supernatural problems without Constantine's help. It's too bad her character devolves into a standard woman in distress. Pruitt Taylor Vince makes so much of his part as a slovenly priest we become more intrigued by him than we are with the main plot line. Tilda Swinton is righteous and more than a bit creepy as the angel Gabriel. Finally there is Peter Stormare as Satan. Funny, frightening, and truly alien, his is one of the best devils ever put on film.Despite unholy cadres, heavenly hosts, visions of hell and all matter of supernatural jumbo jumbo Constantine feels more like a film noir than a supernatural melodrama. To John Constantine Satan is just another corrupt Mr. Big trying to muscle into town and God and His angels are an unreliable and suspect city hall. As the movie takes its tone from its hero's attitude it is more suspenseful than horrific. Constantine's pleasures derive from the way its detective movie roots collide with the supernatural overlay. The movie does a fine job treading this line without falling too far into parody. Park your brain at the door and enjoy.",9,0,5,16 March 2005
The Day After Tomorrow," A solid, entertaining disaster movie
","The Day After Tomorrow is a workmanlike disaster movie that takes its premise seriously but not so much so that it fails as the light entertainment it is meant to be.   DAT doesn't so much avoid the cliches of the genre as uses them intelligently. Director Roland Emmerich captures the good, old fashioned fun of cinematic catastrophe while avoiding the melodramatics that mar movies like The Towering Inferno and The Poseidon Adventure. The movie opens with a large chunk of the Antarctic ice cap falling into the ocean.  Scientist Jack Hall witnesses the event and, with the help of a computer model designed to study ancient weather patterns, predicts that global warming is going to cause a new ice age.  In fact it soon becomes clear that the climate reversals that Hall thought would take a century or more are occurring at a vastly accelerated rate.  Within days the Northern Hemisphere is beset by biblical disasters and glaciers begin galloping southward.  It is at this point Hall heads off for frozen New York to save his estranged son. Critics have sneered at this, citing ersatz family drama as a disaster movie cliche.  The critics would have been right if situations like these were used for campy histrionics.  Instead DAT makes a smart choice. Rather than have the cast emote frantically the movie leaves the theatrics to the CGI technicians.  As a result the quiet tragedies the characters face stand out in relief against the cacophony of disaster that surrounds them. Dennis Quaid shines as Hall, the heroic scientist and absentee father. His intensity and utter seriousness keep the role from being consumed by its own cliches. Ian Holm is his usual memorable self as a doomed Scottish meteorologist and Kenneth Welsh gives his wrong headed US Vice President more depth than called for.  Jake Gyllenhaal and Emmy Rossum are fine as the endangered son and his love interest.  Together they avoid what could have been sappy pitfalls and managed to inject a little humor into their predicament.  DAT fulfills its apocalyptic premise by giving you all manner of spectacular destruction.  Tornados, blizzards and tidal waves rip across the screen with all the wild abandon one could wish for.  Is it all convincingly real? Nope. Not at all.  In DAT they have to ravish the whole Northern Hemisphere on essentially the same budget that powered just one hurricane in Twister. Exacting realism just isn't in the cards. So, instead of quality, the movie goes for imaginative quantity. You are treated to the sight of three twisters tearing the heart out of Los Angeles, a wall of water cleansing the dirty streets of New York, a tanker floating down Broadway and the Statue of Liberty waist deep in a snow drift. The Day After Tomorrow has become a lighting rod for undeserved criticism, most of it lambasting it for having the audacity to be a disaster movie. This is something like cursing the sky for being blue.  So be warned, if you don't like disaster flicks DAT won't change your mind.  You might even think twice about spending eight dollars to see it. But it is worth matinee prices to experience the spectacle on a wide screen.  If it sounds like I'm damning this movie with faint praise I'm really not.  DAD is an enjoyable movie that does its job well. If disaster is what you are in the mood for you cannot go wrong, just don't expect it to shatter your senses.",7,1,2,19 June 2004
Zodiac," A good police procedural but a poor psychological study
","The Zodiac was a serial killer active in San Francisco during the early 1970's. Unlike others of his kind, the Zodiac loved publicity and courted it religiously. He sent letters and coded messages to newspapers and police. During one killing he wore a complicated hood and cloak costume with his zodiac symbol emblazoned on the front. Another murder was done simply for the press and to tweak the cops. Horribly he got away with all this. The Zodiac killer was never caught. Because of this Zodiac the movie combines a police procedural with a study of the psychological effects the fruitless search had on its participants.Zodiac tries to concentrates on two individuals, Robert Graysmith, a political cartoonist who becomes obsessed with the killer and David Toschi, one of the cops assigned to the case. To appreciate the psychological toll obsession takes you have to come to know its victims. Despite the movie's long running time we never get that close to Graysmith or Toschi. Part of this is the actors fault. As Graysmith Jake Gyllenhaal is a cipher. He never seems any more than an amiable young man and his inner life remains something to be guessed at. Mark Ruffalo, as Toschi, is a better actor than his compatriot but his part is written as standard TV cop fare. Toschi resembles an amusing Columbo clone rather than a real cop with twenty five years experience. Another hindrance in understanding these two is that we simply don't spend enough time with them. Zodiac must have a hundred speaking roles with an array of secondary characters that easily outshine the leads. Robert Downy plays Roger Avery, a reporter assigned to the Zodiac case, as a smart-alec hipster undone by the '70's drug culture. Brian Cox plays flamboyant criminal lawyer and part time actor Melvin Belli for all the parts worth, which is about every stick of scenery within his reach. As a suspect John Carroll Lynch seems normal but just creepy enough to give one pause. Charles Fleischer outdoes Lynch on the creepy scale as a source who may be more than he seems. These characters flit in an out as the case rises and falls, all drawing attention away from Gyllenhaal and Ruffalo. It becomes increasingly clear is that Zodiac isn't really interested in their characters. The movie would much rather dwell on the search for and identification of the Zodiac Killer.It is as a police procedural that Zodiac shines. The facts of the case are clearly, almost lovingly delineated. Or, more accurately, Zodiac gives a very complete illusion of delineation. For Zodiac is compelled to give us the killer in a famously unsolved case. Yes, this is the suspect Graysmith and many of those involved with the case truly believe to be the killer and Zodiac is careful to point out the evidence presented is circumstantial. There can be, however, a huge gulf between what a movie pays lip service to and what it implies dramatically.It must be remembered that Zodiac is based on a book by a man whose psychological health depended on finding the killer. A multi-million dollar movie also has a need for closure. A police procedural needs a conclusion to proceed to. Otherwise you leave your audience frustrated and a frustrated audience is a small, unprofitable audience. Bear that in mind as you watch Zodiac. As informative as the movie is, distrust its conclusions. The real Zodiac was never caught. No one was prosecuted. Everything else is, at best, informed conjecture. Keeps this thought close and you will find Zodiac fine, thought provoking entertainment.",8,7,14,13 March 2007
We Were Soldiers," An old-fashioned war movie with all the strengths and failings of the genre.
","We Were Soldiers is based on the true story of the first major battle between American units and the North Vietnamese army. Mel Gibson plays Col. Hal Moore, the man tasked with leading the 7th Air Cavalry. This was the first battalion created to implement the new helicopter strategy that would become the signature of the war. These tactics are still in use today, as witness by Black Hawk Down for instance. The movie was written and directed by Randall Wallace. While not as stylish as some directors he tells his story simply and coherently. Wallace includes some unique touches.  We actually meet the North Vietnamese and while we don't really get to know him or his men, at least we get some sense of them as soldiers.Wallace does make some mistakes.  The soldier's wives somehow don't come across.  Part of the problem is their costuming.  Their hairstyles and clothing are too-too early sixties. They look like east village drag queens having a retro party rather than concerned army wives. Madeleine Stowe plays Julie Moore. Stowe is a fine actress but something weird happens with her character. For some reason, just as the character should become more vivid she begins to fade. I don't think this is Stowe's fault. I tend to think Wallace was more interested in the battles than he was in the home front and the soldier's wives suffered for it.In the end, one's feelings about We Were Soldiers is defined by how one feels about Hollywood war movies.  Because it is a star driven film we have the pleasure of a great Gibson performance and Elliot's Sergeant Plumley. We pretty much know who's going to die and how.  The conventions help us make sense of a difficult battle that is presented very close to the way it actually happened. The downside to this is that, as close to the facts as the move is, it doesn't feel all that real. You experience it as a smart, thoughtful action movie instead of getting the sense of intense horrifying reality that you got from Black Hawk Down. If you're bothered by the idea of war as entertainment, you will have some trouble with We Were Soldiers. As for me, I enjoyed it and give it a hearty recommendation",8,2,3,29 March 2002
Blade II," Delivers fast and gory atmospheric action.
","I don't know what's gotten into vampires lately.  They use to be such a genteel and refined bunch.  Well dressed. Intelligent conversationalists. All in all, a satanic monster you could bring home to Mom.  Nowadays, vampires dress like bikers, swear like dock workers and take a chunk out of your neck without so much as a by-your-leave. Dracula would be rolling in his grave if it weren't for the stake.  As the vampires get rougher, so do the vampire hunters. The ascetic, professorial Van Helsing type wouldn't last a second in today's undead environment.  We need a shotgun welding, sword fighting, tattooed warrior of the night. Enter Mr. Blade. After the fine Blade I, he returns in the superior  if unimaginably titled  sequel, Blade II. It's crammed with style, action, flamboyant acting and twocount em, two kinds of vampires!  Let me tell you, you get your moneys worth with this movie. There is a new kind of vampire in Budapest called The Reapers. They are so unmitigatedly evil that even Anne Rice would be repulsed.  Normal means of vampiric elimination won't work with them.  They laugh at garlic, gargle holy water and use wooden stakes for toothpicks. Their Achilles heal is that blood is more than sustenance for them; it is a crack-like drug that they must constantly imbibe or die. To defeat this menace, the old guard vampires reluctantly join forces with their scourge Blade. Of course, bloody mayhem ensues.  In fact, there are times when Blade II resembles a baroque anatomy class. Gore this extreme is usually a mistake as it has a tendency to anesthetize the audience.  The director, however, knows what he's doing. Guillermo del Toro shoots the bloody business with all the attention to mood and atmosphere that a Val Lewton or a James Whale would bring to a classic Universal horror movie. Blade II is never too campy or so strait as to be depressing.  The action is fast, furious and genuinely exciting.  There were a few problems here and there, though. Blade and company have obvious computer doppelgangers for some of the more unlikely stunts. Also the fights were interspersed with professional wrestling moves that struck me as clownish. The rest of the audience, however, cheered every flying knee drop that cropped up. The cast is pretty high rent for a movie like this. You'll have as much fun watching the actors do their thing as you will with the action and special effects. Wesley Snipes does Blade perfectly. He plays the part dryer than a martini, yet with just enough swagger that we know he isn't going for a serious character study.  Kris Kristofferson's Whistler is the best cantankerous old coot since Star Trek's Doctor McCoy. Ron Perlman is excellent as Reinhardt, a really hard-case vampire none to pleased to be working with Blade. Luke Goss is completely repulsive as Nomak, the lead Reaper. Great work all around. Blade II is not a movie for the faint of heart. The violence is bloody, extreme and graphic and all that gore is there simply for your morbid pleasure. No social relevance. No comments on the human condition. Blade II is an old-fashioned exploitation flick dressed up with all the wiz-bang bells and whistles of modern movie making. It's grand fun while you are watching but you may hate yourself for enjoying it.",9,0,1,29 March 2002
The Aviator," Soars on Psychosis but Fails Elsewhere
","The dichotomy of Howard Hughes' spectacular rise and epic fall has fueled sermons, books, plays and even an opera. Artists, academics and theologians have found all manner of signs and omens in his story. The Aviator chucks most of this in favor of a glamorous psychiatric case study. You could say The Aviator is A Beautiful Mind gone Hollywood without Mind's inspirational spine. In fact the greatest strength of The Aviator is the tale of Hughes epic struggle for his sanity. When the movie meanders to other concerns, such as his Hollywood dalliances or his business struggles, it loses focus.The Aviator assumes the audience has a familiarity with Hughes and his world. If you don't know he died a wizened gargoyle after years of madness and seclusion much of the impact of the movie will be lost to you. The Aviator follows Hughes' life from the late 1920's to the 1940's from the start of his production career and ending with the first and only flight of the Spruce Goose. Director Martin Scorsese stops short of showing us the wreckage of Hughes' final years to let our collective knowledge add the requisite shadow over the glamorous proceedings of the film.The Aviator is hampered by bad casting choices starting with Leonardo DiCaprio as Hughes. DiCaprio is a gifted actor and he does a splendid job suggesting Hughes' genius and creeping madness. However DiCaprio cannot summon the weight or authority needed to play the ruthless tycoon Hughes becomes. His scenes in front of a Senate sub-committee are particularly bad. He comes across like a sophomore sassing the dean. Cate Blanchett, as Katharine Hepburn, fares worse. Her resemblance to Hepburn is minimal at best and she does not begin to approximate Hepburn's vocal rhythms. While Blanchett gets better towards the end when she all but drops Hepburn's mannerisms, in total her performance was distracting. The actors in less recognizable roles fare better. Particular standouts were John C. Reilly as Hughes' long suffering factotum and Ian Holm as a beleaguered meteorology professor.Hughes' business rivals are portrayed as outright villains, which is indicative of the curious take the film has on Hughes' career. The Aviator posits the incredibly rich and autocratic Hughes as a proletarian rebel who takes on 'The System' and beats it by being brilliant, brave and handsome. We even have a scene where Hughes, after spending millions like water, lectures Hepburn's eccentrically aristocratic family on the value of money to those who have none. While it strains credulity to hear the future darling of the Nixon administration wax Marxist, the shocked look on the horrible Hepburns is undeniably satisfying.The Aviator is one of those films best appreciated on the big screen. It is an absolutely gorgeous movie. The flying scenes in particular are spectacular and the crashes horrific enough to make us understand their effect on the already unstable Hughes. While The Aviator may not be on par with the best of Scorsese, the power of Hughes' tragedy is exceptionally well delivered and serves to drive the movie through its occasional doldrums.",8,0,1,7 March 2005
Resident Evil," Pretty good for what it is.
","Resident Evil is an action movie dressed up as a zombie horror flick. It has pretensions to being in the same gory category as George Romero's classic Day of the Dead.  In fact Romero was originally slated to direct Resident Evil. He left the production and a fellow named Paul Anderson took over. They made the right choice.  Anderson made a nifty joy ride of a movie with nothing in its brainless little head than to help you waste ninety minutes.
Resident Evil is the type of movie where momentum trumps plot. This is not to say that story is unimportant. You need enough substance to involve the audience in the mayhem but not so much that they will accidentally start thinking. This movie has just enough characterization to make you worry about the fate of the actors and just enough plot to give them something to do.  Something goes `Horribly WrongT' at a vast underground biological research facility. All the lab personnel die and provide a pool of hungry zombies.  A crack paramilitary commando squad goes in to find out what happened.  That's about it for the plot.  That's all you need, really, to string the action sequences together.  Okay, yes, there are some subplots involving corporate espionage, love and betrayal but most of that just gets lost in the noise.  All you have to know to enjoy the proceedings is that the good guys have to go from point A to point B without becoming hors-de-oeuvres.The acting rises to the occasion but not much farther.  A fellow named Colin Salmon does look like he's destined for better stuff.  Salmon plays the head commando and manages to stand out in his brief screen time. Milla Jovovich, on the other hand, never seems anything more than the glamour puss she really is.  Not that she gets much help from the script or costume department.  Now bear in mind that these zombies are suppose to be highly contagious. One scratch and you're a shambling mess. Ms. Jovovich, supposedly a highly trained security expert, goes into battle wearing a spaghetti-strapped purple mini dress. I suppose the thigh high Doc Martins provided some protection but still.anyway, Jovovich has a likable screen presence and does the requisite kickboxing moves with passable flair.
Michelle Rodriguez, now, looks as if she knows one end of an Uzi from another. She does go into battle wearing Kevlar but the ancient rules of dramaturgy being what they are; she eventually takes it off so we can see her t-shirt. To be fair, Rodriguez does a good job.  She shows more personality than Jovovich and is believable in a highly contrived situation.
Despite the zombies you can watch Resident Evil without gagging on your popcorn.  Gore is not Resident Evil's bag. The zombies here are a civilized lot. They do their feeding politely off camera. Yes, there is plenty of blood being splattered around but not much more than you'd see in your average Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.Resident Evil is one of those borderline movies that are fun to watch but don't bear much discussion.  Should you see it?  Well, if your favorite movie of the last ten years was Room With A View then there are other films you should see.  If you're in the mood for a swiftly paced, brainless action flick however, then you can't go wrong with Resident Evil.",6,0,0,29 March 2002
Seabiscuit," A well told tale
","Seabiscuit is the true story of how a small, crook-legged thoroughbred became a champion and one of the fastest horses ever to run a track.  It is also the story of how this horse brought healing into the lives of three stricken men and became an inspiration for Depression struck '30s America. Sounds a bit gooey, doesn't it?  I mean, just add Shirley Temple and you'd have a movie capable of tripling the national glucose level.  Don't let the description scare you. This is an excellent movie that won't rot your teeth.One of the strengths of Seabiscuit has been criticized as its main flaw. The film is paced at an amiable ramble rather than a gallop. It takes its time, gives each character a leisurely introduction and lets the viewer soak in the depression era period. The movie trusts that its story is strong enough to hold the viewer's attention. It must be said, however, that if you don't think the adventures of a loveable car salesman, a crusty horse-loving bum and a half blind kid entertaining you might find the first hour or so before the introduction of Seabiscuit rough sledding. Look at it this way, while the set-up might seem long and slow, when you get to the racing sequences you get a huge payoff for your investment. Not only do you have the thrill of watching Seabiscuit's rush to glory, because the movie takes its time in introducing you to the protagonists and milieu you appreciate what the horse's success meant to these men and the country.The only criticism I have of Seabiscuit is that it feels remote at times. It takes a reserved, glossy approach to the subject matter. The 1930s come across as a beautiful museum exhibit with everything lacquered to the highest possible sheen. As much as I loved the look I couldn't help wondering if the actual thirties horse track atmosphere weren't a bit more ragged around the edges.The acting is somewhat of a mixed bag. Jeff Bridges plays Charles Howard, a man who achieves all he could wish for and then experiences the worse of personal tragedies. It is he who buys the unpromising colt and gives him the chance to succeed. While Bridges has played the go-getting businessman before he doesn't bring much depth to his character this time around. He has the car salesman side down pat but stumbles when suggesting Howard's emotional scars. Likewise Tobey Maguire, playing Seabiscuit's hard-knock jockey Red Pollard, doesn't begin to embody the scrappy youth Pollard must have been. Like most of his generation of actors Maguire is better at summoning emotional moments than building a character. While we buy him as an emotionally damaged yet determined young man it is very hard to accept him as a jockey.  While both Bridges and Maguire are likeable in their roles they rarely seem more than the movie stars they are. Not so Chris Cooper. Cooper plays horse trainer Tom Smith, the strange loner who brings out the champion in Seabiscuit. Cooper is fantastic. You'd swear he'd wandered onto the set after spending a lifetime riding the high plains with only horses for company.As undeniably fun as explosions, car chases and shootouts are, there is something about seeing a movie that actually boasts characters and a plot. Seabiscuit tells a fascinating story that truly earns its emotional moments.",8,0,0,19 August 2003
Ghost Rider," The Rider Has Yet To Shine
","The Ghost Rider is a super hero who never quite hit the big time. He has a great premise though. Motorcycle stunt man Johnny Blaze runs afoul of the Devil and is cursed to become the Rider, a demon who lusts only for vengeance. Clad in black leather, his head a blazing scull, sitting astride an infernal Harley, the Rider is truly an evocative image. He had his own comic, was canceled, resurrected, failed again and generally puttered in and around comic book limbo for years. Nevertheless he garnered a coterie of fans, one of whom was actor Nicholas Cage and so the Rider has been given a shot at shining on film as he never had in comics. Unfortunately he suffers the same fate in the theater as he did in print. Great concept. Great look. Mediocre follow through.Like most comic book movies Ghost Rider is part origin story. We see Blaze make his pact and his first forays as the Rider. We learn the Devil creates him because he needs a hit man. There is more than one fallen angel out there and they are all gunning to take down the big man. In stark contrast to the supernatural power plays we also experience the touring stunt show milieu of Johnny Blaze, with his poker playing blue collar buddies, hick fans and motorcycle minutia. All this is great cinematic stuff yet Ghost Rider can't make it click.The problems start with the acting. Ghost Rider may be Cage's baby but he is too old for the part. Fifteen years ago, perhaps, but now he's just too mature and weathered to believably play a guy named Johnny. Hampering matters further is Cage's habit of striking hokey Elvis poses, rendering Blaze ridiculous just at those moments we should care about him. Gorgeous Eva Mendes plays Blaze's girl. Though winning in Hitch, here Mendes exhibits little spark. She makes absolutely no connection with Cage romantic or otherwise. The Devil is blandly underplayed by Peter Fonda but his infernal rival's fair worse. When the lost angels fell to earth they passed through a trailer park and took the shape of the rednecks that dwelt there. In other words, the Princes of Hell are an unimpressive lot and the Rider earns little respect for his victories over them.A movie like Ghost Rider can survive casting snafus but what it can't survive is the dimensioned of its premise. While the Rider is truly a wonder of CGI and everything his beleaguered fans could hope for, the movie takes this impressive creation and thrusts him into situations designed for humor rather than awe. As a consequence the Rider is never as terrifying as he should be. Finally, fatally, the poor Rider is not even the most impressive creature in his own movie! What could be more impressive than a flaming skeletal biker? How about a flaming skeletal cowboy riding a fiery horse? One played by Sam Elliott no less. This infernal cowboy is so striking and the casting so right that it further diminishes our interest in the nominal anti-hero.In the end Ghost Rider is not a particularly bad film. It hangs together, has its fun moments and Mendes is very, very pretty. All of these are important considerations in a popcorn movie. Still if you are a fan of the Rider, or just have an affection for off-beat entertainment, you can't help but wonder if there weren't a better way to utilized such a cool concept.",4,0,1,3 March 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," An outstanding, if not totally enjoyable, movie
","Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers continues the monumental achievement of The Fellowship of the Rings. It is an intelligent and tasteful fantasy epic. That said you might find it a movie you respect more than enjoy. Watching it can be a distant and cold experience. You seem to be viewing the romance and adventure through a frosty blue lens. The Two Towers is the second chapter of a trilogy that makes little concession to those who come in late. You are thrust into the middle of the action as Frodo and Sam make their way to the cursed land of Mordor. Aragorn and his party track the Orc band that kidnapped Pippin and Merry at the end of The Fellowship of the Rings. Two and a half hours of high fantasy mayhem later you are again left dangling  but not before meeting enough characters to populate ten normal sized movies. This brings up a point: While it is not strictly necessary to read Tolkien's books or watch the first movie to enjoy The Two Towers, such preliminary preparation will help keep your Éomérs separate from your Éowyns and Éothains. 
The Two Towers cast is, again, led by Ian McKellen as the durable wizard Gandolf.  McKellen's exceptional performance does not steal the movie; rather he is like a star quarterback leading a winning team to victory. Most all the actors were memorable up to and including the computer generated Gollum. The exceptions were, unfortunately, Elijah Wood and Sean Astin as the heroic hobbits Frodo and Sam. Their rather bland performances and wandering accents diminished the impact of Frodo's quest to Mordor. That quest is, after all, the backbone of the trilogy. This is not a fatal flaw as the other performances and the sheer spectacle of The Two Towers is more than enough to carry you through the few dead moments.
Spectacle the Two Towers has in overflowing abundance. Magical and fantasy elements seem to play more of a role here than in Fellowship of the Rings so you have swooping dragons, giant walking trees, huge armies of hell-beasts and a castle assault the likes you've never seen.  The siege of Helm's Deep could have been a movie unto itself and is the undisputed highlight of The Two Towers. The epic promise of magical fantasy is realized here but, do to the uniform strength of the cast's performances, all the blood and thunder on display is not at the expense of the characters or their story.	 Director Peter Jackson does have some chinks in his style. He has yet to develop a flair for epic movie making. It sometimes seems that his sole way of showing off the size of his movie is with great swooping helicopter shots. Other times he sprints his camera through intriguing environments too quickly to get a real sense of the scene. He also indulges in some topical comedy that, while undeniably funny, is gratingly anachronistic and has the effect of momentarily rousing you from the mood the rest of the movie has carefully built.  These, however, are small problems that barely scuff the surface sheen of The Two Towers. A larger barrier to truly enjoying this movie is the afore-mentioned remoteness of its style. This may be more a matter of personal taste than anything else.  To me the cool and formal presentation was a little off-putting. To others it might strike just the right note of grandeur. There should be no argument, however, that The Two Towers is a film to be reckoned with and that the cinematic Lord of the Rings trilogy will be judged as much a classic as its literary forbearer.",Null,0,0,27 January 2003
Million Dollar Baby," A Movie to Admire More Than To Love
","Million Dollar Baby is not a boxing movie. It is a character study. Now Rocky was a boxing movie. A poor young kid with 'heart' gets a shot at the title, becomes a contender and triumphs over all the odds. Rocky's journey to triumph was the whole point of the exercise and that is what makes the film a boxing movie. Baby on the other hand, while steeped in boxing and its milieu, doesn't care about winning or being a contender. What it cares about are the people who live with the sport and how this world affects them, their attitudes and their actions.Frankie Dunn is a boxing promoter. He's a tough old geezer and one of the best in his field. His one flaw is a serious drawback in his line of work. He doesn't like to see his fighters get hurt. Frankie's life is an endless cycle of developing young fighters only to be abandoned when he refuses to take them to the next level out of fear for their safety. One day Maggie Fitzgerald wanders into his gym. She's a youngish woman who wants to be a boxer. No, she wants to be a winner and she is more than willing to do whatever it takes to become one. Despite his years, his experience and his distaste for training a 'girly' Frankie is no match for Maggie's tenacity and soon finds himself with a determined protégé who begins her swift rise to the top. This is only part of the story however. Events occur that test these two in ways far crueler than the force of a heavyweight's punch.It has to be said that neither Hilary Swank nor Morgan Freeman are overly believable in their roles. Of the three leads only Eastwood looks likes he could spend his days in a dingy old gym. The spindly Swank is unconvincing as a power puncher and Freeman comes across like a slumming PhD. This is an instance, however, where suspension of disbelief pays off in the long run. A little loss of feasibility buys you two great performances. Maggie is a woman whose tough exterior hides a tougher interior wrapped around a will of iron. This is both her triumph and her tragedy. Swank captures these qualities in a natural, loose jointed performance that manages to make this rough customer appealing. Morgan Freeman is an actor who can steal a scene with just a look or turn of phrase. Here he's called upon to act as narrator and observer of human tragedy. He does so with dry objectivity leavened with a hint of bemused sorrow. As Frankie Eastwood is excellent as a man whose job and background conspire against his compassionate nature. The rasp of his voice sounds like a soul tearing itself apart.Million Dollar Baby is not an easy movie to like. It takes two people who are the sum of their experiences and needs and rubs them together under horrendously stressful situations. It is like a case study, showing a little human truth as the film makers see it. If you approach it on those terms you will find Baby a worthwhile investment. You will, however, find yourself admiring the accomplishment more than loving the experience.",9,0,1,3 April 2005
The Matrix Reloaded," Fantastic action rewards the patient.
","Say you're at a heavyweight bout. Not just any bout mind you, but the fabled `Thrilla in Manila'.  Ali and Frazier enter the ring. The crowd goes wild! Frazier warily eyes Ali. Ali taunts Frazier. The crowd holds its breath! The bell sounds and - Frazier and Ali spend the next half hour discussing French literary theory. Sure, eventually Frazier gets disgusted with Ali's neo-Freudian deconstructionist attitude and starts throwing punches but by that time the crowd's snoring. That, in a nutshell, is the experience of The Matrix Reloaded. This movie has stunts, fights and spectacular action to spare after you've sat through enough gaseous bloviating to float the Hindenburg.In The Matrix we learned that Sentient Machines have enslaved the human race. Physically humans live in a cocoon hooked up to enormous electrical collectors. Mentally, however, they live within `The Matrix', a vast virtual reality designed to emulate 21st century earth.  We followed the adventures of Neo as he finds he may be `The Chosen One' to lead the Human Race out of bondage. The Matrix Reloaded starts a short while after the events of the first movie. Machines have discovered the location of the free human city of Zion and are out to destroy it. Only Neo and his band of rebels offer any hope of salvation.The leads do a decent job staying ahead of the special effects. Keanu Reeves' strong suit, looking vaguely puzzled by the world about him, works well for Neo the befuddled virtual messiah. Carrie-Anne Moss again is memorable as Trinity.  Unfortunately, her character has devolved from the tough resistance leader of the first movie to being Neo's babe in this one. While Moss has her share of action scenes, Trinity's prime function now is to be saved by Neo. Laurence Fishburne's endlessly philosophical Morpheus handles the bulk of the movies speechifying. When not pontificating, Morpheus is given to looming stoically over Neo's shoulder.  Only Fishburne's charisma keeps this leaden character from bringing the movie to a screeching halt. Hugo Weaving's dryly-humorous take on the evil Agent Smith gives his scenes some needed verve and Gloria Foster as the all-knowing Oracle perks up a potentially slow patch. The rest of the cast tends to be swallowed by the blood and thunder and the sprawling dull patches.Once past the first half hour or so the action picks up dramatically. You are rewarded for your patience with fabulously impossible martial arts displays, spectacular action sequences and the mother of all chase scenes. These are the stuff of summer movie heaven. However, even as events start to hurtle along, Neo and his pals are wont to take lengthy breaks for their sit-down palavers.It can't be stressed enough how much the endless nattering hurts The Matrix Reloaded.  The speeches are so clumsily written that most of the actors have their tongues tripped up. Only Weaving and Foster manage to put an entertaining spin on them. The content - speculations on the nature of reality, free will, causality and the like - resemble the type of philosophical gibberish you'd hear around a half empty keg in the hospitality suite of a Star Trek convention. Don't get me wrong here. Most of The Matrix Reloaded is a heck of a lot of fun but you might want to wait for the DVD and the relief of a fast forward button.",Null,0,0,9 June 2003
Hitch," A Perfect Example of its Genre
","Hitch is a romantic comedy. Of all movie genres romantic comedies are the most formula bound. Just as we know Perry Mason will win the case and Jason will kill a bunch of teenagers, we know that the handsome man will get the beautiful girl after around ninety minutes of painfully contrived obstacles. Why? Because that is what the audience wants. We don't go to these movies looking for innovation. We want the boy to get the girl and woe betides the director who messes with us in the name of Art. The danger of formula is it encourages sloppy productions. Cast some pretty leads, lay the jokes in with a trowel and stack the corn at the end and your golden, right? The nation's cinemas are littered with the wreckage of this sort of thinking. What the smart producer knows is while audiences may want the familiar ride they are also looking for a good story well told. The makers of Hitch were very smart. The movie conforms in every way to formula but distinguishes itself from the pack by its writing, some genuinely funny gags and its amiable tone.Will Smith plays Hitch, a modern matchmaker dedicated to helping the average Joe land the girl of his dreams. His clients must be sincerely in love and he insists on working in secrecy, being more of a Cyrano de Bergerac than a Dolly Levi. His advice is sound and he genuinely cares for the schlubs that form his clientele. His current case involves a chubby, disaster prone accountant crazy for a beautiful heiress. As Hitch sets to work he meets an improbably sweet gossip columnist and finds himself falling in love. Of course Hitch is deathly afraid of commitment and the gossip is stubbornly cynical about romance in general. All of this folderol is as insubstantial as it sounds. Hitch does not incline the viewer to trot out weighty French critical terminology.Romantic comedies rise and fall on the charm of their leads. Those fluffy Rock Hudson/Doris Day comedies of the '60s would not be so fondly remembered if they starred, say, John Cassavetes and Gena Rowlands. Will Smith and Eva Mendes have charm to spare. Importantly Smith as Hitch doesn't come across as insincere. He's a nice articulate guy who genuinely likes the opposite sex and does his best by them. Mendes matches Smith's intelligence and gives Hitch reasons beyond her beauty for his growing infatuation. The supporting cast is no less involving. Kevin James is a hopeless, clumsy mess as the lovelorn accountant and his struggle to implement Hitch's smooth moves are as hilarious as they are endearing. Julie Ann Emery as Mendes' eternally hopeful best friend and Adam Arkin as Mendes' level headed boss are excellent. The only possible quibble is Amber Valletta as the heiress lacks the oomph in either looks or personality to so captivate the poor accountant.Hitch is a determinedly sunny movie. With the exception of one loathsome yuppie all the characters are decent and likable, even those who work for the NY Post style tabloid. Manhattan is a beautiful and happy place where everyone is at least moderately well to do and there is no racial or ethnic tension. It's a world where love carries the stacked deck and Cupid is all mighty. Yes, this is a fantasy as broad as anything you'd see Gollum in, but man does not live by angst alone. Sometimes charm and laughs are important and Hitch fills the bill brilliantly.",9,0,1,2 March 2005
Hart's War," A familiar Morality tale told with verve.
","Hart's War is an old-fashioned problem movie.  A problem movie would, under the guise of a popular genre, 'fearlessly confront' some timely social ill. These weren't necessarily bad films. Movies like The Defiant Ones, In The Heat of the Night and High Noon are great entertainment.  Often, though, the message would trump the medium and the films would practically scream 'Watch me Stupid, I'm good for you!' Unfortunately Hart's War does its fair share of screaming.Callow Lt. Hart is a desk-jockey hustler who finds himself in a German POW camp.  Col. McNamara, the senior POW, doesn't like the cut of Hart's jib and assigns him to the enlisted man's barracks as punishment. For less noble reasons two black fighter pilots are also assigned there. The reaction to the pilots is exactly what you might expect and soon the most vicious bigot is dead with one of the pilots standing over the body. Hart has some legal training and is ordered by McNamara to defend the pilot. Every thing seems clear-cut but, of course, there are wheels within wheels.Hart's War is definitely compelling.  The cinematography and attention to physical detail are magnificent.  The few action scenes are well staged. Indeed, considered as just a wartime mystery movie Hart's War is truly excellent. Where it falls short is with its problem movie aspirations. The film wants to instruct us in the realities of race relations. To really do so it would have to give us three-dimensional characters with all the light and shadows of the human condition.  The message movie rules by which Hart's War operates won't allow that, however.  Human concerns and frailties muddy the message and so, to make sure we 'Get The Point,' the movie is populated by stereotypes.The actors do what they can with what they have. Most give pretty interesting performances but some can be seen struggling to rise above the caricatures.  Lt. Hart is a charming sleaze and, in years past, the role would have gone to James Garner or Tony Curtis.  Hart's War is saddled with Colin Farrell. It's not that Farrell is conspicuously horrible; he just doesn't show much spark or personality and never, ever convinces us that he is a W.W.II era officer.  Bruce Willis, on the other hand, looks perfectly comfortable in both period and uniform. Willis has always been underrated as an actor.  His strength is that he is a rock steady performer who doesn't strain for effect. He adds substance to most everything that he's in. He certainly does so in Hart's War.Terrence Howard plays the accused pilot and does a pretty good job despite his role being less a character than a learning opportunity. European actor Marcel Iures is a standout as the prison camp commandant, a man worn out from ignoring the angels of his better nature. Cole Hauser plays the bigot. He initially does some interesting work but eventually the demands of stereotype overwhelmed his considerable talents.You can't get angry with Hart's War.  The film works very hard to be entertaining as it tries to shove its message home. It shows a real concern for old time movie craftsmanship. I can recommend the movie but, unless you slept through the Civil Rights era, don't expect to be enlightened by the message.",7,1,2,30 March 2002
300," Absolutely the best venal movie since Birth Of A Nation
","What can you say about 300, a movie that is one long and woozy love letter to the ancient, war loving Spartans? That pictures infanticide and extreme child abuse as an admirable form of social engineering? Where the light skinned and English accented heroes slaughter vast numbers of their dark and stupid foes? Where to be a woman is to proudly bear sons for the Fatherland and stand by your man as he swaggers off to suicidal carnage? Where to be old, sick, malformed or effeminate is to be evil? That proudly wears its fascistic heart on its national socialist sleeve? Well, what you could say is that it is one fantastically entertaining movie! 300 tells the story of the three hundred Spartans who held off the entire Persian army at Thermopylae. Sparta runs afoul of the Persians by refusing to submit to their rule. Treachery rears its ugly head and good King Leonidas is forbidden to use the Spartan legions to lay waste to the enemy. He sets out with three hundred doughy volunteers to hold the eastern horde off long enough for the Spartan senate to come to their senses. The eventual fate of Leonidas and his comrades is one of the most famous stories of ancient times and 300 more than does it justice.There are no real stars in 300 though Gerard Butler has a star-making role as Leonidas. He handles spear, beefcake poses and faux-Shakespearian dialog with equal aplomb. Lena Headey is very good as Queen Gorgo but can't rise above the fact that she is a chick hanging out in a boy's club. Her role is primarily to look decorative and stoic in equal measures. Beyond these two and perhaps Dominic West as a dodgy member of the Spartan senate or Rodrigo Santoro as the ten foot tall and supremely swishy Xerxes, there isn't a member of the cast well known or forceful enough to stand out from the rest. Everyone involved delivers fine performances but the fact is their roles are subservient to the design, emotionality and heedless energy of the piece.300 is another movie made on a virtual set. That is, with the exception of the actors, most of what you see isn't real, it's computer animated. While perhaps not as amazing as the similarly filmed Sin City or Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, 300's surreal copper and sepia-toned fever dream of ancient Greece is an achievement in its own right.300 is being damned and praised by all sides of the political spectrum. The fact is 300 could be used as a motivational tool for just about any group in need of a testosterone fix. It's guaranteed to get your guys on their feet and ready to rumple. Make no mistake though, there have been few truly excellent movies made with such dodgy sentiments since Birth of a Nation. Judged solely on the merits of it's politics 300 brings certain words to mind, 'venal' and 'pestilent' being the most polite. Judged as adventurous entertainment however, 300 has few equals.It would be easy to dissect 300 and lambaste its lack of historical veracity. After all the historical Spartans were sort of a bronze age Hell's Angels and were roundly hated by their long suffering neighbors. As to their vaunted militarism, even the effete Athenians were able to kick the tar out of them from time to time. This is all beside the point. 300 was not made for rational discussion. This is a movie made to bypass the frontal lobe and stir the Cro-Magnon id. It is supposed to get its audience frothing at the mouth. This 300 does with such dexterity and malevolent ingenuity as to render it an instant classic of its kind.",8,11,24,14 March 2007
Gangs of New York," Terrific Entertainment!
","Gangs of New York is just perfect entertainment. It is an enthralling, bloody, melodramatic epic that more than justifies its two and one half hour running time. In Gangs director Martin Scorsese spins another tale of the New York underworld but with a twist. Instead of the mid-twentieth century organized crime milieu of Goodfellas, Scorsese ventures back to the 19th century to show us the origin of the modern street gang. It's the early 1860s and the notorious Five Points slum is ruled by the savage `Bill the Butcher'. The viciously nationalistic Bill terrorizes all the immigrant masses jammed into his slum but seems to harbor a particular hatred for the Irish population. Into this seething cauldron wanders mysterious young Amsterdam Vallon who soon works his way into the trust and affection of Bloody Bill. Amsterdam, however, has a past with the unsuspecting Butcher and sports an agenda not unlike a certain Prince of Denmark. Bloody vengeance and dark betrayal soon come to pass, all played against a backdrop of corruption and unrest that lead to up to the horrors of New York Civil War draft riots. Daniel Day-Lewis is marvelous as Bill the Butcher. His Bill is both recognizably human and a full bore, moustache-twirling villain. Day-Lewis strides his savage and profane way across the screen and steals the whole of the movie. The only other actor to approach Day-Lewis' level is Jim Broadbent as William 'Boss' Tweed. Broadbent is Tweed's spitting image and he makes the grasping old pirate so winning we find ourselves rooting for Tweed against the gaggle of reformers that infest his domain.  Though Leonardo DiCaprio is the nominal lead of the picture he is overshadowed by his co-stars.  Large, slope shouldered and vaguely brutish looking, DiCaprio is physically perfect for Amsterdam.  While he could have used some of the fire and rage of a young James Cagney, DiCaprio's acting is superior throughout the movie. The problem is that Amsterdam just isn't as flashy a role as Bill or Tweed and, as good as DiCaprio is; Day-Lewis operates on a whole other level. Cameron Diaz as the beautiful pickpocket Jenny,  never convinces that she is a product of the slums. Despite having considerable screen time, Diaz fades into the background when compared to her more powerful co-stars. Just as important as the actors are to Gangs is the period atmosphere that drips off the screen. The amazing old New York set has an air of lived in reality that you could cut with a knife. You can almost smell the vermin. Gangs is entirely free of the embalmed feeling you get from most modern period movies.  The cast handles the period argot as if it were their true speech and wear their costumes like lived-in clothing. You come away convinced that this is how the world looked and sounded in 1862. Scorsese does eschew all nuance and subtlety in Gangs. Instead he tells his tale in wide, bold, exploitive and melodramatic strokes that make the movies two and a half hours fly by. Be warned that if you are waiting to see Gangs on DVD you are making a huge mistake. Gangs has to be seen at the theater. The detail and scope of the film cries out to be viewed in all its wide screen glory.  This movie is a fantastic achievement.",Null,197,261,30 January 2003
