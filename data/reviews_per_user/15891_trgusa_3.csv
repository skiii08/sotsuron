The Benchwarmers," Baseball, Payback, and Gross Vulgarity Still Mix
","If you enjoy vomiting, crap throwing and smearing, burping, farting, farting on people's faces, booger picking, and booger eating... then this is just the movie for you! This movie is a 6th-grader's feast! I say movie, not film, because it would never rank (pun) being called a film, much less draw dignity from any critics or reviewers.Aside from that, it has an interesting plot twist and a few moments here and there. Once you get past all the bodily functions you might even have a bit of fun seeing this once... but don't watch and eat your dinner at the same time!In the end, this was a quick buck aimed at the grade-schoolers using 2nd rate, unemployed, or desperate actors... more power to them I suppose. At least they didn't pretend to have made a serious work.Put this in your 'Pre-Teen' category, or, not quite a 'Teen' movie...",3,2,3,23 April 2006
Alexander," Artistic Hogwash
","Bottom line of this movie is Don't Bother... it is neither 'historically' accurate, nor 'culturally' accurate... in the Anthropological end, Alexander had NO purpose, no world vision, and NO scorching 'cause' to battle for...This is not to mention the massive confusion you will experience as to separating Persia, Babylon, Assyria, Macedonia, and Greece in a stew of inaccurate time periods for the sake of 'continuity'?Alexander's TRUE story would have been far GREATER, and shorter.Other than some of the lavish sets, the rest is pure Hollywood amusement with stifled acting and poor character development... served to you at YOUR expense.",1,4,6,25 February 2006
War of the Worlds," War of the Worlds Revisted
","This is the first movie in years that glued me to my chair... the suspense and graphics were simply fantastic... I found Tom Cruise's role to be somewhat lacking as usual, but who cares about plot or characters? For that matter, Dakota Fanning stole the show, and if you want plot, read the 1898 book.I thought the beginning and the end were very prophetic, and tied together well. Throughout the movie you have a sense of fear and hopelessness, a perfect combination! You should see this movie to remind yourself what is plausible... and for the sheer fun and thrill of it!",7,0,1,17 April 2006
