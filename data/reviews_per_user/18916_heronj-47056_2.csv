Hereditary," Looked forward to this
","When it started, I was hooked, literally hanging on every word Toni Collette said, completely immersed myself in the film.
There were some goose bumps and chills down your spine moments, ghostly apparition of her mother in the basement, decapitation and that bone chilling scream. I was in for a neurological roller coaster of emotion and fear...
Then, 15 minutes from the end... it was almost like watching a different film, the jumps and oh my gods from earlier on from the audience had now changed to... laughing...
I won't ruin the end, but I did spend the next 2 hours trying to make some sense as to what just happened. Naked blue people? A odd fitting crown...? The film is 2 hours 7 minutes. If it was 1 hour 40, it would have been perfect!",4,3,6,10 September 2018
Joker," Difficult and Brilliant
","This was not entertainment. I sat on the recliner chair and I must say that within 10 minutes my back was upright and my eyes fixed on the screen. Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of the Joker was difficult to watch but at the same time enthralling beautiful.
The film gradually built the character up as an Origin movie should. I just hope, that this Joker becomes part of the DC Universe, as to see what he becomes after this would grant 'closure' in some ways.",9,1,2,14 October 2019
