Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Disappointment is an understatement.
","This is the film that Lucas proclaims as his original vision for the original Star Wars.  What a load of rubbish.  The original Star Wars, (or now called Episode IV: Star Wars: A New Hope) is much better.I actually watched this film in 1999 in the cinema, and I thought it was barely passable back then.  I found it irritating, annoying and no real flow.But I didn't really want to write a review of the film until I had saw the original trilogy - I was one of those rare people who hadn't seen the trilogy and wanted to make a fair, balanced judgement of this film.  After seeing the trilogy on video, I can honestly say that this is a complete mess, a complete disappointment and an excuse for Lucas to turn his 'vision' into a money-making scheme, where the 'force' - once something mystical, 'something all around us' and spirtual is now turned into a marketing tagline explained away by chemicals known only as midichlorians.The premise of this is the fact that two Jedi ambassadors are sent to achieve peace from the invading, and so obvious Japanese styled alien invaders.  But of course, they realise its a trap and soon try to rescue the princess or whatever and soon take out the alien invaders which leave Senator Palpatine in control, thus making the situation much worse than it originally was.So, okay the idea and plot isn't bad - every legend needs a first step, and indeed this is it.  I am not complaining about that, what I am complaining about is the sheer horridness of this film.For example, Jar Jar is just a pain in the CGI ass.  What was his role in the film?  Did he have a purpose other than to sell toys?  Of course not, Lucas sold out to toy makers.  The same could be argued about the pod racing - it has no real purpose in the film.The CGI is very well handled, well except for close-ups of Jar Jar and Obi-Wan Kenobi (MacGregor) and the action sequences seem fine until the end where Lucas strives to impose a sense of an 'adrenaline rush' to viewers, but ends up ruining the exceptionally cherographed lightsaber fight sequence.Anakin is also a problem, typecast as a nine year old kid who says 'Golly' and 'Uh Oh' and stuff.  Darth Vader doesn't say stuff like that.  The horridness of Anakin's character is eptiomized when he 'accidently' blows up a younger version of the death star in a fighter jet.  Oh boy, this is just plain bad.Well, Lucas says that this film isn't made for the trilogy fans and says that this is a kids film.  What hogwash, if it were, why would the original trilogy have a darkness style to them?Overall this is a disappointment, not only to a sci-fi fan, but to star wars fans.  Personally I enjoyed Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon - which is what this film (indeed the whole trilogy, or the whole sextant) should feel and be like.My overall view is that this film can only be summarized as being disappointing...but even that is an understatement.Overall: 3/10.",Null,1,2,7 February 2001
Minority Report," Logan's Run meets Twelve Monkeys?
","Based on a short story by the same guy who wrote Blade Runner, Minority Report tells the story of a future where Crime is prevented by the pre-crime division who use pre-cogs, essentially gentically altered mystic megs, to prevent a crime before it happens.Prevention of a crime must be a dream come true to any politican, and indeed most of the technological advancements and eye-candy that we get to see in the film is a dream come true, but I felt it was a tad too long, that I didn't care about Tom Cruise's character - and that was a shame, because for a while I liked the film.Whilst parts of the film suggest inspiration from Kubrick's films such as Clockwork Orange, etc there are parts where I thought 'this is just a Logan's Run redux', I even sat, expecting someone to shout 'RUNNER!'Anyway the film is very good, very dark and very atmospheric, but I don't think it forefilled its full potential - espcally with the mountain of plot holes and 'feel-good' ending which wasn't needed.I thought this film was very good, but not overally brilliant.",Null,0,0,5 July 2002
Rocky V," The worst in the series
","This is the worst of the Rocky films, though its not hard to point out the reasons why.  Firstly the direction is slow, tiresome and not crisp enough. Secondly the plot - the explanation of Rocky's fortune disappearing?  This is ludicrously explained.  Not only that, its the only way Stallone can get his character back into what he once used to be - a humble character.You can see why Stallone wanted to change his character so much, he grew more and more visably tired with the role - his emotions and screen presence became more and more uneven or 'the just-don't-care' attitude.  Perhaps he thought returning to the roots was the only way to go?For some fans they want Rocky to fight super-duper-humans, or uber-eccentric guys, but it doesn't work, not any more - it would turn Rocky into a caricucture.  That's why we have the brian damage story, it shows Rocky is not Mr Invincible.Anyway the rest of the film is pretty boring and unevenly balanced.  We get introduced to Tommy Gunn, who Rocky trains and suddenly becomes his adoptive son (doesn't Gunn have his own family?), Rocky's own son becomes more and more depressed and resorts into wearing ear-rings (I'm sure he was wearing make-up in one scene!) and fighting in school - ho hum, heard it before - when are we going to see something new?Anyway Gunn always seems to played in a constant state of anger, perhaps because he was branded a puppet or robot - but that doesn't explain why he has to be so darn angry all the time - cool down damn it, your making this film unworkable.Anyway the end fight sequence is pretty poor.  The Don King-a-like is pretty hamy and is constantly annoying.  The only good thing is the end credits.2/10.",Null,1,4,17 November 2000
X-Men," Action movie for the not-so Brain Dead
","Hollywood often goes for the easy option - make an action movie with tons of brilliant action sequences or sfx and forget about the plot or background story.  X-Men doesn't do this, instead it is a very intelligent, and well founded story packed with enough action to make you sit up and take notice.The film's premise is acceptance and tolerance - and our attitudes to other things other than the 'norm'.  However it doesn't seem to question 'what is the norm, and whom defines the norm'.A brutal example of this is where the film starts out in Poland 1944 - where we see Magneto as a child being ripped apart from his loving family and his family sent to the death camps, this was pretty dark and gritty - yet it didn't have that real kick to it that it needed.It has Magento played by the maginficent Sir Ian McKellen - sigining McKellen as Magento was a master stroke - but alas his on-screen scenes with Stewart (as Professor Xavier) were far and few between, I wanted more of them.The film, although a tad silly does have brilliant SFX, sometimes you hardly notice it - your not meant to, your meant to sit back and enjoy this film - and I did.It was a shame that Ray Park's fighting skills were not on screen as they were in Phantom Menance - and its a shame we weren't told why Sabretooth hated Wolverine or why Magento didn't realise his brain was scanned when sexy Famke Jannsen was using that mind enhasing machine...Apart from this the film is a good intelligent film - its a shame they were little holes in the plot or script, and its a shame that the end scene's on the Statue of Liberty were never the climax it was meant to be - its a good film, but its an action film, no more - no less.",Null,0,0,21 August 2000
The Bourne Identity," Cliched but still entertaining
","I never read the book but I thought this film was very fun, entertaining and very good throughout. The action was crisp and it moved very well from one locale to the next.The plot may be a reject from every other b-movie actioner around but its still good. And whilst Bourne isn't a secret agent (of sorts), he is an assassin out to kill some African Delegate threatening to expose CIA missions in the Congo or something.I think Matt Damon plays Bourne very well. His Aikido/Jujitsu is very fresh, fast and he gives the impression he's doing it on instict rather than showing he knows the moves.Yes it did drag a bit, and yes every cliche out of hollywood comes out of this (for example: he's an assassin who cares - pl-eeze).  But I think it's pretty good for a cheap seat at a cheap cinema. I wouldn't go top dollar for this movie I don't think its worth it.Julia Stiles is also in this, but doesn't really do anything of interest. The most intreging character was Clive Owen's 'Professor'. Saying almost nothing but showing off his brooding James Bond/Tim Dalton with Glasses look.Its entertaining until the very end where Damon decides to go all out as Chow Yun Fat wannabe...but whereas Fat would slide down the bannister, Damon jumps off the side and flies down to the bottom. That one sequence is just plain stupid and funny at the same time when its not meant to be.Overall: 6/10",Null,1,2,6 September 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," Not sure what to make of this 'revolution'
","I'm not sure what to make of Matrix Revolutions. Sure I agree with the people that it isn't as intelligent, thoughtful or as laid out as the original, sure it lacks the venom or fear in the fight sequences - and somehow the CGI doesn't seem to add to the film anymore.So what's it missing?  I personally think its lacking a real threat, we already know Neo is the one and can bend the rules of the matrix world - so we don't fear his downfall because we know he'll eventually rise up.Take for example when Neo, in the first Matrix film, walks onto a ledge on a high-rise building - the shot of him looking down and you see the drop was intelligent - but the other films seemed to be more lazy in their manner - going for the quick buck rather the hard sell.Everyone agrees that the first Matrix film was very good - I didn't at the time - I called a mess, but it has grown on me - it has taken an old philosophical puzzle and turned it on its head.  The second film went deeper into the puzzle but ruined itself with constant long scenes that didn't seem to go anywhere and it made mistakes by allowing everyone in the 'real world' to do all the special skills that Neo had - which diminished the threat of the Agents.This film throws away almost all references to the second film and slaps back straight into the action. There's plenty of action revolving the invasion of Zion and most of it is enjoyable, but there are questions revolving the use of EMP and their lack of basic military tactics.Aside from the attack on Zion, the movie revolves around the constant themes of religion - one actor speaks of the role of karma as being he's soul's duty to perform - however this is a mistake - what he was really referring to was Dharama.Anyway - this theme is rallied home when Neo decides to take on Smith in the final reels of the film and sacrifices himself to save all humans and give peace in the ongoing war against man and machine.I didn't like the fight between Neo and Smith - I was expecting an extremly hard, fast almost hyperkenetic fight that would rival the very best kung fu movies from Hong Kong - instead we get a fly-by-wire fight that rivals Superman II.Finally I was puzzled by Neo's final realisation of the 'truth' - he must cause mass genocide (ie: kill everyone in the matrix) to save everybody in the real world.  Was this really 'adventures of anti virus', or something more?I feel that this movie involved me in the fight in Zion, but not in the fight against Smith - it didn't involve or excite me with its characters (Neo was just plain boring and Trinity didn't really do anything). Which is a shame, considering the 'pedigree' of its original.Overall: 5/10.",Null,0,0,14 November 2003
Ocean's Eleven," Enjoyable Caper Movie
","Although this movie is not without is cliche's and it isn't original, it does play it to its strength.  Whilst Sodenburgh may be famous for more camera wizzardery in Traffik and The Limely, this film seems slow paced and more boring than the rest.  But that's not to say the actors seem to enjoy themselves.The movie is enjoyable, the premise is flawed, and are most of the sequences - espcailly that awful cockney accent.  The styling reminds me of a cross between Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and the hit tv-series Mission: Impossible.There's a multitude of caper movies with 'impossible' break-ins, this doesn't do anything different, except perhaps include a heavy a-list of actors.Its enjoyable, a little memorable, but nothing new.Overall: 6/10",Null,0,1,16 February 2002
Die Hard 2," Not as good as the 1st
","The first die hard was witty, amazing to watch - no, fantastic to watch. Willis, unlike other action heroes of the time, gives bang-for-buck but he adds something which the others don't have...charm.This is almost a carbon copy of the first one, but it has more over-the-top action than the first.  It does have lots of sub-plots which make it slightly different to the first.  But the tension and atmosphere of the first is gone.The villian, a karate commando type character, is not as villianous as Gruber.  The plot, revolving around drug smuggling, and the release of a general is okay - but not water tight.  The fact that there were near-by airports to take the planes also makes this pretty unbelievable.Don't get me wrong.  There is a lot of bang-for-your-buck.  And typical of the die-hard-on-the/in-the/with-the stories that were being pumped out of Hollywood at this time, it doesn't disappoint.  But its a shame that it doesn't have the same thrill ride or inspiration that the first one had.Good, but not brilliant.  6/10",Null,0,2,2 December 2000
The Transporter," Above-Average action movie that lacked real danger
","When I first heard action superemo Corey Yeun was going to work with British actor Jason Statham to make a film called 'The Transporter', my mind started to think 'oh no - yeun has decided to ruin his career'.However as soon as I saw this movie, I was actually quite surprised to see Mr Statham pulling off some very impressive martial art moves however I think it was ruined by constant quick-cutting and MTV-style editing, which reminded me of the overly-cut fight sequences in Rush Hour.The film, which I'm sure will spawn a b-movie version called 'The Courier' and will probably star Steven Seagal or Dolph Lundgren, has Mr Statham a very good Courier with a pretty name, ie: the Transporter.He delivers goods and has very strict rules.  But one day he decides to break his own rules when he discovers he smuggling a pretty Chinese girl around France.The film has lots of good, excellent action sequences - which include impressive fight sequences - but you should never judge a movie based upon its first 10, 20 minutes of action.  This movie slows down, a heck of a lot - to explain its plot.The pretty Chinese girl's dad (whom I'm sure was wearing a lot of make-up) is in cahoots with an evil criminal with a goatee (you knew he was evil because his passport picture) to smuggle lots of Chinese immigrants across France.  Why?  Err, I'm not sure.The film suffers from horrible dialogue, fast-cutting and sequences where I felt Jason Statham's character was never in any danger.Overall this is an average action movie that could, should have been a lot better.Rating: 4.5/10",Null,0,1,2 June 2004
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Poetically Beautiful, makes you want to fall in love with film all over
","I will be the first to admit that the year 2000 has not been the best year for film.  Films such as Charlie's Angels and such have been successful not because they are good, but because of their marketing.  Again and again we get the 'event' movie and again and again we walk out even more disappointed.This film, however is different.  This is clearly, by far, the best film of 2000, or if you like in the UK like me - this is the first best film of the 21st century (the 21st century started in 2001, not 2000!).#Ang Lee's beautifully poetic, poigiant and brilliant film is wonderous to watch, marvel in and enjoy.  The flying scene's might not be understood and indeed I heard a few 'groans' in the back rows - after a while they disappeared, they realised that the flying scene's reflect the inner beauty of this film.The story is not as cliched as it sounds, it revolves around the brilliant Chow Yun Fat and the mesmerizing Michelle Yeoh (who looks as stunning as ever) who try to keep their feelings away from each other.  Their interactions are wonderously portrayed, especially from Yeoh - who's eyes seem to reflect the deep bottled up love to Chow.The fight sequences are beautifully shot and cherographed.  But the film isn't about fight sequences, just as it isn't about the comb.  They are symbolic of the film.The scenery, the backdrops and the whole feel of the film is one to fall in love with.  Indeed I was captured by its warmth and its charm.Even the young princess who believes in escaping to freedom and uses the jade sword to accomplish her quest is wonderous to watch, she seems to lift every scene she is in.What Ang Lee has done is to reinvegerate a flagging genre by combining and intertwining Western ideals into Eastern ideals and in doing so reinvegerate the kung fu genre - for too long it has been a joke - and for too long its been the product of action films and not romantic films such as this - for too long the kung fu films have been all about action and not about plot or characterization - this film is all that and more.But it isn't just a kung fu film - its a romantic film, its poetic and it has a message of being true to yourself and others - even if that means losing a chance at true freedom (salvation).In some respects, this film is what the Phantom Menance, indeed what the whole Star Wars films should have been like.With this film, is there any real need for the over the top, low budget kung fu action we have had for the past twenty so years?  I don't think so - Ang Lee has forefilled the wishes of all those who read chinese books and poems - and all those who wanted a romantic, poetically brilliant film.A truly beautiful and sublime film.  Its certainly the best film I've ever seen - and one worth enjoying again and again.My Rating: 10/10",Null,0,0,10 January 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Beautifully poetic, makes you want to fall in love with film again
","I have to say that the year 2000 has been very disappointing for film, films such as Charlie's Angels, Snatch, Gone in Sixty Seconds, etc have all showed Hollywood's hollowness when it comes to film.  The only good film was Gladiator, that was very well done - however Ang Lee's beautifully shot Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon takes its mantle as the best film of 2000, or if your in the UK (like me) the best film of 2001.This magnificent and poetic film is wonderous to watch and to marvel in. It's tough not to get a kick out of this operatic movie. There's fateful romance, legendary themes of honor and determination, strong heroines, and fantastically choreographed martial arts which finally put films such as Jackie Chan's Drunken Master 2 or the Matrix to shame.The fight moves, masterfully choreographed by The Matrix's Woo-Ping Yu have a definitive poetic flow to them which suits the films mood and melodramatic beautifully.  The fly-by-wire scene's may get a few groans from Western Audience's - but there is a beauty in those sequences that weren't captured by the Matrix or other previous films.The two main characters played brilliantly by Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh (who looks as stunning as ever!) carry off their roles with charm, and the melancholy of their unspoken love has real pathos.There's also plenty of backstory to fill the melodrama, amongst the intertwining plotline - there is Jade Fox's disciple, the beautiful Jen (Zhang Zi Yi), an aristocrat with a delicate exterior but the heart of a fighter. She's preparing to marry into wealth, but has a dream of escaping with Pirate Lo - and a dream where she can do as she pleases and is not constrained by her family or wealth.One of the film's centerpieces is a perfect reflection of its sheer beauty - Chow Yun Fat and Jen swordfight among the wispy treetops, soaring and climbing to the quiet strains of cellist Yo-Yo Ma.It has many messages, such as that life constantly devoted to the study of Martial Arts is not a beautiful one, but one filled with sorrow.  Or messages such as finding your own path may lead you to destiny.  Also towards the end the haunting message that Chow gives to Yeoh about being a ghost by her side rather than rise to the next level in life is mesmerizingly beautiful and sad.Ang Lee's achievement is to reconnect the flagging martial arts genre with its latent sense of decorum and romance, qualities which have been ignored by other martial arts films who seemed to confuse martial arts with action.Crouching Tiger exposes the fatal secrets of martial arts with those of meditation and even calligraphy, and persuades us to take them equally seriously.  Added to the maticilous skill in rendering the delicate touches of the principals' hidden love, he has an epic sense of space and landscape, moving lightly from Peking to the desert: Ang Lee puts a girdle around his earth in seconds.This film is what the Phantom Menance should have felt like.  And Ang Lee must certainly win the best picture award at this year's Oscars, but knowing Hollywood, they'll give Ang Lee the best foreign picture - which is a shame, because this film is certainly the best I've ever seen in a long time.Overall: Sublime, Superb, Brilliant.

Mission: Impossible II," I was disappointed
","Mission: Impossible 2 was disappointing and could never exceed or even meet its overhyped advertising or its hard rock and roll image.  I am a John Woo fan, and I've seen many, but not all of his films and I have to say that I don't think Woo's heart was in this film.Unlike the first Mission:Impossible film this has an easy to understand plot mixed with a hybrid of a 1980's like action film and a weak script. This is nothing like the first Mission: Impossible or even the brilliant tv show. Hunt is not the human spy but an all-out one-man hero who can do everything himself.Where's the teamwork, the credible plot twisting or the intelligent use of gadgets?  I was expecting John Woo to have gone back to the TV show and brought out what made it good and gave us something special - for example I wanted to see John Woo make one IMF team play against another IMF team (a sort of cat and mouse game on a big scale).The plot of M:I-2 has Dougray Scott's character (an ex-IMF guy turned bad) stealing a super-flu virus and is hoping to sell it to some chemical company and make tons of money on the stock market whilst Hunt (Cruise) must recover it with the help (or lack of it) from Newton, Luther and Richard Roxburgh.The romantic connection between Newton and Cruise was fine, the spanish dance scene was eye candy and showed what direction was.  Newton and Cruise did really well to hide the script and bring out a 'love' story. Unfortuently this is destroyed when Newton (who is a master thief) turns into a damsel in distress.  Her master thief skills were never really used.I agree with most of the reviewers who say that the film seems to be from a rejected James Bond script.  In fact most of the film seems to come from old James Bond or John Woo films.  For example, you have the two characters who are exactly alike and hate each other (taken from Face/Off and GoldenEye).The direction of this film was great, but not Woo's best.  I was expecting (espically after the Matrix) Woo to have really overused the bullet time, swing round shots, but he only used it a few times.  Some of the direction was masterful, others tired.Sometimes I felt Woo put things into the shot because people were expecting to see them (for example the doves or the two guns in slow-motion, etc) and Woo was never given the chance to tweak or invent new twists on his direction style.Some of the scenes were silly such as the huge number of cgi-enhanced rubber masks - where did they get them all from?  The motorbike scene was well executed, if not silly and over the top, ends in a face/off that is reminist of Bruce Lee's 'The Big Boss'.Anyway this film is fine to watch, the action is fine (but nothing beyond the ordinary), the script is weak and deserved someone proofreading it, the direction is good but not masterful.All in all it was enjoyable film, but I kinda felt like this film never really pushed the boundaries or action-direction any further.If they want to make M:I-3 then they need to work on a good complex script with twists, turns and a good workable plot - bring us back to what made the TV show so successful and not to what Hollywood expects is successful.",Null,0,0,10 July 2000
Mission: Impossible," Nowhere as good as the TV show
","I was expecting a lot from Mission: Impossible, too bad I was dissappointed.I was one of those kids who loved the 1960's Mission:Impossible TV Show, it had suspense, incredible storylines/plots, and it also used ingenious use of camera work.  So why was I so dissappointed by the movie?Well for one thing, the plot is far too damn complicated but its basically a molehunt/spy story.  This film does not concetrate on the plot, it doesn't need to - this film is about one person and one person alone...Tom Cruise and his acting capability.The bad guy in this overly complex plot is Jim Phelps.  This is an insult to every person who enjoyed the original TV show, and this is probably why Peter Graves (the guy who played phelps in the TV show) refused to do the movie.  How can this film justify the fact that Phelps is a two-timing bad guy?  By saying he'll get $10 million in bearer bonds.Anyway, the film whilst hurts on some levels, is enjoyable on others.  The film has memorable scenes such as the 'inside job' on the headquarters of the CIA where Cruise must recover the NOC list from a high-security room (note without CCTV!) and the fight on board a speeding bullet train.The film gets rid of its stars far too quickly, and never uses them to the best of their acting abilities, instead the focus is all on Cruise's character.Sure the film is enjoyable, but lacks the 'sting' from TV show, nor the credible acting or storyline that this kind of film deserves.",Null,0,2,18 January 2000
Reservoir Dogs," Not as good as City on Fire
","I had the rare chance to see Reservoir Dogs and its inspiration Ringo Lam's City on Fire in the same day, and I must say that the City on Fire version is far better than this film.I cannot pin the reasons why Dogs isn't as good as Fire, they are both very well made, highly directed films.  Perhaps because Fire has something more to offer than the 'who shall we blame' story of Dogs.I'm not saying that Dogs is a bad film, its very, very good.  Its a 90s classic.  Taratino shows that he is a good director but his inspirations (Woo, Lam) cloud this film and his direction.Even so, this is a good film, but you'd probably enjoy City on Fire more. 7/10",Null,1,3,28 November 2000
Rocky III," Fun, but nothing more
","The realism in the Rocky movies was never the subject, the idea was to show will, determination, insatiable desire for fame and glory, hope, etc. That's what Rocky was supposed to be.  But as the franchise wore on Stallone seems to get tired with the role, he is visibily tired when Rocky IV comes around, and in Rocky V he tries to make amends but fails dismaly.This film is fun, but the viewer should not to expect any more than that. The film is pretty good to watch, the fight sequences are okay but pretty unrealistic compared to Raging Bull (but as I've said above, realisim was never the key).There are good parts to the film, one being the under-written Mr T playing the venomus and tough opponent Clubber Lang. Its obvious Mr T had fun playing the role he always meant to play - every word he says spits the embodiment of hate and frustration - he is exactly like Rocky except his pride and underexpectation of his foes are his faliure.Otherwise this film is relatively good and an enjoyable watch. 5/10.",Null,1,4,17 November 2000
Wedding Crashers," Enjoyable, but totally flawed in every area.
","John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) have spent most of their working life crashing weddings in order to land girls and get laid, but in the middle of a wedding Beckwith falls in love with a Presidential Candidate's daughter (Claire Cleary played by Rachel McAdams) and the movie basically follows Beckwith love affair with Cleary.In what can only be described as a 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' meets 'Old School', this is a frat pack movie has plenty of laughs; but it also has a big void.I felt in watching this movie that I was watching Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn team up, their characters weren't important cause you know it's just Wilson and Vaughn goofing off, trying to out improvise jokes trying to cover up for the fact that there weren't many jokes to begin with.What also annoyed me about this movie was that Wilson and Vaughn are just too old to be playing Porky wannabe's. This 'Frat pack' also contains a brief cameo from Will Ferrell and his inclusion is meant to be a wake up call to Wilson's character; but ends up reinforcing the concept that his character was just an afterthought.Yes, the movie does have its laughs and outlandish charm. Rachel McAdams has a great smile and the romance between Owen's character and Rachel McAdams is well done.In the end, McAdams finds out the truth about Owen and Vaughn and forces them to fess up; leaving Owen desperate to tell her how much he loves her and even storms Vaughn's wedding to do this.The movie could have ended there; but the ending totally ruined the movie -- When Vaughn touts a major wedding they can gatecrash, McAdams's character basically says 'let's crash the wedding. Despite the fact I spent the last 30 minutes of the movie hating you for doing that exact thing, and was the main reason for breaking up with you.' That whole scene should have been cut out and let them drive off into the sunset.Overall I found this movie to be enjoyable, but totally flawed in almost every department.",Null,0,0,4 December 2006
Die Hard with a Vengeance," The day that action films died
","Most viewers remember the high-octane action films that were being pumped out of hollywood.  Most copied Die-Hard's uniqueness and made copies of the story.  They would effectively be referred to as 'Try Hard's' (because they tried hard to copy die hard) or 'Die-Hard-On-A'  (ie. Speed is Die-Hard-on-a-Bus, Under Siege is Die-Hard-On-A-Battleship).This was, in my view, the last 'Try Hard' film.  This film did not do too well in the states, this was because of a number of things:1) The okhaloma bombing of 1994/1995, and 2) Willis' boredom of action films.In fact the director of this film tries very, very hard to put some weight in the story just to please Willis' boredom of the McClane character - this meant giving Willis a sidekick in the shape of Samuel L.Jackson - who plays a badass black guy (as always!) - and they must stop a bored Jeremy Irons with a bad German Accent (if his brother can speak english - why can't he?) - who is trying to do one over the gold deposit in New York (err - isn't this GoldFinger - actually this is referenced when Irons says: 'Fort Knox is for tourists!').The film isn't actually all that bad.  It explodes brilliantly with a bombing on a busy NY street - and it makes you sit up and pay attention, but it slowly goes down hill.  The interracial jokes and bad cop, good cop idea that Jackson and Willis play is funny at some times, but mostly it is predictable.Irons doesn't play the character evenly enough.  Whereas Gruber almost carries the film in the first, Irons doesn't make a dent...sure Irons has muscles and he screws some random blonde girl - and he can fly a helicopter, but he just isn't sinister or evil enough.The film, to its credit, has pace, has a fluid pace to it.  Its a shame I was disappointed with the film and especially at the end - Willis was supposed to be on the floor - with a chopper hovering over him, he had lost the game - but the way it was directed - it made it felt that Willis STILL had the upper hand - even in the closing minutes when he whispers 'Say hi to your brother for me'.The character of McClane is gone.  You can see Willis is bored, but is given something to do in the solving of silly puzzles which don't add much to the film, and through the 'humorous' conversations with Jackson.Its no wonder why Willis doesn't want to do more Action films, but having seen this film I can see why.Lesson Learnt: Hire Die Hard again.

","The Matrix is fundamentally about a messiah called 'the one' (Keanu Reeves) who is a hacker who discovers that everyone hooked up to a computer simulation (altough why I have no idea) and is brought to the real world by Morpheous (played by a very bored Laurence Fishburne) and his crack team of hackers/terrorists.The plot has been overworked to an outer limits style, and it takes ages for the action and the film to actually kick in.The film in itself is boring and slow, the actors don't seem committed to their characters, they all seem bored, and inconsequential to the film, what mattered was the plot, the hong kong styled filming and the visually stunning special effects.The special effects appear to be very good, however the overuse of computer graphics on action setpieces (such as the helicopter sequence) leaves you feeling that you've been ripped off.  I want to see real stunts, explosions - not computer cgi-crap - sure it looks good, but if you want to make an action sequence at least make it believable.The way the film has been shot is likened to John Woo, with slowed down shooting sequences - graphically showing how the bullets fly off. Although this is beautifully shot, it does leave you wondering if you actually WANT to see a couple of people walking around in trenchcoats blowing people away (hang on, haven't I heard this somewhere before???).Apart from the overuse of CGI, I liked the combination this film used of martial arts and Hong Kong styled directoring, but the martial arts did feel as good as it should have been.  It leads me to ask if they wanted a good martial artist, why did they use the very stiff actor Keanu Reeves?  Why not Chow Yun Fat or even Jet Li - at least they look good when they do martial arts, Reeves just looks out of place doing all the complex martial arts.I hated the bad guys, they were deliberatly made with no remorse, no minds and no acting.  They were boring, montonious, laborious pieces of cardboard. Whenever they were on screen I felt like going to sleep - there was no real credible bad guy or a big name playing the bad guy - this let the film down (mind you so does the gratious overuse of cgi and gunfighting), the half-hearted ending of Keanu blocking every move that the bad guy did was too quick for me - it should have been one long fight sequence.At the end of the film, Reeves tells us he didn't want to tell us how this film ends - that's up to us - no it isn't, its up to the directors and producers who made this film and are planning the sequels.If a sequel is planned - more effort needs to be made on credible action sequences, credible bad guys and credible acting.Overall, the film is stunning to watch and if you ignore the complex plot you can enjoy a dark, cool attempt at a Hollywood made Hong Kong film with a lot of CGI.  I'd personally give this film a 7 but I felt so annoyed at the bad guys and the less then realistic action sequences I'll give it a 6 instead.",Null,0,0,12 June 1999
Windtalkers," Its not that bad. But its not that good.
","Contains SpoliersIn the current climate of war movies, nearly every war film has the same theme of brave soldiers facing unstopable and unpredicatble odds to face adversity. Perhaps Saving Private Ryan should take the flack for starting this. If we didn't the message that war is futile in Ryan, then we'll get it rammed down our throats in every other war film.John Woo films are incredibly poetic and perhaps brilliant. And this has all of Woo's mannerisims and direction style. I think he's showed critics that he isn't just a one trick pony churning out the same old action film but with a different plot.Sure the film is well shot and very poetic. Sure it has the Woo-isms of friendship, loyalty and the human spirit woven into the story. But, I dunno perhaps Woo's style doesn't fit the war movie.Sure the constant ambushes and the contininous explosions became repetitive, tedious and even boring. But that was the point. Its a war, not an action film. It distracts you long enough from Cage's character still disappointed at losing his platoon.Whilst we've seen this tired cliche done over and over and over again I think Cage handled it very well, until his *SPOILER* end scene where he goes into silly speak slowly whilst dying mode *END SPOILER*War does things to many people. Some run and cry. Some just run. Some like Sassoon and Owen realise the pointlessness and just how tedious and brutal war is. This film doesn't show the pointlessness of war. Rather its brutality.And whilst its commendable that Woo tackled a hard task such as the use of Native Americans in World War 2 I feel the film doesn't show both sides of the story. The Japanese or Japs come from all sides as if they are an invisible enemy or unknown enemy. They are human too.There are problems to the film, things which aren't wrapped up. For example the nurse who writes letters to Cage suddenly disappears. The ending should have been with her. How does she cope with Cage's war?This is an above-average war film with strong themes of friendship and loyalty. And perhaps you can see behind the explosions and the shrapnel to see the bad writing, the over the top acting of Cage and perhaps roll your eyes at how Cage doesn't seem to get hit whilst he takes out a platoon of Japanese soldiers.Its not a forgettable movie, but perhaps the sequence with Slater's character being killed could be the one sequence that is probably remembered the most.Overall: 6/10.",Null,0,0,5 September 2002
