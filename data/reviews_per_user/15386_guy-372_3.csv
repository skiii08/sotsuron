The Avengers," 7.6 For Non-Comic Book Fanatics
","7.6 For Non-Comic Book Fanatics. Although there are plenty of fantastical elements in this movie, this movie is an enjoyment. Although everyone who enjoys this movie will need to be willing to accept the fantastical elements of the characters and main plot points, this movie is successful because it is logical and reasonable beyond those openly accepted fantastical characters. The action is exciting, imaginative and well shown. But the greatest strength of the movie was the development of the characters. We didn't need to know the comic book facts about the characters to understand what was happening. Moreover, the characters had personality: they were reasonably complex and interacted with enough pressure against each other to understand them as more than just 'cardboard' comic book cut-outs. The highlight was the humoristic quips between the heroes. I recommend that you see this in the cinema in the 3-D version, as the 3-D is done well and not the over-the-top 3-D of yester-years. But see this with another person who enjoys fantastical stories.",8,2,6,1 May 2012
Black Swan," Drug induced script writing
","If you are stoned or enjoy depraved hallucinations, this might be your kind of movie. This is a twisted script of which the story typically seems more induced by drug use than by unique imaginative writing. The script constantly strays from reality into hallucinations similar to 'Mulholland Dr.' and the end of 'A Beautiful Mind'. We follow the daily life of a ballerina being chosen for the lead ballerina part at the company's new rendition of Swan Lake. The movie includes titillating scenes of drug use, homosexuality, murder and self-mutilations, based on the main character's mental problems and drug use. We want to feel empathetic for the character's mental problems, but unlike the movie 'A Beautiful Mind', this story never gives us a reason for the character's non-drugged hallucinations. It is presented so we naturally assume that what we are viewing is camera reality, only later to learn that it was tragic mental dysfunction-based hallucinations. We are tragically expected to believe that the character fatally stabbed herself and then twice perfectly danced ballet parts on stage before the blood showed and she collapsed with instant blood spread. The dancing artistry was enjoyable, aside from the hallucinations, the script was uncreative, but the acting was solid. But solid acting doesn't fix a sick script. Had this movie given us a reason for the woman's dysfunction and built it up, turning the movie into a tragedy, instead of an 'acid trip', the movie might have had a society strengthening reason to exist.",2,2,5,17 February 2011
Zombieland," Written Specifically for Junior High Boys
","So, if you are not a Jr. High boy or have the shallow mentality of Jr. High boy, you won't think it rates the 7.8 that it has on the day of this writing. It seems to be the undeveloped plot version of an arcade shooting game about killing zombies. The plot doesn't make any sense from beginning to end and the characters have no depth or attachment to reality. The guest appearance of Bill Murry added nothing to the movie, but it did caused me to want to re-watch some of his hits. The zombies in the movie seemed to be anywhere and everywhere with no rhyme or reason and the very few remaining living people magically appeared to be living safely in the immediate vicinity and availability of the zombies. There was no sign of dead people, like they had magically been beamed up by space aliens, yet technology remained intact and working, even weeks after zombies were everywhere.I strongly recommend you miss this movie, unless you are doing a party for Jr. High boys or have a sick one at home, like I do.",2,4,10,27 March 2010
