The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen....
","MAY BE SPOILERS!!!OK... so last night a friend came by and wanted to watch this movie. and while i don't like Emma Watson in any form at all i was up for it having never seen nor heard of this movie. Let me begin with the bad..Cinematography: WTF?! The camera work is college student level at best. And apparently the focus on their camera was broken or Barbara Walters was controlling it. They couldn't make a more out of focus blurry movie without covering the lens in vaseline. Directing: Was there a director? Shouldn't the director have caught the above mentioned camera issues? Or perhaps the indeterminate time-frame of the movie? Supposedly 91 or 92? Yet crackers 'low' was released in 93.. and is in the movie. As a director he could have repaired A lot of the horrible writing on the fly. In the scene where brad says to Charlie 'thanks for stopping them' And they left that hanging? They could have had Charlie just reply 'you should have stopped them, not me' something along those lines.. a MUCH better ending to that. Moving on...Writing: Boring bad dialog.. Emma Watson saying 'shag' at the football game.. i have never heard one single American kid use shag in the context she did there.. it would have been screw or bang.. never shag. Although there are some bright spots in the writing.. The 'i wish one of us had cancer so i wouldn't have to deal with this breakup' (para- phrasing) Is awesome and i will be using it.. Oh.. and Emma Watson being a 'wallflower,outcast' type kid.. please.. really? How bout stuck up snobby broad banging the football team. Bad casting, but thats just my opinion..And WTF is with Charlie shoveling snow in a small circle? in reallllly poorly done fake snow.. Also. a house like that with a 6 car garage and hes using a hand shovel to clear the driveway? Um... NO... By the end i was praying for Emma Watson to catch a low bridge when she was doing her titanic flying scene in the back of the truck... Nothing against her.. just would have made the movie much more interesting.I Realize i am not near the demographic that this movie was made for, I am assuming its for 13 year old shut-ins with mental issues and IQ's hovering well below triple digits. P.S. If they had ended the movie with Charlie eating a gun and the screen just goes black i would have liked this movie MUCH MUCH more.. but as every movie made now has to have all strings tied up and everyone lives happily ever after. we get what we get.Sorry for rambling.. still reeling from this being in my brain for the rest of my life.",1,11,31,29 May 2014
