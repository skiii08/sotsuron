Changeling," Words can not describe this film.
","All i can say is that it takes a lot for a film to really grasp me and i couldn't take my eyes off the screen for a second. This film is seriously deep and Clint Eastwood really has done an absolutely amazing job.I consider myself quite a tough young man (22 years old) and even i was sobbing at points. It's such an emotional film and done so well that it reached me on an entirely different level to most. The best true story and film i have ever seen, the acting was amazing and Angelina Jolie really took on the role perfectly. Also John Malkovich and all others involved performed brilliantly.The only down point i can think of about this masterpiece is that i might never enjoy another film in the same way.",10,3,5,12 February 2009
