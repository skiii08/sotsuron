Casablanca," The best love triangle movie
","`Here's to looking at you, kid' was probably the most overused line in the movie, but nevertheless, Casablanca was one of the best love triangle/war movies that I have ever seen.  The movie is set during WWII when people from Europe are traveling to Casablanca to try to get to America, where it was safer.  This was a very hard and risky thing to do. 	 Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman lit up the screen playing Rick Blaine, an exiled American and owner of a well-known cafe and Ilsa Lund laszlo, Rick's love interest that left him in Paris when she found out that her husband was alive. 	 Meeting in Paris, Rick and Ilsa fall in love and plan to spend the rest of their lives together, until Rick receives a letter from Ilsa before boarding a train saying that they can't ever see each other again.  Rick is torn apart, especially when he sees her again unexpectedly at his café and is obviously very bitter towards her.  He later finds out that she left him in Paris because she found out her husband was alive. 	 I really liked Humphrey Bogart in this movie.  He played the bad boy, which seems to be a reoccurring role in the older classic films.  Although he was perceived as a rebel who `doesn't stick his neck out for no one', he was the kind of guy who would do the right thing in the end that was best for everyone.  I think he's a great actor who delivers his lines well and makes the scene seem very realistic. 	 I thought that the movie was well done.  The were many scenes in which there was mostly talking and a lot of information was given at one time making the movie somewhat confusing at times, but for the most part it was a great film.  There were many parts that movies today copy, which made the movie interesting to watch.  Although I am not a big fan of war/love movies, I thought that this was a classic because of Bogart and Bergman's incredible performances.  Even the corniest parts such as the flashbacks and the famous line, `Here's to looking at you kid' were well done. 	 Everyone should see this movie at least once; it's a classic that has been an inspiration to many filmmakers for many years.",Null,0,1,29 April 2004
Citizen Kane," an example of a unique and well done movie
","The movie Citizen Kane was loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst. The movie begins with the death of Charles Foster Kane, who was the editor of the New York Journal.  He says the name rosebud and drops a crystal ball, which falls to the ground a shatters.  News clips are shown about the different occurrences in Kane's life depicting how Kane acquired his fortune.  Throughout the whole movie reporters are trying to figure out what the word rosebud meant and why it was the last word he said before he died.  The reporters find people who knew Kane throughout his life trying to get information from them that would put some sense to Kane saying `rosebud' as his last word.  Many of the stories told by the people interviewed show the audience a lot about his life through flashbacks. One of the opening scenes is that of Kane's mansion called Xanadu.  It has a sign that says `no trespassing' that is hung from the outside gate.  The shot is very dark and gloomy, hinting that maybe Kane's life was the same way.  He was a very power-hungry man that went from being at the top to rock bottom.  Many other movies have definitely taken note to style and effects of this movie.  The camera work, lighting, acting a music contributed to making Citizen Kane one of the best American movies of all time.  Orson Welles deserves all the credit that he receives from this movie.  He was the leading character, producer and director; basically a one man show that still many of us appreciate.  I thought that this movie was well done.  It had so much symbolism that made the movie unique, although if you didn't know what was symbolic during the different scenes it would be hard to follow, but most of the symbolism is easily recognized.  One of the best symbolic scenes that also foreshadows is when Kane is at the top of the stairs and he is told that he lost his position and as he walks down the stairs the camera is shooting from at the top and it looks like a spiral showing that Kane's life and career are out of control.  Citizen Kane was very dramatic and all who took part in the movie played their roles well.  The characters seemed very real and believable making this movie very memorable.  This film has features that every movie should try to incorporate; symbolism, great actors, interesting storyline, excellent camera shots, lighting and sound techniques.  I think everyone should see this movie at least once in their life time because it is one of the greatest American movies of all time.",Null,141,251,17 November 2003
Some Like It Hot," Predictable, but silly
","It was hard to believe all that Some Like It Hot' got away with in the 1950's. Sexual innuendos, cross-dressing, barely their `clothes' and more definitely made it an eyebrow-raising movie.  It was risqué, but it's what made it such a funny movie.  Marilyn Monroe did as excellent job at playing a dumb blonde (If she was really acting at all) and Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon did a superb job playing two cross-dressers trying to win a pretty girl's heart.  Marilyn Monroe played a sweet, innocent girly-girl in an all-female band who every guy wanted, especially Joe and Jerry (Curtis and Lemmon).  The two struggling musicians meet Sugar (Monroe) after they witness the St. Valentines Day Massacre and need to flee from the mob that is out to kill them.  The only way to escape from being killed is to cross-dress and join the all-female band.  The idea isn't too bad when they find out that Sugar is apart of the band.  The girls in the band seem fresh out of seventh grade: boy-crazy and naïve, though it didn't seem to bother Joe and Jerry whose alias' while being cross-dressers where Josephine and Daphne.  Even though the two guys were trying to win over Sugar while somehow remaining cross-dressers, it seemed to me that they were having a little more fun playing dress up than other guys would.  I think they became too comfortable as women and it was kind of creepy, but also very humorous.  While Jerry was having more success getting closer to Sugar and becoming more of her confidante, Joe was having more success in unintentionally wooing a rich yacht owner named Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown).  This twisted comedy made me laugh the whole way through.  The mishaps and misfortunes of the characters were very inventive.  I thought that the ending was very witty and although I could see the direction that it was headed, I didn't think any other ending would have been as funny. Although, it didn't take incredibly talented actors to pull off a comedy such as Some Like It Hot', it is still a movie that I would watch again and again.",Null,1,3,25 May 2004
It's a Wonderful Life," A classic
","It's a Wonderful Life makes us think about our own life and how we shouldn't take it for granted.  It makes us realize what the important things are around the holidays.  The movie is about George Bailey (Jimmy Stuart), a business man who takes over a bank after his father, the previous owner dies.  What he really wanted to do with his life was get out of Bedford Falls, the small town he grew up in, and make a name for himself. After misplacing an $8,000 loan, he contemplates about committing suicide, but instead saves his guardian angel when he falls into a river.  Gabriel, the angel, gives George a look at what life would be like if he had never been born.  I thought that this was a great movie.  The acting was great, and the love story wasn't corny.  Stuart could portray so many different types of emotions that made the story seem real.  You see his character develop from being an optimist, wanting to get out and see the world, to a desperate business man confused about what the real meaning of life is. Donna Reid played her character well also.  She was Mary Bailey and always was by her husband's side being very supportive.  At the beginning of the movie she was portrayed as a young girl in love with George and as the movie progressed she matured and became a loving wife and a mother.  Reid and Stuart together made the movie as memorable as it is.  They had great chemistry onscreen, which made the movie real and not corny.  I liked how it was still in black and white and not colored and taken away from its original form.  The colored versions of black and white movies just don't look as good as the originals.  I would recommend this movie to almost anyone, especially those who think that they don't have anything to be grateful for or who can't seem to get into the Christmas spirit.",Null,0,4,16 December 2003
Psycho," a classic and creative film
","Psycho has to be one of the best and most classic horror films of all time. Alfred Hitchcock was very smart and creative about the techniques that he used which is why they have become a major part in filmmaking today.The movie starts out with Marion (Janet Leigh) and her boyfriend Sam (John Gavin) in a hotel room.  She wants to marry Sam, but neither of them have the money, especially Sam; he had to give most of his money away in alimony. When Marion goes to work, her boss asks her to deposit $40,000.  Knowing that she could start a new life with the large sum of money, Marion takes off with it and the suspense begins. While she is driving down the road, the camera zooms in very close to her face, making it awkward for the audience and the screen seems to get tighter and tighter and with the terrifying music playing it has you on the edge of your seat.  Not all of the techniques that Hitchcock uses are technical; a lot of what makes this such a great movie is all the twists in the storyline.  When Marion arrives at the hotel she is staying at there is a huge mansion in the background that appears to be very spooky.  The camera shoots up at it making the viewer feel very small and intimidated.  The shadows that are seen behind the curtains were a great effect and added to the spookiness of the movie.  I thought that the music was one of the best techniques. A movie isn't scary unless it has the right music.  I'm sure the audience could tell that he must have been a perfectionist; there was so much effort put in to this movie beyond what most would expect.   There is so much to discuss about this movie, especially the end, but I don't want to give it away.  I would rate Psycho 10/10.  It was truly a classic in it's time as well as it is today.",Null,0,1,20 February 2004
Rear Window," Great actors, great plot, great story....
","Rear Window is a classic suspense movie without all the blood and guts.The whole plot takes place inside L.B. `Jeff' Jeffries (James Stuart) New York apartment.  He is recovering from a broken leg and is confined to his wheel chair.  Trying to get through the days while not doing much besides visiting with his Stella (Thelma Ritter) his nurse and Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly) his girlfriend, he looks through the rear window to his apartment and observes his neighbors in the apartments across the courtyard. Miss Torso, Miss Loneyheart, a composer, newlyweds and a bickering couple captures his attention and Jeff is soon caught up in his neighbors' lives noticing the odd things that they do day by day.  One day he notices that the wife of the man across the courtyard is no longer in the apartment and the man is packing her things.  Jeff also notices that his strange neighbor is coming home at odd hours of the night with knives and ropes.  Soon Jeff becomes suspicious thinking that a murder has just been committed across from his own apartment. Hitchcock used a lot of symbolism throughout the movie.  When Miss Lonelyheart was depressed, she would be on the lower floor of the apartment, but when she became happier she would go to the higher floors of the apartment building.  The apartment of the suspicious neighbor was dark and uninviting.  The music from the composer's apartment would always start to play when Jeff and Lisa would talk about the suspicious neighbor.  It was very interesting to look for the symbolism throughout the movie because it took the theme of the movie to a deeper level.  Also, when Jeff is looking into all the different apartment buildings he seeing more than neighbors go through their daily tasks: he's seeing different stages of people lives.  I think that is what makes this movie so interesting and captivating in a way. Hitchcock's movies have multiple levels. I would rate this movie 10/10.  It is definitely something everyone should see.",Null,1,3,1 March 2004
The Godfather," More movies should have these qualities
","The Godfather, which hit movie theatres and wowed audiences over 30 years ago, is still arguably one of the best movies ever made.  Only the best writers, directors and actors could make a story about the mafia, who in the beginning seem to be cold, ruthless killers, and turn it into a group of people winning over the sympathy of nearly everyone in the audience.  This film wouldn't have been as believable or worth watching if it weren't for the great cast.  Their acting drew people into the movie.  Marlon Brando, who played Don Vito Corleone, was introduced to the audience as the Godfather', the leader of the organized crime family.  I loved how he was portrayed as an intimidating leader, but had a softer side for his grandchildren and his son, Michael, who he had a close relationship with. Throughout the movie, negotiations are made, bold-faced lies are told, families are torn apart, and several people are killed.  At the beginning of the movie, the viewer feels sympathy for Michael Corleone because he seems confused and not sure if he wants to join the business.  He makes up his mind to be apart of the business that will soon consume his life and because of that he changes as a person and the viewer no longer seems to identify with Michael and they feel a little bitter towards him.  He looses respect from the audience.  The camera angles added more attitude to the movie, giving it more symbolism. Sometimes the viewer is frustrated with the actors, knowing that if they had just made a different choice, things would have turned out the way the viewer wanted them to.  That's another thing that caught my attention during this film; I found myself upset with the characters and disappointed in them as if they were actual people.  I think that is a great quality in a movie.   I really liked how the viewer's feelings for Michael changed in the end.  It's a nice surprise when movies throw something like that in to spice things up and make the audience hope for a sequel.",Null,0,2,21 May 2004
