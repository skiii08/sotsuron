"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Those who whine about Pegg's writing should learn to read
","First off, I thought this movie was quite good. But setting that aside, I just wanted to comment on a couple of the comments that were criticizing Pegg and putting this film in the same category as Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and Spaced.This film was directed by David Schwimmer. It was written by Michael Ian Black. This is NOT a Simon Pegg/Edgar Wright film or a Pegg/Stevenson series. Trying to compare them is akin to comparing The Royal Tenenbaums to Shanghai Knights; sure both featured Owen Wilson, but he was only creatively involved in one. Separating the faces from the actual creators is pretty important in this context...So for those commenting on how Pegg is losing it or that this is a poor British film, I would point out two things--1) Pegg had nothing to do with its content, and 2) it is NOT a British Film, unless Schwimmer and Black have moved to the UK in the past year...As to the creative team themselves, Schwimmer did a pretty decent job behind the camera, getting solid performances from both Pegg and Moran. Black, who if you don't recognize click the handy link under 'writer', has a very, um, 'unique' sense of humor and style that I personally enjoy, but in the same breath there is a reason that Stella was not a huge success. It's very specific, and you either love it or hate it.Personally, I tend to fall into the former category.",8,6,10,24 September 2007
