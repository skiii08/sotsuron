The Ring," Distinctly average
","Maybe i should not have seen this movie as i have seen the original trilogy before..but i still entered the theatre with an open mind..yet walked out with mixed feelings. By no means is this a bad movie. In fact, it has some inspired additions from the original movie that embellished the story. but plot wise, tension wise and momentum wise, a lot was lost. of course, if you have never seen the original, you might just think this movie is just as good as you could ever hope, and maybe you will tell your friends how scary it is. Its obvious to say a remake is not as good as the original, but this really underlines the point. I cannot go into details without spoiling it, (check my message board comments after youve seen it) but i would urge everyone to at least check out the original. It will scare you much more than this attempt could ever hope for. 5.",Null,0,0,21 February 2003

","If you understood my summary line, then you'll get this movie. There has been reviews for this that have painted this movie as exceptional and a must see movie, and they would be right, but i would like to point out two things. One, you will understand it, and that realisation when it comes will put a huge smile on your face, as when the movie plays, (and it does play backwards in segments that link together) you start to figure it out. The other is that it has no resemblance to The sixth sense whatsoever. When it comes to plot twists, i would compare it more to The usual suspects. What we have here is a truly unique movie, one that cannot be faulted in any department, which, due to the nature of the story, will have you on tenterhooks til its closing (or opening) frame. I simply cannot recommend this movie enough, and if you feel im not writing much on its story its because its hard to talk about the plot without giving it all away, and it IS better if you figure it out for yourself. So read no more reviews, get the movie, heat the popcorn, and enjoy...the conversations after the movie will be intense...",10,0,2,5 May 2001
