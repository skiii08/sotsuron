The Sound of Music," when you think about soothing classic movie
","unlike most of movies addicts, I didn't grow up with the melody of the sound of music around me. In fact, I watch it pretty recently because of it overwhelm reputation. once my eyes dropped on the movie the first impression was a very relaxing sensation and joyful adrenaline ran through my veins, especially with it's first amazing shout screenplay, and Marie singing 'the mountain are alive' which to be honest reminded me instantaneously of Moulin Rouge which a very dear movie for me too. Stepping out of the first impression, It would be banal if I would spend lines describing the perfection of the Director, writers, and the composer of the music.instead I prefer to put down my one point of view right away. and as a modern movie watcher, I would say that Sound of music is an impressive classical American movie. and I totally agree with the Oscar not choosing the actors for the prize, because I think the movie had a some sort of deficiency on this specific aspect, the character were definitively well composed but we might figured that they would apply much better to a theatrical performance, of course I'm not saying that out of lack of classical movies interest, because i don't think that anyone can compare the characters of the sound of music with the ones in 'a streetcar named desire' or 'Casablanca' or 'vertigo'. that would be the only thing that sort of annoyed me in this movie. After all, the sound of music is a musical, and indeed a successful one, it's a cultural element that whole families grew up with, especially because the movie is very popular among kids.",3,6,24,12 January 2012
The Young Victoria," delightful courtesy
","the most noticeable thing in the young Victoria is its majestic decorum and vividness. The movie reflect the very first years of the longest lived heirs of the English crown., and since youth was the subject matter of the movie it was colored likewise. quiet cheerful romantic and rebellious and different parts of it as the queen reject the regency to govern her country on behalf of her and stood up to take her own responsibly, she insisted talking to her husband Albert' if there are any mistakes to be make, they will be my mistakes and no one else, no one, not even you' . we could see that the movie tend to be a tribute to her majesty more than taking side for any ideological point of view. so Mr Vallé occupied himself by depicting the grandeur and beauty of such life. too flawless and simple that's my judgment as a critic, Vallé movie can a show as that we might have an accomplished work without making it too complicated or dense, without getting ridiculous. yet, the only thing that could be taken on the young Victoria is that it might got too romantic, for handling a life of such a historical figure should be rather more serious, it's true we saw some drama here and there with the gun shot and the regency issue, but it did not get the attention it provokes. However, it can be claimed that the main point and why it got so agreeable, it makes history simple and figuratively interesting to all new student and those interseted on that era.",7,1,1,30 October 2012
Shine," massive talent in fragile hands
","shine is one of the most precious movies for me, i loved it from the first sight, its screen making, acting, cast, plot, every thing is just perfect, and above all how the writer and the director handle to express such intrigued element as the sensitive characters as David Helpoffgot. the movies is very rich in the thematic perspective, at first we have David and his father relationship, a point that explain a great deal of each of both character and their psychology. David's father is a authoritative patriarchal sort of character, that can never let anything pass its borders unmarked, that's how he express all his emotion in this display of aggressive power, like his love to his son he says;'non one ever loves you more than me', to his family which he want to fix it in one dimension forever. on the other hands, we see David naturally as a fragile quite child, music is his talent and his sentimental outbreak, but some time i wander whether was his father shades on him that makes piano is the only personal expression for him. i believe that David's sensitivity and fragility is tidily linked with his musical talent; music is a powerful mean of human soul out release, it 'express so completely the inexpressible' that the human heart is capable of. In contrast, we got David Helpoffgot who got this talent of musical performance,his overwhelm sensitivity is so delicate to a point that he can not merely contact to the out side world but by the music help. David fallowed his teacher's advice when he told him to 'to play like there is no tomorrow', may be he did not realize that he was giving it just to the right person, because there was practically no tomorrow when David had unified with his music, and show us why pure human sentiments can not be reflected in the material world? because it's just the opposite of it. yet David dealt with it, and till now i'm most grateful for the writer to show us simply how this creature could live with such enormous power of sentiment. the uniqueness of shine that unlike all other biographical movies that it does not tells us about rising talent as usual, but about falling one. a thing more common in our unfair world than the successful ones. Finally i'm bound to comment of the last scene of the piano concert, who he manage to defeat his past, his fear and play again. his tears tell us with precious understatement that all that the real talent want on earth is the recognition of the other.",8,2,4,23 December 2011
Ray," Don't let anyone turns you to cripple...
","Ray is a deep psychological reflection on the life of the American jazz musician Ray Charles. The movie is no doubt a hit, in spit of all prejudices that precede it. For in 2 and half hours the filmmaker managed to put not only the story of a struggling man from the scum of the world to the very top, but he shows us too the birth of a new music, and the creation and unfold of a very intrigued psychological complex. So in the end of the day we might have to admit that Ray is a whole rounded cinema production.As Jamie Foxx heading the cast and Taylor Hockford and James L. White as directors and writers, it's a movie that promises great deal, still it got its fair share of obstacles, for the movie has been rejected many times by the producing companies and that led to delay it for 2 years, a thing which personally stupefied me due to the apparent importance of the figure in question, let aside the well written scripts of the film. The movie deals with the raise of Ray Charles career, and his childhood which constructs fundamentally his character; starting with his mum strength,learning piano, his brother death whose guilt he'll bear for so long, and finally his eyes going blind. As most of the biopics, we got all these facts by the flashback techniques through out the movie. We'll witness too how this legendary musician sink into heroin addiction, fought back for his people and his own rights, and above all how he managed to cherish and forge his own music, which was regarded at first as sinful. At last, Hockford preferred to end his movie at the coming back home stage of Ray's life, where from he has been banded to sing after he refused once to sing in a segregated concerto.Concerning Mr. Foxx, we should applaud him for his role which he bayed a great tribute, it was admiring how he managed to unified himself with the character and giving us the real flavor of Ray Charles. I can't think of better performance to the character, Foxx played most of the piano pieces of the movie, a thing that would lead us to think that his passion was so positively influential. There are on doubt other things distinguished the movie such as Whites' screenplay which was admiringly vivid and expressive. The cast as whole was clearly very committed. I think one of Rays' most effective hits was that it got to introduce us not only to the jazz music, for the movies is evidently filled up with it, but in one way or another it explained the context of the growth of this music.Ray 2004 is the only cinema production dedicated to the African American musician Ray Charles and his works. So if you needed something soothingly inspiring go watch this movie, and if you already been through it, I'd still recommend you to go and take another look in it.What really we like about the biopics is that they give us a cold shiver, they tell us explicitly, rather intimately what life means, and how we might react towards it. Ray mum's said to him once 'remember! You might be blind but you ain't stupid', a metaphoric phrase that could bear a lot of analysis for all men are blind of experience but we are human beings we're by nature a claver species. Life condition may vary and battle fields may change, but mankind will always be the same. For that, successful biographical productions would always inspire us not hope, but courage to stand up to life and fall, and stand up again and fall again, and stand up again and fall again because that's the way it is.",8,0,1,16 April 2012
