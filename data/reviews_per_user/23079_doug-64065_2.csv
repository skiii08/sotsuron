The Lobster," Cellouid Suicide. No value to life perspective.
","As credits were running and Lobster viewers were exiting the theater, an attendant was standing by the door. He asked the exiting audience how the movie was. This proved to be the most beneficial moment in the last 2 hours; as a collective we were able to vent our disgust. Indeed,the film served to bind us as an audience with the common denominator being our shared theatrical abuse.This is more than a poor movie, it is an in-your-face, full frontal assault to any sense of moral and intellectual value. No compass whatever. In a poor movie I can find redeeming value --- a comfortable seat, some popcorn and maybe a little sleep. This was too terrible to nap although I've never wanted to close my eyes so hard.Gratuitous violence with un-deeming value includes (CAUTION HERE): Donkey getting shot. Dog kicked to death with image of dog's intestines on floor. Person bound and dropped into open grave with dogs to devour face (dogs have collars on?). Hand forced into toaster. Lips getting sliced with razor blade. Forced (and optional?) blindness.A unique movie but only by way of its horrorableness.In the imagined words of Nurse Ratched this is 'The perfect movie for the cinemaly insane.'",1,108,191,6 June 2016
The Conjuring 2," Conjuring double feature - opening night theater experience.
","Wanted to share the Conjuring's opening night theater experience...Conjuring 1 at 5PM was good even with plot holes big enough for a casket. I screamed once and did the dead frog electrode thing a number of times. I understand it was the highest grossing horror movie ever at well over $300M. Hard to figure when it was just me and one other guy at the theater. Fool 'em once, can't fool 'em twice I guess. They showed the double feature in one of their smaller theaters (#11). Conjuring 2 was to follow in #11 as well.Had some ginger snaps and small drink for part 1 (brought Ginger Snaps with me). Left at intermission to get something more to eat. Came back and was working my way back to #11 but an usher blocked my path and said the manager wanted to see me. (All this over Ginger Snaps???)Was told projector broke and part 2 was going to be in their 'Premium Theater' where seats cost $19.95. Described it like an IMAX (they have one of those as well). Manager said to go back to #11 and pick up my stuff but I asked him if okay to get new. As they did not have Ginger Snaps, I settled for a small drink. Got to pick my seat off a selection screen. No charge for drink or upgrade to first class!Conjuring 2 was excellent. No one or nothing dies (including the dog which cannot be said for the dark 'comedy' Lobster). Well written, good dialog, lots of slower parts for recovery then a scare again. Even lots of LOL humor. And the scary parts were well crafted. My back and knees are sore this morning. These were launch popcorn roof high scares. The audience loved it and applauded afterwards even staying for most of the credits. Great evening, especially with the never had happen before, first class upgrade! About time though, I've certainly accumulated the miles (and hours).Cheers to Good Movies Nights!
