Iron Man 3," This is a movie about Tony Stark rather than IronMan
","We have seen what the Ironman is capable of in Ironman1, ironman2 and The Avengers. His powers, intelligence, attitude and so on. But in this movie we see the weaknesses of him and how he overcomes them to save the world and live up to his name. I would say that this movie is a Marvel version of The Dark Knight Rises. The movie is good in its own way but has a few flaws like the weak ironman suits, tony stark's stupid idea of announcing his address to the world so that the enemy can attack him, tony's negligence causing him to be the root cause to the origin of the Mandarin, making ironman look so beatable in the action sequences etc. Except for these flaws the movie is great!",7,1,2,25 August 2013
Now You See Me," This movie was such a great thriller!
","This movie exceeded my expectations! Munch thought has gone into the script and it gives us the right thrills, keeps our eyes glued to the screen and keeps us guessing till the end! Great casting and acting- not even a single bad character was there in it! Jesse eisenberg, mark ruffalo, michael caine and morgan freeman- these four actors have added life to their characters and deserve a special mention. The dialogues are good in many scenes. With magic as a theme- it is really a challenging job to create the illusions in many scenes. Using the concept of magic- this movie does create 'magic' on the screen! Don't miss it! You really need to see him!",8,1,5,25 August 2013
