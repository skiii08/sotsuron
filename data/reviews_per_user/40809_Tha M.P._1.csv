The Blair Witch Project," One of the scariest movies ever made - but different...
","Seems like this comment section of BWP grew into a serious discussion board ;) So, it's time for me to say what I think of that movie now... ;-))I have seen this movie yesterday evening on video...damn me, that I did not went to the movies to see it in '99!! It's for sure one of scariest movies ever produced. Those guys in here who say it isn't scary at all - can only be little kiddies (or childish people let's say) who think that a movie is only scary when you can see lots and lots of blood. Of course BWP is a very different movie...ATMOSPHERE is all this movie lives from - that scary and REALISTIC atmosphere I have never seen before. The movie makers, all newcomers in the business, did their best to create a perfect illusion. Everybody should take a look at the Blair Witch website, too - because there it's continued - especially in the 'Blair Witch Archives'. If you have read this you finally think that everything is true and did really happen - if you did not already thought that after watching the film.OK, some problems of the movie are of a technical nature...e.g. you turn up the volume to hear the witches sounds and in the next moment heather starts to scream - ugh, my eardrums *lol* But summarized I have to say, the producers of this film did create a scary movie, with lots of tension of a curious nature - and that with almost no budget...respect!The Blair Witch Project is a movie you sure want to see and you should see...oh, and I recommend to watch it with the girl you love in a dark, dark night ;)8/10",Null,0,1,18 August 2000
