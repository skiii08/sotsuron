Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Upon second viewing, disappointing
","I greatly enjoyed Kill Bill Vol 1 and would happily give it a 9 out of 10. It had the right combination of goofiness and real action.  I watched the Volume 1 DVD the night before I saw Vol 2 in the theatre, so I was all primed.  While I did not like it as much as Volume 1, I thought that Volume 2 was pretty decent after the first viewing.  I enjoyed David Carradine, Michael Madsden was excellent and the Kiddo/Elle fight was pretty good.  I felt the ending dragged, but I was willing to put up with that as a change of pace. I still would have graded it an 8 out of 10 at that point.After watching the DVD of Vol 2, I really have to downgrade my rating to a 6 or less.  Bill really gets BORING!  Now I know why Kiddo left him--she couldn't stand any more of those long-winded stories of his.  There's nothing wrong with long stretches of dialogue if the characters have something to say.  Bill's philosophical ramblings collapse under their own weight.  They certainly cannot be supported by the plot and characterizations of either Kill Bill volume, unless they were cut down to about 1/3 their length, and then we would have been left with very little movie.I'll be re-watching the Volume 1 DVD from time to time, while Volume 2 collects dust.  Let's call it 5 out of 10.  That doesn't make the 6 out of 10 needed for repeat viewing.",Null,4,7,23 August 2004
Requiem for a Dream," OK, but nothing special..
","After reading many of the comments here, I thought this film would be truly incredible.  It was OK, but way too gimmicky and ultimately boring, with the exception of Ellen Burstyn's character.  It was a little hard to sympathize with such losers, especially the younger 3 characters.  Seems their big dream was to make enough money from drug sales so that they could buy even more drugs.  Wow!  The film goes exactly where you expect it to, no surprises.  As soon as I saw the infection in the main character's arm, it was obvious what would happen and it did.  It was OK for a single viewing, but nothing here to come back to a second time. 3 of 5 stars and that's generous.",Null,0,1,19 July 2004
Casablanca," A great love triangle--Bogart, Bergman and ---Rains
","After who knows how many viewings, the scenes with Claude Rains still are the most entertaining for me.  Rains would have stolen the movie, if the rest of the cast had not been so good.  He has many of the really good lines.  We have two love triangles in this film.  The classic Rick--Ilsa--Victor one and the more interesting Rick--Ilsa--Louis. The non-traditional ending is one of the most satisfying in films.  As Louie says, 'Who is Rick?  Why, if I were a woman, and I were not around, I should be in love with Rick'.   Just a beautiful friendship.",10,3,3,8 May 2002
The Birth of a Nation," Good start but degrades into lurid melodrama
","I have watched this film several times over the years, and I find the second half dealing with reconstruction a little harder to watch each time. Although its racist viewpoint may have mirrored much of America in 1915, it obviously was not the only viewpoint, since America had its abolitionists in the early 1800s.  Griffith endorses just about every wretched stereotype put forth by the south during and after reconstruction, namely the venality of all northerners and the baseness of all blacks who did not completely bow to whites.  A good example is that the disdainful depiction of the black-run state legislature is based on a cartoon, not an actual photograph or contemporary description.  Griffith's portrayal of northerners and blacks is completely from the point of view of a white southern racist.  Although I greatly admire much of his work, he deserved the criticism he got for this film.  Aside from the political racism, much of the second half of the film is just silly melodrama, even based on 1915 standards and other Griffith work.",Null,83,141,7 July 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," If you've seen the trailer, you've seen it
","Well, now I know the difference between a 70's disaster movie and one from 2004:  About 6 bucks in the ticket price.  Acting was decent, some of the special effects were well done, main plot was largely unbelieveable but not too terrible, subplots were warmed over Airport/Poseidon Adventure. I expected to see Gene Hackman and Shelly Winters climb out of the ship that parks in front of the New York Library.  Speaking as one, I will be surprised if this wins over any converts to global warming.  All the best effects are in the trailer--that's all you need to see.  Good to see Ian Holm--he's always good--but largely wasted here. 4 out of 10",Null,0,0,28 May 2004
Lost in Translation," Different viewer reactions might be age based
","Most people seem to really like this film OR be unimpressed by it.  I wonder if the reactions are based on the age of the viewer.  I am a big Bill Murray fan and I think he did a nice job here with the material.  At least the viewer had something to connect to with Murray--his career and family.  We are given very little as a foundation for Johanssons's character--she's really just a kid--maybe spoiled, maybe not.  She is not articulate enough to describe her feelings, beyond a general loneliness, and does not serve as an effective foil for Murray to express his own sadness.  In fact, we learn virtually nothing new about these characters from their interaction. Everything about them is given to us in scenes where they are alone or interacting with others.  The stranger in a strange land theme is very common and this film says nothing new about it.  Without Murray, this would have been a total loss in my opinion.  With him, 5 out of 10.",Null,0,1,5 July 2004
Van Helsing," Cartoon characters
","I knew there was a good chance this movie would be disappointing, but being a fan of the vampire genre I had to check it out. On the good side:  Stylish sets, some good music, a somewhat interesting Frankenstein monster (we've seen this interpretation before, but still OK), pretty good werewolves.  On the bad side:  idiotic dialogue, uninteresting main characters, music often too loud and intrusive, CGI way overused (it has a long way to go before it replaces a good makeup job), terrible Dracula character (kind of a discount Gary Oldman), and ludicrous situations (even for a monster mash movie like this).  The worst thing about the movie is that the main characters (Van Helsing and Anna) are just as cartoonish as the CGI characters.  How many times can we watch them be smashed through walls or fall hundreds of feet and just get up and brush themselves off, before we stop taking them seriously?    I guess I got my money's worth, but I could easily have lived without it.",Null,0,0,12 May 2004
Face_Off," Idiotic
","This is an incredibly stupid film.  When it was over I was actually p**sed off.  How is anyone supposed to take this film seriously as a thriller or action movie?  The idea had some potential but the execution was ludicrous. I guess we're supposed to believe that FBI agents normally know how to waterski barefooted and that faces can be transferred back and forth like Halloween masks.  Definitely gets the 'I can't believe they made this movie' award. 
I don't know what else to say about this movie to fill 10 lines.  I have enjoyed John Woo's other movies, but this one is ripe. Did I mention this was a stupid movie?",Null,0,2,21 July 2004
Independence Day," Doesn't hold up well on repeat viewings
","I enjoyed this in the theatre the first time and bought the DVD.  I don't think the film holds up well on repeat viewing.  Once you know the plot, the characters have to carry the film and they are just way too cardboard.  This also falls into the class of movie where the technical solution is so complex (like Space Cowboys, Armegeddon, Face Off) and unlikely, you just sit back and say--yeah--whatever--it's obviously going to work out fine, no matter how unlikely, which really reduces the suspense.  Still, it's fun the first time through.",Null,1,2,8 May 2002
Alien vs. Predator," Better than I had any right to hope
","I go with the group that came away pleasantly surprised.  This could easily have been far worse.  Good points:  Coherent plot that does not try to tie into the previous films; excellent alien monsters and queen;  loved the predator's bad attitude; Lance Hendriksen; a couple of good showdowns between the predators and aliens.  Bad points:  The whole rest of the cast; many of the early predator/alien contacts too jumpy--I just HATE those quick cuts; too few really good encounters--I felt a little cheated that the movie wasn't longer with a few more good one on ones between aliens and predators. Certainly not as good as Alien 2, but for my money, at least as good as any of the Predator movies.  I don't think you'll be disappointed unless you really have you mind set against it.",Null,0,0,15 August 2004
Mystic River," What about that ending??
","Spoilers**  I enjoyed this movie quite a bit.  Despite the number of somewhat contrived connections among the characters, this was still a realistic drama about real people in a credible situation.  I thought all the actors were excellent and I am not usually a Sean Penn or Tim Robbins fan.**SPOILERS AHEAD**  I see that many of the reviewers here were upset about the ending.  I was too.  At first sight, it appears that the Kevin Bacon character, the detective, is letting his childhood friend, Sean Penn, get away with the murder of their mutual childhood friend, Tim Robbins.  I have to believe that when Bacon makes a shooting gesture at Penn, that he is saying, 'I'm going to get you', and Penn's return gesture of spreading his hands is saying, 'Hey, do what you gotta do'.  Otherwise, the ending truly IS repulsive.  The reason I go with my interpretation is that Bacon's partner, Fishburne, would not let it go.  Yes, maybe Bacon did not tell him about his last conversation with Penn, but Fishburne was a little more tenacious than that.",Null,0,0,13 July 2004
The Shawshank Redemption," You've got to be kidding me (but I know you're not)...
","I am dumbfounded by the exorbitant praise for this movie. It is almost frightening--like a cult.  I watched it last night and was completely underwhelmed.  This did not have have half the emotional charge of a dozen other prison flicks, not to mention other dramatic categories.  Yes, the story was OK, good (not great) acting, but I found it to be largely insipid and predictable.  It just did not grab me like other stories of redemption such as A Christmas Carol or It's a Wonderful Life.  As you can see by my citing these two films, I am not offended by cheesy sentimentality, if well done.  Shawshank simply had nothing new to say or a new way to say it.  The only reason I am writing this review is to demonstrate that there are indeed some people who are not swept away by this movie.  Otherwise, I would not have bothered.  The film simply was not interesting enough.",Null,1,2,8 July 2004
Tombstone," Best combination of entertainment and historical accuracy
","I rate this as the best Wyatt Earp movie as far as combining entertainment with historical accuracy.  The gunfight 'on the same block as OK Corral' had many witnesses and is as well documented as any 30 second event with a lot of shooting can be.  I saw nothing in the film that contradicted written reports or court records.  The aftermath of the gunfight has always been open to controversy and the events in the movie, with the exception of Ringo's fate, are not outlandish.  Costner's Earp may have been closer to the true Earp persona, but it's just not as entertaining.  Kilmer, as mentioned by many, is great.  His relationship to Wyatt is just as touching but not nearly so somber and melancholy as the Costner--Quaid one.  For my money, Sam Elliott nearly steals the movie.  There will never be a better Virgil. This film is right up there with Unforgiven and Silverado as one of the best of the modern westerns.",10,0,0,2 May 2002
Trainspotting," Good dialog but just doesn't connect with me
","We have a group of young male friends that include 2 sociopaths (Sick Boy and Begbie),a dimwit (Spud), and two fairly normal guys, Tommy, and the main protagonist, 'Rent Boy' (McGregor). All except Begbie are heroin users, which is portrayed as an alternative to lower middle class 'normal' life in Scotland. Tommy decides to give drugs a try and quickly comes down with AIDS. Begbie (Carlyle)is a really distasteful violent criminal with no redeeming qualities. The other characters are interesting due to the dialog rather than anything inherent in their characters. Anyone who likes dark British humor (eg, Naked) will find this entertaining, at least to a point, as I did. There is some very funny dialog, as when the boys are out on a scenic countryside walk and one exclaims that the air is so clean, and another replies that when you live in a 'shite' country like Scotland, the clean air don't enter into it. Rent Boy tries to get clean, gets a job, but is ultimately pulled back into the crime and drug scene by his friends. Whether he ultimately escapes is anyone's guess. At the end of the film, my feeling was similar to the one I had for Requiem for a Dream-- namely, things evolve pretty much as you would expect for a group of heavy drug users. Trainspotting, however, has far better dialog than Requiem which really carries the film, although I did not find any of the characters interesting in themselves. I give this a 7 out of 10. Like Requiem, many people are awed by this film, but I don't think this has much repeat viewing potential for me.",Null,0,3,11 August 2004
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," A fantastic series of set pieces
","While I like many of the Coen brothers films, there are quite a number that I don't care for.  O Brother ranks near the top for me and is one of my all time favorites although I really did not appreciate it the first time through.  I think some of the comments regarding the plot lapses are valid, but for me they are beside the point.  This film is one incredible series of set pieces with three terrific characters at their center:  Clooney, Turturro and Nelson.  Each one does a great job with their character.  Once you've seen the film at least two times, you can jump in at any point and just enjoy scene after scene.  If you rate a movie by the number of lines you can remember from it, this is one of the all time greats.  Much has been said of the soundtrack.  I am NOT a fan of gospel and 'old timey' music, but it just works so well here.  The theme that holds the film together is 'everyone is searching for answers' and, guess what, you usually don't find them.    My advice is to get acquainted with the characters and enjoy each scene as it comes along.  You can get many hours of enjoyment out of this movie. 9 out of 10",Null,0,1,28 May 2004
