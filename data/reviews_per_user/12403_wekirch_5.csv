First Man," Welldone bipic
","All the main events of the Gemini and Apollo programs are (or should be) well know. We know how the story unfolded. What we don't know is how it was ived by the people who made it happen. This movie shows us that.
Armstrong was apparently one of those close-mouthed types unable to show grief or other 'weak' emotions. But it's OK to show elation at winning, in his case by succeeding at difficult and very dangerous tasks. Armstrong's daughter died of a brain tumour. Anyone who's lost a child can identify with his grief, and anyone who's lost someone close knows that grief strikes repeatedly and without warning. The movie is based on a bio by James Hansen. I don't know how true to life Hansen' book is, but the movie convinced me. It's an odd thing, that although the moon program happened in the 1960s, the NASA world was firmly stuck in the 1950s.
So the movie's a good psycho-sociological study of NASA and the men who had the right stuff. It's also a hymn to work. The core of the story is the work of getting to the moon, and the personal and community sacrifices that this task entailed. I recall watching the landing on a large TV screen in the dorm in which I was staying while taking a summer course. But I didn't recall much of that while watching this movie. It was all about Armstrong, the NASA team, the moon shot, and the families. The music was occasionally intrusive, and some scenes teetered on the edge of sentimentality. The launches were impressively noisy and jittery: the astronauts are flying on top of a slowly exploding bomb. A movie worth watching.",8,2,5,13 November 2018
A Star Is Born," Great Music, but not enough to rescue the movie from mediocrity
","This is the third remake. I've seen the other two, and they are much better than this one. Lady Gaga (Ally) is a great performer, her rendition of La vie en rose is worth the price of admission. There were other great moments and scenes (I liked the 'I just wanted another look at you' moments), but overall the movie doesn't hang together. Should it show character through the work of being in show business (and it is work, hard work, with its constant demand to be up for the audience, to present to them the fantasy they've paid for and insist on seeing). Or should it show the work through the character's viewpoint (and so let us see what kind of character needs to be in the business of displaying a persona in order to feel validated as a person).
Jack (Bradley Cooper) kills himself so that Ally will be free of the effects of his drink and downers. A tragedy? A noble sacrifice? Or a typically sentimental Hollywood gesture? Ally may have some self-esteem issues, but underneath it all she's a steely-souled striver for fame. Jack thrives on stage, but has deep doubts about the value of his music. We get glimpses of what's underneath the surface, but it's not enough.
Cooper (who co-wrote the script) tries his best to show us the pain, he's given to long silent closeups of Jack's face as he tries to understand himself. But he shies away from the dark side. We get glimpses of what drives these people: Is show business the only way they have of facing the central questions of existence? In the end, Ally and Jack end up as cardboard cutouts, pop-psychology figures instead of fully rounded characters. A pity, since the story is about character. Show business is merely the means of displaying the flawed glory of being human.
I found the movie boring in places, pretentiously portentous in others, with a handful of great moments. The music ranges from pretty good to awesome. The acting is generally good, and Lady Gaga is excellent. Sam Elliot is as always a treat to watch. The script overuses the F-bomb, it's become a mere schtick. The photography is very good, never calling attention to itself, generating ambience and character, and carrying the story smoothly from one scene to the next.
Go see the movie, if only to get some idea of what makes a movie popular despite itself.",5,7,12,24 October 2018
Yesterday," Betles Nostlagia and more
","A sweet movie about love, 'the poisoned chalice of fame and money', reality (in several senses) and honesty with self and others. And the Beatles' music.During a balckout (never fully explained, but who cares), Jack Malik (3rd rate struggling musician) is transported to an alternative timeline in which the Beatles never formed a band. He's the only one who knows their music, and he builds a career by presenting their songs as his own. The story ends happily, with a couple of nicely done reveals that (almost) explain what actually happened. Along the way, there are some pretty good covers of Beatles songs (none of them complete, unfortunately), some neat riffs on the evils of fame and fortune, and a love story holding the whole thing together.Acting: first rate, including the roles of the (inevitable) stereotypes. Cinematography: competent, with no pretensions. Story line: plausible. Writing: very good, its main strength being dialogue that doesn't aspire to Great Thoughts.Some reviewers think the movie falls over the edge into sentimentality, but I disagree. Go see this movie. If you know and love the Beatles music, it's a nice nostalgia trip. If you're too young to remember the Beatles, you'll realise what you missed. ****",9,0,2,30 July 2019
The Princess Bride," Meditation Fairty Tales
","Based on William Goldman's riff on fairy tales, this is a charming and witty tale about True Love. The boy disappears when he leaves to seek his fortune, and rumour has it he's dead. So the girl doesn't object when the Prince decides to take her for his bride. The complications involve a giant, a swordsman looking for the man who killed his father, treachery and betrayal, and stuff like that. Of course the boy survived, and rescues the Princess from the evil Prince. Cameo appearances by Bill Crystal, Peter Falk, etc add to the pleasure.
So you might think this is just another light-weight entertainment. If that's what you expect, that's what you will see. I saw and heard an excellent script, above average acting, unobtrusive photography and music, and a meditation on the meaning and value of fairy-tale romance. Because True Love does win the end, though we may too often realise that too late. ***",8,0,0,24 October 2018
Black Panther," An old story well told as a Sci-F- Fantasy.
","The story is the Lost Heir Who Comes to Claim His Kingdom, one of the most used plots in all genres. Here it's a well done fantasy-scifi, with better than average writing for the genre, and only mildly overdone fight scenes. For once, the CGI is justified by the story, which would be impossible to present convincingly without it. The movie uses all the tropes and clich√©s we've come to expect from the Marvel comic book universe, and takes them seriously but not solemnly. Striking visuals, beautiful design, pretty good acting, and generally unintrusive music help to make this an entertaining movie. ***",8,0,2,24 October 2018
