","DiCaprio has impressed me with his movie choices of late. I usually stay away from Leo's movies mainly because they've been poor (exceptions What's Eating Gilbert Grape & Basketball Diaries) but I cannot ignore the brilliance that is Martin Scorsese (Gangs of New York) and Steven Spielberg for this film.It's nothing more than pop corn fun, a film which I enjoyed throughout and that includes the performance of DiCaprio, he certainly fit the bill well! The support cast are great, Hanks is good as per usual and Walken is also good, but didn't really deserve his BAFTA, I say this because I feel other performances in male supported male were better and on the screen longer.Spielberg does the usual good job as you would expect.7/10",Null,0,1,5 May 2003

","...I did enjoy this film but looking back now I feel it was some what disappointing. ...the special effects are great but the major flaw in this film I think is the script, it didn't quite excite as much as it should have. ...The casting was correct in my view, they all did a good job with what they had. ...Luckily the sheer popularity on Comic Book films has helped this film get a follow up and what a follow up it was!6.5/10",Null,0,0,5 May 2003

","...God yes it's a great film but I've watched it a good few times now and I really can't help but feel it's amazingly over rated. ...I find too many scenes in this film too dreary and to be blunt boring to make this one of the finest films in the history of cinema. ...It's opening scenes are fantastic, the that set the pace for the rest of the trilogy never mind the Fellowships itself! ...I think it laid very good foundations for The Two Towers, which in my opinion was so much better!!! ...I have read the books (before the films were out may I add!), and I prefer the book on this occasion!8/10",Null,0,0,5 May 2003

","...This movie is far more superior than The Fellowship of the Ring. Probably as the book offered more action than the first!. ...In my opinion there was only one segment which I really didn't like and that was any scene involving Liv Tyler and Hugo Weaving... this has nothing to do with there acting ability but the scenes simply bored me! But never mind! Oh and Andy Serkis was good but DID NOT deserve an academy award and the stuff not in the book the film makers added were pointless! ... I love this film but I am not going to lie and say this film was flawless! ... Mortensen, Bloom & Davies are the best things about this movie. The trio certainly bring the characters to life on the screen... and I cannot put down in words how good the Helms Deep battle sequence was at the end!9/10RETURN OF THE KING will be better though!",Null,0,0,5 May 2003

","... I am not a comic book reader, I do not care which character is put into a film or not so I think that is advantage me! ... I liked X-Men but felt it was lacking in many areas... this blows X-Men totally out of the water! It's much better. The character stories are much better although they need to do something with Cyclops (mainly for the sake of James Mardsen's career!)... ... The popularity of this film and the way the movie ends suggests there MUST be a third installment... it will be most welcome to the masses!Well done Bryan Singer, you've left the HULK movie a lot to do!7.5/10 For This Type of Film!",Null,0,0,5 May 2003

",...There was so much hype of this film I didn't think I'd like it and say it wasn't THAT good but I can honestly say it was! It left with that feeling of numbness that only a great movie can leave you with! (If you follow!) ...Jake Gyllenhaal is probably the best indie/cult actor around at the moment and I am more than sure when he makes the full time change to main stream cinema he will be massive! Same comment applies for Maggie Gyllenhaal. ...The cast is solid along with the script and the feature length debut direction of Richard Kelly is probably/hopefully going to be up there with the great debuts. ...the best film of the 00's thus far9.9/10,Null,0,1,5 May 2003
