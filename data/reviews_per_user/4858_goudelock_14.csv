It," Not bad but ver overrated
","It, has become one of the most popular horror movies of all time and it was good but didn't reach the hype who create.Everyone loves remakes so the box office reach an amount over half billion.The creators of the film did good job and the screenplay was fine but it wasn't scary enough and some scenes wasn't needed.",6,0,2,2 August 2018
Hereditary," True horror...
","One of the most terrific horror movies of the decade.Hereditary it's not like the other movies of the genre with all the cliches, jumpscares, stupid characters etc. The psychological horror and the mysterious feeling of the film in combination with the great acting proves that the genre needs movies like this, because personally I am sick of the stupid franchises like Saw or Insidious. It's not perfect but in conclusion works well and the screenplay and some creepy scenes will stay in your mind for a long time after watching the Hereditary.",8,7,12,3 August 2018
Deadpool 2," Deadpool franchise at his best!
","Like the first movie the sequel of our favorite antiheroe was absolutely awesome.The film has all these ingredients that we loved at the first part and also better plot, more interesting characters and a lot of humor and satirical references.",8,2,7,1 August 2018
Ready Player One," One of the best sci-fi movies of the year.
","Steven Spielberg seems to be epic in every cinematic genre he wants. Ready player one has a lot of visual effects and CGI but the plot and the characters is very interesting. The world of the movie is full of virtual things action and a lot of cinematic and pop culture references, mainly of 80s and 90s so its very easy for someone to follow the film, even if he is thirty years old or more.",8,4,8,1 August 2018
Rocky II," Second part of franchise did well as the first
",Stallone continues the legend of Balboa enough good as the first and with a few things that work better than the 1976 movie.But the second part didn't change the plot a lot so we see some twists that looks familiar and the first movie had for sure more iconic scenes in it.But the Rocky II is for sure a very good film has some better technically tricks and the final fight is a bit better than the first movie.,7,0,0,12 August 2018
Lion," The most heart touching film of 2016
",It's very difficult for anyone to not cry during the movie. Lion has a very good and experienced cast (Nicole Kidman is impressive) direction of the movie is astonishing and technically is perfect too.The only problem is in screenplay.For exaple we know such a few things for the life of Saru in Australia and likewise in his relationship with Rooney Mara so we can't follow the story between these two but its only a part of the movie.The guy who represent the 5 year old Saru is the apocalypse of the film and the ending its very touching so in conclusion Lion is a very good cinema experience.,7,0,0,31 July 2018
Justice League," Good yes, epic no!
","Definitely when you have in the same film all these characters, the standards of this are very high.The Justice League didn't touch the epic zone but it was a good superhero movie. The action was fine and the dialogues between the superheroes was very catchy especially the Flash.For one more time DC choose to go to the safest road, maybe because of the fear of making something trash.In conclusion Justice League is a good superhero movie and that's all.",6,1,1,1 August 2018
Split," Creepy, weird, cute, mysterious...
","M.Night Shyamallan is back with a great story.
The movie is absolutely impressive with mysterious feeiling nice plot and the underrated James McAvoy in his career role. 
Even the film is in horror category, during the movie you will laugh with some of protagonists personalities but at the end the Shyamallan will remember you, that this is a thriller. The reveal at the end maybe will make the franchise epic to the future but I would like to see something else.Anyway Split is one of the most interesting movies of the year so if you don't have see it, just go.",7,0,0,1 August 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Marvel studio killing it!
","Another one film that touch the epic zone from Marvel. Infinity war has a superstar cast and for sure the producers has a very difficult job to do, because its not easy to fit all these characters in one movie. And the result its almost impressive.The film has also one of the most awesome villain, good action and humor. The ending was a bit ambiguous, but all the questions we have will get answer at the next avengers movie so, we are waiting!",8,0,3,1 August 2018
A Quiet Place," Atmospheric and interesting but...
","I like horror movies who don't base at jumpscares and cliches of the genre.And this was on this category, with good atmosphere interesting screenplay and experienced cast.But the plot was a little bit slow and repeatable.It wasn't scary enough so in conclusion I understand the vibe of the film but I didn't enjoy it a lot.",5,0,1,1 August 2018
Rocky," The origin story of one of the most iconic cinema-heroes
","The movie that make Stallone superstar.Rocky wasn't the perfect movie.If you want to find problems at the plot and the screenplay you will find for sure.But the whole movie and the legend of the Rocky works well, even with these problems because it was one hundred percent creation of Stallone and the acting and the energy of the Italian Stallion was very improvised.In conclusion as movie it was just a good boxing film but some iconic scenes, the brilliant soundtrack and the fact that Stallone did all the jobs, make the movie write cinematic history.",7,1,1,11 August 2018
Joker," What a movie...
","Joker actually is a mix of different genres and elements who create something unique.
You can see the Taxi Driver or King of Comedy influences but Todd Phillips Movie has more things to say ... and Joaquin's Phoenix performance helps him to do that 100 %.
I think it's the best character development I've see in a movie and the screenplay it's artistic written. Even if doesn't follow the comic mythology at all and it's very realistic and less comic book movie, Joker has a lot of elements of Batman Mythology and gives some hint to DC fans. Dark, brutal, funny and sad at the same time ... Joker is one of the best movies of the recent years.",10,4,7,24 October 2019
Black Panther," Another one awesome origin story by MCU.
","The origin story of the prince of Wakanda absolutely reach the hype of the franchise.Very good combination of the modern and traditional, good plot, nice action and awesome villains(Michael B.Jordan was impressive and Andy Serkis was so cool).It has a lot of CGI effects, but the film screenplay and the plot was so goodwritten, so it was a very good start for the Black panther and his introduce in MCU was absolutely successful.",8,0,1,2 August 2018
The Greatest Showman," A magic film with some cliches.
","The greatest showman has a lot of good songs in it its very rythmical and for sure a good cinematic experience, with an incredible cast and the Hugh Jackman at his best.But also have have some problems in his screenplay.For example we learn such a few things for some characters, so we can't follow their feelings and have also some cliches of the genre.Even with these problems the film works well and the rythm of the movie is very good so you will enjoy the film for sure.",7,1,4,1 August 2018
