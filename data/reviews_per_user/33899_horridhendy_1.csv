Vertigo," I'm astounded that it lived up to its hype, but it fully did.
","I am currently trying to work my way through all of Hitchcock's films. I am currently up to having seen 19 of them. Vertigo was the 19th. I'm not sure why it took me so long to get round to seeing one of the most lauded Hitchcock films but I think it was because it was so hyped and people said that it was edgy and artistic that I thought it was pretentious bullshit and didn't really fancy it. I went into the film thinking it was going to be good but that it was over-hyped and there was almost no way that it could live up to my expectations. I was mistaken. This film is a masterpiece and I absolutely loved it. Now, I'm not going to wax lyrical about the camera techniques or anything pretentious like that because that's just not what matters to me in a film. I rate films based on how captivating or enjoyable they are. I would give this one 10/10 on both. I have noticed that the reviews that 'hate' this film complain about people who like it being pretentious and deluded but I noticed that they cannot offer a reason why the film itself is not good. They just criticise the fans of this film. That's where I reckon they are trying to be edge-lords and rebel against the acclaim this movie has received. I'm a firm believer in not judging a film by its fans. Perhaps the fans of this film are pretentious but that doesn't take away from this exceptional film itself. Some people who like with pretentiously wax lyrical about cinematic techniques and others will talk about the amazing plot, the dialogue, the tension and the fantastic performances. I'm the latter. I see a great film and I rate it as such.",10,5,5,9 November 2017
