Gremlins," Anytime something goes wrong I blame Gremlins
","As a child of the 80's I am obviously going to not hate on Gremlins. First off back in the 80's when I watched this it frightened me they scared me but as an adult now watching I can now appreciate the comedy. They don't make them like this anymore. All those people who tear it to pieces it's just a crazy fun film to just enjoy and read into every detail. If I ever have kids be sure I'll be happy to show them the films I loved as a kid. My 6 year old niece has so far sat through Goonies, Labyrinth and Princess Bride and she loved them all",10,0,1,27 July 2019
Requiem for a Dream," Awesome film and teaches you a good lesson
",Darren Aronofsky bravo for starters!! Of all the films I've watched of his this has to be the most depressing but downright phenomenal direction of a piece of art. Not only are the cast amazing the sheer brilliance of storytelling is pure class. Everyone has an addiction to something and this just hits that home it doesn't necessarily mean it's completely as bad as others. People deal with it differently. The music for me is what makes this a powerhouse - The Kronos Quartet drives the emotional impact of this film with each season that it descends on. Leaves a heavy feeling but one that will make you think twice about certain decisions you make. An absolute must watch as far as I'm concerned - One of my favourite directors despite not done many films,10,0,0,14 July 2019
Us," Outstanding
","I don't really write many reviews on films but I've just finished watching this at the cinema and I've got to say what an incredible film.
Jordan Peele's Us is one of the best things I've seen in a long time. It was clever, it was spellbounding and I was riveted from beginning to end.
Usually with films I can always figure things out pretty easily and it's very hard to get me surprised - but this got me surprised and I should have seen the clues all the way through the film but it so cleverly done that I missed every single one.
I'd definitely recommend this film it gets a massive 10/10 for me. I'm not going to say anything else as there is no need. Just go to watch it",10,1,8,6 April 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Endgame finally delivers
","Can I just say firstly I am a huge fan of superheroes in general I'm not a DC hater or a Marvel hater I live and breathe superheroes. Now as a massive Superman fan (no-one will budge me) I will always be biased that being said this movie was amazing.
Was it as WOW as Infinity War? No! But what it gave us was what I tried to explain to others and that is the message I thought it delivers - Goodbyes and Closure.
It was funny emotional and there were some moments where you couldn't help but think hell yeah!!! And I also got to say Captain America for once didn't come across as too straight laced as in previous films. The bit that choked me up was Spider-Man and Iron Man seeing each other again. Really emotional. Ever since I've watched this all I want to do is watch Infinity War.
Loved all the references and nods to previous films made it more final.
Go and see it - I am so glad I stayed away from spoilers and trailers",10,2,7,4 May 2019
The Little Mermaid," Absolute Classic
","Just reading some reviews on here for this and to be perfectly honest in this day and age it's so easy to get offended by things. To put it from a child's point of view they're not going to watch this and think oh hang a minute I'm going to do exactly what Ariel is going to do blah blah.And of course not they are children.I was 9 years old when this came out and it instantly became my favourite Disney film because of .....................the music!!
That's right the music is what stuck with me. It wasn't the message I was interested in after watching it was the singing and songs.
Plus my favourite animals have always been Dolphins/Whales, so therefore I loved this film straightaway.
As for the film itself as a 40 year old woman I still do not see why people are still getting offended it's just an animated film. I still love this film now as much as I did 31 years ago. It's a fun colourful film to enjoy any day of the year and if I do ever have children I'd definitely would show this them. My 6 year old niece loves it as much as I do",10,1,1,9 April 2020
1917," Not a fan of War Films but this was Amazing
","Not a big fan of films set around this era and war so going into this I had no expectations.
But afterwards I could not fault this film at all. The direction of this was stunning and the continuous shot was incredible you felt like you were with the main character the whole way.
I'd give this a clear 10/10 a must see.",10,8,12,8 February 2020
Straight Outta Compton," Straight Outta Compton - Great film
",I mean going into watch this film and never listened to NWA in my life was a pretty big deal as at the time when they were around I was into NKOTB. Never really got the whole gangster rap scene but after watching this film I completely done a 180 and now love their music also want to point out I'm an eclectic fan of music now. I'll say this about this film though it was an absolutely brilliant film. Loved every minute of it and to be perfectly honest I love long films over short ones. I feel the longer the film the more effort goes into the finished product.The casting was spot on to the point I turned to my friend saying whoever played Ice Cube in this film they nailed only to find out who he was - only Ice Cube's son.I've watched this a few times now and I still can't get enough of it. 10/10,10,0,0,19 January 2020
