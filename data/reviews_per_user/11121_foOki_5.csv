Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I just can't hold it in anymore... It totally sucked!
","Hmmm, I was going to reserve my opinion of this movie but after reading all of the other reviews no longer can I bite my tongue. Sooo many reasons why this movie fails so I'll list them :-
a) The stereotypical ethnic aliens (Jamaicans, Asians etc) b) The extremely wooden acting from the lead characters. Mainly Jake Lloyd (Sorry kid but even you at your tender age has ta know that you were pretty bad. Not the kids fault though, more George thinking that his own 'genius' would create a magical reality allowing even non-actors to perform... me thinks he is starting to believe his own hype) c) Boring, dull and unimaginative direction from mr Lucas. d) Bad Lighting e) Highly convoluted and tedious script that included.. f) Action pieces that were strung together in the hope that they could hold an audience for an hour or two and hide the fact that the script went no where g) A large amount of 'suspension of disbelief'All in all a very empty movie, and no this isn't because it wasn't as good as the original trilogy. Its because George (And maybe Rick has something to do with this... actually probably a lot, it doesn't help that your producer is a 'Yes man') has forgotten what hes doing. He tried to create a dark world with bright vibrant (And garish) colours... even a good director would find this hard to pull off. I guess a good comparison, more so than the other episodes, would be 'The Mummy Returns'. Ultimately a silly movie with similar set pieces but one that was a lot more enjoyable because it didn't take itself too seriously. And no George, trying to inject slapstick humour through the likes of Jar-Jar and one-dimensional characters doesn't count. On a good note, Darth Maul was a worthy inclusion... shame that he was a last minute one though, and therefore had to cark it. Oh well. I guess like everyone else I'm disappointed but I'll still relieve my myself of $10 and see 'Attack of the Clones' (Good name eh?) when it comes out. Oh well, George has sucked us all in. Just hope that instead of spending all that money on marketing he's made a respectable movie instead.",Null,0,1,10 December 2001
Training Day," Watchable
","When this movie first came out I absolutely hated it but having just watched it again I don't think its 'that' bad. It's not a very deep movie and glosses over a lot of its issues and themes to the point that I missed them originally. Maybe I was expecting too much from this 'dark and gritty' police drama..It looks to be a simple story of morales. Nothing to do with law. Just about egos and mainly noting that a criminal is still a criminal with or without a badge. Ethan's character's turmoil seems to be more that he keeps hoping that Denzel's character will eventually show him something through his unorthodox teaching 'methods'. Instead he simply learns what not to do and that he doesn't believe in Denzel.That's all. The ac tings OK, and the direction competent. So doesn't deserve rave reviews, but probably doesn't deserve bad ones either.",7,1,2,11 May 2006
The Matrix Revolutions," A Satisfying Ending
","Its funny for the contradictions in all 3 movies. Too much explaining (I think one reviewer said it best 'like a silent movie with the quecards to inform the viewers what was happening') and yet so many questions left unresolved at the end... Well actually, I prefer having a heap of questions at the end where I have to think about the movie rather than being spoon fed the plot and meanings. So in essence i enjoyed this one far more than the second installment. However it did seem like a cross between 'Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within' (A scene in Matrix Revolutions was a complete copy of a scene in FF.. I guess the fact that Squaresoft was involved in the 'Animatrix' would explain that...) 'Independence Day' and finally 'Fist of the North Star' (Manga version not live action..). It just goes on to prove that the Matrix Trilogy really is an homage to Asian films. From manga such as 'Ghost in the Shell' and 'Wicked City' to John Woo and Tsui Hark flicks.Anyhow, it all made a lot more sense to someone who comes from a background of asian movies for the essence of the plot.A satisfying ending to the trilogy that mainly relies on visuals and hidden meannings.",Null,0,0,6 November 2003
Transformers," An OK movie..
","I think I must've been watching a different movie to the one everyone else has reviewed here... Sure, it doesn't have to be the same storyline as the original, but did it have to be so overly simplified? How could a kid's cartoon (and comic book series) actually have more depth than a movie (I know its Michael Bay, but still..)?? The whole point of the series was the character development of the Transformers (hence the name) with the human characters secondary. In this movie, the Transformers were secondary and not even introduced until half way through as actual characters. It had every cliché the writers thought they could put in there. You know, nerd boy has cool rebellious girl fall for him while saving the world.. actually, the movie seemed to place more emphasis on this plot device than the actual invasion. There have been many cliché movies, but at least they don't feel as corny. Which leads me to the human characters (in this case, the main characters). None of them were interesting and all felt very one dimensional. There were a lot of human characters (more than robots) and all seemed trivial. While the whole point of 'robots in disguise' or 'more than meets the eye' is that the Transformers are fighting their war whilst trying not to be noticed.. not attacking anyone they can, and having wars in the middle of the city ala Godzilla. A point of major contention on the internet before the release of this movie seemed to be the designs of the Transformers. I decided to reserve my judgement until I saw the movie.. Unlike the story, the character designs in this movie were so overly complicated. Sure, the 80's designs can be updated, but not completely changed to the point of being unrecognisable and indistinguishable between each other. The original characters were easy to pick apart (simple and effective colour schemes and face designs) without having to hear their voices. Instead, all I saw was an ugly mash of grey wires and metal blending on the screen most of the time. The vehicles may have looked good, but not the robots. Actually, most of the faces reminded me of the robot from 'Short Circuit'.. They definitely didn't feel Japanese designed and again made the Transformers feel secondary.And finally, the product placement got pretty annoying. Its bad enough to see the same brands over and over again, but even worse to hear constant references to products.So, I guess what I'm trying to say is that I didn't find this to be a great movie, or even a good summer blockbuster. Its an OK movie (that has an OK action sequence at the end) but little or no character development of the Transformers, boring human characters, boring designs and little in common with the original series aside from the names. Stick to the cartoon, or watch Die Hard if you want action..",5,11,24,1 July 2007
There's Something About Mary," --a breath of fresh air---
","come on guys, cameron diaz ain't THAT pretty, and the gross out points arn't THAT gross but this movie IS goddam funny. Go out and watch it and just laugh yourself stupid. One thing though, you can't compare this to dumb & dumber due to the fact that in that movie the main characters were MEANT to be stupid and if you went to see the movie hoping otherwise then obviously you missed the point. Personally i felt 'tsam' reminded me of happy gilmore. anyhow go watch it, if you don't like it then theres no big loss.",9,1,1,5 September 1998
