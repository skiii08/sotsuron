Requiem for a Dream," Great Movie.
","I wasn't sure what to expect when I sat down to watch this film. No one I knew had seen the film yet, in fact, few people at all even knew about it. After seeing what a great movie it really is, I'm disappointed that not as many people have experienced it. And for me, it was an experience. Not in a very long time have I been so engrossed in every scene that took place in a movie. It deals so closely with the pain and sickness of the characters that every thing that happens to them seems to in some way effect the viewer.By no means is this a light film. Aronofsky's direction is masterful. There is a mixture of disturbing imagery, and the scenes themselves, filmed in a fast, jumpy manner give the illusion of raciness that those characters must be partaking in. It's a movie about addiction in its rawest form, and this movie does not pull any punches with the imagery and story.It's not the most original concept. Movies about drugs and drug addiction have been around for ages, but never before has a movie been so well done and honest on the subject. The acting is incredible. Ellen Burstyn as the mother gives a frightful performance. It is an incredible thing when an actor gets so involved within his or her role that while watching it, you feel for that character and no longer believe it's just an actor doing their part. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connely deliver fine performances. Surprisingly enough, Marlon Wayans shows he can act (I admit I was worried when I was told that he was in this film, I was sure he would undermine the movie.) Everything about this movie is good. Right up until the end, I enjoyed every moment of it. In its genre of movies, it is unquestionably my favorite.~Christopher",10,0,0,31 July 2001
Memento," Incredible.
","Few movies, in the last year, have really captured my imagination. With the constant stream of typical, boring movies with nothing but eye candy and a plot so loose and full of holes it's degrading to believe that any real thought went into them (and not just a series of cliches thrown together to make a movie), that I was so ecstatic when Memento was released.This has been by far my favorite film of recent years. Everything is skillfully arranged. The narration adds a comedic and sometimes sad resonance to the film. The acting was great. Guy Pierce, formally in L.A. Confidential, was so believable and secure in his role as Leonard, that it was hard to imagine he was not experiencing his problematic inability to produce new memories. The movie is filmed in reverse. And of course, that means, the beginning is really the ending. But Memento is so wonderfully written, that even this does not really give away what is going to happen. And it is not this alone that makes Memento such a wonderful movie. The ride through Leonard's life in the past few days is so fun and full of interesting events, that there was never a moment that dragged or left the viewer with any sense that things weren't going somewhere. It is such an entertaining film that though it is a movie full of surprises, knowing them and watching it again does not hinder its ability to absolutely capture its viewer's attention.Memento is a great film that should be viewed by everyone. It has writing and direction that is well beyond that of any other movie out right now. When this is released on video, I'll be one of the first people to buy it.",10,0,1,2 August 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Am I the only one who saw this movie? (SPOILERS BELOW)
","When I went to see this movie, no one was in the theater. I was literally the only one there. After feeling depressed upon realizing I had no friends or life, I started becoming consumed with the film. Was I the only one confused by that so-called Quidditch match? I mean, what kind of ridiculous game is that anyway. If I had been playing that game, I would have simply cast some sort of death spell on the other team, and then laughed a lot, while Alan Rickman and I talked about Die Hard (a far superior film in every way.) People keep comparing this movie to Lord of the Rings. I don't understand why. They're not even in the same genre. This was some sort of pseudo tragedy with Arthurian overtones. Wasn't it obvious that Weasley was a Young King Arthur struggling with the knowledge and power of Excalibur? Secondly, Lord of the Rings is an epic comedy like Woody Allen's Take the Money and Run. Who doesn't laugh when Arwen does her pagan dance of Voodoo love?
Another thing, people keep saying that scenes from Harry Potter are similar to those of the Phantom Menace. The Phantom Menace was horrible. Who cares if they borrowed scenes? If anything, they should have taken the scenes and not put them back, so as the Phantom Menace might be a better film. Would anyone really care if the stupid pod race wasn't in the movie? I surely wouldn't. For a satire on the contemporary human ethos of the Oedipus/Electra complex, Phantom Menace hardly lived up to expectations.
Back to Harry Potter - I heard that in other countries, the original title is Philosopher's Stone; this is because stupid Americans become frightened by words like Philosopher. I agree. Americans are stupid. The school system in the states is pathetic, and it's teaching crazy people to compare this movie to other movies that cannot even begin to relate.
The visuals weren't that impressive. Did anyone else notice that Harry Potter was being carried around by giant ropes? It was pretty obvious to me. And when that troll was in the school, was I the only one who noticed it was not a real troll? I'd think with the budget they must have had for this film, they could have hired a real troll. Also, the three headed dog was actually a two headed dog with a computer generated third head. It was clear that the so-called 'third head' was poorly drawn by inferior computer designers. The best part of this movie would likely be the lesson I was taught at the end, which was that if a Wizard really likes you, you'll likely be able to cheat and steal points away from the evil looking blonde kid. It's a lesson we all have to learn in life, I'm happy to have learned it now.Overall, I rate this movie a 10 out of 10, because it was bombastically beautiful.",Null,0,0,13 December 2001
