Minority Report," Intense
","First off, this is a must-see, big-screen Event.  Go see it.It confirms Steven Spielberg as one of the greatest directors ever. Tom Cruise is actually capable of quite a range of screen-depiction of character.  His fame, unfortunately, precedes him and will forever cast him negatively.Anyway, this film is longer than you might expect and the trailers won't ruin it at all.  The special effects are amazing and mostly the futurism is believable.Most of all, what will get you is that just when you think the film is about to end (and not at a bad point at that) it shoots off in another direction and surprises you.I have to say that Agatha's actress is extremely powerful at just the right moment and will reach right into you, with a simple word.My one and only (minor) gripe, is that where the film should have ended it doesn't, and plays to the heart more than it should (as with A.I. - Steven, please stop doing that).Go see it.",9,0,0,28 July 2002
Grease," Gravely shallow.
","Individually the components of this movie have quality.  The same cannot be said about the movie because it is hypocrytical and appears to want to remove good intentions from anyone under the age of 60 when it comes to love.  I blame this film for the problem of unhappy, unsupported, single parent families.",1,13,36,6 October 2002
Resident Evil," Faced paced action, a bit of gore, beautiful woman.
","Ok, there is nothing original about this film, but, as with a number of films being made recently, it can somtimes look original because of the recent love with computer graphics and eye-pleasing cleanliness of of recent movies.Milla looks great and proves herself once again, even if there is little clothing or script available sometimes.  Some might say that she was a little too undressed for the film's rating, (but I reserve opinion as I like to think I'm well balanced enough not to be affected).The action is very cool; violence equally so - although some taken (come on guys, admit it) straight from the excellent, minor cult movie 'Cube'.  My only grudge on the sfx and action is that we could have seen the hologram a bit more.  My only grudge on the storyline is that it was asking me to stretch my disbelief almost that bit too far, which even I can do quite frequently.All in all, I now realise they may have been saving a bit of the budget for the sequel - which I hope lives up to it's future hype.  I must congratulate the script writers, sfx guys and actors for a job well done, considering game-to-movie conversions have not faired so well (see the excellent 'Wing Commander' - yes, I stand by that).",8,0,0,15 July 2002
Meet Joe Black," Emotional, human and perfectly acted.
","I was not intending to see this film at all as the reviews I saw/received were not glowing and it looked extremely boring, as well as long.I happened to see all but the first hour tonight (yes, it is long) and I must see the beginning.  Perhaps I will see all of it when I am next with my closest loverd-one.  It's how this film is.Although the ending left me feeling as though we needed to see more, perhaps we didn't.  We know what happened - although the emotion may have needed turning around.It is a very emotional film and although there are parts I would have liked to have seen included it is such that you feel absolutely connected with the characters - even without ever having known their kind of life.Every actor/ess is perfect and the cast could not have been better. Anthony Hopkins is, as always, genius.  Even the supporting members were perfect.See it.",8,1,1,2 January 2002
Signs," Scary. Best movie of this year.
","Go and see this film right now.I have to write about this film now - it's 3:15am and I've just finished watching it.This movie will make you tense and scared.  You will think you are being prepared for what is to come, then realise (too late) that your'e not. Don't even try to kid yourself.We came out of the film and no-one spoke, we were shaking.Don't let anyone tell you what happens in the film, just go see it right now.",10,0,2,13 September 2002
The Truman Show," Perfect.
","Confirming Jim Carrey as an Actor, not just a comedian, and placing the most media-questioning punch of all-time in it's face, this film delivers thought provoking emotion and comedy all in one.The thought which should stay with you in the end is: The media probably will do this one day - isn't that wrong?  Can it be stopped?  And perhaps, is it me?",10,0,1,28 July 2002
The Matrix," Pure Genius
","This movie confirms Keanu Reeves as utterly cool.  Same goes for Laurence Fishbourne.Special effects: amazing. Story: Amazing. Acting: Amazing (Carrie-Anne Moss pulls off the best tacky-line said with least tackiness trick EVER!)If your'e not into Sci-Fi or Sfx, don't bother.Carrie-Anne Moss was also in Memento, another stunner.Come on, everyone has seen this by now - just go buy the DVD and watch it.",10,0,1,28 July 2002
