50 First Dates," Sandler and Barrymore win hearts again.
","'50 First Dates' is a movie far better than I expected.  It probably would have made an excellent date movie on first released, and certainly worth a trip to the new release section of your video store.The basic premise (assuming you haven't read a thousand other post)is Adam Sandler, a Hawaiian ladies' man who tends to aquatic animals for his job and repairs his boat in his spare time, finds himself falling for Drew Barrymore, a young lady with short-term memory loss. Perhaps most surprising is the movies unwillingness to compromise on the handicap, and working toward a solution that is realistic but sweet and romantic and occasionally heart breaking. It is comparable, easily, to 'The Wedding Singer', and at many points shows the actors maturity, though Adam still seems to have difficulty with more extreme sincere sentiment.
I would rate the movie higher, but individual performance are sometimes weak.  The total, however, is greater than the sum of its parts, and most people should stay moderately entertained through the movie.  The only thing keeping me from rating it an eight is that it doesn't seem to have strong purchase power, though once turned on you're not likely to turn it off.

The Girl Next Door," The Hughes Torch
","For those who enjoyed John Hughes teenage angst movies such as the Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles and the raunchy trilogy of American Pie, this will be right down your alley. The leads Emile Hirsch, Elisha Cuthbert, Timothy Olyphant, Chris Marquette and Paul Dano carry themselves very strongly, almost to the disadvantage of the rest of the cast who become vital structurally, but otherwise completely unnoticeable. There is an occasional violent tone to this movie that clashes bizarrely with its otherwise comedic nature and the scenes are very disturbing. Additionally dream sequences are blended with real-time sequences, for occasionally comedic, sometimes freakish effect. Timothy Olyphant almost steals the show as a sociopathic porn producer who you never quite know if you want to cheer on or wish he were dead.Hirsh and Cuthbert mix quite well, blending the finding and losing of innocence with a pleasant sincerity. Chris Marquette comes across as a young John Laroquette type character from 'Night Court', and is entertaining. Borderline on visibility, but filling in when he does, is Paul Dano. Visually and scriptwise the movie is a lot of fun throughout, and tries to avoid wading in its own sincerity too much. The 'unrated' version hardly seems to need to be unrated, and I'm not precisely sure what separates this movie from a modest R rating. A 7.5 on a 100 point scale and a flat 8 on a 10 point.Damion Crowley",8,0,0,13 September 2004
Full Metal Jacket," Damion reviews Full Metal Jacket
","'Full Metal Jacket' follows a single Marine-nicknamed Joker(Mathew Modine)-through boot camp and a portion of his time in Vietnam. It is loosely based on the story 'Short Timers' by Gustav Hasford. It is directed by Stanley Kubrick, known for long, eccentric movies that weave surreal and super real characteristics blended together, creating nightmarish, hollow and disconcerting movies.The boot camp portion of this film is what most people remember. The drill instructor is played by R. Lee Emery, and it is one of the most terrifying, moving, funny and convincing performances in movie history. Virtually a non-stop rant from his first appearances to his last he electrifies the performances around him and puts the viewer in boot camp with the rest of the recruits. Vincent D'Onofrio does well as Private Pyle, overacting in only one scene-though it is a critical scene. Matthew Modine's performance is almost tertiary to Emery and D'Onofrio's performance. We do get see him develop a little, the positive characteristics that will make him strong in Vietnam.The second portion blends sixties rock n' roll and Vietnamese urban warfare to tremendous effect. The war effort is crumbling and Reporter Sgt Joker is sent to the front to support infantry and get stories for the 'Stars and Stripes'. There, Joker confronts the full effects of war on himself, friends and strangers. One is hard pressed to remember at points that it is just a movie, so comfortable and real are the actors in their surroundings. The Door Gunner ('ain't war hell?'), Animal Mother, 8-ball and Cowboy are consumed by their roles. It is definitely not a movie for those easily offended by language. As an anti-war movie, it seems to have exactly the opposite effect. Nonetheless, it is a powerful performance, with the entire cast making it greater than the sum of its parts. It is the finest Kubrick movie that I've seen(out of eight). I recommend it for anyone over the age of sixteen who enjoys action or war movies. I rate this movie at nine stars out of ten. It truly deserves to be an American classic.",9,4,6,25 April 2004
X-Men: The Last Stand," Damion Crowley's Reviews from The Darkness: X-men 3
","X-men 3: The Last Stand is a fantastic spectacle, an utterly worthy sequel to the first two movies. It will awe you with imagery, amuse you with character interaction, and tickle your intellectual and philosophical bones without over-burdening them.For the new arrivals, the X-men movies are a series of movies featuring a group of super-powered beings (called 'mutants') who have to deal with the prejudice of humans against them. Additionaly there are a group of super-villains who are intent on becoming the master race and eliminating the humans.The principal thread of this movie is that a 'cure' has been discovered for mutants. The primary antagonist, Magneto, is ready to crush those who would create the cure and establish political and social dominance over the humans. As a parallel to this story, Jean Grey who died in the previous movie is seemingly reincarnated as the Phoenix, a telepath/telekinetic with overwhelming power. The Phoenix becomes entangled in the struggle between the good mutants, the bad mutants and the humans.This movie knows its special effects and how to execute them. There is barely a dubious moment in the entire movie. You get a true sense of the awe inspiring power that these characters have.On the more humanistic level, you get to see how many react to being a mutant and to the news that they may be able to fix themselves. Of note are Anna Paquin and Ben Foster (who was sorely under utilized) on opposite ends of the spectrum. There is much more, but seeing it for yourself is the best way to experience this emotional impact.The script and plot are, for the comic vet, old ground; but, by movie standards this is quite fresh. Plus the dynamic presentation of a story that has been presented statically for so long is quite the rush. Most of the actors, from the principles to the tertiary, did excellent work. So good, in fact, I would feel shallow pointing out my one real disappointing character in the movie. Notable debuts (at least in this franchise) are Ben Foster, Kelsey Grammerand Dania Ramirez.Overall, an excellent movie, that I recommend rushing out and seeing as soon as possible",8,1,3,26 May 2006
Schindler's List," A terrifying rumble through the soul
","After seeing this movie, I regret not seeing it on the silver screen, as this would have done this terrifying, magnificent, powerful film even more justice. As it is, on the TV it is a mesmerizing and gripping story. I have long ago decided not to have a favorite movie. Too many films offer their own unique pleasures, and singling one out as a favorite is simply to difficult a task.That being said, 'Schindler's List' is definitely one of my favorites. I am surprised at the criticism I read, but I guess that is what makes us the human race.The only real flaw in the movie that I saw was near the end, where Schindler is berating himself for not saving more lives. I hope the scene occurred in real life, otherwise it just seems contrived and unnecessary. If it really happened, then the worst you can say is the Neeson simply could not convey the impact of the scene. Or perhaps Schildler really sounded like that at the time. Either way, it was a minor scratch on an other-wise magnificent film. I won't comment on the films realism because my knowledge of history is weak and I expect Hollywood to take liberties. As long as they kept the spirit of the story alive, that is all that matters to me. To any one who hasn't seen this movie, I definitely say: see it! It is not light viewing and parents taking their younger children--even their older children, really--should be in attendance, and remember not to dismiss this movie and the scenes therein as mere Hollywood magic. While I don't pick favorites, I do believe this movie will rate higher than any other movie I have ever rated, with a 9.8 out of 10. If given a choice between a 9 or a 10, I will give it a flat 10. Thank you.",10,9,19,26 March 2001
