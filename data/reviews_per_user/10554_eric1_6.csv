Blade Runner 2049," Sadly hilarious
","The whole promotion campaign for this movie is misleading, the posters are colorful, the trailer is fast-paced, while the actual movie is dark and slow. It's OK to make a dark and dull Sci-Fi, I like Moon and Villeneuve's Arrival. And Villeneuve did delivered some interesting elements to Blade Runner, especially on virtual women. However he failed on story telling, even lost focus along the way, ran out of time (in a 2 and half hour movie), then jumped to a quick conclusion. The major problem with Blandrunner 2049 is Harrison Ford, this is the third time he picked up a role from his prime age, the third time he got a long lost child... And all three franchises are Sci-Fi at some level. It's ridiculous to see the same face in the same situation saying the same dialogue for the third time, and this situation and dialogues are TV soap clich√©s to begin with. I know that no one in Hollywood give a %$%$ to character or screenplay anymore, but I did hope a little more imagination from a legendary Sci-Fi brand.",4,16,34,10 October 2017
Glory," the story, the mood and the music score are so great
","I watched this movie yesterday, it's been several months since last time I was excited by a movie. It's not a perfect war movie, the soldiers are too peaceful to a must-die mission, their bravery makes them seems a little unhuman to me. But the story, the mood and the music score are so great, there are several scenes that almost made me cry. Honestly, I don't feel Washington is so good, there is no bad boy look on his face, he talked like a big hero even if in the scene which he is blaming the poor black gentleman.But Mogan Freeman is really good, especially in the Pay Day scene.",5,5,13,5 November 2000
Dunkirk," Would you call Saving Private Ryan 'Normany'?
","I found that he title is misleading, this movie has no interest in presenting the Dunkirk retreat, rather than focusing on three groups. In other words, if you are not interested in World War II, you probably won't understand what's going on the whole time. It's like to call Saving Private Ryan 'Normany'; or Deer Hunter 'Vietnam War'.",4,4,16,22 July 2017
Hero," A tribute to Chinese Dictators
","As a Chinese, I can not believe the movie got a rate this high in U.S. And I don't think you guys get it. It's not fantasy, the Emperor in it is the first guy to conquer the whole land of China, to do that, his army left a lot of bloodshed. A couple of times,they buried hundreds of thousands people alive.That's why there are so many killers aiming him, they want revenge. But in the movie, this chinese Hitler became the good guy, his side is the good, the killers are all wrong. So according to me and a lot of chinese moviegoers, Hero is a tribute to the chinese dictators behind the Tian-An-Men massacre.Its main idea is that it's everyone's duty to sacrifice himself for the emperor a.k.a the dictator. If you guys love the combat, give it 6 or 7, but don't give it a 10.",1,18,39,30 August 2004
Coco," The unique Pixar feel, hope this is not the last
","This is the kind of movie that only Pixar could make, way above all the 3D talking animals from other brand, up to the level of Inside Out, Up and Wall-E. Spectacularly brilliant. I went to the cinema with my kids, and my 10 year old daughter has been literally kept on edge of her chair when the story reaching its end. However there is one little thing that bothers me, before the feature film, there is a short intro by the filmmakers, they showed a shot of the dead world, and explained that this short has 20 millions light source on 10 millions buildings (or the other way around). I know Pixar/Disney is the vanguard of CG technologies, good for you. But I don't care, that's not what make me drove to the cinema in a snowy night, that's not what kept my kid on the edge of her chair. It's not the 10 million lights shot made Coco great, story and story telling is the unique magic, a great movie is not about the tech or the money, it must also have a soul.",6,2,14,27 November 2017
Valkyrie," What a stupid hero...
","The problem with this movie is that, Tom Cruise tried too hard to make Stauffenberg a Hollywood hero.All credits of the July 20th plot went to this guy. According to the movie, he is the one who get the reserve army idea, he is the one who persuaded all the other members, and he even became the commander of the whole thing at the end...First of all,I don't believe a colonel can maneuver a bunch of generals in 40s' Germany.Secondly,if Stauffenberg was the key man of the plot, then I must say it's the stupidest plot ever: what if something went wrong and Stauffenberg dead at the Wolf Lair? The Queen never go to some pacific island to hunt evil scientist, she let Bond do it.I'm not a WWII specialist, if all these things really happened in real history, then I will give Mr. Hitler some credits for kicking all these generals into reserve army. These guys answers to a colonel and unable to set up a reasonable assassin plan, how could them be useful on the Eastern front?",1,22,54,31 December 2008
