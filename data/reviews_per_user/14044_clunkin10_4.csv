Skyfall," 50 Years, but Still never gets old.
","I am not a huge James Bond person, in fact I've only seen a few Bond movies. However, I must say they are a work of art. The characters and storyline must have required a lot of thought. Huge movie legacies like this or The Godfather never gets old or played out. And as I said before, Skyfall is a work of art. Unfortunaly, I cannot say that about many movies. Honestly, very few films deserve the honor (in my opinion) of being call 'art'. The thing that made Skyfall good was not the action or the suspense, although that was good as well. It was the simple fact that it keep the 50 year old name of James Bond alive. You didn't see all those unnecessary changes and mix ups, like some directors like to do. That I think made this move a good one to watch.",7,3,6,17 March 2013
Iron Man 3," Good, but not better than the first
","When they made the first Iron Man, i was like 'Man! They have to make more.' Then they made Iron Man 2. It wasn't a bad movie it was just not up to (or close to) the first movie's standards. Well my friends, the third was not as good as Iron Man (1), but it was up there. I feel like Iron Man 3 is at least the second best in the trilogy. As far as making the film goes,(not gonna spoil anything) look out for all the foreshadowing. You will also be hit with a little comedy. Kind of like all the Iron Man movies. There isn't much I can say about Iron Man 3. I did like the action sense of the movie. I did contain a lot of action and it did live up to it's title of being an action movie. Also like the first one. Throughout all the Iron Man films, Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark was always my favorite actor. I cannot say the same for 3. Gwendolyn Paltron's Pepper Pots was mine in this one. She acted very well. Overall, Iron Man 3 was a good movie that is most definitely a movie worth watching. However, it still can't beat the first.",7,3,6,13 May 2013
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," I Liked it.
","I am a very fair judge of movies. I don't just say I like it or hate it out of bias. But I must say, Ghost Protocal was a pretty good movie. It is enjoyable for anyone over the age of 13. It had a little bit of everything in it. That is what I like to see in a movie. If it is an action movie, I want to see more that just action. Can I see a little comedy, and drama in it as well? This is kind of how Ghost Protocal went. Not going to give anything away, but it had some great scenes in the movie. It's not really a 'Must Watch' movie, but if you ever find yourself bored, give a try. Whoever did the cast was good. The actors did a fantastic job and actually fit the part. I can't always say that for some movies. Well done.",7,1,3,21 February 2013
Glory Road," Not Good....Great!!!
","Glory Road has to be one of the best movies I've seen in my life. I would easily rank in my top 20, perhaps like #17. I like the movie because it was simple but still had you on the edge of your seat the whole time. You would always wonder 'whats gonna happen' or 'Oh my, whats next'. It was time appropriate. It took place in Southern 1960's and that is exactly how they played it. Almost every time you thought, something that is suppose to happen, will happen, it turned out be just the opposite. It wasn't like those typical sports dark horse movies at all. If you know what I mean. It stands out from those movies because it filled with irony. Glory Road is filled with ironic parts. Some you will get right away. And some you might have to think about for awhile. Derek Luke did a great job playing Bobby Joe Hill. For a second, I actually thought he was a basketball player. Josh Lucas also did a fantastic job playing Don Haskins. He had character and played his role with emotion. Hard to find actors like that anymore. Overall, Glory Road turned out to be a suspenseful, emotional, unpredictable movie that I really enjoyed and wouldn't mind seeing again.",7,0,0,18 April 2013
