The Rock," Above average for its genre
","Nicholas Cage is not my idea of a great actor, and I am not a fan of this type of movie -- heck, I don't even know what it would be called, action thriller? That said, I found this movie entertaining. Perhaps that is because I don't watch this type of movie, so I am not going to see it as a collection of clich√©s, as one commentator remarked.The key, of course, was Sean Connery. There is wonderful irony in learning he is one of the great British secret agents, yet has been a prisoner for decades. It is almost like learning Superman is still alive, but squirreled away in Guantanamo.More precisely, Connery's character is reminiscent of Patrick McGoohan's The Prisoner. If only the series could be revived with Connery in the lead! At any rate, I am a great fan of Connery, as an actor. Cage, he needs to be in the right role, and this fits him fine. The two together have an interesting chemistry.So it is watchable, even if you don't watch this type of movie.",7,2,3,19 August 2007
The Patriot," This IS NOT an American movie!!!
","Foreign readers: Don't blame America for this movie! It's got a German director and an Australian star - Gibson. And Gibson has a track record of anti-British movies.Most Americans know this movie is not accurate. It's sad that some foreigners might form opinions based on this vile, hate-mongering manure.To watch this movie is to learn what it feels like to be covered head to toe with sweet smelling vomit.The British soldiers are portrayed as 18th century versions of Nazi Storm Troopers, and Jason Isaacs playing a fictional Col. William Tavington as an unbridled sadist who kills, burns and pillages just for the fun of it.The high point of the movie, so to speak, is when Tavington locks the townspeople in a church -- after they tell him what he wants, ratting out a fellow patriot -- and burns the entire town, women, children, men, boys, to death. I know something about the history of the Revolution, and had never heard of this. Apparently, it is based on a Nazi war crime, not anything done by the British. The movie is directed by a German, Roland Emmerich, which perhaps tells us something.The movie seems to follow the Mel Gibson formula of ultra good guys vs ultra bad guys (usually the British) with lots of graphic blood and guts violence. It would be technically interesting to count how many times we must witness a musket ball hitting a body and blood spurting out, for someone with a strong stomach. Is there a point here? The acting in the movie, overall, is nothing special, but Gibson's performance is by far the worst. Witnessing this travesty by Gibson kept bringing to mind the parodies of silent picture acting from 'Singing in the Rain.' People all around him are dying, yet the best Gibson can summon up in the emotions department is empty, over-blown gesturing. This might have qualified as acting in the 1920s, but not today.Mel Gibson could act, once. He did it in The Year of Living Dangerously. But now apparently it is too much work for him, despite the $25 million they paid him for this performance. I don't mind a good old fashioned movie with heroes and villains, and I'm sure there were heroes and villains on both sides of the Revolution. But this movie doesn't find them. All it finds are caricatures of heroes and villains.",2,1,3,6 August 2007
Titanic," Downright amazingly bad
","(THIS *&%$#! COMMENT MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS.)(Or it may not.At least it may spoil your appetite for this film.)I have to give James Cameron credit for a sort of devious ingenuity: He created a movie so repulsively bad that a reasonably sophisticated viewer would find it unbearable to sit through. Hence, so many glowing reviews.I watched it, once. But it keeps popping up on TV. And even for free it is not worth watching. Five minutes these days is my absolute limit. Each time I stumble across it, this movie just seems to get worse and worse. The acting is so bad I'm surprised Cameron didn't just make this into a sort of Disney cartoon. Disney's Buena Vista does this sort of simplistic bubble gum movie better, such as White Fang; Ethan Hawke as Jack Conroy was more credible than DiCaprio as Dawson. And the aerial computer graphics look way too much like cartoon animation.As to historical accuracy, give me a break!!! I can't say this is any worse than the other nonsense to come out of Hollywood, though. Frankly, anyone who takes any so-called non-fiction or historical movies as more than 1 percent accurate is a fool.Hey, I am willing to suspend a certain amount of disbelief for a good movie, but this one demands way too much. They pull a drawing that has been sitting on the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean for 80 years that is in excellent condition and hold it up as proof of why it was worth hundreds of millions of dollars to find the Titanic. And what is this precious work of art? A Rembrandt? A DaVinci? A Van Gogh, at least? No, it is an amateurish pornographic sketch. Excuse me? Maybe some 21st century girl would pose naked at the drop of a hat, but a proper girl in the 1910s?Hey, if you believe this nonsense, then the rest of the movie will seem comparatively plausible, and I can see how you might find this movie 'historically accurate.' I don't mind if you enjoyed this movie; that's what movies are for. Tastes vary. Some people prefer emotional manipulation that is more subtle. I would hope you Titanic fans would explore cinema a little more, and not insist that this is the greatest movie ever made, perfect, etc. What's with all these superlatives? Does Cameron have a claque?Look, before you say Titanic is the best movie EVER, (which implies you have seen every movie every made) at least go see Gone With the Wind. I dare you. Then see if you can even mention Titanic in the same breath.And I think potential viewers should be forewarned that not everybody is going to like this movie. That's what reviews are for. Spoiler ahead: OK, the ship was named 'Titanic' and it sank. That much they got right. Well, sort of: it was the RMS Titanic, not the SS Titanic.If you want to learn the true story, try going to the BBC page 'Titanic: Sinking the Myths,' by Paul Louden-Brown.",3,12,23,22 June 2007
