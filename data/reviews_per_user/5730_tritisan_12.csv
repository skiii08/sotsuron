Love and Death," Before Woody got too serious
","My friends and I watch this one together every now and then, and every time, we are in hysterics. It's like the Rocky Horror of intellectual comedy. We know every wacky line, repeating it along with the cast.I appreciate all the film theory in-jokes, but I mostly love the pure, classic slap-stick comedy. I'd say this is my fave Allen film.",9,0,0,10 March 2000
Memento," my $.02
","I've only seen this film once, and I think I need to see it a couple more times to really sort things out. But here's my initial impressions.I'm a sucker for any film which explores memory and how it makes us what we are. (Blade Runner, Groundhog Day and The Usual Suspects come to mind. What, you wonder why I mentioned Groundhog Day? It's a truly great film, and in a sense, it's like Memento inverted. Bill Murray is the only who can remember he's stuck in a time loop; everyone else forgets.) Memento does a particularly good job, since it forces you to remember events in a new way: backwards. It also makes you wonder about who has control of the narrative. Just because we are shown events doesn't mean they actually happened.
For instance (SPOILER ALERT), Teddy tries to convince Lenny that his wife needed insulin injections. We see a flashback of Lenny pressing a syringe into his wife's thigh. But then we see another quick flashback of the same scene, only Lenny is pinching her thigh this time. Lenny is thrown off, calling into question the stability of his long term memory. And we the viewers question which story is 'true'.Heady stuff indeed. But that's one of the problems I have with Memento. It's too much like a game using people as pawns. The characters were hard to empathize with, partly because they were so hard to figure out, and partly because there was something inhuman about them. One exception is Sammy's wife, the only person I could truly feel for in the film (but did she even exist?) For a while, I could feel sorry for Lenny's loss of his wife and his memory, but his thuggish behavior and calculated plotting became increasingly psychopathic. I, for one, cannot sympathize with murderers.So, I highly recommend Memento, but it certainly does not belong on the IMDB Top 10.",9,0,1,1 December 2001
Underworld," yawn
","I really wanted to like this flick, but I found myself constantly coming up with ways to make it so much better. To boot...1) Get a better leading man. While Kate and Michael and Bill and Scott provided decent performances, the complete lack of talent on the part of Shane really brought the rest of the cast down.2) Get a better film editor. The action sequences were remarkably uninvolving and dull. The exposition bits felt clumsy (in ways not necessarily due to acting or script).3) Get a better stunt choreographer, like Woo-ping. See above statements. Plus, in the final battle sequence between Viktor and Michael, it was SO obvious that their fists were no where near contacting each others' bodies. The gunfight bits were also pretty uninteresting. This might also be the director's fault, so they should get a better director, while they're at it.4) Get a better script writer. I don't have super-high expectations for this sort of film, but it still could've been far more interesting and involving. For instance, I think if they would have paid more attention to the way these Underworld creatures secretly inhabit our world, by say, starting the movie from Michael's point of view instead of Selene's. Other than Michael, his intern friend and some cannon fodder in the subway, humans played almost no role.5) Give the vampires and werewolves more interesting powers. Especially the vampires. They were too wimpy. The only interesting thing the vamps could do was jump from high places, or stick to the ceiling (which only happened once). They were atrociously bad shots and couldn't even hear well (like when Selene is surprised by a speeding subway car. Even I could frickin hear a subway car coming at me!) Perhaps I'm expecting more of an Anne Rice style vampire.6) More gore. I'm not a gore hound, per se. It's just that for this subject matter, it all seemed way too PG-13.7) Better soundtrack. The sound design was decent, but the early '90s-style industrial metal (which I used to be a big fan of) simply didn't work. They need something creepier, more suggestive, like Einsturzende Neubauten or Aphex Twin.Unfortunately, looking at Underworld: Evolution credits here on the wonderful IMDb, it would seem it's too late to take any of my advice, as most of the cast and crew is exactly the same.",6,1,3,8 August 2005
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Not dark enough, not adult enough
","It really could have been so much richer. I have a feeling that del Toro, an amazing director in his own right, was creatively limited by working with Hollywood execs. (Hollywood has a solid record of importing great foreign directors and turning their work into pulp.) There was a sense of internal struggle watching this flick; it lacked coherency and solidity. That said, I did enjoy the phantasmagorical visuals and the Miyazaki-like themes of deep nature impinging on modern life. And the opening sequence of Hellboy-as-all-American boy being mentored by his father figure was deliciously subversive.Not having read the original graphic novels, I only know Hellboy's character through Perlman's wonderful mug. He manages to play the brutish-yet-sensitive types with a subtle spark of intelligence. I also admired Blair's performance.",7,1,1,25 June 2009
The Matrix Revolutions," Enter the Mythic
","I don't think most people are appreciating this series of films for what they really are: True epics. The Wachowski Bros are using the modern 'action' genre as a vehicle to explore the timeless questions that religions and philosophies seek to answer. Is there a God (or gods)? Is there such a thing as free will (or is it all predetermined)? What is karma? Can love conquer all?Of course, there's a danger of taking all this seriously heady stuff too seriously. That's why the Wachowski's wisely gave us millions of deadly squid-bots getting blasted by an army of mech-warriors while the fate of the universe gets determined by a smashing atomic kung fu fight. Otherwise, you get something more like The Seventh Seal.Filmicly (love that word!), Revolutions references so many movies and genres it's hard to keep track of. The obvious ones are: Aliens, Star Wars Trilology (the originals, folks), Work War II sagas of the '50s, Blade Runner, City of Lost Children, Terminator, kung fu movies, Hong Kong gangster flicks, Roman sagas of the '50s, etc, etc...Not only that, but we get treated to a pantheon of Classic characters. Charon, the boat man of the river Styx (the passing to the realm of the dead), makes a great appearance as The Train Man (played convincingly by the whirly-bird pilot from the Road Warrior). The Architect is the Father (Reason) and the Oracle is any version of the Dark Mother (Chaos). Did you know that one of the older meanings of matrix is 'mother'?So these Matrix films are, in my opinion, Great Art. They can be read and interpreted and appreciated on many levels. Interestingly, many of the comments here and by professional critics (there's a special level of Hell for film critics) seem to entirely miss the cool stuff. They focus on the unconvincing and preposterous love stories and absurd football rah-rah war hero bullsh*t. And yes, I believe these elements are weak, but they really are beside the point. They are just tired old stories.Notice instead that Neo has transcended the world of conflict (duality) and has entered the realm of pure light (non-duality). From this higher realm, it does not matter if you are a machine or a human. All that matters is that you are conscious and aware. Everything else is just a silly game. That's why Agent Smith 'wins' and 'loses' at the same time. In the assimilation of Neo and all he represents, he accidentally gets himself enlightened! All games have an end. You may choose either mutual annihilation, or you can simply say, 'Stop this nonsense, let's play something more fun!' So what's it gonna be?",9,0,0,6 November 2003
Hero," All of the above
","Judging by the wide range of views expressed in the ever enlightening IMDB boards, I'd say Hero is destined to become a 'classic'. Real art invites multiple interpretations.Yes, this may be Chinese propaganda. Yes, it may be Kurosawa-lite. Yes, it's incredibly beautiful and provocative. Yes, it can be boring and indulgent. Yes, it's a post-modern assessment of what it really means to be a hero. (Jet Li told a reporter recently, 'I wish the world didn't need heros.')I quite enjoyed it, for the most part. Actually very touching near the end, if not a tad confusing. If nothing else, you can sit back and not think too hard and just let the imagery and sound wash over you.",9,0,0,2 September 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," bloody brilliant
","For all the critical complaints of all style, no substance, I say, 'GET A CLUE'. Of course this about style. The medium is the message. You can't take this stuff seriously. Except that it's all seriously funny. I mean, we're talking parallel dimensions here. Samurai swords on commercial airliners. Only two bullets fired in the entire film. No cops! Obviously fake miniatures of Tokyo. Leading the film off with a Klingon quote.Critics take note: This is pure, unabashed, post-modern fantasy. I guess you could even call it porn. Whatever.9 of 10.",9,0,0,17 October 2003
A Bug's Life," A perfect film, really
","After having watched this wonderful movie on DVD many, many times (thanks tomy two-year-old's insistence), I can safely say it is flawless. The characters, the voicings, the story, the animation, the sound, the editing: every element of A Bug's Life is brilliant.It has laughs for all ages, no silly musical numbers, not too sentimental, not too violent. Just right. 10 out of 10.I wonder who will get sick of it first, me or my daughter.",10,0,1,8 December 2002
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," not satisfying
","As someone who has never read the books, but enjoyed the other filmed Potters, I was disappointed with #4.The biggest problem was the pacing: I found myself loosing interest pretty soon after it started. Not that I ever really got bored. Just that I had a hard time caring. Something about the acting (more likely the directing) didn't 'sell' me. Plus, the story arc was weird and hard to make sense out of. No matter how good a book is or how faithful you want the movie to be to it, a film must stand on its own terms and be true to its own world. Harry Potter 4 fails on both counts.Also, some of the music was unbearably cheesy ('prom scene' and closing credits).",7,1,2,20 November 2005
Ice Age," Quite good, my daughter gives it two thumbs up
","We rented the DVD recently, at a friend's recommendation. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Not as good as A Bug's Life (animation not as good, story a tad weak, editing not as crisp, more limited characters), but better than most animated flicks these days. What I liked most was the physical humor. It reminded me of those wonderful old Warner Bros cartoons. I should mention that my two-year-old laughed harder at this movie than any we've watched with her.8 out of 10.",Null,0,0,8 December 2002
Amélie," Beyond escapism into magic
","Another commenter, from Turkey, said, 'A human being lives as long as they dream and imagine. The day I stop imagining and dreaming will be the day I will be dead.' I think this beautifully sums up what truly great cinema aspires to be.If one goes into a movie theater only to be entertained for a couple hours and then to forget the experience, that's escapism. But if you are so moved by a film that it changes your life (like seeing Star Wars for the first time), then we're talking about a whole other level. Viewing Amelie is one of these rare experiences. Through the dreams of another, we are connected through a shared sense of lonliness in this (seemingly) uncaring world. But someone with a heart of gold (quite literally in one scene) shows us how to love by giving, without any need of validation or compensation.In one of the most touching sequences, Amelie sees a old blind man trying to cross a busy street. She takes his arm and leads him across. But she doesn't stop there, she holds on and walks him briskly past the shops, describing what's in the windows and what people are wearing. She gives the man a sense of sight for a few minutes. When she drops him off in front of the Metro stop, the man experiences Rapture. She has given him a priceless gift.This film operates at so many levels, I could write for hours, but I will stick within posting guidelines and simply state:Amelie is a perfect film.",10,1,3,1 December 2001
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," great film, flawed casting
","I read and loved the book years before the movie was made. Of course, I painted myself a pretty detailed picture of it in my head, what the characters looked like, the location and atmosphere, etc.When I heard Tom Cruise had been cast as Lestat, I felt like starting a riot on Hollywood Blvd. Blaspheme! And Brad Pitt? Yuck.But I couldn't help myself and had to see the movie all the same. And I was pleasantly surprised. The 'look' of the film was very close to what I'd pictured, with deep shadows and saturated colors.Even more surprisingly, I enjoyed Tom's performance. He successfully embodied Louis' hedonistic, egomaniacal abandon. Brad, on the other hand, produced exactly what I'd feared: a shallow, pouty performance. I had pictured someone much taller, and more elegant. Brad is cute and all, but sophisticated he's not.And then there was Antonio as Armand. Antonio is a pretty good actor, but the book described Armand as much younger, more innocent-looking, like a choirboy. But Kirsten as Claudia was perfect, and everyone else fit the bill nicely.8 out of 10.",8,0,2,2 December 1999
