The Blair Witch Project," The Most Overhyped Film of the Year
",This has to be the most overhyped film of the year...and that is saying a lot in the year of 'Star Wars:Episode One.' I'm glad a lot of kids seem to get a scare out of his drawn out around the campfire tale. I just got tired of the lousy camera work...even the 'filmed' stuff that was supposed to be part of the final documentary was crappy...and the improvised F**k this F**k that dialogue. A nice little 'student film' but wait for the 99 cent rental. After seeing it I felt like still wanted to see a movie.,2,0,2,21 August 1999
