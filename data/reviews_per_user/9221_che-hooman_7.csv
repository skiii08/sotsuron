Fasten your seat belt and get ready for the most intense rides as Al Pacino takes the roll of Tony Montana and owns it, his performance will blow your mind. Scareface will keep you on the edge of your seat.So sit back and watch Tony Mantana make his way trying to become drug Lord!!",9,0,2,13 March 2013
No Country for Old Men," My review
","In the Coen brothers' beautifully terse and achingly intense No Country For Old Men, we learn very early on that a drug deal has gone wrong on the eerily flat plains of southern Texas, leaving no surivors and only a briefcase full of money. Through the stolid eyes of Josh Brolin, who delivers an effortless performance as the overconfindent Llewelyn Moss, we see the aftermath of this carnage and we also see a desperate man with a mountain of debt snatch something he does not fully comprehend, as much as he likes to pretend he does. Tightly raut scenes of almost morbid silence such as this one fascinate almost as much as Javier Bardem's nightmare-inducing turn as psychopathic hit-man Anton Chigurgh, who is sent to retrieve the drug money by any means necessary, but all he needs is his trusty cattlegun friend-o. Any lesser movie would seemingly desolve into cat and mouse territory here with shoot outs and standoffs galore, but nothing is ever quite what it seems in this bleak but mesmerizing country, as Tommy Lee Jones shows up as a soon to be retired sheriff, and commands the screen by pumping the drama with morality and reality, not just lead.",8,2,2,14 March 2013
The Pianist," Touches so many emotions
","I want to say the pianist, Spillman, forces commiseration and pathos throughout the whole movie. I don't think you can really finish this movie and not feel sorry for him. The last scenes with his family are so poignant, with just a few lines of dialogue, the director touched on the essence of saying good bye. His love of music, and not being able to play personally touches the audience. As music is his life and passion, not exercising that talent only drives sorrow to the extreme-degree. The look throughout all the scenes of the film express the dread of his character so clearly: the look of holding back tears and not giving up. This only adds to his dignity as someone trying to survive and bring the humanity out of others.",9,1,1,13 March 2013
Schindler's List," a great story, and well directed!
","Okay, what can I say about this movie that hasn't been said or isn't that obvious. This movie is the most heart-wrenching movie that I have ever experienced. I have always been a fan of Steven Spielberg. I would just about watch anything that he would direct. This is by far his biggest accomplishment...EVER. Everything is perfectly acted and perfectly shot. It is wonderfully scripted by Steven Zaillian, who in my opinion should keep continuing to write screenplays because he did a beautiful job. God a master piece that will let your tears go out, when i saw this film in my home i was surprised that a director had created such a motion picture not the best film ever but it gets to your heart, a film that is long but its worth watching the whole thing, i don't think that is the greatest film ever but yes is good, other films that show a great story is The Pianist which is one of my all time favorite films, you should watch that one its pretty good to.",9,15,23,13 March 2013
Pulp Fiction," must see
","Pulp Fiction is probably one of the best movies ever made. The story layout is a interesting tale of how several stories can cross each other. Tarantino is probably one of the most talented directors out there, with his trademark camera shots and interesting ways to look at stuff. Sure, some people may get sleepy when Uma Thurman and John Travolta's characters talk, but you have to admit it is still good nether the less. Oh yeah, the best part is when John Travolta blows off a person's head The stories all connect and put an interesting twist to the film. All the actors really do a great job and several really memorable lines. As the film ends you will think to yourself, 'what a great experience'. I would like to see a 'Pulp Fiction 2'.",9,0,2,14 March 2013
The Shawshank Redemption," best
","I can't say enough about this film its simply the King of Kings when it comes to movies.Other movies might have something better, but put all the contents of a great movie together and this one hast is all Narration, acting, humour, direction, story, suspense, soundtrack...the full package.Its a powerful movie and I don't know how you can keep your emotions in check with such a intense story. Its a tragedy this didn't win an Oscar for best picture over Forrest Gump...for me there isn't many movies that possess the overall strength of this movie, hence why its still #1 in on IMDb and top 5 on many other reputable internet sites.",8,0,0,13 March 2013
The Godfather," One word, 'Perfect'!
","This is considered my favorite movie and to many others, no wonder why The Godfather was considered to be the Perfect movie, cause of Frances Ford Coppola's Unquestionable direction and the film's story of the family business and a human story as well! This is the holy grail of gangster films that is to me and everyone, a real unforgettable classic! Excellent movie, quality acting, screenplay,depth of characters, locations! Producer,director,music,all excellent. It will be a long time before this movie is exceeded in all these facets. Current films do not come close in matching Francis Ford Cappola's masterpiece. Mr.Cappola's refusal make another film only reflects great decision making in the industry. Many film makers in the future should emulate the overall quality shown in 'The Godfather'.",9,1,1,14 March 2013
