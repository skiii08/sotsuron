Skyfall," Finale of the Beginning of THE BOND
","Bond is back. The First Stunt Sequence is Outstanding comparing to the final 'SKYFALL' sequences. STORY: Nothing. At last after so much technical build up, they ended it like a normal revenge movie. In this edition, Daniel Craig is much adapted to the Bond Character & style than the other two movies. Good looking Bond girls; Gorgeous Locations; Classic Cars; Stunning Stunts; Witty One Liners - Everything were there which we usually expect from Bond Movies (which we miss from other two movies). I think the Director had the confusion where to use the Bond Theme and as usual he wasted it by misplacing. Negatives: The movie is slow paced and the overall movie is lengthy.
