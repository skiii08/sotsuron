Mission: Impossible III," MII MUCH better
","MIII has got a few great, heart-pounding action sequences, funny moments and intriguing high-tech gadgets to please any action-spy genre fan.Were they going for the same emotional intensity as in MII? I couldn't understand some of the characters (Cruise and Seymor-Hoffman) teary-eyes in several scenes - it didn't make sense for one character to get te at all! At one point, I was rolling my eyes over it.I was able to figure out who the villain was way before the person was exposed because of the choice of actors. One actor is portrayed as the villain, but I sensed it wasn't right because this actor is known (lately) for playing people with high integrity. The actual villain is an actor who is known for his lack of integrity in real life, so I immediately suspected him.Jonathan-Rhys Meyers is still hot looking, but his character was too much like the cabbage/side salad that is put on my take-out pad thai -I know it's there, but I never eat it.I still LOVE MII (except Thandie) and I think it's A LOT more visually interesting (great mix of slow/standard/fast motion) than this latest installment.",7,0,2,7 May 2006
