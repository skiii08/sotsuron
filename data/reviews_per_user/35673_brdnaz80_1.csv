United 93," United 93.
","This movie was spellbinding, and should be required viewing for all Americans. While we all remember, my fear is that we will allow the real horror of that day to fade.The crew and passengers on Flight 93 were an amazing group of people with courage that defies description. I was particularly touched by the strength displayed by flight attendant, Sandy Brandshaw. As I watched the movie I was struck with the fact that nobody in the theater moved from the moment the film started until it ended. Popcorn and trips to the bathroom were forgotten.As I left the theater I remembered exactly how I felt on 9/11/01. I was so deeply touched that day that I was unable to work the following day. God bless those aboard Flight 93. They are truly heroes.",Null,2,4,5 May 2006
