The Avengers," The most Amazing superhero movie ever made!!!
","Marvel has accomplished gathering and teaming up some of the greatest superheroes on the big screen for the first time. Josh Whedon is proved to be one of the best directors for me since this awesome movie has no flaws at all. The acting from all the characters is great and the movie is being unwrapped flawlessly.This movie contains some of the most amazing action sequences in the history of cinema. I am really happy for being able to watch this piece of art,which I am sure will remain for ever in my memory.For all Marvel fans and non-fans this is an extremely recommended movie to watch.For this amazing movie my rating is 10/10!!",10,22,43,20 April 2012
