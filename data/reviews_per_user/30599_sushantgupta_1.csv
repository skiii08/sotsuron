Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat: A boring run
","Exaggeration of baseless allegations, false intentions and gross inconsistencies. The way some of the scenes are shot is just awful. An unreasonable and barbaric attack on Kazakhi culture and people. The sets used are absolutely raw and there seems a dire need of some artistic sense. The irresponsibility with which sexuality is dealt with is just pitiful. The character of Borat himself is dubious, spiteful, and of no correlation. What were the director and the producer thinking while making this so called movie? I only hope they had better creativity and sensible thinking. Nothing worthwhile to watch or enjoy. An extremely poor form of entertainment.",1,2,4,5 April 2008
