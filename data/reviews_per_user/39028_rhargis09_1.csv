It," Very scary!
","IT was what I was expecting and more! Yes, there's a lot of CGI but in 2019 that is the norm anymore. There was some scenes that terrified me, and I loved every second of it!!! I wasn't sure how they would be able to match the iconic Tim Curry as IT, but Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd did an awesome job portraying his own version.",9,0,1,16 December 2019
