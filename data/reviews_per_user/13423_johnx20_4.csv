Skyfall," Simply extraordinary!
","When going to watch this film I was a cautious as I had heard that Sam Mendes has made some changes to the bond franchise which, as a big bond fan, is worrying. To put it simply I was simply blown away by this film, even the opening was different and a nice refreshing change to the previous starts. The great cinematography in this film makes it feel even more magical as we see fights in this film which seem almost like a form of art.The characters in this film are, for the most part, intriguing and complex especially those of M and James Bond. The villain in this film is new and different to other villains as he isn't as conventional as others, but also, his motivation for doing what he does makes the film seem more personal and meaningful than other films. Another great part of the film is that we don't quite know what all these pieces of the puzzle add up to until the end as the film comes to a memorising end of great metaphors and a very emotional end. Performances in this film are superb as Judi Dench portrays a deeper character than any other bond and she becomes the main Bond girl in this film. Daniel Craig gives his best performance as bond showing Bond at his weakest but mainly at his best which he step up to very well. The special effects in this film are unlike anything else seen in other films in the action genre. The mood of the film is a comfortable one which can quickly have you on the edge of your seat.This Bond film simply leaves any other action film a lap behind, I've never quite experienced any action quite like this.",9,2,11,29 November 2012
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Just brilliant
","I must say when I first watched this film I Thought there would be a lot more action scenes in this e.g. Car chases, gun fights etc but even though there weren't any massive action scenes I absolutely loved this film, the plot is extremely clever, the cast and acting is brilliant especially Gary Oldman and Benadict Cumberbatch they play their characters extremely well. As I was watching this film I was alittle confused to why there were different stories through this film that kept coming up, but at the end of the film it all made sense. The directing of this film is brilliantly executed, I would recommend this film to anyone who loves spy thrillers and who isn't looking for over the top action scenes but a superb plot and a film that makes you wonder and think.",7,1,3,4 February 2012
The Grand Budapest Hotel," A cinematic marvel
","If the world of The Grand Budapest Hotel existed I would enter it immediately, the film that has been created is a visual and character triumph. There are very few films that have been created which convey the precise image that the director had intended, down to the last detail, but the Grand Budapest is one of them. The colour schemes that are used to contrast the mood and the emotion for each scene are impressive enough, but the highly orchestrated set design and props allows for a single shot of a character to reveal their entire personality. From the bright flamboyancy of Gustave H to the dark mysterious persona of Jopling, we see true characters being developed, ones we find ourselves involved in and rooting for. While some may only watch this film, I feel the only way to truly experience it is to analyse. For example, why does Moustafa keep the hotel? Is it the building itself, is it the nostalgia or is it the last remnants of the idea good will and kindness of man creates greatness, not money or greed only by watching can you find out and draw your own conclusion. The world is immersive, the characters are deep and full of personality. The story is truly an amazing achievement. This film is what cinema was made for, I cannot praise it enough.",10,2,5,18 May 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Totally unexpected
","I wouldn't usually watch films of this sort of genre, I'm not always a fan of the image that they create and the in your face advertising, which usually disappoint. With Mad Max, it lives up to the reputation. the whole world that is created in this film is marvellous, real aesthetic is built up before the torrent of violence occurs. while of course the film is never going to be heavily character based with complex layered story lines, for what it is, it is a widely enjoyable film. the costume and design is very absorbing in itself, with realistic props being created. I do feel the film needed a little more dialogue, the characters often became unrelatable or cared for due to the lack of development, if something bad happened to certain characters, often the feeling created was less than sympathetic. overall, however, it remains a strong film with good aesthetics created and enough fast paced drama to ensure the film progressed at a good rate.",8,4,12,18 May 2015
