Source Code," A TV Pilot with a Hollywood budget?
","So many many people have compared Source Code to numerous movies.. and that's just from the reviews I saw on page 1! so here's my comparisons/influences:Movies: Groundhog Day, Deja Vu, Jet Li's The OneTV series:Quantum Leap, Seven DaysQuantum Leap was immediately the biggest influence in my eyes as soon as Jake Gyllenhaal's character sees his reflection! (and then I read on IMDb that QL's Scott Bakula actually had a cameo in the movie!! - I didn't read the credits!)The way the movie ended gave me the impression that there's scope for either a sequel or even a 'Seven Days' style TV series.I was thoroughly impressed with the acting, though I wasn't necessarily a fan of the love story element that was clear in the trailer. It was a little schmaltzy for my liking.. but the thought of parallel universes.. IT works.. in a way.The action was fast flowing and so what if the train time window isn't EXACTLY the 8mins they refer too? You need to see different variations in those 8mins. if you want EXACT repetitive scenes watch Groundhog Day! I hope there IS a sequel... if at all possible.",9,0,2,7 March 2012
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Eurovision Perfection: Douze Points
","Due to unforeseen circumstances, Eurovision was cancelled and what I wasn't aware of, The Story of Fire Saga was due to be released the same week as the real contest. Will Farrell is a big fan of Eurovision, and it's clear to see here. There are some great Eurovision star cameos found in this little gem of a movie. It helps if you do love or know of Eurovision. The jokes and references were on point. The songs were really good, and I know I'll be listening to the album later. This could be an annual viewing essential for those Eurovision parties! Absolutely loved the soundtrack.",8,9,14,27 June 2020

Black Snake Moan," Credible Blues and Incredible acting
","I'd heard about this movie for years... usually attached to the fact that Ricci went a portion of the movie topless or scantily clad. But in the scheme of the movie...it wasn't about sex and nudity. it was about realising what you got, and what happens when you jeopardise what you got. It's also about The Blues too!Yeah, Jackson ain't the best singer... but damn, he sure can play! Numerous times my foot was tapping away.Ricci and Jackson were really involved into their characters (Ricci staying in 'character' by staying scantily clad on set much to Jackson's chagrin and Jackson learning to play the guitar) and it certainly showed on screen. Timberlake certainly showed promise as an actor as this was one of his early movie roles and was a credible supporting actor.By the end of the movie you learn that the one that can control your issues are you, yourself. People can help, but only you can make the changes!",9,3,7,31 March 2012
The Green Mile," Uplifting and thought provoking
",This film was beyond expectations. I only recently seen The Shawshank Redemption a few weeks ago and that was brilliant! Then I heard that The Green Mile was made by the same people. Having seen it I was on the edge of my seat! Fantastic casting and acting from Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan. This was certainly an Uplifting and thought provoking film and also tugged the heartstrings too.,10,1,2,22 September 2000
Da 5 Bloods," Some may get it some may not
","What starts as a trip back to Vietnam for a group of War Vets to find the remains of a fallen friend and some gold the group originally found in war, turns out to be a fight for their lives again. Some might find the film disjointed - but I found it incredibly powerful in parts. The film has been released at very politically aware time. The trailer to the film, may entice you to watch but the story won't be what you expect. Enjoy.",8,37,74,13 June 2020
