The Avengers," Great Movie
","The Avengers is one of the best action films that I have ever seen. The idea that some of the great Marvel superhero to fight together against evil, I seemed brilliant since I heard of it. Interesting effects, very well located, a perfect combination and as a bonus, very realistic. The action is great, all fighting united against the ultimate evil, Loki. Although I wanted to see someone else in the role of antagonist. Besides that we have some superb action film contains some scenes with some humor in it, which brings a +. The locations chosen for the film are absolutely wonderful, idea of movie is great, the whole movie is amazing. Overall, I think that it is a great film that I highly recommend.",10,1,4,30 March 2014
