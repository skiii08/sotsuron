Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Hmmmm. What can I say.....
","The plot is awesome, but I don't know about those special effects.  I mean, knowing what we know about it all being fake, how can you not percive everything as a bluscreen with computer images in front of it.  It really detracts from the movie I think, but then again.... That's just my opinion.",Null,0,1,21 May 1999
