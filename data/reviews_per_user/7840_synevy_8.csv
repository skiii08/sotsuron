The Avengers," It's all about Gamma radiation baby!
","The Avengers was a delight to watch. Almost two and a half hours of comic-like action with Nick Fury managing to assemble Earth's super humans and fight against Thor's little brother who found his way back from the void. Loki is angry and desperate for some attention. He almost got me to kneel! Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is arrogantly gorgeous and Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) is the retro patriotic avenger, while there's an intense love/hate relationship between them that really keeps you wondering 'what the hell is going on with these two?'. Since i've started like this, it doesn't look hard to pair them heroes up.Naturally, Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) come next. This combination brings up the special human skills of the characters. They are the martial arts, tactics and weapons specialists and keep more of a supporting role in the film, 'filling up -well enough- the parts where there's no cgi action'.I must say that Mark Ruffalo (Bruce Banner/HULK) was my favorite, because i could not imagine how 'these anger management issues' could ever be tamed. Bruce Banner's zen attitude made the whole Hulk transformation even more exciting and controversial. On the other hand, Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Such a verbal relief to begin with, cause he's just THOR the deity and, oh, isn't he a challenge for The Hulk! He's practically one of the few out-of-this-realm entities who can get slightly close to his powerful energy.Last, but not least, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Thor's misunderstood and troubled brother, who NEEDS to get his revenge by any means necessary with the help of his evil army. You'll admit it yourself that he does try hard without always counting the consequences. He'd be perfect for a psychiatric study! S.H.I.E.L.D's agents are rounding up the human coordination team, with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) being the head of this operation and the only character one's probably gotten used to see in the post-credit scenes of the 'Iron Man', 'Thor' and 'Captain America' films, as well as agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg). You'll also get the chance to see Cobie Smulders (Agent Maria Hill), also known as 'Robin' in How I Met Your Mother TV series, making her Hollywood outbreak.This film consists of a cluster of actors, all getting their respectable time to shine as heroes in Stan Lee's comic masterpiece.So, here's the thing. If you've never seen any of Marvel's movies, make sure you do before you move on to The Avengers. It'll be easier to understand each character, their background, motives and nemeses. Make sure to wait for the credits to end.If you have seen all/most of them (or have read the comics), there's no doubt you won't like this one. The action is overwhelming, there's no need to focus too much on performances and DON'T forget to wait for the credits to end.",9,2,6,6 May 2012
Midnight in Paris," Deeply surprised
","I was almost convinced that it would be just another Woody Allen's weird movie, but gladly i proved myself wrong. It's a beautiful and inspiring story about an engaged couple and their own -different- expectations that are being exposed during a trip to Paris, France. Gil (Owen Wilson) seems to be drawn by the beauty of this city and needs more time to enjoy the experience while trying to finish his novel. Inez (Rachel McAdams) doesn't share the same enthusiasm. Between their opposing viewpoints and quarrels Gil experiences a personal faerie tale, through epochs where art was flourishing.The location itself takes you back in time. Most of the scenes where shot at night where the Paris atmosphere is magical and nostalgic. It slowly takes you back to the Roaring Twenties, the Golden Age -and beyond- introducing you to some very interesting characters. In this film i found the supporting actors performances far more interesting than those of the protagonists. Very talented Marion Cottilard, Tom Hiddleston, Alison Pill and, of course the lovely Kathy Bates and Michael Sheen.Judging by the eras, you ought to expect a beautiful music compilation, from 1890s Jacques Offenbach to 1920s Ben Bernies orchestra and Nat Star. I'd give kudos to Mr. Allen for this one.",8,0,2,28 January 2012
21 Jump Street," Another great 2012 comedy
","21 Jump Street is really nice action comedy with a lot of influences by its producers, who also were starring in the film. This was Channing Tatum's first attempt in comedy and, like i've said before, it's really interesting to watch how the actor can adapt to any role. Jonah Hill on the other hand is one of the new great comedians of this new film wave. Sarcastic, smart, rebellious. They made both of the characters to learn something from each other. Successful chemistry.Besides the catchy title that might take you back in the time of the TV series, this film shares only the mission of a couple of young looking police officers that are assigned to an undercover drug research in a high school, as students. Watch carefully though.. You'll find out what i mean.It's a fun film with good music, fresh scenes and a rather young and talented cast. You have the right to remain silent and watch it.",7,2,3,12 May 2012
Warrior," Nice Story
","A former alcoholic boxer (Nick Nolte) faces his past in the eyes of his two sons, Tommy (Tom Hardy) and Brendan (Joel Edgerton). Things tend to get personal during a mixed martial arts tournament where both brothers participate.Nick Nolte gets into the skin of such characters, he's fantastic. Tom Hardy comes from the latest brilliant generation of British actors, very talented, great performance. The theatrical Australian, Joel Edgerton, shakes things up with his 'warrior' side.At first, i lost the rhythm of the film for a while. Close to the middle of it, it started clearing up to a really good finale, in my opinion. Yes, you might get that Rocky rush here, also. It is exciting. The music's great, suits pretty well. It was composed and produced by Mark Isham. The atmosphere was humid, cloudy and focused on the cage. The matches scenes seem to have been shot with TV MMA show cameras. They move pretty quick outside and inside the ring.Again, if you're into sport films, with the drama lurking in the background and some good actors, you may like it!",9,1,4,4 February 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Captivating mystery
","When it comes to mystery/ crime genres i'm more of a visual kind of type. I've never read the books, so i was completely unaware and untroubled by the fact that i'd just experiment with watching another movie without any expectations. And i think this is one kind of way to enjoy a film.For starters, the cast was fantastic! I was only remembering Daniel Craig's playing in this movie, never looked for any information before. And there's, Christopher Plummer and Stellan Skarsgard, Robin Wright and of course Rooney Mara (she was great). Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is a journalist who's been assigned to do a research on a missing woman. Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) is a hacker who assists him. It's a lovely mix of mind and science. It keeps you wondering about the crimes and the connections and the psychology. Like, everyone's a suspect.The scenery was beautiful, gloomy, overcast, creating an additional suspense especially with the foggy locations. Cold colors. You'll have to get cold to get comfortable (that means your emotions, too). Director David Fincher did a great work, and i see that he's bringing up '20,000 Leagues Under The Sea: Captain Nemo' in 2013. Also, 'The Girl Who Played With Fire' is the second book adaptation of the trilogy and it will officially start shooting back in Sweden at the end of the year.Overall, it's a very interesting mystery film with nice twists. I enjoyed it very much. All 158 minutes of it!",9,3,8,25 January 2012
Drive," Good. Not great.
","Drive is that kind of movie that you'll either like it a lot or not (cause if you were so - so about it, you should've stopped it when you started getting bored). The plot is interesting and harsh. It makes you want to see what happens next.The music is unbelievable and it runs all over the film. One thing i liked about it is that, even when i was paying attention to a conversation, the music would stick to the background. You can listen to a whole track! The photography is amazing. Warm and cold colors blend beautifully.The performances weren't extra-ordinary in this movie, in my opinion. Ryan Gosling is very talented and he's making a major break through these last few years but i didn't see something special. He also seems to already have a leading role in another film by the director of Drive, Nicolas Winding Refn, in Only God Forgives that's in pre-production. Nice supporting performances from Carey Mulligan (Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps) and Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad TV series, Contagion, The Lincoln Lawyer).Be prepared for some slow rolling movie rhythm. Don't get caught up by the title. There is some good driving in it -and i've always wanted to see a Chrysler 300 chasing and bumping on a Mustang GT 5.0- but that's just about it. Plenty of cars to see, though!",7,0,2,12 January 2012
Black Hawk Down," Going Down Hard
","Right as you read this, the Somali civil war is still going on. Since 1991. Twenty one years, with casualties reaching up to 500,000 deaths. There, the REAL hunger games are being played. The rest of the world's interference came up with nothing. Even humanitarian missions are being attacked.Black Hawk Down is based on a book written in 1999 by Mark Bowden that chronicles the United States Army Rangers, 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, 10th Mountain Division, Delta Force, Navy SEALs, and UN forces attempt to capture Somali warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid in Mogadishu and the intense battle that resulted between U.S. forces and local militia and citizens in 1993.Even though it's a war film, with a lot of continuous action, the cinematography is beautiful and points you to pay attention to the detail. There were a few fast scenes greatly covered and co-ordinated. The whole movie was accompanied with strong ethnic and instrumental music, songs from the 90s and earlier.What can i say about the cast! It had variety , and talent. With names such as Tom Sizemore, Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Eric Bana, Ewen Bremner, Jeremy Piven, Tom Hardy, Orlando Bloom, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau and the list goes on. A lot of them have made more than one appearance in various war films or TV series before.It's a good war film to watch with a lot of information on what's happened and happening in Somalia. And i'll finish this with a quote from the film: 'You shouldn't have come here. This is a civil war. This is our war, not yours.'",8,1,2,24 May 2012
Prometheus," Just Let Go
","There are a few things i've learned from all the 'games' around this movie. Michael Fassbender has made the film Gods furious (don't ask me why), Ridley Scott is also trying stuff, and viral videos or many extended trailers are bad for your mental health and judgment. So, blow away the fog of prejudice that's fallen over Hollywood, pay attention to the film and find out whether you like it or not, whether it's related to Alien or NOT.One of the first few premier screenings of Prometheus was in 3D. Still, i don't think that any other film can be as great in 3D as Avatar. Most of the times, during watching, i was taking off the glasses to rest my eyes. It was like watching a 2D movie with an unnecessary filter. My expectations were high, due to the visual effects that were introduced in the trailers, but it appeared that one can pleasantly watch it in 2D (so keep that money for an extra cup of your favorite beverage).The story is simple. A team of scientist funded by a big technological corporation (Weyland Industries) are setting a course to a distant planet in search of the origins of mankind, based on the 'writings' of a cave wall and considering it as a message from the creators of humanity.The 'actual' cast is rather limited. Michael Fassbender performs very accurate as the android who escorts the team to -originaly- help the scientists and plays an important role through-out the film. The other important character is Noomi Rapace's Elizabeth Shaw. I think the film makers wanted a new version of Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley, but no! The rest of the cast is mostly supportive, like Charlize Theron, Logan Marshall-Green and Idris Elba. They're all very good actors but this movie didn't seem like a chance for them to rise up a bit more. Everyone else seemed dispensable and their actions predictable enough to figure out for yourself on 'who stays till the end'.The visual effects are quite rewarding with some really great photography and a few of Ridley Scott's cinematic tricks and camera takes. There are some flaws, if you watch carefully. I see it as a game like Spot The Differences or What's Wrong With This Picture! That's interesting.Truth is, i was never interested in the Alien movies (even though i'm a huge sci-fi fan). I know their story but none of it got me to follow religiously and blindly Ridley Scott's work -there are other films for that-. Here's the good news: You don't have to have seen Alien to watch Prometheus. If you've ever heard of it, that's good but not essential.Overall, it's a great sci-fi film, worth watching, makes the difference between all those remakes and comic book based films that are laying around lately. Could be called original (could be) and definitely needs (will be) a sequel.",8,4,7,15 August 2012
