Hidden Figures," This movie is both inspiring and entertaining
",Some of the reviews seem to deny that there was segregation and prejudice in the 60's. I grew up New York which was a totally different world from the South. I remember visiting the South as a child and it's just like it is in this movie. I saw segregated toilets and Water fountains. And how cowed black people were. At the time I didn't really understand. However this movie is about so much more than that.. this movie is about the human spirit! To me this movie shows Women can do anything. No matter what their nationality is! This particular movie just highlights black woman... Which is a good thing!!!,10,2,5,12 December 2019
