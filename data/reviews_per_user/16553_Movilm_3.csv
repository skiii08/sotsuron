Changeling," A Story of Righteousness
","Good movie. Nice layers unfolding regarding the missing boy. If it wasn't a true story one might deny it's plausibility. Very good performances. The supporting actors were truly enriching for the film. Surprisingly good acting from children. Many moments where I wanted to punch out one or two characters on the screen for being such puppets, and if/when they did get what they had coming, I had to exclaim my satisfaction out loud.Made me think about how much denial of the obvious truth we all allow and are sometimes complicit in via our silence. Great examples of how sometimes people will do the most dishonest and unthinkable things, just because they are caught up in a machine, a bureaucracy, and go too far before they realize what they have really done. Great examples of how easy it is to be fooled by voices of authority, because if we can't believe them, then who do we believe?Though I would have wanted it to be a touch shorter everything seemed necessary. Maybe it was just me on this particular day.Every Eastwood directed film I've seen has such class and calm confidence, I truly enjoy his work. Once again, a great story of righteousness. You may as well stand up for what you believe in if the alternative is a life hardly worth living.",Null,2,6,24 December 2010
The Town," Good 2010 action/heist movie
","A well done action heist film. Kind of reminded me of Heat though is not of the same caliber or as 'deep' (if my memory serves me well).Renner is scary in his role. One of those performances that gets you tense for what he might do at any moment. Affleck plays a very stoic criminal mind. I got a kick out of the business place of the 'boss'.If you want to see a movie with complex heists, and typical but good tough guy performances this should do well for you. Not the most original but entertaining and well done. How many movies really are original? Very few. The differences are in the little pockets within the movie where they do things you've seen before but you still enjoy watching how they get there.Definitely renews my interest in Ben Affleck outside of comedy. I just remembered he did Gone Baby Gone. That was impressive too. Maybe I need to catch up...",Null,0,1,24 December 2010
Sicario," Great. Del Toro is worth it alone.
","Really good movie. Benecio Del Toro is fantastic. Very laconic. A well written and played character. Emily Blunt's character is fairly typical but serves the story and her performance is great. Brolin is very good, character also a little typical but not necessarily predictable. He seems relaxed in his performance. He's been on a role, and being well cast since the Coen brothers put him in No Country for Old Men. Well, what I've seen of him.Great pacing. No drag. Good to great action that doesn't feel gratuitous. Great, believable sets, and settings. The action doesn't get too visually crowded which is hard to find. It's patiently displayed and deliberate.I'd watch this again. I've currently seen it once.",Null,1,2,16 January 2016
