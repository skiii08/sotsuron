The Blair Witch Project," I'm not so scared...
","... but I had a lot of fun.I am not a big fan of horror movies, and I generally prefer films that have high production values, however, I must admit that I was impressed both with the set-up and the execution of this film.Although the beginning of the film (before their first night) was a really good set-up to the terror part of the movie, I did have trouble believing the characters. I had a few good laughs, and when the creepy stuff started to happen, it was an about-face to what had previously been presented. I was excited when the creepy stuff started to happen, but wasn't scared.About half way through, the annoying over-acting of Heather really began to get to me (along with the heat in the theater) and I began to lose interest in what was going to happen the next time they heard noises outside.BUT it was worth it to see the final scene, which scared the crap out of me and still leaves me with goose-bumps. Although I don't think this film is the scariest movie ever made, I'm certain that its the scariest film ever made with a micro-budget and no professionals. And the last scene will stick with you forever.",8,1,2,17 July 1999
