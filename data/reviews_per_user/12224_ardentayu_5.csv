The Hangover," I Couldn't Stop Laughing
","This is really very funny, provided that you like shock humor, crude humor, situational humor, ridiculous circumstances, etc. I didn't even think the preview I saw looked that funny, so I was surprised when the story got underway and I couldn't stop laughing. The main characters' personalities vary so much that much of the comedy too comes from the quirky character traits they have - and how that causes each of them to react differently the absurd situations they have gotten themselves into. This R-rated comedy is a nice departure from the films of Judd Apatow or the comedies of Will Ferrell or Adam Sandler. I'm not saying I don't like those other guys, but sometimes it seems like those are the main comedy options (along with romantic comedies or family comedies). Well, here's a new, original, hilarious comedy. Loved it!",9,3,6,4 August 2009
In Bruges," Funny & Quirky  good suspense in the end!
","I loved this movie. I saw it at Sundance. Probably best classified as a dark comedy, IN BRUGES has a mix of comedy, drama, and action. There are a few violent scenes. Great job by writer/director Martin McDonagh.The movie made me laugh from the opening note: Colin Farrell's voice over during the opening credits asking 'Where the fook is Bruges?' The movie follows two hit men stuck in Bruges awaiting the next order from their boss. Farrell is dealing with some of his own personal demons. Much of the first half of the movie is talking heads, but due to the clever writing and comedic moments (often cynical and not-PC), the movie never gets stale. Both lead actors  Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson  are the superb and they make the perfect odd couple. It is nice to see Colin Farrell playing a role other than the cool, slick guy. Farrell's character verges on whiney, but that is part of what makes him endearing. Ralph Fiennes add a bad guy to the mix of eclectic characters.",9,3,7,13 February 2008
The Witch," Eerie and Creepy.... but...
","The atmosphere of this film is stellar. The setup of the family being ousted from their village and heading into the woods to live alone really drives home how incredibly lonely it must have been for many people back then. Without regular contact with others, some families only interacted with each other. This film sets up the extreme version of that, with the family deep in the woods. It is bleak and disturbing, even before anything supernatural happens. The acting is good, but it lacked the depth of character development that I needed to really care about the characters. Rather than feeling emotionally invested, I just felt like, 'Hmm, that's interesting.' And it often was. Though at times it was also quite slow. For such a hyped film, I though much of the critical lavish praise was overdone, but it's always nice to see a low-budget indie film breakout.",6,1,2,2 February 2018
Mudbound," Well done
","This movie does a great job of capturing the difficulties of the post World War II world in America - the struggle to make a living as a farmer and the problems that the deeply embedded racism brought to families, black and white. Set in rural Mississippi, the story follows two families (one white and in ownership of the land) and the other black (and working the land). It shows the intersection and power balance between the families, all leading to tragic circumstances. I thought it was well done and its one of the better 'Netflix Originals' that I've seen. Not sure it's worthy of an Oscar nom, but I don't like many Oscar noms anyway, and I liked this one much better than most of the other 2018 nominated films.",8,2,5,6 February 2019
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," The second half is better than the first
","I wanted to love this. I love WWII stories and I love true stories and I love movies about literature. While this ticked all those boxes, it didn't come together as an entire film. The biggest issue is that all of the elements of the story in the first half of the story that are ripe with the MOST conflict (the Nazis taking over Guernsey Island, a group almost being arrested for it, the formation of a pretend book club that in turn becomes a real book club) are told in flashback, which robs the story of immediacy and tension. Later, there is some conflict and drama that arises in real time, and it has a touching ending which save it from being a lower score. Great setting on the English channel, great actors, great concept - just not delivered in the most satisfying way.",6,1,2,1 January 2019
