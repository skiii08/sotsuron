Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Even more detail
","This film definitely adds a lot of detail for a hungry palate left over from the first one. If you have any questions unanswered from the first one, this film definitely answers them. The lush scenery is absolutely amazing. And you also get a real mystical sense that anything is possible (taking into account the kung fu aspect of it, which is learned and practiced by the Bride). There's a real spooky element to various aspects of the film, and the film really succeeds in drawing the viewer into its story. There is also a vague feeling that this movie is about a decade ahead of its time in terms of artistry in general, and especially of independent films. To put it simply, not even one tenth of the stuff shown on IFC or Sundance even holds a candle to this film and the previous. Well done!",10,0,1,15 November 2009
Requiem for a Dream," Amazing movie.
","I notice that this movie doesn't always get a good rating in various places, but I for one liked it, enormously. I thought that it was enormously creative. It's a very avant-garde movie, but I don't think that it would be fair to categorize as just artsy or arty. That said, it is an amazingly contemporary study of drugs in general. It basically shoots you in the gut with that message. But I just have to say that hand's down Ellen Burstyn is the greatest thing about this movie. There's an extremely hallucinatory scene that just blows your mind away. Not to say that the special effects came into play because of her performance, but sometimes I just think that the magical effect of the actors artistry somehow has something to do with whether a scene is good or not. This movie is definitely not for the squeamish, and Jennifer Connelly is also superb.",10,0,1,18 November 2009
12 Monkeys," Bizarre and yet interesting
","This was a bizarre and yet very interesting film. It has a very dark and grimy feel to it. Bruce Willis' acting is very bizarre, not to mention Brad Pitt who plays a mental patient. This is perhaps Terry Gilliams' masterpiece (although I haven't seen Brazil). There is a very surreal quality to all the scenes, it sort of just takes you away. It has a very subtle plot, and you have to make sure you're following the movie very carefully and at a rapid pace or else you'd have to watch a major chunk of the movie again (this is especially true of someone who's never seen the movie before). It's a very lush and haunting movie, sometimes jarring even. There's a part in the movie that implies that the present is to some extent seeded with people from the future (or the past, I can't remember which (or even perhaps both, I'm sorry for the confusion, see, that's how the movie is!)). The comical parts would be exactly just that, comical; if they weren't so disturbing. This is the kind of movie that you definitely want to buy (and not just rent), to add to your collection. Serious movie buffs will be impressed.",10,0,0,18 November 2009
L.A. Confidential," Excellent
","This film is great from start to absolute finish. The interesting thing is that it is obviously set in Los Angeles; and I personally hate Los Angeles (I live here), but this is Los Angeles in a supernatural reality. There's nothing overtly fantastical about this movie, but its almost as if you imagine every villain in this movie to be a demon (and the villains aren't always cut and dried, even the 'heroes' are suffering from some type of pathos). In terms of my favorite Russell Crowe movie, this is it. I can't remember if they actually describe him in the movie as being all brawn and no brain; but that exactly describes his character. This is the first movie that I ever saw Guy Pearce in, and I fell in love with his acting ability. Kim Basinger is great too, and her acting is ironically understated. I've lived in L.A. all my life, but this is an L.A. that I'm not really used to; but definitely like. There is a really strong visual component to the movie. Very vivid.",10,1,3,18 November 2009
Match Point," Great, and yet hard to watch
","This is not your typical Woody Allen movie. This movie tears up your insides and spits them out. There is a certain ambivalence felt towards the characters, you don't know if to hate them, or feel for them. This is a very intense movie, I don't recommend it to the sensitive viewer. I myself am not easily stirred emotionally, but yet found this movie hard to watch. If you thought that Woody Allen was a comedy master and that's it; think again. This movie at the same time that it reaches a peak of intensity, also hits a fair degree of symbolism; especially towards the end. It's kind of hard to talk about this movie without revealing the end, but I definitely recommend this movie; for the emotionally stable. Ha,ha. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is one of the best things about this movie as well.",10,0,2,18 November 2009
Milk," Does the body good.
","The best thing about this movie, by far, is Sean Penn. His acting in this movie is just otherworldly. Diego Luna is sort of annoying in the scenes that he's in. His is a very sensationalistic performance. And James Franco as in most (if not all) of his films is great. Josh Brolin also turns an interesting role. Whether you believe in gay marriage or not, this film is set at a time when marriage was not the issue, gays were just blacklisted from jobs and for example, renting apartments. That I think is something that nobody should advocate. And that is a message that is very effective in this movie. But I think that it's good that Sean Penn is the lead actor because he just steals the show. I seriously recommend this movie, for anybody.",10,0,2,18 November 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Samurai masterpiece
",I think that this film is a clever masterpiece. If I could say that there's anything wrong with it; it's that its almost too clever (if that can even be something wrong). From the beginning Tarantino absolutely just bombards you with various amounts of imagery. What I find absolutely interesting about it was the combination of colors used from the set design to costume. From start to finish this film is just completely psychedelic. This film is also stunning when it comes to the sound effects used. You get this real sense of a subliminal mythology; and there's even an arc between films when you see the product of cigarettes advertised in this film that's mentioned in Pulp Fiction. But the thing is just when you think Quentin's run out of ammo...wait...there's more...,10,3,8,15 November 2009
Pulp Fiction," Still works
","I think that I might have ruined this movie for myself. I watched this movie over and over, ad nauseum in my 20's. I think that parts of it are dated and should remain in the 90's vault, but I think that for the most part this movie is transcendent. For anyone who's ever read my other comments you'll know that my idea of a masterpiece is a movie that pulsates with a mystical otherworldly vibe, and I'd have to say that most of this movie is like that. This movie has been parodied by the likes of The Simpsons, and been referenced by serious critics, and for good reason. This movie definitely resonates with the archetypal sophomore vibe; while it doesn't have the innocence of Reservoir Dogs, or the maneuverability of the Kill Bill series, it definitely stands on its own. It is also one of the more charming, and highly appealing of the Generation X stoner flicks. Let me just say that if I could give this movie beyonder points, I'd give it a 16 for eerily supernatural. Great, great work.",10,1,2,15 November 2009
Gangs of New York," Underrated
","This is probably the most underrated movie of 2002. I have to admit that certain details of the movie are cheesy, but I still think that it's a good movie. The best thing of course, by far, is Daniel Day Lewis. The interesting thing is that the grittiness makes you speculate about the foundations of the gangs that exist today. Even the recreation of some aspects of the gang wear makes you think about this. The sort of flair, in other words, utilized by some gang members today. That said, there is something definitely eerie about Daniel Day Lewis' performance. I guess you could call it a caricature, but a definitely fascinating one. We can only speculate at the amount of melodramatic style gang members of that day would behave as, but Day Lewis' helps in bringing you into the cartoonish world that must have been. I sort of don't know if DiCaprio resigned himself to be worked around by Day Lewis, or what; but his acting and character still remain at least vaguely interesting (and yet completely eclipsed by Daniel Day Lewis' performance). This movie is good historical fare, and one of Day Lewis' best performances. While it isn't Martin Scorsese's best movie, (I think that Goodfellas takes care of that..) it is definitely a step up above most movies. Completely evocative.",10,0,1,15 November 2009
