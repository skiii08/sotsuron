Blade Runner 2049," regular Hollywood crap disguised as 'a masterpiece'.
","i will give it 3 for the efforts in beautiful design and shooting.ALL THE REST - directing, script, characters, music, editing - BAD BAD BAD.seriously - go watch the 3 shorts they done to promote this. they are way better.let me dig deeper: directing - i respected and trusted Hollywood's wonder boy, villeneuve - until now. this heavy load of a responsibility was not for him. he fails in delivering the true gritty vibe needed for this. i bet his hands got tied with the studio, they probably changed editing, script etc, and he bailed out. creating a beautiful CGI world is not enough, sorry.script - starts interesting and after 20 minutes turns into usual empty, soulless, Hollywood of today's blockbusters. nothing feels genuine, all is explained a few times, for us dumb audience. the story is so simple, and the script stretches it so it all fails. it's not smart, not tight, not intelligent. it's bad. characters - flat and hollow. they all feel unnatural (OPPOSITE of the original), delivering the performance that is 'needed', no more. Ford pops up for a minimum effort (almost like 'the Force Awakens'), and is nothing like Deckard's original character. pathetic. the Leto character is a cardboard villain. and of course Gosling. what an excuse for playing a stiff android. terrible.music - Zimmer's usual Inception trademark. the lowest point was using 'Tears In Rain' which is the most beautiful Vangelis tune ever, and used it in the ending to squeeze some fake emotion from us. can't believe villeneuve agreed to this crap. editing - by editing i mean - take 30 min. off this, even an hour. lose many unneeded parts. shorten all scenes. at least people will be able to enjoy a bit of eye candy instead of suffering.the first film is very good IMO. go watch any scene in YT to remember how much better it is. quality sci-fi at it's best.the word 'masterpiece' is mentioned regarding the new film. so don't believe it. you won't miss any 'subtleties' as the 'worsheepers' of this crap say. there aren't. if this film settles on a 7 rating, it should be an honor.",3,46,96,16 October 2017
