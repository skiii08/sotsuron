Ford v Ferrari," Started my engines
","Watching cars race around a track hasn't meant much to me since I grew out of scalextric, but this film's trailer brought some of those memories back and I jumped at a chance to see it. Fortunately this movie is so much more than cars racing around a track, as central as that is to the whole story. Bale and Damon are terrific. The whole cast were great actually. The story is gripping. The cinematography is awesome. The tale is bitter sweet. Just like any good dish should be. You don't have to be a petrol head to enjoy it, but if you are, there's very few car movies as good as this one. I never thought I'd see the day I'd be cheering for a Ford win, but this film took me there. Imagine a modern day take on 'Grand Prix' with James Garner but with Le Mans, not f1. And Ford not Honda. It's a winner for me.",8,1,6,15 November 2019
Rocketman," Reg gets on a roll
",Enjoyable take on Elton Johns rise from a shy little boy to outrageous artist. Yes it's not strictly accurate but it is highly entertaining. If you're not flooded with memories while you watch and listen to this movie you mustn't have been breathing in the 70s.,7,0,2,8 July 2019
A Star Is Born," Moving story
","What a fantastic effort by Bradley Cooper and Gaga. The time just flew by as I was drawn into the story about one star helping a new one to rise, all the while unable to help himself keep rising. It may help that I don't remember the earlier versions, I'm not sure. I do know I liked both characters and was moved by their underlying loyalty and care for each other - despite their faults or fears that ultimately needed to be overcome. It's a tear jerker, so that's my caveat. Go see it but be prepared to be upset. It's a great film.",8,4,7,20 November 2018
The Irishman," Favors come at a price
","A convincing saga on the threads that bound American gangsters, politics and unions in post-war U S of A. It's not as dramatic as say the godfather, but rather highlights the banality of it all as it builds tension. It's long. Over 3 hours but I never got bored. DeNiro, Pacino and Pesci all deliver. It takes a stab at some long standing Jimmy Hoffa and Kennedy conspiracy theories and pins them proudly. If you reckon the world's corrupt and It's kill or be killed out there, this won't dissuade you.",8,4,12,24 November 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Backstage view of rock royalty
",Thoroughly enjoyable ride following Freddie Mercury's role in the Queen phenomenon. It's a pretty sanitized view I'm guessing but it felt right to concentrate on the great music more than the detail of the other stuff. (As critical as all that was into who he was and how he performed.). If you love their songs you'll love this movie.,7,1,4,16 November 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A trippy daydream
","A brilliant portrayal of another era that feels like an authentic daydream to me and probably anyone else who was around back then. It burns in moments and drifts like a river the rest of the time. If you could take the best moments of a time in your history and then spin it around to a way that could make it better, you might be able to do what Tarantino's done here. It's a trip alright.",7,0,0,20 August 2019
Aladdin," Cartoon comes to life
","Sure, it's a pc version of the animated story but don't be put off by this retailing in live action. It's polished. It's classic disney at the end of the day.",7,0,2,8 June 2019
The Lion King," Disney taking care of all the light touches...
","We all know that Sade song about 'never as good as the first time' but rarely does that stop anyone going back to the well. Seriously, you have to be sad as Scar to give the low 5 out of 10 average score I've been seeing on IMDB for this live action retelling of the lion king. It is a masterpiece technically, amazing cgi. We've come a long way from 'Babe' the talking pig. I get the deja vu comments and going in I was worried about how I was going to cope with all of that. Add on top the 'suspension of disbelief' dilemma (given how real the animals are now compared to the characterization animation allowed originally) and I understand some apprehension. But geeze Louise, you have to be picky and really hate Disney (I know there's a lot of you out there) to call this movie average. It's hard to believe adults like this exist but I took my partner who had never seen the original and I watched her laugh and gasp at all the same points I did when I first saw the story. So I know the story is still a winner. The songs still zing. Just sit back and let the new look magic wash over you. Hakuna matata it you might say. My cinema was full on a wed night so I suspect Disney will KaChing another one here. It deserves a 9 or a 10 really but I'm giving it an 8 because second time around I'm comparing the impact and minor differences with the surprise punch you only get first time around. See it. Marvel at how amazing it looks. Sing the songs again in your heart. It's a movie. A masterpiece achievement I think.",8,1,3,17 July 2019
Whiplash," A different kind of beat
","It's different. It's tight. It's tense. I'm glad I saw it, but it's not a movie I want to see again. It tells its story well. Maybe it's just that the story is a little too real to be as entertaining as I wanted it be. The truth about what it takes to be great is harder than that. There is no fairy floss. There is is no escapism. Just bleeding knuckles.",7,0,0,21 October 2018
Parasite," Humorous class struggle mixed with a little Kimchi
",Enjoyable ride through class differences in modern South Korea with an unexpected kick. It's very cleverly constructed and well acted. It's a fun ride and has a hint of Tarantino about it.,7,5,21,10 July 2019
Green Book," Yin and yang make each other whole.
",Well crafted movie with a good heart and a story worth telling. It was an enjoyable storyline to watch play out. I didn't see a best picture win coming when I watched it however and maybe I'd have expected too much if I did. It's a nice ride in a time machine with the added bonus of discovering not everyone in that era was as bad as they seem in hindsight.,7,1,2,27 February 2019
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," This doesn't need rescuing
",Hilarious and so prescient. Full of classic scenes that forever bring a smile and illuminate history from a unique perspective. From a time when political correctness didn't get in the way of a giggle. Genius.,9,2,2,24 November 2019
Slumdog Millionaire," A movie with all the right answers
",I walked out of this movie blown away by the ride of my life. How fresh. How intoxicating. How moving a journey. Film making by film makers at the top of their craft.,10,0,0,21 October 2018
