Antz," A thoroughly enchanting blend of animation and satire, 'Antz' will thrill the entire family!
","'Antz' is a thoroughly involving film, filled to the brim with lovingly constructed visuals and a number of clever plot twists.  If it contained nothing more than entertaining visuals and humorous characters, the film would be perfectly acceptable.  But the creators didn't rest on their laurels; surprisingly, 'Antz' sneaks a fair amount of social commentary into its frames.  It's not hard to recognize ourselves and modern society in the movie, which is perhaps the reason the tale works so well: we all know people who act like the various inhabitants of the ant hill.The intelligence of the screenplay was one of the biggest (and nicest) surprises for me.  In addition to the predictable (though admittedly well done) gags involving magnifying glasses and picnics, 'Antz' depicts a level of religious satire uncommon in what's ostensibly a kids' movie.  Social satire also appears -- the story's biggest laugh comes when an insightful worker ant experiences a revelation: 'The workers control the means of production!'",8,0,0,28 September 2000
