Iron Man 3," Good comedy film... not the best for fans though.
","This film was a nice entry in the Ironman series, although probably not the film fans of the comics would of wanted. Being both, a fan of the films and comics I was perched on the fence with this one. First of all the cast were great Downey Jr is a brilliant Tony Stark and I thought the film was quite amusing in places, a great film for the casual fan. Although maybe fans of the comics should give this a wide berth. When I read that the Extremis storyline was going to be the basis of the film I was excited, but this film doesn't retain the dark brooding tone that I would come to expect from such a story arc. The mandarin character gets put through the ringer as well and could be seen as a bit of a middle finger to the fans (although Kingsley is pretty funny.) Anyway my least favorite film of the series but still a good, enjoyable film.",7,1,2,11 May 2013
Man of Steel," Very disappointing to say the least.
","'Man of Steel' was void of all the integral elements needed to make a good and interesting film. The character development felt like filler, the plot was unnecessarily over the top and story was full of holes and constantly trying to perpetuate itself to the next fight scene. This is not the Superman story I wanted to see. The fact that because Superman is this all powerful, demigod kind of character doesn't mean he needs an epic film. I would of been happier if it focused on the romance with Lois, how he got his morals and why he does the right thing, because with this rendition of Superman I'm really not sure. Thematically speaking this film is all over the place, it just has no identity just lots of CGI and money thrown at it.It really has the overly serious Nolan/Batman atmosphere where I think with a character like Superman Snyder should of taken a leaf out of Marvel's book and made the film fun.",2,9,18,14 June 2013
Evil Dead," Not bad but lacked the intrigue of the original.
","Hmmm, where to start, this film isn't really even a remake, not in my book. It has a few references if you know where to look and it tries to have the suspenseful and foreboding atmosphere of the original but lets go of the scares too quickly and plunges straight into a gorefest. I'm not saying it's a bad film, it just doesn't have the imagination of the original. It has the blood and gore down, there are some real nice wince inducing moments, but the real horror isn't in the gore it's in the other elements which make a truly frightening horror film. The psychological fear of the unknown menace, keeping the original characters isolated in the woods is gone. However this is replaced by gore and bodily punishment, of which the characters seem to shrug off with relative ease, lessening the horror and desensitizing the audience to the carnage on screen. All in all a good but not great horror film. It had the shock factor but not enough of the 'originals' terror. Maybe the director tried a little too hard to out-do instead of re-do and missed a few of the important aspects which made 'The Evil Dead' a cult classic.",6,1,10,11 May 2013
