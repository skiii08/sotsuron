Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The WORST ever movie (and I really mean it!!0
","This is the worst ever movie I've ever seen, I really don't know why I've spent my time watching it?! Lack of attractive story, lack of effects, lack of comedy, lack of plot, lack .. lack ...I really can't find any attractive or positive point in such a gango-pango collection of strange scenes and words that made that movie .. and as a try to compensate the lack of everything .. A cheap trials for sexual offending and nudity as to complete the failure !!I really don't like the idea of making fun all the time of all kinds and types of people, also I didn't like the idea that the Kazakh are that stupid.. This is not true and insulting, and if we suppose that this strange psycho is a Kazakh (obviously there's no such psycho in Kazakhstan or any other places in the world except in his homeland), if we just supposed that, so why are you running after the Americans and wearing their outfits and cloning their styles ??!! Don't you have dignity or a unique personality ..?! I don't know how such a nonsense is called a movie !! *** Lo'ay",1,2,8,14 December 2007
Forrest Gump," The life through the eyes of Forrest Gump
","This is really the best movie I had ever seen in my whole life.. incredible .. stunning .. magnificent and sensitive ..I saw this movie for the first time when I was in the university in the middle of the 90s and I was really amazed of the great performance by Tom Hanks and the great motion and effects and screenplay by the genius Robert Zemics ..The movie talks about the history of Forrest Gump .. a low IQed kid who could live and amazingly succeed in the life with his own self and with his pure soul and simple mind ..Forrest lived really great historical events in the American history such like: The end of the American era of Racism against the blacks, Kennedy's rise and assassination, The cold war, The 1st man on the moon, The American failure in Vietnam, the era of the Heapies and punks, Watergate and the resign of Nixon, the failed assassination trial on Regan .. He met a lot of important key characters (Which were presented live and in complete interaction with Forrest Gump by the Genius effects and mixing by Zemics) like: Elvis Presley, John F. Kennedy, John Lennon, Johnson and Nixon ..All his life was full of surprises and hits of golden touches of luck .. he went to Vietnam and was the only survivor of his unit, he became a millionaire and the owner of a great shrimp investment enterprise and a famous personality but he has never changed or skipped his innocent dreams of principals ..His world was limited in his mom (Sally Field), His only love in life Jenny (Robin Penn), His unit Lt. in Vietnam and later his friend and partner Lt. Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise), His only friend and inspirer Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) and with these characters he was living his dreams and whole life .. a life of complete innocence and purity ..A Genius look from Robert Zemics was the flying white feather .. A feather that is flying and wandering in the air .. and is motioned only by the force of the air breezes .. this represent the life and nature of Forrest Gump .. to live the life with its currents and incidents and to be able to survive and take it simply in each condition ..Really this was the best ever role performed by Tom Hanks which was REALLY great and magnificent .. also the role of Gary Sinise was great .. I almost believed that his legs were really cut off !! The life through Forrest Gump's eyes are really different .. simpler .. nicer and brighter ..Thanks Tommy!! *** Lo'ay",10,2,5,7 May 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," The Reverse story of Benjamin Button
","This is really one of the best movies I've ever watched lately, It's really almost optimum in all (Performance, makeup, photography, selection of the characters, places and decorations, ...) really this masterpiece deserved all it was nominated for ..The story is mainly about the reading in the dairy of Benjamin Button, these diaries were read by Caroline (Julia Ormond) - A young lady - to her dying mother: Mrs Daisy (Cate Blanchett) in the hospital under a quite threat of a nearing twister heading to this hospital ..The dying mother Daisy mentioned the story of the great clock in the station which was designed and manufactured by Monsieur Gateau (Faune A. Chambers)in 1918, as a result for his great sorrow and pain for the loss for his only son in the great war, he had designed the clock to tick backwards in the reverse direction and he went away ..The diaries were dated on 1985 and were written by Benjamin Button, he talked about his strange and curious case since his birth, his mother died after she gave him birth in 1918 after the end of the great WWI, his father was obsessed by the idea that the baby is a freak, got rid of him by leaving him at the door of a retirement care house, A maid in this retirement house called Queenie (Taraji P. Henson) found him and took care of him as a son to her as she has a problem and can't give birth to a baby ..It was found that he baby had all the diseases and look of an aging dying old man (An old man of about 85 years old !!) like the cataract, deafness, .. etc and the doctor predicted that the baby won't last living more than days or weeks at most!! The baby lived .. and had grown up under the care of the kind Queenie to be like a very old man like those in the retirement house .. as he was 5 years old he looked like an 80 years old aging man ..By time it was clear that Benjamin Button was getting younger in body and look while he was getting older and more mature in mentality over the time. he had regained the ability to walk normally, his hearing became better and his sight became sharper .. he met Daisy (Cate Blanchett) as she was a little child living with her old grandmother Tizzy in the retirement house, Daisy liked Benjamin and liked to be closer to him since the first time she saw him ...Life went on with Benjamin who was getting younger and younger .. and he gained the experiences of life as he was getting younger, he learned to drink, make love and relationships and to work .. he faced a lot of situations like facing a German U-boat on the boat he was working on .. he found his father Mr Thomas Button who told him the truth about his life before he die ..Finally he found Daisy again .. she was working as a famous Ballet dancer and living a dissolute life and ignored him .. she had a terrible accident in Paris and everybody left her except him .. this made her love him in return .. now she was 43 years old while he was in the form of a young man in the middle of 30s of his age .. they lived in a continuous love .. she became pregnant and gave birth ..They realized that time is stronger than them .. Daisy became older and Benjamin became younger and he realized that he can no longer live with her and take care of the baby Caroline .. and so he left them and went away ..At last Benjamin became an old boy and then a baby .. old Daisy took care of him .. at the end of year 2002 .. the old station clock made by Monsieur Gateau was replaced by a new one .. in the year 2003 and in a tragic scene .. between the arms of Daisy, Benjamin dies .. after the end of the story the dying Daisy dies in peace ..Really a great picture and performance and one of the best ever movies I had ever seen to Brad Pitt who reached the top in his performance in performing the different ages of Benjamin Button and also by Cate Blanchett which was in her best roles as Daisy as a teenager girl and a dancer with no sense of responsibility then a lover then a mother and an old lady ..also the makeup, directing and decorations were excellent and returning us back to the days of the 30s, 40s, and 50s with high professionalism .. also the great human meanings and scenes .. You are you .. you are your soul and not only your body .. love has no age or era ..Thanks Braddie !! *** Lo'ay",9,2,5,1 March 2009
Bruce Almighty," Heathen AND Silly!!
","The worst and the most heathen idea that a respected writer, director producer and cast can think ofOh my god!! Is that creativity and new thinking that we make fun of our god?!To make him be performed in person as a silly character?! And to make god to spare his great powers to a silly miserable human of his own creation??!! And that this miserable human uses the great powers of GOD for his own stupid mortal benefits??!!!Oh I'm really disappointed that such a group of good actors go to act in such shallow and heathen pictureWhy Morgan??!! I used to love you and respect you .. About Jim and Jen I don't care a bit about them as their rankings and careers are continuously degrading since this movie till now .. I'm not sorry for them as they've decided to commit their own career suicide by their own free will ..Please everyone we need to return to god .. To be true believers the he is only one god .. God created the universe, the skies an earth, the humans and all the creatures and the paradise and the hell ..God is only one, he is the first and he is the last he has no wife or sons, he wasn't born and has no sonsNothing is like god in the whole universe.. God is the light of the skies and earth ..God sent us the prophets like Mosses, Jessus and Mohamed (peace be upon them all) to learn us to worship him and to follow his orders and to get closer to him to be eligible to have his blessings and to be eligible to enter the paradise ..That's the real great faith. That's the real great way. That's the real great win ..Sorry Jimmy *** Loay",1,1,7,18 September 2009
300," A movie for Children !!
","I love the Greek heroic battles as the battles of Alexander the great, Also I love the Greek mythologies such as the tales of gods .. and I think this movie particularly a mythology ..I admit and realize that this movie is based on a real historic fact, but the fact is that these 300 Spartans are human beings and not 300 Hercules' and Achilies' A lot of scenes of this movie are far from realistic and reasonable accidents.<ul><li>Do you believe that 300 men with their shields can stop a huge concentrated strike of a huge army of hundreds of thousand of the strongest warriors of the world without any affect on these Shields ??!! event if these shields are made of Titanium or event adamant !! </li></ul><ul><li>Do you believe that a Persian man of about 4 meters tall is attacking the Spartans in the night and when the Spartans tried to cut his limbs off, the swords were broken on the limbs as if these limbs are metallic !! So the Persians were using Robots !! Nah !! </li></ul><ul><li>Do you believe that normal human beings could defeat an army using elephants and rhinoceros' and kill them all !!, I can believe so if you only can believe that men with swords can fight and defeat an army of tanks!! </li></ul><ul><li>Do you believe that the Persians were blacks and ugly looking as if they are demons with rings and chains in their faces and eyes as if they are heathen clown slaves ??!! </li></ul>I believe and the realize that the Spartans were heroes and braves .. but this is making me sick to watch such a comedy which is far from reason and to call it a historical movie .. Really I'm impressed with the quality of the CGI imaging and effects and the volume of the continuous shouts and cries of Leonidas and after all these shouts, yellings and cries he could speak without losing his voice !! .. What a hero and a man !! Really this movie should be presented only for children .. they may believe this historical fantasy !! Sorry Frankie *** Lo'ay",1,2,4,6 October 2007
