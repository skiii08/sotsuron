Hereditary," Funny
","I watched Avengers 2 and Deadpool 2 both would make Disney sick...Waititi makes good stuff....but, America is getting really bad at making movies...Avangers and Deadpool are just genocide and father killing daughter and son killing father and guys using computers to make movies...all of them are the same...Downey Jr. made one ok movie since he got sober...some flick with Jamie Fox or Will Smith in it...i'm into the first 20 minutes of this show and i'm writing this...when i dislike a film i go to IMBD and look at the people who hate the flick to see what they have to say...and we agree, usually....sad to say this is just 'background' stuff....i walk around the house and glance at it now and then....the acting is wonderful and that's it...a collage of emotions splattered on the screen...a rosarch of whatever....mental and emotional jabberwocky....it's all hilarious....a hodgepodge of emoting, posturing...kinda like being in an 'acting class'...i think if a person just enjoyed this as , maybe , a 'meditation' of sorts to help bring on an evening's dreams it would work...but, not as a movie to 'entertain'...this show is not junk like Avengers and Deadpool or a rip off...maybe i'm just not ready for this yet...i'm 75 and i straight...if i were stoned i may like it...if i were younger , stoned or straight, i might dig it....i want to see Sicario 2 ... gees, i hope that's not going to let me down...i must say among all the stuff out there on Netflix or Amazon there is less than 1% i can stomach...Anthony Bourdain's stuff loved it all, breath taking right on great historian and sociologist (and chef) and humanitarian but he went and hung himself...nobody at CNN even warned him he was drinking himself to death...no narcotics in his body...alcohol is a narcotic and Anthony spent his whole show in Chicago at a bar and drank himself through the last season...entertainment industry folks are terrible people, generally...Disney and Marvel and most of them are not good people",3,0,5,7 September 2018
Darkest Hour," Ok but
","Slow show with nothing that pulled me in. Oldman is great but all the Churchill performances by other actors were as good. Nothing going on. Good architecture and attention to detail. Oldman more captivating in 'True Romance', Dracula and 'The Professional' (of course!)",5,11,16,8 March 2018
Aquaman," My Goodness Me
","It is this type of message and mentality that causes the Sri Lankas and Aucklands..duality , takes sides, violence, black vs white thinking, evil vs good (the world is round but hollywood has to take sides perpetuating fighting and killing and competing and pride...horrid show...i felt nothing but what a piece of junk it is and i compared it to New Zealand's Waitit or whoever...acting was bad , writing trite...they all made a bundle of dough and can write checks to Sri Lanka...stuff like this is what suicide bombers watch before 'pulling a job' but , in their minds they are the 'whites', 'the rights'...there are only consequences and the consequence of films like this taken at all seriously or engaged in by people results in the idiofication of humanity...",1,1,6,23 April 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," ok
","Wow...this is way over rated and i don't understand why the 'experts' give such high marks like on Rotten Tomatoes...i suppose it's a matter of taste...the acting is excellent and the show is well worth watching...without the quality actors in this the show would be a dud...wonderful 'messages' , fine acting and directing...the story is good enough...but, it is 'slow' and there's none of the big deal violence i've seen others say there is...the ending is a dud also...but, i think it's a worthwhile flick to see better than most but not nearly as good as it could have been.",7,0,2,28 February 2018
Baby Driver," Just a Fun Time
","Corn ballish at the start but picks up all along. The show is simply light hearted fun, fast, good acting, funny, spoofy, wild, cute, emotional not a computery gimmicky flick. I'd rather watch this way more than 'Guardians of the Galaxy's last rendition which i thought was horrid computer junk. You can see influences from other films and film makers going on. Even though the show is a long ways away from 'Natural Born Killers' there is something in this flick reminding me of 'Natural Born Killers'. I love the pacing, the innocence and the shifts taking place. And, you have to like Spacey, Fox and Hamm.",7,2,5,13 October 2017
Jackie," The rating of 6.9 is about right.
","I was blown away by the extraordinary job Natalie Portman did. I put off seeing Jackie because i didn't think Natalie could 'do' Jackie Kennedy. Wow, she had the voice, cadence, movements, gestures, EVERYTHING, down perfectly. Of course , the whole show is a fantasy. Movies are fantasies put on the screen. This show isn't a documentary or even approaching such. John Kennedy was beautifully cast and wasn't heard of much as it should be since the flick is about Jackie. The whole smoking bit was overdone. Bobby Kennedy was poorly cast but he did a good job. A critic here said 'cold' as describing the show. That's good word to describe the whole fiasco. I don't know who the director is but i'm sure he's a 'kid'. Nobody, in the film is 'old enough' to capture the times or people of the times just like the Iraq War generation has no clue what the Vietnam War was like. The Vietnam era has passed and nobody who wasn't alive during that period can feel or understand what we had going then. Youth, and oldsters alike who are 'observing' the Iraq stuff and Afghan stuff are 'far removed' from 'getting involved. The cell phone, Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin, digital generation just can't 'feel' and 'think' with 'insight'. They can't even communicate on a 'real level'. I'm so glad i lived in the Bill Halley and the Comets, Chuck Berry times. Back then we 'tuned in and dropped out'. Nowadays, people have 'tuned out and dropped out' and don't even know they are 'out of it'. On one level 'Jackie' is a joke. There's little 'real' about it other than Portman's acting is 'real good'. I didn't even come close to shedding a tear and there was no humor in the flick. The show was a dry , stilted view of the whole time. The walk with the priest was ludicrous. The show honed in a time of Jackie's life we can't come close to acting out on screen. None of us knew what she was like nor will we. Michelle Williams portrayal of Marylin Monroe was awesome but not reality. I love shows about people who we cherished or hated but have always wondered if we don't do them a disservice by trying to 'capture them on screen' by creating this 'unreal' creature planting the idea in others mind that the person, in reality, was anything like their portrayal. Movies are fantasy , made up stories. There's , presently , a boom in Winston Churchill portrayals. I guess i sound sour and old but, wow, from this old duffer's point of view this is a narrow, restricted view of Jackie's life. I wanted the show to be about 'Jackie's life not this one tiny segment of her life where she wasn't herself but showing her when they first got together and her getting together with Onasis. I think Tycoon was a fun romp at what Jackie may have been like. She makes a comment about women and power and 'going to bed' with men which was cute. Gees, the acting by Portman was a great exercise , great self indulgence , a romp , an escape from reality. Only those who lived through those times can understand. Youth nowadays would rather play video games than do anything important such as getting off their bottoms and protesting risking getting hit in the head with a belly club. If during the Vietnam War, we had the same young generation we have now, we'd still be at War. 'Jackie' was fine acting but limited in scope.",5,0,1,6 April 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," Boring
","Marvel, Disney Studios and so much of Hollywood make movies centered on violence and more violence...this show has genocide, father killing daughter, son killing dad...Hollywood 'rationalizes' that they aren't contributing to violence like school murders and needless slaughter like in Las Vegas....Hollywood and computer game folks are the major cause of continued violence...if Hollywood and computer game people had any guts they'd put a 5 year ban on such wholesale violence...switch to something interesting and engaging like sex....people won't even attempt a trial period to see if violence would be lessened by lessening violence in 'games' and 'movies'...they make excuses to just keep putting out the same junk...the music in the background is the same in all these kinds of flix...boring and utterly brainless...lousy writing and the acting doesn't even matter...I think Downey stopped acting when he stopped 'using'...a waste of money....",3,9,16,23 August 2018

Get Out," Quite the show
","This review probably won't pass inspection but i'm writing it mainly for myself to clarify some things. I like the stars and acting was good nothing super special but fine jobs by all. The flick's dialogue was OK to good. The show dragged a bit but the ending made it all worthwhile. The ending was delightful and i wish there was even gorier stuff but loved the ending. I want to give this a '10' for stirring emotions in me. Now, is where the review may be refused. The show i think will play great to black audiences and poorly but OK to white audiences. And, it will play great to the black audiences because they'll identify with the racism still rampant and 'underground' in our society. The poor under classed folks in our society will flock to this show and rate it highly. We got 2 West Wingers, Williams and Whitford, teaming up to give us some good entertainment which may near cult film status. When in college , in a black studies class , we had this principal of a school give us a talk. He was as white as white could be but Negro blood. That was when Blacks or African Americans were called Coloreds or Negroes. Now, it' Whites not Caucasians. Williams, as Chris, asked the main question near the end 'WHY BLACK PEOPLE'? and the White guy says he didn't much care. But, i think the makers of the film sure cared otherwise the show would be a flop. Nobody would ever dare try to make this film turning the tables something like this: Joseph Gordon Levitt plays Chris Washington and Regina King or Lapita Nyong'o or Andrea Lewis plays Allison William's role as Rose (i thought Amanda Pete was Rose...boy, they look alike)... and you see these other white 'servant-slaves' hanging around the house and a bunch of black people showing up at the party with a few more white 'slaves' who were hypnotized by this Black woman. Now, i'm talking black actresses not 'white black actresses'. King, Nyong'o and Danai Gurria and Lewis are what i look at as 'black black actresses' not some Haley Barry borderline black chic who could be a white chic with a nice tan. I'm getting nasty now but this film is reversed racism is what i'm saying. I'm sure it's a heck of a lot harder for a black black woman like Nyong'o or King to get a role in Hollywood than all those other 'types'. I guess i'm saying i'm sick of film makers making money on playing the race card arousing sensations they think are swell when they aren't so swell. There's an underlining double standard to this flick which is putting down white people. There's too much of it in our whole society now which is Hollywood and media talking down to 'whites' and 'blacks' alike. e.g If you watch sports ads or certain beer commercials and other commercials where there is a white guy and a black guy, the white guy will be the doofus and the black guy will be the smart one. There's even a commercial where the doofus white guy has to be on the broad shoulders of the strong black much smarter and handsomer black guy. If there's a white guy and black guy the black guy is the cool guy to be. I agree racism is real and it's still harder on Mexicans and Blacks and non Whites but shows like this and stupid commercials i'm saddened make money. The show was OK only because of the fun ending. Otherwise , it rather disgusts me. It is 'racist' against 'whites' and talks down to people.",3,2,6,24 May 2017
Silence," Grueling
","I liked, immensely, Quo Vadis, the Robe, Salmson and Delhila, Last Temptation of Christ (great Scorcese movie)...Passion of Christ and Silence was a romp in blood, torture and tedious long movies by 2 struggling Catholics trying to find their way. No mention in this movie about 'The Inquisition(s)by the Catholic Church. The attention to the costumes, language, land and Japanese culture was wonderful but the tedious length of the movie and 2hrs 40minutes of torture and philosophical mumbo jumbo is too much. Trite is the one word that comes to mind. Liam Neeson wasn't in the film but a few minutes and beginning and end and he was poorly cast and didn't pull off the role he was playing. I think this is the worst show Scorcese has done and i see no reason for a high rating. Christianity, as of 2010 is the largest religion in the world but it doesn't mean it's the best. There are so many Catholic clergy trying to spread the word to the defenseless, gullible people no wonder it's Christianity is the largest. In the USA 50% are Christian and 50% of Christians are Catholic. Neeson's statements about the Japanese believing the actual sun was believed to be the Son of God is specious and , if so , so what. That is no reason to go into a Buddhist culture and pressure them to see your way. Those or just philosophical statements referring to Silence. But, the main dislike for this show is the needless, constant, boring, ho hum torturing during the whole show. Gibson and Scorcese like blood a flowing. I think Mel Gibson was brutally beaten within an inch of his life and i think Passion of Christ was his way of alleviating some of the pain of the past. I agree with another critic here that the show would , most likely , never be made if it weren't for the famous director. I don't understand people's rating this high.",1,6,10,4 April 2017
La La Land," Forced Myself to Finish It
","I guess i'm just getting too old or don't 'get it'. There's nothing to this film that held my interest. I grew up in the Gene Kelly, Cyd Charisse, Donald O'Connor, Fred Astaire, Ziegfeld Follies, West Side Story, All That Jazz, Grease, Dirty Dancing goings-on. I'm out of touch or haven't what it takes to enjoy the cell phone/computer/digital age stuff. 'All That Jazz' has been the ultimate 'musical' for me by light years and nothing has come close to that masterpiece. I didn't think i'd like this show but i thought i'd like it more than i did but i don't. It is worse than i expected. Poorly cast and a nowhere story line as trite as it can get. I don't know why i give it 3 stars except i like the actors. Otherwise , the flick is doo doo. The actors can act but they can't sing and dance.",3,3,6,27 April 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," He May Have Been Your Father But He Wasn't Your Dadday
","The summary title exemplifies the trite dialogue all through this. I found myself eating and putzing around the house unable to give the show any attention. The music of the past seemed thrown in willy nilly. Killing , computer graphics , lots of color , more killing , more trite dialogue and little lessons Disney is supposed to teach us. 'Friggin' only he didn't say 'friggin' is Disney's way of showing they are getting liberal in their language. 'Dick, penis and a couple other words thrown in. Boring. All the computer graphics. Computergasming the entire flick. So, many movies are like watching a samo samo computer game. Violence, terrible dialogue, lame songs. The movie all looked and sounded the same to me. Killing and blasts of color.",Null,1,4,27 August 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Too long and Too silly and Too much.
","This movie is not to my liking in so many ways. First, it's a joke to see Warner Brothers kill Superman. Maybe that's what the title ought to have been. Or maybe he is going to rise from the dead. Warner does what DC Comics couldn't do. Batman turned out to be a sadist. Zena, or some women from , God knows where , comes into the mix to do a silly battle. The whole show was over the top. Seemed like they were trying to make up for the poor quality of the movie by making it long. Lot's of computer graphic stuff that is so boring nowadays. It's so much more entertaining to watch a show like 'Room' or 'Short Term 12' or a million other shows that these computer movies which seem all the same. Just the music got to be meaningless. Eisenberg was the worst guy to pick for this. I think he's a mediocre actor but terrible in this. Such poor casting. I couldn't help but compare this to Heath Ledger or any of the other bad guys. No punch to the evil guys at all, none. All other Batmans and Supermans and Spidermans were better. I have no clue why a movie called 'Captain Marvel' hasn't been made. He was my favorite star of the marvel comics. Marvel comics were made after 'Captain Marvel' so why haven't we seen him or Super Boy. This show was so lame. The last 45 minutes was nonsense. I tried hard to like it but to no avail. That being said , i think many kids would love it especially people who aren't familiar with the original comics and the meaning behind Superman. Jeremy Irons playing out classes all the others and that casting was bad. The movie has no guts no glory with a ridiculous ending. This had the makings of being a great film but got ruined all along the way. And, it seems the rankings are agreeing with how i feel. Terrible show.",2,6,11,21 July 2016
The Nice Guys," a drag
","I imagine this was liked because the stars are so wonderful in other movies they've done and we're supposed to feel an allegiance to them even though the writing is poor, the plot is ludicrous and , for me , there's no laugh and the thing drags along with a forceful attempt to make it interesting which it is not. There are so many actors who could have made this funny , perhaps. Crowe almost pulls it off. I find it hard to write enough words for this review because the show is so lame i'm speechless and can't lay enough words out there. I'm mystified why so many like it including all the sites where critics are grading it. Someone in these reviews said maybe there should be a rating added including age groups and that is interesting but i don't know if the younger group or older group would like this. I think the younger group would like this more than the older group. Maybe the younger group is 'catching' something the older group isn't getting or the generations have a vast different sense of humor. But, i think there are universal appeals. Grand Budapest Hotel, Royal Tenebaums, The Big Lebowski, 'Knocked Up' and a zillion other films have around the same ranking at 'The Nice Guys'. This is simply crazy to me. As i watching this i kept thinking maybe there's something i'm not getting, something wrong with me, maybe i'm in a bad mood and i tried to make myself like it. Just this kind of behavior in myself , now , let's me know this show plane isn't good. I come back, again, to that folks just want to have an allegiance to the actors. Most other shows these guys do are great but i think they should stay away from comedy or get better writing and directing.",3,6,12,2 September 2016
