Marie Antoinette," good entertainer but not really an historical movie
","nice movie. but if you'r hoping to learn something about the French revolution this is not the movie for you(unless you are satisfied with general information).It does though depict quite clearly and efficiently, in my point of view, the inability of both Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI in ruling the county the first for her young age and the other probably for not understanding the needs of his country. Some details turn out to be quite anachronistic the colors of the clothes, some behaviors and Marie Antoinette who appears like a modern teenager. Anyways the costumes and the scenography are surely worth seeing. Apt for teenagers who get easily bored by watching serious biographies!",4,1,2,8 June 2007
