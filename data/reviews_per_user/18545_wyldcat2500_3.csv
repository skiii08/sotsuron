Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Are you blind?
","I'm in shock at how many people missed the point of this movie. Then I remember that most of you are christians, republicans, and trailer park trash. These are exactly the things he was making fun of so therefore 'ya'll' took it personally. This movie did a great job of showing how stupid and ignorant the 'bible belt' is and how easily they are manipulated into their beliefs. This was given a healthy dose of shear comedy and slapstick (mixed vitro a great deal of crude antics that disturbed me but I found appropriate after the idea of the movie) for everyone else to keep their attention. If you are an ignorant person incapable of poking a little fun at yourself, then no this movie isn't for you and you can keep giving your kids 'time outs' while they plot their schemes to get your money before you die.",8,1,5,4 August 2007
Ghost Rider," Give it a break
","Alright, enough with your bitchy 'emo' comments. God that's lame. If you can't get entertainment value out of something then keep it to yourself. 'Emo' is one of those terms dedicated to the latest generation thinking that they are unique or cool for coming up with something new. Guess what 'time out generation?' It's not, nor does it make you 'cool'. Ghostrider was a 'take-off' on the comic book yet the people complaining about the movie are the same ones who wrote that the 'Transformers crap-a-thon' was the greatest thing since sliced bread when that was the biggest pile of CG garbage to hit the screen and was pathetically linked to the iconic era of the 80's series cartoon. As someone who has been a fan of Ghostrider (no, not some snot nosed punk who picked up one issue after his mommy paid for his blackbelt at the YMCA) I can honestly say that although very different and somewhat 'campy' compared to the comic, this was an enjoyable version of the concept and if you watch the extras you can appreciate the effort and time put into the movie by the entire staff to make something visually fun. It's about entertainment value people. I'm sure there are a lot of people who enjoyed the 'Transformers' movie. I'll let that go and not post on their site or try to impose my opinion there. How about we do the same for this film and vent your 'emo' crap somewhere else where others of you worthless emo-gen can gather and enjoy the stupidity of mac computers at your local coffee house?",9,4,7,4 August 2007
Transformers," Beyond bad
","First off, the movie focuses on humans which are very secondary to the story compared to the robot. It's called the 'Transformers', not the winer BS problems of humans. Also, all the people writing about it and claiming that since they are in their 20's are inherently connected or knowledge worthy of said cartoon franchise are full of it. In a society filled with lazy 'time out' generation parents and kids who have to have special 'playclothes' for playing outside that they can't get dirty, yes the Transformers might seem a good movie. In the past when I have done critic writings for newspapers I have often stated 'as long as it entertains me'. This is not the case with this piece of garbage that Michael Bay has puked out. This is not entertaining, it is frustrating. Some of the worst dialog I have ever heard and seriously corrupt versions of iconic characters spew out in over 2 hours of CG/live action dullness. As stated, the serious dim-wits and people who can't handle life without a cellphone stuck to their ear will get this movie and like it as they are rarely asked to look beyond the internet for information or (god forbid) made to play outside with toys. This movie represents a farce and an insult to those of us who (actually) grew up watching this cartoon and having fun with the toys. Even if you can't comprehend life before the home computer, time-out Christian mother punishment, ipods, or the damn cellphone that can do everything, at least understand that this movie is just plain bad and an insult and that you would spend your time better trying to get the episodes of the original cartoon off of the internet.",1,22,46,7 July 2007
