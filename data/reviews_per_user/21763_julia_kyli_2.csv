The Lobster," This film is not about true love. It is about seeking life companionship
","This film looks at social pressure under extreme light- 'A person cannot possibly live their life alone.' Under these circumstances people lie, cheat, break their noses to appear to match with another just so they don't have to be alone. 'Which is worse- turning into an animal and be killed at any minute? Or have a nosebleed every once in a while' But a relationship based on a lie can make you forget the things you hold dear.On the other extreme is to declare complete independence. Self sufficient to a point of digging your own grave. 'We only dance alone- that is why we only listen to electronic music' But in that world full of denials, one cannot find true happiness.Will there ever be two equal halves that are perfect for each other? Even if there is it might not be the same way forever. Will you change yourself the way your partner has changed so you can be on the same page? So what if you don't? Will that make you untrue to the relationship? The ending being not too revealing- either way I think is too brutal to see. I am glad it ended there. Beautiful beautiful film.",9,2,4,26 May 2016
Nightcrawler," News? Storytelling? Or entertainment?
","From the very beginning we understand that Lou has no moral standards. He sees what he wants and he doesn't let go of his prey no matter what it takes. From mugging the guard's watch to manipulating the scene of crime so that he gets a juicy angle. He says all his beliefs with so much conviction that it gives you the chills. This film reminds me of the tragic murder of the news anchor Alison Parker where the shooter posted the whole killing on twitter and face book in the US in summer 2015.Night-crawler is a wake up call to how much manipulation there is in today's social media and the worst thing of all is how much the public is hungry for it, the more brutal the better.",7,0,0,26 May 2016
