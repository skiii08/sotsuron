Men in Black 3," Outstanding movie! This is so Genuinely FUNNY!
",Genuinely funny means you don't have to think about or anticipate or expect to laugh as you watch a comical title like this. It is just so hilariously funny with lots of substance and you will most definitely enjoy it like so many others and I have. It is much better either of the last Men in Black. Best watch in 3D as there is lots of action and lots of scenes where outstanding use of 3D technology is presented. There is lots of situations where the characters have to just be themselves and it blends in with the whole plot very well. The transition in the old and young agent K was amazing. There was so much thought put into the detail involved with making these two pre and post characters a delight to compare and contrast. I guarantee you will like it :),10,1,5,2 June 2012
