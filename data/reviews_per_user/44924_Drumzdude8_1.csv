The New World," Waste of 135 min.
","If god were to punish Humanity by forcing them to watch a movie in repetition until their eyes bled, this would be the movie he would show.Half the movie was shots of nature..yes they were beautiful shots..but it was boring...and almost no music made the movie theater erie...and every few min. it faded to black...and also the editing is very cutty....i didn't enjoy it u old people might think me of a hoodlum",1,3,12,28 January 2006
