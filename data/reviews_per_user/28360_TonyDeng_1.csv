Insidious: Chapter 2," Brilliantly directed , extremely satisfying sequel to the first fantastic movie.
","I was not ready for this sequel. I thought this is going to be bad or lacking in scares and suspense, after the release of 'The Conjuring'. Well, i was entirely wrong. Right from the very start, my eyes were frozen to the screen. I can't take my eyes off of it.The story continues directly from the first one, with a little flashback about Josh Lambert. There's something wrong after the events occurred in the first movie proceeded. It's not finished yet with the family. I really cannot spoil the plot because you will have to see it for yourself, and experience it.There's so much element that's better than the first. Technically, it is very crafty. You won't suspect it coming. When some of the situation went over-the-top, there's more comic relief to cool down the tension. But, over-the-top never mean it's laughable. The tension it got was very unnerving and got under my skin. I don't get easily scared at horror movies. Yet, I screamed involuntarily.This is what a horror movie should be like. James Wan has a talent for directing. It never feels derivative or predictable. You just have to hang on with the ride. Horror geeks will love this movie. It's what a sequel should be, and it is a total blast.Insidious 3 (2015)",10,1,2,24 April 2014
