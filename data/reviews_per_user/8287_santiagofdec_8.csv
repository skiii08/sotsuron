Ford v Ferrari," The kind of film we've been missing
","Big, well crafted, exciting, meaningful... Every element in the film works beautifully, sound editing, cinematography, acting, costume, etc. Makes for such a fun an engaging film and it also holds truth and insight into the human condition and doesn't treat you like a child. A grown up, direct and well told story, made me nostalgic even for the old-Hollywood classics when directors where humble and made sure to stay out of the way in service of the story. I'll have this one on bluray for sure.",10,3,4,3 December 2019
War Dogs," An incredible story, beautifully shot, but short of originality.
","For the sake of showcasing how f'ed-up the national defense budget really is, this film certainly does the job and it definitely deserves a viewing but how close can you get to Wolf of Wall Street without looking like it's little brother? It has a great soundtrack, Lawrence Sher is a master pro and Todd Phillips never disappoints to entertain an audience. It's a great thrill ride and a buddy film demonstrating how greed will do you in if you subcome to a bite of the apple.",8,0,1,2 January 2020
Knives Out," The kind of film we needed to balance out the negativity
","It's a clever who-done-it in the style of Sleuth, Clue and Family Plot and it reminds us that Hollywood entertainment can be more than just fast food. It keeps you guessing and thoroughly entertained, but what's remarkable about it is that the underlying thought is carried out in a final emotional way saying 'doing the right thing is what keeps us sane and human.'",10,2,6,9 January 2020
The Irishman," Just a privilege to be enjoyed and to be thankfull for.
",America's premiere director making cutting edge film that comprises a lifetime in so many ways. One of Scorsese's most touching films it is a milestone in cinema. It's really a gift for a cineohile to have this film now and forever. It will br one for the history books and will live through many repeated viewings. Got to be thankful to have Marty Scorsese,10,5,12,28 November 2019
1917," visceral, cinematic, emotion but the trailer is a giant spoiler
","One word 'emotion.' I think this movie is so amazing beyond its technical achievement because it manages to ignite real feelings for the characters and the events not only in a one level sense of suspense and action but mostly in terms of the human beings and the tragedy that is war. There really is much to say here but one thing I was very disappointed about was its marketing techniques... I understand this made a lot of money and the way they promoted it was obviously of help, but as a filmgoer It really sucks to have the climax of the movie and probably what would be the most exciting moment of the film in the Trailer, really took a lot from that moment.",10,0,3,18 January 2020
Joker," One of the most important films of the century
","A masterpiece in every aspect of it's filmmaking it is an essential film for anyone living in the world today. It somewhat amazes me that some critics have shut their eyes to the immeasurable achievement that this film is but I can see how one would want to outlook the very dark and dangerous times we are approaching. Be kind to your neighbor, there's only so much that the little guys will take before they blow up in your face.",10,2,5,2 January 2020
Parasite," Mind-blowing edge of your seat storytelling
","Such a precise way of unfolding a story, every frame is captivating. Tells the story of social divide in a truly masterful metaphorical thriller with such craft that you can't take your eyes off any single character. Altogether a hitchcokian tale that keeps surprising you with every scene until it's inevitable and explosive third act. I'm in awe of this film.",10,15,23,3 January 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Deluted history through a blender of political correct ideology, misses all its opportunities and punctuates it's faults
","While I was looking forward to it I am thoroughly disappointed and even kind of disgusted. A few cheeky and o. k. jokes, a clear Wes Anderson influence gone wrong, an attempt to use classic rock to elevate it and a metaphor of indoctrination that would attempt to justify it as some kind of heartfelt effort but in the end everything that is wrong about liberals this day and age... The actual history of child use in Nazi Germany is a horror, inhuman, beyond what people think anyone could be capeble of, a real insight into the terror humans can achieve and it really happened... Hitler Youth was not some sort of American Eagle Scout camp where it's members lived in happy 21st century, middle-class, political correct kinds of homes. In its attempt Jojo Rabbit actually sanitizes the worse of truth and while I came in wanting to like it because I'm a sucker for satire and comedies, I ended up wondering what the hell is wrong with Hollywood's liberal culture? patronizing, boiled down, censored, cowardly, self-confused, sluggish, uninformed... I know that not all movies should be Tarkovsky but watch Ivan's Childhood, Rossellini's Germany Year Zero, Elem Kilmov's Come and See ... if you have a thesis don't take it half way, go the entire distance and don't pretend the film is something it's not... this is not even close to Strangelove, To Be or Not to Be, The Great Dictator, Stalag 17.",4,22,51,5 February 2020
