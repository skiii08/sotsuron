Blade Runner 2049," Stunning visuals, painfully boring script
","Denis Villeneuve's slow-paced filmmaking does a service to the narrative only when the story advances rapidly. He functions as a marvelous counterpoint when conflicts and character-development escalate. Sadly, this was not the case at all. Forget about the film's predecessor. As a stand-alone, this was excruciatingly boring.Sunning visuals, though.",4,3,7,15 October 2017
Dunkirk," Everything is AMAZING... but what happened to the script?
","Incredible cinematography, amazing camera work, mind blowing action sequences and impeccable production design, music and sound.But I just walked out of the movie theater and for the life of me, I can't remember a single character's name... that ought to tell you something about the script, right? Was there even a protagonist? Anyways... next flick please, Mister Nolan.",7,3,8,29 July 2017
Black Panther," A refreshing script in the Comic Character world
","It's now been a while since I actually enjoyed watching a superhero flick at the movie theater. Don't get me wrong, I used to LOVE superhero films, but ever since the formula worked so well (money wise) for the studios, the scripts have unfortunately lost all meaning. Thank God, this is not the case for Black Panther.
Although the film does start somewhat as a low-paced, vfx plastered (specially in the fictitious world of Wakanda), clich√© adventure film, if you can power through the first 10 to 15 minutes or so, you're gonna be in for a treat.
What I loved most about Black Panther is the fact that each and every important character in the story has a well shaped backstory, they all have clear motivations for their actions, and the melodrama of the family relationships works perfectly, because it gives all of the main characters a conflict that is much needed in these types of films, and as we move forward, the plot thickens, and the stakes rise. All in all, a well written film with marvelous performances (even in small roles, as Sterling K. Brown shows us).
The script finishes off with a much needed message that envelops the whole point of the film: '...in times of crisis, the wise build bridges, while the foolish build barriers.' The relevance of this film shoots up to the sky, when the theme is so intertwined with what's going on in the world right now. And the fact that the screenwriters managed to write in a message like this, in the context and with the studio pressures that come with a blockbuster type of film like this one, is something to stand up and clap about, if you ask me.
I can only hope that the sequel to this film does the first one justice, and I can almost be sure it won't, but oh well... that's Hollywood.",8,1,3,9 April 2018
Mother!," A controversial masterpiece doomed to be under-appreciated
","Aronofsky's always been dark. There's no doubt about it. I think his 'lighter' film would be 'The Fountain', but if you think about 'Requiem for a Dream', 'The Wrestler', 'Black Swan' or even 'Pi'... the tone of this new film shouldn't really come as a surprise to anyone.Yes, it is true that this film is the darkest one, specially because of the graphic violence of the third act, but that didn't spoil the film for me.I think as viewers, we're supposed to engage with films, but also distance ourselves from them far enough to appreciate their value. I cannot sit here and tell you that I ENJOYED the film, because that would be a lie, or it would make me mentally unstable. I did enjoy the first two acts of the film, the deliciousness of the slow-burn psychological thriller that constitutes the first two thirds of the story. But I can't grasp a person who could say they enjoyed the third act, because it is there to be appreciated, to send a brutal message, 'like a missile into a wall' (in the director's words), but it's not there to be enjoyed, I don't think.In any case, a film that is capable of making you squirm in your chair, and feel physically ill while watching it, is something special. Simply because it is not an easy task to achieve that visceral reaction in an audience, and it is even harder to do it with meaning, with a purpose. As Harvey Weinstein said in an interview while talking about 'Nosferatu': 'it is too scary to look at, but too fascinating to look away from.' (Actually the cinema I watched 'mother!' at was full, and lots of people were complaining out-loud during the screening about how bad the film was, but NOT ONE OF THEM walked out of the theater before the ending... just something to think about.)Aronofsky asks as much of his audience, as we ask of our filmmakers. I'm not talking about the audience that wants to be entertained without having to think or question themselves, I'm talking about a mature audience, the ones that challenge themselves to think outside the box, to be better than the average person who sits numbingly waiting to be entertained like a dictator would ask of a buffoon. This audience, who is constantly begging for better content, for bolder narratives, and directors who take risks, is the audience who should not only appreciate this film, but has the responsibility to at least analyze it long enough to give it the valued criticism it deserves from us.We, as an audience, are equally responsible for the risks the filmmakers take, and for the quality of their work. If we restrain ourselves from appreciating a work of art, simply because it made us feel uncomfortable, we do not deserve the level of storytelling this helmer is offering us.When you watch this film (if you haven't already, or even if you're watching it again), think not of how disgusting it is to experience the difficult and violent scenes, but rather think about what they mean in the context of the story, what they mean to the characters in the story, and maybe you'll get to appreciate it in the level it deserves to be appreciated.After you do, ask yourself (as I did a day after I watched it for the first time): did I enjoy this? (Hell no!). Do I think it's a good film? (An absolute gem.)",9,3,13,5 October 2017
Green Book," A great film in its entierty
","Forget about analyzing a film in sections, talking about its cinematography or the production design, or the choices the director made to work with actors that may or may not have acted before. 2018 was cluttered with talks about films that pure and simply did not have compelling stories but somehow made it to the festival headlines. Thankfully, this was NOT this type of film. The fact that Green Book is able to cohesively tell a heart-warming tale of two men from different ethnicities who become friends in the early sixties USA, and somehow get the attention of even the most cynical of centennials, is an unbelievable achievement in itself. Add the fact that the script was inspired by true events, written by Frank Vallelonga's son, and that the director of 'There's Something About Mary' was the astonishingly best choice to take this ship to sale, and you got something special. The film is funny, witty, controversial, and simply put: beautiful. And how about that Viggo Mortensen? The guy can go from Sigmund Freud to a hippie living in the wilderness to an Italian garbage truck driver in a split second, and you believe every word that comes out of his mouth. He deserved the Oscar for this in my book.",10,0,3,13 March 2019
