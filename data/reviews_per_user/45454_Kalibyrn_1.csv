Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Preconceptions may ruin your enjoyment of this movie
","This movie is definitely a great movie.  However, to live up to the hype that has surrounded it is impossible.  For Star Wars fans, it is important to understand that going in the theatre with a preconception of what the movie will be like may be disappointing.  If you are open and willing to watch a movie that challenges your ideas about 'the force' and other things, then you will probably love this movie.As a stand-alone movie, it is a great movie. Compared to the original Star Wars films it is...  different. As part of the whole, it is wonderfully satisfying.",9,0,0,22 May 1999
