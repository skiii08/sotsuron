The Avengers," Gripping with a hint of humor
","In the beginning of the film I was a little bored. It progressed very slowly, and I feel like all marvel films are a little slow to begin with. Overall the movie was very entertaining and during the climax I was evidently at the edge of my seat. Truthfully I think the storyline was a little plain though. 'Bad guy is the not the of the good guy' kinda thing, with minions who fight for him.The cast, as always amazing, I love all their characters. My least favorite is probably the arrow dude, I can't even remember his name but some of his moves were pretty awesome. My favorite has to be scarlet Johanssons black widow. She is just such a strong woman and a true idol.",7,0,0,19 January 2020
Up," Brilliant, funny and beautiful
","I really enjoyed this film, it was a wonderful and creative Story. The images and music was perfect and I almost cried during the montage of Ellie and Carl's marriage in the beginning, it was almost like an award winning short film within the award winning film. It made me quite emotional when Carl kept his word completely to Ellie and flew him to paradise falls!!!
Throughout the film there were moments where I found russel quite infuriating, whether it was things he said or things he did. (Especially the part where he gave Kevin's cover away!) but nonetheless he was a good energy and character, and the film just wouldnt has been the same without him. It's a great family 'Saturday night' film and I look forward to watching it again in the future.",9,0,0,15 February 2020
