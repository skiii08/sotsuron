Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," My wife is dead! High 5!
","This is definitely a 10 out of 10 film. I liked it so much I had to comment.I saw an advanced screening of this last night and 90 odd minutes have never flown by so fast. As mentioned in the other comments you can't say too much with out spoiling some of the jokes, and what jokes, but it is non-stop laughter.I was worried before hand that the film would have no longevity; much like Ali G Da Movie, but after 5 minutes I need not have worried.As for the Kazakstans thinking it shows them in a bad light they couldn't be further from the truth. If anything this film shows (some) Americans in a bad light. The reactions Borat gets from the New Yorkers at the start are surprising, I can't ever imagine that reaction from people in London, unless it was late at night after a few beers, but I digress.Brilliant, clever, witty, subtle, amusing, if only I could think of more adjectives to describe it. I thought nothing could beat Team America for belly aching laughs and then I saw a man do a dirt in front of Trump towers.In one word, AWESOME!",10,5,25,28 September 2006
