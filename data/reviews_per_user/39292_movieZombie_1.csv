The Ring," great film!
","ok, so i haven't seen the 'original'....but this is one fine crafted film.  i don't think i've ever seen urban legend so very well portrayed onthe screen.   i'd go so far as to say this is a don't miss film. 
although this is not the scariest film i've ever seen, i certainly didget goose bumps a couple of times.  additionally, i enjoyed thisfilm because the lead character is a very strong female. 
i'd suggest going to this film without having read too much about it. don't spoil it for yourself.  just go and enjoy the ride!",Null,0,0,23 October 2002
