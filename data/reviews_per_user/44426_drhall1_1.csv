Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Lights - Camera - 'Tarant-Action'!
","I was not happy walking out of KB1 ... great fighting, I am a sword person too, but, enough already. (I was told there is a sequal coming ...)WOW KB2 ... what a very cool movie ... it now is a real movie landmark of storytelling, balance of flashback and action scenes, plus a genius editing job makes it a super hit for Mr. Tarantino! (QT is the director most would aspire to become.)Perfect closeups, believeable (this time)script and TarantAction scene development!This movie is in a class by itself ... The actors are dead on perfect .... ten star rating here.",10,0,1,23 April 2004
