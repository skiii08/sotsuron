The Blair Witch Project," What a waste of celluloid, pass the coffee
","I went to see this movie hoping it would live up to the hype it has received by reviewers and consumers for the last several weeks.  I was hoping it would actually have scenes that made me jump off the edge of my seat and feel the 'fear' that these people experienced.  Unfortunately, the movie turned out to be a total waste of $6.50.  I could barely stay awake to watch this amateur piece of 'filmmaking'.  I found it very uneven with very average acting.  With the poor acting and character development, it was really hard to give a darn about these character's sad fate.  And worst of all, there was absolutely nothing, and I mean nothing in this film that I found scary at all (ooooh, she hears a sound in the woods, boy that's frightening).  I kept waiting for the film to get going and it never happened.  Only the abrupt ending offered any kind of 'horror'.  Overall, I found this to be one of the most over-hyped, over-rated films in movie history and it should have stayed where it belongs: in the woods under a pile of dirt, dung, and leaves.",Null,0,1,20 August 1999
