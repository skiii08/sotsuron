Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," wow, amazing, funniest most offensive movie i have ever seen
","seriously i could not see how someone couldn't find this film funny. well unless they are as stupid as the people borat deals with in the movie. i have been a borat/ali g/ bruno fan for a while now and i thought i knew what i was getting myself into when i went to see this last night. it was even more than i expected, completely stunning piece of comedy. i never laughed so hard so much ever in my life. definitely never laughed that hard at any other movie. i had to drive an hour to see this cuz in my state(maine) it is only showing in 3 theaters opening weekend, but the drive was WELL worth it. i used to say how sasha baron cohen was 'crazy/insaine' and after seeing this movie no words can now describe him. genius is maybe the only one. i doubt anyone read this because i say nothing about the film in it really but i did that on purpose cuz i couldn't bare to give anything away. borat great success.",10,1,14,4 November 2006
Nacho Libre," some classic JB moments, and Jared Hess Moments
","Well now we know what j. hess's style of a flick is. As there were many differences between nacho and napoleon there were a few things here and there that seemed fimlilliar. I thought the movies was pretty damn funny. Its all about the delivery of the lines. If any one else were casted as Nacho this movie would of been horrible. But its like they have JB a sweet stache, pimpin hair and said 'talk with a Mexican accent' then rolled the cameras which equals laughs for me. Also there were really random things in the movie that weren't even explained in the plot which i thought was really funny. But pretty much its allllll about Jack blacks performance, its gold. Also when he sings, it rocks some socks.",8,4,9,16 June 2006
V for Vendetta," wow, very impressed i just don't know what else to say...
","SO I just came back from a special viewing of this movie (started at 10pm on the 16th) and I was personally blown away. The W. Bros have done it again. Created an awesome script with everything and makes you think. Yes it based on a comic, sorry 'graphic novel' but this is by far my FAV. movie based on a comic. Not going to get to wordy, visuals were awesome, action scenes awesome, the theme VERY relevant and appropriate. I have read a few of the novels and i think the movie stacks up very well to it. When i walked out of the theater a bunch of 35 year old bum comic geeks were already huddled together exchanging words and one said 'it seems like in the comic V comes across as more scary and in this more of a old gay theater guy' *insert lame i haven't gotten laid in years laugh here*. This is Hollywood people. If they did the movies EXACTLY like the comics, the movie wouldn't of even been made. Anyway GO SEE THIS MOVIE! Best $7 i spent in a long time. I am deff. going to go see this again and that coming from me is a rare thing.",10,2,5,16 March 2006
