The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," God awful
","This doesn't even cover the 50 pages of the third book.Makes no sense why would they even consider making this movie.The effects were great,acting is mediocre but the story is pure garbage.SPOILERS AHEADIn the other 250 pages of the book they invade the city and battle goo and,you guessed it,dinosaurs.Some major characters die and it's pure pandemonium.So it confuses me why would they make a boring movie just to top it off with something amazing.Too keep it short,don't watch this movie,you will read the book parts this movie was based upon faster than watching this",3,3,4,20 August 2015
