Requiem for a Dream," Absurdly Powerful
","This movie was the most powerful film I have ever seen -- and I didn't even see the beginning. DirecTV gave it this description, and this is the only reason I watched 'it:  4 people try to better their lives'.  Absurd! So I kept waiting for their lives to get better and needless to say they got worse and worse until it was too depressing to stand. I kept turning it off but then would turn it back on.  Anyway, I'm glad I saw it because it made me have more compassion. The next time I see a 'wacko' on the subway, I will think of that marvelousacting by Ellen  Burstyn, and realize that the 'wacko' is someone's mother.  Also, it was heart-breaking to see the young people with so much potential and beauty spiral down into utter hopelessness and sqaulor.  I guess I'm glad DirecTV blew the description of the movie because I would never have watched it.  The filming was marvelous.",Null,0,1,8 December 2003
