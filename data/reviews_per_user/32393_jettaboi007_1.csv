Marie Antoinette," Marie Antoinette is Awesome!
","I thought the movie was quite good. The only thing that I have to say I was disappointed in was the ending. Though they left her (and him) with their dignity. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed it. The images, plots, details were awesome! I thought, unlike some, that the music was very fitting. The converse tennis shoes were a nice touch! Though there were some things in there that I have found weren't historically accurate. Such as her wanting to stay at the palace with her husband, etc. The reason that I am writing is because I am going to a costume ball, as Marie, and I am having no luck at finding a hoop pannier, like the one she first put on, with the blue dress. If anyone out there has any information let me know!! Thank you!",8,1,4,3 November 2006
