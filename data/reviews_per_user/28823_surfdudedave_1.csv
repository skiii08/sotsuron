50 First Dates," Good date movie
","Adam has made a great movie to take a date to see. For guys, the gross out humor and for the ladies, the sweet love story. Many critics are knocking this film, but they fail to understand that this is a sweet sappy film with Adam Sandler humor tie in. True, it's not like The Wedding Singer because this film has many more serious moments and issues to deal with, but it still has the same Adam Sandler qualities that we all love.",8,0,0,17 February 2004
