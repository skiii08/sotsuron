Casablanca," The best film ever made?
","Flawless acting, superb direction, atmospheric camera work and a script that is well written and interesting. This film has everything.Made nearly 60 years ago, it has lost nothing of its tension and if you are the sort who looks for messages in films, this one has loads.Most of all it is enjoyable. Even on the TV it is brilliant, but do try to get to see it on the big screen.",10,1,1,17 January 2000
Monty Python's Life of Brian," One of the funniest movies ever made
","Quite simply one of the funniest movies ever made.It still amazes me how people get upset about its content, as only the zealously stupid could be offended. There are too many funny moments, and I guess its mid ranking in this sites list of all time favourites has something to do with the British schoolboy humour that is only truly accessible to us ex British schoolboys.Anyone who has done Latin will enjoy John Cleese as the Centurion/Latin teacher, and  other delicious moments such as the silent hermit must not be missed.The cartoon sequence could be got rid of but it was in good monty python tradition.When this film was released in the UK I remember seeing a short before it with a John Cleese voice over, describing Venice. Never seen it since, but it was an amazingly funny parody of a travel film. Has anyone got a copy?",10,1,3,21 September 1999
