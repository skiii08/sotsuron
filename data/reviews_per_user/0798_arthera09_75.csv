Vertigo," everything one would expect from Hitchcock
","The only reason I do not give this movie a 10 is kind of the same reason why I did not give the graduate a 10. It is because the love story felt totally uninspired. Maybe they also kissed differently back then, but when Scotty kisses Judy when she dresses up like Madaline again it does not seem very passionate. Other than that the movie was amazing. I don't think I have seen the lighting trick in any other movie used as effectively as in this movie. When Scotty is learning about the history of Carlotta and the scene just gets dark is a great scene. Somehow the story seems like a standard affair in terms of plots for modern movies, but Hitchcock manages to make it an edge of your seat thriller. Jimmy Stewart did an amazing job as allows and the end it seems as if he just may have it in him to kill Judy. He manages to shed his nice guy persona and is downright scary. There is nothing better than watching a classic film and seeing where the greats get their motivation for making great movies. I have to say that I did love the dream sequence and the look in his face is possibly one of the best reaction shots to a dream. I do not know why movies are just not better written now a days. There was some quick dialog that you do not get in movies like this. It is hard to imagine not falling in love the type of characters that Jimmy Stewart portrays because they just don't make actors like him anymore. If you gave him the lines all you needed to do was put a camera on him. I also liked how they did not show what happened after Judy killed herself because I would like to think of him falling back into despair, but the fact that it is left up to the viewer shows a level of respect to the viewer that one does not see anymore. Jimmy Stewarts up and downs in the movie could not have been done better and seeing him in his most pathetic is really a testament of how good of an actor he is. Overall great movie and it is great to watch the masters at work doing what they do best.",9,5,6,23 February 2008
Se7en," Excellent entry into the genre of crime dramas
","This is a fantastic movie and I cannot really find anything wrong with it, but in the end it is just a crime drama. The one thing that sets it apart from the rest of the crime dramas is the excellent cast and one of the bleakest ending ever caught on film. Fincher really did do a fantastic job of putting together a well-paced and surprisingly thought provoking movie. Morgan Freeman is the constant in the movie that never allows the viewer to lose hope that the situation is not hopeless, while keeping the viewer cynical enough to make the city that they live in a land of misguided hopeless souls. Freeman has such brevity that is really just amazing to watch him. Pitt on the other hand does a very respectful job of being the young cop with ambitions of saving the world and has places well across from the jaded Freeman. Spacey of course played his character spot on and when he gives himself on is probably the creepiest thing in the movie because at this point you have no idea what he is up to, but you know that is is in total control of the situation. I love how Fincher choose to keep the city raining and lit most of the scenes to emphasize the dark. This matched the darkness nature of the film perfectly. The fact that the last scenes was in the bright day light just made it that more shocking. One can tell that a lot of care when into presenting the world to the viewer in a way that matched the themes perfectly.I think that car ride provided a great forum for us to get to know John Doe even though we only spend a few minutes we seems to know him so well. One can see Mills going down hill and is losing his footing on the moral high ground. It is extremely well played and I love how Summerset comes off as being a match for him. In a way I see Summerset and Doe as being similar, with the main difference of Doe being crazy. I think this is an extremely well done and smart entry of crime dramas that really flips some of the conventions in a way that can be surprising. The fact that they do not catch the killer, but the killer turns himself in and that fact that the cops lose. They do not save anyone's lives and they fall into the trap that Doe set up for them. I very much enjoyed this film and it was paced and put together in a very effective way.",9,2,3,4 June 2011
Star Trek," impressed
","I will preface this review with the fat that I hate Star Trek and the universe it has created. This has to do with my upbringing and my love of the cerebral type of science fiction and not the pop corn fare that Star Trek seems to normally encompass. This movie was a one word 'fun'. There were great action set pieces and was sharply written. The movie never meandered and kept my attention for the entire movie and help up to criticism during the viewing. I will usually watch a movie trying to keep my eyes open for things to criticize, and things to praise, but his movie I was just caught up too much in the whole experience that I missed a lot of that. The cast I guess made this movie. With a lesser cast this would have just been some good story telling, but the cast made set this movie more than just popcorn fun. I loved Simon Pegg and wish he could have gotten more screen time. I guess the one downfall that this movie had is the same downfall most action movies have with me and that is the use of crappy editing and shaky cameras during close quarters action scenes. Be it the hand to hand combat on the drill or the phaser shoot out on the mining ship directors need to learn to make these scenes work. This is just a personal gripe that I have, but I also suck so no one should put that much thought into this criticism. Good times.",9,2,7,31 December 2009
Coraline," wow
","I must say this was one of the most visually stunning film that I do not think will ever be matched again, unless Henry Selick decides to do more claymation in 3D. I am really excited about this 3D revolution and what it can mean for movies, but there will be enough movies where it is just a gimmick, but this film it is wonderfully implemented and possibly claymation is the perfect medium for 3D. The world actually felt like I should be able to reach out and touch it. I completely forgot almost immediately that this was stop motion and that it was in 3D at all. I really was emerged into the world completely. The score was fantastic and the voice acting was as good as it needed to be. The best part was that we have a visually stunning film combined with a top notch story. I really enjoy how Neil Gaiman does not try to make a fluffy kids film, but made a kid's film that taps into the fears of a child and creates a world, that seems as if I might have created as a child. The story is a kids story, without doubt. But adults can love the story in the same way that any adult loves playing with a child within the limitations of the kids imagination. I cannot express my love of this movie anymore, but I must insist that this is seen in 3D. I hope 3D does not just turn into a way of showing off latest technology, but a tool a good director can use to help immerse the viewer into the world. I also have to note that I saw this movie with really high expectations and all of them were surpassed. A quick word about the viewing experience. I probably the last 3D showing in the Albany area and it was at 10:30 or so at night so I was literally the only one in the theater. So basically everything about the experience was magical. To throw one quick criticism out there I wished there were more than just a few hints at the mysterious connection of the real world with the other world.",10,0,3,10 April 2009
Iron Man 2," Too busy
","Everything about this movie was enjoyable, but they just tried to pack too much into one movie. Any one thing in the movie did not receive enough attention and the movie lacked because of it. The special effects were good and the action sequences were fun. The acting was as expected and Mickey Rourke stole the camera. Don Cheadle worked, but there was no common thread that held the movie together. They attempted to tackle way too many topics. I have given worst movies the same score, but this movie never came together for me. I am honestly just excited for Avengers movie. Everything else is secondary until that movies comes out. I enjoyed the movie, but I would have a hard time recommending it to anyone. This is the type of movie that I would watch if it was on TV, but I do not think I would ever sit down and watch it again.",7,0,1,18 May 2010
12 Monkeys," story vs artistic vision
","This is the type of movie that suffers from a clash of imagination and story telling. At the heart of this movie is an interesting take on time travel that suffers from the fact that the director's vision drew from the simplicity and elegance of the story. I want to love Gilliam, but it is not an easy task. The story is a fairly simple tale of time travel that ends with a sufficient number of twists and turns to make it interesting and to keep the audience guessing. The execution of that story on the other hand left me unsatisfied. There were certain aspects of the movie and specifically themes that I wish the director emphasized more. The idea that Cole could have been crazy and that everything was just in his head was barely touched upon and when it was it seemed like it was tacked on. I thought that one of the main ideas was that Cole could not change the past and that we would be forced to live the nightmare over and over again was not emphasized enough. Instead of making sure that the themes emerged it seems that Gilliam decided to focus on more visually inventive aspects of the movie. I did enjoy the design of the future, but it was too stylized for it to fit the rest of the story. The present wasn't overly stylized so it did not seem like the future fit into the same universe as the present.The acting was really good and I really enjoyed watching Brad Pitt play against type. Willis was good, but there was nothing special. Stowe on the other hand I thought was perfect. She was sympathetic all the while being strong willed. There is a beauty that radiates from her eyes and I would to see her some more dramatic roles. There are some strong points for this movie and it was definitely a Gilliam film. I do not think he had to compromise his artistic vision too much, which I believe hurt the movie. I do love time travel movies, but there was not a lot of connections of the present to the future, which took away from the fact that it was a time travel movie.",7,0,2,4 June 2011
Shaun of the Dead," good movie with some surprising feeling at the end
","I have to say that this was an excellent zombie film. The biggest problem I have with most zombie movies is that everyone in them is just a cliché, but this movie manages to give each character a pretty well developed entity to work with. Simon Pegg's character is the most rounded and I have to say very well acted. I felt as if I were attacked by zombies this is basically how I would act. The scenes where brevity was needed it was actually well done and that is because the characters were real. When Simon shoots his mother is a surprisingly moving scene. The standoff where funny is actually pretty heart felt. In most movies where a lot of people are going to die I don't care who lives or dies, but I actually cared with Simon Pegg dies nor not. For a while there I thought he was actually going to die, but the ending was good. I think the movie may have been a little more moving if they did actually die, or just leave them going up the elevator. Nick's and Simon's relationship was very well done and Simon's relationships with just about anyone were pretty well rounded. That are not that many times that I mention the special features, but I must say that I loved the plot holes part. It was very funny and it added to the whole attitude that the movie makers took to this movie. This zombie movie succeeds where a lot of other films failed, but putting real people in a silly situation and making them real.",8,1,3,23 July 2007
Elizabeth," Great period piece anchored by a career defining performance by Cate Blanchett
","I remember watching Elizabeth in high school and remember how this was the first period piece that completely drew me in. I remember the costumes being the main thing that drew me in, but revisiting it as a slightly more mature adult I realize that a great period piece like this is much more than costumes. Anchored by a career defining performance by Cate Blanchett the viewer is swept into England at a time of turmoil and uncertainty and are given a unique perspective as one of the most powerful people in history comes to power.I really love how the writers chose to spend most of the movie showing Elizabeth as being human being with frailties and insecurities. I also enjoyed seeing her in love, but this ends up being the only weak point in the movie for me. It is mainly because I am cynical and do not buy into that type of undying love that Lord Robert and Elizabeth share with each other. That might just be me being cynical or that love at the time meant something complete different and I just cannot relate to it. It is probably because I am cynical. Other than this there are almost no faults with the movie.One could spend pages talking about how good Blanchett is in this, but she gives us a remarkable transformation of a doe-eyed love struck girl to one of the most powerful and formidable images of power ever caught on film. Watching her psyching her self up in the mirror and then go out in Parliament and getting what she wanted was a fantastic one-two combination that really captures the transition that Elizabeth had to go through to become the leader of an entire country. Together with an impressive supporting cast we get to see Attenborough play a role that he almost always seems to play, but plays it so well. He plays a man with nothing but good intentions in his heart while being misguided at times. Eccleston does a fantastic job of being a villain while doing almost nothing villainous. We honestly believe that he is doing everything for the good of his country, while never losing his villainous streak. Rush does a good job as her mysterious adviser and at the end I love how his intentions are made clear, but you are still not sure if you should trust him. I also loved seeing Cassel playing a character so far from what I have seen him in before. I loved picking out various actors and actress that I recognized from all over the place in small roles. One of the most impressive parts for me was the sets. I honestly could not tell you if there were actually sets or castles that they shot on. Either way they are impressive and I was truly awestruck at some massiveness of some of the sets. As mentioned before the costumes were especially effective. I loved seeing Elizabeth going from simple dresses to some of the more impressive costumes I have ever seen, while never being out of character. In the end this movie is one of the most impressive period pieces I have ever seen while at the same time being one of the most interesting character studies of a historical figure I have ever seen. With a timeless performance by Blanchett this movie is really a treat for any fan of film.",9,1,2,30 May 2011
Oldboy," expectations ruined this movie for me
","I had really high expectations for the film. I think it ruined it for me. It was a really good movie, but it never flowed for me. The tone never seemed consistent to me. It felt like it wanted to be a thriller at times, an action movie at times, and a comedy at times. I do not think it blended the three themes that well. Visually it was an extremely impressive movie. There were some shots that seemed on the verge of being truly beautiful with some cool color themes, but they always fell short. The one fight scene that the movie is famous for is really one of the most impressive fight scenes I have ever seen. It was nice mix of powerful action that really gave us a feeling of the character's desperation. The relationship between the main characters always felt forced to me and the hypnosis explanation never sat well with me. I guess it explained the reason why the relationship felt forced and out of place, but without a meaningful character relationship the movie felt hallow. I really enjoyed the build up, but the twists never shocked or surprised me. I enjoyed the acting, but nothing really stood out for me as a whole. It was a good movie, but not remarkable for me.",7,0,3,3 July 2010
Hot Fuzz," once again a funny British film
","I enjoyed this movie very much, but it being like a lot of parodies very predictable. I wish some of the references that used were blatantly pointed out as references to specific movies. It might have been more fun for me if recognized them one my own having seen a lot of those movies and made fun of them because there are so silly. I loved seeing Bill Nighy and it just supports my theory that he is in every British film that has been made in the last 5 years. Also the guy from Hitchhiker's Guide showed up briefly. The fact that everyone in the town was the enemy was a nice touch and I saw it coming, but I thought it was really funny that they killed them for the reasons that they did. The movie was just top notch, and you got to love the over the top British humor. A lot of people would not like it, but I enjoy this type of movie.",8,3,5,11 June 2007
My Neighbor Totoro," this will be a must see for any kid
","I love this movie. Miyazaki can do a movie like no other and his magic shows in any movie. I started noticing the influence WW2 had on film makes like this and I think this movie captures it in a fun childish way that does not loose it power. The character design was amazing from the girls to all of the creatures. I think that Miyazaki can pull off taking a pretty empty shot and using to keep the pace of the movie without it being obvious, but then it picks up and it just turns into a whirlwind of magic. The tragic nature of a lot of Japanese film and the way of coping with it by creating a fantastical world where dreams literally come true. I think one of the nice things at the end of the movie that no one including the parents and the audience don't believe in the magic that propels the movie. At times it is a little scary, but in a good way, but nothing horrible every really happens. The only reason this movie does not get a 10 is because when watching any Miyazaki film one inevitably compares it to his other films and I do not think this top spirited away, but has a place in every movie library.",9,1,3,16 September 2007
500 Days of Summer," what makes this movie fun, also detracts from it
","This is a good movie, but the problem is that this movie is way too personal. If you have gone through the things in the movie and know people like Tom and Summer it makes it a lot easier to buy into it. I do not think I know anyone like Tom, but I did not buy into the whole downfall. I totally bought into him falling in love and some of my favorite moments was when he was falling in love with her. When they had finally broken up I felt as if he overreacted, but a lot of people do not agree with me. Maybe that is exactly how people would react to that type of situation, but since I would not act that way and I feel as if he was just taking it really badly and needed to grow up. I love the characters in every other sense though. I thought JGL nailed some of those scenes to perfection and I loved when they were lying on the bed in Ikea and she says that she is not looking for something serious and his cheek twitches and you have a fantastic reaction shot there. Subtle in every way, but extremely telling if you noticed it. I have thought some of the exact thoughts as he did and I am one of those guys that could fall in love like that, but in the end I feel if some of it was too far reaching for me to relate to.I liked the non-linear story telling, but for me it also detracted from the movie a little bit because I was constantly reminded of Tom's reaction to being dumped. So that made the movie fun also took something away from the movie for me.I loved the little sister and how her innocence actually produced some fantastic advice. That actress is someone to watch in the future. I loved how the friends could not help him, but his sister can. I guess it is Weber's way of saying that Tom's views on love are very much like a child and very innocent.I loved the illustration part of the movie and it felt good to watch.I guess I did not really like how the movie's ending was kind of cliché and tried to sew things together nicely in the end, but I loved how Tom kept his innocence and his hope for that love. As silly as the last line was I loved it and would not change it no matter how sappy it was.The ending dragged a bit and I think it showed that Weber is a first time director, but none of this stops this from being a good movie and something I thoroughly enjoyed watching.The last thing I have to mention is I loved the dance scene and how spot on it was. The Han Solo reference could not have been better done. It made me so happy to see that.In the end the movie just did not click with me as much as it did with other people because I do not know people that would react that way nor would I react in that way even though I am like Tom in more ways than one.",8,0,3,11 August 2009
The Prestige," totally surprised
","I am not sure why this is so how on the all time list, but this was an extremely entertaining film. There is not much to say that this is an extremely entertaining film, that does everything right. With all of the twists most of which I did not see coming. I had a feeling about the twin, but not 100% percent sure. Since Cutter was a character outside of the movie I was sure he was right about the body double and that could only be achieved by his brother, but as a viewer I wanted to believe that part was magic. I just read a few arguments that people have about the movie and I try to instigate discussions at the end of movies (like I like to do with Pan's Labrynth), but I think this movie really did a good job of remember that this was just a movie and listening to Christopher Nolan's commentary on the making of the film, but tells me that the whole point of this movie was to trick the viewer into believing what we saw was real, not because we actually believe, but because we want to. I think the end with Jackman's character was unnecessary and conflicted with the character and it should have been left that Bale's character was not only the better magician, but the better human being. The performances were great especially Caine's. The accent's slipped a few times on the main characters, but still over all a great 2 hours of my life. I really was on the edge of my seat the entire time. This is one of the few movies, where the director succeeds in creating a world that as a viewer I wanted to believe in.",9,3,5,21 June 2007
Cloverfield," unlike anything i have seen before
","I loved this movie. It was one of the most intense films I have ever seen in the theater. I loved the look. It was nice to see movie do something new (even if it has been done before). The fact that this was a monster movie and that the story line was nothing new and it still felt so fresh and unlike anything I have ever seen before made this movie so enjoyable. The only reason it does not get a 10 is because of a major flaw in writing. The fact that the little clips were spliced in only would have happened if Hud fast forward every once in a while, which does not make a lot sense. Maybe he was stopping and watching what he just recorded and on his way back he went to far, but it happened at too perfect of times and too often. Also the fact that he filmed things when no sane human being would have and turned off the camera at weird times made it seem a little inconsistent. I am not sure how they did it (maybe it was with the little clips of the past), but I really got to care about the characters. The most defining moment of the movie was when the mom called. I really felt it and it really made it feel like the hardest thing he had to do that night. The decision to go get Beth was easy, but answering that phone had to be the hardest thing to do. I like how we got little to no closure about what happened at the end of the movie and I almost wish that they decide to leave the movie as it is. I was excited by the hype and I was not let down at all. I might even go see this movie again in the theater. As much as the film was just another monster movie it really turned out to be a piece of art that will be remember for a long time for trying something new and succeeding.",9,1,4,31 January 2008
Once," best film I have seen all year
","I do not like giving 10's out and it is a rare movie that I do, but this was just perfect. The one criticism I might have is that the camera is too shaky sometimes, but I realized it was supposed to be that way. The music was perfect and I since I have been listening to the soundtrack for a few weeks it just made it better. The impact of the songs really hit home because I knew a lot of the lyrics and what they meant. It just made all the scene all the better. From the standpoint of a person who once wanted to be a musician this was amazing. If you have never sat around a 8-track player with a friend and created music this movie may not speak to those who have, but it still does not stop the movie from being amazing. Both of the leads were amazing and I was waiting to hear their names and I never did and I love that. From the opening scene which set the tune for the lightness of the film and the funny nature of it to the emotionally driven end that sent shivers down my back. I think the fact that the two leads are actually involved really allowed them to pull off some of the most powerful moments in the movie. The frames (that are straight from a Ingrid Bergman film) where the two faces were both in focus and the looks on their faces were priceless. Especially when it is a profile of the 'girl' and the 'guy' looking at her one could really feel the emotion. I won't even comment on the musical tag that this movie received, except that one cannot let the tag discourage anyone from seeing it. I was also impressed by the father son relationship that was really well developed in a very few short scenes that were well placed and interactions that one might have missed. The fact that the father brings in tea for everyone when they are rehearsing was a nice little touch and said a lot about the father which made their final scene together a little more special. I think the ending was perfect and I was smiling so hard and had shivers down my back. I really like those movies that keep redefining what love can mean for two different people and had music at the core of the relationship and it was perfect. I think I could keep talking about this film but I better go and review another movie.",10,8,10,16 September 2007
Snatch," funny British film
","I thought this film was very funny, but I would not say it was a great movie. I really really enjoyed it and it employed a lot very neat directing tricks. I like how some characters had their distinct camera style and it was pulled off well. Surprisingly one of the weaker performances I thought was Del Toro's, who is usually one of my favorite actors and some of the no names did extremely well. They are only no names in my book, but they may be established in English cinema. I loved some of the characters and every one of them was unique in their own way, but added a lot to it. I loved Brick Top. This maybe be sad, but after Seven and Fight Club this is the only movie that I don't hate Brad Pitt as an actor. He held his own in this movie. I loved how the movie ended and the 'good guys' getting away with the diamond. I loved the heist at the beginning and thought it was so well done. That is about it. I don't think I would watch it again, unless to get someone else to watch this. I should also mention this is my second time watching it, but I did not remember anything about it except that is was very funny.",8,1,2,11 June 2007
The Expendables," What is this crap
","I have never been so disappointed in a movie. I do not even know why I had any expectations of this being good, but I figured there would be some decent fight scenes. I was wrong. First of all the setup was terrible, but that is nothing to complain about in a movie like this. Something to complain about is that the movie felt like it was just a series of set pieces sewn together with some incomprehensible dialog. The movie made sure it gave each actor something ridiculous to do, with zero character development. For the final action sequences I could barely tell how was the good guy and who I was supposed to be cheering for. Not only because of the stupid quick cuts but also because they all looked like the same big muscled brawlers. I guess the fact that the bad guys had face paint helped a little bit, but not really. I mentioned that the dialog was incomprehensibly, but even when I could understand what they were saying I could not understand why any human being would say those words in those order. The attempt at one liners were pathetic and when you could understand them they were bad enough that I almost wanted to groan.I guess one good thing was Statham threw knives and that was kind of cool. The action scenes were not the worse I have seen, but the final one, which was supposed to be the crowning moment of the film was so choppy I had no idea where anyone was or why people were dying. I am sorry, but Rourke what were you thinking. The rest of the cast I understand what is going on, but Rourke. You have a legitimate movie career ahead of you. Why waste time on this? I could see you trying with some of the dialog, but the lines were just so bad. I do not recommend this movie to anyone except those who want to watch things blow up and do not care about anything else at all.",3,4,8,28 December 2010
Blade II," this movie really needed a villain
","What I like about the first Blade movie was Deacon Frost. I loved the character and thought he was very well executed. This movie on the other hand just did not have a satisfying bad guy. The action was not bad, and I really liked how they incorporated the wrestling moves into the fighting style. I hated how Scud turned out to be a familiar and that Blade was onto him the whole time. They should have just killed him off and left that part out. It was weak story writing and felt forced. The special effects at times looked really hokey, but I actually did think some of the shots in the final scene had a good vision, but the special effects department just did not pull it off. The fight scene where Blade beats up all those armored guards was boring after a while and I just wanted it to end. The girl was hot, but that was all she contributed. I thought there was a lot of plot potential and great character moments involving the blood pact, but they totally missed out on that. The couple in the blood pact relied on the opening scene where they are seen hugging each other. The fact that they really did not do much else with them between there and when they actually die together it was sad. By the way Wesley Snipes is just not that funny. He tried, but just could not make me feel for the character at all. The one good thing was the reapers looked amazing, but beyond that not much there. Overall the movie just did not have the script and I felt bad by Del Toro and I know he can do much better work, and if given a better script I feel as if it would have turned out better.",4,0,2,3 April 2007
Knocked Up," funny movie
","I would say that this is a very funny movie, but nothing super special. People are really starting to love Judd Apatow and I think he makes some quality movies that are very enjoyable. I think the scenes with Seth's friends were the best. They acted in a very real way and much how a bunch of random guys would act. I unfortunately did not feel for the characters as much as I could have. Heigel's character was a little flat and nothing special. Seth's character was not fully explored and I thought he had a lot of potential, but he changed out of nowhere. You can see it coming, but there was no real evident change in character except he did basic things that were not surprising. I really loved the scene with the dad. That was heart felt and that showed character growth through a very basic conversation. That relationship felt real, but I was kind of curious why the dad followed his deadbeat son to California from Canada or if it was the other way around. It was a very funny movie and I would enjoy watching it again, but it was not a great movie.",6,1,2,21 February 2008
Alien," great movie, but I think over rated
","I liked this movie a lot and the production value was some of the best I have seen from a movie that old, but I was honestly disappointed in the whole feel of the movie. The best think I would say was the production value. There was little character development and the end was kind of anti-climatic. I would have liked to have seen the alien came after Ripley and have something a bit more exciting at the end besides the final jump at her. I really enjoyed the sound effects, but were used so much better in a Space Oddessy. I know I should not be comparing the two movies, but it happens. I have to say who ever was the production designer went well above and beyond. The cinematography was surprisingly rich considering the atmosphere. The one scene with Ripley coming down the later with the flame thrower was just great. The use of the strobe was nice and gave a sense of not knowing what the danger was. Ridley Scott really did create a whole new world with a lot of atmosphere and I look forward to seeing the next one again. I did not feel the suspense as much as I could have and the set of urgency was achieved at the end with the quick editing did not seem to pace well together. Oh one of my favorite things was how some of the shots were very dark and small and I wonder how another director with the current technology would imagine some of the shots. I have to give a lot of respect to Ridley Scott for doing a lot with a little (in terms of the current state of special effects).",8,1,3,22 June 2007
Lost in Translation," I don't like giving tens but this movie deserves it
","This movie is perfect. There is not a moment in the movie that is not perfect. The soundtrack, the lighting, the acting and writing was impeccable. From the opening scene (which is just a shot of Scarlett's butt), to the passing streets as Bill Murray's character leaves. I think the tag lines and the description does not do the movie justice. This movie is not about a friendship, but about love. It gives us a good representation of the type of love out there and that there is love to be had out there between strangers that can be as powerful as any love one can feel in their lives. The moment when the two of them are in bed and Bill places his hand on Scarlett's foot is such an intimate moment and just summarizes the entire movie. This point is emphasized when Bill's character sleeps with the lounge singer and Scarlett's character gets mad. They both know that the act of sex means nothing when it comes to love, but they both cannot help letting it effect them because they care so much about each other. I love the ending and a lot of people want to know what Bill whispers in her ear, but I like that it is a secret that they will share and give a level of intimacy that one rarely sees in any movie. The movie is one of the funniest things and really shows that Bill Murray can act on so many levels. He is funny and tragic and perfect. It was this movie that made me fall in love with Scarlett have not seen her play a better character. I think she did an outstanding job and the scenes when she calls home and starts crying was very well done. The on location shooting really showed and it shows when done well it really improves the movie. I think a movie like this needed to be shot on location for the viewer and the actors to really get caught up in the moment. I could not help laughing for most of the movie and I always hate it when people say it is boring.",10,2,5,18 March 2007
The Bourne Identity," One can tell is a book adaptation, and that the book is better
","Hollywood has done a miserable job (in my opinion) of translating these types of books into movies. I grew up on Tom Clancy novels and have not felt as if any of the movies even came close to my expectations (even with Harrison Ford in them). I have not read the Bourne books but I would have to say that I felt disappointed for those who have. There were some excellent characters and character interactions just waiting to happen. Clive Owen's character had so much potential, but was just unexploited. The fight scenes were not bad and I think Matt Damon did an excellent job and Franka Potente looked great and did a decent job, but the story never came together for me, even though I could tell there was the making of a very good story. Given the first line of dialog of Jason on the ship with the captain I could tell that they were trying to put the struggle of the character in 1 minute of the movie, when it probably made a great part of the book. Granted some books make some good entertaining movies and this one was entertaining, but it felt more like watching a set of cliff notes. The story felt very rushed with little time spent on characters. I loved the location shooting and that really added to the movie. Overall not horrible movie, but nothing special.",5,2,4,3 April 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Love it
","I will not say too much about this movie, but I will say that I as a huge fan of the books this was nearly everything I could want from a movie based on the first book. Everyone, except Frodo and Arwen, was cast perfectly. The special effects, make-up, and costumes are perfect. The music, cinematography and everything was perfect. I would give it a ten, but the poor casting of Frodo really took something from it. Also there were certain things that were missing from the movie that a fan from the book would have love to have seen, but nothing that ruined the movie for me. The location shooting was breath taking and the level of devotion of the director and everyone else involved in making the movie really shows.",9,0,1,25 March 2007
28 Weeks Later," no need to make this movie
","There was no need to make this movie. Or if it was going to be made call it something else. The fact that it exists in the same world as 28 days later takes away from the world. The one intense scene was when the military personal started just shooting everyone. The rest of the movie felt forced and extremely poorly written. After the first movie I kind of a have a soft spot for running zombies, so that helped the entertainment value, but the rest of the movie was just poorly written. The subway scene was scary and the fact that everyone, but the kids died was surprising, but not all the potent in terms of story telling. I liked the fact that there was no cure in the first movie and the introduction of even the slightest bit of hope of a cure was sad to me. The point is that there is no cure for what is human nature. The way the story was pushed forward just did not feel good. It felt unnatural. There was some great direction at point and I loved the look of the women and kids eyes. That was kind of creepy for some reason. The best part of the movie was of course the helicopter tearing all of the zombies apart. That was totally bad-a$$ and probably one of the reasons this got a 6 and not a 5.",6,0,2,31 January 2008
American Psycho," not quite there
","This movie had great vision and some really good ideas, but it just did not pull it off. This movie is filled with great little moments, but as a whole it did come together. Christian Bale was brilliant and there was nothing wrong with him, but the rest of the movie was not there. The opening scene was awesome, but almost too cliché. They did explore the decent into madness very well. The violence was not over the top which was nice, but I think if they should more of the murders it would have been better in the end. Not that they needed to actually show the blood or gore, but to add show him killing people. The whole police aspect of the movie was not put together well and I did not feel at any point that he was a threat. They could have done without it or they could have expanded on it. As it stood it did not work for me. For me I don't think that there was that much confusion on the ending. I do no think he killed Jared Leto's character, but did end up killing people, but because he was crazy he was not able to keep things straight in his head. The best scene was the opening scene followed by his sex scene where he was flexing. I also loved the dialog of about the music. It felt as if it read right our a review (as it was supposed to) and just added to the fact that he was not human capable of normal human emotion. Overall not a great movie, but Christian Bale saved it from being even lower for me. There were great ideas and maybe in someone else's hands it could have been a masterpiece.",6,1,2,8 March 2008
American Beauty," perfect
","There is nothing to say about this movie except it is perfect. Every time I watch it it just gets better and better. I notice the little things that all of the actors do and every time I watch it I am convinced that Chris Cooper is one of the most under rated actors out there right now. The music was perfect, cinematography and everything was perfect. We know why Kevin Spacey is one of the best actors of all time. I would like to see what else Alan Ball is capable of and may just watch six feet under just because he in involved. I can't think of many films that brings the viewer up and down so smoothly and in such a compelling way. This will always be one of my favorite films and I would say this is one of the best films of all time (and this is not just my generational prejudice talking).",10,0,1,18 June 2007
Duck Soup," did not age well
","I know it is a classic, but it did not flow as a movie with me. I also know that this was a different age for movies, but mainly it was not that funny. There were some really funny scenes mainly the mirror gag and the declaration of war dance number, but honestly at that point I was expecting song and dance numbers where as before that point I was not expecting any signing or dancing. I get where the humor was coming from, but it just was not funny to me. There were enough scenes that did not feel as if they belonged at all; mainly the peanut stand scenes. Also the fourth Marx brother was the most plastic performer there. Harpo was the best and would not have minded seeing more of his type of humor, but it just felt so out of place with the rest of the movie. The fact that it was short saved it from getting tiring, but it still dragged for me. I liked how the mustache was painted on. The fact that they got me a few laughs gives it a few points and then also the fact that they tried a few political jabs was interesting, but overall I felt more than a little disappointed. I really wanted to like it and having seen the mirror scene done by Lucille Ball and G. Marx I was not disappointed, but this version was funny, but as a movie not what I feel as if a modern film viewer would love.",6,7,12,24 January 2010
Edward Scissorhands," surprisingly good
","I know why Tim Burton is considered one of the best directors of our time. I have not seen a lot of his movies, but all of them are always en enjoyable movie experience. This was a silly film with little in terms of a story, but it was so well executed and the MUSIC. Danny Elfman is the man. The two of them really do make a great team. I was talking to a friend of mine, Pat, what makes a movie enjoyable is the ability to make the viewer get drawn into the world that is created. Just knowing this is a Tim Burton film made it very easy. I was totally ready to get drawn into anything he threw at me. I loved Johnny Depps performance and I am starting to see why people think so highly of his acting ability (I was thinking he was just a pretty face who played a pirate). He really did a very good job with this role. I loved the world that Burton created and big props to the set design. I think the best thing about the movie was how Burton takes a ridiculous creation and made people love it at first and it was only until it started threatening their morals was he rejected. I loved how the town people loved their new haircuts and dog's haircuts. But they kept the styles even after they started hating him. The snow idea was brilliant and I have to say that it was very well written. I have to say that a lot of the movies I have been watching I am giving very high ratings, but I am only trying to watch movies that I feel as if I would like going in and I am getting better at choosing them.",9,0,0,15 June 2007
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," First movie of 2014
","I did not love this movie, but I did not hate it. I am not sure if I even liked the movie, but I did not dislike it. For every cool moment there was an eye rolling moment. I found some of the gore funny, but nothing to write home about. The witch design was the coolest part of the movie and I wished during the final witch battle that the director showed off some of the other witches more. Even with these entertaining moments there are some terrible story moments. I am not going to go into details about specifics, but there was more than one groan. The acting was not campy enough for the premise and Renner cannot pull off a Bruce Campbell like character which this movie needs. I think there is some potential in retelling of old school fairy tales, but this is a very middling affair.",5,1,3,6 January 2014
Dark City," Great Sci-Fi
","I remember watching this movie when I was in my late teens sometime after watching the Matrix for the first time and thinking that the Matrix just ripped this movie off in a lot of different ways, even the final showdown between the hero and villain. They just combine the 'brain in the vat' idea that one learns in a freshman philosophy course and this movie to get the Matrix.I think Proyas crafted a nearly perfect science fiction film. It delves into the idea of self and what makes us human. The same questions that the Strangers ask are the same questions that we ask ourselves, but we are not closer to the truth than then are. By expanding the boundaries of reality Proyas provided us a mirror in which we may examine human existence, which has haunted us since we were able to ask ponder the concept.At first the miniature work was off putting, but eventually it grew on me until it added to surrealism of the movie. The atmosphere was pitch perfect throughout and the lighting throughout the film was perfect. Considering the movie occurs mostly with little light I never found that the movie was too dark, but always just the right level of lighting. I loved the combination of the different periods and the noir feel that was brought to the film. I really think this movie could be considered a noir film.I really like William Hurt in most things that he is in and here he brings all the brevity needed for a good noir detective. Jennifer Connelly was beautiful as always, but did not bring too much to the table. I ended up loving Sutherland's character even though I was annoyed with him at first. His speech pattern really elevated the sense that nothing in this universe makes sense. He is the only one that knows what is going on, but he is the only character, except for the Strangers, who does not feel like they belong. I must say that I was not thrilled with Sewell and I feel as if there may be another actor that could have pulled this role better. He was not bad by any means, but I never connected with him in the way I think Proyas intended.This movie is really on the verge of being a masterpiece and the main criticism for the movie is the ending. I loved the idea of the ending the movie the way that it did, but at the end of the movie I was thinking that I wish the music was better. I got really pulled out of the scene because I felt like the music was not in tune with the scene. Also Sewell took to the idea that he would be the ultimate creator of the universe in stride. Maybe it was built into the memories that Sutherland gave him, but he just kind of went with it and did not really look back about it.I really do enjoy this movie and its originality puts above most films out there. This is the type of movie that I would love to share with people and show them that film making is not just about explosions, but that atmosphere and an original story can be truly entertaining. It is just too bad that the ending fell flat for me or this would have gone done in my mind as one of the best films of the 90's.",8,0,2,22 August 2010
Ratatouille," Another pixar film
","One has to love any Pixar film. This one is a lot of fun. I would say loved the music the best about this movie. It was just some extremely well paced music that really gave me the feel of the movie. Another thing that stood out and popped was the lighting and the whole color schemes of the movie. Just wonderful looking in every sense of the word. All of these movies have some really cliché message that they are trying to get across and it does a pretty good job of it. The love interest was not totally necessary and it annoys me how they always try to put them into movies. The voice acting was very nice and a lot of the voices where not even recognizable. They get a good number of big names to voice some of the characters, but it seems like they only pick them because they would do the characters justice. It was a lot of fun, but in the end it just another pixar film which are always a good time.",8,0,1,25 November 2007
Spirited Away," this movie is pure movie magic
","One of my favorite movies of all time. That is really all there is to say about it. Since I need to have a certain number of words I will just put a few things in even though I could go on and on about this movie. First of all this movie above all else looks fantastic. It looks like nothing else and really understand that film is a visual medium that can be used to tell a story and introduce a viewer to characters that they are able to become invested in. I do not know how much I relate to Chihiro, but I was completely invested in her adventure. There was so much character growth shown in obvious actions and behaviors, but it felt genuine and never forced. No Face will always be one of my favorite characters of all time and that is because of what he achieves with so little time on screen and almost no dialog. I love everything about this movie and there are no weak points in the film. This movie will always maintain a special spot in my heart and is truly one of the finest films ever made in my opinion.",10,1,2,26 May 2010
Die Hard 2," The fact it is a Die Hard is its only saving point
","This movie just was not that good and the only good thing about it was that it is a Die Hard movie. First of all everything felt forced. They tried to do the Christmas thing and whole set up was way to contrived. The dumb police chief, the black technician, and the crazy maintenance man all felt really really fake. Plus they need to put the stupid journalist in this movie. Bad move. I did like the over the top violence and the fact that John McClane is not someone who stops. The only good line was when he blows up the plane at the end. The screaming of Holly at the end was a bit too much. But I did like the new reporter. The slitting of the guys throat still makes me jump and the fact that Stuart and the military guy were working together was obvious and just really bad. The music was not good and the action scenes were even a little week. I did like the snow mobile and the Annex fight scene, but the first one did not feel quite right. The radio showing up on the desk was just a bunch of lazy screen writing. John McClane was still the lovable a$$hole and a lot of fun but some of his one liners were just plain awful. This is my least favorite out of the three movies, but it is still fun to watch.",6,3,5,31 May 2007
District 9," perfect summer film
","I cannot say enough good things about this movie. It has everything a summer movie needs and has everything that a classic movie needs. It has fun explosion and violence galore with plenty of cringe moments. The pacing is impeccable and I have not seen an action film fit in so much character development without slowing down the movie at all. I love the direction choice with the interviews and cutting back to what seemed like a documentary crew, but that sense was quickly loss and it felt like an action film again. The weapons were sweet and the impact that they had really made me believe that people would go through a lot of effort to gain control of them. My favorite part of the movie was the fact that some of the reactions that the humans had to the aliens were so strong, but perfectly mirror the way other humans tend to react to one another in similar situations. The action was fun and the last third of the movie was filled with lots of fun. Some critics complain that the last third was just a standard action flick, but I must disagree and that is because of the lead actor. He pulled off a transformation that matches some of the best performances I have seen this year and he did without a single acting credit to his name. The minor complaints that I have are that the story does not always make sense as it does with a lot of science fiction movies. Now that I think about it most of the time I hate the shaky cam, but this time it did not bother me because it was not used over the top and nothing like what the Bourne movies do. The fact that this movie was made for so little money does not show for a second. The fact that they used real slums for most of the filming completely immersed me in the world extremely quickly. I love the use of dialog and how they were all able to communicate with each other, but never spoke each others languages. The kid at the end was campy, but since it worked so well I do not mind at all. I really look forward to what everyone involved in this movie can do in the future. This movie was so much fun and I cannot recommend it enough and this will probably be on of the movies I will buy on Blu Ray as soon as it comes out and make everyone watch it.",9,2,6,16 August 2009
Wreck-It Ralph," Enjoyable fun film
","Cute movie with some decent voice acting by the leads. I thought Jane Lynch did not hit the right note, but everyone else was fantastic. I was expecting to hate SIlverman, but was extremely surprised by how much she put into the role. I was also super surprised to see that Alan Tudyk was in the movie at all and did a fantastic job as the 'King'. was I would not say that the movie is top of the line, but it I thoroughly enjoyed it. I loved the set design and the world building was pretty well done. The biggest issue I had with the movie was Ralph's motivation kind of lame and drove much of the story. As his motivations changed the story was much more relatable and engaging. My favorite part of the movie would be the idea of what it means to be a good person. It definitely has a really good message that I would recommend kids engage with. Overall it was an enjoyable film, but there was nothing that really caught me. I would watch again and recommend it kids.",7,2,3,3 December 2014
28 Days Later...," not sure why this movie is not higher rated
","I was totally blown away by this movie. I went into the movie knowing that is not just another zombie film, but that still did not prepare me for what I saw. From the opening scene with monkey in a clockwork orange chair, it kept me smiling at how intelligent the film was. Cillian Murphy gave an outstanding performance and I would love to see what this guy is capable of in the future. The opening in the hospital and the empty streets of London really made the whole atmosphere of the movie. The zombies were not scary, but I don't think of zombies as scary. The best thing about the movie was that I would have welcomed a death at the hands of the zombies instead of death at one of the humans (especially if I was a woman). First of all when I learned the intent of the army guys that is when the movie actually got scary. The rest of the movie was a perfect build up to man reacting to man. Not man reacting to zombies. But man reacting to the horrible nature of man. Not that the man react in a good way, but boy did he react. I reminded me of Rambo first blood, but instead of a big muscle bound guy it was a skinny little guy who was as scarier than any zombie. The social commentary was great and it really brought up the question of how many reacts under pressure. I loved how Cillain Murphy did not have to shoot anyone and literally ripped one of the guys apart with his bare hands. The ending was whatever, but boy was that a great movie. The only reason I did not give it a ten was I was not a fan of the female character even if she was really well acted, I did not think she was necessary. I actually think it would have been more powerful if the little girl was the only one who made it out alive. Great movie though. Creepy, but not because of the zombies, but because of the crazy things humans do to each other.",9,3,4,31 January 2008
The Little Mermaid," Oh how I love thee Disney movies
",What can I say about this movie. I grew up watching this and I don't care if I am a little girl or not I love this movie. I think it is really well done and it maybe the last of the classic Disney films. For me the best part is the songs. I love all of them and I think they are all really well done and fit into the story well. Having Sebastian being a conductor made it a little easier. I must say I still get a bit of a wave of emotion when I see King Tritan give up his daughter so she can be happy. One of my favorite scenes which amazes me every time I see it is when Sebastian decides to help Ariel. The look on Ariel's face and Sebastian's body language are amazing. I think they really were able to create a whole slew of characters with very unique characteristics and movements. I also have to say I thought the use of the accents and how none of them seemed to come from anywhere made me smile because it was silly and just clichÃ©. This will be one of the movies that my kids will watch and will in my mind always be a classic,9,8,8,20 June 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," better than i expected on repeated viewing
","The first time I saw this I was not thrilled with it and may have only given it a 6 maybe even a 5. But on a second viewing I really enjoyed it. The special effects were awesome. The acting was what we should expect from a comic book movie. The cast was for the most part perfect and no complaints there. The problems I had mostly to do with the writing. The introduction of the new members of the brotherhood was really dumb and then they become instant go to guys. The other thing is that a lot of the villains were not fleshed out. I would have loved to seen just little scenes where some of the lesser known mutants got to at least fight a little bit. Or at least make some of the villains have some sort of power instead of just getting their butts kicked at the end. The adding of the power of being able to sense a mutants powers was stupid and did not help at all. The movie was still really enjoyable to watch. Ellen Page being in it did not hurt at all either. I did like how the writers did not feel bad about killing off any of the main characters. The last scene was cool and I hope they leave it at that. I do wish they did more with Colassas. There were plenty of things that I would have done differently just from my stand point, but overall I was pleased. It was fun and it did feel as if there was some sort of ending even it was open ended. I want to see an iceman spin off just because he had some much potential in the comic.",7,0,1,13 January 2008
I Am Legend," disappointing
","The movie was not bad, but there is nothing to make me say it was cool. I would recommend it to some of my friends, but not any of them that like the classic type of film making. A lot of the story elements were not followed through on. I think the coolest thing was seeing NYC all broken down. Since that is the best thing about the movie then I would not call it a great movie. But it was entertaining. The action was OK and the special effects were not the best. The creature effects were not great. I think Will Smith did a decent job, but for the most part I do not see any range in him as an actor (I have not seen the Hurrican yet to be fair to him). The dog part was touching, but I think that is just because I love dogs so much. The end was pretty stupid and I was like why did it have to end that way. I do not know how the book ended, but I think there could have been a little less Hollywood ending. It seemed like the producers wanted a non-Hollywood ending, but it was still producers asking for a non-holiday ending. The coolest thing that the movie never touches upon is that the vampires get smarter and are learning. I like how they did not actually make them vampires, but just vampire like, but I think that is more of an element from the book. In the end it was pretty unsatisfying. I do not think I would watch it again, unless I have a bunch of friends that insist on it.",6,1,2,23 December 2007
Kick-Ass," Not going to change the face of film making
","This is not a bad movie by any means. It is an OK movie that I thoroughly enjoyed, but it will not change the face of film making. There was nothing remarkable about the film. The only scene that I thought was original was the one scene where where Big Daddy's back story is fleshed out. I like how it became a comic book itself and somehow was able to maintain the pseudo realistic tone of the film, while providing an over the top comic book back story for one of the characters. It was funny. The action was fun. The story aspect that allowed Hit Girl to attack the end guy was pretty well done, but for the most part I do not see what all the hype it. I enjoyed it, but as a movie it was only OK. The story was predictable and the trailer attempted to steer you in one direction it really did not pan out to have any engaging twists. Plus the 'hero' gets the girl stuff really annoyed me. I thought it was silly and they attempted to build up to it but it was still a silly moment. Oh well. Fun to watch, but I will not shout it praises at the top of a mountain.",7,2,10,2 May 2010
Gran Torino," how is this ranked so high
","I had no intention of watching this, but my friend called me up and asked me if I wanted to watch it. I must say that I do not know why people love Eastwood's movies so much. I felt as if it was just not put together well. Maybe that is not the best way of putting it, but I would definitely say that he has no originality and does not bring anything new to the table as a director. To me it seems as cookie cutter as one can get with movies of this type. I felt as if the acting was terrible, but there were moments when I thought Eastwood was good, but not enough for me to think that he did a good job with the movie. I do not think that the script was all that strong to begin with and the dialog was a weak as it could get. I know the movie is about breaking views about stereo-types and prejudice and crap like that, but it did not resonate at all. I found myself laughing at a lot of racial slurs and I do not know if that was intentional, but it took away from the seriousness of the movie for me. Being a minority growing up with a lot of racists in my life might have skewed my view on this, but I do not think this was a realistic progression for any of the characters. This movie is as formulaic as it gets from the script to the music choices to the acting. Nothing unique about this movie to make me want to rate it any higher.",6,5,9,28 June 2009
The Hurt Locker," good movie, but over hyped
","The best thing about this movie was Jeremy Renner. The writing for the character was great and I really enjoyed the fact that it did not try to take sides in terms of the war and only tried to show why these men do what they do. To me a great central character is key to a film and without this I think this would have been just another action movie. People were claiming that this had some of the most intense action I was never overwhelmed as I was expecting. This may have been a product of hype, but the action served a purpose to showing why this character is who he is and what he experiences. Some of the scenes were played too long and were not that exciting for me. I think they should have put some facts on what the human body does when in one of those suits and the fact that they are all volunteers. I really love the supermarket scene at the end. I think the sniper scene in the middle was nothing special and there was a smarter way of showing the team coming together more related to defusing bombs. The scene felt out of place and broke up the movie right in the middle. Also I do not think the scene when all three of them go down the alley was in line with the character. I do not think he would have put them in danger no matter how much he was losing it. I know it was supposed to be a weak character moment as a consequence of sneaking out of the base to do nothing, but it did not fit with me. There is a lot of good about this movie. I honestly do not think it is an Oscar contender, but it still was one of the better movies I saw this year. People should still watch this movie, but I feel as if a lot of people will like the superficial aspects of the movie which are emphasized instead of the character.",8,0,4,19 January 2010
Meet Joe Black," surprisingly good
","I actually enjoyed this movie and would say that premise was the most interesting part. I am currently interested in how one can betray death in film and literature and I feel as if this had a very interesting take on the subject. Honestly my favorite parts of the movie were with Anthony Hopkins basically standing up to death letting him know that we was not scared. The love story was the center of the film, but I wished that they spent more time on Death's exploration of the world and all of it's mysteries. There was so much more that they could have done with that part of the film. The movie was a bit long, but I somehow got drawn in. The music was wonderfully scored and it was well casted. I honestly could have done without the ending and I would have almost preferred that the guy in the coffee shop would have stayed dead. I really liked the scene where Death was explaining how he was able to multitask and how it Anthony Hopkins was able to turn it on Death and show him humans work on a level he cannot understand. I will use a bit of these interactions in my story, but I did actually enjoy the movie.",8,2,3,11 March 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," doug jones is the man
","This movie can be summarized with the sentence Doug Jones is the man. That was the only good thing about the movie. The special effects fight scenes with Doug Jones as the silver surfer were perfect. He maybe the best physical actors out there right now. It is a shame there are no more silent films because that man would own the screen. The rest of the acting was bad and somehow Jessica Alba did not look that good. There was little to no chemistry between cast members. I realized that this goes back to classic Fantastic Four, but the whole point of doing these movies is that we get to modernize them. I don't want them to be so hokey. But the only reason this movie did not get a lower rating was because of Doug Jones. Before we go any further what was up with Galactus. They totally did not address any of that. We understood he was a threat but he was an awesome force to be reckoned with. Silver Surfer just cannot go up and blow himself up and kill Galactus. Number one Galactus gave Silver Surfer his power and he would give him enough to let him KILL Galactus. One just does not kill Galactus like that. It was dumb. But back to the one good thing. Doug Jones was perfect and when he was off the board he was even better. That makes me wish that they do a Silver Surfer movie. Oh yeah the stupid one liners made me want to hurt someone. Stan Lee's cameo was really good but overall the 20 minutes of Silver Surfer was the only cool thing of the movie.",3,6,13,17 June 2007
Grave of the Fireflies," great movie, but not hyped too much for me
","Don't get me wrong I really enjoyed this movie, but as a whole I just did not get the emotional impact that many other describe. Maybe because I am cold hearted robot or maybe because I was watching during an unbearable heat wave, but it just did not hit me that hard. There is no real criticism for the movie, but I am not going to go out and tell everyone about the movie. A large part of the emotional impact comes from being familiar with the culture and the whole idea of having to rebuild a life after it being destroyed, but it did not hit me. I would say Seita was an aggravating character and it seems as if there must have been plenty more options than just living in the caves. Other than that a few of my few favorite points is that they do not hide the fact that this was going to be a sad movie right from the beginning and the fact that it began the way it did made it tragic. It was very slow, but the slowness added to the slow decay of the children. One of my favorite parts was the most devastating thing for Seita was when he finds out that Japan 'the greatest empire in the world' was defeated and surrendered unconditionally that he finally breaks down. Even when his sister dies he does not show the emotion which shows the Japanesse issue in having to rebuild what was once thought a superior society to conform to something that they must have hated. The fire bombings of Japan is one of the most tragic events of our world's history. The horror of it was lessened a bit, but it was still potent. A very well done movie, but because everyone had told me that this was a great movie it disappointed me a little bit (but it might also be because I am a robot).",7,3,13,4 August 2007
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," not a great movie, but a good companion to the book
","This just did not work as a movie. Being a fan of the books and having read all of the books I am quite familiar to the world and the storyline. For those who have never read the books though this movie is a mess of story lines that just does not make sense. Having read the books and this one being one of my favorites, it was a great movie because it showed things that I loved to see. Luna Lovegood was perfect and was more perfect than I could have imagined. That little actress was so good I could not believe it. I really felt for the character and thought of how great it would be to have her on your side. The wizard battles were totally awesome, but could have been longer and showed some more action. I wish I saw the statues come to life in the last battle like in the book, but they did not. The statues looked better in the movie than I had pictured, but they did not spring to life. I don't want to say none of the kids in the movie can act, but I think they were just given with some pretty weak material. The only reason this movie gets a 7 and not a 6 is because one of the best characters in the book came to life in a such a way I could not imagined. A really big beef I had with the movie was that they left out my favorite scene in all of the books. The one where Neville is with his parents in the hospital grounded the whole world and gave the kids something to fight for that everyone can relate to. There is no destiny involved with Neville's character and he did not deserve the life he was handed. He deserved to have the loving parents that were taken away from him and the movie almost ignores that part totally. Neville was turned into my favorite character in that moment and now he just another silly kid who has a reason to fight, but we aren't able to see into his character like the book let us. Like my summary says it is not a good movie, but having read the books it was really nice to see the world we have come to love.",7,0,2,21 February 2008
Annie Hall," smart and a great character study
","This is probably one of the smartest films I have ever seen. It is witty in ways that we just do not see in the theater anymore. The structure of film is one of most enjoyable I have seen in a while. It was fresh and kept me on my toes. I never knew what to expect with each scene. The dialog is some of the sharpest I have seen in a while. You have to love all of the characters and each of them were grounded in some way that never felt artificial. What can we say about Diane Keaton. I can see why so many feel for her and how they are so many characters that try to be like her, but very few feel as genuine as Annie. Sometimes it can be annoying when an actor comes through in their character, but when it works like it did in this movie it cannot be any better. My favorite scene is when the rock journalist made a reference to Kafka and how she meant it was a compliment and how absurd that is. At the end of the day this movie is essential viewing and a real great experience.",10,0,0,29 May 2009
The Graduate," Beyond expectation
","I will say at the start the only reason I did not give this film a 10 was because I was not convinced that Ben and Elaine could fall in love that quick and I guess it goes back to what makes me mad at a lot of classic pieces of literature where people just fall in love in a matter of minutes. But other than that this film was brilliant. I must say I am a little young to really get the movie for its times, but since I do listen to Simon and Garfunkel that helped with me getting into the soundtrack and what the soundtrack brought to the movie. I love watch classic films like this and seeing how they are parodied a lot, but the best parts of this movie cannot be parodied. The best parts of this was the use of long shots. They were not exceedingly long, but long enough to make one notice. He only cut when he needed to. I loved the acting and at first I thought Dustin Hoffman was one dimensional, but as the movie progressed it ended out to be a perfect performance. One cannot say how perfect Anne Banecroft was and how she really was able to pull off the sexual object so well. I loved how she was so insecure and it came out, but only when she was weak. Some of the shots were so good. I liked how Nichols would often use the framing of the face to great success. It seemed as if he insisted that if he was going to shoot someones face he was not going to do it right on and they were almost always off to the side. I really loved the camera work and it is what makes the movie stand out as something that will last. It amazes me that more directors don't even dare to try something of things that Nichols does in this movie with what seems like little effort. A friend, who knows movies, told me to watch this who was 16 when this movie came out and he says it is possible his favorite movie of all time so I had a lot of expectations for this film and it surpassed all of them. It was surprisingly funny and it a real gem of movie making.",9,1,2,3 June 2007
Taken," Liam Neeson made this movie
","I was debating whether to give this a 7 or 8, but I gave it an 8 based on how much fun it was to watch Liam Neeson. This movie would have been nothing with anyone else in the role. Nothing was overtly wrong with the movie and nothing was great except Neeson's performance. I loved story flowed a little too nicely and he got his information almost too quickly, but I bought it and was easily overlooked. It was interesting that I almost looked forward to Neeson's dialog more than his action, but both complimented each other in a way you rarely ever see in action movies. I honestly like Luc Besson probably more than I should and I will not hide that fact. I do not think this is a particularly good movie, but it was a lot of fun to watch at least once. I may never watch this again, but if it is on cable in 10 years I will probably linger.",8,1,2,23 June 2009
Avatar," did they lose the screenplay
","I do not think there is any original way of saying that this movie is in one aspect possibly one of the most revolutionary movies that I have seen, but boy is it a bad movie. I realize that I gave Beowulf a good score and the rational that went into giving that a movie a good score also applies here, but the complete lack of anything inspired outside of the technical aspect of the movie is discouraging. I do want to say that the score was good, but did not stand out for me. I saw this movie having to sit in the 7 or 8 row and I had such a terrible head ache at the end of it, but I could not take my eyes off of the screen. I really did not think 'that must be CG' as many times as I would have expected and did really get caught up in the world created. All of the great things about the technical side can only begin to describe the experience and it really needs to be experienced for oneself. The writing was terrible and I could predict the story line way to quickly. I even saw how they were going to transfer the characters into their avatars permanently within the first 30 minutes. The acting honestly was not that good, but something must be said about the characters that were simply motion captured. I think they could have turned out to be fully fleshed out characters if they were written to be more than 1.5 dimensional. There were not quite one dimensional, but not even close to being fully fleshed out. It is a shame too because I really like a lot of the actors in the movies. My friend I saw it with described it perfectly as the best Fern Gully remake ever. I just want to see what a creative team like Pixar can do with technology like this and not just see what Cameron can do with a near unlimited budget.",8,1,3,31 December 2009
Toy Story 2," Pixar magic
","It is funny. I have not rated a lot of the Pixar movies, but I have watched them all multiple times. Except this one. Somehow I never have seen this movie after who knows how many years of it being out and me loving Pixar. It is sad that I have to give it a 9 and not a 10 and the only reason is that is not as good as Toy Story. It is a great movie that technically is a huge stop up for Pixar and some of the effects were fantastic. I am mainly thinking of how good some of textures were and the reflection on the wooden floor of the toys. The story is great and funny, but did not resonate with me as much as the other films. I am not a hundred percent sure why, but there are probably a multitude of reasons. It is hard to recapture the love I had for the first movie with the same characters. I do love that the animators actually have quite a bit of story to tell with these characters and sequels do not feel forced. There is nothing wrong with this film other than it is not as good as some of the other Pixar films.",9,0,1,5 June 2009
Up," This is why Pixar is the best there is
","What can I say about this movie. It is perfect in every way. First of all it looked beautiful and probably not as mind blowing as some of Pixar's in terms of visuals it still looks great. The second thing is that the voice acting is top notch like always and nothing less than one would expect. The music never stood out and over powered a scene but there were definitely moments when there would be a little piano melody that would really tug at the heart strings. I guess the most important thing about a movie like this is the story which was told masterfully by Peter Doctor. If I could a favorite Pixar director it maybe Peter Doctor mainly because I think he has the ability to tell a very adult story that never strays away from being a children's film. He totally nailed it Monster's Inc. and was probably for me one of the more emotionally moving Pixar film, or film in general for me right after this one. If you try to explain to someone this movie just in terms of the the character arc it is a very grownup story, but Pixar puts in in the perfect amount of heart, warmth, humor and just magic in general. I do not think I even need to point out any particular moment, but so much of it is just perfect. If I did have one complaint it would be I wish I would have seen some sort of resolution with respect to Russel's character and his father. Now I must say a word about the environment that I saw the movie in. I saw it at 2:10 in the afternoon with nothing other than kids and their mothers. There was a little girl maybe 3 or 4 sitting next to me with her mom that had to keep getting up to go to the bathroom. Except she only had to go when the movie slowed down with respect to a personal moment for Carl. As soon as some action picked the little girl could have cared less about going to the bathroom. Their was chatter all around me, but I loved it. It was perfect. The parents laughed at moments aimed at them and the kids laughed at moments aimed at them and then we all laughed at the moment when it was right. I loved the experience. It is another great film by Pixar and I can only hope that they keep up the quality.",10,1,3,30 May 2009
It's a Wonderful Life," pure magic
","I have to fill this with 10 lines, but it does not require 10 lines to say that this movie is perfect and one of my favorite movies of all time. The ending gets me every time somehow. I love Jimmy Stewart and cannot emphasize how much he makes this movie work. I think he really gets to show off both this comical skills and his dramatic ability. I saw this on the big screen at a local theater house and it really was a magical type of experience. No matter how many times I watch this movie find something new to fall in love with or just fall in love with the same thing over and over again. I will probably watch this movie at least once every year for the rest of my life and never get tired of it.",10,1,5,31 December 2009
Die Hard," This movie is so much fun
","I think this is a great movie. I love the campy one liners and the over the top action, but it was a great movie. It was well paced and they are no real complaints about the movie. Rickman was amazing and it is one of the best bad guys performances and the one scene when we snaps at John's wife is priceless. It is kind of fun to see how a lot of action movies pull from a lot of stuff from this movie (even though I sure this movie got a lot of it's substance from other movies). One of the highlights of the movie is the music and when the bad guys actually manage to open the vault one really feels a swelling of emotion as the music grows. The one problem I have is that the LAPD is not that dumb and the FBI agents are not that dumb and the fact that Al knew better than both of them was kind of silly, but I did like the dynamic of the two FBI agents and the way they fit into the movie as a bunch of idiots, but it was almost a little too much. The humor they tried to inject with the black guy who was cracking the vault was a little dry, but not to the point where I hated him. The limo driver's smile got annoying too, but I liked his character for the most part. Bruce Willis did a perfect job with the character and played him perfect. I like action films like this where there is unnecessary swearing and violence, but it works and I hate how Hollywood is making a lot of action films with a pg-13 rating when i think it would be so much more enjoyable with just letting them swear and be really violent. I know one does not need the violence, but I think it does so much more for the movie experience by letting the characters express themselves with their violence. The last gripe I have is that the ending with Karl jumping up out of nowhere was totally unnecessary and it really annoyed me. The cop did not need a complete arc and John's and his hug was all the ending needed. This will probably always be one of the my favorite action films.",9,10,13,28 May 2007
Love Actually," Not a chick flick
","I think this is a one of the best movies that has come out in a long time and actually got a lot of recognition for it being a good movie. First of all the cast is beyond amazing. Some of my favorite actors and actresses are all there. They are some of the best actors out there right now. I think it may be one of the best put together casts that I have ever seen. Each part was cast perfectly and the only one that had a little trouble pulling off their role would have been Hugh Grant, but he had a very hard role to fulfill. I won't talk to much about the actors, but some need to take note. In only a few minutes of screen time Liam Neeson makes one feel really sad and I honestly got a little choked up when the songs starts at the funeral. That is impressive to get that much emotion in a role in such a short period of time. The next that need mentioning is just about all the scenes with Emma Thompson. I like the scene at the end of the play when she confronts Alan Rickman and pulls it off really really well. The next mention would be Laura Linney who I think it is just wonderful and I loved her role in the movie. My next is actually the young women who play Auriela. She put some physical mannerisms in there that made that character extremely desirable and made me believe that it was possible for Colin Firth to fall in love with her with such limited interaction. I almost fell in love with her. Now onto the substance of the film. I like how it approached just about every type of love and showed that it is not just boy gets girl, boy loses girls, boy gets girl back. I loved the different type of loves, from the love of two life long friends, love for a brother in need, a love between kids, a hopeless love, and all the problems that maintaining that love or even obtaining love. The ability of love to transcend language, age, and social class are all there. I liked how the movie dealt with nearly every type of love, but did not bore me by making an entire movie out of each story. But making the movie this way requires an incredibly talented cast and they had that. The soundtrack I loved and before this gets too long I would like to emphasize the point this is not a chick flick. It is just a really good movie that makes one feel good.",9,0,1,3 June 2007
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," meh
","I hate to give this movie a 6, but it just did not do it for me. I did love the soundtrack and I intend on taking a listen of some of the bands featured. My favorite part of the movie was how the city played such a big part and it reminded me of all of my times running around the city until all hours of the night. That part of the movie the the most entertaining, but other than that I thought it was surprisingly weak. I have to say that Michael Cera is one of the funniest human beings in the world in my opinion, but this movie did not work for me. His character is incredibly cool and likable, but somehow a jerk some of the time and awkward at the same time. If his character was more consistent it would have helped. Kat Dennings was pretty good too, but the relationship and the characters were not consistent. There supporting cast was a big plus and the one drunk friend reminded me of a friend I had from undergraduate. Not so much the drunk aspect, but her insecurities and her short comings as a person, but the great amount of love she had for her friends. Overall I did not hate the movie, but it suffered from a pacing problem and the characters did not feel consistent, especially Cera's character. I can think of very few that I would recommend this movie too, but it did make me laugh quite a few times.",6,3,3,16 February 2009
The Bridge on the River Kwai," fantastic even thought it is a bit old
","I enjoyed this film and intend on giving it a 9 out of 10 on IMDb. I considered an 8, but I thoroughly enjoyed watching the movie. I was not sure whether or not the bridge was destroyed or how it was going to go down. It was much more dramatic than I could have anticipated. It was a little campy, but Guiness held the ending by watching him realize how far his own ambitions had taken him. Guiness really held the movie together and I felt myself wanting to see him on screen. He really was fantastic and watching him at the end was perfect. I particularly liked seeing compose himself and remind himself that he is a gentleman in each meeting.I now have a slight man crush on William Holden and not because he was particularly good, but he was really charismatic in a few moments. The guy that played Saito was fantastic though. He had some really solid moments on screen and one can see how Ken Watanabe used this performance for his General in Letters from Iwo Jima. The scenes between Saito and Guiness were all great.So about the movie as a whole. I can see why it is so highly regarded and it really did feel epic, even on my small laptop, and I cannot even imagine watching this on the big screen. The jungle really did feel formidable and Lean did an excellent job of making it a character all of its own. The open shot did an excellent job of setting that up by combining the graves with thick jungle shots. It was an extremely memorable opening sequence for me. The movie even though it is terribly long never felt long to me and felt really well paced. When the Canadien and Holden start floating down the river the movie felt like an eternity, but in a good way because I really was not sure if that bridge was going to blow and how it would blow. To me it is really interesting that they made this war film without almost no one getting shot and very few on screens deaths. But we really have a great insight what war could do to these individuals and sense of duty that these individuals had. The loyalty of ever type is displayed here and it really is well done.I have to say one more thing about the ending. I love how they actually blew that stuff up and ran a actual train off the tracks. That is so great. You just cannot see stuff like that anymore. Someone would just do some special effects in the studio and it might look real, but for some reason I loved watching thatSo the reasons why it does not get a 10 is because of stupid reasons, but have to be taken into account. First of all I hated that stupid little love thing that they had going on with the local girls carrying their stuff through the woods. Completely unnecessary and just seemed silly. The Canadian was introduced later so they did have that much time to build him up but I felt as if by the end of the movie he was a weaker character. The last thing is probably the silliest, but I do not think the transfer I had was of the best quality so it seemed like some of the colors were blown out. Maybe it was just the quality of the film and the technology they had to colorize it back then, but it did not look the as good as I feel as it could have. It still felt huge and epic, but grainy at times.I guess that is it. There are probably a few other things, but this is way too long.",Null,0,1,17 July 2009
The Last King of Scotland," not really into these types of movies
","I am not really a fan of movies based extremely loosely on real life events or people. The only thing that set this movie apart was Whitaker and McAvoy. The story was meh and the writing was meh. The directing was nothing special, but what a performance by Whitaker. This will down in my memory as one of most memorable performances of all time for me. He really was electric to watch and hard to take your eyes off. He really propelled the movie into something that was actually enjoyable to watch. I have to say that I was pretty impressed by James McAvoy and I think he has a lot of potential and if he manages his career well has a hopeful future as an actor. I guess there is not a lot more to say about this movie. I loved watching Whitaker and that was about it. Whitaker is the only reason this movie is an 8 and not higher.",8,0,2,29 June 2009
Die Hard with a Vengeance," I love this movie
","I think this movie would have only gotten a 7 if they never made Die Hard 2, but since this was so much better than Die Hard 2 it gets a 9. The whole premises feels very real especially after 9/11. I love how Jeremy Irons is the bad guy. Something we can learn from this Die Hard and the first Die Hard is that it pays off to get good actor for your bad guy. They are not evil, they are just really really greedy. I like the line 'I am a soldier not a monster' characterizes both Hans and Simon very well. Jackson was perfect in this and they need him to add a new level to the series. Just having a one man army feels a bit old. Since the main bad guy had a vengeance issue it was not absurd that John got mixed up into the whole thing. The one thing that did annoy me was leaving out Holly. I love that lady and how she made him human. But they did reduce him to being an alcoholic which showed she was what made John great, but the fact he could bounce back showed that he can still do some damage, but needed a new friend. I loved how it took place in the NYC and I could recognize some of the sights and the streets. I think I walked on one of the same streets last week while I was visiting my brother. After seeing how bad the second movie is this movie just felt so right. They did not try to force any crazy characters in there and they stuck to a tried and true formula and pulled it off quite well.",8,0,0,31 May 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," A lot of potential, but unsatisfying
","The story itself had a lot of potential, but it in the end it just did not deliver. The ending was cliché and everyone knew that he would not die and that we would end up with the girl. I loved Emma Thompson, but she was over the top at times. The acting for the most part was not anything fancy. The special effects really weren't necessary and often felt contrived. I would have preferred if they just left them out. At the beginning it was OK, but just randomly placed in there after that did not work. Will Ferrel was not that funny and did not pull of the role. I still give it a 6 because I enjoyed the premises and I loved how Karen was crazy and so morbid. I was reminded about how Dickens said that after writing a book the author got to know the characters so well that it has hard to leave them after months (or years) of them being some of the most important people in the authors life. I think they could have extended that relationship a bit more.",6,0,2,3 March 2007
The Lion King," Love it
","Not a lot to say about this movie other than it has a great cast. Top notch all of the way. The only weak thing for me is the love story between Simba and Nala. I did not buy into it when I was 11 and I did not buy into later in my life. The only weak point that seems really forced. I guess another weak point is the scar song. It is a fun song, but it does not seem like it fits into the rest of the movie. I love the music and probably one of my one favorite soundtracks that I can think of. Visually it was a great meshing of technology and hand drawn animation. It really is epic in its scope and the opening scene is a perfect way of building the universe. Great movie with lots of great memories.",9,1,1,6 December 2009
Iron Man," good solid fun
","There is not a terribly large amount to say about this movie. It was everything I could hope for from the movie. The casting was perfect. The script was solid. The special effects was where this really stood out in my mind. Most of the time I can tell when something is CG, but here they blended everything perfectly. The action scenes were amazing fun. They really got me pumped up (not to sound stupid). The one liners were good and not over the top because Tony Stark is supposed to be like that. They built up sequels perfectly but not too much (except of course the Nick Fury appearance). As far as I am concerned it was a perfect summer movie with all of the right parts; lots of action and lots of fun. I won't even begin talking about the scenes that I loved, because there are so many. The reason that it is not rated higher because it was nothing more than entertaining. I did not think the writing was better than average and the CG was the only thing that was better than average. It just appealed to the loser in me.",8,1,2,25 May 2008
Toy Story 3," I love Toy Story
","I did not expect a lot from this movie. I went into the movie with the mindset that they could not make 3 great movies with the same characters. I felt that the movie would fall flat and just resort to clichés. The movie felt right in so many ways. The writers took advantage of the fact that there were well established characters with well established relationships with each other. The fact that I grew up with these movies and these characters really made a difference. I was 11 when Toy Story came out and 15 years later it was a perfect progression for the characters. I really saw the characters grow up in unexpected ways, but never in a way that alienated the characters. The landfill scene while action filled was so emotionally charged that it just blew me away. It is rare that an action scene is able to hold so much emotion while keeping the characters in the spotlight. The last 15 minutes with Andy was the best way for the movie to end and really brought together the whole trilogy. The movie was funny, moving and just a good time the whole way through. The movie looked great I really loved the music. Everything came together in the most satisfying way. I cannot wait to own the trilogy and share them with future generations. This movie is destined to be a classic.",10,1,2,1 July 2010
Trainspotting," classic from Danny Boyle
","I am not sure if I want to give this a 8, or 9 because honestly it is hard to tell what they are saying more than once. So there is fantastic dialog, but if I cannot understand what they are saying it is not good. This goes hand in hand with the narration. I love Ewan McGregor in this, but since I had to focus trying to figure out what he was saying that I missed what was happening on screen sometimes. The reason that I give this a 9 though is because I love this movie. I really love how the direction reflects the tone of the film and what is happening on the screen. The introduction of the characters at the beginning with the narration gives so much information that is an overload honestly, but I think that is the point. I love how during his kicking of the habit after his overdose how there was no continuity between shots and it was as frenetic as possible. The music was awesome and I really loved some of the soundtrack choices. All of the acting was top notch and to pick out any of the cast as a stand out is hard because they all played it out perfectly. I think the most successful part of the film is that Boyle never makes you want to do heroine, but definitely is able to demonstrate why these people are hooked. As soon as you might think that you want to try some he just hits you in the right way so you DO NOT want to ever try it. I love how Renton at the end just says that I am a bad person and that there was no real hero here and the fact that we were rooting for those terrible human beings says a lot about the film. One of my favorite scenes is when Spudd is messing up with job interview and with Renton right before that trying to explain how to mess it up, but not too badly. Then Boyle takes two different cameras which from the shot differently and just cut between the two without disturbing the flow of the dialog at all. It really was a great scene and very simple trick that added to the feel of the scene and actually added a bit to the character. Great movie and it is great to see Boyle come into his own and create his own voice.",9,0,0,17 January 2010
Beowulf," Not a great movie if not for the 3D
","I loved this movie. I was smiling for almost all of it. The visuals were absolutely stunning and I cannot wait to see what the future has for this new type of movie making. The story was actually pretty weak and the writing was surprisingly bad considering I really like Neil Gaiman. It was not paced well. The dialog was lacking and the story was just not that good. I am not a fan of how Grendel's mother was a beautiful demon. I would have loved to have seen a story following Beowolf making a name for himself and them having the movie end with a battle with Grendel and then his mother. The other thing that I did not like was the who the nudity was handled. It reminded me and it seemed like most of the audience of the Austin Powers scene from the first movie. I think they should have just made an R-rated version and let the man meat be out there instead of using stupid props to cover it up. Even with the fact that it was not a great movie it looked so good it makes up for it. I actually flinch more than a few times at things coming at me or from behind me. I actually felt tempted to turn around occasionally to make sure a tree branch wasn't going to hit me in the back of the head. The faces did not show all of the emotion that real actors could, but it was still stunning. One of my favorite parts was a rather quite part of the movie where it was snowing on a little bridge. One can really see all of the snowflakes and how they actually looked layered. I describe say how cool the action sequenced looked and they must be seen for themselves. In all honesty this movie would have gotten a 6 or even a 5 without the 3D, but with the 3D the movie was a pure pleasure and is a once in a lifetime experience. I do want to mention it took a few seconds for my eyes to get used it, but after about 5 or 10 minutes my mind bought it and it only came up when I away from the screen.",9,1,3,1 December 2007
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Not what I was hoping for
","I love Wes Anderson. I think he is one of the most talented film makers out there right now. I must say that this is probably my least favorite film of his. I loved the music and it really set the mood for the movie. The animation was something special. I never expect to be surprised by stop animation and I always think I have seen it all, but there were just some fantastic shots for me. The dialog was fantastic for the most part and the writing was tight in that aspect. The reason that I give it a seven though is because I never connected with the film. I enjoyed all of the aspects of the movie, but it never came together with me. I did not connect with any of the characters and the story never seemed to flow for me with respect to the characters. My favorite character was the mother and she did not do anything and in the end did not have a satisfactory part of the story. I also did not feel any of the joy of being a kid while watching this film; not like with a pixar film. I know it is unfair to compare any movie to a pixar film, but one has to now. One of the biggest issues that I had with the movie was the use of 'cuss'. I felt like it was used to much. By the end of the movie I was getting tired of it and I wished Anderson and Baumbauch used it less and just used their wit, which they have more than 90% of Hollywood combined. I do not know why I did not enjoy this movie. I had my reservations because of the stop motion, but that was actually the most satisfying part of the movie. The biggest thing that the movie lacked for me was a character that was the emotional core of the film. There was nothing for me to connect on a human level. That is why I love Wes Anderson and without the emotional core it is just a quirky stop-motion movie that is a really good movie, but not the movie I was hoping for.",7,0,1,3 April 2010
Live Free or Die Hard," not a die hard movie
","Some of it was fun, but this is not a Die Hard movie. The first movie is a classic in my mind and I love that movie and character. Even if the rest of the films are not perfect at least the character was intact. In this movie I did not feel as if I was watching John McClane. They should have just named the character something else and the movie might have been slightly more enjoyable. I kept being disappointed by things and I never felt as if it was a Die Hard movie. I did not like the introduction of a 'young' sidekick with little to no chemistry with Bruce Willis. I am also not convinced that the actor (Tim O....) knows how to act. Everyone was actually pretty bad, even Kevin Smith. He was still probably the best actor in the movie. There were too many plot holes and I did not enjoy the hacker aspect. I seems like it is trying to be too trendy and it is annoying. Cool scenes in the movie were made less cool because John McClane does not do stuff like that. I am thinking of the car into the helicopter. I liked how he killed the villain at the end and was probably the only thing that felt right. Meh",5,2,3,6 December 2009
Amélie," Don't even need to say anything about this movie
","This movie will always be one of my favorite films, because not only is it an extremely well done movie in every aspect of movie making, but it is enjoyable to watch no matter what my mood. I really cannot think of a thing about this movie that I do not like. I think it has some of the most clever writing and one of the most effective character development devices. The quick two sentences about the person really gave a lot of flavor to the characters. I loved all of the acting and in particular the father really stands out in my mind. He is one of the funniest characters and is just fun. Amelie's personality is perfect and no one else could have pulled off the role. I totally fell in love with her the first time she looked in the camera and smiled. I liked the use of special effects and while most movies of this flavor it would look tacky it works so well. It almost reminds of Scrubs the way the fantasies play a role in the movie as a character development device and the writers of Scrubs must have watched this movie a lot. I love watching it again and again because each time I discover something new and every time that makes me smile. There is not much to say other than I love this movie and the reasons are obvious as soon as you watch it.",10,3,9,14 April 2007
300," All the elements of a great film, but not quite there
","I loved the movie and looking back on it I cannot think of a single thing about it I did not like, but somehow I cannot give it higher than a 7. The action scenes were beyond amazing and I actually enjoyed how much historically accurate some of the stuff was. Everything from the quote 'come back with your shield or on it' which is an actual phrase Spartans said to each other when they went to battle, to the battle formations that they used. The acting was what I expected and everything lived up to my expectation, but the movie did not seem to flow as well as it could have. This may be the first time that I think the editing actually took away from the movie. All of the action sequences were beyond bad-ass, but the scenes did not flow into each other that well. The scene where Butler's and Headley's character make love seemed over the top, but looking back at it I realized it was them saying good bye to each other, but it was not obvious in the moment. I did not expect the Spartans to leave the next day and it seemed as if they could have made the impact of their final good bye more powerful. I have to mention that this is one of the best looking films I have seen in a long time and it did an amazing job of creating an entirely new world based in our world and went well with the tone of the movie. The movie being loosely based in reality, but the movie was more of an excuse to have some beautiful images (some of them extremely gory) set to some powerful emotions. I think everyone should see this movie, because it is one of the best looking films out there, but it did not quite do it for me and I think it was the editing.",7,0,2,10 March 2007
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," timeless
","I would have to say I wish there were comedians that did not take themselves to seriously. Jon Stewert, Steven Colbert and Conan O'brien do a good job, but comedians just take themselves too seriously. This classic film goes beyond all levels of seriousness and turns out to be one of the funniest films of all time. At first I was only going to give this movie a 9, but I i cannot think of a single reason not to give it a 10. It is so absurd and does everything perfectly. These are some seriously funny people that work so well together. This movie must have been a blast to make and it shows when you watch it. I liked a lot of the little touches that made the movie just a little bit more ridiculous. The one guy using a club to try to club fish at one point is just really well placed and one has to think 'who thought of putting that there'. There are so many quotable lines and memorable moments. Everything from the killer rabbit to the failed Trojan bunny. I really want to see their other movies after watching this.",10,0,1,19 June 2007
Moon," great sci-fi movie
","I was debating a 8 or 9 and the only reason I was debating the 8 was because nothing really popped out for me as being a fantastic moment in the movie. It was a collection of great ideas and some top-notch acting, but there was very little that made me stand up and go this is fantastic except for the music. There were a few moments when the score really added to the film and I loved the variety and how the score was approached in a fairly simplistic manner. There always seemed to be a main instrument underlining the score for any particular moment and was not over powered by the rest of the instruments. I am always watching DVD extras where the composer describes how each character has its own instruments, but honestly it is always lost in the viewing of the movie. This was not the case here. There were some great piano melodies and a sweet bass part in the beginning. Also the lullaby type melody at the end when Sam1 is looking up at the stars is a piece and fits the movie perfectly. So enough about the music. The movie is a great debut from a director which I will keep my eye on in the future. The story is original and presented in the way that keeps the viewer guessing what happens. SAM ROCKWELL. What can you say about this performance. It is spot on and I literally could not believe my eyes when it come to seeing the different versions of Sam. You could see it, but wow. The way he held himself and really allowing himself to play two different versions of the same actor will go down in history as the way to play twins or clones from this point on. I hope for a Oscar nomination for this. I have not seen another performances this year that have stood out like that (or in a long time for that matter). The last great one was probably DDL in There Will be Blood. I love the fact that this movie is the perfect place to begin debates on a lot of topics that are actually becoming relevant in our society and culture that people are not aware of or decide to ignore. The obvious being the morality of cloning, but there are a lot more. I am perfectly happy with this movie and will recommend it and would like to sit down and watch it again at some point. Good movie. I hope we will get more good sci-fi like this in the future.",9,3,5,11 July 2009
Goodfellas," little trouble relating to anything in this movie
","I really enjoyed this movie and I thought it was very well done. A lot of people rave about some of the acting, but I think Ray Liotta did a pretty bad job and some scenes were just not right. I think it was extremely well directed and the long scene when Henry goes into the jazz club was perfect. I wouldn't even know how to set up a shot like that. I am not a director, but I cannot imagine it being easy with so many extras and and the timing must have been a nightmare. It really does set up the movie very well. I loved Tommy's character and being played by a smaller man makes it understandable why he was so crazy. I think the music was perfect. It started out with some great jazz vocals and then when one hears 'Cocaine' riff in the background one knows everyone's lives are going to go to hell. I liked how it ended with a punk song. Such a good soundtrack. The way the scenes were cut were great. The first part of the movie started with a lot of long cuts that were smooth and then it got sharper and much more frantic. Full props to Martin (I don't know how to spell his last name) and I liked the use of actual people involved in the case. The one problem I have with this movie is that I cannot relate to any of the characters or what they are going through. The motivations even if they are real seemed silly and it is like a bunch of kids on a playground. No one could do that movie better and the casting of Ray Liota was the only thing I would have changed and it will be timeless, but I cannot relate to it.",8,0,1,20 June 2007
The Bourne Supremacy," Meh
","Once again not a horrible film, but nothing special. The major complaint I had for the first Bourne movie was not felt here so it did not feel like a rushed book adaptation. The movie was not faster paced, but the story itself felt more contrived and like there was nothing special going on or nothing to set it apart from any other film like that. This movie also lacked Chris Cooper whom I enjoy very much. I did enjoy Joan Allen very much, but there was no real stand out acting. The action was typical, but the scene where he was scaling the wall was well done. I think I enjoyed the scene when he takes Nikki and avoids being followed. I don't know where the next movie is going to go, but in all honesty I barely care. Oh yeah it was also pretty funny when Matt Damon's character cried when his wife died. I do like Karl Urban, but he did not really get a chance to be bad ass. The end where Brian Cox was the insider was not surprising and felt forced. Overall not a good movie, but not horrible. It was find for killing a few hours over spring break.",6,0,1,7 April 2007
Princess Mononoke," Slow in the middle, but overall great
","I do love this movie. It is just a little slow in the middle. The soundtrack is amazing and the visuals are top notch. There is a reason that Miyazaki is a god among animators, but I honestly think this is one of his weaker films. The characters are one of the most important thing for a movie for me and this movie did not have the strongest characters. I enjoyed them and I enjoyed the fact that Ashitaka was consistent when it came to his moral compass, but the arcs of any of the characters are almost non-existent. There are both scare and suspenseful moments followed by sweet moments that are really enjoyable. I guess the visuals and the universe Miyazaki created is what makes this movie so special. Unfortunately I did not every connect with any of the characters. I think he does a better job with delivering his message with other movies without it being so in your face. It is a great movie, but I do not think it deserves classic status. The middle of the movie was slow because of the characters, but it was really book ended with some truly great and memorable moments. The last big action set piece is one of a kind and I would have thought he would have never topped it if I had not seen Ponyo.",8,1,3,17 August 2010
The Simpsons Movie," thumbs up
","From a huge Simpsons fan I would recommend this movie. It was funny and there was plenty of all the humor that we come to expect from the Simpsons. There were plenty of cameos from old characters that you could barely be seen as a camera passed through a crowd, but a lot of people show up. It was basically just a really long episode, but much funnier and more time for stupidity from Homer and a lot more room for jokes. I also would tell people to stay for the credits. A few moments were ruined a little bit by the previews, but not to the level where it ruins it at all. There is not much to say about this movie except it is the Simpsons that we have grown to love back in all of their glory.",9,5,9,4 August 2007
