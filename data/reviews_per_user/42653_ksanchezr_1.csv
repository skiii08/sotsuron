The Perks of Being a Wallflower," The movie was about a young teen boy named Charlie who is naive. He writes to this person who is not mentioned ever in the whole movie.
","KARLAThe main characters are Charlie, Sam, and Patrick. I think the actors were very good throughout the whole movie. the y looked liked they really connected with the character they were playing. They looked really focused and it actually seemed like they were really living the moment.My favorite part was at the end where they are in the tunnel. I like that part because I feel like Charlie finally knows where he belongs and does not feel lost anymore. Also because I feel like in that part they really are connected with each other and they are finally living the moment being happy and proud.I think I liked the book more because it had more details and you definitely get stuck on to the characters. It's like if you were to be able to relate to their situation and actually know them as person. Also because since you get more detail in the book you can somewhat imagine the scenes better.On a scale of 1-5 I would give the movie a 4 because it didn't show much detail like the book. Overall the movie was good and engaging which i really liked.",8,1,2,30 March 2017
