First Man," Don't believe the triggered americans over a flag controversy
","This was a well made movie, structured as a blockbuster but managing a 90's indie vibe, which was much appreciated. The story wasn't so captivating in the beginning but succeeded at being compelling after the rocky start. 
Gosling portrayed the character quite well, although it's not his best performance (nor should it be). The supporting cast was on point, but again, nothing Oscar worthy.
Overall, it's a must see if you're into this subject; if not, you may find it somewhat lackluster.",Null,86,247,7 September 2018
Captain Marvel," It's a Bird...It's a Plane...Oh no, it's Brie Larson
","Terrible casting choice, mediocre movie, dull plot. It requires serious skills to produce such a mediocre movie.",2,52,106,7 March 2019
Captain Marvel," As superficial as Brie's mentality
","Mediocre, boring movie and a bad casting choice for this character. I hope she has less than 5 minutes in Endgame.",2,8,14,7 March 2019
Aquaman," If spectacle is what you want ...
","... then this film will deliver. Not so sure of those who say this is better than 'The Dark Knight', though. It's quite generic, but manages to be refreshing and new. Overall an entertaining addition in a year where most movies were garbage.",6,25,55,13 December 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," It's finally over
","This trilogy feels very disjointed, with no organic continuity whatsoever. Most decisions feel forced throughout, classic characters don't feel like themselves, fan service has gone from overwhelming (J.J. Abrams) to underwhelming (Rian Johnson). The lack of attention to detail and careful planning remains the final nail in the coffin of what once was one of the greatest cinematic franchises.Disney, give George Lucas his IP back and everyone will be happy.",2,28,51,19 December 2019
Bird Box," Americans and their taste in movies
","I watched this due to the stupid challenge I saw on the Internet and I don't know which one hurt my brain more.
This is not how you structure a movie, this is not how a normal person acts in the face of danger and this is not a movie for someone who respects good cinema.",1,9,15,8 January 2019
Justice League," An embarrassment
","Aside from Snyder's scenes, which feel like part of something bigger, this ended up being an attempt at making a movie.",3,2,11,16 December 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Promising start, but went downhill from there
","We didn't get Peter's origin in this one, not really, but we did get 5 other origin stories. The way they did it was underwhelming, even if they tried to adapt the comic book style to the big screen; it still felt out of place and the movie making fun of itself for doing it is no excuse.
We also got the newest trend in Hollywood: female Doc Ock, Gwen's hair and Miles with his soy smile. It kind of feels refreshing here and there, some individual aspects work, but overall this flick makes me want to never rewatch it.",4,22,79,16 December 2018
Avengers: Endgame," A love letter to the MCU, but a weak movie
","From a fans' perspective, this has a lot of rewatchability value, but the plot holes bring down the whole franchise retrospectively. The directors took some creative choices that, for the most part, paid out, but watching this movie after the others in this franchise is a let down. Some heroes act out of character and although I felt the tension in the first couple of acts, the third one really didn't do nothing for me.
Infinity War was better constructed, but this had more heart.",5,5,8,8 June 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," A non-movie
","It took me some time to watch this. Overall a good experience but this is not a film in the traditional sense...Sure, it's overwhelmed with liberal preaching and awesome action, but at the end of the day, it's more of a filler. Cheap thrills don't work on me, sorry, not sorry.",5,4,10,30 November 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A mediocre flick
","I was not immersed at all in this movie. It's drawn out, boring and feels like Tarantino lost a bet and had to direct this one.If you fell for it, take out the director and the main cast and see if you'd still enjoy it.",4,2,7,20 August 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," What is this crap?
","A flick full of character misrepresentations, where the lore is ruined and nothing makes sense. Its sole purpose was to push an agenda.",2,22,30,30 December 2018
Midsommar," If critics would've given it bad reviews, you'd also be more objective
","I am constantly searching for modern horror movies, I've enjoyed some of them (The VVitch, The Babadook, It Follows), but this is just trash. I'm sure people will try to find symbolism in the setting, clothes, what they eat in the movie etc., but it's just a bad movie.
I get it that art is subjective, but as a movie this is beyond dumb.",3,6,11,29 September 2019
Joker," Masterpiece
","Truly gripping from start to finish, filled with layers and depth, Joker is the best movie I've seen in a very long time. It's basically the Breaking Bad of movies.",10,1,1,5 October 2019
Black Panther," Just no.
","Apart for the current MCU fever and the political climate, I don't get why this movie gets this much praise.
With lackluster CGI, a lot of continuity errors and character inconsistencies, this movie wouldn't stand out in any other decade. 
There are better movies that touch on the african culture (Tsotsi, Hotel Rwanda), better action movies (most MCU movies, the recent Mission Impossible ones) and more compelling portrayals of heroism that touch on the minority aspect of society (Boyz n the Hood, Dope) that don't require fantasy elements.
The villain was better than in most previous MCU movies, but the writers still didn't give him anything with gravitas, for T'Challa to rise to the challenge in a memorable way.
If we weren't living in a society that imposes race as a stand-alone quality of a person, this movie would've been forgotten in a couple of weeks.",2,2,6,7 September 2018
