The Blair Witch Project," Better the first time I saw it as 'The Last Broadcast.'
","Blairwitch contained elements and techniques that forged new territory, breathing life into mundane hollywood creating an exciting and original experience(well sort of.) One aspect that stands out is the gritty sense of realism. The use of a documentary as a foundation protrays a first person perspective engulfing the viewer as a participant. The interviews and narration all contributed to what appeared to be genuine footage. The frustration, anger, tension, and fear expressed by the three avid film makers seemed unscripted in real-life fashion, unlike most typical hollywood features where the characters are almost always cool, calm, collective under any situation.Another perspective used was the fear of vulnerability. Anticipation, darkness, and fear of the unknown are much more stimulating, creating an atmosphere of intensity, then that which we can see and comprehend. Sometimes it is the boundless realms of our imagination that is more disturbing and intriguing then special effects.Another technique used which i truly enjoyed (much to the dismay of others) was terminal climax(ending the movie suddenly at the climatic point.) This atypical style was perfected in writing by one of the greatest horror writers of all time H.P. Lovecraft. The rush cut abruptly short creates a more emotional impact and drain. Another well known lovecraftian style used was 'open interpretation' at the end where you are left to draw your own conclusions instead of having everything spelled out for you, making for a more personal viewing experience. Also how the story was created from myth was interesting, but still another H.P. trademark.Though on the surface this film looks innovative in every way, it is sad to say it was heavily borrowed from 'The Last Broadcast' which was done several years earlier and better. For the record, the directors of blairwitch later admitted to knowing of the movie but claimed never seen it.Judge for yourself, see both or save the cost of a rental and just see The Last Broadcast. The similarities are more eerie then the movies.",Null,0,1,18 January 2000
Fight Club," Truly the best movie you never saw....
","First don't be fooled by the title which limited its widespread appeal to a truer audience, its merely used as a backdrop. Second don't be persuaded by previous ignorant comments that state this movie has no basis or message to deliver. Fight club is ingenious in delivery and concept leading you on a bizarre and twisted psychological journey. It is wonderfully crafted, maybe to much so for the average dullard viewer and reminds me in nature of another great flick THX-1138. It follows a man entrapped by materialistic desires suffering from insomnia despising what his life has become. He can only find comfort and sleep in the connection of those less fortunate then himself in self-help groups to ease his burdens. Until he meets her. He soon discovers feelings for a woman and sorrow in the death of a friend which previous eluded him being blinded by his materialistic greed. His journey takes him through a dark thou enlightning journey or transformation.The presentation along with the twisted turn of events at the end make this movie much deeper then originally given credit for. Bradd Pitt and Edward Norton deliver nothing less then spectacular acting creating characters as equally dark and disturbing as your worst nightmare. This is one movie that gets better with every viewing and more easily understood. I watched in 5x in one weekend and became more and more engrossed with every viewing. Director David Fincher, director of seven, and the game has outdone himself with this one delivering a fantastic outing with intriguing concepts such as the use of subliminal pictures used in the movie and used as a small role in the movie. There are several, most notable comes at the very end.As Tyler sez,'how much can you truly know about yourself if you've never been in a fight.' You'll be amazed at the small things that make this movie a cutting edge masterpiece of inquisitive nature. Break the rules and tell everyone about Fight Club.",10,0,1,20 June 2000
