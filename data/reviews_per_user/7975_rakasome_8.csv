First Man," Could NOT Focus!!
","1. I guess the 'new' look in cinematography is the herky-jerky hand held camera. Puke!
2. I'm guessing 90% of the film were head shots from the collarbone up. Puke.
3. Neil Armstrong was NOT the morose, unsmiling astronaut as depicted. He was amongst a group of chosen men that were hard living, driven, and fun loving.
4. Ryan Gosling was SO WRONG in this role. SO WRONG.",2,12,19,3 November 2018
The Polar Express," The 3D Experience!!! Wow!!!!!
","Seeing the movie in 3D IMAX was simply amazing. It turned an ordinary, probably not very likely to see movie, into a totally new experience. You are constantly moving your head all over the screen to try and take it all in. At one point, you felt the train was going out across the theater and stopping overhead. Audible gasps from the attending crowd were riddled throughout the screening. This is an event worth looking into. The only drawback was wearing the IMAX headgear for the feature length film. It sat fairly well on the head, but would slowly droop down to your nose. Simple paper glasses would have been a much better idea. Still, it's worth the pain. WOW!!",9,1,4,30 November 2004
Elf," Another dud for another SNL alumni.
","Minimal hoots, rare chortles, and infrequent smiles made 97 minutes a real yawner.  James Caan was totally miscast and brought nothing to his role. Will Ferrell is a funny guy but has used up his character in previous roles. Time to move on Will....",3,7,23,10 November 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Oh Puh-leeze.......
","Yes, it was pretty.  Yes, I've read ALL the JRR stuff.  I'm 51 years old and all the books were required reading for my set.  But by the time the 90 minute mark had arrived, I either needed to get a pillow or get up and go browse Home Depot.  Home Depot won.Hard to understand much of the dialog, but THAT in itself was not the problem.  In fact, I'm not quite sure what the problem was.  But I was BORED TO TEARS.The acting was grand, to be sure.  New Zealand was spectacular.  Liv Tyler is a looker.  Incredible details on the sets.  I give up.What a yawner.  I predict VERY LITTLE Academy recognition.I apologize to all of you 'junkies.'",3,1,2,18 February 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Ho Hum.
",What would this movie have been like if they had hired actors?I was pleased to see the success of the director in making a boring book into an exact copy for the big screen.  A beautiful piece of film awash in time consuming special effects.,3,1,3,14 September 2002
Dunkirk," No Characters, No Plot, Disjointed.
","Viewed 08/04/17Just left the theater wondering what I just saw.There was NO character development. I did not of cared about them. When a character did speak, they were mumbling or the effects drowned out what they were saying.Time was artsy-fartsy jumping from night to day.Ships that should have been loaded with humans barely had anyone standing on the rail.Large explosions in the water with no smoke.One character says there are 400,000 men trapped. Then a shot of the beach shows maybe 1,000. Maybe.TERRIBLE ending.Brannagh should have laughed this one off.The director/writer is obviously quite full of himself.Dunkirk will show up on 'Best Of' lists. What a shame.",4,13,21,4 August 2017
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Could Have Been 40 Minutes Shorter....
","An OK movie.  Nothing fabulous except maybe for the spiders.I was hoping for a little more depth, but the film remained in the shallow end.Are you, too, tired of the Hogwarts setting?  What's going to happen when the actors get changed?  Let's leave the fun to the two films and move on....no more.",6,0,1,7 December 2002
Inception," Character Development? Bleech!!!
","What on earth has happened to character development in cinema? I was pretty pumped to see Inception. It looked flashy, decent actors, and what appeared to actually be a new idea for a plot (I'm REAL tired of rehashed plots).You were thrown into the film with characters that had NO basis of who they were. I didn't have a chance to decide if I liked a character through who they were. Lead actor played his usual flat self. He reminds me of the Al Pacino school of acting graduate. I didn't care anything about him or his 'team'.There were so stinkin' many visual flaws, goofs, and editing mistakes I lost count of which ones I would start with after the movie.The best thing about this movie is that I had a free pass given to me by my boss!",1,17,32,3 August 2010
