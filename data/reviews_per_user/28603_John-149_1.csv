The Rock," One of the best action-movies of all time
","I saw this movie in a cinema, thinking it would be just another mindless action, but I sure was wrong about that! Cause of the good actors, I had my hopes up for something a little bit over average. I wasn´t prepared at all for greatness of this sort. The soundtrack is one of the best that I has ever heard (especially during the beginning and during the climax in the end of the movie), the acting is fantastic (why does the Academy totally overlook action-movies?).The movie is Bruckheimer´s best so far! It should have been seen at a cinema. I´m very sorry to see that it fell of the top 250-list.",10,3,5,8 September 1998
