Requiem for a Dream," A harrowing but essential movie
","After watching this movie I felt sick in the stomach. 'Requiem for a Dream' is a story of four people, whose lives are dominated by substance addiction. The film offers no hope or optimism for a society where drugs are a sad but prevalent fact of life. It serves as a reminder of the lengths of depravity and indignity the afflicted are willing to sink to, for no apparent reason other than to feed their dangerous addictions and to get their 'fix'. Anorofksy's real contribution to the film is the way in which he captures the protagonists' descent into madness. The final frenetic montage which closes the film remains to be one of the most powerful and moving set of images I have ever seen on a screen. It captures the horrific sense of indignity and desolation that has irrevocably destroyed the lives of the characters involved.I usually take movies for what they are: leisurely entertainment. However this movie had such an affect on me that I honestly felt like reaching out and violently shaking the four characters involved. I too was gripped by a feeling of helplessness, desperately wanting to see some sort of rehabilitation or renewal take place for the poor souls in this movie. This movie, while not for everybody will kick you in the guts. It is an experience which will leave you angry, shaken and saddened, while also spectacularly impressed.",10,1,2,8 January 2007
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," At last a film true to the book
","In the past I have dreaded each release of the Potter films and have dragged myself to see the latest instalment. Finally with 'HP and the Order of the Phoenix' we have a film adaptation as true to the book as possible, and a film which in some way captures the imagination, like the books do. Perhaps my expectations of previous films were too high, but this flick really stuns you from start to finish and is not overacted, not trivialised and not childish in the same the previous films were. Brave Mr Yates for finally fulfilling the potential of a Harry Potter film.9/10",9,0,0,20 July 2007
