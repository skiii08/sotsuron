Casablanca," No movie is perfect, but...
","I am going to be straight on one thing. I was born 1989, almost 50 years since this movie had its premiere, but it wasn't until the year of 2006 I first watched this movie. Of course I had noticed all the good stuff that had been written about this film so I was excited, indeed.I watched the movie and I did like it. A lot. What makes 'Casablanca' so good you might ask? Well, there are a few things such as good pictures, excellent actors and of course the unforgettable dialogs.So is this film overrated like I thought it was? No, not at all. To say that 'Casablanca' is the best movie of all-time is wrong, because there is no such thing. However, 'Casablanca' is darn close.Play it once, Sam.",9,1,3,14 May 2006
Lost in Translation," Good, but not the best
","'Lost in Translation' is indeed a good movie, end of discussion. It's funny and of course well-done. Bill Murray is also a very good actor and together with Scarlett Johansson they make a memorable couple.However, I don't think it's one of the best. Not at all. Sometimes I think the movie is much too long and I was not very satisfied with the movie's ending. But, let's remember, some people like it and some don't.So will 'Lost in Translation' be remembered as a classic? A few movie enthusiasts will, as always, remember it for being popular in the beginning of the 21st century. But a classic, generally? No.7 out of 10.",7,1,3,15 May 2006
Million Dollar Baby," Highly respected actors
","I did not know a lot about this movie until I had actually seen it. I knew it starred Eastwood and Freeman and that it had won many Oscars. Boy, was excited. Then it hit me - what a brilliant movie! From its first minutes to the very last scene I was stunned.The narrator is, and may I say 'of course', Mr. Morgan Freeman - one of my favorite actors. He has an excellent voice does a very good job as the narrator as well as the former boxer Eddie. 'Million Dollar Baby' is directed by Mr. Clint Eastwood I haven't seen any of his movies before so to me, this was a nice experience.'Million Dollar Baby' is a touching story and very well-done which makes it to one of the best movies of this decade. Strongly recommended regardless you're a boxing fan or not.8 out of 10.",8,2,3,14 May 2006
Life Is Beautiful," Emotional film about a tragical issue
","All right, firstly, I 'never' give 10 points to a movie unless it has really touched my heart. When I think I about it, I have never given any movie 10 / 10, because when it is really good I give an eight or a nine. Anyways, 'La vita é bella' is the greatest movie I have ever seen.In my days I have seen a few movies but I have never cried, I mean, I just don't cry. But when I watched 'La Vita é bella' something changed - I cried for the first time for many years. I mean, we have all gone to school and we all know what happened in Europe in the 1930's to 1940's. We do know all the MILLIONS of people whose life's where sadly lost but do not understand because it's too big.In 'La Vita é bella' we get to know this sweet Jewish man and the problems that existed in the society in which he lived. Everything changed when he manged to get himself a family and the day when the Nazis came it was very emotional. In a matter of fact, there were many scenes in the movie which were touched me emotionally.Long live 'La Vita é bella' and long live humanity!",10,1,3,14 December 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," Deep movie about hope
","I had nothing to do the other night so I thought - hey, I feel like watching a good (and boy did I mean GOOD) movie. So I browsed the IMDb to see what I could find. 'The Shawshank Redemption' was one of only two movies which had more than 9/10 on average. I decided to watch this 2 hour long piece of work.The audience is brought in to the movie at once, something which I really appreciate in movies. In 'The Shawshank Redemption' you will follow Andy who was convicted for the murderer of his wife and her lover. It appears that Andy is innocent so in jail (named Shawshank) a struggle to become free again is started.'The Shawshank Redemption' is deep, funny and very smart. It brings up many messages about hope, friendship and fear. I strongly recommend you devote 2 hours of your life for this movie.9 out 10.",9,0,0,14 May 2006
The Silence of the Lambs," Psychological thriller I will never forget
","I do not believe there are movies which are perfect, but some are close. 'The Silence of the Lambs' is damn close.I like every second of this movie and that never happens to me when I watch movies. There are always scenes which could have been better or just thrown away. This is where 'The Silence of the Lambs' is different, here you can definitely talk about quality and not quantity.The main reasons, in my opinion, for the success of this movie are; the excellent light- and sound effects, the psychological manuscript and the professional actors such as Jodie Foster (Clarice Starling) and Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal Lecter).'The Silence of Lambs' did not, in any way, scare me physically but psychologically and that's why I believe this one of the best.",8,1,1,1 January 2006
