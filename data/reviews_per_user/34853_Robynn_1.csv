The Blair Witch Project," Frightened and Fascinated..
","I got to see a free preview screening of this film last night just by chance and I'm so glad that I got the opportunity..what a film!  I had heard a bit about the premise beforehand, but it didn't prepare me for the feeling that I left the theater with.  Even as I'm writing this, I still feel a bit of remorse that I have witnessed something brutal, strange and horrific. After reading the standard film disclaimer that reminded me that any similarities to persons living or dead are coincidental..I was still really shaken.In an era of re-makes and sequels this is a truly original film that I plan to drag all of my friends to this summer.",Null,1,2,24 June 1999
