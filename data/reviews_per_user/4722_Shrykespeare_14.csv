Mission: Impossible III," Not as bad as everybody thinks
","As action movie franchises go, MI has had its ups and downs. If you were to compare it to the most successful 'pure action' franchise ever, the Die Hard movies, it doesn't hold a candle. In those, the writing is better, the dialogue is better, the hero is easier to identify with, and the action is just as intense. Which is not to say that MI has done badly, but just like with Die Hard, you know going in what you are going to get: great action sequences, an interesting villain and a predictable ending.But the problem with MI1 was that the plot was too convoluted (it took several viewings to really suss it out), and the problem with MI2 was that the action sequences were used as a crutch to make up for a really lame story (typical John Woo, in other words... and really, has Anthony Hopkins ever been completely wasted in a role like this?).Now, keeping all this in mind, MI3 really does hold up as the best of the three. The action sequences are very good, the acting is better than usual and the storyline is the most entertaining of the three. We can easily follow what's going on without getting a headache, which is always nice in a 'pure action' movie. It's what makes many of the Bond movies entertaining, as well.It could be that many people have ragged on this movie simply because they don't like Tom Cruise. With all the hoopla surrounding his personal life of late, it's hard to watch his movies with a detached eye. But his performance in MI3 is no better or worse than the other two, with enough convincing requisite emotion given how the bad guy attacks him in the most personal way. I neither love nor hate the guy, just as I neither love nor hate Ethan Hunt, his character. We root for him, sure, but we know he's going to win in the end, so whatever.If you are reading this review trying to decide whether or not to see the movie, I'll level with you. This is a very good movie. Tense, taut, and full of adrenaline. In other words, your typical summer blockbuster. It's certainly not the best action movie ever made, but if this ends up being the last MI movie, at least it went out on a positive note.My score: 9/10.",9,1,1,9 June 2006
Deja Vu," I was glued to my seat!
","You see the name Denzel Washington, you know you're going to get a well-acted lead character. You see the name Jerry Bruckheimer, you know you're going to get a boatload of action. You see the name Tony Scott, you know you're going to get one hell of a story.With this recipe, Deja Vu delivered as promised. A taut, tense thriller that I couldn't take my eyes off for a second. Intelligent, visceral, practically vibrating with tension, this film starts with a bang (pun intended) and ends with, ironically the very same bang! In between, you get a well-written story, full of crisp dialogue and plenty of humor, balanced equally with a full measure of action. (NOTE: This movie contains one of the most UNIQUE chase scenes of all time.) We don't know how it will end, as the age-old question rears its head: can one change the past? One of the best movies of the year. 9 out of 10.",9,4,8,26 November 2006
Unbreakable," M. Night's best (contains spoilers)
","'Unbreakable' is one of those films that garners extreme reactions on both ends of the spectrum; either people love it or hate it.The biggest criticism is that the movie is too long and too slow to develop, which is certainly a understandable argument.  I prefer to look at M. Night's films in a different light; I admire the way that he absolutely refuses to rush through a story, and the way that he lets the characters develop at their own pace.  Bruce Willis's slow, gradual transformation is a beautiful thing to watch, a testament to Bruce's incredible talent.  The aura of sadness that he projects through most of the movie is tangible, and it's only through the teachings (or manipulation, if you will) of Samuel L. Jackson's character, Elijah, that Bruce's character, David, is able to finally realize his full potential, to understand his place in the world, and to connect with his son in a way he never could before.I would also like to give special kudos to Spencer Clark's performance as David's son, Joseph.  Most kids, especially those not close to their parents, have no understanding of what their parents do for a living.  It's more comfortable to live a fantasy, where your Dad is a superhero and you will one day follow in his footsteps.  It's no wonder that when the possibility presents itself that David is special, Joseph latches onto that notion, and proceeds to stop at nothing to prove it to his father, even coming a hair's-breadth from shooting him.David's first adventure as a superhero was magnificently done.  He walks into a train station, bustling with people, and lets his instincts take over.  Just by touching people, he can see what terrible things they've done (kind of like John Smith on USA's 'The Dead Zone', but not as extreme), for example, shoplifting, race violence, and date rape.  But when he brushes up against a man who had committed cold-blooded murder, David leaps into action.  He follows the man to a house he has taken over - both parents are dead, but the two children are still alive.  The confrontation is also very well done.  No words are spoken; there is no flurry of blows or martial arts moves; simply one man taking another man down in a way that any of us might do in similar circumstances.The next morning, David shows his son a newspaper detailing the incident. He silently mouths the words 'You were right', and his son sheds a tear of joy; his fantasy has been fulfilled, and his connection to his father can only get stronger from here on out.  They also agree to keep his double life secret from David's wife, which is another nice touch.Given Elijah's life and state of mind, it is very reasonable to understand his motives for wanting to find someone like David.  That he used such reprehensible methods for doing so makes the ending that much more shocking.Most people, especially moviegoers, are easily bored.  They are addicted to the quick fix, where something dramatic or exciting has to happen every five minutes or they lose interest.  That is why 'Unbreakable' has elicited such negative praise from some critics.  But I am of the opinion that if the view at the top is spectacular enough, it's doesn't matter how long it takes to get up the mountain.My score: 10.",10,34,52,26 July 2004
LÃ©on: The Professional," Simply Brilliant
","Where to begin?I put Natalie Portman's performance in this movie alongside Haley Joel Osment's in The Sixth Sense as one of the best acting jobs by a preteen in any movie, ever. The reason is this: when a child has a lead role in a movie that he/she would not be old enough to see in a theater, you know that it would take a superior performance to truly stand out. And Natalie does not disappoint.*SPOILERS AHEAD*One scene says it all - she returns from the grocery to find her family massacred and the cops who did it still there. Trying not to show how visibly shaken he is, she keeps walking to Leon's door as if it's her own, and her plaintive whimpering for him to let her in nearly made my heart rip in two.Until that moment, Leon had the luxury of keeping the rest of the world outside his door, not getting involved in anyone's life (except to kill them). Initially, he is resistant to having this young waif invading his comfort zone; he even contemplates killing her while she slept! But we know that Leon, like the rest of us, will fall under Mathilda's spell; she's too beautiful, too alone and too in need of a protector for Leon not to fall in love with her.Much has been made about Luc Besson's using a 12-year-old girl as a sexual icon, but that's subject to broad interpretation in my opinion. Twelve is precisely the age that most young girls discover their ability to draw the eyes of men (of ANY age), and I applaud Mr. Besson for embracing that fact instead of acquiescing to the vagaries of political correctness. Is 'Lolita' a great work of literature or simply child pornography? Girls that age have always been, and will always be, desired by older men. Call it what you will: reprehensible, disgusting, perverted; but that doesn't make it less true.Gary Oldman has built his career on playing villains, and few play them as well as he. Whether a scene calls for him to be quietly menacing or deliciously over-the-top, he can do it. The Professional, Dracula, Hannibal, The Fifth Element... he brings a dramatic flair to his bad guys that makes him stand apart from many who play movie villains.I don't know what substance it was that Gary's character took (perhaps someone will tell me?), but whatever it was, it set him into an altered state of consciousness wherein killing an entire family was akin to conducting a symphony orchestra. And hearing him scream 'EVERYYYYONNNEEEEE!!!' sent chills up my spine!And last but not least, Jean Reno as Leon, the title character, was perfectly done. Speaking English with a thick enough accent that we were JUST able to understand what he was saying, Jean was able to infuse a depth of character into Leon with seemingly very little effort. Mathilde, in a very short time, transforms Leon from cold remorseless killer into a valiant avenging angel. We want so badly for them to make that daring escape and have that happy ending that they deserve, but we all know deep down that it just wasn't going to happen.In the final scene, when Mathilde replants Leon's beloved potted plant in the yard of her boarding school, we are left with such a sense of not only happiness but sadness as well, which is accentuated by the haunting strains of Sting's 'Shape of My Heart', the perfect ending to a fabulous movie.My score: 10.",10,3,5,2 June 2004
"I, Robot"," Much Better Than I Thought (may contain spoilers)
","I went to 'I, Robot' simply because I was bored and needed something to do on a Saturday. I was expecting a flick where I was reasonably entertained for two hours, but one that I would probably stick in the 'good, not great' bin, which is where so much of the summer movies eventually end up. What I got, however, was an engaging film that managed to maintain my interest and full attention all the way through.Will Smith is a bonafide movie star. His screen presence and wry wit make him a marketable asset that will continue to land starring roles for years to come. (My God, has he always been that buff??) He was good in Independence Day, very good in Men In Black, and exceptional here.I was also impressed with the plot. In today's world, where we have become increasingly dependent on machines, and probably will continue to do so, this film did a great job outlining a future society in which mankind's dependence has reached its highest possible level. The unconditional belief and trust in the '3 Laws' has blinded mankind to the fact that one unscrupulous machine with delusions of grandeur can bring the whole system crashing down.I doubt that robots, like the ones seen in this movie, will be mass-marketed in my lifetime. However, if I was to ever have one in my home, I would not want it to look human. Manufacturers try their best to make machines as 'user-friendly' as possible, so that we will more readily accept them. In the future, that may mean giving them a human face, and as close a thing to human emotions and idiosyncracies as technology has come up with. The problem is, technology, ALL technology, is subject to malfunctions. And the larger the scope, the larger the failure. And this movie did a great job illustrating that when a society's dependence on technology has surpassed its ability to cope with such a failure, it's all the more terrifying.At first, it look like the robot, Sonny, was going to be the antagonist for Will Smith's technology-shunning cop. But gradually, his 'character' makes the transition from adversary to ally, eliciting genuine sympathy when it looks like his quest to more thoroughly understand his emotions will be quashed. (Note: Watch the Star Trek: Next Generation episode 'Measure of a Man', for a similar storyline.)I sincerely hope this movie does not spawn a sequel. A large part of the allure of fantasy and sci-fi is the ability for us to ask ourselves 'What if...?' At the end of this movie, when mankind's self-imposed veil of ignorance has been shattered, one is left to wonder where the world would go from there. No definitive answers, just more questions. But sci-fi stories like this one don't need to have a definitive ending. We viewers don't need to have everything wrapped up in a big red bow. The future is uncertain... that's why it's the future! Closure is not necessary, because it's not possible.This movie did not even come close to rivaling 'Spider-Man 2' or 'Shrek 2' in total box office gross, but I have to admit that I enjoyed 'I, Robot' just as much, if not more. My score: 10/10.",10,6,8,21 July 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Better, Worse... Or Just Different?
","I am a little ambivalent when I think about how this movie affected me. I left the theater having not enjoyed myself nearly as much as the first two, that's for sure... but there was a lot to enjoy about the movie anyway.Let me start by saying that I have not read any of the books; take that in any way you want.If I didn't already know that there was a different director this time out, it would have been apparent immediately. Chris Columbus did such a magnificent job of translating the first two books to the screen that I expected something very similar here, but that's not the impression POA left on me.The whole tone of the story was so much darker and scarier than the first two stories, I wasn't sure how to react: it wasn't really scary enough to be called a 'scary' movie, but it was also not 'fun' enough to really call it enjoyable. Maybe that was the point, because I've been told that the books are the same way.Let me list the things that I enjoyed the most:1. The acting jobs of Daniel, Rupert and Emma. Those three have become the embodiment of their characters, so much so that I hope they won't be typecast once the HP movies are over and done with.2. Alan Rickman as Prof. Snape. He exudes arrogance and disdain but I am convinced deep down he feels admiration and protective of Harry. I have a feeling that something big will brew between them down the line.3. The overall atmosphere at Hogwart's. This is a place where supernatural and otherworldly things happen hourly, but until now the place has seemed like a funfair haunted house. Kudos to Cuaron for doing that, although I did miss John Cleese's character!4. The Dementors - a truly scary sight, and well realized.What I didn't like:1. What made the first two movies 'fun' were the parts that could be described as 'kid stuff' - the innocence and inexperience with doing magic, the Quiddich matches, etc. All of that was missing here. Yes, I know the kids are older and more experienced, but they are STILL KIDS. Emma Thompson's character said it best when she told Hermione that she had the heart of an old maid (or words to that effect). Kids are most enjoyable to watch when they having FUN being kids. Even the Quiddich match in this movie was dreary, an extension of the seriousness of the plot rather than a break from it.2. Michael Gambon as Dumbledore - granted, stepping into Richard Harris's shoes is a very tall order (no pun intended), and I have nothing against Michael as an actor, but I have come to think of Dumbledore as a warm, charming, kindly character, rather like Santa Claus with magical powers. Michael tried his best to pull it off, but some of the warmth was just missing.3. The omittance of Maggie Smith's character - it was her matronly demeanor, so typical of schoolmarms the world over, that added such as sense of believability to the first two movies. In this movie, she was practically a non-entity. Let's get this straight; Maggie Smith is a classically-trained, experienced actress with an acting resume that stretches back decades, and I applaud whoever convinced here to play this role, and keep playing it. Again, maybe her diminished role in this movie was in keeping with the book, which I haven't read, but I was very disappointed in her absence.4. The 'Defense Against the Dark Arts' Teacher - three movies, three teachers, with yet another one coming in the fourth installment. It's almost become a running joke that whoever takes the position will not last the movie, rather like the drummers in Spinal Tap!I don't know in what direction this series is headed; the fourth installment, 'The Goblet of Fire', is being filmed as we speak and will probably be released next summer. I am glad that they handed the reins over to Mike Newell, a veteran director with a proved track record for hits. For those who don't know, he has directed such films as 'Four Weddings and a Funeral,' 'Mona Lisa Smile', 'Enchanted April', and going further back, the 'Young Indiana Jones Chronicles' on TV. I think that this is an excellent choice - I am hoping that he can infuse some of the 'fun' back into the series without taking away from the more serious overtones of it.Just as we enjoy kids grow up on TV, I too enjoy watching these kids grow up on the screen. Next time out, I understand that for the first time there will be romantic interests for both Harry and Hermione. In Harry's case, it will be with an Asian character whose name I don't know; the actress playing her will be a complete unknown, which is just what the director wanted. As for Hermione, maybe she'll hook up with Ron - if she and Harry are not going to become involved, Ron would be the next best choice! The other supporting kids probably won't change their characters much; Neville will still be a bit of a weenie, Draco will be an arrogant prick, etc.For those reading this who skipped over the body of this review and are only reading the final line, I'll just say this - if you are a stalwart Harry Potter fan, you must see this movie. If you enjoy fantasy movies where kids are the stars, you should see this movie. But if you go expecting the same kind of movie as the first two, you will be disappointed.My score: 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,8 June 2004
The Usual Suspects," One of the best crime dramas EVER
","A poll in Entertainment Weekly magazine a couple of years ago listed, among other things, the Top 10 movies to watch over and over. The Usual Suspects came in 2nd, right behind The Shawshank Redemption. And that says it all... this is a movie that can be watched over and over again. Even if you've seen the ending dozens of times, you like to pretend that you're watching it for the first time. It's just that good.The first time I ever saw this movie was on cable in the early part of the evening. I was so floored by the way the movie ended, I went out and rented it, and watched it again that very night. As a veteran film-goer, I can think of no other movie that has affected me like this.I watch this film now and I wonder how this story would have been adapted to film had it been made in the days of B/W. Veteran crime drama actors like Bogart or Cagney could have slipped into these roles like a glove. It's not a stretch to imagine the type of dialogue or the score that was prevalent in crime dramas of the time; this story is a great mystery for any era.The acting in this film is absolutely first-rate. Spacey earns his well-deserved Oscar for his portrayal of Verbal Kint, a character so obviously deeper than the two-dimensional crippled crook that he PRETENDS to be. Gabriel Byrne's Dean Keaton, corrupt, ruthless and possessing a conscience that you need a microscope to see, still manages to SOMEHOW generate sympathy. Steven Baldwin? Who'd've thought that anyone associated with Bio-Dome had such a performance in him? The list goes on... Kevin Pollack, Benicio Del Toro, Chazz Palmintieri, and my personal favorite, Pete Postlethwaite as the enigmatic Kobayashi. (Side note: I love that not one person noticed or even commented on the fact that a British lawyer had a Japanese name, but that of course tied into the ending!)The atmosphere of the movie is tense and taut, like a great crime drama should be. The camera work is top-notch, and the score is absolutely perfect. The script is superb, rife with memorable lines and even more memorable characters. (I would have awarded McQuarrie the Oscar just for coming up with the name Keyser Soze; I mean, is that a great name for an omnipresent bad guy or what??)This film is the exception to many rules. Usually, a film dome mostly in flashbacks is lame and predictable... not this one. Films where the bad guy wins, which are rare, usually leave the viewer with a sour taste in their mouth... not this one. (Of course, when 95% of the characters in a movie are bad guys or, at the very least, people of questionable character, it's not hard to root for them! 'Payback' is another example.)I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone, even if they already know how the movie ends. If you've only seen it once, see it again. This is a movie that gets better with multiple viewings, not worse. I've lost count of how many times I've seen it, and it's taken it's place at the #1 spot of my favorite drama of all time.",10,1,2,27 May 2004
Hero," Been There, Done That
","Having seen both 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' and both 'Kill Bill' movies over the last two years, it's regrettable that acrobatic high-wire swordplay scenes don't impress me as much as they used to.I know going in to see 'Hero' that I would be comparing it to 'Crouching Tiger'; most of us who have seen both of these films have in common the fact that we are typical Westerners who don't see very many Asian films.  The comparison is inevitable, there simply is no other frame of reference.That being said, there's no denying the power of the drama that the plot of 'Hero' presented.  The pageantry, the scope and the depth of the characters justify the many foreign film awards it has won.  Add to that the fact that this is the most expensive movie ever produced in China, and you have a textbook definition of the work 'epic'.I would like to think that I am capable of seeing the forest for the trees when it comes to movies like this - which is to say, lift my preferences out of the slam-bang action flicks or lowbrow comedies that are the usual fare for summer audiences.  But the truth is, by the time 'Hero' went into its last half hour, I was bored.  Watching the same scenes play out from different perspectives got tiresome.  (But I will say that having the characters' outfits change color depending on the mood of the moment was a nice cinematic touch.)  The story line became a kind of Kurosawa-meets-Shakespeare plot of betrayal and assassination, and by the time the movie ended, I found myself not even caring which side won or who lived and died.Take my review for what it's worth - that of a average Joe who tried for two hours to raise his intellectual bar to a level where he could see where all the critics' four- and five-star ratings were coming from, but was ultimately unable to do it.  I have no doubt that many people will succeed where I failed, and they will no doubt enjoy this movie a lot more than I did.My score: 6/10.",3,0,1,31 August 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," An Absolute Classic
","If one did not know going in that this was a Tarantino movie, one would be able to discern that fact within five minutes. From the violence of the opening scene segueing to Nancy Sinatra's haunting 'Bang Bang', it would be obvious to all who know QT's work.Then we go right to a fight scene, where she dispatches the 2ND person on her 'Death List Five'; what a deliciously funny moment when both characters have to pause their knock-down, drag-out catfight because a school bus carrying Vernita's daughter pulls up right outside!Then we go back in time to the scene where the Bride wakes from her coma... and she exacts revenge on the orderly who had been pimping the coma patients for a few bucks! (Who but QT would throw something that perverse in just for laughs?) I remember the first time I saw that scene, when Buck is explaining 'the rules' to his would-be customer, I said aloud to the screen 'Boy, you picked the wrong girl on the wrong goddamn day!'The Anime segment detailing O-Ren's origins was a very nice touch... it's been said that this whole film is a live-action cartoon, and having actual animation within it seems apropos. From there we go to Okinawa, where the Bride acquires the services of a retired sword-maker, getting him to relinquish his vow to never create another instrument of death. This scene was a little overly long, but a wonderful precursor to the bloody scene that was to follow.And then, at last, the final third of the movie: The Showdown at the House of Blue Leaves. One of the best fight scenes ever filmed! Some may find it gratuitously violent, and rightly so, but people offended by such things should have known better than to go see a QT movie in the first place! Such people may also take note that the most gratuitous part of the fight scene switched to B/W, so as to tone down the bloodiness of it without detracting from it.My best friend, whose name was Larry, sadly, passed away in the year 2000. He was an avid moviegoer - he loved spaghetti westerns, he loved Asian martial-arts movies, and he loved QT. I look at this film and I know without a doubt that it would have made his list of all-time favorites, and it saddens me that he never got to see it.I must add that I was a little bit disappointed with KB2; though I didn't expect KB2 to be a carbon copy of KB1, it seemed to be lacking the campy spirit that KB1 had. QT's movies all have certain themes in common; violent action, wacky homages to his favorite genres, and memorable dialogue in the scenes that are purely for exposition. In my opinion, KB1 is an outstanding movie because it had all three of these qualities; KB2 is just okay because the exposition far outweighed the action.If gratuitous violence offends you, or if blood and gore makes you squeamish, then you should probably avoid this movie at all costs. If, on the other hand, you like exploring what I like to call 'the dark underbelly of film-making', which is the essence of QT's work, then you will love this movie, and want to watch it over and over again.My Score: An unqualified 10.",10,0,2,16 June 2004
Ice Age," 'We are definitely the weirdest tribe I've ever seen...'
","Ice Age was a very entertaining movie, with broad appeal for viewers mature and young. Right from the beginning, when we chuckle at Skrat's futile attempts to crack his prized acorn, we are hooked.The actors chosen to play the main characters' voices played their parts to the hilt, most notably John Leguizamo as the (extremely) goofy-looking but lovable sloth Sid. How could you not laugh at one of his opening lines... 'They migrated without me... they do this EVERY YEAR!!' Sid is joined by Manfred (Ray Romano) and Diego (Denis Leary) as three beasts very atypical of their species, and sure enough, they start to gel as a group when faced with the daunting task of returning a human baby to it's tribe after it's mother dies while fleeing a pack of saber-toothed tigers.I won't go into great detail about the rest of the story; it is not difficult to predict. The good guys win and there is a happy ending; but hey, this is an animated movie aimed at kids, what other kind of ending could there be? Still, putting that aside, the 75 minutes between start and end are extremely entertaining.My score: 9.",9,1,2,1 June 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Greatest Movie of All Time
","I figure I have paid to see roughly 500 different movies in theaters over the course of my lifetime, rented hundreds more, and seen a few thousand others on cable. And I can say this without hesitation: The Return of the King is the best movie I have ever seen, hands down.I won't give a long exposition about the plot, or how deserving it's Oscar sweep was; that's already been done by countless others before me. I will say, however, that if Peter Jackson never made another movie again after this, he will still be remembered 100 years from now.One of the most beloved and most-read series of books EVER, the LOTR trilogy was thought, many years ago, to be unfilmable; it was too long, too broad in scope. You'd have to cut so much out in order to tell the story. And at the time, it was true. But with movie effects and technology having progressed to the point it has, the time was right for the telling of this story. And, viewing the three movies as a whole, I wouldn't change one thing about it.There were changes or omissions from the original story, of course: the roles of the female characters, Arwyn and Eowyn, were hugely embellished for cinematic purposes; and the disappearance of Saruman from the 3rd installment is the only real niggle I have about the whole series. But I think that if JRR Tolkien had lived to see his work portrayed on the big screen, he would be more than satisfied with Jackson's work.Having read the books, I wondered just how much of the 'after' story would make it into the final cut. Again, they left a lot out, but when you have a movie that is already 3 1/2 hours long, I guess certain sacrifices must be made! Of course, part of me hoped that the movie would never end.... and I know that's a sentiment shared by many.It's weird to note that ROTK nabbed 11 Oscars without even a single nomination for acting. Many would say that the story's epic-ness and volume were on such a massive scale, that it became difficult for individual performances to stand out. And that is a shame. Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen and Elijah Wood all did such and incredible job infusing their characters with warmth and inner strength that they almost became members of our family while we were watching them.The word 'epic' is sometimes overused when it comes to movies. Any movie that incorporates thousands of extras, huge sets and big-budget effects these days could be called an 'epic', but only history will be the judge of how it will hold up. 'Titanic' was an epic, in every sense of the word. And for a year or two, it seemed to be the only movie that people saw, or talked about. But look at it now! Yes, it still stands as the #1 grossing movie of all time, a record that may stand for years to come. But it's already played itself out. Everyone has seen it, and few really have any desire to see it again. LOTR, the whole series, will not suffer the same fate. This movie will generate just as much positive buzz ten, twenty years from now as it does today. True, technology and computer effects will continue to grow, evolve and improve. There will be more 'epics'. But there will never, ever be another series like this one again.My score: an unqualified 10.",10,0,2,2 June 2004
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Funniest Movie Ever. Period. End of Story.
","Few movies in the history of movies inspire its fans to memorize every scene, every bit of dialogue, every microscopic nuance to be brought out later at social gatherings. Such is Monty Python and the Holy Grail.The Pythoners once said in an interview that when they wrote their characters, their scripts, it was NEVER about what they thought would make millions of people laugh. It was about what made the six of THEM laugh, and that is a fitting testament to Python's genius.John Cleese once commented that the British are a people who are desperate to be made fun of. When many people think of England, the first images most people the world over conjure up are either the horrible weather or the stuffed shirts that make up the aristocracy. The best British comedies through the years. Python, Benny Hill and the Black Adder series, to name a few, were all made immortal because they railed against the stiff, boring world they grew up in by displaying the wacky irreverence that made even the status quo laugh.The Knights Who Say 'Nee!' The French Taunter. The Castle Anthrax. The Rabbit. Lancelot's stint at Swamp Castle. 'Bring Out Your Dead.' The Bridge Keeper. You mention these things to people, and they instantly know what you mean, even if the name of the movie hasn't even come up! But even the smaller bits are worthy of remembrance: The Opening Credits. The Coconuts. The Witch Trial. Sir Robin's Minstrels. The old man clapping on the dungeon wall. The 10-second (PSYCH!) intermission. The Holy Hand Grenade. And the aptly named Sir-Not-Appearing-In-This-Film. The list goes on and on. Every second of this movie belongs in the Comedy Hall of Fame.I'd bet that his film is on more people's Top 10 Funniest Movies of All Time than any other. It has become a standard in the industry.'Strange women lying in ponds...' 'Bet you're gay!' 'No I'm not...' 'I got better...' '...silly English Knnnnnnniggets' 'Run Away! Run Away!' 'Well, perhaps I'll stay a BIT longer...' 'We want.... a shrubbery!!'10 out of 10.",10,4,6,2 June 2004
Shark Tale," Great for kids, but...
","Most animated movies are aimed specifically at kids or teenagers, as that is the age group that watches the most cartoons. Going to see 'Shark Tale,' I was hoping that even though my adolescent years are way behind me, I could still enjoy it on the same level that made me enjoy movies like 'Shrek 2' and 'Finding Nemo'.Mission not accomplished.For one thing, I wasn't a big fan of the animation. With the exception of the sharks, most of the characters were drawn as if someone just stuck a human face on a fish's body, complete with eyelids and squared-off teeth. It didn't look good to me, and that made me care about the characters less.The second thing was the story line, which ran about as deep as a puddle. The humor was too juvenile for me to find humor in, and the more adult side of the story, the 'mob' story, has been played out too many times for me in too many stories to peak my interest.If I were 20-25 years younger, I'm sure I would have enjoyed it a lot more. But, for me, 'Shark Tale' will get put into the file in my memory labeled 'Saw it once, won't see it again.'My score: 6 out of 10.P.S. Note to the writers: It's about a decade too late for M.C.

V for Vendetta," The First Truly Great Film of 2006
","I went to the theater expecting to either love this movie or hate it... such as it is with 'comic book' movies. Having heard all the 'terrorist-as-a-hero' arguments from both sides, and knowing going in that we would never see the protagonist of this film's face (but only the Guy Fawkes mask that he wears throughout), I was not convinced I would connect with the main characters sufficiently to recommend this movie to others.I am convinced now.The acting in this film is top-notch. Hugo Weaving, whose strident voice and incredible screen presence, which has been seen in such blockbusters as the 'Matrix' trilogy as well as the 'LOTR' trilogy, gives such a commanding performance that as V's emotions change, you can almost it registering on the blank facade of the mask he wears. Natalie Portman turns in another stellar performance as Evey, a vulnerable, terrified young woman who, with V's help, breaks through the shell of fear that the totalitarian government that England has become has created around her. The supporting cast is also outstanding: John Hurt as the vile, draconian Chancellor Sutler, Stephen Rea as the intuitive Inspector Finch, and Stephen Fry as Gordon, friend/father-figure to Evey and a local TV celebrity.This movie is also well-plotted and moves along at a crisp pace. The action sequences are well-choreographed, the 'explosions' are well-executed (and are more to lend an air of poignance to the mood of the film rather than to satisfy our need for such things), and the dialogue, while at times over the top, is well-scripted.But the best moments in the film involve the interaction between V and Evey. The parental love that he feels for her is obvious, even though at one point he has to result to some rather cruel tactics in order to ensure her loyalty to him.Does the movie end the way you think it's going to? Probably. Will that detract from your enjoyment of it? Not a whit. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone of teenage years and up (young children would probably find it too dark, and one fight scene is particularly gory).MINI-SPOILER There is one uproariously laugh-out-loud moment, which anyone who was a fan of the old 'Benny Hill Show' will recognize immediately.My score 10/10.",10,5,10,22 March 2006
