Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Well worth watching again.
","I would give this film a 7.5 out of 10, Tarantino has done a great job of volume 2 it's better than the first. There's a good balance of action, comedy and love, the action is much more believable than the first. The love is not too cheesy, and the fight scenes you can't help but laugh and shout ouch!!We learn the truth about the Bride, how she became so deadly, how she trained under Bill's Master Pai Mei (typical 70's kung fu grand master), I'd say is my favourite part of the film.Uma Thurman shows great acting skills, from fear, sadness joy and just being plain normal. One scene where it seems our heroine has finally met her doom is particularly well acted out its pretty convincing. David Carradine character Bill you almost feel sorry for, I quite liked the guy especially for the ending.Only two things I didn't like about the film, once she gets to Bill the movie does drag on a little, I think Tarantino saw this because he adds in a few surprises should u begin to fall asleep with all the talk. Samuel L Jackson's appearance is a black and white scene as the organ player for the wedding rehearsal, the room is quite dark and being black it is hard to see him, but saying that Tarantino doesn't concentrate much of Jackson's face during his conversations.Funniest scene for me was Budd's calendar scene and Pai Mei laughter whilst beard stroking; think you'll like it too.PS saw it yesterday as my brother works for a cinema company.",7,0,1,16 April 2004
