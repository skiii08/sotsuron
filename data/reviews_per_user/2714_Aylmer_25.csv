Alien 3," to coin a phrase, 'underrated'
","Yeah I know it's starting to become as cliché to defend this movie as it is to trash it, but for what it's worth I do enjoy watching this film from time to time and it always offers something new.Mainly the nice thing here is the atmosphere - nothing like a dark and miserable labyrinth of abandoned tunnels, foundries, and prison cells alone on a miserable inhospitable planet to really set the stage for a dystopian slaughterfest, is there? Add to that an impressive cast of unsung British character actors such as Charles Dance (GOOD MORNING BABYLON), the unspellable Pete Postlethwaite, Paul McGann, and Philip Davis (THE BOUNTY)... with the added bonus that they're all bald and dirty prisoners on a bleak prison planet. Throw in an alien to kill them all and what's not to love? Directorially, Fincher threw in a lot of good surprises along the way with lots of surprisingly well-handled action sequences with an appropriate mixture of suspense and gore. I particularly enjoyed seeing a few 'squished frame' shots and some strange staging where you don't quite know what to make of what you're looking at. There's some nice ambiguity thrown into many scenes, but never to the point where things get confusing.However, this film makes a lot of messy turns in its narrative. First off, there are just too many red herring scenes such as Newt's dissection and the bit with Ripley scouting around in the basement. They seem only to exist to pad out the running time. Secondly, it fails to really distinguish the prisoners or even solidly identify the fates of any of them during the chaotic action scenes. For instance, does anyone know what actually happens to the big guy with the meat cleaver? I've seen both versions and unfortunately they both suffer from a lot of the same problems. Overall I like the extended version as it provides a lot more insight into the life and society of the convicts, but then again the Oxen subplot is absolutely pointless.That 'pointless' word could actually apply to the movie itself, but taken for what it is and just enjoyed for a bleak outer space horror film, ALIEN 3 actually *can* be quite enjoyable.",7,3,65,20 March 2009
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A terrible travesty of a mockery of a sham
","This movie horribly destroyed any dignity left in the Star Wars series. From the absolutely flat dramatics, to the uneven performances, to the badly edited action scenes, this movie reeks of laziness.  I admit, there are a couple exciting sequences, some eye-popping visuals, and the light saber battles were well-choreographed, but on the whole the movie was dull and turgid.  The pacing was horrible, too fast to absorb at first and then when they get to Tatooine, it virtually slows to a halt.  Absolutely zero character development too, and Anakin was far too young to be believable. Good for kids and the idiotic masses plebes who enjoy cheap thrills.  The video game 'Jedi Knight' had cutscenes that seemed closer to authentic Star Wars adventure than this abysmal waste of time.  Try to resist the temptation, don't watch this film!  Show modern day filmmakers that they can't continue shelling out this garbage to the people of this country.",3,3,7,27 May 1999
Spartacus," Stanthony Mannbrick
","SPARTACUS is a solidly produced historical epic of the time, but unlike EL CID, BEN HUR, THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, or THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, it doesn't hold up as well under scrutiny. This may owe more to a poor script than Stanley Kubrick, who stepped in for original director Anthony Mann during the production due to a fight with Kirk Douglas. Had it been the other way around with Mann been kept on and Douglas fired, I doubt this CLEOPATRA-style grandiose-yet-awkward film would have suffered. Actually it might have been much better and more cohesive as too much feels as though the director lacked interest and most of the best scenes are more Mann-ish than Kubick-esquire.The film starts off traditionally enough – Spartacus is raised in the slave pits and makes a seamless transition to gladiator. Somewhere along the line he manages to figure out a sense of unbreakable moral virtue and never strays from it the rest of the film, thus making his character 1-dimensional and unfortunately pretty boring. Despite all this, the film is fine up until the standout slave break-out scene where Spartacus begins his rebellion and our plot lines diverge. The film then cuts back and forth from following Spartacus's army to the political rivalry between Laurence Olivier and Charles Laughton as Roman senators looking to profit from the whole mess. It turns out that these extremely charismatic villains are much more interesting to watch than bland Kirk Douglas, who is completely overshadowed with his 'subdued Heston' performance and Christ-like central character.The film does highly benefit from many colorful supporting characters and great performances. Some highlights include: Peter Ustinov as a stressed-out slave trader, Woody Strode as a stoic gladiator who snaps, Herbert Lom as a Phoenician pirate (!), and Charles McGraw as a hateful veteran gladiator/instructor. John Ireland and Tony Curtis don't get to do much as Spartacus's right and left hand, though Curtis has a disturbing yet slightly amusing scene where Olivier (extremely well-dubbed by Anthony Hopkins for the reissue) attempts to seduce him. Jean Simmons (no, not one from 'KISS') is quite restrained and bland as Douglas's love interest, though she isn't really given much to do either.Usually epics like this are redeemed by massive battle scenes but (despite some heavy gore for the time) the big show-stopping fight is not the best of the genre, owing some to Alex North's pedestrian score and Kubrick's apparent disinterest. All throughout you'll be wondering if Kubrick really had much input on this movie at all as it contains almost none of the touches he brought to his films before or after this one. Add to that the fact that this 'true story' really oversimplifies, skimps, and downright lies in its complete dearth of historical accuracy, this film may actually make you dumber having watched it. SPARTACUS is just a big disappointment all-round, despite some great performances and costuming.",4,17,33,2 August 2009
Alexander," What went wrong?
","I was as pumped to see this movie as anyone when this came out, in spite of the negative reviews. I was thinking it would be a movie like WINDTALKERS, which got totally slammed, but was a fun retread nonetheless if not taken seriously. When I finally got to see it, I found out, yeah... it is a huge mess, and uninteresting as the main actors - Farrell and Jolie, are absolutely dull and out of place. They're akin to casting DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz in GANGS OF NEW YORK. These young hipster actors just don't work in historical epics. Maybe Billy Zane or Christian Bale would work... but no more Orlando Blooms. Who can take these seriously? In 50 years when people look back on this, how is a young Colin Farrell going to stack up against a young Marlon Brando or Richard Burton? Will anyone even remember Farrell? There are diamonds in the rough to be had though... Vangelis's music is among his best in recent years, grand and orchestral tough retaining a little of his trademark soaring synthesizers. It works very well in a period piece. Brian Blessed and Christopher Plummer have welcome (if too brief) cameos... and the scene where Alexander attacks the elephant with his horse (though overblown) works fairly well.The rest of the movie is (to put it in English) utter pap. Stone did such great work with JFK, PLATOON, and arguably NATURAL BORN KILLERS... what happens when you stick him with a lot of great genre actors and Vangelis? How did this go wrong? Oh yeah, Farrell and Jolie... not to mention a mishandled story from page 1. At least they never made the Alexander movie Baz Luhrman was planning for so long to star Leonardo DiCaprio... THAT would have likely been even worse.",4,5,7,11 May 2006
A Bridge Too Far," A star-studded 70's disaster movie set against the backdrop of an Allied defeat in World War II
","A Bridge Too Far falls under its own weight in many ways with a lot of distracting cameos and an overly bombastic score. Also, it stumbles right out of the gate with a completely historically inaccurate and oversimplified narration that certainly angered any veterans of the Eastern, Italian, or African Fronts by erroneously claiming that up until D-Day the Germans were winning the war. Much of the rest of the writing falters under banalities and clichés, with some real life historical figures such as British General Browning and German Field Marshall Model portrayed as utterly incompetent (winning The Battle of Arhhem only because of luck and British hubris rather than due to his own ability). As usual for most old-fashioned war movies, the Germans are portrayed as largely heartless and often doltish with the Americans heroic, the British pompous, and the Poles and Dutch as noble victims of their circumstances.However, the film has a lot going for it that World War II films up to that point hadn't done. The battle scenes manage to attain a level of chaos, brutality, and realism unmatched for another 20 years. In addition to showcasing a lot of fairly accurate equipment, the action is edited well with great sound design (aside from those squeaky 'beep' ricochets) and pyrotechnics. The scene where XXX Corp. first encounters the German lines with its devastating artillery barrage and then stumbling into an ambush ranks among my favorite war scenes, accurately portraying the sheer wide-scale savagery and how quickly great plans can fall apart.As usual for 'big' movies of the time, there really isn't a plot or character arcs because of just how many overlapping stories and vignettes there are. A few bigger stars like James Caan, Robert Redford, and Elliot Gould get only 2 scenes - one small one to introduce their character and one larger one in which they do something memorable to service the action, usually calling back to something their character said in their introduction as though each one had some vaguely ironic prescient ability. Some of the stunt-casting actually makes the film worse, such as Gene Hackman doing his best but completely failing to fool anyone into believing he's Polish.History buffs, such as myself, will get a big kick though out of the straightforwardness of the presentation of Operation Market Garden. It's interesting even to see the generals posit over maps and see their plans come to fruition inter-cut with the small stories of the regular people on the ground. The operation certainly deserved a big picture to tell its story and with impressively mounted spectacle in the age before CGI and visual effects. The larger screen you watch it on and the more interested in WW2 history you are, the more impressed you'll be.",7,0,1,27 July 2016
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Disney and J.J. go into full-on Schlock Mode!
","The two words that came to me watching this enjoyable mess were 'desperate' and 'cowardly'.Desperate because the film tried so hard to please everyone by working in so many characters and references that it completely lost focus. With BB-8, R2D2, and C3PO, we just have too many damn robots. So what do they do? They add in yet another one! We lost our big and bad female stormtrooper Phasma but replaced her with two new pointless female characters (a bounty huntress and a former storm trooper) who both only seem to exist to give Poe and Finn someone to have chemistry with aside from each other. Rey is still doing her own thing, so overpowered and invulnerable that the film creaks along with a total absence of tension......which leads me to the Cowardly aspect. The film pulls absolutely every punch from the start. Remember when Finn almost killed himself in The Last Jedi, only to get rescued from it at the very last second? Well here we get at least 3 instances where a character makes a brave sacrifice only for their 'death' to be undone in the very next scene! It's as though Disney just can't kill off any of the main characters no matter what happens. The emperor shows up again, because 'duh, what else were they gonna do?' However the moral conundrum he puts before Rey gets solved in the blandest way possible, which would never have even been a problem for him had he not just announced his plan to her seconds earlier just like a Bond Villain.I really cracked up at his new ability to summon star destroyers at will, complete with loyal crews on several vessels. There's a ton of throwaway, possibly ADR'ed afterthought-lines thrown in here and there by offscreen characters such as 'it's time to recruit more children on planets to serve in my fleet' but later a character says 'they're going to deploy their fleet in 17 hours!'. Well hell, those child-slave star destroyer crewmen grow up quick! I guess a lot can be accomplished when you go at light speed while Relativity makes time freeze for everyone else (when it serves the plot). However the rules of light speed, warp speed, hyperspace, etc. come to make absolutely no sense in context to the plot and what happens during the last act of the movie. Apparently it's just as easy for the heroes to summon a good guy fleet into existence in mere hours when all they need is 'hope'! Luckily, for all the star destroyers the First Order had when the movie started, they couldn't spare any to defend their new fleet at its most vulnerable moment? Or spare a few extra control towers in case one gets destroyed?These plot holes and contrivances come on fast and furious like every other plot element in the film. It would get annoying if it wasn't so quick that one literally has no time to think about it... just like an Umberto Lenzi crimer like THE TOUGH ONES or one of Kinji Fukasaku's Yakuza movies. It's not helped here that there's already too many characters but the film finds time to dump in plenty of new ones (in addition to the ones already mentioned) as well as so many ghost cameos of the old gang that it actually becomes funny after a while.What a mess. It's disappointing that we never got to see the gang all back together as we had hoped before this new series came to theaters. Instead, we get all these bland new characters who never go on any arc and don't have any flaws or motivations at all. Adam Driver stands as the bright spot here but even his character suffers from Rian Johnson and J.J. Abrams pulling a tug-o-war on him over three movies. In the end, this franchise will make its money, but at the cost of having me, or any of the other fans of the original films, ever take the Star Wars brand seriously again. Worth watching for mindless fun, some laughs, and ultimately to join in on the conversation of why these movies didn't work.",5,1,1,26 December 2019
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Excellent effects and performances but the script has some issues that haven't aged well
","When this movie came out, it was a watershed moment, especially among us 11-year-olds who were just now able to see R-rated movies here and there. At the time, we weren't thinking critically about whether things made much sense and we weren't comparing it to the first movie (which most of us saw later). The film changed the game of what a big-budget R-rated action movie could be, with top notch effects and plenty of scenes that will stay with you many years later.As a jaded middle-aged adult who has studied and attempted my share script writing and film making, I can certainly appreciate the original film as a mini-masterpiece of mood, atmosphere, and a lean, mean film all around. It's got a few underwhelming effects shots but overall a miraculous production considering its relatively low budget.Here with the sequel, they upped the budget 15 times, Arnold was already a major movie star, they threw in a spunky kid to be his sidekick, and so they had to up the threat level in terms of a new invulnerable foe. With the T-1000, I would say they were 100% successful in creating an interesting and relentless threat via the groundbreaking effects and Robert Patrick's genius performance. However, in the script, the machine would have been a lot scarier more tense had it behaved a little smarter.For instance - I don't understand why it has to keep reverting to the same form as Robert Patrick even later in the film when everyone knows who he is. One of its main assets is that it can copy other people and infiltrate. Think how easy it would have been to get closer to John in the factory if it just took the form of Arnold or anyone else who would seem more trustworthy. Another issue is that it doesn't just obliterate Arnold when it gets the chance on at least two occasions. I think since it's a more advanced model, it'd be aware of Arnold's power core and CPU location and could easily have just punctured those things and walked away. Why didn't it do this? Well, because we wouldn't have had a movie otherwise.After the amazing T-1000 morphing effects and a few heartless, dehumanizing kills, I still have to say that I'm a bit let down that this film just doesn't have the dark edginess and grit that the original had. It's not a small movie about a pursuit but a more muddled epic affair where the main characters go off on a bit of a tangent to change history later in the film which robs it of a lot of its energy. While it boasts bigger chase scenes with impressive choreography, the film had a lot less fatalities in an effort to give it more mass audience appeal.It's unfortunate the terminator doesn't get to terminate anyone, even prior to receiving his new orders, especially as it later comes to the detriment of the main characters as the officers he merely wounds are still capable of disrupting their plans. The film itself lacks daring to give the characters a hard choice; what if killing a few people could prevent the end of the world? Could you still do it? It would have been so much more interesting to see characters just go with a bold choice instead of playing it both ways in such a wishy-washy manner.Cameron just kept making bigger and bigger films as the years went on, with TITANIC and AVATAR both decent films but way more lavish and expensive than the scripts really dictated. Also an unfortunately byproduct of the success of this film would be the solidification of a repetitive formula that would haunt the franchise this spawned. The concept of a future war between humans and machines has so much that could be done with it. Why is every film in this series just another time travel plot about protecting some future savior of mankind and a bunch of chase scenes? Oh yeah, because this film made so much money, and the studios just think that all we will ever want is more of the same.",7,0,1,31 October 2019
Cross of Iron," Accurately messy experience with the Eastern Front
","While there have been a few movies at this point to deal with the Eastern Front (most recently the German TV series 'Our Mothers Our Fathers'), nothing including STALINGRAD and the numerous Finnish war films have captured the horrific nature of the grit and fighting quite like this one. Sam Peckinpah uses editing like a science and makes this film a sort of WILD BUNCH in Eastern Europe. The quick cutting, slow motion, and balletic cross-cutting back and forth creates an exciting fever dream of an experience and certainly breathes a lot of life into the film's more superfluous scenes (such as Steiner's trip to the home front). We don't get exploding heads, murdered civilians, and entrails all over the place so I can't call this an anti-war movie along the lines of COME AND SEE. I would instead call this possibly the most macho WW2 adventure ever made with a strong satirical tone not really made too obvious until the last reel (which is a bit of a fluke I hear as reportedly they had run out of money to make it the way Peckinpah had originally envisioned).This may be the only film to depict the desperate German holdout in the Taman Peninsula in the summer of 1943. My main complaint is that it isn't given much context (ie. a glorious map session like we got in BATTLE OF NERETVA or A BRIDGE TOO FAR) because the Taman Kessel was a unique phenomena of the war with its only resupply / escape over the Kerch straits to Crimea. On one hand it was the only hope the Germans had of ever attacking the oil fields of the Caucasus again, and on the other hand a very precarious and easily isolated pocket.Nope, in this movie we are down in the trenches with the men for the most part, fighting for their lives every day and not very conscious or concerned with the greater strategy of the war. They may as well have set this in the Rzhev meatgrinder, which was probably even more horrific but beyond this film's budgetary scope. Most of the Germans (outside of oddly cast James Coburn and two of his senior officers) are played by real German actors speaking accented English. Once you get past the casting of American Coburn and Englishmen Mason and Warner in the key roles, it actually feels much more authentic than, say, ENEMY AT THE GATES. It falls victim to a couple cliches of course, with Zoll the ardent Nazi of Steiner's group being suicidally incompetent and a rapist (who is even introduced as a possible SS man though that wouldn't make any sense for him to be serving in a Wehrmacht unit so early in the war) who of course gets his just desserts. Maximilian Schell's villain is more of a Prussian aristocrat obsessed more with glory than Nazi racist/homophobic policies, even exploiting them to his advantage, which is a nice change of pace.See with an open mind especially as a fan of Peckinpah's other action films. Pound for pound, it probably boasts the most action of all his films. Don't expect to be too enlightened or educated about the horrors of war or the human condition, though there are a couple good such scenes sprinkled here and there.",8,1,3,27 December 2018
28 Days Later...," how to fight zombies after the Brady Bill
","(while I admire the effort and usually love this sort of movie, I have to rate this one as a total failure)Until the arrival of some military squaddies at the end, there's little to no mention of firearms in this film.  If zombies had taken over, I think finding a gun would be on the top of my to-do list.  At the very least, if I'd woken up one morning to find a city abandoned, I'd still get a gun at the very least for hunting purposes (horse meat, anyone?).
The most troubling aspect of this movie is its total lack of originality. The basic premise is stolen from THE CRAZIES and DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS, with a virus wiping everything out and making people go mad.  Then it shoots into DAWN OF THE DEAD territory with characters raiding a store in a very inferior fashion (again neglecting real weapons), and then DAY OF THE DEAD when we run into some hapless underdeveloped military goons not unlike the convicts in ALIEN 3.  There's also a 12 MONKEYS/STREETFIGHTER/CLOCKWORK ORANGE reference at the beginning, involving apes being conditioned by watching violent images, then getting let loose by animal rights activists.The plot and premise is full of holes: why do rage victims not attack each other?  How do they violate the laws of physics to get so much blood and energy?  How would a virus that takes effect so quickly spread across a body of water?  (I could just imagine an airline pilot still piloting his route, totally oblivious to the fact that all his passengers are hyperactive blood-barfing zombies - or someone calmly boarding a plane right in the 15-20 seconds after getting bitten.)Most memorably bad is the awful look to the cinematography.  I've shot with a Canon XL-1 with little to no understanding of how to properly white-balance it or do good lighting, and the picture I got didn't look nearly this bad, with pixelly video artifacts, jagged lines, etc.  The cheapness really showed through during the brighter scenes.  With a $15 million dollar budget, the filmmakers may as well have used 16mm or 35mm, because even though they blocked traffic and shot DV on the fly, there's still a few shots where you can clearly see cars in the distance.All in all, this movie sounds a lot better than it is.  None of the violence is clearly visible due to a rapid ADD-like style of cutting during the action scenes.",Null,0,0,30 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," an overblown waste of money
","Peter Jackson's films worked best when they didn't take themselves seriously at all (as in the case of BRAINDEAD or MEET THE FEEBLES).  His trilogy so far is indeed very well shot and edited (though each film so far could easily afford to cut at least an hour away), but the big mistake here is that the films keep wavering back and forth from silly stuff to graveyard stoicism.The battle scenes are overinflated CGI extravaganzas with lots to look at but nothing really interesting.  I kept thinking of the film WATERLOO (the 1970 Sergei Bondarchuk version) and realized that the battle scenes in that 33-year-old film were actually better-filmed, more believable, and more enjoyable than here, where everything is fake - and definitely looks it. The music is unmemorable, as are the bland actors (except for the underused Brad Dourif and Christopher Lee of course, but these days the real talent is slowly getting replaced by the likes of 'Viggo Mortensen' and 'Liv Tyler') - but I digress.I'm not gonna stand on a soap box all night and rant about how silly this movie is and how the Tolkien and AD&D fans (and I used to be one myself) will eat up every minute of this.  However, I have to point out that it runs far too long, and the action sequences seem to just come and go without adding to the story in the least, just filler.  Basically, all the characters are in the same situation at the end that they were at the beginning of the film... the whole movie is filler.I actually preferred the animated 1978 Bakshi version, in that it was much better paced and felt more stylized and less like a big cash cow.  It's too bad that Bakshi never was able to finish his film, but then again he had about the same budget to make his film that the LOTR trilogy spent on wigs. That film actually had heart.In spite of the fact it was merely made to cash in on all the nerd-money not yet spent on computer games and 'Warhammer 40k' pewter models, this film will probably sweep the Oscars... which in my opinion is truly sad, considering there were probably thousands of better movies made this year - but so few were widely seen.",5,0,3,24 January 2003
Patton," Good character study, though a somewhat childish view of World War II
","Coming from the height of the Vietnam War, this very optimistic- spirited light-feeling war movie comes to feel somewhat out of place. At the time it came out, it might have been seen as a welcome retread to the gung-ho jingoistic war movies of the 50's and 60's with squeaky-clean heroism from the G.I.'s and sneering incompetence from the Germans. Also, the depictions of the battles in this movie, while often spectacular, feel pretty inaccurate and simplified for anyone who bothered to read a little more than the 9th-grade general-ed history books. It's almost as though the film just isn't interested so much in the war. The war is just a backdrop for the showcase of this complicated man.It's of another time, an era from before when history got complicated and we started really re-evaluating things... who the heroes of the war were and what really makes a man a 'hero'. How interesting is it to show people who never waver in confidence in the face of battle and never seem to fail? How responsible was Patton for the collapse of the 3rd Reich compared to the vast scale of the warfare waged by the Russians on the Eastern Front, not to mention the many who served above and below him? Was he just a cog in the machine or a truly extraordinary individual? This movie tells us the latter, but doesn't really tell us why or how beyond just all the other officers around him behaving like comparative imbeciles.That said, the film is wonderfully acted. George C. Scott was the perfect choice for the role and as long as the film focuses on him and his complicated relationship with the media, his fellow generals and allies, it works well. It just feels awfully dumbed-down to me in its depiction of the actual battles. PATTON may be a step up from THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE in terms of how well it technically pulls everything off, but just about on-par with it in terms of giving history credit where credit is due.",7,3,6,6 October 2017
2001: A Space Odyssey," 2001: A Solar Bore
","Possibly the most overrated science fiction film ever made, 2001: A Space Odyssey is more eye-candy than substance. Supposedly the film tells how extraterrestrial powers are behind the evolution of intelligence in humans or something to that effect, but in my opinion the film brings this message out in a very heavy-handed and overblown way. The first 20 minutes or so of the film aren't much more complex than your usual National Geographic primate documentary, instead with actors in ape suits in the place of real apes. Of course for no discernible reason, a monolith appears in the middle of an ape-tribe's camp overnight and merely the act of briefly pawing it makes them smart enough to use bones as weapons. Kubrick was obviously trying to make the monolith and its powers seem mystical and beyond the realm of human comprehension, but in this case he leaves too much to the imagination, as in failing to explain how the monolith got there, how it distributes intelligence, and why it would do such a thing. It's never explained, as very little is explained over the course of the film. Most of the film seems similarly vague and ambiguous, resulting in a downward spiral of confusion and boredom.Shortly afterward, the audience is bombarded with shot after dreary shot of space ships floating around in outer space. This entire 5-10 minute sequence serves absolutely no purpose other than to woo and wow the crowd with special effects. In this case, this 'classic' science fiction masterpiece is no better than your average Hollywood special effects spectacular nowadays. With modern audiences no longer wowed by such effects, the sequence seems hollow and boring, made even worse because the pay-off is two extended scenes of William Sylvester attending meetings on a space station and a moon base. These may well be two of the most boring and pointless scenes ever to make it into a theatrical film. Possibly Kubrick meant to contrast modern, boring man with the prehistoric (and also boring) primate man. None of it really comes together though as there is no sense of collision between these two sections of the film, and hence no cohesion to hold it together other than the appearance of the monolith, which for no discernible reason emits a high-pitched scream at Sylvester and his team of astronauts.The highly touted sequence involving HAL, the ultra-intelligent super-computer who terrorizes a deep-space exploration mission to Jupiter, seems kind of a side note to the greater story, and doesn't really fit in at all with the whole monolith/human intelligence theme. The Jupiter Mission would have made for a good movie in itself, and is by and large the most interesting section of the entire film, but once again, what does it have to do with anything? As can be expected, the ending is also highly pretentious and tries to put several meanings past the audience at once, not only making no sense whatsoever, but also remaining completely boring. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a film that definitely hasn't stood the test of time, and will do little more than bore its audience during the year it was meant to depict.",3,14,28,9 February 2001
Elysium," About as poorly thought-out as its obvious political message
","The biggest shock here for me was to see a film so completely righteously heavy-handed also stay incredibly and disappointingly simplistic. Blomkamp, much like in DISTRICT 9, does an excellent job setting up a world at the start where we're fascinated to see in which direction the story will go to expose the inner corruption of the system. Unfortunately we don't really get much more than a dumb action movie with a bunch of fight scenes coupled with some extremely blatant leftist propaganda.So the Halo-like space station orbiting earth now houses all the best and the brightest while the unwashed and diseased masses team in mountains of garbage looking for their excuse to get up onto the space station as well. The film makes it a point to focus more on the medical side of things to show that the 'illegals' just want access to the same health care as the rich, particularly for their terminally ill children. This just went a little too far in my opinion in trying to paint the earth people as saintly caretakers looking after their children. They are apparently not economic climbers eager to better their own quality of life by leaving the earth as opposed to cleaning things up and working toward a more just society where they are with what they have. Also, the rich people obviously must be evil for withholding low-cost in-home instantaneous miracle cures from the poor with no mention in the film as to what the real ramifications of such socialized medicine would be long-term.Jodie Foster, usually a capable performer, turns in a shockingly awful performance about as credible as the sneering villain from TIME CHASERS, complete with a similarly artificial accent. Matt Damon does an okay job as the protagonist much better suited to the dramatic acting than he is to the punch-out action scenes later in the film. I'm still not entirely sure why he, a white person, would be raised in a hispanic slum in the first place, other than to hypocritically white-wash an otherwise heavily leftist film which depicts every other white person as a sociopath and/or rapist. The only person who seems to be enjoying himself here is Sharlto Copley as the shirtless and tatted-up evil gang leader, which I've come to see is a trope that Blomkamp loves to repeat, along with the robot designs which pop up again in CHAPPIE, a similarly underwhelming and frustrating film. The last 20 minutes of the film are easily the worst, as we watch characters go through the motions toward a sadly inevitable conclusion that doesn't explore any of the rich universe it worked so hard to build in the first 20 minutes.In the better, nonexistent sequel, we'd see that Elysium gets overrun by economic migrants with vast tent cities eating up all the resources, and the rich ruling class has to either build another, better protected space station, or just allows itself to be enveloped by the class it spent so much money escaping. A much more interesting film would have spent more effort developing both sides of the argument, but that wouldn't be seen as too politically correct. I would love to think Blomkamp was actually in on the joke the whole time and somehow thought he was subverting how short-sighted the politics of the film really are, but there's very little actual evidence to support that any real thought went into the script.Good effects though.",3,1,4,22 October 2019
Once Upon a Time in America," Beautiful, exhausting, emotional, existential and frustrating gangster epic
","My opinion of this film has changed a lot over the past 25 years. When I first saw it as a teenager, I was interested but confused and bored for most of the running time for being too talky. Later in my snobby cinephile phase of 20's, I found it to be one of the most extraordinary and mystical films I'd seen outside of early Herzog and Vittorio De Sica. The bad 'old age' makeup always bothered me though and took me right out of the movie. Nowadays I find it a greatly flawed film which aimed too high for what its script ultimately achieved.Almost everything technically comes off amazingly polished considering that this was basically a bigger-budgeted Italian crime movie as they'd gotten so good at during the 1970's. Sergio Leone handles every frame with an OCD level of craftsmanship and the production design and cinematography are as good as you'll ever find. Robert De Niro, James Woods, and many of the supporters bring their A-game. Personally I would have loved to have seen more of Joe Pesci, Burt Young, Treat Williams, Frank Gio, Danny Aiello, Richard Bright, etc. but their roles all come and go extremely quickly and often with no resolution. It's a shame, but this film is not really interested in portraying a conventional kind of narrative. Instead it plays more like a very languid, slow-paced dream for better or worse, including its share of impressive pathos and frustrating red herrings.While portions of the film have a humorous tone such as the baby-swap scam and some of the shenanigans of the flashback child actors, it's overall an extremely sad experience most explicitly conveyed by the graphic rape scene and extremely cynical presentations of relationships and sexuality. The women gravitate toward the men who treat them the worst and lifelong friendships dissolve at the drop of a hat once political expediency demands otherwise. What little violence there is feels extremely gritty and punches hard, but almost all of it comes early in the film and practically nothing of note happens the final half hour.Overall I just feel like too much is missing from this film to be a fulfilling experience and possibly if was all left on the cutting room floor. Who was Frank Gio's character working for? What happened with the union? Why all the emphasis on the main gang being Jewish when it doesn't seem to affect anything later in the film? Why the trash compactor truck? I would recommend this to film buffs as it's much more well-polished than something like GANGS OF NEW YORK. However it's not nearly as exciting or as enlightening of a view of the criminal underworld as any of Scorsese's, Coppola's, or Brian De Palma's forays into similar territory. It avoids a lot of the organized crime movie cliches but to a such point where I wonder if the narrative would have worked even better outside of the genre.As fan of eurocult and B-movies, I have to say it's still a delight catching glimpses of the likes of Salvatore Billa, Bruno Bilotta, Olga Karlotos, Mario Brega, etc. sharing the screen with American crime cinema actors in a major film. A lot of the New York exterior sets found their way into several Italian post apocalyptic films in the early 80's including RUSH, A MAN CALLED RAGE, ESCAPE FROM THE BRONX, and 2019: AFTER THE FALL OF NEW YORK.",7,1,6,30 July 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," Groundhog D-Day
","For a film so on-the-nose featuring a modern day Normandy Invasion against MATRIX-like robot squid aliens who have taken over central Europe, this film works surprisingly well due to its fun hard scifi premise of reliving a time period over and over again until getting things 'right'. It's basically a send-up of the strange reality of video games, where the key to winning is not so much based on skill, but on memorization after hours and hours of trial and error. Ever seen an amazing speed-run of Super Mario or Battletoads online and wondered what it took to get there? This movie answers your questions, depicting it with a semi-plausible real-world scenario.The editor for the film certainly gave life to a concept that could easily become tiring. In fact, I would say this has to be one of the better-edited films I've seen in years. Things move along briskly and snappily and it was difficult to look away up until the climax of the film which unfortunately gets a little formulaic and stretchy to make things ultimately satisfying.Emily Blunt feels miscast as some battle-hardened veteran with perfect makeup, hair, and nary a scar from all her hand-to-hand combat. Sure the film would have been more realistic to have someone like Sam Elliot in her part as a shepherding mentor character, but wouldn't have the eye candy, and let's not kid ourselves there.Cruise does a good job playing a fish-out-of-water everyman type hero, but he's starting to get a little old to play this sort of character believably in such an action-heavy film. Action-wise, there are plenty of amazing stunts largely buried under a heavy torrent of VFX and CGI but thankfully not as obnoxiously as we've come to expect in films such as this.",7,1,1,15 October 2019
Downfall," History performed with lightning... makes me wish there was more of its kind
","The last 10 days of the 3rd Reich has been fodder for plenty of films over the years, easy to make a 3-act structure around and showcase the fascinating final days of a corrupt dictator losing touch with reality. It's easy too fall into the realm of cliche with every character in one form or another having to cope with the fact that within a few days, nothing in their lives will ever be the same again... their system of government, their jobs, their family life, their society. Everything is soon to end.Compared with THE BUNKER (1981) and HITLER: THE LAST 10 DAYS (1973), this film feels much more 'real'. Similarly with the others, it makes Albert Speer the natural voice of reason but strangely enough also puts Hermann Fegelein in this role once Speer leaves. Traudl Junge, though very much of Hitler's entourage, serves as the center of the film's point of view, giving the audience someone to side with due to her pure naivety.Good narrative technique here showcases some truly spectacular performances, principally Bruno Ganz as Hitler. He doesn't quite capture Hitler's look as well as Alec Guinness and his voice sounds too raspy and high-pitched, but his mannerisms and commitment to the part are truly a part to behold. He plays his role not of a screaming tyrant (like Anthony Hopkins) but of a human being exhibiting both the ego-driven confidence of a superstar yet the panicked tantrums of a 4-year-old when he does't get his way. Of all the historical films I've seen, this is the most difficult in which to forget that I'm just watching a movie and haven't been somehow transported magically back to the past no matter how many times I've seen it.The main rewatchability for me now comes from anaylzing the supporting players, all of Hitler's generals and 'friends' who stuck by his side to the end. Some, such as Jodl, Mohkne, and Speer were more clear-thinking, while others such as Goebbels had likely lost touch with reality even more-so. It's fascinating to see how people cope with their world crumbling in around them, helpless to do much about it, yet at the same time obeying the rules of their corrupt system and worshiping tyrants who made their own megalomania and insanity that much clearer by the day. In a rarity for films of this kind, a few characters belonging to the SS (namely Mohnke and Schenk) are even given a sympathetic portrayal trying to save lives and end unnecessary bloodshed, giving this film authenticity in terms of presenting the events in moral shades of grey as opposed to black and white.That said, DOWNFALL shuffles a lot of historical events around for sake of its narrative which bothered me. Goering, for instance, sent his telegram prior to Hitler's birthday and the shelling of Berlin by the Soviets. Fegelein was arrested prior to Himmler's 'betrayal' too and events only played out vaguely in the chronology that the film presents. I suppose that is one of the greatest difficulties of making a historical film; accurately conveying causality and fairness to historical characters while at the same time keeping things interesting to the audience.",8,1,1,16 December 2018
Jaws," I never really saw what all the fuss was about...
","Sure Jaws started a massive monster movie craze which has lasted all the way up to the present day, an was undisputedly a huge box office success worldwide, but that isn't saying it's necessarily a great or necessarily good movie.  I always found this film good in places but overall the viewing experience is an overlong and generally unpleasant one.This film has all the essentials of a good shark movie, the 3 R's... yeah Roy, Richard, and Robert.  Yes, the acting in this film is surprisingly top-notch for the genre, even Shaw who almost overdoes his thick seaman drawl to the point where it often becomes hard to understand.  There's also a classic musical score by John Williams, who with the Star Wars and Indiana Jones tracks has become one of the most successful composers in history, film or otherwise.  Probably the best aspect though is the photography which looks even more mystifying at night-time with an almost silvery-great look to the water than it does during the day.There, so it's a good movie but the hype surrounding it is totally overblown.  First of all, there's not really much in the way of action in this film.  There only are 4 actual shark attacks over the course of the film's 120+ minute running time.  The film slows down terribly near the end with the three men endlessly bantering amongst themselves ending with several repetitive scenes of them shooting harpoon after harpoon into the shark.  Maybe it's just the overfamiliarity of the subject matter that has come over the years, but the scene has very little in the way of tension. The mechanical sharks look awfully cheesy during some of the close-up shots revealing some wrinkles in the rubber nose.  On top of that, the ending was completely ridiculous, in that there was no way the guy could have gotten out of the cage and hid from the shark for several minutes.
So to conclude, this film is a good movie, but it never was really worthy of the classic status its overblown hype has brought it.",4,8,32,3 December 2000
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Godfather Four: Revenge of the Golden Voyage of Sinbad
","Paging a script doctor to the O.R., this series needs resuscitation, stat!Don't walk, RUN out of this meandering and tedious mishmash of clichés and ill-conceived ideas masquerading under the STAR WARS banner. I thought I'd learned my lesson after the abysmal EPISODE 1 and the mildly better ATTACK OF THE CLONES. Don't get me wrong, as movies all of these prequels are at about average sci-fi films, but when taken into context as a series with the original trilogy... well, the first two anyway... all three are exercises in sheer pointlessness.Everything risible about the first two prequels is just as on display here. However sidelined the hated Jar Jar Binks is, he's replaced by equally irritating new characters like the not-funny coughing robot who sprouts four light sabers in a scene aping THE GOLDEN VOYAGE OF SINBAD. While we're on idea-theft, let's not forget the montage when all the Jedis get killed simultaneously as though we're watching the next installment of THE GODFATHER series. The clichés don't stop there, complete with a scene with Darth Vader screaming 'NOOOO' to the sky while the camera pulls back, and copious amounts eyebrow raising bits of dialog. The worst part where Annakin is named Darth Vader, followed by John Williams's theme blaring in the background,as it has all the subtlety of a mallet cracking across the audience's heads.No originality or suspense at all is to be found in this film. Why? Because in addition to the problems inherent in making prequels in general, it's written like the sentence I began this paragraph with, in passive, banal writing that reads as though a 4th grader won a contest and got to mail in the script. Darth Vader's spiral into evil makes no sense and seems to just come out of nowhere... no surprise as the character arc takes huge jumps in order to hasten the sagging pace, and yet the film STILL comes off as stiff and boring whenever the lasers stop flying.How does this series still have fans? Films like this are an embarrassment to the industry, as well as people who liked the original films. At least Marin County digital garbage like this keeps the bar low for independent filmmakers. I assume it's now up to the video games and toys to attract new fans and make George Lucas his money now that the film series has completely imploded upon itself.",5,6,10,22 May 2005
The Deer Hunter," For a movie with so many themes, it doesn't feel like it's really 'about' anything.
","Working class steel mill workers, friendship, emotionally complex relationships, Vietnam, and Russian Roulette. This film tackles all these subjects with a pretty broad brush and makes no judgment. It's a groundbreaking film though certainly a letdown especially for those going in with the wrong expectations.I've seen this film twice; once at age 15-16 and again at at 35. The first time I saw it, I was immensely disappointed, expecting some kind of PLATOON-style action war movie. After so much time being spent on the wedding, there's really only one action scene presented and it frustratingly cuts away just when the Viet Cong close in. What a missed opportunity it was to show some more De Niro, Christopher Walken, and John Savage desperately gunning down hoards of enemies. No, you're going to have to watch THE DOGS OF WAR or MCBAIN to see anything like that. It's disappointing that is is about as close as De Niro ever got to being an action hero, but this is just not that kind of film. I had heard it's a Vietnam War movie, but it's not. It's really a movie about Russian immigrant steel workers living a bleak existence drinking their lives away in some Podunk Pennsylvania town. It seems that the only meaning they have in their lives is deer hunting and their camaraderie, but even after coming back to this film I didn't catch much character development, especially around De Niro and Walken's characters. The war gives them something to look forward to and ends up shattering their lives.Two decades later I see that this film (especially during the first hour) is more like one of those popular at the time 70's 'slice of life' movies like FIVE EASY PIECES or the more recent GARDEN STATE, where we just watch people do things and randomly interact in a very mundane way. The only semblance of a plot comes with the war, the Russian Roulette, and the search for Walken's character. However all that maybe takes up 45 minutes of plot in a 3 hour movie. Peter Zinner may have been a legendary editor (though hacking up the U.S. release of KING KONG VS. GODZILLA and making an abortive attempt as a director with the horrible THE SALAMANDER) but here just lets scenes float way longer than they need to. The film would have worked just as well if that endless wedding scene was only 5 minutes long.However, I must point out that the performances across the board are excellent and the emotional buildup to the climax is very tense, cathartic, and ultimately tragic. It's very hard not to get touched by the final death scene, which is among the best work of all involved. Unfortunately things unravel later on when it seems Cimino didn't know how to end the thing. Also you'll be hard pressed to find a film of that year with more captivating outdoor cinematography, which THE DEER HUNTER is worth a watch for even for just that reason.I've seen a few of Cimino's films, trying to understand why he was seen as such a Hollywood prodigy through his career and given so many chances even after the disastrous HEAVEN'S GATE. I consider his best film to be YEAR OF THE DRAGON, a New York police movie that isn't explicitly an action movie, but is edited much tighter and with better character development than this film.",7,0,1,8 February 2016
Beowulf," Like watching dead people act.
","I went into this movie totally cold, and there were no beginning credits... it wasn't until the end when 'directed by Robert Zemeckis' popped up when everything clicked. It's like the awful POLAR EXPRESS all over again, with more of the same creepily realistic 3D Animated characters trying to sub in for real actors. With this movie, they get dangerously close to convincing (in some shots), but there's still something not right. The characters are beautifully animated and detailed, but lacking the life that real human actors would have... instead looking like a bunch of reanimated corpses interacting with each other. The effect is interesting in that it's a momentarily unique visual style (as SIN CITY and 300 were) but unsettling and overall quite useless and underwhelming when the big action sequences look just as cartoonish and fake as anything from CGI fest films made over a decade ago.The plot is pretty awful too, with a decent though padded and drawn out first half that follows the book fairly well. About midway through, the film drastically changes direction and adds a whole 'nother act which is boringly paced and has a few plot 'twists' that anyone should see long before they are revealed. Actually, the whole second half of the movie is a virtual remake of Scorsese's LAST TEMPTATION OF Christ with Beowulf instead coming to a crossroad decision involving a lusty maiden....which brings me to Angelina Jolie. What is so damn irresistible about her? She returns as basically the same gratingly abrasive character she played in Alexander, same awful vampire accent and everything. Hey scenes are awfully steamy and erotic for a PG-13 rated film, not that I have anything against it, but I wouldn't be too thrilled about my kids seeing it. The gore is also quite needlessly grotesque. As much as I like seeing people getting rended and disemboweled, this film crosses the line especially with Grendel's appearance and actions. A whiny rotting zombie/ogre exposed eardrum that throbs is not something I'm particularly excited about seeing.Also, why would a dragon have such a puny heart? And what was that life-size Academy Award doing lying on the beach?",4,7,16,26 November 2007
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A New American Tradition; Another 'Meh' Fantasy Blockbuster for Christmas?
","While this film didn't quite cause me to shoot baffled glances, eyerolls, and chuckles with my neighboring theater-goers like the prequels did, it certainly left me feeling underwhelmed and a little embarrassed to have spent money on something so cynically aimed at getting me to do just that. There's just very little new and interesting here, outside of a compelling opening scene which features A) Max Von Sydow, and B) some welcome development on what it means to be a storm trooper. After that first 10 minutes though FORCE AWAKENS sadly goes strictly by-the-numbers, and hits many of the exact same notes that STAR WARS (and yes, I'm aging myself to refer to it not by its episode number) did including Death Star destroying a planet, cantina scene, droid with important data stashed on desert planet, game of holographic claymation chess, heroes sneaking around Death Star lowering shields, etc etc. There were a couple new things, like the first killer CGI tentacle aliens yet in a Star Wars movie, but they come and go so quick that you'll forget about them immediately.The goofiest thing about this movie to me that kept striking me while watching, is how ridiculously small of a universe it establishes. Now, I'm no astronomer or physicist or anything, but in order for a planet to have gravity and an ecosystem, it has to be pretty big, right? Like, thousands of miles across? So, why is it that every time two important characters on the same quest happen to be on a planet they are within walking distance of each other? Okay, and if randomly crashing and marooned on said planet with the Empire hot on your tail, how would one have time to wander to a settlement unless one happened to be oh forget it! So, this Death Star is about as big as the planet Earth, but coincidentally has the prisoner interrogation room just an easy walk away from the important shield controls? Also, space itself is a pretty big place, right? So why is it so hard to hide from the Empire, say to go hide behind some random asteroid like they did in EMPIRE STRIKES BACK? How does news travel so quick, like that the Empire (or First Order, whatever) is looking for that Soccer-ball Droid travel instantly to this outlaw planet and to some random space smugglers? Is everyone tuned in on some kind of faster-than-light space TV/radio/internet service we never see? Why is everyone so quick to sell the heroes out? Does everyone just love and respect this First Order? Why? What have they done to earn such unwaivering loyalty the universe-over? Where'd they get the money from to buy off all these thugs unless the Space Smugglers and Cantina Woman were all just major coincidences? I think the real movie we needed to see was the one that answered these questions, not the one we got.However the most immediate problem I noticed while watching was the lack of clear motivations by the main characters. They all felt like totally blank slates to me and kept splitting up and wandering around the cantina planet for reasons that aren't even properly explained. Why not stick with Han and just go straight to Princess Leia and the resistance once learning about them? Did Finn really have more important things to do after making the snap decision to kill off dozens of his own men? What also could have used explanation was who this Emperor Snoke character was (possibly Gargamel from 'The Smurfs' or one of the trolls from the Jackson Hobbit?), how he took control, what he is trying to accomplish, and how he can find all these willing and obedient servants from all over the galaxy to work for him, especially considering that the casualty rates suffered in all these frequent Death Star explosions.Okay, it certainly could have been worse. The special effects mostly looked pretty good, Williams's score soared, there was some effort to restore the lived-in grittiness of the original trilogy, and there was minimal CGI cartoon stupidity aside from Snoke and the Yoda-like lady who ran the cantina. I appreciate that there were more substantial female characters, though to me it all felt a little overboard as part of aiming the franchise in as politically correct a direction as possible. The only white men in the film were of course the two villains, unless you count Han Solo in perhaps Harrison Ford's most phoned-in performance in well, weeks. Sadly, he and Carrie Fisher have no chemistry at all anymore and we never get to see 'the gang all back together again' in any one scene like we were all hoping for. What we do get is a 'passing the torch to the new generation' type film focusing on millennial nobodies, much like such modern masterpieces as THE EXPENDABLES 3, INDIANA JONES 4, and Abrams's own STAR TREK reboot. If you loved those films, are physically or mentally under the age of 15, and find your soul aching and yearning to see a Star Wars-themed film on the big screen, this one is for you. Otherwise, it's much more palatably viewed as what it really is; a glossy and bloated fan-film rather than actually part of the Star Wars saga.Lastly, I can't be the only one who sees it as an utterly cynical cash-grab to have Mark Hamill given front billing on the film when he's only in it about 30 seconds before the end credits roll: 'Stay tuned for the next installment via a film which will actually star the person we claimed on the posters and trailers would be starring in THIS movie that'll just be another $15 please.'",5,45,54,26 December 2015
The Thin Red Line," the most horribly boring movie ever.
","This is one of those movies that just makes you sit back and think... about how much you'd rather be getting your teeth drilled than sitting through this.  Terence Malick is easily the most overblown filmmaker ever, confusing 'style' with endless shots of plants and animals in some vain effort to say some point about the horrors of war... blah.Unfortunately, I remember I paid the full amount to watch this in the theater and hence had to watch the whole thing through, hoping that at one point it would actually improve.  Much to my dismay, the film gets more and more pointless as it goes along, with soldiers sitting around and philosophizing more than actually fighting and defending the country.  I may be mistaken but the last time I checked, soldiers were enlisted during WW2 to fight a war, not to hang around a village wondering why humans feel the need to fight.  What's the point of all this?  It's not like America is going to completely change its view on the human anguish of war because of a bunch of random musings by dirty G.I.'s and once-great actors making vintage cameo appearances.If you want to see a decent war flick, stick with Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter, or Platoon.   Skip The Thin Red Line unless you really, really need something to help with insomnia... ZZzzzzzzz",4,1,5,12 December 2000
Windtalkers," a movie for guys who like movies!
","John Woo may possibly be the best director working in Hollywood today.  He has a perfect sense of balletic style to his action scenes unseen in this country since Sam Peckinpah.  He also seems to derive a lot of inspiration from Italian filmmakers.  He has the best slow motion since Enzo G. Castellari and the use of zoom lens since Umberto Lenzi.  Blend this technique into an ultra-violent war film and you get quite an entertaining package.People interested in well-told stories and believability should skip this one.  This movie is far from realistic with lead actor Cage easily mowing down scores of Japanese soldiers without even looking at them.  Every American soldier killed in the movie takes at least 2-3 bullet hits before biting the dust (eventually) while the Japanese soldiers instantly die once a shot is fired in their vague direction.  However, the film has lots of action, lots of killings, and actually a couple fairly suspenseful scenes to keep you more-than awake.  Those of you B-movie fans out there will be pleased to see the triumphant return of stock war footage in place of cheesy CGI for the battleship scenes... though there is light use of CGI later in the film for the airplanes.This is the true victory of style over content.  Although the film wanders from its original path and gets lost in the action, you'll be far too entertained to care.  Those of you viewers who are like me and like to turn your brain off and just watch hundreds of humans blow each other to bits, those of you who were angered by how WE WERE SOLDIERS kept cutting back to 'the home front', should waste no time in seeing this film.  It's a classic action-packed and violent war film which pulls no punches and has no romance... just the way we like it.  The story of Navajo code-talking is negligible and barely scratched, but the acting is decent, photography and set design excellent, and action/stuntwork absolutely spectacular.The film is mildly repetitive and overlong, but a lot of us out here like this kind of film that way.  Now if only they'd make a film presenting the war from the Japanese perspective... (besides TORA! TORA! TORA!, which was only 1/2 Japanese anyway)",9,8,18,16 June 2002
Mad Max: Fury Road," No MAD MAX 2, but about as good as could be expected with modern action sensibilities
","In my view, writing comments on current releases is fairly pointless as they'll disappear into all the noise, but the MAD MAX franchise is one I'm particularly passionate about, so allow me to attempt at some degree of objectivity while writing this glowing review. I'm a curmudgeon when it comes to action and sci fi movies. In my view, stunt work is much less impressive when half or more of it is accomplished via green-screen and rendered human beings. Science Fiction relies on visual stimulus and often massive destruction effects (miniatures, matte painting, and stop motion) to add to the constructed universe and entertainment factor, now diluted so much by the knowledge that rooms full of outsourced nerds in Canada, India, New Zealand and China are clicking pixels around until everything is absolutely 'perfect'. So in my view, making an action and stunt-heavy science fiction film in this day and age is an uphill battle to impress a weary action fan such as this, but this film did the best job it could.Was it perfect? No. There were issues with pacing, inconsistent character development, some awkward CGI (yes especially in terms of CGI humans for stunt work), and Hardy's performance and characterization not quite up to snuff. I was also put off by some distractingly gimmicky 3D shots like a steering wheel floating in the screen after an explosion.Perfectly imperfect? Almost. If this film had brought back a haggard 60+ Mel Gibson finding HIS redemption and otherwise been the same I would have given it a 9. I absolutely love how The Toecutter from the original MAD MAX returns here as Immortem Joe, showing that geriatric villains can be just as threatening as any other. With each successive MAX film there has been more and more of a feminist approach to the presentation of tough women dominating men. In this film, they go a bit over the top with it, but not to the point where it's utterly unbelievable a la HUNGER GAMES where a scrawny woman has no problem defeating a muscle-bound man in a fistfight without even taking breaking a sweat. Refreshingly, a lot of the female characters are put in just as much peril and take just as much unceremonious damage and fatalities as their male counterparts. All things being equal, it's great fun and something new, though at the end of the day I can't see a lot here in this blighted dystopian landscape that would attract a lot of female viewers.Reasonably entertaining? Of course. This film is loaded with a lot of carnage, stunt work, and visual stimulus including some delicious really wasteful and global-warming-contributing gasoline explosions of a like not seen since the 90's. The color palette is beautiful, the women gorgeous to look at, and some of the production design for the vehicles and sets some of the most creative of the steam-punk genre seen since BLADE RUNNER. A few moments really had me at the edge of my seat, such as the overlapping battling across multiple vehicles near the end. I only wish there was more of this.What would I have changed? Max didn't need all those ghost voices following him around through the film, and could have used some character development outside of that. He could have played a more central role in driving the plot forward. The ending needed more of an impact or crazy crescendo to build up to. I'd have added another element such as a time factor on closing the pass, another tribe emerging, or a bigger explosion or mega-car-pileup to close things with. It's difficult not to feel a bit disappointed that things end on a whimper. Movies don't know how to end these days. Also, much like GRAVITY, this film suffers from protagonists living through things that would have killed anyone in real life. There's no way any human being would have lived through a couple of these high speed crashes (especially with one's neck chained to one of such vehicles), so I'd have ironically toned some of the danger down a tad to increase this universe's realism/tension level.I get the feeling that an unrated release will be on its way. I'm picking this movie apart, but aside from what I mentioned, it gets so much right. It's got a crazy bald guy playing a flame-throwing guitar while wearing bright red 1800's pajamas for God's sake. It's one for the boys, but also one for anyone needing a modern big screen action fix.",8,2,9,18 May 2015
Gladiator," good viewing, but FAR from great.
","At least it was better than that 13th Warrior 'movie' that came out last year... it's actually quite entertaining at time, but Gladiator is much too sloppy it seat itself on the top 100 list!Beginning with a badly edited battle scene (what's with all the close-ups of swords clinging and such...  I can't tell what the hell's going on!) and a cameo by an very, very old-looking Richard Harris, Gladiator finally shifts into high-gear when the guy starts to do his Gladiator-thing.  The problem is that it takes too long to get there, and when the film's there they ruin it with ye standard old 'revenge' plot - basically the same thing that brought down THE CROW.Russel Crow is wooden, but there's some good supporting performances by Oliver Reed (his last performance), Derek Jakobi, and even a small role for seldom-seen actor David Hemmings (from HEROIN BUSTERS, DEEP RED, and SWINDLE) as a wig-wearing ring announcer.  Ridley Scott's 'dark' Alien/Blade Runner moody photography is out of place in the many interior and (in one case) exterior shots of Rome... which looks a bit too Computer Graphicky to buy.  The high points come with the gladiatorial combat, which looks good and has some decent ideas and bloodletting, but is confusingly shot and edited.  One thing I really didn't like was Joaquin Phoenix as the whiney bad guy... how would he have intimidated anybody? The ending is highly unplausable, not to mention historically inaccurate. It's enjoyable at times, but is an overall groan-inducing experience.  Not Scott's worst work, though not his best either.",4,0,1,9 June 2000
