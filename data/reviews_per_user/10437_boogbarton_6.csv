It," A lot of good jump scares! Good scary movie, but not too scary
","Finally got around to seeing IT. Well worth it, should've seen it sooner. Reminds me a lot of Stranger Things. Too scary for under 10 yr olds but okay for preteens & teens. The friendships, special bonds & struggles has the same familiar feel of other Stephen King stories, such as Stand By Me. Pennywise (Skarsgard) does an amazing job. His minicing smiles, contortion movements & Joker laugh gives Tim Curry a run for his money. Fun to watch and jump a few times. Can't wait for chapter 2.",8,1,2,12 August 2018
Wind River," Very good modern day western.
",It's slow moving but very entertaining to watch. Cinematography and setting is a character of its own. The acting is outstanding by everyone especially Jeremy Renner. Turn up the volume you don't want to miss the omniscient sound track.,10,1,2,9 August 2019
Captain Marvel," Enterta
","The overall pace and style was off from the beginning. Besides being Marvel charcrcters you wouldn't know it was a Marvel movie. We needed Taika Waititi, James Gunn, Russo's to do this film. This may be the problem. It had no style or visceral feel like the other Directors put in their films. It fell short on its action sequences, character connectivity and excitement. A lot of the scenes were visually dark and our hero was very flat throughout. Wanted to love this movie so much but gotta say a little disappointed.",Null,0,2,11 March 2019
Aquaman," Good movie! Very watchable... for anyone.
",A lot of action. Good story. Likable characters. Long movie but worth the 2hr + runtime.,10,0,2,30 March 2019
Bird Box," Disturbing movie, but worth a watch!!
","In the zombie and end of the world genre this does it. Yes, disturbing and uncomfortable at times. This movie really makes you think what would you do in this survival situation. There are some scenes that felt hard to get through but the horror/fantasy aspect wil make it more unreal. It's a watch...Sandra Bullock is great as usual. She will not disappoint.",8,2,5,28 December 2018
Joker," Excellent! Dark, gritty and pleasantly uncomfortable movie.
","You'll laugh uncomfortably, Just like Joker!
What a brilliant movie! Very well made dark Interpretation of mental illness. Cinematography, film score and direction are brilliant. Joaquin Phoenix Does an outstanding performance. Definitely Oscar worth.",10,4,8,7 October 2019
