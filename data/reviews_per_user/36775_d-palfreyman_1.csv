Deepwater Horizon," Underwhelming story with massive environmental effects.
","Titanic without the love story. Spent the first 30 minutes of this bored. I know they have to build up the characters but this just seemed to be filling film. Lots of little things which just seemed a bit clich√©. When it got going though, wow I've never seen so much fire in one movie! Lots of explosions and dangerous situations for the characters to be in. I just failed to buy the hackneyed story of BP oil execs pushing and the rig crew pushing back and then just caving to the pressure. Perhaps if there had been more truth in with the fiction it could have worked? I don't know if you will like this movie unless you're really just wanting some lightweight popcorn fodder and enjoy big explosions and over-hyped hero scenes. Overall an enjoyable watch but not something I'd raving about and I'm not going to be trying to get my friends to watch this one.",6,3,5,28 December 2016
