The Avengers," The decline of smart scripts begins here
","This movie is for people who can't grow up, there are no smart moves, only pure special effects with no meaning behind, a complete joke. This explains why there are so many 40 yo men living like children out there. Like a man in a much better film said: 'God **** it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy **** we don't need. We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual warÂ… our Great Depression is our lives.' Think about it, do you really want to have fun with this nonsense entertainment, without thinking even for a second?.",1,43,97,13 July 2012
American Sniper," Abhorrent pro war propaganda.
","Absolute garbage, I can't believe how low Americans have fallen. They are losing their humanity just because they can't admit they have been indoctrinated. They are utterly ignorant about their own history of interventions and their catastrophic consequences. Americans, please, learn to treat fellow humans like humans, not like cattle. Otherwise your legacy will be grim.Thankfully the US influence will keep declining as the East rises, the world needs it. Maybe then the heartless Americans that liked this movie will comprehend how non-exceptional they were and how ridiculous they will look to future generations. The saddest part is that your own children will inherit the deserved hatred that a lot of people have towards American nationalism.",1,18,49,18 February 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Another overrated and utterly forgettable American movie
","I'm really disappointed to see how highly rated this movie is. There was a time when great movies achieved that status by presenting a new perspective of life, by feeding you new thoughts and emotions, by showing the limits of human condition.Movies used (or at least tried) to resemble good books. Not anymore it seems. Now it has become over the top action with shallow characters (superheroes in a nutshell), who have little to do with our lives. Sheer entertainment is acceptable, but rating it as a masterpiece is the epitome of mediocrity, and it reinforces a dangerous trend where movies become a complete escape from reality instead of a different take on it.What makes us human more than anything is our curiosity, our desire for knowledge. This movie and other highly rated movies like The Avengers are a step backwards. How could it be otherwise when visual stimulation replaced brain stimulation? Hopefully foreign movies won't follow the same steps.",1,64,134,20 May 2015
