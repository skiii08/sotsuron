Miracle," it shoots, it scores
","When I first found out about this movie, I was reluctant to go see it because I could still remember too well the way the story played out in real life.  Even though it happened 24 (!) years ago already (and I was only five years old at the time), I can still remember the names of all the guys on the team: Eruzione and Craig and Ramsey and Broten and Christoff...I remember my Dad having to explain to me the concept of a tie after their game against Sweden.  And I remember, of course, the way they beat the Soviets on that February night in the most famous hockey game ever played. Up in our home in snowy, small town Minnesota, my family (even my mother and my sister!) gathered around our TV to watch the game, echoing each shout of `U-S-A!' as it came to us across the airwaves from Lake Placid.  When the U-S-A finally won the game, everyone in my family jumped up for joy and started spontaneously hugging each other in wild celebration.This movie can't quite make you that excited about hockey, but it gets pretty darn close.  Yeah, I finally caved and went to go see it once I started seeing all the positive reviews come in.  I found out that they were all well deserved.The tone of this movie reminded me quite a bit of another Disney sports film-the Rookie-in that it carefully places all of the sports drama within the broader context of family life.  While this will definitely help it appeal to a wider audience, it does mean that it's fairly short on hockey for most of its first half.  Nonetheless, once the movie gets out onto the ice, it does a terrific job of translating the speed and the excitement of the game onto the silver screen.  The attention to detail is really quite remarkable.  The moviemakers found dead-ringers to play guys like Mike Eruzione and James Craig.  The Minnesotan accent that Kurt Russell puts on in playing US coach Herb Brooks is really impressive (and amusing!).  And they even get the timing of each important goal right.I also admired the way they treated the Soviets--the nominal bad guys--in this film, too.  They weren't portrayed as blatantly evil in some hopelessly simplistic, Disney way, but rather, just the way they were: supremely confident, impassive and intimidating.  We also get to see that, despite all of their confidence, they're human, too.  They start cracking under the pressure when the American team keeps coming back, and we see them looking on forlornly when the USA players finally win and celebrate their `Miracle on Ice'.I've often thought that someone from another country could never really understand how much this hockey team meant (and still means) to Americans. In the years that have gone by since 1980, people have typically told this story in the context of how America was down on its luck at the end of the 70s and didn't really believe in itself anymore.  This movie will tell you much the same story.  One of the most fascinating sequences in the film, in fact, is an excerpt of a Jimmy Carter speech from 1979, in which he talks about how Americans have lost their characteristic confidence and faith in the future.But I've always remembered the Miracle on Ice as being much simpler-and much bigger-than all of that.  Thoreau once pointed out that people only really come together in times of great sorrow or great joy.  For instance, I'm sure that every American still remembers what it felt like when the country came together in the wake of the great tragedy of 9-11.  The Miracle on Ice was like that, but different-it was something that brought us all together simply because it brought us all great joy.  For those who can still remember what that felt like, 24 years ago, this movie is sure to bring the smiles back to their faces.  And for those who never got to experience it for real, the first time around, it may just make them want to jump up and hug someone. :-)",Null,0,0,8 February 2004
Lords of Dogtown," up and down
","This movie--and the documentary that preceded it--taught me a lot about the history of skateboarding but made me think about much more than that. On the surface, it tells the story of a group of young boys who created a unique skateboarding style in Venice Beach in the mid 1970s that went on to influence the whole world. But at its heart, this movie is a story about the American Dream, writ large across the concrete, urban face of the late twentieth century. It's about rising up from the bottom to the heights of glory and then coming back down to earth again. Much like a skateboard ride up and down the edge of an empty swimming pool.While this movie is spottier on the history of the Dogtown skateboarding style than the earlier documentary, it does help the viewer out by focusing the story on the three main dogs from the 'legendary' Zephyr skateboarding team: Tony Alva, Jay Adams and Stacey Peralta. It follows them as they serendipitously develop their own style of skateboarding in the schoolyards and backyards (and empty pools!) of their neighborhood, Dogtown, and then go on to revolutionize the world of skateboarding with it. And then it shows you how they struggle to deal with the trappings of their own success.Since the story is based on actual events, the movie's 'plot' doesn't follow the typical narrative structure of having everything lead up to a climax, or a happy ending, or what have you. So the viewer is mostly left with a portrait of the three main characters' distinct personalities, and their unique approaches to dealing with the events that are rapidly unfolding all around them. Which only seems appropriate, since skateboarding is a sport where the object of the game is to express your own personal style.What's interesting about the way the story progresses is that it shows that each of the main characters' strengths is also a weakness--whether that be Alva's egotism, Adams' recklessness, or Peralta's reliability. Thankfully, the movie doesn't try to wrap up all those flaws neatly by making it seem like 'that's why they all needed each other', or something obnoxiously happy like that. It's just the way they are. And they each have to live with the consequences, good and bad.Another aspect of this movie that I like is the way that it captures the randomness and spontaneity of the small kernel of creative insight that led to a revolution. In that way it reminds you that there will always be something pure and right burning at the heart of whatever the characters decide to do with their lives. I think (or hope) that everybody has moments of clarity in their lives like that. Like the moment that you realized you were in love with the person you would eventually marry. Or the excitement you felt when you first discovered the work that would become your career. Those moments that you can always go back to when you can no longer see through the institutional build-up in your soul.In that sense I feel like this is a movie with a universal message to tell. A message about how to synthesize the passion and freedom and creativity of youth with real life.Good stuff.",7,1,12,3 June 2005
