Scarface," The little epic that couldn't
","I had never seen 'Scarface' before but of course had heard a lot about it. After watching it I have to say that it's a very good vicious gangster movie.  The problem is that it's a very bad epic.The first part of the movie is good, but eventually the movie switches out of the rise of Tony Montana and becomes a sort of morality tale that just doesn't fly.  Every time that the 'truth' about Tony's world was shown by one plot device or another, my reaction was 'yeah, I know.'  There wasn't really anything interesting in all of it, just a pretentious effort determined to make itself an epic.  The most blatant evidence of this comes in the tagline: 'the world will remember him by another name...Scarface.' This is what I would refer to as epic cheese.  You can't sit down and say 'I'm going to create an epic now.'  The good movie comes first, and if it is done well enough the epic feel results.Scarface has some great stuff in it, but in the end it rings hollow. There's a great deal of high-minded thought and not enough real substance behind it.  The sister is a good example, seeming to transform for no apparent reason, as the character isn't really given enough scenes to develop.  Scarface is the same way--much of it feels more like a highlight reel than a film.  It's what would have happened if all three Godfathers would have been condensed into a single 3-hour film.  The result is disappointing, but it's still something worth watching, if only to get to say hello to Pacino's little friend.  5/10",5,2,5,21 August 2002
Chinatown," Explanation of the title
","I'm not going to bother to do a full review.  Suffice it to say that it is brilliant, and is even more enjoyable on a second viewing so that it is easier to follow.  This one is a 10.****STOP HERE TO AVOID POSSIBLE SPOILERS****One of the common remarks is that the title is nonsensical and has nothing to do with the movie.  For people who expect the title to be part of the explicit plot, this is true.  But Chinatown is a metaphor.  It's the seedy side of humanity, a place that Nicholson descends back into.  As a result, he ends up getting burned.  The idea is that there's not much he can do, it's just the way it is.  Hence, the brilliant line 'It's just Chinatown.' Since, on a level deeper than the action itself, the movie is really about this ugly side of humanity, the title is more than appropriate.",Null,0,2,13 September 2002
Sleepy Hollow," Ugh
","I recognize that I'm definitely in the minority here, but I thought this movie was terrible.  It's pretty rare that I shut a movie off, but I didn't think that this one was worth my time.To me, the movie's pace seemed to be at cross purposes with its subject. There seemed to be more frolicking than terror.  It just rapidly leaped from sequence to sequence, maintaining a very light-hearted feel the entire time. There was far too much romping for me to feel any suspense, and the only horror that the story was capable of producing came from its God-awful quality.***SKIP NEXT PARAGRAPH TO AVOID SPOILERS***  Let's see here...there's an investigator whose new methods are contrary to his superiors.  He's a person that has lots of fun little gadgets of his own design.  His mother died because she was wrongly accused.  Is there anything even remotely resembling originality here?  Not even Depp could rescue this cardboard character.  And I will grant that there was an original treatment of the actual legend by going with crime investigation, but this was also terrible.  The investigation seemed to move forward by very, very thin strands of logic that struck me as ridiculous.  Finally, this movie has a love story even worse than the one in Pearl Harbor.  Depp and Ricci meet, and by the third scene together they are in love for no apparent reason.I'm not particularly familiar with Tim Burton, but between this and the disgusting remake of Planet of the Apes, I don't think I want to.  The story is ludicrous, the characters shallow pieces of trash, and the mood right out of a Ren and Stimpy cartoon.  I have nothing against Ren and Stimpy, but that's because they weren't trying to be scary.This one was too busy trying to be hip to be any good. 2/10",2,3,6,15 August 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Rather good movie, spectacular adaptation
","I'd been meaning to read the book for years, and I made sure to actually do it prior to viewing the film.  I was impressed...there is an absolute wealth of story in the book, and no movie could even come close to including it all, but the feel of the book was there.  The first 20 minutes of the movie seemed pretty rushed, but it successfully drew me in.  The characters had come to life.However, it's far from a perfect movie.  On my second and third viewings the poor dialogue started to show up in some places.  And it's really, really bad.  In particular, there's Aragorn speaking to Legolas and Gimli...'Let's hunt some orc.'  That has to be one of the most horrendous lines I've ever heard.Still, the film is beautiful to look at, wonderfully directed, and a better adaptation of the book than I would have thought humanly possible.  It doubtlessly doesn't deserve the #4 rating on IMDB, but it's still an excellent movie.  Numerous people will hate this movie, but most will be swept into Tolkein's beautiful and epic fantasy world. 7/10",7,0,0,26 August 2002
American Beauty," Still my favorite
","It's been a few years since I've seen American Beauty now, and I've seen a lot of movies in that time span (it's what happens when you work in a video store).  This is still my favorite.  It's not a style of movie that everyone can enjoy and is largely a love it/hate it film.  But it's got amazing acting in a well-written script that includes not only a great deal of humor, but a depth that is almost unheard of in movies.  With the numerous layers incorporated in the film, you can spend days thinking about this movie, and there's still no beating the feeling that comes to you during the final words. 10/10",10,0,0,22 July 2002
American History X," Racism hitting you in the gut
","I love this movie.  I'm not going to declare it 'perfect' or one of the best films of all time, but it's nevertheless truly great.  About the first 20 minutes are pretty bad...the story is set up in a clunky manner reminiscent of after-school specials.  The all-wise principal is also artificial, but he is a minor enough character that he doesn't detract too much from the film. I also had a problem with the music in a couple of places, particularly on the basketball court.  I recognize that the usual term is 'dramatic score,' but this score heaped the drama on way too early in some places.  Like the movie itself, however, the music recovers and begins to simply fit.Ed Norton is the one who made this movie brilliant.  Sometimes when one actor dominates the screen so much the other portions of the movie suffer (personally, I'm thinking of Washington vs. the Canadians in 'Hurricane'), but in this case Furlong was compelling enough to avoid this problem, as one of the two was almost always on the screen.  The Eds are great, and Norton's nomination was well deserved.****SKIP NEXT PARAGRAPH TO AVOID SPOILERS****The most common complaint about this film seems to be that the character's turnaround was not believable, that it was 'overnight.'  I couldn't disagree more.  It was not overnight, but over the 1095 nights of his sentence. Derek had a lot of time to think, and that's what undercut his ideology. His Nazi brethren were ignoring the tenets of his belief system, exposing them for what they were--people latching on to an idea for identity, not for the merits of the idea.  As a thinking individual and former honors student, Derek needed to justify his feelings of hatred with logic.  Cameron's teachings fit the bill nicely.  Then he realized that people didn't care about the ideology so much as the image.  Shortly after that his Nazi friends rape him.  As he lays unconcious on the shower room floor, the word that came to my mind was 'wreck.'  Derek was completely wrecked and destroyed.  In his fragile state, who comes to visit him?  A black man.  He initially questions why his former teacher bothered to come, but as the shivering and tearful mass that he is at that point, the friend is sorely needed.  Does it all feel slightly contrived?  The emotional content of the sequence prevents the viewer from feeling the artificiality, but a cerebral examination of the events ends with an answer of 'yes.'  The teacher is too wise and saintly not to be questioned. Disbelief of the teacher's character suspended, is the transformation believable?  Yes.American History X doesn't just tell you that hate is bad.  It may overtly state that 'hate is baggage,' but it's a message of summary, not instruction.  The movie lets those who watch it truly FEEL that hatred causes pain, and does it as well as I have ever seen it done.  Ordinarily a beginning as poor as this movie's first 20 minutes would greatly lower my opinion of the remainder, but not here.  The rest of the movie is just that good.  9/10",9,0,0,12 August 2002
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," The best movie you never thought you'd actually watch
","Admittedly, I am a sucker for 'finding yourself' movies, so I am predisposed to like 'Hedwig.'  But that doesn't mean that it isn't a great movie.  A lot more people should watch this than ever will, for fairly obvious reasons. To be honest, it's something that I usually wouldn't bothered with.  But once you get past it being a movie about a transexual rock star you realize that 'Hedwig' is about as touching a movie as they make.  Besides featuring great songs, the movie features an EXTREMELY impressive acting job on the part of John Cameron Mitchell.  He gives Hedwig (near) universal appeal and allows the audience to identify with her in a way that I wouldn't have thought possible.  Given the absurd scenario presented in 'Hedwig,' most people will expect a zany musical.  But this one is so much more...Not everyone is going to like this film, but if you would ever contemplate renting this movie it means you should.  It's original funny, and strangely moving.  Even if you're not a vegan art student with a nose ring and pink hair.",8,0,1,23 July 2002
Signs," 1/4 part Hitchcock, 2 parts SNL, 3 parts disappointment
","I don't regret going to see this movie and was entertained by it, but it should have been an awful lot more.  It's been promoted for more than a year now in previews, and the recent cover of Newsweek displayed M. Night Shymalan.  The headline: The Next Spielberg.  The truth: yeah, right.The opening credits felt like a Hitchcock movie to me: plain black and white credits, the suspenseful (though already familiar) theme song playing.  That was where the similarity ended.  The first half of the movie had suspenseful moments, but every single one of these was diluted by comedy to the point of becoming meaningless.  The most egregious example came early, when Gibson and Phoenix invesigated a possible intruder outside the house.  The scene began with a moment that I will confess made me jump.  It proceeded to become one huge joke playing off of Gibson's docile nature (more on that later).  The audience should have been on the edge of its seats; instead it was laughing.  The viewer remembers the scene, but only as a cerebral memory, not as a gut feeling.  The mood is completely killed.  Shymalan doesn't even try to recover the mood: the next scene features a recounting of the events meant to evoke more laughter.  I understand that people thought 'Unbreakable' too slow and somber, but this was not the answer. Imagine Will Ferrel narrating 'The Others' and you'll get the idea.Without the accompanying mood, the suspense was lost.  The last third of the movie was designed to make me jump a few times, but it was ridiculously predictable and failed.  There was also supposed to be a great deal of conflict over Mel Gibson's faith, but this was also ineffective.  The conclusion seemed contrived, but I won't complain about that because its artificial nature was part of the point.  Nevertheless, it was far from a great ending.  ***SKIP NEXT PARAGRAPH TO AVOID SPOILERS***The characters were extremely disappointing.  Early in the movie, Shymalan makes a big point of Gibson's inability to be angry.  Later, he flips out on his children during the dinner scene.  I understand that he's under stress, but what he does amounts to psychological abuse.  But since Shymalan's so concerned with family relationships, his son of course walks over and gives his dad a hug so they can cry together.  Given that his son is at oldest ten, this is beyond precocity.  Considering the treatment his dad gave him, the kid would have been much more likely to throw a plate at him, and it would have been deserved.  As for Joaquin Phoenix, his part was more of a clown than a real character.  After his brilliant performances in 'Gladiator' and 'Quills' (side note, despite Phoenix, stay away from the latter), his talent is sadly wasted in 'Signs.'  The little girl was also disappointing.  In the basement she talks about 'this was in my dream.' There has been next to no setup to this, and there is no followup either. She just sort of hangs in the wind.  Lastly, the alien was disappointing. The only suspense that the movie actually has comes from NOT knowing what they look like.  As soon as we get a good look at one, the entire effect is blown.  In the Newsweek article, Shymalan cites 'Psycho' as one of his favorite films.  Perhaps he should consider what damage would have been done to the shower scene if we saw the knife actually strike.The movie shows humor, displays conflict in the former priest, and is occasionally suspenseful, but only the first of these is done well.  Instead of weaving all of these elements in one masterpiece, Shymalan made 'Signs' into three different movies, and I was never quite sure which one I was supposed to be watching.  Wait for video on this one. Without expectations: 5/10 With expectations: 2/10",5,1,1,4 August 2002
