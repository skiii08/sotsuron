The Finest Hours," the finest hours:wont be fine hour at 1952
","one of the good rescue movie based on the true story first it was great screenplay,Visual effect and screen color would make believe in 1952 i am hearing turbine,engine,Pump from Casey Affleck acting scope explored in this movie very well, Ben foster having role of aside to Chris pine saying we need to get back there will be heavy storm that's shows his fear normal man would feel this always. Chris pine seen already in unstoppable same effect of acting explored here and heroic perfectly suits for him scene by scene his handshake makes having fear that's the real story behind.likes: heroine beauty,rescue mission, Screenplay, Chris pine. dislikes: how accident was done has not been shown very clearly, Love emotion is not shown very deeply would add more gripping to the storylineoverall good movie to watch.",7,0,0,23 October 2016
Southpaw," Southpaw-rocked
","good to see this movie because am one of boxer had these emotions when i fight in the ring. Jake Gyllenhall acting was good(ex: Prince of Persia) always Rachel McAdams has been used as small part in this movie but acting wise scope is not their example 'the vow' after Cinderella, million dollar baby,rocky it brings same effect but little bit missing otherwise it is very good.Anger management always been part of all game here it is shown very well mainly defense seems to be bottom of the story line.Forest Whitaker taken position as coach but in this movie he taken serious and always showing his class i have been following from taken3,vantage point. Likes: family emotion, father child relationship, nail biting scenes during ring fight and always friends.",8,2,2,24 October 2015
The Dark Knight," Dark knight is awesome movie to watch
","The Joker(Heath Ledger) acting is superb .. apart from other superhero batman using their mind and technology.some of the idea they included are awesome like bank robbing , site shooting , escaping from prison, the dark knight (batman) tracing the bullet for hand stamp .tech they used like from car they catch a bike format (initiating sequence ) hero 'Bruce Wayne / Batman ' looks like slim even he wears a coat suit superb(plus point) thing is, in all other superhero movie they give hard voice to villain (enemy) soft voice to hero , but in batman it is reversed story is taken from comics but there is no fantasy also one of the plus point minus point - it is vary from Christopher Nolan film (like memento)",10,1,4,24 July 2008
