Blade Runner 2049," Blade Runner 2049 Review
","I'm going to keep it simple. This film has spectacular visuals, some of the best I've ever seen, maybe even the best I've ever seen. The sound design is equally as engaging. Though I'm disappointed to say that every other aspect of this film is painfully mediocre. You're not going to find any unique story telling in this film, it isn't anything a casual movie goer hasn't seen before. There is one decent twist in the whole two hour and forty three minute run time, but it wasn't good enough to excuse the dreadful pacing. There are a great many scenes where we watch a character quite literally do nothing for a good couple of minutes. A lot of time is wasted. I get exactly what the film is trying to do though unfortunately it's just not very entertaining and these scenes do not justify the lengthy run time. Everything besides the sound and visuals are underwhelming to say the least, even the action scenes are underwhelming, and there isn't very many of them. Ultimately Blade Runner 2049 is a stunning visual experience that is aided by equally great sound design that immerses you into its world. Unfortunately, in terms of story telling and characters, despite the actors doing a phenomenal job, everything else about this movie is average.",6,4,11,6 October 2017
