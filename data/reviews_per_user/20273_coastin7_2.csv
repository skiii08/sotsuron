Ford v Ferrari," Excellent
","I'm glad they paid homage to Ken Miles in this movie, his story was phenomenal. It would have been a shame not to credit him with what he and Shelby did for Ford.",8,1,3,22 March 2020
The Lion King," Not bad.
","I thought this movie was good, not great. The ending felt too rushed, they wrapped up the ending too quick to for it to feel like Simbas return was triumphant. Also all the voice acting was awesome except for childish Gambino, his voice was distracting and detracted from the movie.",7,0,3,23 July 2019
