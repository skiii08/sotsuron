Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's Star Wars
","This film is not the best film ever made (neither were the originals) but it does stay in the mold of Star Wars. The Worlds they visit are rich in detail, with many strange races in funny costumes (much like the originals). The effects are ground breaking (just like the originals), not just in their quality but in their quantity (literally every frame has some computer alterations of some form). Also, unlike many summer blockbusters recently, there is a bit of a story, albeit a pretty simple one (just like the originals). The problems really come with the dialogue because it sucks (just like the originals). Someone really should have said 'erm George nice universe and idea and all, but you can't write for toffee'. Unfortunately no one did so we are stuck with a film full of pointless repetitions of what other characters have just said and dialogue with no emotion. All this stops the dialogue from flowing so its sounds stilted and dumb. Ah well what more could we have expected. (A script doctor perhaps?)Oh and why did they make Darth Vadar Jesus (virgin birth and all that)?And why exactly do they need to bring balance to the force as the darkside have been doing nothing for a millenia?",7,0,0,18 July 1999
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Take a butchers!
","If you want to dee a great, distinctly British, film, take a butchers at this. Comparisons to Pulp Fiction are fair but the films are different, especially as this is set in a fictional east-end London. They both show a strange underworld which probably doesn't exist, but this film is much more amusing (Pulp Fiction doesn't have a guy being beaten to death with a dildo). Some may find the end annoying (I wont spoil it for you) and you Yanks will have trouble understanding it (Trainspotting was a different accent, this is in a different language) but if you do watch it I guarantee you will be laughing out loud. The violence is brutal but mainly off screen but anyone who can't stand strong language would be advised not to see the film, as most of the dialogue is unrepeatable in good company.Basically the film is great fun, so get on the dog&bone and take a butchers with your mates. (If you dont understand dog&bone or butchers though, dont bother)",10,1,2,25 March 1999
