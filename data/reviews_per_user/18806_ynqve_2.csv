The New World," Beautiful but deeply flawed
","I had been warned that this film was a snoozefest, but I just thought that's because people nowadays are so used to loud action movies from directors like Michael Bay that they have a problem with any slow paced narrative. But this movie is not slow, because that would require some movement. It is just standing still most of the time, which is a shame because it could have been so good! Don't get me wrong, there are some great aspects to the film, visually it's a stunner! The cinematography is really really good, there are so many beautiful shots and scenes. But when it comes to plot and narrative something is deeply wrong. I think you could have cut out at least an hour without disturbing the plot at all. It is too long! And just because you have nice nature shots with a voice-over that says something like 'mother, you are everywhere' once every minute doesn't make it deep. It just make the film boring. Also I would have preferred less focus on the relationship between Pocahontas and Smith (which consists of them staring at each other with 'deep' voice overs), and instead have more focus on the relationship between the settlers and natives. However, I think that the part with Christian Bale is a lot better and far more interesting. Sadly most viewers won't see it because they are probably sleeping by then. I think they could have shown more of Pocahontas in London, the clash of cultures is an interesting subject. Lastly, I saw the extended cut, avoid it like plague. It doesn't add anything interesting, it just make the film even longer.",6,1,1,17 October 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Exceeds expectations
","As a huge Tolkien fan, it was with mixed fear and excitement that I went to see the Hobbit: an unexpected journey, last night. I was really worried about how Jackson was going to extend the Hobbit into three films. But in retrospect, there was no reason to worry at all! There is not a dull moment in the entire film. The story is not as dark as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but it still have the same feel to it. You do feel like you're back in the same Middle-earth as before, but things are not yet as grim and desperate as in the old films. Some people might complain about there being too much comedy and slapstick but you need to remember that the Hobbit was written as a children's book. I like the fact that they expand upon some story lines that does not have the same weight in the book, such as the white council and some of the issues between dwarfs and elves, but it still remain true to the original story. Obviously the film is visually stunning and the 3d and 48 fps work really well. I enjoyed it a lot and look forward to the next part!",9,5,15,14 December 2012
