Deja Vu," What else should you expect out of a movie?
","I saw the movie at a Preview Screening at CSULB, despite the numerous technical difficulties, the movie was pretty good.When you hear Bruckheimer's name associated with anything, you usually expect something cutting edge that does not insult your intelligence, and this movie delivers on that. The plot, while not perfect or fully believable, had my interests up quickly. It has a hint of CSI flavor as the audience gets to see evidence and how it got there.I will agree with the other poster, in that the character development was pretty weak. The audience gets very little insight as to the lives of the characters, as well as what drives them to do the things they do. The acting was okay, but I cannot help but picture Washington on the football field in scenes where he chews gum.Back to the plot; the whole premise of the movie has little in common with the phrase Dejavu in that the audience is not convinced enough that the characters actually feel like what they are experiencing has happened before. It was odd how they turned a seemingly simple crime investigation in the beginning to an elaborate time travel plot. Much of the physics involved makes sense, yet some do not. However, keep in mind that it is a movie, made to entertain and not compel people's minds.Overall it was a decent movie. Once again no movie is perfect, and this movie had its highs and its lows. As described it is a huge mix of genres: action, drama, sci-fi, and some humor which works well enough to keep you on the edge of your seat.",7,3,7,14 November 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," A great funny movie
","This has got to be one of Will Ferrell's best movies. Do not believe this isn't a great movie based on what others have said. This is a comedy, not some serious drama based on a book looking to get in depth and analytical about life. This is a true funny film that has the usual morals, and delivers what it promises.First off the previews did not make this very enticing to see, yet what else do you do when you are bored on a Friday night? While the scenes in the preview commercials would seem to desensitize one, they did a good job in leaving all the highlights out of the movie. There a numerous funny scenes and lines which follow what was shown on TV.The acting itself is great since Ferrell does a good job in creating a cocky and arrogant man who matures throughout the movie, yet it is the clever lines presented by all the characters which make it amusing. There are non stop laughs in the movie with few repeating gags. The two boys in the movie are hilarious as is all the support cast.I do have some peeves though. The kissing scenes were just wrong. Now I am not against that stuff, but I don't think it was appropriate to have it presented in that manner and in front of some kids. Some of the one liners are a bit stupid and not all that funny. Finally, I know this is a movie, and as I have said not a serious one, but many of the crash scenes and things that occur on the track and in other car scenes seem unbelievable.If you are looking to laugh for 2 hours straight this is the movie, definitely a future classic!",8,2,6,4 August 2006
