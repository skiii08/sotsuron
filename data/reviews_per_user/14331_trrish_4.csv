Ghost," after 13 years...
","13 years ago, I think I thought this was a cute movie.   Tonight I watched it during a bout of insomnia and wow, is it bad or what!  I think if you were to sum up what happened to Patrick Swayze's career in one word, it would be 'Ghost'.  The acting is laughable.   Whoopi is redeeming but can't get past the ridiculous script.  The little black ghosty dudes that come get the bad guys have to be one of the worst decisions a special effects crew ever made.Verdict:  Repeat viewings are not necessary.  Leave well enough alone.",1,12,31,30 March 2003
That Thing You Do!," Like a fine wine...
","For me, this movie just gets better with age. I thought it was underrated. The music is so well done, thanks to Adam Schlesinger (see 'Fountains of Wayne'). I've always wanted to be able to thank Tom Hanks for the movie and the music. They both inspired my then 2 year old son to take up the drums. He's still playing. I loved the music because although it was all original, it sounded like those songs had somehow been part of my life, growing up in the 60's. I like Tom Everett Scott as Guy. Steve Zahn is very funny, and Jonathon Schaech is appropriately moody. There are also some great supporting roles - I love Freddie Frederickson ('Mr. Downtown'), the hotel doorman, the LA DJ and Barry Sobel as Goofball. Have I mentioned the music?? :-) If you haven't given this movie a chance and you are a fan of pop music, try it out.",9,1,2,8 March 2003
School of Rock," If you love rock, you'll have fun
","Come on, Ted!  Lighten up!Anyone who loves rock will enjoy this, IMO.  Jack is lovable, the kids are fun and the music is great.  Don't think too much - just rent it and enjoy it.   If you've ever wanted to be in a band, check it out.  I've got two kids and we've been rocking out for ten years.  Glad to see someone's made a movie about turning kids on to rock - and a lot of us have these kids inside of us.  All the 70's references are fun for us old geezers.  'Put your hand over your hearts... I pledge allegiance ... to the band....of Mr. Schneebly...and will not fight him...for creative control...LET'S GET ROCKING!'",Null,0,0,4 March 2004
Happy Feet," Rolling my eyes at the political divide
","It amuses me that many of the 'reviewers' complain about the message in the movie but send their own hateful message in their posts. 'If you didn't like this movie, you are a clueless (read: Republican) soccer mom!!!'.Stop that. Since when do mothers with kids who play soccer have the same freakin' political point of view? I'm a mom with a kid who plays soccer. I am almost as liberal as you can get, I think. I agree with the 'message' of this movie. And, I didn't like this movie! I didn't really like it the first time I saw it when it was called 'March of the Penguins!' (Ok, these penguins sing and dance.) Yep, the animation was superb. Some of the music was fun. I don't like musical/tap-dancing movies that much to begin with, so it doesn't make it any better for me when they are animated penguins.The story didn't make sense to me - 'hey, those penguins are dancing. We must be overfishing!'. Plus, this is the kind of film that makes me embarrassed to be a green liberal. The message is delivered in a way that is guaranteed to turn off, oh, at least about 51% of the population.Also, is there a word for sexually anthropomorphizing? That's what they did to the female penguins. Hollywood, you are driving me crazy.Lastly, instead of hiring Robin Williams to do four characters, why not hire an actual Latino or African American? I like Robin Williams, but him doing a stereotyped Latino penguin was irking me.Really lastly, some of the scenes are downright scary and sad. 'Happy Feet' is something of a misnomer for much of the film.There are plenty of animated films I've loved. This was not one of them.But I give everyone else plenty of room to absolutely love it. We can all coexist without hating each other.",4,1,2,6 April 2007
