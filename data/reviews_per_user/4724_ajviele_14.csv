Ford v Ferrari," Maybe the best race movie ever.
","In a time where very few good movies come to us, this is a gem. This is a throwback movie if your looking for a movie tainted by nonsense this ain't it. Bale should win an oscar for this performance. Ck it out its probably the best overall movie this year.",10,3,5,2 December 2019
A Star Is Born," Wow
",Very engaging movie I enjoyed it until the very end and it has maybe the worst ending in movie history.,2,1,4,9 June 2019
The Irishman," Trash
",45 mins in you could have edited every minute of it its drivel. The acting is AWFUL Deniro is terrible this was a part he could have nailed 25 years ago for sure. He attempts to play a tough guy its totally unbelievable. Hes ready for dipends and pudding cups. The makeup and making them old then you it's bad it looks terrible. Pacino is confusing he keeps changing how he speaks wtf?? Peci looks like hes ready for a nap in every scene. 3.5 hrs could have been edited to lie 90 mins at best. Back to Al his performance makes u glad Jimmy got concrete shoes.,3,3,9,5 December 2019
Aquaman," Are people on drugs?
",I had no expectations for this movie but people really liked this so I watched it. This is like a syfy channel caliber movie I would say its comparable to a movie like sharknado. Everything about this movie is bad the cgi looks like a 8 year old did it.,2,1,4,17 February 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Sad
",This is a pathetic SM movie. I felt like I was babysitting for 2 hrs. Holland is annoying.,2,3,8,27 May 2019

",One of the most underrated movies ever made. This is an amazing movie top to bottom.,10,0,0,5 July 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Like watching paint dry
",This is literally one of the worst movies I have ever seen. QT is a hack I could edit 2hrs of this movie out. Pitt wins an oscar for what?,1,6,9,12 February 2020
Joker," This is not entertainment
","The acting and cinematic experience is fantastic. This movie is so dark that its uncomfortable to watch. In so many ways it's a good joker, and in even more ways it's an awful joker. This was a blank slate,they had the opportunity to give us a great joker orgin movie instead it's a character study of a guy going crazy. There's no story,no villains, no plot, nothing. Don't waste your money.",5,9,24,9 October 2019
Creed II," Best movie of the year
",With all the garbage Hollywood is throwing out this is a terrific movie.,9,1,3,6 December 2018
Midway," Wow
","This movie has some of the best cinematography, and visuals ever made wo question, the angles are fantastic. I'm actually surprised the America haters in Hollywood made this, this should win big time awards but it wont because it does not meet the social justice qualifications it actually has men that are men and act like it. Go see it and support this flick it's very good.",9,6,9,25 November 2019
