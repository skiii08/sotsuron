50 First Dates," A guy who has to make a girl fall in love with him every day...Sounds intriguing, huh?
","A very nice movie to watch. Actually, I'm more into deep, profound movies, and still this one touched me by its amazing story. I felt it very genuine, an interesting idea, a breeze of freshness. This guy, Henry Roth( Adam Sandler) works at a Marine Center in Hawaii, and in the beginning of the movies appears as a Casanova, seducing every day another girl. All this, until one day he get over Lucy (Drew Barrymore) in a small dinner. She takes his breath away, and from now on, several mornings he takes his breakfast there, watching Lucy, until one day gets the chance to talk to her. They hit it off right away, and they have a great time speaking for a couple of hours, and the break up with the promise to get the breakfast there, the day after, at the same hour. But surprise, the next day, she doesn't recognize him anymore....It comes out that she has some memory problems, and from now on, all things get an interesting turn; but I won't spoil your pleasure of seeing what is all about.You must watch it!10/10",10,0,0,21 March 2004
