Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas does it again.
","I found that the film had a slow beginning, but it quickly built up the pace.  The special effects were awesome.We see the beginnings of the Empire within the Trade Federation and Darth Sidious/Palpatine using it for personal gains.Although some of the characters are kind of slow to grasp, Jar Jar Binks, it wouldn't be the same film without them.I would definitely recommend this film to anyone.",10,0,0,15 October 1999
