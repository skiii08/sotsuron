Requiem for a Dream," not bad but maybe excessive in places
","This film is an offbeat one set in a near future where the only thing on television is a wacky game show. I suppose in such an odd future it is not crazy to expect people to behave in a strange ways. There is plenty of strange in this movie, so much so it reminded me of David Lynch's film work. maybe the film maker was inspired by David Lynch. I saw some of Darren Aronofsky's experimental film work at a film festival in Toronto a little while ago. He comes up with some interesting stuff. Reqeuim is not an easy film to watch, because it is harsh and because it is also artsy, which is an unusual combination. I found myself drawn into the films story and at the same time repelled by the way it ended. I suppose it could not go any other way, but it is a bleak message, lacking in any kind of redemption for the characters inner and outer troubles. It all ends up in one big stinking mess. It is dark work and not entirely rewarding, but it is probably some of the more important film work that has been done lately, anywhere. I gave it a six because I think there is always the possibility of change. This film says not. I think in that respect, it is not correct.",Null,0,1,16 August 2009
Inglourious Basterds," An absolutely terrible movie
","I went to see this one because a Tarantino film is usually a good bang for a couple of bucks-what I saw was a film that tried very hard to be serious film and failed badly, in fact it was like watching old footage of a B-17 get hit by flack and roll upside down as a prelude to flying vertically into the ground at three times its top speed, on fire. The inclusion of Mike Myers as an actor doing a serious role was truly laughable in and of itself. The fact that some US soldier liked to carve swastikas into German soldiers heads is something that I have never heard before and I have heard all kinds of WW2 stories. Well, big deal on that anyway, I could imagine lots of worse things to do to German soldiers in WW2 than giving them improvised tattoos and hitting them with baseball bats. The portrayal of Adolf Hitler as funny man and also the portrayal of Joseph Goebels as funny man treads a fine line dipping into the and of ass jokes with remarkable ease, showing a bit of true bad taste on the part of the film maker. Whats next-pratfall jokes with Joseph Stalin?, who by the way, killed 27 million people, out doing Hitler's period of distemper by quite a few more million dead persons. Boo hiss on this flap doodle. Only good bit is when two guys gets their testes shot off in a bar scene-and not a vampire in sight.I honestly think this film does not contribute to the body of work that deals with WW2. Maybe in kind of a cheapish way it does, but I wouldn't want a WW2 vet to see it.",Null,13,24,14 September 2009
Shaun of the Dead," Good but not excellent
","The filmmakers really played on the fact that British people are often impossible to good effect within the parameters of this movie. Unfortunately the way in which British people are frequently impossible is not always something you can forgive, and that element makes this film good but not excellent. That someone could be every annoying thing and not be also considered a form of evil is maybe what this film is mocking, so maybe it is further ahead of the curve than I am giving it initial credit for. Good acting from the team of actors that also made the film Hot Fuzz, which is the better film to me. I found the annoying traits that are played upon in this movie to be a bit much at about the one hour point, but like I said maybe they are trying to make fun of just how irritating people can be, as they are in effect personifying evil by having so many traits that are supposedly there to ward away evil. That nothing is ever said about anything is pure England, and is like dealing with the just deceased in a way, and that the continuous counter reaction of everything is fine, when it most definitely is not, has the ultimate effect of destroying every scrap of possible good in a situation. Good zombie film, funny in places, with an interesting and intelligent sardonic sub text.",Null,1,3,23 July 2010
Hostel," a waste of film stock
","This film gets my vote for worst film of the current era of film making. Not only is it without imagination it is the personification of gratuitous gore and it has a mindless story line. I feel sorry for the young actors involved with this project, and I feel sorry for the movie going public who has to put up with movies of such poor quality. When you plonk down 10.00 it would be nice to think you are getting something that has some thought involved. This film also marks the start of a trend I call modern junk, which to me is comprised of what is essentially bad student movies that have ben tagged for development by the big studios.There are many films like this out now in the horror style, and none of the are any good. When I went to see this one, I left halfway through it, it was that rotten.",Null,1,4,15 August 2009
Public Enemies," Interesting take on gangsters of the 30's
","This is an interestingly well done movie that just happens to be about gangsters. Well, just kidding-it really is a well done gangster movie-with some of the best cinematography I have ever seen in any film-quite something really-like you are standing right there with them back in the 1930's. Great shoot out scenes, and it shows what a fledgling organization the early FBI was-who by the way, adopted a picture of John Dillinger for use as a pistol target for their shooting ranges. If this film is correct, they killed John Dilinger with several surprise shots while he was walking down the street in the evening-one shot to the back of the head and one through his chest entering via his back-which is not quite the same as giving someone a trial. The acting was perfect and the scenes were well thought out. I think was worth a look.",Null,0,2,17 September 2009
Pirate Radio," Like being hit with silly string on a public bus
","Its funny...I can remember looking up some old interview tapes on You Tube of Robert Plant in the late 1960s done by the BBC TV network in England when Led Zeppelin had just got of the ground,and thinking that whoever made this film had not done much in the way of research into what England was like in the 60s. I thought this film was a very well intentioned albeit total joke of a film that should have been stopped at the early production levels because it contained such gross misreadings of England re its views on rock music. If anything England cold be accused of being yes men where its rockers were concerned. Anything that Mick Jagger did was one the news back then, and he was one of the few rock musicians who got into hot water for being too much of a free spirit. You know what they say..any publicity is good if you are a musician, but I doubt this film will do much for record sales of old rock bands since it alienates anyone who is familiar with the British music scene in its early days. British people like to party and that has never been a secret. According to this tome of a movie that is not the case.",Null,3,6,18 December 2009
500 Days of Summer," The movie is named after the female lead...
","...and it is a fairly well crafted movie. It is nice to see someone making a movie about just how unpredictable a relationship can be-and the one the male lead gets into in this movie is really something. Good acting keeps the pace moving along well and the cinematography is just off beat enough to keep the whole thing from being bogged down in visual clich√©s. Probably good for many different fans of cinema, from artsy types to more conventional thinkers. It is refreshing all in all and I recommend it. The film captures the way people kind of live in little bubbles more and more-from home to work to home maybe out from time to time. It is poetic but not self indulgent which is kind of uncommon.",Null,0,2,4 November 2009
The Terminator," Its a period piece to me somehow
","...the same way other films somehow seemed to sum up the hopes and fears of a particular generation. Not really much in the way of special effects, and the script is sort of basic, but it works on the level of a good SF film nonetheless. Maybe because it uses the idea of time travel. There were a number of sequels, which all seemed to add to the original idea, with the possible exception of the fourth film which creates so many complexities to that particular time travel experience the whole thing becomes incomprehensible in terms of the logic of that particular time travel time line. It ends up being I am my own grandpa type of thing. Anyway Linda Hamilton is good as the female lead in Terminator, and Arnie says, well, just about three words in the entire film. A good film to see if you are bored on a summer night. I think everybody can identify with the fear of The End Of The World given the ultra armed state of things, so in that way the film addresses that issue, albeit in a way that involves time travel and machines running amok. I think I can't really give it an eight because of its kind of cheap model special effects.",Null,0,2,22 August 2009
Silent Hill," Based on a real coal fire in PA, USA.
","One of the things I found good about this film was the opening sequence where a woman driving with a daughter is approached by a female motorcycle cop and queried about if the girl with her is really a daughter. I think that the director caught an element of paranoia that does seem to exist at some levels in terms of how some Police view ordinary citizens. In the film, a dimensional rift opens up, so the cop following the woman and daughter, and the woman and daughter, are all shunted off into another version of Earth, causing the causality chain to be broken, changing what would happen next, since the motorcycle cop was following the woman driving with a daughter, with a view to 'throwing a spanner into the works of a crime in progress', when there was no crime in progress. The film asks the question, how far is too far?...where local law enforcement is concerned, among other things. I think it is an abysmal thing to do to another human being. I think similar things might also occur in the world pertaining to single parent families, consisting of a father and a son, or a mother and a daughter. If the son or daughter are teens, that could be really, really, ugly. Not only would someone in law enforcement be accusing an older person of being a paedophile, they would be accusing them of being a gay paedophile,and intern they would also be labelling a younger person 'gay and into older people of the same sex'. The invention of the atomic bomb has nothing on what that could do. Personally, I think the female motorcycle cop in Silent Hill crossed the line, and for her dumbness she ended up being a human torch, later on in the film. Lots of thrills and chills and a good ending that I will not give away. Maybe a bit graphic here and there. More than anything, I think the film portrays how our 'good society' is sometimes like being trapped on The Bounty, with Captain Bligh spouting venal clap trap and calling it brainy.",Null,0,0,22 June 2010
Crash," Interesting to see scenes of life through the eyes of LA
","I thought it was a film intended to move towards a big climax which it did, so in that way it was a good allegory for the human experience in the modern world-people are always racing towards something or away from something-but nobody is stationary for very long, and things are always peaking and then falling back again. I liked the characters even though I didn't always agree with them. There is a contradiction in the celebration of the human experience in todays cinema in that we embrace the complexities and new experiences of the modern world but at the same time the happenstance of the modern melange can create very real and sometimes stomach turning problems. I think LA is probably unique in that is is such a car culture contrasted against other cities in North America. Car culture is much like 'cargo culture' where life imitates the life before it, not always representing the meanings of what was, so clearly. In the film people search for meaning in a world that threatens to crush them out of existence in the blink of an eye. Is it the pursuit of order in chaos that drives us on?, is a question asked by the film. Mostly we are just swept from place to situation by events we can no longer control, is what I think the answer is.It's nice to think we are in control of things, but things mostly just control us. Good work, maybe tries to deal with too many situations at once.",Null,1,6,1 September 2009
Alien," an unfinished idea
","I think this is a classic SF flick but that doesn't mean there wasn't room to explore more of what the alien was, as opposed to seeing it rip humans in half type of thing. I think the film is a bit too gory. By further exploration of the alien entity, I mean that nowhere in the film does anyone suggest that what they are seeing is an alien human hybrid. The fact that the alien is found on a derelict vessel, piloted by another type of alien begs the question that if a species had such advanced technology the chances of it being retrieved would be fairly high, so it probably would not even be there, unless the whole thing was a deliberate set up. The idea of the find being a deliberate set up are also never explored by the film maker. We now have many extra solar planets listed in technical books on space. Many of these planets exist in what is called habitation belts. The idea of suggesting where the apparently violent alien hybrid came from is not explored nor is the possible home planet of the alien vessel explored. The idea of extra solar planets is not new. Also the fact the alien that became a alien human hybrid did so after being in a gestation phase for perhaps as long as a million years. That suggest profound cell damages in any extant organism. That idea was not explored. Lots of tension, but I would call it surface tension, as the real deal is the real deal of thinking about what it all means. Well, that is just my opinion. It is an effective film, but perhaps it claims to be thinking mans SF, which it isn't.",Null,2,5,22 August 2009
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," part of a fairly dismal extended saga
","I always think that the Star Wars films are like a cinematic version of the early magazine from France called Metal Hurlante which the 1970s US magazine Heavy Metal was based on. All of the images in the Star Wars films feel like I have seen them somewhere before-and I probably have-that notwithstanding-I think the films are too much about war-it is really not that interesting-like the boundaries of space have been completely explored and there is nothing left to learn or do except have giant wars-that is a dismal vision of the future to me-the concept of alien civilizations is dealt with in a basic way that tells nothing about what makes them different to humans or why they spend any time at all in human space-none of the aliens who do look like they have anything in common with humans anyway-I think that should have been explored in my opinion. So maybe it is nothing but cheap rip off SF-made to look clean and cool with advanced CGI effects and nothing really going on in the way of IQ activity. Oh well, the kiddies will like it. I also think that Metal Hurlante was not aimed at kids.",Null,1,2,26 December 2009
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Funny film about something maybe not so great...and real
","I thought this was a funny film...but the stuff about remote viewing is real...and bizarro...the work of two psychologists, Targ and Putoff, who seemed to have gone off the deep end back there in the early 70s with ESP experiments that somehow convinced them they could see things through ESP from a great distance away with no knowledge of the target area. Freaky. Freakier is that 20 million bucks were pored into it. Dreams of weapons mass destruction? Maybe, and that is disturbin' to me. Jeff bridges was in this movie and he, as usual, made it better as a result. George Clooney was also very good in this movie-I think he is under-rated as a comedy actor myself. There is a great scene near the end of what happens when someone puts a whole lotta hallucinogenic drugs in a military outposts Army rations.Don't want to spoil the film.

Ocean's Eleven," Kind of an abysmal film on a number of key levels.
","I thought it was really quite good up until actress Julia Roberst plays a character playing Julia Roberts. It went from an eight to a four in five minutes. Other than that it is a good film...well, maybe it loses the right to be called a good film with such a loopy plot twist. La dee da what else to say..Amsterdam is an attractive city, and so is Rome...Not much else you can say about this film...except one of the actors in it was born today..I suppose the plot twist underlies the fact that there really was no possibility of making a working version of a sequel to the first movie. I wonder if the 3D tech that appears in the film really exists...Oh well, thats all I have to say. Good luck to the producers filling cinemas with stuff like this. They say that cinema is based on the audience willing to suspend their disbelief of things that are maybe impossible. Maybe that point is taken too far by some film folk.",Null,1,3,20 March 2010
District 9," best SF I have ever seen
","I was really surprised by this film. I was expecting something much less but I think this has got to be the best SF film I have ever seen. Excellent makeup work and 'mis en scene' makes this a very believable movie. Just too bad the cinema I saw it in had kind of tattered seats and kind of smelled of sweat, and a fly kept flying in front of the screen in front of me, just beyond my reach. The movie was not overly short or overly long, and the acting was perfect for what it was about. I recommend this film highly to fans of SF, the summers best one, bar none. It is interesting to see the progression in terms of SF film making from when the film Alien came out in 1979, to the Hollywood blitz of Arnie does SF films in the 1990s, to the land of endless rehashes of the concept of monster aliens that is supposedly a nod to Alien post 2000, but is really a nod to nothing. This film adds to the work that will be called classic SF in years to come. Up with it!",Null,3,6,20 August 2009
2012," A thrill ride for sure
","Newsflash-the Earths core is already molten-well, other than that, the film works OK...in fact the visual effects surpass any other film I have ever seen in terms of sheer scope and immensity-it is truly something incredible to see-perhaps even mind blowing. The plot is well constructed and the acting is excellent so that definitely helps along the end of the world scenario put forth in this here flick. Funny that despite the fact this was a significant movie event for most film goers there were still people in the audience huffing and hawing through the film, texting as much as eight times in succession creating annoying bright lights coming from somewhere in front type of thing-which surprised me a bit. Also funny-I think-was the way NASA goes on CNN saying that the movie is not based on real science re its 2012 date for the end if things, when the Mayan calendar does in fact end at 2012...I think that NASA recently also saying that they feel there is water on the moon does not help their credibility all that much-well, I know I think that the moon is waterless, despite NASA saying the contrary. There is nothing like silly science to make a day complete. I was impressed by this film but I don't believe that the Mayans were more knowledgeable about the Erarth than modern man in general. I seriously doubt if anyone believes that Earth will cease to be in 2012-the film is just good fun, and worth a look, to me.",Null,1,5,15 November 2009
The Hurt Locker," Excellent war film
","I thought this was a very realistic film, and well acted also, about the cauldron of urban fighting in Iraq. Informs as well as takes you on a journey through a war torn place that will probably always bear the scars of conflict, no matter how many years pass. I really got a sense that the people who made this film had researched their subject matter thoroughly, in an effort to present the best possible vision of what things are really like in modern day Iraq re the war there. Worth the time to see even if you are not especially drawn to war films. I did not get a sense of dominating egos on the screen-it was well balanced and was not just another film made to promote this or that star. Interestingly, because it was a war film, it was not particularly gory, although it could have been-sure there was a moment or two, but it was clean stuff compared to much prime time TV viewing.",Null,5,10,16 September 2009
Paranormal Activity," better than cheese and old running shoes in a soup
","Since it is genuine footage it is definitely interesting. You would think that. If you were six. I liked the scene where a screaming tattered old person with popped out eyeballs sits up in bed looking at the female lead just as she wakes up and sits up in the middle of the night and scares the character so badly their hair stands strait up and fire shoots out of the characters ears. No, wait, that was a dream I had last night, not this film. Oh well, this film was OK, but I coulda thought of more frightening scenes-like maybe an arm stretching and reaching across the room 20 feet in the dark half light-reaching for a smoke or something while the couple sits in bed freaking out like they had 999,000 volts running through them nonstop.

2001: A Space Odyssey," This film brought to you courtesy of Arthur Clarke
","I think that because Stanley Kubrick directed this film people think that he wrote the SF story called The Sentinel, which led to a book, which led to this film. The Sentinal short SF story and the subsequent SF book 2001 A Space Odyssey was written of course by British SF pioneer Sir Arthur Clarke. The writer, Arthur Clarke was asked by his publisher to expand on his short story called The Sentinal which led to the creation of the book 2001 A Space Odyssey, which led to interest in creating a film version of the book. Sadly, both writer and director are now dead. This film did not age very well, I think. Never mind that the entire conceptualization has mankind making a trip to Jupiter in 2001 and in real life we are not even close to making such an expedition. That is a bit of a thing. Anyway, I think that without the original SF by Arthur Clarke this film would not even exist on paper. Maybe I am underscoring the efforts of the film maker, but since the entire story is the result of Arthur Clarke, I question the superiority of the director position in this project. The director is doing a job here, not the writer is doing a job for the director. The now famous 'psychedelic journey' in this film represents the futurism of Arthur Clarke, but it also associates the film with some kind of drug induced hallucination, which is not what the writer intended. The film is supposed to talk about how man comes into contact with a superior alien race. What that means is anybodies guess. The writer says it is the birth of man in a state of cosmic awareness in a new form. I think that is maybe a bit ambiguous.It is OK to question great works of SF, and Arthur Clarke was one of the best SF writers that ever lived.(by the way anybody can slip in zero G-its your muscle co-ordination thats the issue-not you falling down-and the character in question in the film has Velcro on the souls of her shoes which sticks to other fabric surfaces)",Null,0,4,22 August 2009
Avatar," Good with some reservations about modus operandi
","I think most SF fans will give this film a 10 out of 10. It is an amazing film...but in a way it is also a disappointing one. I say disappointing because the budget was huge and the amount of time spent on it was also huge...so with guidelines like that making a bomber would be probably impossible. I think it is also disappointing because it relies almost exclusively on special effects to make its story or plot function. I think special effects should be not the thing a movie revolves around, they should compliment the story-not be the story itself. The film leaves a powerful emotional charge in its wake which is an indication that the director was trying very hard to create something interesting-but as someone who is familiar with SF and artists in general, I can say that the filmmaker has borrowed heavily from the artwork of Yes album cover artist Roger Dean for inspiration in this films striking visuals, as well as the written works of Anne McCafferty, who wrote the Dragonsinger series of SF-Fantasy books. It is a great film, but how could it not be when a filmmaker can have such a huge budget-no time limit, and a world of amazing creative people to draw ideas from. The hard SF tech in this film looks like it fell out of both a Terminator film and an Alien sequel...go get 'em James Cameron.",Null,2,9,18 December 2009
Zombieland," goes from funny to dumb in a flash
","I saw this film on a truly huge screen with a bunch of people who were, like me at the time, right into seeing a no holds barred zombie film. I can remember thinking at the end , it was like poetry, but not quite. I saw it again and I realized that Woody Harrelsons character was talking about a puppy named Buck at one point and then a boy named Buck later on in the film. I can overlook that what was supposed to be Bill Murrays place in Beverly Hills probably really belonged to Bette Midler, but I think the mixing up who or what Buck was supposed to be was just downright dumb. Maybe the people who make these movies just think people are dumb. Maybe it is some kind of calculated insult.

What might have been an inspired rendering of the life of an interesting man became a quasi X-Files episode that stopped abruptly and left the audience dangling, then the film is deflty dropped into the cold hands of a contrite and abominable psychiatrist. I bought a copy on DVD for a friend and was disappointed that it was so blighted a production. I would not recommend this film to anyone. Something cannot be called a delusion if it is shooting at you from a moving vehicle. Oh that was just a dramatic device to illustrate psychosis. Right.

Sherlock Holmes," Cast in reverse for some reason
","This film was, in my opinion, a perfect example of casting gone bad...Jude Law would have made an excellent Sherlock Holmes and Robert Downie Jr. would have made an excellent Dr. Watson...alas, they did it backwards, and the results are a funny Sherlock and a serious Dr. Watson. In short, it is quite the bastardization of the original concept, which is an excellent and timeless work of creative fiction. Also, and this should come as no surprise, the action sequences (action sequences in Sherlock Holmes?) were out of step with the original work, and came off as kind of tasteless in the true sense of the word-as in like eating cardboard. Maybe a fun bang for your buck if you are stuck at a shopping mall one afternoon and you have decided to depart the shopping experience for a film escape-it is that, but it just isn't up to snuff as far as film adaptations go. The historic time period visuals are left behind in the wake of casting the film the wrong way round, as is much of Sherlock Holmes dialogue, which is also frequently muffed by actor Robert Downie Jr.",Null,2,6,5 January 2010
The Blind Side," A more dismal reasoning is behind this film.
","This might seem to be just a movie that aims to be heart warming and make you feel good about life, but there is achingly more behind the victorious conclusion of this movie and little of it is heart warming. Since the days when men were judged to be good or of little use based on their size, there has been an undercurrent of thinking that sees bigger males as better males, i.e. 5-7 is dumb and 6-5 is smart. It probably comes from when there was little medicine in the past and bigger people were considered better breeding material. If modern Universities promote dumb guys as normal guys when they are really not, we are back in the stone age again. It is already happening, and many Universities are nothing more than conduits for athletes to go pro after graduation and academia counts for little. Some Universities will engage in little smear campaigns against students who are not into things like football and who see through this stuff, down to the hard core it is. Hooray for Sandra Bullock, she has a big heart and no clue about Universities, in that are often very bad paces to be in if you have any brains and don't stand eight feet tall and weigh a thousand pounds. I liked that the young black dude in this film got his life together. Great for him. Given that he could barely read, I think its wonderful that several Universities wanted him so badly. I think maybe Sandra Bullock is not aware of what damage promoting large not bright guys as University material has done to Universities. Football doesn't last forever. This policy in effect sends these guys on a collision course with humanity when they stop playing ball. Great stuff. I never met a large guy with much in the way of brains. And I think there is nothing worse than trying to turn back the clock on more brainy students at University by playing games with them as if it was grade three and Tommy can't throw a football right.

Scream," Not bad, in a way, yet...
","I liked the take on horror films that drives this particular film series. A bit bloody at times but that is all part of why it works as a horror film. I see many of the other reviews for films and other people seem to write so much more than I do about any given film. I think there is something to say about movies but not a lot, in terms of films in general. Watching a horror film alone is a recipe for freaking yourself out, as if the world doesn't throw enough crap at you in general. Many newer horror films, including this one, all have something in common, they are all aimed at young audiences. That is to say the 16 to 18 crowd. I suppose it works from a monetary standpoint-younger people will spend on horror films more than people over 30, nonetheless, it relegates the horror genre into being Collegiate fair only, which I think narrows the field down considerably as to the subject matter dealt with in modern horror films. Films like The Hills Have Eyes are remakes of 1970's horror, which I think isn't really going forwards. Films like Rosemary's Baby are not made anymore, surprising given the crazy pits that many apartment buildings in big cities have become over the years. Go team go is an interesting rallying cry for the horror genre. Kind of a bit tedious perhaps. This is a not bad film, but I think that because I don't mind films that have a cast mostly all under 25. On the other hand, there is really nothing else out there to watch. Hobson's Choice is no choice at all. Same goes for the I Know What You Did Last Summer movies.",Null,0,1,19 June 2010
Blade Runner," over rated but still fun to look at
","The artwork by futurist and designer Syd Mead is this movie. Many of the drawings that were used to create the sets in this film are available on the web and I think they are worth looking at as Syd Mead has got good talent when it comes to creating interesting looking futuristic panoramas. I thought the script of the film was middling to very weak, and the end sequences were not very enjoyable to watch, taking the film down a kind of black hole, compared to the interesting scenes in the beginning and in the middle of the film. I was surprised to see multiple versions released a few years ago in a sort of pricey box set, as the versions differ only slightly. I did some research and learnt that Sir Run Run Shaw, credited in the film, is a Chinese media mogul, who must have been around 90 when the film Blade Runner was made. I have read a not bad sequel, but there seems to be no interest in creating a movie sequel based on the book sequel, which I think is kind of sad, because despite the often dim witted script, the film had interesting visuals. People who think this is the best thing ever made visually should explore more SF art, particularly the work of Jim Burns. With a better script this would be an easy ten, but as it stands it sounds like fifth rate detective fiction from the 1940s, so I gave it a seven, not a four.",Null,1,2,22 August 2009

","Loosely based on the 1973 SF book by British SF writer Edmund Cooper called The Cloud Walker, Star Wars stands out as the movie with the most appropriations from SF novels in the history of film. It's not that it's a bad movie, quite the contrary, it is a great film, and it should be, the film maker borrowed ideas from about 50 different SF writers. Anyway, there is some very good visual work based on some very good conceptual SF artwork. Personally, I never liked the sound the Wookie kept making in the film-I think since it was done about 50 times, and I didn't care much for CV3PO and I thought R2D2 needed some work to be more than just a talking garbage can, just like Hewy and Dewy from Bruce Dern's SF film Silent Running made in the early 1970s-yet another appropriation, that time from an earlier American SF film no less. If I was George Lucas I would feel a very embarrassed to have used so much of other peoples work to complete a 'masterpiece.'Not recognized to have spawned mediocre television SF show Battlestar Galactica in 1978-despite the repetition of key word 'Battlestar'. I guess one rip off deserved another. I gave it a seven because I liked it when I saw it as a young person, but in truth it probably deserves only a one for its high number of appropriations, and its coy character names that are really nothing more than cheap sex jokes.",Null,0,0,22 August 2009
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Sort of pretentious
","It was predictable that they would make this movie, but it probably will not go down in horror film history as anything special because it is a fairly run of the mill horror film. It was watchable but not all that interesting to me. I think I have a good open mind for new film experiences but I think this saga is sort of pretentious. Like a copy of the Underworld saga but more easy on the eyes, it doesn't really add anything interesting to the genre of werewolf films or the genre of vampire films. Kind of a ho hum movie to me, oh well, there are other things to watch. One of the problems that I can see with this series is that they have to many young characters in an area that would not be so dominated by young people-as in the area of the occult. There would be visibly older people as much as there would be visibly younger people. Maybe it is like saying 'we were left out by you and now we are leaving you out' type of thing, in terms of the film being a reaction against so little acting work often being given to younger actors in general for serious parts. Maybe. It is sort of like a Peanuts cartoon where adults are portrayed as fuzzy indistinct nuisances.",Null,15,26,11 July 2010
Hustle & Flow," kind of a surprise
","As a person who listens to all kinds of music I was interested in this film. I was surprised by it. Perhaps I shouldn't have expected it to be anything special. Rap lines like 'it's hard out here for a pimp' don't quality as anything in my book. To me that sounds the same as 'it's hard to be stupid.' I like Run DMC and a few others, who I feel have some artistic credibility, but I think this movie does significant damage to the idea of rap as notable street poetry. I feel this film makes rapers look like they all have their heads on backwards, which I think is not always the case. Coming nowhere near the stinging social commentary of an Ice-T, this film is sly reductionism rather than entertainment or enlightenment. In a world that turns out hundreds of films a year it really should not surprise me that something like this came along. Given enough time just about every point of view gets represented,unfortunately.",Null,0,2,15 August 2009
Law Abiding Citizen," A Challenging Film on many levels
","An excellent and complex film that manages to explore the idea that justice can be a double edged sword. A rarity in that sense also, since it presents but doesn't judge, allowing the audience to make their own conclusions rather than championing one side or the other. Clever. Subtle yet action orientated. It got to the point that I was not sure who I was really rooting for myself, after seeing the mincing that was going on behind closed doors regarding what to do and who to do it to and if they could get away with it all. Fascinating take on the modern justice system quite unlike the black and white renderings of same that appear on television on half a dozen syndicated crime shows. I could see it again.",Null,2,5,20 October 2009
Up in the Air," A weird movie to me
","I have never heard of any companies hiring out freelance firers to fire people before-not to say that it doesn't exist somewhere, but I have never heard of it...so this is a weird film to me on a number of levels. George Cloony will have no doubt an audience here because of his track record in previous films, but that is not to say it is a stellar performance, in fact I think it is perhaps far from being stellar, as the last line in the film is perhaps one of the most empty sentiments I have ever heard anyone utter, but I will not say what that was as it might reveal to much of the film. There is an interlude with a supposedly female version of himself in the film all full of cool dialogue to show just how cool they are to each other. The connection is ultimately not real, and in retrospect that is a very unsatisfying moment in the movie. Everybody wants to be cool, or at least be around cool. No cool here. Oh modern life is such an alienating experience with its glass and steel worlds and its access cards and impersonal computers. Most people experience that each day so this film drawing attention to the obvious is perhaps a waste of time also.Is the point that relationships suck? Some do, some don't. So what? Well, I guess it is sort of a so what for this movie from me.",Null,0,4,21 January 2010
