The Longest Yard," I liked it
","I enjoyed this movie. I will admit that I have not seen the original and have heard that this new version was different in many ways, I still enjoyed it. It seemed to be more geared toward a teen-aged audience than an older or family audience. I also thought that Adam Sandler was the perfect man for the lead role. I also think that people need to go into this movie with an open mind. If you go into this movie expecting it to be just like the original, you will be sadly disappointed. It is like the old movie with a modern twist. If you go into this movie with a closed mind, you will not like it. But if you go into this movie with an open mind, you may be surprised.",8,1,3,12 June 2005
