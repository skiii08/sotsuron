Skyfall," Brilliant tribute to Commander Bond for 50 years of service
","I'm a big fan of Bond series but I didn't like Craig's version. I thought that was ridiculous that producers turned Bond into some kind of bodybuilder and topless Daniel Craig appears on the screen more times than topless hot Bond girls but honestly... SKYFALL is apparently the best Bond in last 30 years! A brilliant tribute on 50 anniversary of the series. Storyline is very interesting and allows to show that Bond is getting old, reveals his secrets from the past and focusing on his relations with M (sometimes I thought that SKYFALL is more about M than Bond). I think an idea of mother-son relationship between them was great. Some people in reviews already mentioned about references to the old episodes so I can only add that music score and Adele's song are superb and last but not least... Javier Bardem! Oh men he's one of the best Bond's opponents ever! He's role can be easily placed next to Hugh Ledger's from Dark Knight. I liked the ending a lot, final showdown got the style of movies from 70's. Sam Mendes once again showed that he's the one of the best directors in nowadays so go to the cinema and pay the tribute to Commander Bond for 50 years of service.Cheers",9,2,15,29 October 2012
