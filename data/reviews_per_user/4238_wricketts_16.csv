Changeling," Vastly Overrated & Flabby
","Very interesting story, but one goes away wondering what all the fuss was about. Angelina Jolie is normally hard to watch for any extended period of time (and here you have to watch her for 2.5 hours); there's a way in which she can never seem to wipe a certain smirk or sneer or leer out of her facial expression, which renders her acting always slightly false. Meanwhile, her decidedly 21st-century botoxed lips don't help much with her depiction of a woman in the 1930s. Jeffrey Donavan, in fact is about the only one who looks like he belongs there; most of the rest, including John Malkovich, seem slightly embarrassed by their clothes and their hairdos. In general, the film is marred by a lot of hammy overacting (the children overall but especially Jason Butler Harner, who becomes nearly unwatchable). Indeed, Eastwood seems to lose control of his actors or, alternatively, to be letting them flounder around without a rope -- but Michael Kelly is memorable in a fairly small role.",5,7,16,24 November 2008
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Get this man a psychiatrist
","Every year, a near infinity of bad movies is churned out by people who think they're artists or who can raise a lot of money or (what is so much worse) both; so it would hardly be sufficient to pan this rancid piece of putrescent offal on the simple basis that it is bad  although it is agonizingly, oppressively, relentlessly bad. What lands this movie, instead, smack dab in the category of the justifiably censurable and eminently burnable is that Sacha Baron Cohen deploys his so-called humor to express what I can only imagine is a virtually bottomless wellspring of hatred and hostilitytoward himself, but especially toward anyone unlucky enough to share the planet with him. More than that, he's the kind of 'comedian' who considers himself exempt from all the normal rules of human decency simply because he's a comedian; he can 'say anything,' because his 'art' liberates him (or so he would no doubt tell you). He'd tell you that because he's too neurotically immature to admit the truth: He chose comedy so he could 'say anything' without paying the consequences that the rest of us must. His 'humor' masks a form of psychological illness and shouldn't be mistaken for a profession. It is a truism, in fact (though it also happens to be true), that one of humor's main engines is hostility, and Cohen is a classic perpetrator. For Cohen, 'just kidding' is all the excuse he would need after he'd run your pet dog over with the lawn mower or dropped your infant child over the balcony. (And what a giggle, that look on your face!) For him, the excuse of 'humor' excuses, well, everything. It's precisely the kind of shield that bullieseven skinny, unattractive bullieshave used since speech was invented to lacerate others. If you object, if you take offense, then you just 'don't get it,' you're a bore, you're a poor sport. When, in point of fact, you are none of those things. When what you are, instead, is someone who can perceive when another person is calling you an idiot (and not even with great subtlety). The antics that Cohen got up to in making this filmand of which, thus, the film itself is the documentary evidenceare one example after another of his loathing and malice toward all. He finds stupid people and makes them say stupid things; this is 'funny.' He finds sincere, honest people and he treats them so abominably that they lose their cool; this is 'funny.' He finds warm-hearted, helpful people and he embarrasses them horribly; this is 'funny.' He creates unnatural situations in which people can only react unnaturally; this is 'funny.' Cohen's rationalebecause tyrants always have a rationaleis that he's 'exposing' hypocrisy or letting us see the 'underbelly' of society. No, he's actually not. What he's actually doing is fully and happily participating in that underbelly; he's perpetuating hypocrisy (using the fictional character of Borat, Cohen literally lies to get people to talk to him). He's inviting you to give him money to see him say 'FU' to people who don't deserve it (and a few who perhaps do), and then he says 'FU' to you for being stupid enough to want to watch. He is, in short, a jerk. An angry, hostile, misanthropic, nasty-minded, obnoxious jerk. _Borat_ is for people who don't have the guts to launch their own insults. It's symptomatic of an international 'I'm OK; you're a worthless piece of s***' malaise--the malaise that Cohen would like you to believe he's exposing but which, instead, he's working as hard as he can to foster.",1,11,21,26 July 2007
Lone Survivor," Propaganda, 2013 Style
","Good God, this was a terrible movie, and I can't quite understand how people like Mark Wahlberg and Peter Berg let themselves get caught up in such a piece of propagandistic hogwash. Marcus Luttrelle is hardly an uncomplicated figure—his numerous right-wing comments in interviews since his book came out, for instance, make clear the extent to which he's the typical brainwashed 'Murrican soldier—and there's absolutely nothing here to raise this film above the thoughtless, hoo-rah level of a period John Wayne flick (with much more fake blood). Numerous slow periods are punctuated by gruesome violence. Is this supposed to teach us something? Like 'war is hell' or some other profound thought? Only a person with a heart of stone could fail to burst into laughter at the scene in which Marcus—near death and barely able to walk—stops to embrace a small Afghani child before climbing onto the helicopter that is going to carry him to safety (where he immediately codes and has to be shocked back to life). That level of flagrant, unsubtle pandering is exactly what makes this film a waste of everyone's time. This is a film for people who have drunk the Kool-Aid; if you retain the capacity for critical thought, you'll find it a bloody bore.",3,3,5,24 October 2014
Hostel," Afterwards, you'll need to wash
","It's really hard to review this film without using bad words, which I know IMDb wouldn't allow. So I'll try to keep things civil. This is a sick, sick film. And NOT in the good way. Not in the 'Tarantino is so cool because of the way he looks at violence' kind of way. Just in the perverted, amoral, sick-MINDED, 'somebody seriously needs to get some therapy' kind of way. Yeah, THAT kind of sick. The kind of sick film that you can't have any fun watching because you can tell the person who made it is truly as depraved as he seems. The kind of 'horror' film that offers no horror other than what is BEHIND the scenes: the horror of Eli Roth's mind, the filth and sleaze that lies within it. The kind of film where physical violence is conceptualized as a kind of pornography and where you're supposed to get your 'I Heart Torture' jollies watching it. Think snuff films. Think those 'Real Death' videos that you see in the bin at the Slurp-n-Snort on the interstate. That's the level that Roth/Tarantino were stopping to here, and, though someone will certainly argue that Roth is so 'cool' because he draws your attention to social phenomena blah blah blah mental masturbation and it's a reflection of intellectual spew which shows us how we artist wannabe claptrap.... No, it's petty, it's disgusting, it's vile, it's corrupt, it's debauched -- and Eli Roth wants you to think it's art.",1,1,4,2 June 2007
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Not even enough escapist fun to justify the price of the ticket
","Perfectly banal and overwrought, with CGI and other special effects that move at the speed of light and make a crap load of noise, but are completely incomprehensible in terms of understanding who is doing what to whom or why any of it matters. Jake Gyllenhaal is hunky and pretty in Arab drag, but he and all the other actors are basically just collecting their paychecks; apparently no one told Ben Kingsley that it was all essentially a big joke, because he occasionally tries to transmit an actual emotion, which makes him look ridiculous (even more than all the mascara he was wearing) in the context of the others who are literally cartoons. Richard Coyle is arguably the worst, but the inevitable 'princess who must be saved and screwed (Gemma Arterton) is an utter, irremediable dog and my eyes bled every time she appeared on screen.",2,12,26,29 May 2010
Knowing," You'd save yourself $10 if you just let your Sunday School teacher explain the Rapture to you....
","Right up until about the last 20 minutes, this film was barely acceptable as a ham-handed, badly acted, B-level thriller. At that point, however, it switched gears and revealed itself as a smarmy little allegory straight out of Revelations. It's the Rapture, stupid. In short: the earth is about to be destroyed by fire, the whole thing was predicted by the prophet Ezekiel, only those who are 'chosen' and who 'hear the voices of the angels' can be saved, and all the good children are carried off by aliens to serve as miniature Adams and Eves (along w/assorted animals) and repopulate another planet. What garbage. (Who wrote this nonsense? Tim LaHaye?) It's not even worth the time to get started on the long list of logical blunders and continuity errors in this film, though the scene at the 'end of the world' when Cage manages to drive calmly through the streets of Manhattan while hundreds of thousands of people are looting and screaming and running around in sheer panic – well, it's just priceless, is what it is. (Personal to Nicholas Cage's handlers: Cut the man's hair or buy him a better wig! His plugs are showing and have been since long before National Treasure.)",2,0,2,14 October 2009
The Men Who Stare at Goats," The joke's on you
","The biggest insult of this film is that Grant Heslov and Peter Straughan (both of whom deserve to be spanked), along with their sad, uninspired clot of actors, apparently expect you to take this hogwash seriously. Apparently they believed that audiences, like the goats of the title, would be unable to resist the mind-control of a manic nutcase with a scorching case of megalomania. If you leave the theater being able to answer the question, 'What was the point of this movie?' please write and tell me. Better yet, write and tell the director, because he's even more clueless than I am. The actors in this nonsense are literally all over the place, flailing around without the slightest idea whether they're appearing in a comedy, a farce, or a drama (and if what George Clooney is doing in this film is 'acting,' I ought to be earning a cool 20 mil every time I walk out of the house, too). More than a few of the scenes have all the hallmarks of 'improvised' moments in which nobody knew in what direction to take the film, so they decided to throw in an explosion or a fight or a flashback. What it is, is unadulterated dreck, a colossal flop that ought never to have been released. 'The events in this film are truer than you could possibly imagine' says the legend that follows the opening credits. I'd have put it another way: 'This film is the product of a night of serious drug-abuse, only we forgot that what seems genius when you're high is incompressible drivel when you wake up the next day. Too late though: You've already paid us.'",1,9,26,9 November 2009
District 9," Just in case you were convinced it was impossible to make a silly film about apartheid
","I can't imagine what kind of viewer would find this film deep or metaphorical or anything other than a grand, slow-moving, grimly adolescent bore, but there are apparently many who have considered it a great work of art on themes of racism, immigration, and apartheid. It isn't. It's a smarmy, unnecessarily gory (and I have no objections whatever to gore), low-rent (in feel, if not actually in budget) scifi flick along the lines of Alien Nation (but about 50 times less adroit) that is so insecure of itself that it reminds you (constantly, nervously) who the bad guys are and who the good guys are and whacks you over the head every other scene with its deep and righteous sense of morality. If this is the best Metaphor for Xenophobia they could come up with, I am so scared. What no one seems to notice is a) that the aliens for whom we're supposed to be all filled with sympathy are actually pretty gross; the 'good' alien (Christopher Johnson; a single father, to boot) who forms an uneasy alliance with Wikus van de Merwe doesn't even begin to make up for all the scenes of aliens doing things that are downright creepy and for which the film provides zero cultural context that might allow us to understand them in a different light; and b) that the actual blacks in the film are animals, almost literally. In other words, the great anti-racist 'message' gets a little lost. Add to that the fact that Sharlto Copley (as van de Merwe) plays his scenes as if he were Sacha Baron Cohen and you get yet one more silly, superficial movie about racism that can't stop congratulating itself for how hip and meaningful it is.",3,6,13,21 October 2009
Hotel Transylvania," A Waste of Animators
","Hotel Transylvania has occasionally cute moments and intermittently interesting art design (otherwise, it's mostly K-Mart Hallowe'en décor), but the story is trite, hackneyed, cliché, and any other words you can think of that mean: nobody broke a sweat on the script or on the plot. The voices are mostly uninteresting, except for Steve Buscemi, who attracts interest by demonstrating that he was catastrophically miscast as the Werewolf. The film is also aimed at a very, very young age group, something you might not understand from seeing the trailer, which makes the film seem about 10 times more sophisticated than it actually is. If you've got little kids, take 'em. If you don't, you'll fall asleep about halfway through the opening credits. If you do go, DO NOT spring the extra bucks for the 3D version. There's about as much 3D here as there is on your average Etch-A-Sketch.",3,15,35,7 October 2012
The Da Vinci Code," The Catholic Church should be more worried that we'll die of boredom....
","I was hoping for a hundred and fifty minutes of a wild ride, and this movie was, instead, a huge freakin' bore.**SPOILERS FOLLOW!!!** Tom Hanks is asleep for a good 2/3rds of the movie, and that poor French girl (Audrey Tatou) has a repertoire of facial expressions that run the gamut from mild surprise to slightly less mild surprise.Sample dialogue: 'Hey, Audrey. You're not really named Sonnier, the guy that raised you isn't really your grandfather, you're the pawn of a fanatical religious cult, and to top it off, you're the direct descendant of Jesus Christ.' Audrey: 'Oh, wow.' Jean Reno needs to retire - or else to get an Oscar for having played exactly the same character for an entire career in at least 271 films; and Akiva Goldsman, who word-processed the sleeping-pill of a screenplay, ought to be murdered with a flagellum. I don't say it to be mean. I say it because someone has to be sacrificed in order to save the world from future screenplays like 'I, Robot,' 'Lost in Space,' and 'Batman and Robin.' Now that we can't accuse Dan Brown of plagiarism anymore, I say we get together and file a class-action lawsuit against Ron Howard for party-pooping instead.",2,3,7,22 May 2006
The Departed," Another 'Sympathy' Oscar
","I'm never going to be in a position to win an Oscar, so maybe I just don't understand how goshdarn fab it is to get one. Still, were I Martin Scorsese, I can't imagine not being too ashamed to show my face in public after receiving an Oscar for this claptrap. This isn't a Martin Scorsese film; this is a Saturday Night Live sendup of a Martin Scorsese film. This is the Academy saying, 'Well, we didn't give him one for Gangs of New York or for Good Fellas, and he's getting a little long in the tooth, after all. We'd better give him an Oscar for this before he croaks.' Is there anyone -- ANYONE??? -- in this film, with the possible exception of DiCaprio, who isn't acting following a major dose of Xanax? (Matt Damon evidently took his Xanax after a lobotomy that was so botched that he could no longer even change his facial expression.) And what's with Mark Wahlberg's HAIR??? Is there any redeeming social value in scene after scene (after scene) of heads exploding in a red cloud? Even Scorsese is bored with depicting violence; he does it because it's expected of him, not because he really gives a damn anymore. You're stupid enough to want it; he's jaded enough to give it to you. A plot line with more holes in it than the hull of The Titanic. Characters about as appealing as Jeffrey Dahmer. You can't care what happens to a single person in this film, and you can't even care that the moral center collapses about an hour in. This film isn't even sickening; it's just dull, dull-witted, and trashy. Scorsese got his Oscar out of sympathy; too bad the film doesn't have any for the viewer.",1,45,77,25 April 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," Intriguing but coopted by H'wood romanticism
","For me, the big surprise of this film was that Will Ferrell was actually watchable, exhibiting very little of the 'Ick' factor that he usually exudes as one of the most unattractive and pathetically unfunny performers in cinema and television. I'd be delighted if his role in this film convinced him that comedy has been a big, big error in his life. Emma Thompson was fantastic; Hoffman more or less lent the film one of his second-hand performances that he wasn't using anymore and was just cluttering up one of the closets at home. The premise is extremely intriguing, but didn't end up in the most intellectually stimulating place, devolving instead, in the film's last 15 minutes, into a sort of sappy, predictable Hollywood romance. ***SPOILERS FOLLOW*** There's a sort of logical hole in the premise (if Karen Eiffel 'knows' everything, because she's writing it, she knows that Crick is going to phone and visit her, she knows that Prof. Hilbert knows who she is because she's 'written' the scenes in which Crick talks to Hilbert, etc.), but the interesting part of the plot SHOULD have been  and here is where the comment on the way literature 'enters' into our lives and we 'enter' into literature could have been truly incisive  is two-fold: (a) not everything in Crick's life, obviously, is 'controlled' by Eiffel, which only makes sense, otherwise 'reality' becomes a hall of mirrors (Eiffel is writing Eiffel writing Crick); and (b) the difference between fictional characters and 'real' life is that characters in novels and stories can never do anything differently but 'real' people can. The film kind of mudges over this philosophical point in order to 'save' Crick.",6,1,2,10 March 2008
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Haven't you already seen this film about 20 times?
","What a strange thing: Allen makes the exact same film he's been making for what seems like a century, but shifts the set from New York to Barcelona. It isn't clear why, other than to include scenes of Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem fighting in Spanish. Allen's habitual, relentless claustrophia remains as present as ever, though, and we barely ever get out of a house, a room, a tight shot on a stilted conversation. Barcelona could have been Baltimore for all the difference it made. Neurotic artists, bad relationships, gossip, nouveau riche, petit bourgeoisie, passive men, crazy women, blah blah blah blah. Plus ça change, plus c'est le même Allen.",3,6,12,24 November 2009
Flight," Never really takes 'Flight'
","A watchable but decidedly not a great film. Washington is his usual opaque self here, and his struggle to convey actual emotion is at times more difficult to watch than are the tough feelings he's supposed to be expressing. For years I've had the sense that there was something slightly cold and detached inside Washington as an actor. It's a style that serves him very well in hard-ass, semi-sociopath roles such as in Training Day, but makes him hard to believe when he plays characters with real emotional depth and whose inner turmoil ought to make us weep. All in all, the pacing of this film is mind-numbingly slow and dramatic tension is diluted by too many inconsequential scenes, including most of the opening sequences involving co-star Kelly Reilly, whose parallel story of addiction turns out to have just about exactly nothing whatever to do with anything. A scene involving a conversation in a hospital stairwell among Washington, Reilly, and James Badge Dale as a mysterious, incoherent, smack-talking terminal cancer patient– which the audience is supposed to understand as A Deeply Meaningful Message – is one of the most glaring of the film's several painfully superficial shaggy dog stories. The film's moment of Great Moral Reckoning, which comes as Washington's Whitaker is on the witness stand during an NTSB hearing, is unbelievable from start to finish—first because the chief investigator would never have asked the question that results in Whitaker's epiphany and, second, because the film deliberately fails to provide the elements necessary to grasp why Whitaker behaves as he does in that moment. His decision seems arbitrary—as does his almost every act throughout the film. John Goodman, as Whitaker's pusher, reprises his Arachnophobia role to no great effect.",6,1,2,11 November 2012
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Not a new moon: just the same old, moralizing moon as before.
","By far the best of the three to date, which isn't necessarily saying much. At least Eclipse has a plot that makes some actual, coherent sense, and events are set up and fully explained rather than just being dumped on the viewer without preparation. There's a new director in town (each chapter has had a different director; Chris Weitz of Twilight II was truly a hack), and this one appears to understand things like pacing. The moralistic propaganda continues to spew forth at high volume, and what's interesting is that Bella emerges here as the little slut: she's leading two men on, passionately throwing herself at both of them; she's the one who wants to become a vampire, and she's the one who tries to seduce Edward, despite the risk to her (he declines not because he might, in the heat of passion, eat her, but because he's an old-fashioned guy who doesn't believe in sex before marriage). What's so addictive about the series, which could perhaps also be said of all High Romances, is that it posits the 'loved one' as the absolute center of the entire universe: no one worries about his job or because his boss is a jerk or, for that matter, about being unemployed; no one needs money; no one suffers from depression, anxiety, or loneliness; no one wonders about the purpose of her or his life; no one has any problems whatsoever except those caused by love; the human characters rarely eat, sleep, study, read, or participate in other normal activities. When the couple relationship is life's only issue, life becomes extremely simple. Of course, given the nature of the story, it is a highly dramatic and unstable life, but that's also par for the adolescent course: jealousies are invented; problems appear in the relationship out of thin air (maybe I'm not right for you; you love me, but you don't love me enough; no, I must leave you forever, it's the only way!); the tenor, color, and direction of Bella's entire existence shifts 180 degrees on the basis of a single conversation; and the extended cast is swept into the innumerable conflicts that are born in the effort to preserve the couple at all costs (indeed, Bella and Edward's friends and family barely have existences of their own and have no function other than to provide support for the tribulations and ordeals of the couple). The acting, on the whole, never rises above mediocre: Taylor Lautner's Valley Boy demeanor and Keanu Reeves-like blankness makes him Hollywood's most unconvincing Indian (though it was an excellent move when, halfway through Twilight II, he lost his dreadful long-hair wig and went back to his military cut). He's beautiful-ugly: the over-pumped, muscular body that threatens to consume his head, his bizarrely developed trapezius muscles, the world's tiniest nipples (I'm not the only one who noticed: they were Photoshopped for his shirtless movie posters), and a nose that spreads from ear to ear. His face is substantially without expression, though he's terrifying when he smiles. Still there are moments, most often when he's filmed in the middle distance, when his statuesque presence is affecting indeed. Robert Pattinson has a hard time forcing any genuine emotion through that pancake makeup, which is, to a greater or lesser extent, a problem that afflicts the entire cast of vampires; Kristen Stewart's Bella, meanwhile, mostly leaves you not understanding why Edward and Jacob are ready to rip each other to shreds over her; Bella is a stubborn, demanding, bourgeois princess with all the depth and personality of Formica. What do they see in her? Maybe it'll be revealed in the next ten installments. One thing is for sure: Despite the relentless hype about the way the Twilight series is a demonstration of 'girrlpower,' Bella is no Buffy. She's pushy and willful but not strong, impulsive but not thoughtful, imperative but committed to nothing and no one beyond her own desires. Most important of all, she has made her man the entire purpose and fulcrum of her existence, ready to abandon everything (including her parents) in order to Be With Him. That makes her a relic, not a role model.",4,12,19,5 July 2010
Gangs of New York," Retire, Martin, retire!!!
","Daniel Day-Lewis plays a Bill Sykes-send up with a truly laughable makeup job and an accent that's as carefree as the wind. You never really know why he hates Irish immigrants so much (a mere generation away from being an immigrant himself), and you never understand why everyone in The Five Points slum is so loyal toward and protective of him when he does absolutely nothing to alleviate the poverty and squalor of their senseless, miserable lives. (Oh yeah, since his legitimate front is as a butcher, he occasionally throws a decent steak their way.) Don't get me started on Cameron Diaz, The Whore With The Heart of Gold (because THAT's a story that hasn't been told enough) who, inexplicably is the only character in the movie with clean teeth. Liam Neeson, who croaks before the end of the first reel, is one lucky bastard.After the first 20 minutes, of course, anyone not watching the movie in Braille understands perfectly what the one and only dramatic issue is going to be (REVENGE!!) and you can step out for Chinese while the movie drags its ass toward its inevitable and tedious conclusion. Granted, *Gangs* might have made some use of the obvious Shakespearean themes, but Scorsese doesn't even try to handle them. Thus, though you might entertain a flicker of interest in the Hamletesque question of whether the son will avenge the father, you wind up so bored w/DiCaprio that you don't freakin' care anymore by the time he gets around to doing the deed (which is rather done for him before he even bothers to show up).In fact, though Leonardo keeps staring out at you from that bland little face and trying to convince you that he's struggling with Complex Moral Issues, the fact is: Every single person in this movie is reprehensible and evil, with differences in degree but never in kind. And if there are no good guys, why are you supposed to be cheering at the climactic scene when (for about the 11th time) the streets yet again run gooey w/blood and body parts? And yet, Scorsese tries. Toward the end of the movie, he picks up the nearest blunt instrument and bashes away at the plot until he's grafted an obvious hero (DiCaprio) and an irrelevant hetero love story (DiCaprio and Diaz) onto it. In other words, Martin Scorsese has nothing but contempt for you. You're too stupid to realize that DiCaprio's character is a venal, murderous little crook and you'll be mollified by a pretty romance between him and a sociopathic pickpocket prostitute. Because the history of America began between the sheets.This is the movie you'd get if Oliver Stone and Hannibal Lecter collaborated on an American history epic, and it's about as cynical a piece of trash as I hope never again to see.",2,12,21,18 December 2009
