The Blair Witch Project," More Anticipation the fear
","To begin, I enjoyed the film, BOTH times I saw it.  but there a few things that bother me!  I also purchased the book by D. A. Stern...And WAS NOT impressed, now did this whole thing happen, if so to who.  If the idea was to make the general public believe that it WAS true then the book and movie should match! The Book states the HEATHER, MIKE and JOSH Were the actual people that disappeared, which makes you wonder when you see them at an awards ceremony or doing an interview.  I could go more in depth but if you want my opinion write me! Second thing...THE MOVIE, the way it was produced you are to belive that THE 3 ILM STUDENTS are actually filming the documentry BUT they screwed up! Last scene, after mike get's knocked out!  They show a CAMERA going up the stairs as heather's camera is coming down!  BOO BOO!  I'd say!  That ruined the whole effect!  Although I never noticed it till the second viewing! Thanks and write if you'd have some info for me to clear up WHO THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO if anyone at all!",Null,1,2,15 August 1999
