Alien 3," not as bad as people make it to be
","I've watched this movie countless times. At first I thought: what the...? but now it's changed. Just recently I decided to give the movie another chance, and it blew me away!! I can't explain, but suddenly everything just made sense to me, from the impressive gothic sets, to the actors, even to the alien creaure itself. Although not quiete at creepy as before, this new breed, succeed in recapping many emotions from the first film. Claustrophpia, angst and just the entire mood of the film! Damn Good!",8,2,3,20 January 2002
We Were Soldiers," good, but slow
","here it is, yet another 'Nam-story. And it does exactly the same thing so many other Hollywood-war-movies does: While the action sequences are top-notch and all 'Nam-footage was really good as well as the actors, everything before Gibson and his company goes to vietnam is just overly sappy and crappy. I know that is propably is useful to the films as far as establishing characters, but it's just too hollywood. And what is wrong with Madeleine Stowes upper lip? Anyways, the vietnam scenes are great and mostly succeeds in making up for the 'wifeycrap'.... And I really liked the fact that you for once has the chance to see the vietcongs as other than just cold killingmachines. so 3/5 just for the 'nam-scenes.",Null,0,1,12 May 2002
Blade II," Simply stronger, faster, better
","Just SO much better than the first one. I especially enjoyed the improved burning effect when the vampires died. And the Reapers? Just totally awesome. And Blade is just cooler than he ever was. Whistler is back and I think they pulled it off pretty good, though it seemed a bit 'easy'. -SPOILER- 'Well, they made him a vampire, but let's just give him this here stuff and that cure him!' hehe, see for yourself!",9,0,4,7 April 2002
28 Days Later...," big surprise to say the least
","I saw this movie last night at a premiere surprise event (where the cinema show you a coming movie and you don't know which) and I was blown away! Imagine my surprise, when I'm used to seeing more or less crappy hollywood pap every time we go! Although it had similarities with Romero's films, it can well stand on its own. Yes, I know some scenes were virtually lifted straight off those movies, but they're not rip-offs. They're called homages, see? The 'Vanilla Sky' sequence was stunning, and the action and scares kept sending audience into gasps and screams. the perfect Halloween picture and yet again proves that british cinema is more than capable of handling great horror movies! Dog Soldiers and now 28 days later are both definite top 10 horror material in my book!",Null,0,0,3 November 2002
A Beautiful Mind," a complete surprise
","When I saw this movie, I had no idea what to expect. I had no hopes and the trailer kindda made me think it to be a spymovie. Boy, was I mislead!!!!!This is a very emotional movie, covering a subject, that never really has been handled before; what goes on in the mind of a schizophrenic? I wont go into the plot, since it would spoil the movie too much (in my opinion) Russel Crowe simply shines as John Nash. He is definetely one of the best actors in our time and I sincerely hopes he get at least one award for his performance in this movie! and so does everybody else, but Crowe outshines them all. But I have to admit that Jennifer Connelly is simply beautiful and her on-screen chemistry with Crowe is magnificint! a must see 9 ouit of 10!!!!!!!!!",9,0,1,3 February 2002
Vanilla Sky," blew me away!!!!
","This movie blew me absolutely skyhigh! Scary and twisted plot like none other, except perhaps The Game and superb acting from Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. Cameron Diaz was downright scary as the stalking Julie Gianni and I always love Jason Lee. Can't he ever get a leading role for himself (read this, Kevin Smith!?) When I left the cinema, I felt like I had just left another, sick and twisted world. an absolutely must-see 9 out of 10",9,0,0,2 February 2002
