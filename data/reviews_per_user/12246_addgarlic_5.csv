The Blair Witch Project," What is the scariest thing you can think of?
","I used to be quite afraid of the dark.  I was afraid of what might be lurking in its depth.  Sometimes I would let my imagination run and let it dream up that unseen terror.  I can't remember what all I conjured up in my imagination, but I can remember how scared I had made myself.The Blair Witch Project did an effective job of tapping into this realm of my psyche.  It gave me a place to contemplate and imagine what was so terrifying out there in the darkness, to imagine what would be so frightening to me.  It gave me everything to do this - the situation, the setting, the myth, people whose mental state I can understand, the noises in the night, and of course, the dark.  It gave me everything except the visualization of the horror and left room for me to imagine it.  It didn't visually show me, but gave me all the tools to dream up that which scares me the most.  And that is truly frightening.What is the scariest thing you can think of?  I would venture to say everyone would have a different answer.  The Blair Witch Project doesn't try to paint it for you, but instead hands you the palette and brush.  Those who take and use the brush will have the most fun and scare out of this movie.",Null,0,0,7 August 1999
Aliens," marines, firebats, and a thousand hydralisks
","It's been more than ten years since I first saw the movie (when it scared the gall bladders out of a 11 year kid).  Now i am 21 and Aliens still moves, inspires and frightens me.  The marines with their pulse rifles and flamethrowers standing ground and firing away before the rushing swarm of a thousand vicious, armor-plated, acid-spewing creatures truly brings out the insanity and horror of their direst of situations.  Yet Ripley and the marines never backs down or gives up.  Even more beautifully ironic is the fact that a little girl, Newt, managed to survive, equipped only will and wit.  This is the region in the human spirit that screams survival, adaptation, and 'never give up'.",10,1,2,20 July 1999
Independence Day," stupid...
","...that is the first word that comes to mind when ID4 is mentioned.  And this even works on several levels.(1) i am software engineer (and good one at that), and i find the idea of taking down the entire alien defensive matrix by uploading some joe-6-pack virus to be beyond, well, stupid.  And with a Mac, no less!  Most porn sites on the internet have more security than the aliens.  Maybe someone uploaded a plot-retardant virus into the script during filming.(2) Actually, i would have found the virus bit to be lighthearted, ironic, or funny IF the rest of the movie was in the least say, appealing, or personable.  But that was clearly too much to ask.  The conversations were predictable, cliche, and forced.  The story tried to pack in romance, religion, family values, patriotism, conspiracy, and the kitchen sink and did a horrible job on every aspect.(3) There were some redeeming qualities to this movie.  The suspense at the beginning was appreciated.  However, the resolution (as in the rest of the movie) was rather preditable and boring.  and uh... well that's about it.This movie is once again another mindless plug-and-chug of notable actors and special effects into the Hollywood summer-movie formula (hey, at leastArmageddon was kinda entertaining).  lucrative it may be, but automatically make a decent movie it does not.",3,1,2,25 July 1999
X-Men: The Last Stand," travesty - i think fox is paying people to inflate the ratings
","This movie is sadly disappointing, one of those things I wish we could unmake. It takes the fantastic x-men universe built over 40 years and through Bryan Singer's two movies and feeds it mercilessly to the Hollywood standard formula, without regard or respect to the ideas that makes X-Men endlessly intriguing. The conflicts of philosophy between Prof. X, Magneto, humans of various views show us that every side has its story and that there is no simple solution. X-Men: The Last Stand takes a giant dump on this beautiful conflict and simplifies everything to a thin gruel. The cure is absurdly handled, it hints at 'choice' but never consequences, and motivates action without contemplation. It alters and betrays the very ideas that makes X-Men entertaining, awe-inspiring, thought-provoking.It's interesting that on this opening night, there is a 7.9 rating, with a preposterous amount of 10's, with the top-ranked reviews ranking it very favorably, only to be followed by a sea of bad reviews. Does this seem a bit suspicious to anyone?Anyway, it's a shame, on so many levels.",3,7,14,27 May 2006
The Game," David Fincher and polarity
","The Game is unusual.  Very few movies succeeds in encapsulating such a compelling plot that consciously subverts the intellect.  After watching the entire movie and thinking back on the various situations, it would at first seem rather unlikely given the ending.  I like to offer this: there is more than meets the eye.  Perhaps a little 'movie magic', if you will.  I leave it at that.It's hard to believe that David Fincher also directed Alien 3.  I pull my hair out in frustration over that folly (read my review for 'Alien^3' to understand).  But i applaud The Game.  it is a movie that so effectively conveys the mood, fear, and every twist.",7,0,0,22 July 1999
