The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Please stop comparing these films to Battle Royale!
","They're totally different in mood, feelings, and content. Hunger Games gets to see a female lead and one who doesn't have to use sex or promiscuity to be powerful! That alone makes this book/film franchise a winner in America. People, please remember that most stories are merely adaptations of other stories told before, just like with Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland, A Christmas Carol, etc. There have simply been too many creators writing for too many years for anything to be truly fresh and original anymore. Almost every story you read or film you watch is lifted from a story told before (think about Disney-Almost none of their films are original, yet everyone loves them!). So while you're bashing all of the Rip-Off artists, like Suzanne Collins, just think about how many of your favorite books or films may have been stolen from someone else's idea, perhaps even hundreds of years ago.",7,36,47,20 March 2015
