Ghost," One of the most powerful and moving movies of all time.
","I first watched this movie on TV when I was about 8 and just had to ask my mom to rent it and I've watched it a dozen times ever since, My mom never let me watch the pottery scene when I was little lol. Anyway ghost tells the story of a manhatten yuppie couple Sam wheat(Patrick Swayze) and Molly Jensen(Demi Moore) who have just moved into a fancy apartment and wanna spend the rest of there lives together. There is that classic love pottery scene I was talking about where Sam and molly really show how much they love each other while the classic tune unchained melody by the righteous brothers plays on the disc jockey. Sam works at a bank along with his friend Carl bruner(Tony Goldwyn) and Sam notices something fishy going on at the bank when Sam discovers too much money is magically appearing in his accounts. Sam Molly are walking home from a movie later that night until a man Willy Lopez(Rick aviles) approaches them with a gun and asks Sam for his wallet and they fight and the gun goes off and shoots Sam. Sam can be seen running down the street but it's his ghost as he looks down at his dead body. Molly is saddened deeply by his death and later Sam's ghost sees his killer break into there apartment to look for Sam's wallet. Sam then teams up with a psychic lady Oda Mae brown(Whoopi Goldberg) to help him connect with molly to warn her that she's in danger from a similar fate. Soon Sam finds out that his so called friend Carl was behind Sam's murder all along and that he hired Willy to steal his wallet which had the mac code for Sam's account. Sam cannot move things and watches in disgust while Carl hits on Molly. Sam then turns to another ghost who haunts the subways of new york and is able to touch things and Sam ask's for his help and eventually learns to move things with his mind. Sam then takes Oda Mae to pose as a a fake customer by the name of Rita miller to close the account that Carl was supposed to get four million dollars. The bad guys then soon come after Molly and Oda Mae and Sam has to protect them and both bad guys end up dead and taken to hell and finally Sam gets one last moment with his beloved one before going to heaven.One of my most favorite movies of all time it is a mixture of romance, action, comedy, and thriller. Patrick swayze, Demi Moore, and Whoopi Goldberg all give brilliant performances. Tony Goldwyn and Rick aviles were also terrific as the villains of this story. Classic movie and highly recommend it for everyone.",Null,1,1,23 July 2010
Rocky V," Why all the haters??! very good movie and highly underrated.
","All I can ask is why did so many people including Sly himself dislike this movie? I think people miss the point of this movie and that is that Rocky (sylvester stallone) didn't cherish the money and fame it was his family and friends that he loved and he didn't need money to make him happy. I know it was bull to see him lose all his money and he won't be able to support his family like he used to but Rocky proved that he can make it without being rich. Anyway this movie takes place right after rocky's most dangerous fight with Ivan drago. Paulie (Burt young) gives power to rocky's accountant and Rocky loses all his money.Now Rocky, Adrian(talia shire and his son Rocky jr.(sage stallone) move into Paulie's house in Rocky's old neighborhood and he keeps getting hassled by a slimeball fight promoter named George washington duke and apparently he wants to make rocky money by having him get in the ring again but rocky refuses because he knows that duke is part of the dirty part of the boxing business. Rocky walks into his old trainer Mickey's gym in one scene and starts hallucinating and he sees when Mickey used to train him and this is probably my favorite scene in rocky 5.Anyways a young and hungry fighter Tommy gunn(Tommy morrison) come into rocky's gym and makes a bad impression to rocky and he asks rocky to train him and after saying no a couple times Rocky decides to train tommy gunn. Meanwhile rocky jr is getting bullied at school and feels ignored at home by rocky. Jr. starts learning how to fight and then finally beats up the school bully.Things seem to be going pretty well between rocky and tommy but then duke starts to manipulate tommy into fighting for him and tommy then starts to change his attitude and we later see he basically used rocky and all tommy cared about was money. After tommy gunn beats the world heavyweight boxing champ Union cane(who won the title by it being manufactured) tommy is getting heat from the fans for not thanking rocky instead of duke. This anger's tommy and he feels he is in rocky's shadow and Duke manipulates him by saying that rocky never cared for him. In the meantime rocky and his son reconcile and they are home team again.So tommy and the press go to the bar that rocky and his friends hang out and challenges rocky to fight. Rocky nearly laughs in his face and refused to fight tommy. It wasn't until Tommy physically assaulted Paulie when rocky decided to fight him and Rocky and tommy brawl in a street fight and rocky wins in the end. Very good movie and I am one of the few people who like this movie and as much as I like rocky 3 and 4 I feel that rocky 5 was more realistic and wanted to go back to the roots of the first 2 movies. 10/10",Null,3,5,26 May 2010
Home Alone," My most favorite movie of all time.
","I just got to say that this is the best movie ever made and it's my favorite movie of all time It's funny, entertaining, unrealistic which makes it great I know a lot of people say this movie is unrealistic but I think thats what makes the movie so much fun and I'm sure john hughes was aware that this movie was unrealistic and I think a lot of movies should be like this. Whenever I want to escape reality for a couple of hours I pop this movie in because it's a childhood favorite and I grew up watching this movie. I am upset that I never got to see this movie in theaters but I did catch the sequel in theaters back in 92 and I will review that movie next because I love that one just as much. Anyway I highly recommend home alone 1 and 2 for everyone. home alone 3 is tolerable but I don't highly recommend it and don't see 4 please unless you want to watch garbage.",10,0,1,20 May 2010
Rocky II," Really great sequel!!
","It's the rematch of the century as Rocky takes on Apollo creed. Sequels rarely live up to the original but I think this is one of the few that do. This story takes place right after the first rocky/apollo fight as Rocky and Apollo are taken to the hospital. Apollo(Carl weathers) immediately challenges Rocky(Syylvester stallone) in a rematch for the heavyweight title and Rocky tells him and the press that he is retiring. Life seems to be going great at first for Rocky and his now wife Adrian(Talia shire.They get a new apartment, car, watches, and they seem to be doing great for awhile. But then Rocky starts to have a hard time finding a job and he can't do commercials because he can't read. Then his best friend Paulie(Burt young) gets him a job at the meat packing place he works at but then Rocky gets canned right away because he hasn't worked there long enough. Meanwhile Apollo creed is suffering from the press and they are calling him a fake and they think the fight was fixed. This angers Apollo and he humiliates Rocky on TV. Thats when Mickey(Burgess meredith comes in and wants to train Rocky again. Adrian doesn't approve so Rocky starts training like crap and it doesn't get better when she gets in a coma but she wakes up after a couple of days and they have there newborn baby Rocky jr.Now Adrian approves and Rocky starts training hard again and it's time to fight Apollo creed in the rematch of the century. All in all a very great sequel thats a lot like the first but the big fight at the end is really good and it keeps you at the edge of your seat! recommended for anyone.10/10",Null,0,0,24 May 2010
Rocky IV," Another great sequel!!!
","You would think that by this time the series would go downhill but it doesn't. Sylvester stallone, Talia shire, Burt young, Carl weathers and introducing Dolph lundgren all star once again in Rocky 4. This movie takes place a little after the third movie after Rocky had just faced for what has to be his most powerful opponent Clubber lang. A Russian fighter by the name of Ivan drago (Dolph lundgren) comes to America with his wife and the Russian politicians. Rocky's now good friend Apollo creed wants to fight this new Russian because he feels that the russians are trying to make them look bad. Apollo believes that once your a fighter that is who you are and people can't change. Rocky doesn't really like the idea of Apollo fighting Drago right away because they know nothing about him.Apollo decides to make one hell of an entrance before his fight with Drago but in the end he won't be making much of an exit. Drago kills apollo literally in the second round and rocky goes into another depression and he decides to fight Drago in Russia and of course Adrain (Talia shire) disapproves because she saw what Drago is capable of. Rocky said that he's a fighter and thats the way he's made and he goes to Russia without Adrian and brings Paulie (Burt young) and tony duke(Apollo's trainer Tony burton) and Duke trains rocky in Russia.Rocky has no real equipment in Russia and Rocky trains ghetto like sawing wood and chopping down trees and running up a mountain while Drago on the other hand has all the high tech equipment and sparring partners and he takes steroids. Adrian eventually comes down to Russia to support rocky. The biggest fight of rocky's life is now on and at first the Russian fans boo and jeer at rocky but it wasn't until they saw rocky's determination and heart that they started cheering for him.Really good 4th entry in the series and this had my favorite music. Dolph lundgren was very intimidating and mysterious as the Russian fighter Ivan drago. Yeah this movie was probably the most unrealistic in the series but thats what makes it fun. Love it 10/10",Null,0,1,24 May 2010
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Best sequel ever made!!
","I love this movie just as much as it's prodecessor I had the pleasure of seeing this movie in theaters in 92 and I've watched it a zillion times ever since This movie is almost exactly the same as the original except this times he's in new york and this one has Tim curry and Rob schneider and they are a joy to watch in this one. Highly recommended for everyone. This movie basically takes place a year after the original and it starts out exactly the same as the first, Kevin gets into a fight with Buzz and he is forced to sleep in the attic again and the electricity goes out again and the McCallisters are in another rush to the airport and this time Kevin follows a guy who looks like his dad and he ends up getting on a plane to New york. While there he runs into the same bumbling burglars from the first movie and they are ready for a big holiday heist and it's up to Kevin to try and stop them. Very funny and the traps are even more violent and hilarious.",Null,0,1,20 May 2010
Rocky," Best sports movie ever made!!
","I actually saw most of the sequels to this movie before this one But I still think this one is the best, storywise. The movie is about a philadelphia club fighter and collector named Rocky balboa (Sylvester stallone) who is going absolutely nowhere in life. He collects money from people and beats them up and gives the money to a loan shark named Gazzo. He has a good friend named Paulie (Burt young) who drinks a lot and they both have nobody but each other. For awhile Rocky has been trying to get a date with Paulie's shy sister Adrian (Talie shire) but she is too shy to go out with anyone. But on thanksgiving night Paulie gets Adrian to date him and they go ice skating.Rocky also works out in a gym owned by Mickey goldmill (Burgess meredith) and Mickey is always yelling at rocky because he feels rocky had the potential to be big but he wasted his talents by working for a cheap second-rate loan shark as Mickey referred Gazzo. Meanwhile the world heavyweight boxing champion Apollo creed(Carl weathers) original fight with a fighter named Mack lee green ducks out and doesn't want to fight Apollo. The fighter claims to have broken his right hand or something.So Apollo has to find another fighter to fight and he chooses rocky balboa because he thinks the sound of it sounds like a monster movie and it would make Apollo look good and Apollo plans on finishing him in 2 rounds. Rocky on the other hand acceptes the challenge and then starts getting trained by Mickey. From then on Rocky starts training like crazy and creates his own style of training and this includes punching meat, drinking raw eggs and tieing a string to his feet so he can learn to balance. But yeah all in all this movie is of pure brilliance and the character of rocky has become an icon everywhere. The acting, the music by Bill conti, Rocky and Adrian's relationship, the training and the big fight at the end makes this movie a classic.This movie is about more than just fighting it's also about the character of Rocky trying to prove himself and to show everyone that he doesn't care about winning and he just wants to go the distance and say he did it. It's about Rocky overcoming all odds and that you don't really have to win to win. After fighting the most dangerous fighter and going the distance and showing everyone that you have the guts and determination and heart you have won something that is bigger than a belt. 10/10",Null,0,0,24 May 2010
Rocky III," My favorite one in the series.
","This is my favorite Rocky movie of the whole series mainly because of the fast paced fights, the action and Mr. t. This movie takes place three years after the second movie after Rocky has beaten the world heavyweight champion Apollo creed. life couldn't be better for Rocky balboa(Sylvester stallone). He now has a mansion with his wife Adrian balboa(Talia shire), He's got everything, cars, money, he's doing commercials and he's beaten 10 opponents since he became champion.He still hangs out with his best friend Paulie (Burt young) and Rocky even does charity bouts like fighting against the world wrestling champion Thunderlips (Hulk hogan). But Rocky is unaware that a new fighter by the name of Clubber lang (mr. t), has been watching Rocky in his fights and scouting him and Clubber lang is pulverizing his opponents to get to the top. Only Mickey (Burgess meredith) recognizes Clubber's strength and tries to keep Rocky away from him. Mickey is only giving him fights with people who are steup to lose.At a statue unveiling Rocky decides to retire but Clubber lang comes out of the shadows and challenges him to a fight and Rocky thinks he is just another fighter but Mickey tells him the truth and he thinks Rocky wouldn't stand a chance against him. But rocky convinces mickey to train him but Rocky starts training like a showman,(having the press watch him train, renting out a fancy gym where people sing while he trains).Just before the fight is about to begin Rocky and Clubber almost go at it backstage but then Mickey starts having heart problems. Mickey tells rocky to just go and he does and Clubber lang whips him pretty good and knocks rocky out in the second round. Just after that Mickey dies and Rocky goes into a deep depression and almost hangs up his gloves, that is until an old foe of his Apollo creed(Carl weathers) comes to his aid and decides to train Rocky for a rematch agains the ferocious Clubber lang. But rocky is feeling guilty about micks death and he blames himself and only Adrian can bring rocky to stop blaming himself and and realize that micks death was not his fault and that mickey was only protecting him when he put him against the setup fighters. Now rocky starts training like his old self and Apollo teaches hima new way of fighting where rocky can stick and move and block. Now it's the rematch against clubber lang and Rocky will prove that even if he loses he will have lost with no excuses and no fear as Adrian said to him earlier.I love this movie of the series and I think it had a good message that if you lose something and you learn from it, you never really lost it to begin with. And it takes a hell of a man to recapture something you once loved. All of the actors are tremendous in this movie. Sylvester stallone proved once again that he can act and Talie shire was wonderful as usual. Burt young was great as the loving jealous brother in law. I think it was cool and exciting to see Carl weathers' character Apollo creed to swallow his pride and become rocky's friend and trainer. And of course Mr.t was great as the ferocious, mean and nasty clubber lang and he gave a new meaning to the word tough. I think this role should have won him a supporting actor nominee.",Null,0,0,24 May 2010
The Wizard of Oz," Timeless classic that will live forever!!!
","I don't know where to start I mean this movie is just so great that words can't describe it I absolutely love it. Every character and actor in this movie is just wonderful and outstanding. I still watch this movie with my girlfriend sometimes and she usually laughs because she thinks this movie is too old. One of my favorite things about this movie is the friendship between Dorothy, the scarecrow, tin man, and the lion I think the way they look out for each other and wanna help each other is really heartwarming. I gotta say my favorite character in this movie is the Wicked witch of the west I mean she is so terrifying and creepy and she does not even lay a hand on anyone this film and yet she still is menacing. I give this movie 10/10.",Null,1,2,21 May 2010
