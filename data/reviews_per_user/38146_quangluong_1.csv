Ford v Ferrari," Unnecessary final death scene!
","Ok this is only my point of view why they have to show the dead scene of the main character I think they should have end it when the race end , and maybe wrote a line of his death cause at the end of the movie just to not bring down the feeling, overall it is a masterpiece there are not many film about racing and car , just a small detail that I don't like again just my perspective 10/10",10,1,4,9 February 2020
