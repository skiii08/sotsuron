The Blair Witch Project," Terrifyingly Real.
","Clever and TERRIFYING! You must see it , it is so real you will be genuinely scared. I've talked to many people who were trembling with fear after this movie. It CAN NOT be compared to any other horror film. Although Friday the 13th , Nightmare on Elm St , and Scream are excellent movies - you know that they are just a movie , where as Blair Witch lets you envision it as REAL footage. SEE IT - To understand.",6,2,3,29 May 1999
The Blair Witch Project," It unfortunately let me down.
","I had been eagerly waiting to see this for a month or two now. Being a HUGE horror fan I couldn't wait to see this due to the huge buzz about how scary and creative it was.But I've got to say this movie let me down a lot. The few scary scenes are hardly unsettling or truly scary, although there is a *slight* creep out factor in them.Since most of the movie does not attempt to be scary, there are a few good laughs in it. Actually the comic parts of it are better at being funny than the scary parts are at being scary.**ALSO** Some people are going to see this movie under the impression that it is real footage that was found ...or that it was a shot by shot remake of real footage that was found...Which is not true! But under this impression I could see how the movie would seem a lot better than it does to those who know it was all made up.ALL IN ALL  I give it 1  1/2  stars  or 2  out of four. I really wish it was better, it was good concept. The 2 guys that made it are cool, and had a great idea.",6,1,4,18 July 1999
Pi," Not very enjoyable
","I was expecting something different I suppose. The movie was hard to watch from the beginning, but I made myself watch it to see what kind of amazing breakthroughs may happen. It's pretty dull. It turns out nothing really clearly comes about,...they do it in a way that never makes you think 'wow..that's clever....what an amazing idea'.. you never get pleasantly shocked by it. It still had some interesting idea's though. Here is what the movie feels like: Sinus pressure, black and white fuzz on your TV screen, on.off.on.off...buzz...ring...thoughts...thinking...numbers taunting your mind..ahhh..scream For some reason the movie Cube gets compared to this movie a lot, in which case I'd like to say Cube is 100x better. I would never watch Pi again.",4,1,2,25 July 2001
Mulholland Drive," Lynch's most detailed & intelligent movie.
","Not only is this Lynch's best movie, this is one of the best movies ever made. It MUST be watched at least twice to even begin to connect all the events and figure out what was really going on. There is so much attention to detail and meaning in the scenes, images, objects and acting...it is seriously amazing. The sound, music, writing, directing...EVERYTHING has so much thought put into it's incredible. I wish there were more movies with this much effort put into them that I could watch. I'm really looking forward to what Lynch is working on next.10/10 no question. You MUST watch this movie. Pay attention to every part of everything.",10,5,8,24 April 2003
Cube," Intriguing
","I finally saw this, and it is really good. I was entertained and compelled all the way through. The semi-disappointing ending makes me rate it an '8'...but the ambiguity of the ending is also what makes it a movie that people need to have discussions about afterwards. The movie shows that the human beast is more deadly than this giant death cube of astronomical possibilities. (the cube which represents life/universe...or the system)",8,0,1,22 July 2001
The Breakfast Club," Totally 80s - Totally awesome
","One of the best movies ever - good characters - amazing writing. -you must see it.Period. -defines the 80s, along with other Hughes' greats:Ferris Buellers day off, Pretty in Pink etc...",10,0,1,11 September 1999
Donnie Darko," A great movie that you have to see.
","This movie is great. It was hard to come up with a solid rating for how much I liked it, but the more I learn about it (The Philosophy of Time Travel), the more I think about it -- trying to work it all out in my head and the more I watch the movie and start noticing subtle little hints and things, the more I love it and realize how truly great it is.
 I love how this movie has much more to understand and dig into deeper for those who actually want to take the time to understand everything and every aspect of the movie and why things happened. But at the same time for those who DON'T dig into the movie any further than just watching it...the movie still makes all it's points about about fate, life, love and course of actions. It gives you so few real answers in the end, that you are forced to think about this movie.  The production itself was also great the mood and atmosphere were effective, the acting was good, the comedy was real and funny, the creepiness was creepy in a believable way, the feelings of characters was well portrayed, each song fit meaningfully into the movie and created an emotional poignancy.....I'll just stop talking now, and hope that you decide to see this movie now.",10,0,2,30 January 2003
