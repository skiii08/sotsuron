Sucker Punch," Snyder's Mulholand Drive about traumas and fighting them. Analysis.
","This isn't Mulholand Drive (the masterpiece), but I think it follows the same principals. As in Mulholand what you see on screen it's not the reality, it's just subconscious fantasy.The action in the whore house and the action part is a subconscious alternate reality. The disgusting reality is in the asylum.The impressive dance is certainly not a sexy dance that none can resist. All dances are in reality the patients re-acting of their traumatic experiences. Baby dolls' dance is amazing to all because her story is simply amazing, as we've seen in the superb first 7 minutes (I must have already watched the emotional galore of 'sweet dreams' like 10 times).The cgi/action scenes is actually Baby Doll fighting her demons, sometimes the step father appears with the veeery long spear, with a little help from her new made friends (now she has help, she's not scared, she will fight and win). Sometimes I could make sense of a few details, most of them I didn't get them...(anyone did please let me know??) In reality their plan inside the asylum of getting the map etc is very naive. They stole the map from the office, and didn't photocopy it, so obviously the 'dr' got the plot since there was no map behind his desk, same thing with the missing lighter--how can he not notice it missing.By the way i think that the psycho doctor's speeches were accurate in both levels. What he says works for both worlds and is actually baby dolls 'plot points' for both worlds.The map, the key, the knife and the lighter are just her last memories before the lobotomy. Her subconscious took them, put them together and there you have your story.To conclude, this kind of movie for a commercial creator is a big surprise. No wonder that his action packed fan base was frustrated and disappointed. They should have been warned that this is another universe from his previous films. Here, the action scenes are metaphoric and they don't drive the plot!Personally, I loved many parts of the film, especially the haunting sweet dreams and the white rabbit. Especially the first one is one of my most haunting film scenes ever. It almost convinced me to fight my demons as baby doll did!I won't give a 10, only because Snyder didn't succeed on helping us understand her subconscious--her real fight. There could have been many ways of hinting us more things here and there or at least at the last part of the movie spend it in the asylum...Many ways for helping the audience getting it and be in awe. Its visuals and the directing/editing emotional value reach a superb level, it only needed a little more to become a masterpiece. Honestly.",8,4,7,25 June 2011
Star Trek," I missed the adventures in alien planets
","I think that there was a hype about the new Star Trek. They film isn't bad, but it definitely isn't great. I wished the origins would last like 30mins and then we would actually watch some REAL adventures. All this friendship drama and how they got united felt like a TV episode and not a movie to pay for. I wasn't surprised at all and didn't feel any excitement through out the movie. Quinto was excellent,but the guy who portrayed captain Kerk was very very boring and too'all American.' I missed the style, i missed the 'where no man has gonebefore' and the unknown. Under my opinion, there's potential to the newseries, but i'd wait a couple more of their films until the Enterprisecrew reaches it's full potential and we can actually enjoy a really exciting sci-fi adventure.",3,3,8,8 May 2009
The Irishman," I felt as if I've already seen it a million times before! Pure lack of originality!
","Scorsese knows his art, that's for sure, but maybe he shouldn't do any mafia films anymore. I mean, the Irishman had nothing original. Through-out the film it constantly reminded me of other mafia movies again and again. I wasn't surprised by anything and to be honest I stopped it half-way, because I was bored. I mean, I already knew its characters from other mafia movies, and I already knew what would happen next. Skip it if you have already watched many mafia films.",5,21,40,1 December 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Well done, but with a horrific impersonation of the super talented Freddie Mercury
","A Queen's movie will always be entertaining since it includes their amazing songs. That's the reason probably, why its rating is sooo high. People loved hearing their songs once again, me too, and of course loved them once more. Malek though. killed the movie for me... I had to avoid looking at his 'psycho' reactions through out the movie. Malek is not an actor, I think that he's always playing a character with 'esoteric issues.' Real Freddie for example also looks and performs like a genius. Mr. Robot suits him fine because the character is someone with esoteric issues that fit him.In my opinion you don't become Freddie Mercury neither by simply exposing his teeth (ridiculously too many times), nor by raising his arms and opening his mouth every time he sings! The acting was ridiculous, I only saw the Mr.Robot guy with a wig, fake teeth, and the 'psycho' deep voice! All this have nothing to do with the real Freddie! If you want to know what kind of a super talent Freddie was, just watch one of his lives. There you'll see all that you missed in this certainly missed opportunity film. .I love that the audience didn't focus on the impersonation's quality and liked the film, on the other hand I don't think that we'll see another 'Queen film' and that sucks, because we're left with this horrible impersonation of the amazing Freddie! God save the Queens!! :)",5,1,1,22 February 2019
Yesterday," Interesting Premise, but with very miserable & dull characters
","I always liked Danny Boyle, I love the Beatles, I was sure that this would be an interesting movie. Boy, I was so wrong! I mean, the characters were so cliche, so one-dimensional and extremely boring! Thank God that the Beatles songs were known to the public by them! It'd been such a dystopia if this almost brain-dead, dull at all levels, guy brought their songs first. The Beatles became a phenomenon not only because their music was unbelievably awesome & unique, but also because they were witty, cute, good looking, funny and had very interesting personalities.This film is such a disaster, just don't waste your time. The only reason I gave it a 3, instead of 1, is because of the Beatles songs, which I can't stop loving even when they're sung by a very uninteresting singer. There's nothing to watch here, better watch their live concerts or docs about the Beatles.",3,2,5,21 September 2019
Mamma Mia!," Feel good comedy we Greeks loved it!
","Went to an open theater last night here in Athens-Greece and all the audience was laughing their hearts out! Who cares about showing a bit of grotesque concerning 'modern Greece,' i wish the real Greece was as shown in Mamma Mia--all dancing and singing. Awesome! It might look a bit too much of a comedy, but that's the whole point. Just enjoy it,laugh your heart outs, don't' even think about criticizing it and just have a wonderful night with it. Entertaining at its best! When will you ever get a chance to travel to an ideal Greek island with Meryl Streep, Peter Brosnan, Julie Waters etc, all dancing and singing with super high comedy involved. No wannabes here, just chaotic entertainment!",8,106,203,5 July 2008
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," If we the 'audience' can't get the wreck of SW7, be prepared for even worst Star Wars films!
","I even loved the new ones. Even the Phantom Menace! Got into the theater ready to believe ANYTHING. But, the Force Awakens is so soft on all spots! Huge story holes, super-predictable and the 'new' 'heroes' lack any emotions and depth and star quality. Unfortunately Star Wars now follows Marvel and DC into making action driven, emotionless and plot hole movies... Our only hope on stopping this on going Star Wars parody is ONLY IF we the audience send the creators a powerful message against this horrible take on the Star Wars myth! Dear creators: 1)Don't copy-cat older Star Wars. 2)Be respectful to the audience and stop trying to fool us with stupid plot and stupid plot points.3)Create a NEW myth for the new heroes. Built it and convince us that the Force is soooo strong in them. We fans are READY to believe! Stop f@cking us around! We are not stupid!",4,18,26,28 December 2015
The Social Network," What a trash...! If u got brains simply avoid it!
","The social network to me is just another proof of recent mass hysteria where we can't distinct good from bad. This cheap drama-soap dramatically rewrites the history and I guess that's what made me angry. This is too much of a recent history and they're using real names in a docudrama setting. To me, this is history manipulation and not dramatization of a real story! 1)How lame that the Napster founder is played by the girls idol Justin. 2)How lame that he's talking about social networking as if he discovered it! Geez! Facebook just added a few very smart add ons, the social networking is certainly not their idea! I'd rather see a movie about the guys who actually did come up with the social networking idea i.e. profiles not for dating, but for friends. 3)Facebook is based mostly on cheating, lying, copying and misleading (i.e. Did u forget that back in the days we all used to receive this 'friends invitations to join facebook?' Do u remember that facebook once u joined misled u on entering Ur e-mail password and then hacked into Ur address book and sent ALL of them an invitation to join face-book without our permission??)This film is a horror film about how horribly well things work if Ur smart and unethical. As far as the film goes it technically work fine, it's interesting that Mark is somehow honest about himself not being such a nice person, but under my humble opinion this whole film is made to fill Mark's vanity issues and wanting to stay in history as the founder of social networking, which is simply a lie.",2,133,269,16 December 2010
