Catch Me If You Can," Yaya!
","Wonderful actors! Wonderful crew! The acting was so so SOOO good for every single character. Every actor fit every charcacter perfectly, it couldn't have been casted ANY better! Loved it LOTS. Really funny, Did it win any oscars? I dunno, I think it should have won SOMETHING.",Null,0,1,26 May 2003
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Much, Much Better than the First
","The Chamber of Secrets was always the scariest book, to me. And a lot of people, I think, kinda underestimated that. But when the movie came out, it looked a lot more scarier and it totally just jumped at you. Really surprised me! The acting has improved SO much since the first movie, and there was TONS more comedy (and it was actually really funny!) and the storyline is much more catchy. Good job to Cris Columbus and the cast and crew, really good job!!! I'd give it an 8/10.",Null,0,1,24 April 2003
