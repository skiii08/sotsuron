Blade Runner 2049," Best sequel that I've seen in my life. (Yes, that includes The Godfather and BTTF)
","This movie is just too damn good. It is the perfect sequel to the first one. Same visuals, same type of story telling, same aesthetics, amazing music, and a perfect follow up to the story. It is almost as it was filmed during the production of the first one (like BTTF 2).If you are thinking that probably is just a lame script that kind of worked like a sequel and then, Harrison Ford was hired just to make a few bucks, and is just a shitty movie that they put the name 'blade runner' as a bait, well I'm glad to tell you that you are ABSOLUTELY WRONG. Go see it, now.",10,7,17,13 October 2017
Joker," Just save your time and watch a Scorsese movie
","I mean, why bother with a bad copy? Just watch Taxi Driver and The king of comedy. Or better yet, take the DVD's, put them in an video editor, make random cuts of each and export a 2 hour movie with scenes of both. Watch it in bed when you are feeling sleepy so you get a little confused and I GUARANTEE you that you gonna get something pretty similar to the joker. Really.. not worth it.If you wanna watch an Scorsese type movie... just watch an Scorsese's movie.",4,20,61,4 October 2019
Parasite," Strange movie, but a good one.
","This is a dark comedy, no question about it. But is also an almost surreal movie. Very clever thought. This is the kind of movie that a lot of people want to do and fail badly. So if you are into dark comedy, strange movie, give it a go.",7,2,6,22 October 2019
