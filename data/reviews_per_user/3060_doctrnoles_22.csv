Scarface," Is Leonard Maltin on drugs?
","Leonard Maltin gave Scarface one star and a half.  Is he joking?  This movie was one of the best gangster movies I've ever seen!  It had everything; well-developed characters, great cinematography, and explosive action.  With a screenplay by Oliver Stone, how can you go wrong?  The only weakness in this movie is (spoiler ahead) when the goons try and blow up the ambassador's car.  The bomb looked like something out of a bad fifties sci-fi movie.  All in all, though, this movie rocked! 8/10",Null,0,0,3 January 2001
Se7en," Kids, Don't Kill in the Name of God
","SE7EN is quite an extroardinary film.  Unlike most films, which make everything sound so nice, this film bludgeons you with depressing images. The film is a ripe slice of hell, and is one film that you'll remember.  If you think you were pretty cool during the gruesome scenes, you'll probably have nightmares later.  David Fincher and writer Andrew Kevin Walker(wasn't he an assasin?  On no, that was Mark David Chapman) craft the film very well.  Every scene is framed well, and there is a feeling of bleakness. This film goes against the 'it's not what you think, it's what you're wearing' complacent culture to show the 'eminent death' culture.  Think about it, won't you?  Gwyneth Paltrow is talented, and cute too.  Brad Pitt is dumber than a bag of hammers, and Morgan Freeman is a noble savage. Kevin Spacey gave me the jim-jams something awful!

The Big Lebowski," Don't Give in to The Man!
","The Big Lebowski, man, he is, like, so cool!  I've never seen a movie that showed such a slacker and made being a slacker seem not so bad, and hey, I could get used to him.  The Cohen brothers are always petulant, but here it seemed like they just said, 'Let's have fun, and we're gonna film every minute of it.'  Hey, they're basically good eggs.  Those squares bug the dude, they really bug him.  The dude may sleep it off a bit too much, but he's got it all together upstairs.  Somebody's after his rug, and he smells a rat; a big Commie rat.  The main problem is that Lebowski's being terrorized by some hoods, and keeps wondering, 'hey, are these guys employed by anyone?'  The movie sure keeps you guessing, and the cast of the movie help to really dress it up.  Jeff Bridges-this is some of his best acting, John Turturro-he's good, 'cause he has nothing to do with the film, and Julianne Moore-we'll settle on looks.  I'm kidding, of course.  Also, catch Sam Elliot as Mr. Exposition; it's a good thing he's here to walk us around this movie. Rating: 10/10",Null,0,0,20 May 2001
Fight Club," Men, Enjoying their Manliness
","You are nothing special.  In fact, your mother loathes the day her bosom was smithed with your stinking presence.  This is one of the messages of Fight Club, an incredibly awesome film, by David Fincher, maker of films and fine sedatives.  This movie can be best described as twelve servings of intensity made to seem smaller so that they could be taken as two servings.  A new story-telling style is introduced every five minutes, and the characters keep evolving.  Who are these guys?  Neo-realists?  Be careful, and look out for realist gangs, who've been terrorizing the desolate streets of our cities, for half a century.  Edward Norton is incredible as the self-delluding, self-perpetuating loser.  (How is he any different than me?) Brad Pitt is incredible as Tyler Durgen, the Zorathustrian gang leader of Fight Club.  Helena Carter is great as Tyler's main squeeze.  She is one spooky chick in this movie!  My only problem is the end.  I don't want to be the 'you just ruined the movie, you idiot!' guy, but in the end, was Fincher expecting that anyone was still watching the film, or that everyone was making out by now?  Rating: 10/10 (As far as bleakness goes, this one's worse than Se7en)",Null,0,1,29 March 2001
Akira," Speed Racer 2: After the Apocalypse
","Akira is the best movie I have ever seen, and it's loaded with cool visuals to boot!  I'll elucidate:( I'll show you)  For starters, the comics( oops, they're not comics, they're graphic novels) are given new life in this anime and I've never seen such wonderful artwork.  I'm an artist, and watching this masterwork, I feel so insignificant.  Forgiving the fact that Akira is very violent, it's violence has a specific purpose.  Our world is becoming greedier and stupider, and we're all dead where we stand, unless we slow down, and stop trying to explore every inch of our territory.  If we don't, we'll be living in a scenic ground zero testing site, so lay off, you greedy politicians!  Just lay off!  Personally, I'd love to have inhuman abilities, so that if I got into a potentially dangerous situation, I could lash out at my opponents with inhuman strengths, like Akira.

The Beach," Huh?
","'Huh?' is right, when it comes to understanding the plot of this silly movie.  Just watch the part with the chick in the blue bikini, that's the best part, the rest was all just nonsense.  However, I really got into it, regardless; probably because of the superb craftsmanship of the movie itself.  This movie's not much without the visuals, the colors, and the music.  The haunting 'beach' theme was so pretty, so beautiful, that I could feel my eyes fill up with tears.  (I'm not being sarcastic.)  Well, this movie saves the best for the beginning, instead of saving something moving for the final scene.  I have a feeling that Leonardo was depressed about his part in this movie; maybe he was sulking because he turned down the lead in 'American Psycho'.  Robert Carlyle's character had a better story than the plot of this movie; you'll see what I mean.  In summation, if you run out of things to do, then see this film, and throw in a little Terence Malick afterwards.

Full Metal Jacket," You Have Got To Be Kidding Me, Pyle!
","Full Metal Jacket works a lot better when it's much more subtle.  For example, the 'preparation' for war via boot camp is so haunting, it makes the actual war look weaker by comparison.  The boot camp sequence is a ripe slice of hell, and the war is not really scary, but kind of goofy.  Does Kubrick see Vietnam as untidy?  I'm no historian but I think forests and humidity had to do with Vietnam.  All in all, this film is still really good, and should be watched by anyone interested in war movies.  As with Kubrick's other movies, the film is moody and introspective, and the boot camp sequence is ickier than other war movie sequences.  In my opinion, after the boot camp sequence, I though that Kubrick ran out of things to do. Rating: 7/10 (Kubrick's dead?  Somebody should tell him!)",Null,0,0,11 March 2001
American Psycho," What pretentious c**p
","Yes, you too can learn to make a film in three easy lessons.  After watching this stinkburger, I want to take the first in a series of cold showers, because this film is just dirty and oily.  (SPOILERS)  The way Bateman calously knocked off twenty or so innocent people, I love how he never changes.  At the end, Bateman should sit in his posh club while the faces of those he's wronged flash before his eyes, but instead he just thinks, 'hey, that was neat!'.  I wanted to slap this movie, or at least pistol whip Bateman.  Hey, no means no Patrick!  This film is not healthy for anyone, and I can't watch it again.  The treatment of the kitten is just plain wrong.  That's someone's kitten, not an ATM card!  As for the comedy, it wasn't ha ha funny, or even a quiet laugh.  Poor kitten, poor labrador, poor us!  Christian Bale has done some bad movies, but this is really embarassing.  Music by The Super Mario Brothers.  I can't believe there was a crew for this movie.  Even the movie FLESH AND BLOOD didn't have this much flesh and blood! Rating: 1/10 (Christian Bale looks like Tom Cruise at the funhouse)",Null,0,1,5 February 2001
American Beauty," Amazing!
","I loved this film!  In my opinion, it was the best use of color, characters, and, of course, roses, that I've seen in a long, loong time.  This is an American movie, but not the 'We've got to help George Bailey' kind of cheesy film.  Nobody in this film really hits it off, and after watching it, I thought 'all life is travesty'.  I kept telling myself that 'I bet someone in this film turns out to be good!'  Regardless, this film is unbelievably cool, and I'm not just saying that because I'm on the payroll.  It rocks. It's not just Kevin Spacey that's free, it's the human spirit.  Now, I gotta go, 'cause I'm double parked. Rating: 10/10 (Chris Cooper is dangerous to himself and others)",Null,0,0,26 February 2001
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," I Don't Know Why
","Terminator 2 is incredible, and I've killed three minutes writing this review.  The action is frantic and awesome, and I never get tired of seeing the T-1000 morphing into different shapes.  After I saw it, I wanted to hit the sheets, because I was exhausted!  I saw the director's cut, with those scenes that didn't originally appear in the movie that they restored. Aren't you glad?  It's boss!  If you don't know the plot, pinch yourself hard, 'cause you deserve it.  Unless you watch movies in another country, than you know what it's about.  I bet everyone in the world knows what this dog's about.  In summary, watch this movie if you want to see some surrealist action filmaking. Rating: 10/10 (You should see the T-1000 with vegetables!)",Null,1,1,29 April 2001
Aliens," This Is a Bug Hunt, maan!
","What can I say about Aliens, that hasn't already been said before?  The twenty minute shoot-out at the finale was so much, at one point I was saying to myself 'That's it!  I'm leaving.'  After every avenue of diplomacy has been navigated, this movie just ends up becoming one giant butt-kicking fest; aliens vs. marines.  Those marines suits were covered in Wicker Armor, courtesy of Pier One imports, so the armor didn't work too well, but it was just decorative.  Maybe in the future we humans should rotate to the other side of the galaxy, where the mutant aliens don't live.  A prehistoric mutant hellbeast beats a human armed with a machine gun any day of the week. This was some of Sigourney's best acting right here, and Paul Reiser was good as the corporate raider, who goes along for the Company.  My only complaint was that the models in this movie were much much cheesier than the sets I've seen in a lot of other sci-fi movies.  All in all, just stay frosty, and you'll make it through this one! Rating: 10/10",Null,0,0,18 May 2001
The Usual Suspects," This movie rocks!
","Whoa!  This movie was a mind-blowing action thriller, and I can't recommend it enough to anyone in the mood for a great crime thriller/mystery. (SPOILERS)  I loved all the intricate plot elements, such as Verbal Kint being Keyser Soze, and all of the other guys being duped into killing the snitch who was about to tell the customs agents about Soze and his operations.  All in all, a truly awesome film!  If you haven't seen it, you haven't lived, baby! Rating: 10/10",Null,0,1,16 January 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Amazing!
","Crouching Tiger rocked!  I've never seen such carefully planned out fighting sequences.  The cinematography was exceptional, the plot was mediocre, and the action was great.  The only area that could of used improvement was the story.  The whole plot seemed like a recycling of Akira Kurosawa's brainchildren; The Seven Samurai and such.  All in all, Crouching Tiger was still an excellent movie, and as a mass-market movie it was surprisingly smart and audacious. 8/10",Null,0,0,1 January 2001
Event Horizon," Great Movie? Well, I wouldn't go that Far
","Event Horizon wasn't that bad; I kind of liked it.  My problem is that the backstory about the ship had a better story than the plot of this movie.  I feel like the filmmakers and the studios think that the audience is dumber than a bag of hammers.  They figure that since our feeble brains can hardly add fractions, we don't understand anything complex.  So, they trade in an interesting story for a stupid action movie.  True, I'm not an experienced physicist, but I'd like science better than exploitation.  Seen it!  Who knows, by making more complicated films, we might be bemused by this plucky motion picture industry.  I could sense the irony in the physicist explaining the 'dimensional gateway' to a bunch of palookas who look more confused by this movie's premise than we do.

The Evil Dead," We've Dug Something Up for You!
","Welcome to the Crypt!  I'm kidding, of course.  This is Evil Dead, not that lame TV show.  This movie was absolutely terrifying!  There was a time in our history when America took pride in it's horror movies.  This film is the pinnacle of that time.  You have a scenario that rips off the premise from 'The Exorcist' and 'Night of the Living Dead', but still pulls it off exceptionally; a group of college kids go to a cabin in the middle of nowhere, and begin to murder each other.  As it happens, there happens to be an ancient spirit residing there.  Instead of a full-out assault, it doesn't kill them right away, but instead let's the kids linger.  This movie is intense, and it showed that Raimi was an irreverent talent.  If only Raimi's other films were so lucky.  'The Quick and the Dead' sucked, and 'Evil Dead 2' wasn't very funny, and was uncool.  However, 'Evil Dead' is Raimi's indie masterpiece.  It's extremely graphic, and there were times where I was watching the film and started to think, 'uh..Lunch-coming-up!'  If you can stand scenes of people being cut open and counting their rings, then you'll be fine.  I thought I would be a lot less scared by 'Evil Dead'.  I was pretty cool through it, but I still had bad dreams.  As far as killing people, it's pretty good.  This is the best of the 'Evil Dead' series, by far.  And, at least one of the cast members is a decent actor who'se done some good work.  I'm talking about Bruce Campbell.  Bruce did a lot of stuff; he worked with Lea Thompson on 'Caroline in the City', he was in Waxwork 2; he was the main character in Brisco County, Jr.  But 'Evil Dead' was the hallmark of Bruce's career.  Bruce can now be seen at L.A's prestigious Garden Street Mall, where he sells lightly salted meat products. In short, watch 'Evil Dead' for a real thrill ride.  I read in Fangoria about how Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi were at each others' throats, and that the entire three days of the shoot were absolute hell.

Mission: Impossible II," Awesome
","Mission Impossible 2 was incredible!  I've never seen such mind-blowing special effects in my life.  I'll be honest; the beginning exposition was incredibly slow-moving, but from that point on the film moves forward with lightning fast speed! 9/10 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",Null,0,0,30 December 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," Hot, Sweet, and Filthy!(Spoilers)
","'What kind of charade ends with someone turning up dead?'  Those are great lyrics, Nolan.  I've got real talent.  My lyrics?- Those are lines from the movie, idiot!  I couldn't even think of interesting enough phrases from my own imagination to use during my review.  Anyway, 'Eyes Wide Shut' was a great f****g movie!  When Kubrick makes a movie, they're supposed to be good; that's the whole point.  It was moving yet stupid.  The sets look like they were designed by Edward Hopper.  Tom Cruise is Bill Hartman, and he wonders where his seed will find purchase.  Maybe if Tom could tell himself who it is he's looking for, he could help himself.  The orgy scene, what a great scene!  That was actually how my parents met.  Oh, for fun.  Nicole Kidman- I hate to stare at a butt like that.  Sydney Pollack- you twisted old fruit.  Vinessa Shaw, in a cameo role- Now she really is hotter than Nicole.  My only critique to the actors would be-'posture, people- let's snap it up a bit!'  And, what was with the whimsical sitcom music? 'Fidelio'- let me get a pencil, I want to write that one down.  Hey, it's my favorite movie.  But, sure wish I had a girlfriend instead of this movie!

Titanic," Uh..You know...yeah..you know? Um-huh..
","I saw a dismal film ahead, when I first saw the opening credits, but it was still entertaining, and a little tragic.  In the typical James Cameron style, this film is just crawling with stuff you wouldn't believe.  The movie starts out dull, with Gloria Stuart helping to pad out the first ten minutes, but then it really gets rolling!  Afterwards, I had to ask myself: Hey, got a cigarette?  I felt spent, and that's typical of Cameron movies too.  If Cameron made a biblical film, I bet he'd have a twenty minute crucifixion scene.  The sinking was incredible, and they saved the best for last; the rest is just another day on board a Loveboat style rip-off.  Oh well, Cameron's not much without his special effects here, but that's what everyone who goes to see this movie already knows.  James Cameron should stop giving himself Orson Welles injections, and just stick to making action movies.  I just keep thinking of those slick effects in his other films, and how beautiful they all were.  This movie?  I guess James was just trying to display some emotion, but it was corny.  The sinking is what this movie's about. Rating: 7/10 (Bill Paxton must have been depressed about his part in the movie)",Null,2,3,27 May 2001
Army of Darkness," A Misunderstood Indie/ Cult Hit Phenom that Rocks!
","Army of Darkness plays out like a sick, existential nightmare of a tangled protagonist's web of inner demons, set up against the backdrop of a premise that all to gladly parodies itself in the name of good comedy; but backfires as the premise gets water thin; and the audience is left to wonder if horror movies have embraced laid back nostalgia as a substitute for sheer terror and dauntless tension.  As compared to Raimi's 'The Evil Dead', this film plays out like a sick and syrupy snow cone that's been allowed to sit out on a late summer afternoon, on a porch, for a little too long.  As a result, it is a nauseaus mess, at times.  I still enjoyed the symbiotic interplay of the characters, and the story and dialogue should keep any enlightened existentialist glued to their chair, and the movie runs at a breakneck pace, and brings back fond memories of fond times past, in a good-natured, devil-may care, David Lynch awe-inspiring way. Rating: 5/10 ( An unnecessary addition, it single-handedly brings down a metaphoric 'empire' that would have been better off left to the first two films-how tragic.)",Null,1,1,30 July 2001
Bram Stoker's Dracula," When Coppola Dabbles in Surreal Films
","Dracula was absolutely stunning, and I'm not just saying that because I'm on the payroll.  This film was so awesomely constructed, and that means lots of money.  Is there any genre that Coppola can't conquer?  I have some questions, though:  Why was Dracula sporting that grunge look from Seattle? It's quite popular, I've heard, but why in this movie?  Also, why did Vlad borrow his shades from John Lennon?  Aside from that, this film really kicked a**!  A new color scheme was introduced every five minutes, and the opening was spectacular.  I liked the flashback in the beginning better than the rest of the movie.  The pace was just right, and I felt like things were moving real fast towards the end of the film.  I thought Winona should have covered her cleavage, and her shame, but oh well.  Francis likes cleavage; go figure! Rating: 10/10 (MB-Massive Babeage)",Null,0,0,17 May 2001
Shrek," Only Has An Hour Or So To be Hilarious, and Fails
","Shrek was, well, not healthy for children and other living things.  From seeing this mind-numbing 'fairy tale', it's no wonder to me why our children are now dumber than a bag of hammers.  These so-called children's movies condescend the audience into a state of utter slothfulness, and our kids are left without a thought in their tiny little brains.  For once I'll be glad to re-read the Grimm Brothers; at least they entertained children with horrifying stories of violence, debauchery, and sadism.  The most terrifying part of Shrek is paying eight bucks to see it, and thinking to yourself 'I hate this film, everything about it is bad'.  Well, it all wasn't terrible, the computer graphics were great and, well, nevermind, it still bites the big one.  Full of meaningless pop culture references and mindless child manipulation tactics, expect your child to want to blow your money on worthless merchandise and clothing and God knows what else.  The jokes about bad breath and Freud?-hey, this is the Dark Ages; Continuity!  I was impressed by how primitive their eviction notices were in the Dark Ages.

True Romance," Pretty Cool!
","I enjoyed watching this film.  It's packed to the brim with all kinds of wild action sequences.  The language is profane, to say the least.  The best part of this film is the hyperkinetic filmmaking style from director Tony Scott.  This film reminded me of Top Gun, Scott's other awesome film.  The cast is one of the most incredible ones I've ever seen!  From mass-market stars like Christopher Walken and Christian Slater, to lesser knowns like Gary Oldman and Tom Sizemore, this film is so cool, that if it were any cooler, I'd have hypothermia!
