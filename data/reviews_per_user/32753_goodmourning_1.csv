Insidious: Chapter 2," Pure horrific gold.
","First off I am a huge James Wan fan, I love everything he has directed; Saw, Dead Silence, Death Sentence, Insidious, The Conjuring, and now Insidious: Chapter 2. He blows me away one film at a film. He truly is saving the modern mainstream horror industry. Insidious: Chapter 2 begins right where its predecessor ends, immediate thrill and immediate scares. This film answers all of the unanswered questions from the first; the thing is I didn't even realize that I HAD unanswered questions from the first. What I appreciate the most about both Insidious films is that James hates fake scares, when something is scraping at your window no it is not 'the wind' but it is exactly what your instincts tell you, something you should be running away from! His ghostly characters will literally sit on the couch for minutes at a time; they're so out there and so realistic, which is a rare find. The character development is astounding, we experience Patrick Wilson's character Josh go from loving family man to soulless and frightening evil in literal seconds. Even if you are not a fan of Insidious, I do suggest you still go see its sequel because it might just make you appreciate the first one a heck of a lot more. Insidious: Chapter 2 is pure unique cinematic horror gold.",9,1,3,27 September 2013
