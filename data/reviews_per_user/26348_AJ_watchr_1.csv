The Avengers," Awesome Movie....
",I was waiting for this movie for a long time..The movie was above my expectation..I am Very happy with the response in its opening day..Iron-man is my favorite super hero..Robert D Jr. is a very talented actor(everybody knows about it...:)..)But rest of the super heroes (specially HULK n Thor) are also good..Story line is good..The effects are awesome..Don't download pirated version because these guys works really hard to please viewers like us..This action packed movie is a complete family entertainer..Humor+Action+jaw breaking effects=awesome movie...In short 'If you miss this movie now then you are going to regret about it later...'..Watch it and rate it on IMDb..,9,7,16,27 April 2012
