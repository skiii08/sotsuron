3:10 to Yuma," 3:10 to Yuma: The Legend
","There's something very special about James Mangold's '3:10 to Yuma,' a prince among remakes. Looking back, it's possible to recognize this in the first few scenes of the film. A bandit gang plans to rob a stagecoach in the American Southwest of the late-1860s. The bandits mount-up, but not before we see one of them place a few fistfuls of dynamite into his saddlebags. Surprise-surprise, a few minutes later we're in for a treat: the first use of 'shoot the gas tank'-tactics in a Western. It's an unlikely occurrence, brought to us for pure enjoyment.And so it is, I suggest, with the entire film. Unlike the 1957 original, which tells it straight, this version tells it crooked. We're not watching how events actually transpired. No, we're watching how we *wished* they'd transpired. If you want the truth, then check out the 1957 version, herein lies '3:10 to Yuma: The Legend.'You should remember that when you first heard the 3:10 story you were lying asleep at night as a child with your older brother. He lit a match and told you of when it was 'your old man and Ben Wade to the station, when no one else would'",10,1,3,21 September 2007
No Country for Old Men," The 'Anti-Fargo'
","The Coen Brothers have created a number of films with followings. There's 'The Big Lebowski,' a redux of the 1940s detective thriller, and there's 'Barton Fink,' a tragedy about the nature of salaries. Each of their films, excluding that Clooney movie, is deservedly revered. 'Fargo' is my favorite. It's a thriller about the nature of being middle class, where the evils of the middle class created a crisis and the goodness of the middle class perseveres. Fargo's secret is that it follows characters that have souls.'No Country for Old Men' returns to the circumstances of 'Fargo' from a new perspective. This time the Coens ask us to forget about good and evil, and step into the mind of modernity incarnate, a person who is well aware that nothing matters.This is a trying experience. A man I respect saw this film before me and said, simply, 'It's cold.' Indeed. The contrasts the Coens draw with the pleasantly bad Steve Buscemi and the angelic Frances McDormand are stark and, I would guess, quite deliberate. Where there was redemption and humor, there is now emptiness. Fargo advises, 'Go. Live your life well.' No Country states, 'Flip some coins.' Whether we reference Harry Lime on the Ferris Wheel (lucasaq), Lt. Robert Hearn of 'The Naked and the Dead,' or whatever else out there that made you think there is nothing, this work is a fine addition to that canon.'No Country for Old Men' is about the darkness of existence. When you watch the film, remember the first few sequences. A dying man sits in a car begging for water. Another man sees him and walks away to tend to other things. Late that night, he awakens, remembering the thirsty man. He gets up, says goodbye to his wife, fills a milk jug with water, and goes to do the right thing. That was his only mistake. Right wrong, a main character might have quipped, I'm the guy with the gun.",10,2,8,10 December 2007
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Bold casting, Round Droids *Do* Matter!
","In the dark days of the late 1970's, when the original 'Star Wars' was cast and released, a different wind blew in the area of robot casting. C-3PO was played by a typical blonde-colored cyborg, whereas R2-D2's role went to the Oscar the Grouch's trash can wearing 'droid-face.' In these more enlightened times, J.J. Abrams flips the tables and continues his long trend of strong casting. Much like when he brought in a frat boy to play the camera holder Hud in 2008's 'Cloverfield,' Abrams's does the entire movie industry credit here by casting a Round Droid in the main role.The casting of BB-8 could have gone to a cyborg-like robot. It could have gone to a HAL-the-computer or 'Whopper'-like robot. Abrams and Disney *could* have stuck to middle of the road and taken no chances and cast Haley Joel Osment as BB-8.But instead, no, we have in 'The Force Awakens' a round-shaped robot playing BB-8. Even when, a few days from now, everyone forgets 'Awakens' and this movie becomes, rightfully, remembered as a nice re-introduction to the material that allowed Rian Johnson to make a great 'Star Wars' movie, we will have a round robot cast in a 'Star Wars' movie. And isn't that what all of this was about anyways?Great acknowledgement is due to J.J. Abrams. The casting was his boldest choice yet. Every time I flip on my TV, there's that round robot playing a droid in 'Star Wars.' It's ground-breaking. Combined with Disney's mastery of necromancy in returning Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, and Mark Hamill to the land of the living (and somehow reviving John Travolota's career), 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' is box office magic. And by magic I mean gold. Money. Piles of it. Stellar casting, even if, somehow, I feel a little nostalgic for the prequels and their fresh material.",4,7,15,18 December 2015
