Walk the Line," Extremely disappointing
","I don't know if there was something wrong with the DVD that I rented or if the sound for this film is just awful to begin with. I have heard much superior sound on old Three Stooges and Laurel and Hardy shorts. I couldn't understand half of his mumbling dialog - but that may have been for the best! To be accurate, though, the horrible sound in this movie about music was the least of the problems with it.The only bright spot for me was Reese Witherspoon's performance and that was illuminated only by the incredibly awful rest-of-the-movie! One thing this film did do for me was to verify what I had suspected all along - that Johnny Cash was no more than a self-serving, irresponsible, marginally talented, drug-addicted hack. I suppose that's to be expected in most high-end entertainers, but he displayed it in spades!! The character inspired no sympathetic feelings in me whatsoever. His many problems and trials were brought on by his own stupid, self destructive actions.Anyway, I returned the DVD & received credit for the rental price. To me, it was a total piece of junk!

War of the Worlds," Terrible
","What a total letdown! In my opinion, the only really good part was when the aliens finally got that mouthy brat! Too bad she and her moronic brother survived. And what about all that politically correct 'parenting' in the middle of the apparent destruction of mankind? Ridiculous! Completely unrealistic civilian crowd reactions during action scenes - running TOWARD the most violent confrontations etc. Absolute junk! This movie put me in mind of David Lynch's 'Dune'. Completely missed the opportunity to make an exceptional film, opting instead for a tedious piece of drivel! Tom Cruise seemed to be playing himself as he actually is - an ignorant, opinionated, untalented, white trash punk! Cordially, JP",1,21,41,23 November 2005
