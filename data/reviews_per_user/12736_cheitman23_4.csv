The Ring," Stop that, that's silly!!
","(Very mild spoilers)               Remember that classic Monty Python skit about the old women stealing babies? Mid-way through, a man in a British army officer uniform breaks in and stops the skit, Complaining that 'this was a perfectly good skit about stealing babies and then it got SILLY so next time hat happens I'm going to stop it.Right? RIGHT!'.              Something like that needed to happen in the last 20 minutes on The Ring. What started out as a perfectly good B horror movie got ridiculous. Not  the 'it's coming out of the TV' part (I apologize to those who genuinely were scared as horror is a very personal thing) or cheesy 'sucked dry' corpse, but  the sad 'answer' at the end that points out about 40 plot holes big enough to dive aMAC truck through (already listed by many others) What could have been anunsettling vague ending with a memorably creepy Surrealist B&W video(reminiscent of NIN 'Closer video) to haunt your dreams is spoiled by theimplausible explanation.          The film is undeniably well crafted and the acting is above 'B' quality, but many 'B' films have been more unsettling simply by witholding the answers and letting the visuals or atmosphere linger without Zombie Stalker horror orridiculous coicidences and plot devices.  Reference the original 'Phantasm','Blair Witch Project', 'Picnic at Hanging Rock' or 'Dead Ringers' for films with similarly implausible subject matter that are extremely effective by what they DON'T include. As stated above, horror is a personal experience and whatscares some may make other (me) laugh in the theatre despite my best efforts. A little subtlety at the denoument could have made this an eerily effective thriller instead of something that falls apart at the end.",4,7,16,9 June 2003
Eyes Wide Shut," Highly Conservative
","For a film that was advertised as the new 9 1/2 weeks, this is a very chilly film. The basic premise is that sex outside the sanctity of marriage will either kill or haunt you forever. There are some things to hate about this movie (that damned awful piano score) but also things to admire about it. If you feel this is Kubrick's worst movie, try sitting through Barry Lyndon. If Stanley was still alive I'd like to ask him what was up with Alan Cumming's character, was it supposed to be funny or just disturbing? I thought he was going to leap over the desk and kiss Cruise.Overall, this film was a little suspenseful and NOT SEXY AT ALL. And the ending of the story with Kidman's promise to Cruise almost came off more like a threat. Or a life sentence. Whatever grandpa Stanley says, sex is not THAT scary. Not that I've ever been to his Hellfire club.Out of four stars, 2 1/2. Interesting.",6,0,0,26 March 2001
Vanilla Sky," If you saw the original...
","...than this has to be a disappointment. I wish I could see it 'for the first time' again because Abre los Ojos was a masterpiece to me. Maybe I was SO deathly bored because I already knew what was going to happen? Also, please Mr Crowe, we know you love rock music but it's not a SUBSTITUTE for emotion. Please turn it dow, the old Monkees and Beach Boys makes this seem like a weak acid flick like Jack Nicholson's 'Psyche Out'.
	Penelope Cruz seemed like a much better actress with subtitles, the reading is so monotone. The Cameron Diaz character was better in the first film because there was less of a 'relationship' between her and David and she was less attractive. This makes her more dangerous, the more casual realtionship makes David more of a heel. Crowe, of course, would hesitate to make any main character less than likable, especially Tom Cruise, a fine actor who is miscast as he brings too much audience presupposition to this. The dialoge is TOO MUCH, as Crowe seems to want to add more meaning, more statements to a fine film that simply weigh it down. Unlike most foreign films, you cannot find Abre los Ojos boring or pretentious even if you hated it. Sadly, we can't say that this time around.** 1/2 as my expectations may be too high compared to the first film, but the soundtrack and banter are too much.",6,0,0,16 December 2001
Gladiator," Entertaining, but really.....
","After the Academy Awards, I have to temper my displeasure a bit. This was not a bad movie at all. It is quite good compared to, say, Demetrius and the Gladiators. But this has to be the most overrated movie to win Best Picture since Forrest Gump. Even more overrated than Titanic. Take one part Spartacus, one third Braveheart, and one third Caligula and blend. The female character is pure window dressing, the effects are poor but thankfully used sparingly.The period armour and weapons are all wrong. The tacked-on 'going home' racial liberation bit at the end is pure hokum. In it's defense, the film does have two very fine performances (rewarded) and some terrific action sequences.Still, I am sad that we could not have seen the award go to one of the more challenging and visionary films, Crouching Tiger or Traffic. Sometimes popcorn is just popcorn, even with heavy butter. ** 1/2 stars, seven out of ten.",7,0,0,26 March 2001
