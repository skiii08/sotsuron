Vertigo," IF you like classics
","This really is a great film. Story, characters, directing, music. Oh the music; this film would be far less without it.A detective with a weakness is called upon to help his buddy find out more about his wife. He starts to follow her, and falls in love, but he's being played. With so many reviews about this film, what else can be said, except a review of the reviews. Something I see a lot is people using the wrong yardstick. If you grew up on modern Hollywood and have the attention span of a 3-yr old, this will seem like a slow tedious film. However, if you have a taste for great film, you will understand why its rated so highly. Not only is the plot well written, but there are subtle things in the development of events, his wanting to bring her back, the process he goes through to figure it all out, and the horrible twist at the end.I wouldn't say this a favorite film of mine, but I can certainly agree that it is classic to watched and enjoyed as it slowly, yet entertainingly unravels.",9,3,8,31 December 2009
The English Patient," It'll tear your heart out
","Yes, this movie is a bit long, but how else could you tell a tale with such human characters, and so many crossroads. I've seen some reviews which say it's a bore, but this is not an action thriller, this is a movie that will move you and may bring you tears. The sadness is profound. Check the awards for this movie and you'll see that it got the credit it deserves...it is a modern masterpiece in the style of LOA, with the desert playing its role as both a beautiful backdrop and unforgiving harsh reality. The story is told as a revelation, jumping back and forth between the current time and the few years prior, a slow revelation as a lonely nurse finds her ability to love again, a vengeful spy learns to forgive, and a dying man learns acceptance and his final peace. This film is a good selection for 'settled' couples and married ones, and bring the tissues, for both women and men....it'll tear your heart out. Definitely worth watching if you appreciate great, profound, moving stories, but then again, if you do, you've probably already seen it.",10,1,4,16 October 2012
Insomnia," Almost the entire movie IS character development
","This is an excellent thriller, if you like to watch real movies. If so, you will be treated to real characters, real story, real drama. I can't add much to the review by Giancarlo, except that I think music could have played a more prominent more, but maybe in this case, 'less is more'. Pacino is excellent, the progression of his character through the movie is so real, you feel what he is going through. The meeting between him an William's is great stuff...'You don't get it. You're my job. You're about as mysterious to me as a block toilet is to a plumber. Reason for doing what you did? Who gives a f...'The supporting cast is excellent, especially Swank showing why she is now such renowned actress (this was after her first Oscar, but before her second) The only odd one is Williams, but it probably my prejudice against him because I grew up watching ever since he was Mork, so bad guy doesn't seem real. Nonetheless, he does it well enough, considering he's working out of his style and up against with two drama pros Pacino and Swank.There's no mystery, because we know who did it early on, the drama lies elsewhere, and it's a really good story.There's a lot of great scenes, just one great scene after another. I can pick up this movie at any point when it's on cable and watch it again. A very underrated movie, if you like drama you will be entertained.",9,3,5,29 September 2009
