Saturday Night Fever," A Film Critic's Favorite Movie
","Roger Ebert said that 'Saturday Night Fever,' was Gene Siskel's favorite movie.  While not my all-time favorite, it is definitely in my top fifty. It is not a mindless disco film, it is an intense character study that accurately captures the era.  If you have empathy for the plight of others, and enjoy powerful dramatic portrayals of flawed, real people coming of age in tough circumstances, then you will enjoy this movie.  John Travolta richly deserved the  Academy Award nomination he received for his portrayal of Tony Manero.",9,0,1,1 June 1999
