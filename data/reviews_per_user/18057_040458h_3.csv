Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good but not great.
","It's difficult to criticize The Phantom Menace without being biased by the fact that it is a Star Wars movie.  I definately walked into the theatre hoping for nothing less than the best movie of all time.  It was therefore unavoidable that I would be just a little dissapointed.As a stand-alone movie, TPM would be quite weak.  There isn't much character development, the plot is pretty thin, and the presence of Jar Jar Binks almost made me want to vomit.  But we have to remember that it is NOT a stand-alone film, it is the beginning of a series of six.  As such, it has a lot of ground work to lay for the upcoming sequels.Whatever its weaknesses, TPM is definately exciting.  The podrace and the duel with Darth Maul alone are worth the price of admission.  The CGI backgrounds are nothing short of breath-taking.  Industrial Light And Magic have given us the ultimate realization of George Lucas' vision.In short, amazing action sequences and beautiful cinematography and FX more than made up for the limp plot and feeble character development.  I gave The Phantom Menace an 8/10.",8,0,0,13 December 1999
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Ridiculous
","I first saw this film several months ago.  I was stunned by what I saw. How is it that such an awful movie came to be known as a classic?  What disgusted me most about it was the portrayal of the arrogant British officer (played by Alec Guiness) as an admirable and principled hero.  What makes him arrogant?  Trying to use laws to exclude him from working with the 'grunts'.  What made this even more ridiculous was that the soldiers still obeyed and respected him after his little protest.Another problem was the portrayal of the camp itself.  The film sugar coats the real-life consequences POW's face for insubordination (there was not a single beating or execution in the entire film).  I don't say this because I'm bloodthirsty, I say it because the lack of such violence trivializes the horrors of war.So in summing up, I watched Bridge On the River Kwai expecting something worthy of being called a classic.  What I got was a nearly farcical take on the war genre.  Excellent performances (who plays a pompous englishman better than Guiness?) could not save this movie from its unintentional silliness.",1,23,50,10 December 1999
Braveheart," One of the best movies ever...
","Braveheart is one of the greatest films ever made.  Mel Gibson shows off his talent both in front of and behind the camera, proving once and for all that he is one of the most talented men in film today.The scenery in this movie is pure eye-candy.  The rocky highlands of the British Isles provide a breathtaking back drop to a story of revenge, freedom, and love.  Set and costume design perfectly capture the essence of medieval Europe.  The supporting cast is absolutely delightful, from Wallace's lady loves and best friends to the hateful King of England.  The roles are all acted to perfection, making you genuinely care about the characters.My only real gripe is that the enemy (in this case the english) are not really portrayed as people.  This is perhaps for the best, however, given the large-scale slaughter William Wallace inflicts upon them.In summary, Braveheart is an absolute work of art.  Everything about it exudes perfection.  A perfect 10!",10,1,2,10 December 1999
