The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Great Movie
","The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of my all time favorite movies. I read the book before I watched the movie and absolutely loved it. When I read the book I felt a connection with Charlie, the main character. But the first time I watched the movie it was like meeting an old friend. Much of the characters personalities were the same which helped me feel more connected. I love the way this film was shot and the way the book was written, using letters to an anonymous person. I have heard many people say that this movie deals with serious topics in an insensitive way. I do not think that is the case. I see Charlie and other characters react to situations the same way I think I would. With that said, I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.",9,0,0,5 December 2013
