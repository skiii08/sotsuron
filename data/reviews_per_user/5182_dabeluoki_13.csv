Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Just A Boring Movie.
","Obi Wan is a boring character hero with zero depth.
Qui Gon is cool, but he also doesn't have a lot to him.
They have a a master student relationship, but the story never gave you reason to really care about them. So when Qui Gon dies you don't particularly care, however the fight with Darth maul that cause his death is the best Star Wars fight I have seen so far.
Jar Jar is a useless character that annoys a lot of fans however for me personally I could rarely hear what he was saying so I didn't particularly care.
Padme and Anakin are boring in this movie and you don't really care about them.
Anakin just up and leaving his mom makes no sense in my opinion. The pod race is fun though.
Stars war movies should be about good vs evil, dark vs light, it should not be about trade federations.
Palpatine is sort of lame.
Yod and the rest of the Jedi Council are very lame in this movie and the Jedi council not training Anakin is the stupidest crap ever. Because of fear they won't train him and he's too old. This due is like 7 and of course he's gonna be fearful in a room with a bunch of old men deciding his fate. It's very weird why they won't train him even though Qui Gon a Jedi Master believes he's the one of the prophecy. Regardless when the councils tell him no they won't accept him as a Jedi, he tells them to his face he will train Anakin anyway and the council doesn't do anything about it. I guess you can just ignore the Jedi council wishes without any consequences.
Midi-Chlorian is a stupid retcon in the series and instead of the force being a mystical force that binds all life together. It's weird cells in your body, and the more you have the stronger you are.
The Jedi face no real danger in this movie as the droids are so easily defeated every time which means the movie rarely has statues.
Movie would have flopped if it wasn't for it being Star Wars related.",6,0,1,22 February 2020
Spider-Man 2," Pretty Good
","Flaws with the movie are the villains, MJ and the ending. Alright so Doc Oc is a great character right before he becomes a villain. After he becomes a villain he is being controlled by the tentacle mechanical arms attached to his body which is the stupidest thing ever.
MJ astronaut boyfriend gets cucked so hard in these moves I mean...the girl he proposes doesn't love him at all. Yet she keeps leading him on and says yes to proposal only for her to leave on wedding day.Now the ending is the worst part of the movie if you ask me. Spider-Man half speech with Doc Oc...causes him to turn a new leaf in a span of a minutes and sacrifice himself to save the day....yup they kill of Spider-Man most iconic villain in one movie...
Not only that...MJ and Spider-Man getting together in the end is the stupidest hit ever. Spider-Man is the movie is constantly dealing with pitfalls cause of his secret work as Spider-Man. He loses his pizza job because he's always late doing Spider-Man jobs, failing doctor Connors class because again he's being a hero all the time. Doesn't have enough money to pay rent because he can't keep a stable job, his relationships with MJ is going down the toilet, etc. To the point where he ends up quitting being Spider-Man for a while and throwing away his costume, but has to comeback to save the day because the citizens and those he cares about will be in constant danger now that's he gone and crime is rising up. However....guess what In the end he gets with the girl he loves MJ because she doesn't care about how danger her relationship with Spider-Man is and I guess Peter Park stops caring to.Don't get me started on Norman Osborn entity talking to Harry in the end...",8,0,0,16 February 2020
Spider-Man 3," What Killed the Trilogy
","Spider-Man Character is what carries this movie.
The biggest problem with this movie are the villains, which each one of them could have worked it it were them solo as a villain.
Sandman is a villains with great potential and I think the retcon of him being Ben Parker killer was great. (Don't get me started on the beautiful scene Of Flint Mario becoming Sandman) His motivations for stealing to stop his daughter from dying is very touching. However with that said I did not like how even after admitting his wrong doing he seemingly just leaves off screen never to be heard of again. He should have turned himself in or something but nope he just gone. Maybe he not gonna commit crime anymore no way to say for sure.
Now Venom is a horrible villain in this story, Brock who is a good character until he turns into a villains. He basically gets caught plagiarism after Peter Parker Snitches on him and now wants Peter Parker dead. Even gets sandman to help try and kill him. However I will say his fight was pretty cool.
Harry Osborn character was fine in this movie however his amnesia in this movie, and his turn to the good side is so stupid. His butler basically tells him Spider-Man didn't kill Norman it's Norman himself who caused his death however it doesn't make sense why the butler took so long to tell him this information. I will say his death and his team up with Spider-Man in the end was great, although that first fight cgi was bad.
Now let's get to MJ...she's a thot she is mad that Peter kisses Gwen Stacy yet later in the movie she kisses Harry Osborn. Ffs they really didn't need relationship drama in this movie again. Although I do actual like how she is captured by venom in the end of the story as it's used to great affect. Giver Peter a reason to go ask Harry For Help. Well anyway I do feel like she was a little to mean to Peter in the 1st act of the movies . She signed up for this yet she's mad Peter always has to do Spider-Man Work.
Now I don't think I have mentioned her in any of the other reviews but Aunt May, JK Simmons, and his crew, and Uncle Ben are amazing characters.
Finally let's talk about Peter Parker, he is quite frankly a good character in these movies. You can really tell the fame is getting to his head. Which causes him to do a lot of stupid things all while going through a lot of personal stuff. Harry his best friend hates him, and his uncle killer is still on the lose. The First Movie was about doing what is right, the second movie was about with great power comes great responsibility, the third movie is about learning to forgive those who do you wrong.",7,0,0,22 February 2020
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Better than the Sam Raini Trilogy
","This movie is constantly making you laugh and arguably has a villains better than any of the Sam Raimi films. The twist with the vulture being the girl Peter likes dad is a cool twist. All the side characters are funny, and iron utilization in this film is great. Despite others wanting to see more Uncle Ben. Peter has a really iconic comic book moment in this movie and it's used to great affect him being buried underneath a bunch of rocks. Theme theme of learning to stand in your own two feet was good and all, however I will say this movie was a little too long for my taste, and drags out a bit in the end.",8,0,1,22 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The Worst Star Wars Movie.
","Finn has now become a sidekick. His only character is basically always concerned with what's Rey doing and he loves to scream it in this movie.
The knights of Ren were lame as hell and were never a real threat.
The First Order being General Hux is so obvious as he's the only First Order character we know by names that's still alive besides Ren and some knee General introduced this movie. His reasoning for being a spy is so terrible too it's because he hates Kylo Ren so much he is willing to betray the entire first order.This movie is basically a video game movie, there constantly going from planet to planet introducing new random characters we don't really get to know. Sure Lando was cool but the two other girls were introduced far too late for us to care about. I mean it's such a bad idea to introducing new characters the final movie, rather than focusing on the main ones.Poe is about the only main character I like in the end.
Leia dying out of know where was kind of lame and I frankly never cared about her in any of these movies.
Now let's talk about Rey Palpatine, it's such a terrible idea. What are the odds Finn and BB 8 happens to run into Palpatine Grandaughter on Jakku. For sake Rey is such an op Mary Sue it's unbelievable. Chewie does nothing in this movie, and has no meaningful interactions now that Han gone which kind of sucks. Back to Rey there literally no good reason for Rey to ever turn to the dark side....I don't know why there always teasing it. Kylo Ren becoming a a good guy is just a copy of Vader which is so uninspired, and very lame.
Palpatine should not be in this movie, bruh Vader killed him and the Disney Sequels are not cannon.",6,3,13,1 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Terrible Star Wars movie
","The Dialogue in this movie is terrible. 'I don't like sand, it's rough'-Anakin SkyWalker.
Padme and Anakin romance is handled poorly and you don't care about the falling in love.
Palpatine sends Count Dooku to kill Padme, Dooku sends Jango Fett to kill Padme. Jango gets sends a shapeshifter to kill Padme. The Shapeshifter sends killer worms to kill Padme. Yes you heard it..killer worms. This movie is terribly boring. Anakin Is a huge prick in this movie and he and Obi Wans are almost never on good terms. Obi Wan, Anakin, and Padme are again very boring in this movie. We are never told why exactly the separatists want to leave the Republic, all we know is that Palpatine is behind it all. Regardless this movie does have some highlights.
Anakin killing the all the Tsukin raiders including all of the wives and the children who caused the death of him mom. Is actually good for his character, and foreshadows his darkness in the next movie.
Jango Fett character is also pretty cool and the whole clone army situation being clones of him is all very cool.
Count Dooku cutting of Anakin arm was cool and Yoda coming in clutch and saving him and Obi Wan was very cool.
Palpatine is again lame in this movie , idk why George Lucas decided it for it to be Jar Jar binks of all people to be the one to elect Palpatine as new head chancellor.
Yeah this movie is just boring, will never watch again.",6,1,2,22 February 2020
Forrest Gump," The Greatest Movie of all time.
","Forrest Gump is a story that follows two characters, one names Forrest, the other named Jenna.
As  says Forrest Gump is a simple relatively wealthy kid man with a low I.Q, but good intentions. What makes this move so great is how Gump goes through many of the historical events of the 20th century. From dancing with Elvis, to entering the Vietnam war, to witnesses the original moon landing on tv, to meeting the black panther organization, and even even witnessing the WaterGate Scandal that causes Nixon to retire. Gump goes through a lot of situations throughout his life, but he never lets anyone of them disturb his happiness. From we're wearing braces on his leg, to get in bullied in school, and as an adult, to even being shot. Gump never gives up and continues to believe things will workout all right. That faith always helps him out for example when he gets his braces of he discovers he can run extremely fast, and long, all that running from bullies paid off (insert famous Run Forrest Run Here scene here). Not only that because he runs so fast Football recruiters and coaches notice him allowing him to receive a football scholarship to the university of Alabama as a running back. Which then allows him to graduate college and join the military when a recruiter talks to him. Why he joins the military no reasons he just does it no real explanation to why.
That's the thing with his character he basically symbolizes the idea that somebody can make a difference no matter who they are, even the dumbest of the dumb. When he joins the military, he quickly able to fit, you realize Forrest really isn't that dumb. He able to quickly able to reassemble his gun in the military, faster than anyone in the U.S military existence.
Anyway in the military he meets a man named Bubba and he comes the best of pals. Despite racism clearly being an issue as shown by the historical scene of the desegregation of the university of Alabama(extremely funny). Bubba and Him are quickly able to become the best of friends. To the point where the the Shrimp business he always talks with Forrest about, he eventually ask Forrest to come join him once's they leave the military. Which is sad cause Bubba ends up dying due to an injury.Anyway when he went to go save Lieutenant Dan his commander and a few other solid jets, Dan tells him to leave him, but Forrest doesn't listen. This causes Gump to become a war hero although Dan ends up losing his legs due to serious injuries. While in rehab Forrest Gump picks up a new skill as ping pong which allows him join the All America Ping Pong team and even meet JFK. He eventually meets lieutenant Dan again and the dude is a mess, he a hopeless goner since he couldn't die War like his ancestors. Although he joins Gump in his shrimping business challenges god to sink his ship when a huge hurricane hit's Louisian, and his ship is the only one that remains. Allowing Gump to monopolize the business and in the end they both become millionaires, as Dan takes over the business although he makes sure to replay Gump by making him a stock shared in Gump words a 'fruit company'(Apple). Dan eventually get married and finds a wife.
Anyway let's talk about Gump Mother she is an amazing single mother who only ever wanted the best for her child. To the point where she ends up having sex with a school principal early on in the move just so that her child could go to a better school. She always tells Gump 'life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get'. Basically mean life is unpredictable, it's full of surprises. You pick and piece of chocolate and you eat it, you may like it, but when you pick again you might not like the other one. Does that mean you stop eating from those boxes of chocolate no you keep eating a trying the next, who knows you may like the rest of them. When she dies of Cancer Later on in the story it's very sad.Now let's talk about Jenna her and Gump relationships. Jenna starts her life of being sexually abused by her father and that's a common theme in her life in away. Which Forrest Descirbes as 'always kissing and touching Jenny and her sisters'. The men in her life are constantly abusing her yet the one man who never even think about touching her, constantly rejects him. Jenny was originally Gumps only friend as everyone else treated him like the 'idiot' he was, she was the only one who let Gump sit with her on the bus on his first day at school. She was the one who told Gump to 'Run Forrest Run' from the bullies. Jenny ends up posing for a Playboy while in college and ends up getting expelled. Which causes her to perform and sing for a strip club pretty much nude. Anyway Forrest Gump doesn't like how the men grabbed her just like how he didn't like her boyfriend in college grabbing her and beats them up. Cussing Jenna to be fired, anyway before leaving for the military Jenny worried about the Vietnam war tells Forrest if he is ever scared in Vietnam to just run away. She still gives him advice even though he just got her fired meaning she probably didn't like the job anyway.
Forrest is constantly writing her letter in the Military, but is never getting any of them back, although they do end up uniting a few year later in Washington D.C, following a mostly muted Anti War Speech Gump was about to accidentally participate in. The two spend the day together and converge at a Black Panther Party sage house, however Jenny boyfriend at the time and the Party members weren't happy swing Forrest there. Jenny and her boyfriend eventually get in an argument in which the boyfriend slaps Jenny and Gump goes ballistic. Forres and Jenny are forced to leave and they spend the rest of the night reflecting on there journeys. Jenny ends up leaving for Berkeley's with the same boy that hit her, although not before Gump giver her his Congressional Medal of Honor reward, and saying she is her girl to which Jenny replies I'll always be your girl. Jenny ends going though a really rough time after this she has succumbed further into a life of drugs and instability. Battered and high she comes closed to committing suicide. Jenny eventually gets her life together and becomes a waitress and ends up meeting Gump, she has a child now who she named Forrest Jump Junior. We don't really know if it's really it's Gump kid or not but he accepts Gump Jr. as his own kid. We find out that Jenny is ill and suffering from an I own virus at the time know as HIV. Which prompts Forrest to tell them to come live with him and he promises to come take care of both of them. Jenny ask Forrest if he will marry her and he agree with great happiness. She ends up dying later on, and the saddest scene appear with Gump talking to her at her grave. Jenny finally accepted the one man that truly cared for her and she ends up dying. Sad, at least Gump jr is very bright. Forrest Gump is an amazing story and it's a must watch.",10,1,1,26 March 2020
Spider-Man," Spider-Man 2.
",Great Well Paced move with great characters. My only flaws with the movie is the villain and peter breaking the bro's before hoes code. I felt like Peter making out with MJ even though he knows she's dating is very out of character.....however maybe not so. Although fit did leave a distaste in my my mouth. Second flaw of the movie is the villain....I mean he has a nice persona and everything and his relationship with peter and Harry is great. However Norman Osborn and the Green Goblin basics being two different entities is the stupidest ever.,8,0,0,16 February 2020
Aliens," Accidently watched this one before the first! Still a great Movie
","Text: Alien is a story about of course Aliens and its a fantastic movie. The story centers around Warrant Officer Ellen Ripley a woman who was in hypersleep for 57 years. While I didn't know what happened she was seemingly on a mission once with crewmates who all end up dying due Aliens. Of course none of her bosses belive her and she ends up being demoted, they also belive she could have killed them. Ripley left her daughter behind to complete this mission, and like I said she was in hyper space, for 57 years so she was dead by the time she came back. Missing the 11th year old birthday party she said she will be there for.Now the real story happens when a distress signal encountered by Carter Burke from a terraforming colony, basically asking for help. Burke contacts Ripley to try to get her to go face the aliens just one last time, she accepts on one conditions. They would go there to save life and defeat the aliens, not use them as test subjects. Now here is where the meat of the story is...everything goes wrong. A group of Marines lets say 20 of them all go to this distant planet so see whatsups. Off course there cocky and none them believe aliens exactly aisst, they don't even respect RiIpley but suprise suprise, when they encounter the aliens most of them die.The only ones to surive are Corpoal Dwayne Hicks and private Hudson and Vasquez. Lets talk about these characters for a sec, Hudson was a bit of a nervous wreck. We first get too see how he like when they play the knife came and Hudson is scared out of his mind. We next see see him freak out and almost kill a little girl named Newt. Then throughout the show he is constantly freaking out say WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO, WERE ALL GONNA DIE. Although in the ends he mans up in the end and faces the Aliens head on, and dies like a chad.Next we got Vasquez who had a good bond with the rest of the crewmates making jokes and lauging with them. She especially had a good bond with a certain man named Drake who unfortunately got killed by the Aliens. She and Him were like jocks and didn't want to listen to the rules which costed them later. As there weapons they used were too dangerous to use, and despite lieutenant Gormon telling them its too risky. Blah blah She had the chance to save him, blah blah Gormon wouldn't let her because its too risky. Gormon knocked out for like the entire middle part of the move, comes back in the third acts. Gormon goes out of his way to try and save Vasquez blah blah they know they can't win. So they both press and explosive tirgger and killed themselves in order to buy the reamning guys time. Vasquez was mad and wanted to kick Gormon ass, but she dies with him.Captain Hicks is my favorite character in this movie, his whole crews die but the dude just keeps his head up the entire move. He acts maturely and its no wonder he is a captain, his bond with Ripley was sweet and when he told Ripley his named was Dwayne Ripley and Ripley saying her name is Ellen I wanted them to get together, as typically cowerker call each other by there last name, but friends do not. Thank god he doesn't die.Lets talk about Bishop he is an android, now Ripley had a bad experience with an andriod once as situatuion happen causing the death of some of her commrades. So she ends up insulting him, and the common trend of this movie happens here. Hudsons is a coward dies like a badass. Vasquez causes the death of her teammates, dies saving her teammates. Gordon nervous wreck who can't say simple directions and could have potentially saved more lifes, confidently goes out to save Vasquez and keeps a level head the entire time. Bishop ends up saving the day when he manages to get a spaceship to fly them out of the planent, although he aint realizes the Queen Aliens ended up on top, really and earns the respect of Ripley, when she belived he could be a potential threat.Now lets talk about Carter Blurke, he is your typically villain in the story who cares more about money than the people. We find out that he was the one that sent that terraforming colony to the Alien places, and didn't warn about the potential creatures there. Now while I hate him and his death made me smile, he is a great addition to this story due to the tension he causes. There a very line that hits deep where Ripley says I don't know who is worse, humans or aliens because atleast aliens don't to to kill one another. Anyway we find our Blurke is some sick fuck who tried to get his crew and a little girl all to be implanted with Alien eggs inside of him. So that went they go home he could become some scientific millionaire and be set for life. He gets caugh and he doesn't learn his lesson as again now tries to kill his crew so he won't be imprisoned or killed for basically his attempted murder. He ends up getting killed by one of the Aliens when he could have surived.Now lets talk about Ripley and her relationship with Newt. Riplay lost her family and her daughter. Newt lost her family and her mother. Ripley finds the little girl and eventually givers her hope. Newt was so hopeless that even after the armed marines found her she though she we be better off alone, she had no plans to get off that terrible place. Anyway Ripley and Newt bond throughout the movie cultivating in my favorite scene. Badass Ripley defeated the mother alien by fighting her in a mech and blasting it off into space (yes you heard that right). She starts of miserable with no hope, to becoming hopeful and smiling as when she gets captured by one of the aliens to become a spawn. Ripley ends up coming to save her and she says 'I knew you would come'. Ripley is the most badass female main character I have ever scene in the movie. I mean the way she just goes against and faces off the Mother Alien alone is so fucking cool. The way she escapes is fucking cool too she is way more braver than I am. This move isn't a ten just because the beggining scence wasn't as interesting as when they finally meet the Aliens, but still this is a good movie and a must watch.
Summary: A Great Action/Horror Movie",9,0,0,22 April 2020
Coco," A solid movie with nice twist
","This is a good movie however I do have my flaws with it, but we will get into that later. This movie follows a kid named miguel who is in love with music, however his family hates it, especially his grandmother. Now this cause a drift/ tension between Miguel and his other family members. So on his own he sneaks around pllaying music even though music of any kind is banned in his family. Well one day based of the guitar he has in his family photo he believes Ernesto de la cruz his idol and music legend is his father and after stealing his character from his sanctuary he transported to the world of the dead. Now in order to get back home he needs to receive a blessing from one of his dead family members before the raise or death awaits him.
Now lets talk about some of the characters. Miguel is a generic character who wants to do what he believes in, but unfortunately his family won't let him. Nothing special, but works for this movie.
Now Abuelita the grandmother on the other hand is such an annoying character. Its to unrealistic for her to hate music so much to the point she dictates the entire family to stop listiening or playing music all together.
Ernesto de la cruz is a cool character on the other hand, and the quite frankly the usual disney twist villain really worked here. Although I will say how we find out he actually killed Miguel real great great grandfather Hector was so stupid. He basically admitted it in a moive lol.
Imelda who is miguel great great grandmother is an arlgiht character. She hates Hectpr because he frankly did abandon his family to pursue his music dreams, which is completely understandable. Although still banning all music is kind of dumb. Regardless I really like how she cares for miguel and they are family and she really does want im to get back home. Although she wants all music of his to be banned is very stupid and I very much dislike how she basically in love with Hector again even if she finds out the truth. At the end of the day Hector still left his family alone with no means to make money until Imelda eventually started a shoe buisness.
Now lets talk about the best character in the show Hector. The dude just doesn't want to be forgotten by his daugher coco in the living world because when your forgotten in the day of the dead I guess that means you cease to exist. Anyway his personality was great, he goes from being some immature  con artist to a likeable kind man. Although I would have preferred if you know maybe he was a bad as family made him out to be and for him to had been forgotten, I understand this is a kids movie. So in all honesty the twist with him actually had wanted to comeback to his family, but Ernesto food poisoned him was still great and I'm glad he gets the due credit he deserves for all songs he wrote that Ernesto took credit for. Now the callback with how Ernesto gets a bell falling on him in the dead word which is the exact way on how he died in the living world was nice. Although him being forgotten didn't make the mose sense to me....like what only a year past since he was defamed and your tellining no one remembers him anymore.",8,0,0,7 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," An Average Movie
","Rey is still not a compelling character in this movie.
She is a boring character who frankly they keep trying to tempt her to the dark side when she literally has no good reason to go to the dark side. Every man she meets she looks at a father figure and I'm just like....bruh you said less than 100 words to them you got problems.
Poe actually had a good arc in this film, you don't always have to go in guns blazing sometimes there are other options. However it is very idiotic for that purple hair lady not to tell the crew the plan....so as far as I'm concerned the Poe turning on them made sense.
So tell me why Luke tries to kill his nephew because he sends a whole lot of dark in him, but won't kill his father who is a mass murderer. Is it because he sensed good in his father, but none is Kylo. Yet Rey Does Sense Good in kylo. Anyway that force connection Kylo and Rey Had was actually good addition to the story. Luke final battle with Kylo was good, but the way his character ended up very much dissatisfied me.
Kylo is a good character in my eyes. You very much see him struggling with the light side all the way until the end. A very telling scene was when he had the chance to kill Leia, with his spaceship, but chickened out. His interactions with Rey were great and anytime he is in film the movie is cool. He wants the past to die and a new world to begin.
Finn. Alright didn't like Finn all that much in the first movie, and the second movie I still don't. I don't know why he is so concerned about Rey in this movie. First thing he does when he wakes up is say 'Where's Rey'.
Rose is also a lame sidekick character who doesn't need to be in this movie. 'We win by not fighting the ones we hate, but saving the ones we love' is the most cheesiest line ever. Kanto Bite Island is very boring and nothing exciting happens here.",7,3,13,29 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Only Good Prequel Movie
","Finally Obi Wan and Anakin are cool characters. The first act of the movie is awesome as Anakin character is finally great. He really wants to save those around him on the way to saving Palpatine, but knows the mission comes first. Obi Wan and Anakin are actually friends in this movie and have a real bond. Anakin killing Count Dooku was very chilling and is part of the reason what makes Palpatine in this movie so great. The way he can manipulate people and just get under there skin so so satisfying to watch.
General Grievous is cool, and so is order 66, the killing of all the Jedi. Although I wish we had gotten to see General grievous capture Palpatine.
Every scene with Palpatine is great in this movie. 'Have you ever heard the tale of Darth Plaguesis the wise'-Palpatine.
Padme and Anakin relationship in this movie is amazing and all there scenes together were amazing. I just with how the way they got together wasn't so terrible. Every single character is at there best here, Yoda, Mace Windu, are both great in this movie. In fact I only have two flaws with this movie. First Anakin turn to dark side wasn't realistic. I mean because he wants to save his wife he ends up killing young Jedi children. Palpatine manipulations over him should have happened over the course of all three movies, however it's just this movie where we really get to see him be manipulated Padme dying of a broken heart is stupid and should have just died due to child birth.",8,0,0,22 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Rey is a Mary Sue, A new hope but worse.
","Movie starts of great with Finn realizes the terror of the first order after his friend dies and they kill a bunch of innocent people. And Poe being a cool han solo type character who finn needs to get off the space shuttle fo the first order. There dynamic with one another is amazing, the problem is as soon as the reach Jakku, Poe is booted out the movie until the third act, to make place for Rey. Rey is mary sue ans legitamately has no real flaws at all. She does anything right and behaves like the perfect angel. She cries over han solo death after only saying less than 100 words to him, yet in that time she thought of him as a father. Rey mary sue archetype is first shwon when some buyer wants to buy a droid she just meet for a lot of money, and her beeing a poor teenage says no. I think the scene would be much more interesting if she had said yes. Overall I just think shes is a pretty boring character and the force skills she uses in this movie makes her to op, her beating kylo ren was garbage. Han solo and kylo ren were great in this movie. Han giving up on his rightoues way, going back to pre New Hope Han due to his son going to the dark sides. Then there kylo ren who we don't know why he turned to the dark side, but is so cool. Hes struggling with the light side a little bit, and acts like his age. His fight was Rey and FInn were great, and his last words with his father were good too. 'I know whats the right thing to do, but I don't know if I have the strength to do it'.' I do wish Han Solo got to meet luke again though..:(
This movie is basically a new hope but worse.
Captured Resistance member gets interrogated by sith user.
Jedi living on some desert planent, and has no biological parents.
Wanted man has some interactions with said Jedi.
Resistance all work together to deestory death star in one final swoop.",8,2,12,28 February 2020
