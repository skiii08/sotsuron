Requiem for a Dream," Best Movie of 2000
","Erin Brokovich?  Traffic?  Cast Away?  Please.  The problem with movies like Gladiator, Cast Away and the like with getting recognized at awards shows isn't in the fact that they are the 'best' movies but that they are the ones most have seen.  If the same could be said of 'Requiem for a Dream', audiences would say that this was the most deserved film for at least direction and actress if not best picture as well.I love Julia Roberts and am happy she finally won an Oscar but she pales in comparison to Ellen Burstyn's performance here.  Furthermore, let me say that while Ellen not only deserved to win but that her three co-stars deserved nominations.  First, Jared Leto was amazing and has never shown such range in acting (but to his credit he has never had the script to work with either); Wayans is someone that I could do without normally but here he takes a despicable character and actually makes him very human and sympathetic (that is great acting); and finally Connolly is amazing and definitely deserving of a best supporting actress nod for her wicked turn as the good girlfriend gone bad.The only downside to this movie is that it revels in the despair and never shows any signs of coming out of the depths of hell, but that is the wonderment of the movie.  The fact that we are submersed in doom and gloom and still find these characters intriguing and sympathetic tells me that this is a powerful story.  Furthermore, it is amazing to me that Aronofsky was able to do the direction he did and go totally unnoticed by everyone! Shame!Best movie of 2000 without a doubt.  Sorry Billy Elliot.  You have my number two vote though.",10,0,0,15 May 2001
Memento," Best Movie of 2001 (Thus Far)
","Incredible, riveting and powerful.  What else could I say?  This movie has all of the qualities of classic film noir as well as the magnitude of an original, unique concept that has been tried and tired before but works here.  Guy Pearce has been underrated for years (just think back now to Priscilla and can you believe this is the same guy) and finally might get the recognition here that was at least well-deserved of him back for LA Confidential.  Powerful perfomances, well developed story with suspensful buildup of what our main character pieces together little by little makes this a must see.Easily in my top 100 of all time.",10,202,291,15 May 2001
The Godfather," Film Perfection
","When a person asks the question, 'What is your favorite movie?' I hesitate to answer because it has almost become cliche to name Francis Ford Coppola's epic, 'The Godfather.'  However, to name any other film would be a grave injustice to the majestic perfection that is indeed captured in these three hours of artistic achievement.  Instead of referring to the cliche without explanation, I am quick to point out that which makes this film deserving of such accolades:1.  Screenplay--Basically the essence of the film rests in the adaptation of Mario Puzo's best selling work of the same name.  Dialogue, scene dissection, etc. all are what truly makes the foundation of the film. 
2.  Acting--How can you go wrong when you have Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and on and on?  The names spill off the credits with wonderment.  Of course, keep in mind these names were not the household names of the day (albeit Brando's) but to look back thirty years ago and see these masters of their craft all working together, it is easy to see the dynamics of the acting and how it automatically makes the script look like a cakewalk to perform.3.  Direction/Technical Quality--cinematography, editing, sound and the direction of Coppola himself makes this film as 'tight' as it can be in the timeframe devoted to the first chapter in the saga.  In sum, 1,000 words cannot even begin to spell out why 'The Godfather' is my favorite film.  All I can say is that from the first frame until the final, you are left wanting more.  You are satisfied with the character development, the story line but even after three hours, you only become hungry for much, much more.  Thankfully, you can find that 'more' in the second installment.",Null,0,2,3 April 2003
