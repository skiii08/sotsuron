Walk the Line," Great music, great actors.
","I am not a country music fan. I am not a Johnny Cash fan. I am not a Joaquin Phoenix or Reese Witherspoon fan. But I do like this movie very much. The drive a musician has, the pain the loss of a beloved causes, the thrill the love of your life gives you, the difficulties between parents and children. It is all shown in a great performance by great actors. Without being pathetic or cheap melodramatic. I liked the growing of Johnny Cash as a performer. From a young boy who likes to listen to music to someone who tries to write his own songs, starts to play them for himself alone, with others, for small audiences and for enormous crowds. I enjoyed the music and have respect for the performances given in this movie. Not only by Phoenix and Witherspoon but also by other actors. A great movie, worth of being rewarded by Oscars!",9,2,4,3 March 2006
