The Rock," A Great Original Plot
","The Rock is a great film which is cast perfectly. It stars Nic Cage(con air) in the lead role and Sean Connery(entrapment) as his untrustworthy partner. Also in on the show are Ed Harris(state of grace) as the bad guy with a conscience and Dave Morse(the negotiator) as his loyal friend. Michael Biehn(navy seals) and William Forsythe also appear as the guys trying to stop Harris and his terrorists which includes Tony Todd(candyman).The story is great-Harris is an ex soldier who feels that the widows of soldiers that died in Vietnam and The Gulf were lied to so he captures The Alcatraz Prison(now a tourist attraction) and demands recognition for the soldiers and, of course, money, or he will destroy San Francisco.All the leads give grand performances and the characters are, for a change, three dimensional.

Antz," Inspiring Animation
","This is not just a movie more kids. I watched this with caution, and was prepared to be disappointed, but the Woody Allen one liners and the Christopher Walken slyness was incredible. At times, I'll admit, the most fun was guessing whose voice belonged to who. With a cast consisting of Allen, Walken, Sharon Stone, Sly Stallone, Gene Hackman, Jennifer Lopez, Dan Ackroyd, Danny Glover, Anne Bancroft and John Mahoney, it was sure to be a great film that can be enjoyed by adults and children alike. The best character for me was Colonel Cutter(walken) who added a certain conscience to the bad guy ants, led by Hackman. I recommend this to an easily entertained movie goer as I guarantee, you won't be disappointed. Rating=5/5",Null,0,0,29 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Huge Disappointment
","George Lucas should be credited highly for such a huge success with the Star Wars saga. Then again, his latest installment is an overrated hyped up movie that is nothing compared to other summer hits like Cruel Intentions and Austin Powers. With two more Star Wars film coming up, I think that Lucas should concentrate on smart dialogue and clever scripting, instead of fancy make up and special effects. Having said that, The Phantom Menace reaches Lucas' given goals to please youngsters. I understand that this film was a huge hit with young people, and that is what Lucas was aiming for. The special effects are good, and once again proves Lucas' talents. Ewen McGregor puts up a poor performance, given the extent of the role he plays. Jake Lloyd also disappoints as the young Anakin Skywalker. Liam Neeson is adequate in a role that he favours playing-the experienced elder. Credit should go to the supporting characters that gives it a life line-Natalie Portman, Samuel L Jackson, Terrence Stamp, Pernilla August and Amhed Best are all the better actors in this prequel.

Fight Club," Over Rated But Watchable
","Brad Pitt and David Fincher must be laughing right now. Together they have created two of Hollywood's most dangerous, yet brilliant films-Seven and now Fight Club. The story circles around a businessman suffering from insomnia and hating his job. He finds life joyless and meaningless until he meets Tyler Durden (Pitt). Together they start a franchise of discontent young men who find meaning in life by beating each other. Now this is a worthy storyline for a film that offers two great performances from Pitt and Mr Controversy himself, Edward Norton (American History X). However, as the film continues we are no longer with harmless men beating each other for fun, we are thrust into a sorry whirlpool of terrorist action and this is when the film loses its grip. They start to destroy buildings and threaten innocent civilians with guns. This is not the clever film making that we have seen earlier in the film. I would warn you that Fight Club is not Snow White, some of the violence is over the top. For instance Norton beating Angel Face (Jared Leto) into a bloody pulp is almost unwatchable.  Fight Club has some very funny moments especially the scenes where the Clubber's mission is to start a fight and lose with a member of the public, but some of this movie is just violence and a chance for lots of blood and gore. Helen Bonham Carter and Meat Loaf co star. Rating 3/5",Null,1,3,1 June 2000
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Racist, With Few Funny Moments
","South Park the Series is excellent. The characters are funny. The stories are exciting, and Matt Stone and Trey Parker provide memorable voices. Which is a shame really,when a decent series is made into a crap film like this.There are many racist moments in this. For example, using black men as shields in the army is not funny, and totally outrageous. The whole thing is also directed against Canadians. Now, I'm not Canadian, but I'm pretty sure they would take offense at this. I'm also not black, and I do take offense at this!However, South Park:Bigger, Longer, Uncut, is saved by what made the series good. The writers have struck gold with the use of George Clooney and his scene with Kenny. 'I'm sorry, but we accidentally replaced your heart with a baked potato, you have about three seconds to live!' This is the only one liner that is extremely funny. If I had to pick out slightly funny moments then they would be the scenes with Saddam Hussain in Hell. This too, is bound to upset someone, but it didn't really upset me that much.If you never watched a South Park episode, and you want a taster, then don't go and watch this movie. This film is not an indication of how funny South Park actually is. Watch a few of the episodes first to see if its your type of comedy, because watching this can 'frail your fragile lil' mind!'

The Fifth Element," Too Long
","Bruce Willis and Gary Oldman star in this action packed sci fi thriller about a mysterious Fifth Element(milla jovovich) who drops to Earth and into Willis' taxi. The film is scripted well and contains plenty of laughs. Gary Oldman is brilliant as the bad guy, whose conquest is to find the four elements. Willis is excellent as Corben Dallas, a taxi driver who has the unlucky job of saving the world. Co stars include Ian Holm, Chris Tucker and Luke Perry. Holm doesn't exactly give a career best, but still manages to keep up with the other leads. Tucker's annoying voice does well in Rush Hour and Jackie Brown, but after ongoing screams, he gets intolerable. The main flaw in The Fifth Element is the slowness. The ending is brilliant, its the best bit in the whole film. Its the introduction that takes the longest. The first ten minutes is the time to fast forward through. Rating=3/5",Null,0,1,18 August 1999
10 Things I Hate About You," A Fairly Decent Film
","A cast of up and coming actors and actresses including Larissa Oleynik and Julia Stiles(both 18) star in this twisted high school romantic comedy. Joseph Gordon Levitt is the real star. He steals every scene with his squeaky voice. Heath Ledger is dodgy. Some scenes, he shines, and in others, his Australian heritage is obvious. Both of the girls do well. Oleynik is great as the 'girlie girl' whilst Stiles is equally as good as the more rebellious sis. Daryll Mitchell is also good as the quick tempered English teacher.  Despite its beauty, 10 Things also managed to annoy me-the erotic novelist guidance teacher who disappears after half an hour, the Shakesperian student who appears, as if from nowhere, half way through the film. Still, 10 Things I Hate About You is a nice easy film to watch with pleasant enough performances. Rating=3/5",Null,0,0,17 August 1999
Predator," Arnie's Best Film Ever
","Although being one of Hollywood's greatest action heros, Arnold Swartzeneggar, has hardly ever been in an intelligent film in his life. With the exception of Predator. The other well known stars in this film are Bill Duke(director-Hoodlums) as Mac, Carl Weathers(Rocky), Jesse Ventura(Demolition Man) and Sonny Landham(Lock Up). A team of specialists are sent to the forests to rescue hostages but are soon the ones in need of help when they discover that some sort of alien is killing them one by one. Arnie does well, but the film lacks a bit when he is left to kill the alien on his own. Bill Duke, however, is the best character in this though, adding personality to an action film. What I also love about this film is the little habits that each of the men had. Ventura likes chewing, Duke likes shaving and Landham likes looking scary and saying lines like 'We're all gonna die, all of us'. It is a shame that a weaker sequel lets down what could have been a great series. I'm looking forward to the third installment though. Rating=3/5",Null,0,1,17 August 1999
LÃ©on: The Professional," Gary Oldman Is Absolutely Incredible
","Few British actors make it big in America-Anthony Hopkins, Guy Pearce, Tim Roth, Kate Winslet, Ben Chaplin, Jude Law, Chris Eccleston and Gary Oldman. Oldman is a brilliant actor who has the ability to play any character. He is superb at playing good guys;Joe Orton in Prick Up Your Ears, The Reverand In The Scarlet Letter(An underrated film),Jackie Flannery in State Of Grace and Jack in Romeo Is Bleeding. He is even better at playing bad guys;Dracula in Bram Stokers, Drexl in True Romance, Zorg in Fifth Element and Ivan in Air Force One. He goes one better in this amazing film about a lonely hitman, Leon(Jean Reno-Godzilla) and his relationship with a twelve year old girl(Natalie Portman-Star Wars). Oldman plays Norman Stansfield, a maniac cop who slaughters the family of Portman, and immediately becomes the enemy of Leon. All the cast give brilliant performances but Oldman is the best. He executes the lines with acute accuracy. The story is also good. Reno and Portman are both superb in starring roles and support comes from Danny Aiello. Rating=5/5",Null,0,2,13 August 1999
Armageddon," Easy entertainment
","With an all star cast including Ben Affleck(Good Will Hunting) Liv Tyler(Empire Records), Steve Buscemi(Pulp Fiction) Michael Clarke Duncan(The Green Mile), Will Patton(The Postman), Billy Bob Thornton(U Turn),Owen Wilson(Anaconda) and Bruce Willis(The Jackal), it was destined to be a huge success. And in my eyes, it was. The acting was fine;Liv Tyler and Steve Buscemi were excellent, and the story was brilliant. Whilst Deep Impact relied too much on special effects, Armageddon did not. Patton's relationship with his son and ex wife is deeply saddening. Affleck and Tyler were believable, even with Willis breathing down their necks constantly. Buscemi added the humour side as always,'This is so much fun,it's freaky,' He says with a huge, cheesy grin on his face. Bruce Willis is often getting 'stick' from critics-His temporary separation from wife, Demi Moore has caused more fuss then needed. Willis' last two films(Armageddon,The Jackal) have been crushed by critics. Are we forgetting that this is the man than brought us Pulp Fiction and The Die Hard series? And to top off Willis' problems, his restaurant in Los Angeles has became subject to bomb scares. Armageddon is a fun film with much entertainment, which is really all I look for in a movie. Rating=4/5",Null,1,1,25 July 1999
American Psycho," This movie is the pits
","I really don't care about all this talk at the moment about controversial movies. 'Violence is Sin' etc etc. Its all been done before. American Psycho merely takes it a step forward. Why this movie is such a big hit is beyond me. Christian Bale is good, he always was in movies like A Midsummer Night's Dream and All The Little Animals but one actor can not hold up an entire movie and despite the cast-Reese Witherspoon in a worthless role, Willem Dafoe in an equally inconclusive role and Chloe Sevigny as Patrick Bateman's secretary-the plot is nowhere.  It ends like a child's fantasy 'And little Patrick wakes up to find its all a dream' and the gore is so over the top (is it meant to be satirical?), even Jared Leto who is currently on the Hollywood A List after The Thin Red Line and Fight Club offers no sincerity whatsoever. Bateman's obsession with forgotten artists only works in the scene with Leto's Paul, after that becomes tiresome. American Psycho doesn't know where to start or end. I haven't read the book so I don't know whether this is the fault of the author or Mary Harron the director but it has no beginning, no end, no character development and the little humour it has comes and goes as quickly as some of the characters. It may be a hit in America and the Uk but to me this was a waste of valuable actors and time. Rating = 2/5",Null,1,2,31 May 2000
Face_Off," Action at it's best
","Face/Off is an incredible movie. There is nothing worse than an action film without a plot-fortunately, Face/Off had the greatest story of 1997. Neither John Travolta(Broken Arrow) nor Nic Cage(Con Air) had to worry too much about acting as the audience is satisfied enough with the amazing stunts and explosions.Travolta plays a cop who is 'slightly annoyed' when his son is shot dead in his arms by ruthless terrorist Cage. After years of tracking him down, Travolta manages to under go surgical treatment that allows him to pass through Cage's world, which includes lover Gina Gershon(Bound) and brother Alessandro Nivola(Best Laid Plans). Unfortunately Cage also has the treatment that allows him to go through Travolta's life, including wife Joan Allen and daughter Dominique Swain(Lolita). Now all evidence that both are not who they say they are is destroyed and both have to battle for their old lives back. Both leads enjoy a cruise through an incredible movie experience. Both have recently been voted 'cool' by EMPIRE magazine for the making of this film, which will be remembered for years to come. Rating=4/5",Null,0,1,25 July 1999
Aliens," James Cameron at his best
","One of the only sequels in movie history to beat the first by a lot. Its scarier, the acting is better and the direction will never be beaten. With a cast consisting of Sigourney Weaver, Micheal Biehn, Paul Reiser,Lance Henrikson and Bill Paxton, it was sure to be a winner. Paxton stands out as the best, managing to bring a lot of humour to a film  that needs it. The first Alien was very slow, Aliens 3 was poor and Alien Resurrection was not as good as this film which will always be remembered as one of the greatest films ever made. Rating=5/5",Null,0,1,23 June 1999
American History X," Incredible with astounding performances.
","Edward Norton is such an under rated actor, it hurts. His performances in this and Primal Fear are scary and believable. I don't know why he has only been in about eight films. His co star Edward Furlong is also great. I knew that I recognised him when I was watching History X, but only afterwards realised he was John Conner from Terminator 2. The film also includes stars like Avery Brooks(the big hit), Elliot Gould(bugsy), Jennifer Lien(star trek) and TV star Stacy Keach. Each one putting in a truly testing performance. The story is a little predictable, and at times delivers really horrific scenes, but I suppose that was needed to get the point across about Neo Nazi's. I recommend American History X for anyone who loves dramas, and those who can take a lot of violence. Rating=4/5",Null,0,0,23 October 1999
Pearl Harbor," An Incredible Mix of Romance, Action, Thrills and Scares
","Pearl Harbor boasts a tremendous cast including leads Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsdale. All three performances are  brilliant, especially young Hartnett whose previous screen outings (The Faculty, Halloween H20) have hardly required any serious acting ability!   The supporting acts include Jon Voight as President Roosevelt, Alec Baldwin as General Doolittle, Cuba Gooding Jnr, Tom Sizemore, William Fichtner, Dan Akroyd and Ewen Bremner. Each one offers a career best, Bremner even beats his early performance as Spud in Trainspotting. Director Michael Bay offers a film that stirs the emotions deeply and leaves the audience feeling dry, overpowered and angry at the American government for their ignorance at this time. The closing scene is probably one of the saddest I have seen in film history (baring in mind my age is 17)Although overlong and sometimes possibly drenched in American heroism, the film is a worthy experience and definately one I would recommend to all. Rating = 4/5",Null,0,0,17 July 2001
Saving Private Ryan," Unmissible
","Tom Hanks(big) heads a great cast in a voyage that takes the audience back to a time of despair. The whole cast give superb performances-Tom Sizemore(heat),Ed Burns(she's the one)Matt Damon(good will hunting)and jeremy davies(twister) are tremendous in a tear jerking film that breaks the hardest of hearts. This film will be remembered for the opening battle on Omagh Beach in which we were slaughtered terribly. However, I can't help thinking that the rental experience would be quite as good as the surround sound cinema. Still, it is a great film with superb performances. Rating=5/5",10,2,4,16 June 1999
JFK," Adequate, But Not Memorable
","Kevin Costner stars in an all star cast including Sissy Spacek and Gary Oldman(as Lee Harvey Oswald). Although, it is interesting, it is not one of those films that spring to mind straight away. The story is well known. John F Kennedy was a young US president who was supposedly assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald. This film dictates more than that to it's audience, and manages to do it well. Although I consider Costner to be a wooden actor(robin hood-was that meant to be an english accent?), he does well in this documentary style thriller. Rating=3/5",Null,2,13,28 August 1999
Donnie Brasco," Incredible Film
","Al Pacino and Johnny Depp star in this amazing mob film based around an undercover FBI agent, Joseph Pistone(depp) who infiltrated the mafia, but became very close with one of its members(pacino). Sturdy support comes from Michael Madsen(reservoir dogs), James Russo(under oath) and The Basketball Diaries paedophile Swifty, Bruno Kirby. It was written by the real Joseph Pistone, and involves it's audience with extreme ease. Pacino gives a performance worthy of his Godfather days. Depp is much better in this than in the other film of his I watched on that night, Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas. If you are interested in Gangster/Underworld films, then watch this film. Rating=4/5Other gangster films that I recommend are: Carlitos Way(Pacino, Penn, Leguizamo) State Of Grace(Penn, Oldman, Harris) At Close Range(Penn, Penn, Walken) Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead(Garcia, Buscemi)Reservoir Dogs(Keitel, Roth, Buscemi) Jackie Brown(Jackson, Grier, De Niro)The Godfather Series(Pacino, Caan, Garcia) Goodfellas(De Niro, Liotta, Pesci) Casino(De Niro, Stone, Pesci) True Romance(Slater, Arquette, Oldman)Payback(Gibson, Krissoferson, Coburn) Pulp Fiction(Willis, Rhames, Travolta)Above The Rim(Wayans, Shakur, Martin) The Getaway(Baldwin, Madsen, Basinger) LA Confidential(Pearce, Spacey, De Vito) The Usual Suspects(Spacey, Baldwin, Posthelwaite) Leon(Reno, Portman, Oldman) Fargo(Buscemi, Storman, Macy) and oh, of course, Mickey Blue Eyes(Caan, Grant, Viterelli).

","So once again, funny man Jim Carrey (Peggie Sue Got Married) returns to bring laughter to his audiences worldwide. His partner, Jeff Daniels(Speed), is also in on the show.If you are a person who loves quick humour, then you will love this film. It probably won't appeal to adults, but for kids aged ten to eighteen, then you will find this extremely good. I highly recommend this. Rating=4/5",Null,0,0,15 August 1999
From Dusk Till Dawn," This Mush Spawned Two Sequels?
","Being a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino, I was expecting yet again a masterpiece. For the first half an hour or so, I was pleasantly surprised. (I wasn't aware of the plot so I was sure it was about two brothers on the run from the cops)As soon as Salma Hayek's dance had finished, myself and my younger brother could only watch, jaws wide open, as hundreds of vampires started to appear from nowhere. From then onwards, the film was absolutely terrible. It was so over the top, it was unbelievable. I couldn't understand how anyone could find it entertaining.(my best friend recommended it!) I felt so sorry for George Clooney(One Fine Day), Harvey Keitel(Resevoir Dogs), Juliette Lewis(The Basketball Diaries), Tarantino(Full Tilt Boogie), Salma Hayek(The Faculty) and Danny Trejo(Desperado-one of the best actors in the world) who starred in it, and Robert Rodriguez(The Faculty) who directed it. Please, if you have any common sense, you will not watch this. I still can't get over the fact that this poor attempt had two sequels. Rating=1/5",Null,0,0,15 August 1999
Men in Black," Will V Alien Dudes-ROUND 2
","So after the average Independance Day, Will Smith returns yet again to kick some alien ass and do it with style. Well that was the aim. Unfortunately, Mr.Smith once again signs on to a film that goes nowhere what so ever. His co star Tommy Lee Jones(Volcano) does well to keep up with his active partner but after watching the film, I was left with the question-what was it all about? The answer was nothing really. The duo were faced with the task of tracking down an illegal alien-bug-thing before it wreaks havoc on our unaware planet. Both leads do fairly well considering the nowhere plot, and support comes from Rip Torn and Linda Florentino. The special effects are decent enough but nothing we haven't seen before. In summary, the actors did well in a flawed story. Rating=3/5",Null,0,0,27 July 1999
Reservoir Dogs," Written And Performed Brilliantly
","Michael Madsen(free willy), Tim Roth(pulp fiction), Harvey Keitel(co producer), Chris Penn(at close range), Steve Buscemi(things to do in denver when you're dead) Lawrence Bender(co producer) and Quentin Tarantino(producer, director, writer) star in this violent epic which sets a standard in modern filming. The story is fairly basic. A class of thieves plan to rob a bank. When they attempt, the police are aware, which leaves them with the conclusion that someone tipped the police off. Buscemi gives a career best(which is hard to do considering his near flawless career) as Mr Pink. Roth, Madsen and Penn also do well and deserve recognition for their performances. Some of the scenes are magic. The torture of a cop where Madsen gives a terrific sequence, the end scene where they all get suspicious of one another and the opening scene where we are introduced through a midway conversation about famous entertainers. Tarantino, in my eyes, is the best director in Hollywood. I really hope he decides to take the Rocky 6 film he has been offered. Rating=5/5",Null,1,3,27 August 1999
Pulp Fiction," Typical Tarantino
","An excellent twist of hip, funny stories, Pulp Fiction casts a lot of Tarantino's favourite actors-Samuel L Jackson(True Romance, Jackie Brown), Tim Roth(Resevoir Dogs), Harvey Keitel(From Dusk Till Dawn, Resevoir Dogs), Steve Buscemi(Desperado, Resevoir Dogs) and even Tarantino himself. John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman and Ving Rhames are also in on the action. This film is excellent in many ways. The dialogue is snappy and sharp, the acting is brilliant and the story is so clever. Basically, the whole story is based around a crime boss(Rhames) and his mysterious brief case. We start off the film with Mr Roth and his partner robbing a diner, and from that moment on, the audience can sit back and stare in amazement at the talent shown on screen. All the stars give a career best. There are superb confrontations between the actors-Mr Rhames and Mr Willis, Mr Jackson and Mr Roth, Mr Willis and Mr Travolta, Mr Travolta and Ms.Thurman, Mr Keitel and Mr Tarantino and Mr Jackson and Mr Travolta. It leaves the audience wondering who knows who and for what reason. Its the exact intelligence that made Jackie Brown so tremendous. Rating=5/5",Null,0,0,13 August 1999
Titanic," So the ship sinks;so what?
","My initial thoughts when first sitting down to watch Titanic at the cinema were,'So we already know the ending, so how good can it be?'Well, after the first ten minutes of crap, the true story unfolds and the story of Rose(Kate Winslet) and Jack(Leonardo Di Caprio) is told.Titanic has an all star cast including the afore mentioned doomed lovers, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates(Misery), Bill Paxton(A Simple Plan) and Jonathon Hyde(Anaconda). Each of the cast puts in a near perfect performance, and the story is surprisingly good. Both Winslet and Di Caprio deserved more recognition for their stunning performances as did James Cameron for his brilliant direction.On a whole, the film was an excellent version of the Titanic tragedy. It was later proven that Leo's character, Jack Dawson was actually on the Titanic. Rating=4/5",Null,2,5,27 July 1999
The Godfather: Part III," An Inspiring Film
","This film is often shadowed by the other two classics, Part 1 and 2, but this movie is, in its own right, an amazing film with incredible performances by Al Pacino and Andy Garcia in particular. Francis Ford Coppola directs this underrated film with family member Sofia putting in a worthy performance as Mary, daughter of Pacino and lover/cousin of Garcia. Having watched all three, I have to say this is the one that hits me the most. The other two were fine, but they were too cheery. The end two scenes of Part 3 are both touching, and memorable. The one flaw about this great film is the inconclusive end to Sonny Corleone's(James Caan) son Vinnie(Garcia). We neither see whether he lives or not. He disappears near the end with no indication about what happens to him. Despite this one flaw, Part 3 is a superb conclusion to one of Hollywood's greatest trilogies. But with talk of Leonardo Di Caprio taking on a prequel, I think Ford Coppola should quit while he is ahead. The Godfather Series has made stars of James Caan(Godfather Part 1), Andy Garcia(Part 3), Sofia Coppola(Parts 1,2,3), John Savage(Part 3), Robert DuVall(Parts 1,2), Joe Mategna(Part 3) and, of course, Al Pacino(Parts 1,2,3). They will never be forgotten by all who have watched any of them. Rating=5/5",Null,8,17,5 September 1999
Die Hard," A Great Action Film
","Bruce Willis stars as John McClane. A cop who has to fight back when the building he is staying at is taken by terrorists led by Hans Gruber(alan rickman). The action is great and is rated highly by most film goers. The direction is accurate and catches the magic on screen. Willis' lines are few but clever. Die Hard had two sequels. The first one was a fairly average action film but Die Hard With A Vengeance had the excellent combination of Samuel L Jackson as Zeus and Willis. Die Hard will never be forgotten as the best action film, ever! Rating=5/5",Null,0,0,18 August 1999
Scream 2," Hmmm....
","The biggest mistake that Kevin Williamson ever made was to get rid of the characters that made Scream so brilliant. Neither Stu(Matt Lillard), Billy(Skeet Ulrich) nor Tatty(Rose McGowan) are in Scream 2. Sidney(Neve Campbell) and Gale(Courteney Cox) are tiresome and uninteresting. The newcomers-Timothy Olyphant, Duane Martin, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jade Pickett, Omar Epps, Rebecca Gayheart, Jerry O Connell, Elise Neal and Josh Jackson are only slightly better. So we're left with Randy(Jamie Kennedy), Dwight(Dave Arquette) and Cotton(Liev Scrieber) to light up the screen with flashes of genius and quick wit. Which thankfully, they do... The coffee house scene where Randy and Dwight try to narrow down the possible suspects is incredibly good and the scene where Randy plays the killer at his own game with a mobile phone is executed well by Kennedy and directed brilliantly by Wes Craven. The end scene where the killer/s expose themselves to sidney is done well(except the killer/s themselves don't have very big parts). In summary, Scream 2 could have been superb(like the original) but for lack of interesting characters, it is not. Saved only by 'The Boys' Kennedy, Schreiber and Arquette. Rating=3/5. P.S.It could just be my eyes playing tricks on me but does Rose McGowan appear in the pictures at the start? I'm pretty sure its her!",Null,0,0,15 August 1999
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Slow But Effective Addition To The Myth
","Gary Oldman is amazing as Dracula. Not the sort of Dracula we usually see in Vampire movies, this time he is romantic and loving. His loved one is no less than Winona Ryder(aliens four). Anthony Hopkins is the experienced vampire hunter who, with the help of Richard E Grant, among others, tracks down dracula. The big let down though, is Keanu Reeves, in his worst screen appearance in his life(that includes Bill And Ted). His accent is drained and obviously not real. Hopkins, Oldman and Grant are great. Real British class acting, but are let down by Ryder on some occasions, and Reeves. I would recommend this film to lovers of Horror, but people should be warned about violent parts of the film.

Con Air," Nicolas Cage can not be bettered
","In the last few years, Cage has proven his ability to act the action hero. Playing the main guy in The Rock and playing opposite John Travolta in Face/off, he has managed to bring more to an action film. In this film, he plays released con Cameron Poe who is aboard a prison plane taken over by killer Cirus Grisham(john malkovich). Cage does his best to be noticed but frankly, Malkovich wins hands down! Excellent support by Monica Potter(patch adams) John Cusack(money for nothing) Ving Rhames(out of sight) Dave Chappelle(woo) Danny Trejo(heat) and Steve Buscemi(fargo).

Scream," big breasted girls going up the stairs,instead of out the front door...NOT!
","Scream is the type of movie that defies the rules of the genre. To start with, the main victim Sidney Prescott(neve campbell) is not your typical big breasted blonde who runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door. As she points out in the film. Also, Sidneys friend, Randy(played with perfection by jamie kennedy) is not your typical bicep sports player. This movie is scary, funny, sexy and is the most imitated film since Norman Bates in Psycho. Also stars Skeet Ulrich(touch) Rose McGowan(the doom generation) Courteney Cox(ace ventura) David Arquette(never been kissed) Matthew Lillard(dead man's curve) Drew Barrymore(gun crazy) and Henry Winkler(happy days).

Final Destination," Great Fun, pity about the ending
","Again we are thrust into another horror about unlucky teenagers facing certain death, but this time around its great fun. Is it better than Scream? To tell the truth I'm not sure, but Final Destination boasts a cast of extreme talent from movie virgin Devon Sawa, Dawson's Creek's unsure homosexual Kerr Smith, House On Haunted Hill's Ali Larter, American Pie's bully Sean William Scott to horror legend Tony Todd (Last seen impaled in The Rock).The story is original. A class of students are on their way to France when one student Alex Browning (Sawa) has a vision of the plane exploding. Him and six others are removed from the plane and sure enough the plane explodes. Each of them now has to fight for his or her life as death visits them one by one.The plot is twisty and if it wasn't for a rushed ending, Final Destination would be a killer. Sawa, and indeed the rest of the cast are incredible, offering a whole new level to the horror genre. Rating > 4/5",Null,1,1,31 May 2000
The Matrix," Whats All The Hype About?
","O.K, The Matrix is a good movie with great special effects and superb acting. So? The story isn't that good. I don't even think that the writers knew what they were writing about until it came for them to write it! Keanu Reeves and Larry Fishburne star in this sci fi action about 'a chosen one' (ooh, original!) who is faced with the task of fighting a group of immortals who have created this blindfolded world called Earth. Its just a creation to throw mankind of guard, and blind them to the truth. Well, all that aside, there were only a few decent moments in the whole film that were nail biting. They were mostly all at the start where Reeves didn't know the truth, and at the end, when he did. The middle of the film was confusing, and hardly entertaining at all. Carrie Anne Moss produces the most thrills. Her athletic escape from the Federal looking bad guys at the start was very well done. The Matrix got better reviews that it should have done. Its the type of movie that some love, and some aren't sure about. Rating=3/5",Null,0,0,29 August 1999
Heat," This could have been a good movie
","Every element is here- De Niro and Pacino locked in battle with extras like Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Natalie Portman, Hank Azaria, Danny Trejo, Ashley Judd, Wes Studi etc etc... Bottom line is that it has one of the best casts of the decade. Well, this is not enough to hold the film up. The romantic side of the characters is shameful. The film just touches upon the action and focuses more on the characters rivalry. Pacinos part may well have been given to an amateur. De Niro is only slightly better! Having said this, Kilmer is superb, as is Voight and Sizemore. The coffee shop scene works magically as a anti-climax and the final battle is brilliant. The most emotional character is the much hated Waingro(kevin gage). Appeals to some more than others.Rating=3/5",Null,0,0,16 June 1999
True Romance," Absolutely breathtaking
","Tarantino writes the best movie of all time. Christian Slater(robin hood)and Patricia Arquette(nightwatch) are the greatest screen couple ever. Gary Oldman(air force one,leon,) is the superb baddie with an excellent support cast including Dennis Hopper(speed) Christopher Walken(nick of time)James Gandolfini(the juror) Chris Penn(reservoir dogs) Tom Sizemore(enemy of the state,lock up) and Brad Pitt(meet joe black). Snappy dialogue including Mr.Hopper Vs Mr.Walken on Sicilian History and Mr.Oldman Vs Mr.Slater on breasts. Superb confrontations including Mr.Gandolfini Vs Ms.Arquette with a toilet seat and the final shoot out between the cops and the baddies in which our heroes are thrust in the middle of it. My favourite movie of all time. Rating=5/5",Null,2,5,16 June 1999
Goodfellas," 'What, am I here to F***ing amuse you?'-Pesci
","Every line is memorable as the next, as snappy as the last, Goodfellas brings a treat to fans of almost every genre. Joe Pesci(Home Alone) is the real star alongside Robert De Niro(Ronin) and Ray Liotta(who frankly lets the movie down). Martin Scorcesse directs an almost perfect movie and a landmark in filming history. The story centers around Ray Liotta and his entrance into the life of a wise guy. From a young man picking up employer's cars to a fully blown gangster. Him and his wife, Karen(Lorraine Bracco) start the marriage well;life couldn't be better, but before long they're addicted to drugs and on the run from cops. Some up and coming actors used the movie as a stepping stone into a successful star. You might remember a younger Samuel L Jackson in a very short-but welcome-part. In summary, the film is well cast, scripted successfully, and brilliantly acted out. Rating=5/5",Null,0,0,25 July 1999
The Birds," Amazing
","I am only fifteen years old, and I found this film to be incredible. Alfred Hitchcock should not only be remembered for his classics like Psycho, but also this this film that can only be described as....amazing! The start, I'll admit, is very slow. It takes a while for the whole story to get going, but once it does, the camera angles capture the birds in a unique way. This film was not so much scary, more creepy. The timing is so precise in every Hitchcock film. The audience is more scared by waiting for something to happen, than when it actually does. Rating=4/5P.S. Does Hitchcock cameo at the start, when the man with the two dogs leaves the building, just before the lead female enters?",Null,1,1,25 August 1999
The Godfather," Its No Wonder Why This Made Two Sequels
","This is a visual epic with grand performances from the entire cast. Marlon Brando's 'Banana Mouth Trick' is one of the most imitated characters in movie history. Also, its stars Robert DuVall, James Caan and Al Pacino in oscar winning roles. Francis Ford Coppola directs, with relative Sofia putting in an uncredited performance. The acting is solid, the story is brilliant, and the direction is superb. Although this is true, I actually preferred the second sequel. This is probably because of Andy Garcia's incredible performance as Vinnie Corleone. The Godfather Trilogy is Hollywood's greatest films. Do not miss any of them. They are true gems.
