United 93," Just watch the movie and shut up!!
","Over the years of using IMDb, this is the the first time I have commented on a film. Most users that hate films and comment on them seem to be losers in my opinion. Too much gore, not enough gore, too many stars, not any stars and so on. You saw the movie, live with it.As far as this movie is concerned, critiques from members of other countries don't hold squat. This movie has more of an impact on Americans film goers. Hand helds enhanced the quality of the film. I think the camera shaking added realism. Not using well known actors was a good idea. This was not an action film, but it was not intended to be one. The scenes in the atc rooms seemed real enough for me. As for the conspiracy theorists, get a life!!",8,3,6,11 June 2007
