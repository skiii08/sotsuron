The King's Speech," Heart warming movie
","This movie was excellent. I really enjoyed that it has some historical accuracy. Obviously it is a movie, and will not be 100% accurate, but what history it was based on made the movie that much better.I really enjoyed being able to watch as the King overcame his struggle of public speaking, and stuttering. It follows his life, from a young prince and his first encounter of public speech, all the way to coronation day, and a little farther. The movie is filled with comedy, and we are able to laugh at the Prince's obvious in ability to speak clearly. It is truly a heart warming movie.I highly recommend it! Everybody should watch this movie at least once, I have personally seen it 3 times.",9,0,1,8 May 2014
