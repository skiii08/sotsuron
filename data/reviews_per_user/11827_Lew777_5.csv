Blade Runner 2049," It kept me hooked
","After Ridley Scott's original cinematic stunner, this doesn't disappoint. It's cinematic view of life on earth is big , bold, bleak and beautiful. The story is a slow burner, but it kept me hooked right to the end. All performances were extremely good, with Ryan Gosling showing a vulnerable side to a robotic android. Harrison Ford too, showed a depth of emotion we so rarely see from him in his other films. All in all a visual stunner which was worth waiting for.",8,1,6,9 July 2018
About Time," I don't like watching this film ......
","....because each time I watch it, I' I'm a blubbering wreck totally immersed in the belief of love ,kindness and wanting to make the world a better place. Richard Curtis really GETS people , with their ordinaryness, flaws and capacity to love. He draws rich characterisation from the story of Tim following the male family footsteps of Time Travel. You'd think it a preposterous storyline but it's given great heart and sentiment. All the actors are wonderful but a special mention for the understated joy of Bill Nighy as Tim's dad . Their relationship has me in tears each time I watch. There's plenty of laughs too as Tim attempts to woo Mary ! In my book this is Richard Curtis's finest hour ! A must see .",9,3,4,14 August 2019
Toy Story 4," This is just a money-maker
","It's a shame this movie got made as the end of Toy Story 3 was a perfect ending to the trilogy, heartfelt & meaningful. This film, whilst a reasonably good film, really detracts from the sentiment the Toy Story films had built up - that the toys were there for their children. This film is really Woody - The Movie dressed up as a sequel to Toy Story 3. It's superfluous and is a capital attempt to milk the cash cow from this franchise, which it'll do very well with, I'm sure. Shame - but in due time, this will be the forgotten film while Toy Story 1-3 will be remembered fondly. Don't plan a Toy Story 5 to movie this story forward - it just isn't worth it anymore.",6,3,4,28 October 2019
Aladdin," Not as bad as many reviewers say, but not as good as it should be
","I can't believe the number of low scoring reviews for this film. It had the feel of a big budget film, had great camerawork, had extravagant costumes and colours and Will Smith as the genie. The roles of Aladdin and Jasmine were good too and the songs, whilst not as great as the animated film, were pretty solid. It's not a classic, ( there again neither was the remake of Beauty & The Beast), but it delivers a very good film for all audiences.
I do agree with the reviewers that the character of Jafar wasn't as pantomime-evil as he should have been. He was a bit underwhelming but it didn't detract extensively from enjoying this film. The studios must have been relatively happy with Guy Ritchie's direction, as it's made over $1bn dollars worldwide already on a $183m budget.",6,0,1,2 October 2019
The Proposal," Predictable..........and yet.........
","For me it was better than expected. The star of the show , however , must be Betty White, who had the funniest lines and the kookiest looks as the grandma who is celebrating her 90th Birthday. It's really a film of 2 halves - the first & most interesting one where Sandra Bullock, a domineering & disliked Canadian senior publisher, is being deported back to Canada for flouting US Immigration laws. She hits on the plan to wed her assistant, Ryan Reynolds to allow her to remain & for him to keep his job. They have to convince the Immigration authorities they are a genuine couple in love & need to fly to Alaska to celebrate Ryan's Grandma's birthday & announce their engagement. This all works well, with snappy dialogue and good interplay from the couple. The second half falls into line with numerous other rom-coms, where they reveal more of themselves and get locked into other family issues.
Overall, it works pretty well & Sandra Bullock & Ryan Reynolds show adept abilities in a comedic role. They are ably supported by Mary Steenburgen & especially Betty White who I can't say enough good things about. See the film just for her performance alone !",7,0,0,31 August 2018
