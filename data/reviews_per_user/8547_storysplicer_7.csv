Walk the Line," A pulse-pounder on all levels
","Excellent performances, a heartbreaking and inspiring love story, and a chance to finally see Reese really shine. The best parts are the scenes on the road with Elvis and Jerry Lee. And it's nice to see a regional film shot on location in the real places that does not condescend to southern accents or culture. It gets a bit repetitive, maudlin and dirge-like as Johnny's ache for June wears on, and the film's examination of Cash's drug-addled, room-wrecking clich√© of a superstar life don't go beyond your average 'Behind the Music' episode. It's kind of sick how we celebrate the antics of self-destructive misfits instead of trying to get them some help, but at least Cash fell in love with a woman who was not an enabler. She saved his life.",7,1,3,25 November 2005
Suicide Squad," Not as bad as I thought it would be
","The draw for me to see this movie was Margot Robbie. I really enjoyed her performance in 'The Wolf of Wall Street.' In addition to her obvious physical attributes, she was funny, smart and engaging in that film. In 'Suicide Squad,' her posterior gets about the same amount of screen time as her face. Not that this is a bad thing from an aesthetic point of view, but her Harley Quinn was not nearly as dominant a presence as I was led to believe from the trailer and the press coverage. So I felt shortchanged. Other than that, Will Smith and Jay Hernandez really made the film for me. They overcame their typecasting to bring depth and humanity to their characters. I liked the film's take on trying to make 'bad' people sympathetic by showing how they got that way. Otherwise, this movie was just plain weird. Its gritty realism was totally at odds with the more fantastical elements; it seemed to have a split personality.",5,1,2,12 August 2016
Capote," Pristine, note-perfect minimalistic film-making
","I normally steer clear of films that reek of Oscar, but this turned out to be far more than a parlor trick by the able impersonator Hoffman. He and the movie plumb the very depths of America's dark soul. We learn how high a price Capote paid for his persistence in hunting down the story of this infamous Midwestern massacre, and how far he went to see his masterpiece through. Every performance deserves an award, the technical aspects are beyond reproach, the storytelling and script are clear as a bell without an unnecessary moment. But most breathtaking of all is the way Hoffman portrays Capote's unshakable faith in his own genius.",10,0,0,25 November 2005
Pride & Prejudice," See this one with a date
","Reimagined as a chick flick for today's romance-starved independent women, this paean to the days when marriage was both a means of financial security and the only sanctioned way to get your freak on bursts with fecundity and virility. A naughty shot of a well-endowed hog sets the lusty tone; the disquiet of adolescent hormones pulses through every frame. Dame Judi Dench is the only showstopper in terms of acting, but the other performances are serviceable. Keira Knightley looks most beautiful and sympathetic in repose; she already has a few too many tics for such a young thespian, but that makes no nevermind when you've been anointed as the Next Big British Thing. The lush cinematography serves as a travelogue for the great houses (and champion trees) of Britain.",5,1,4,25 November 2005
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," The same-old same-old
","I guess it's too late to replace Daniel Radcliffe, but from the beginning he was never a compelling on screen presence, and that's a shame. The owlish Harry Potter deserves an edge Ratcliffe simply does not possess. So, every Potter movie including this one seems to have involved spinning some very expensive plates to distract us from this fact. Here are the best special effects money can buy (the Quidditch match is the set piece and is the most satisfying), some rather disconcerting sexual innuendo about Harry's belongings in a bath house, Ralph Fiennes as the evil version of the English Patient (wow, that must have hurt his nose), and the dawning realization that purely through an accident of birth, Harry Potter will prevail over every evil that befalls him. For some reason I find this depressing rather than inspiring. It must go back to my proud American notion that you are not born into greatness, you much create it. Whereas in England, you're stuck for life.",6,0,0,25 November 2005
The Departed," thanks for nothing
","This is a big thumb in the eye from New York to Boston. The fact that Boston actors participated in such a cavalier, irresponsible glorification of violence that perpetuates negative stereotypes about the city and its people is surprising. The real story Scorcese should have brought to the screen is why there are more than 70 unsolved homicides in the city and why the police get so little cooperation from public. Why it took so long to finish this movie is the real mystery, not the intrigues going on in the bumbling police department. The one redeeming thing is Jack Nicholson's performance. No one else in the movie comes close to his genius. He owns the screen.",4,1,4,21 October 2006
Honey," A pleasant surprise
","I stumbled on this while channel-surfing and was pleasantly surprised. Many positive messages tucked in to an appealing story acted out by a surpassingly attractive cast: Be true to yourself; follow your dream (but don't sell out); love your neighbor, stay loyal to your friends, your family, and your 'hood. It reminded me of when I saw Krush Groove as a teen and it gave me a window into a whole other world. Except now hip hop is the dominant pop culture and not exotic anymore. But we still rarely get to see positive characters of color with their emotional depth fully explored. Lil Romeo gives an especially nuanced performance.",5,5,9,24 February 2005
