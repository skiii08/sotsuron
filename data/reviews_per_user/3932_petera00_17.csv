Requiem for a Dream," great flick but only one that arnofsky is getting started on
","I'd have to admit that this film was great, but I could only watch it once because it doesn't have the script that Pi had, which I admit is two times better than that of Requiem.  I thought the shots were like poetry, some of the best artistic values I have seen in years.I cannot wait for Arnofsky to sign on with the next batman, he should return the darknight into what it was originally when another great director Tim Burton did the original one.  Requiem makes you think about what life is like when you take drugs and the downfalls it can hold when you do them. This is great because he explores the entire world of drugs and the effects of them.Arnofsky, Kubrick, and Burton are some of the best directors of all time, they are the true artists at work.  I think by the time Arnofsky is done, you'll compare him to that of Orson Wells.  (at least he doesn't copy images and scenes like every other movie director).  I enjoyed it, great movie. And if it were to go into the oscars, it would ruin the movie.  I hate hollywood and all there big hollywood blockbusters, noooooooo good.  Keep it a secret and don't let them change your movie they want it to be Darren. Peace out",Null,0,3,12 July 2001
Spartacus," Hollywood epics at their worst.
","Wow if you won't let Kubrick do anything on the set, then what are you doing on the set?  Definately a corrupted film from start to finish, but give it credit, it sure did use a big cast.  I really think this was Kubricks worst, and boy do I mean worst film ever.  It's just sad when you can't let a man with one of the best and most powerful imaginations do what he wants to the movie.  Ohhhhh well at least it was original (more than I could say about Gladiator) and it used a very large cast.",Null,0,5,4 February 2002
Hereditary," Wayyyy overhyped and done by a person who does not respect the horror genre at all
","Ok... This wasnt a bad movie... But you literally have to break this movie up in 2 parts. The first act is pure drama. It's about a family who is grieiving over the loss of family members. The other act was a ghost story. I you love ghost stories it's not bad. The acting by Byrne and Collette and the boy is really the most intriguing part of the movie. Though, I am suspect to A24 and what they're trying to do with this elevated horror genre. Movies like the loved ones, hills have eyes and Eli Roth's cabin fever have and are honestly better movies. If you loved the quiet ones, babadook and the witch then you'll love this movie. I thought it was wrought with too much indie bs and really couldn't get my head around the fact that this filmmaker tried desperately to combine indie elements into horror. The sad part is he has no respect for the genre and that to me kills my feelings on this movie. I do not respect someone like Krosinski and Lester who have no respect for the genre and badmouth it every chance they get and then turn it and try to reframe it as smart horror. It's not. It's purely boring indie movies because they know indie movies dont sell anymore. They go into a genre and make a movie without even considering the splatter pack from the 2000's... If you are a true horror fan such as myself who loves monster movies such as Hammer's movies, the 70's sploitation and 80's movies such as Street Trash, etc... Do not watch this movie and do not support Ari Lester's film career. He doesn't belong in a genre that made people like Bava, Argento, Coscarelli and Fulci great. Get out as fast as you can.",4,1,6,30 June 2018
Minority Report," perhaps spielberg's best?
","I am not a Spielberg fan, nor do I consider him the greatest filmmaker of all time.  This movie is a wonderful movie though, and I so throughly enjoyed it.  It rivals that of Schindlers list, and E.T. as perhaps Spielberg's best.  A.I. was a dissapointment to some, but this movie should change their mind.  The movie is so well constructed (except for a few parts) that it was almost disgusting.  Bravo Spielberg (the commercial jaugernaut)",Null,0,2,28 June 2002
Memento," wow, another overrated movie.
","This movie had a great plot, and great design.  Especially when they decided to do everything backwards.  (applauds) to Christopher Nolan, for becoming a great director, but do you have more of these, since your brother is the one who wrote the script from a short story?  I think not, I expect Christopher Nolan to fall flat on his face after this movie.  I may be wrong, but we'll see.  If you want to see better movies, watch some David Lynch flicks, like Mulholland Drive.  great flick.",Null,1,5,31 January 2002
Insomnia," good movie, but it was copied for christ sake.
","Well yes, if you can redo a movie from another country you will beable to find the flaws and fix them.  The one thing that I do not likeabout Christopher Nolan is that he doesn't create his own stories,he only extends others.  This was a good movie though, but thedutch film has better performances, and it hurts when someonecan't direct actors, like Nolan.  He's  a good filmmaker, but forMemento his actor wasn't really into his character, he didn't havemuch of emotions or anything like it.  I look forward to seeing hisnext film though,  but he should not be praised as one of the bestever.",Null,0,1,7 June 2002
BlacKkKlansman," Meh
","This movie is clearly overrated. It'll probably die a death the same way most Spike Lee movies die (Does anyone remember his war movie? And the fact that he used racism to try to promote it - Key Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman). The man hasn't made a good movie in almost twenty years but in today's race baiting society with Drumpf in office - he's making more race related movies. As a whole the movie is very subpar with a funny ending. The guy from that 70's show is excellent as David Duke, but there isn't much else. There isn't anything special about it except for our present time. This movie will probably disappear like almost all of Spike's other movies except for maybe 2. Note to Spike Lee - if you want to make a politically and race agenda driven movie do something like Boots Riley. Don't try to say cops are good people. We all know the justice system is incredibly broken.",4,57,132,13 August 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," wow, and things you didn't know!!
","This movie is a great example of where films are going to head towards in the future.  I heard one point that in the near future of the films (such as two towers and return of the king) that they have created a newly special cgi.  In the movies to come the battle scenes where you see all the orcs and men fighting together, they have created a new cgi graphic effect whereas the orcs and humans will react to each other and react to their culture. Strange far be it, and I don't have all the details on it, but amazing in one nature.  I believe that Lord of the Rings is the film that many filmmakers will base their works on in the future.  Another thing is when the hobbits are shorter than Gandalf or any of the humans, they simply used a long angle lense and zoomed in on Frodo or the hobbits, this gave the natural look of gandalf being tall or Frodo looking short.  Amazing!! I mean a film maker who can create new visually stunning things is what all film makers should base their synopsis on.  I cannot wait for the next two so we can learn more from them.",Null,0,2,16 January 2002
Knowing," Hollywood has sunk to new low with Scientology movie
","OK OK OK, so I'm not a fan of most religious movie outside of Religolous and Last Temptation of Christ. What Knowing has become is a fore cry for Scientology and its own religious ideals. I love Alex Proyas. Dark City and the Crow are some of my favorite movies, which is why I went to see this movie. Don't get me wrong, the special effects are astounding, but the plot unbearable. If you aren't a big fan of any type of propaganda film to get you to join a religion like I am, then I don't recommend this movie. I do recommend this movie if you are into disaster movies and big special effects. The acting in this movie is very subpar. Nicholas Cage is like what Sean Penn call's a 'performer' rather than an actor so his performance is understandable. The female lead in this movie is by far one of the worst female leads I've ever seen in a disaster movie. Her lines seemed forced and she didn't know when to express sadness or any other type of emotional feeling that seemed truthful. Overall I give this movie two stars because it had great special effects, but the script, acting and ending take the cake.",2,1,6,17 April 2009
Get Out," Stepford wives but with black people
",Hey I get it... People are sucked into old ideas but instead of feminists it's black people. Good social commentary though.,5,1,6,27 December 2018
Mulholland Drive," ahhhh a fresh sip of David Lynch
","I saw Eraserhead before I even thought of seeing this movie.  I really want to own 'Elephant Man.'  I cannot get enough of David Lynch, he's really one of the only director's who is not influenced by the Hollywood propaganda, a propaganda that ruins artistic movies such as this one.  I do not consider this movie surreal though, I really thought that it was well done, but surrealism to me is more like a dream like stature where your falling down a black hole and can't get out of it.  I consider Jan Svankmeir the clay animator more of a surrealist than this movie was.  Mulholland Drive a mystery perhaps, but not a surrealist movie.  Great movie from start to finish, especially the scene where it hints out the bad dream sequence with the two guys sitting in the restaurant.  Great job Lynch.",10,2,5,25 January 2002
Paranormal Activity," Very good edge of your seat horror movie
","Saw a screening in Seattle and all I gotta say is it is worth the hype. I've been so disappointed with recent horror movies, (and yes I've read threads where people actually liked the Grudge)that I've begun to think that Americans couldn't make horror films anymore. This movie dismayed my thought that this couldn't happen. People were literally screaming and moaning in the audience. The girl who sat next to me couldn't watch the last hour because it was too intense for her. One girl next to my friend was crying she was so terrified. I'd totally recommend this for anyone who wants a good theater going experience because it just heightened the tension. Very simple simple plot, but the way the filmmakers build up the tension is priceless. It kept everyone on the edge of their seat. Highly recommend this movie and hopefully it will shake the system.",9,47,100,26 September 2009
A Beautiful Mind," was expecting something better.
","It is a good movie don't get me wrong.  But I was expecting something better, maybe more artistic or less simplier.  Definately a movie for the simple minded, and unfortnately they take away our fabulous movies.  I do not like Ron Howard, but this movie was already written so Ron Howard had no comment on it.",Null,0,3,30 January 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," overhyped, overplayed, definately not original.
","Good movie, great for all audiences, but George Lucas, just plain horrible. Probably worst director of all time, great special effects wizard, but director=horrible.  Maybe he should let his buddy Steven Spielberg direct the next Star Wars, because Indiana Jones was really good.  Definately not an original idea, and coming from hollywood thats not anything new to realize.  Hollywood=money and only money, no art, no care about film making or anything.  Just as our society is set upon, succeeding and money.  Great job Hollywood.",Null,2,7,30 January 2002
Da 5 Bloods," Awesome. Delroy is so goood!
",Wow... I really think this is Spikes best since school daze and Malcolm X. Delroy's paranoia was so captivating... Reminds me of a modern day Sierra Madre.,10,6,20,14 June 2020
Gladiator," not original, hollywood propaganda
","Wow what can I say, stealing things from Sparticus and Braveheart?  Give me a break, whenever my father watches this movie I laugh because all this money goes into a project like this, and its just no good.  I didn't find this movie fun, just a boring piece of material.  When I saw it the first time I thought it was okay, but now that I watch it I fall asleep almost everytime.",Null,0,4,30 January 2002
Donnie Darko," expecting more
","With a name like Donnie Darko you'd think the movie would be entirely dark with a dark ending.  Overall the movie had some meaning, but the ending could have been a little more complicated and little more dark.  Overall I thought the movie was really intrigueing.  Even if the man stole my idea of making an evil Harvey movie.",Null,0,2,24 March 2002
