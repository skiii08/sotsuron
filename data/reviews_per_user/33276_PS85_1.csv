Casablanca," Gets Better on Every Viewing
","I watched 'Casablanca' last night on the Movie Channel, once again yesterday. This movie gets better every single time I see it, which is about once a year.It's clich√© to say Bogart was wonderful but he is just so good. He is the ultimate of cool. Remember, he ran 'The Rat Pack,' originally, and Sinatra looked up to HIM. Like a basketball player who moves without the ball, Bogart's genius is in his face, his reactions, his eyes. The delivery of his lines is wonderful but he is so much more than that.The other actors are equally wonderful and all the issues regarding the Nazis and the Resistance are planted throughout the movie and it is THIS that I pick up more on every time I see the film.Claude Reins is at the top of his game and some of the bit players SZ Sakall, among them, are just excellent. Paul Henried and Ingrid Bergman are no slouches either.Just a wonderful film watching experience.",10,1,2,2 January 2005
