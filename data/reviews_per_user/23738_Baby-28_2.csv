Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Interesting yet not what I planned
","When I was on my way to the theater with my boyfriend and his brother, I was extatic. It was opening night and I got free tickets. The show that I saw, was nothing like I expected. Unlike the others, there were no fuzzy little animals that I would have loved to take home with me, instead, there was a stupid alien that drove me crazy through out the entire film. I sat through the movie praying he would die, but to no avail. I am quiet disappointed, where's Chewy and the rest of the characters we have grown to love? At least give us a few that we could have enjoyed. I like the movie, but was disappointed. But I have to admit, Luke looks a whole lot better when he's little.",Null,0,1,20 September 1999
Titanic," The worst and most over rated movie of all time
","Titanic is the most over rated movie, I think of the decade. It contains boaring scenes, bad acting on the part of Leo, and unbelivable romances. I don't understand why this movie was so loved. Young girls may enjoy Leo, but I feel that he is totally over rated and a horrible actor. When I first saw him in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, he was remarkable. What happened? I must admit that the special effects were great, but a movie can't ride on effects alone. Especially when it's 3 hours long. I thought it would never end. Lets get over Leo's cute little face and be true to our selves.",1,9,18,3 September 1999
