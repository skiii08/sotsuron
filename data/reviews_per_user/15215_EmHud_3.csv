10 Cloverfield Lane," Psychologically thrilling; wildly feminist; not a sequel
","Firstly, this movie has almost nothing to do with the original Cloverfield. From my understanding, it was a marketing ploy to gain hype and media attention. Apparently, 10 Cloverfield Lane had originally been called The Cellar but was not amassing enough hype. I would not bother watching the original Cloverfield if you have not already seen it. 10 Cloverfield Lane should be regarded as independent from Cloverfield. It can be argued that the two movies take place in the same 'universe'; however, the line is too thin to call this one a sequel. Secondly, it was a great movie overall. It was unpredictable, psychologically thrilling, and uniquely disturbing. John Goodman's character dances along the lines of sanity and insanity throughout the movie which keeps the audience guessing. I understand why Mary Elizabeth Winstead was the first and only choice... the movie couldn't have been done without her. I definitely recommend this to anyone 16+. Although the movie has a 'hard' PG-13 rating, I would say it could easily have been given the R rating due to intense violence.",8,1,2,13 March 2016
The Hateful Eight," I was disgusted in humanity after watching this.
","I've been using IMDb for years, and I had never written a review until now. I needed to make the 8/10 rating of this film go down. I came straight home after seeing the movie; I couldn't function. I was absolutely disgusted. I was disgusted that my friends were in awe of Tarantino... calling him an 'artist' and telling me how 'appreciative' they were of his taste in creative value. I was disgusted that a theater full of people were LAUGHING after one of the characters was shot and writhing in pain on the floor. AND I was even more disgusted that the racial slurs were laughed at. Post-civil war, freedom was nothing to joke about. For that matter, it isn't something to joke about today. I almost walked out of the theater after the MASSACRE of innocent bystanders... for a cause that lacked substance. Yes, it is a movie. It is meant for entertainment. But do we really live in a society where racial slurs are encouraged and unnecessary violence and torture are commended as 'art'? The movie industry, and directors like Quentin Tarantino, are encouraging it. I'm seriously concerned for anyone who commends this movie, laughs at the suffering of humans, and calls Tarantino an artist.",1,139,298,9 January 2016
The Witch," Aesthetically pleasing; lackluster in storyline
","I am puzzled at all the reviews claiming this movie is the 'next big thing.' I love TV shows/films about the Salem Witch Trials, and I was excited to see this one. I have to commend the director for keeping the dialogue close to what it would've been like in the respective time period. However, the lines were mumbled at times and were undecipherable.Aesthetically, it was a nice movie with great cinematography and a notable score. The problem is in the storyline. There is no tangible plot or created suspense. The relationship between the characters and the audience is nonexistent. I wouldn't waste your money in the theater on this one.",4,1,5,27 February 2016
