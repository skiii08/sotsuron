Requiem for a Dream," A movie that will change the way you look at a simple pill.
","I going to start right off by saying that this is one of the most profound movies I have ever seen in my entire life.I have to admit, as mentioned by other reviewers, I found myself not wanting to watch this movie, the drama genre is just not my thing. When I watch a movie I want to enjoy it, not cry, and I guess that's what most people think. While that's OK, from my point of view you have to watch a couple of dramas once in a while. And I warn you, Requiem for a Dream is not your usual drama.The movie doesn't really criticize junkies, it just shows what happens when you try to forget about something in the past with the help of heavy drugs. But it doesn't stop there, no, it goes beyond, namely it criticizes not the dealers, not the crystal business, but the pharmaceutical industry, that's right, because you can also become a drug addict legally, all you need is a doctor to sign you a piece of paper.I don't want to spoil anything so I'm going to stop right here.Long story short, this a movie that'll change the way you think about pharmaceutics. You have got to watch it, regardless of your favorite genre not being drama.Sorry for any grammar mistakes, I'm not a native speaker.",10,0,1,29 November 2013
Gravity," 3D only-movie
","This is a movie starring 2 actors you possibly know, with no character development, little dialog and filmed in front of a green screen.If this movie wasn't starring Sandra Bullock, who has proved once again that she's incredibly good looking, this movie would have flown way more under the radar.If I were you, I'd watch it in 3D, if not, you're missing the point of this movie, which is make you feel as if you where the one who is lost in space. It is indeed a unique experience, but as it isn't fully enjoyable in 2D and/or in a cinema, if I were given a second chance, I would give it a pass.So it is up to you, do you want to pay $/Â€10 to watch a simulation of space or would you rather prefer to watch an actual movie instead?",3,3,4,9 November 2013
