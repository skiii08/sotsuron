Minority Report," Great movie
","It has been a longtime I have seen such a great movie. This movie has a lot of fantasy, science fiction but stays in a realistic thriller of a possible near future reality. I was not informed about this movie. I only knew it was a movie with Tom Cruise. But from the first second I saw what was possible in Dream Works. Steven showed us again the best. I had no idea how long this movie was. But I can say I have never wanted to know the time. From the first to the last scene it was thrilling,...It is the best movie I have seen of the last years.",9,0,0,6 October 2002
