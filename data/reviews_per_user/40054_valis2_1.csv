The Devil's Advocate," A suspenseful, well written movie - until the end...
","I was immediately caught up in this movie.  The character of the young attorney is well played by Keanu Reeves.  Al Pacino is perfect as the diabolical senior partner in the powerful New York law firm.  Although the movie utilizes the device of the millennium and Armageddon, the drama plays out with enough suspense and interesting, intelligent dialogue to keep the viewers interest throughout.  Until the end... the double-twist ending is so tired and contrived, it totally spoiled the film for me.  It was so trite, it was laughable.  And, in my opinion, it was the kiss of death for the film.  Truly a shame to so completely spoil a film in the last few moments.",Null,0,0,12 November 2000
