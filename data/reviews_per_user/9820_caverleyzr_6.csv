Skyfall," Now We're Talking'
","After being let down by Quantum of Solace, I was afraid to revisit Bond on account of his new 'wanna-be-Bourne' look and acting. Thankfully, this film shattered my expectations and is a clear indication that Bond is coming back strong.Daniel Craig soars as a man that has been beaten and destroyed, but somehow refuses to give up. I mean, was anyone worried that Craig would be the worst part of this film? Seriously, I can't think of a film he has been the worst part of, and of course he just kills it here. This guy IS James Bond.The supporting cast is excellent. Kudos to Judy Dench as 'M' for bringing a more emotional and involved role to that character. The villain is amazing as well. Silva is easily one of my top three favorite bond villains of all time now. His first five minutes of screen time contain the best dialogue in the film. I just wish he could have had more time on camera to really scare the audience.My gripes? After the first action scene it takes a long time for the film to really get going, and too much time is spent with establishing shots of the scenery, but these early scenes are ripe with Bond's character development, so I'll settle there. Also, as the movie progresses, the plot starts to really narrow down to three main characters and the conflict between them, and while this enhances the emotional impact, much of the complexity is thrown out the window.Still this is the best bond film since Goldeneye. Welcome back Mr. Bond.",8,1,7,22 November 2012
Memento," There are no words
","Title says it all.There is just no way I could possibly convey what I got out of this film and justify it for others to understand.Memento is Nolan's greatest art piece (The Dark Knight would later become his most appealing 'film/blockbuster,' but this remains his magnum opus in the realm of art).I don't think any one person can call his or herself a Nolan faithful without watching this film. It transcends beauty and normal patterns of rational thought, and, sadly, there may never be another film like it.I urge you to watch this with mature friends and colleagues in a quiet setting to minimize distraction, as it is quite hard to follow even for mature audiences. By its ending monologue, Memento will make you question what motivates you in life, and it is a splendid and terrible question to ponder. Simply put: one of the greatest works of our generation.",10,0,2,29 September 2013
Interstellar," The Perfect Culmination of Camera work, Emotion, and Originality
","Interstellar continues the Nolan tradition of challenging a general audience's expectations while also giving up enough beauty in its visuals and engrossing story to keep us glued.I will say nothing of the plot. Honestly, do not even read the back of the box or the plot synopsis of other reviewers. This is meant to be experienced as one complete piece with nothing given away. The focus here is on human drama with a space backdrop. While the film is breathtaking in scope, it is the dialogue and story that ultimately out-do every other aspect. Nolan, for almost three straight hours, begs us to ask the questions: How much do our emotions govern our logic? At what point does humanity cease when we struggle to survive?These questions are something that could only be presented this well in the context of this film and in the hands of capable writers and the director - they give us no answer. We are meant to infer these meanings and all the while feel ourselves sink into the world being created for us. And what a world it is...I could go on about Interstellar's writing, the score (my god...how is Hans Zimmer still getting better?), the acting and more because these things are all fully realized like nothing I've seen in film, but I'll leave you with this: you need to see Interstellar. Whether you love it, hate it, or just walk away confused, I have a hard time believing someone not being effected by this piece of art. I have never given a film a 10/10, but I wanted to give this film more.",10,0,1,19 August 2015
American Hustle," No Hustle. The Real Deal
","Just got out of the theater for this one. American Hustle is a brilliant blend of great acting, a perfect script, and copious amounts of dark humor to keep everyone thoroughly entertained during the film's two hour and twenty minute run time.Bale absolutely nails it as a sleazy con man that we can somehow relate to and shake our heads at the whole time, and Adams has once again grown as a competent actress to match him. This duo could not have been more perfect for this story. Bradly Cooper also extends his acting range and slowly let's the audience in on the pathetic nature of his character. Cooper had several scenes that had the whole crowd rolling with laughter. ...and the there's Jennifer Lawrence. Wow. Will she ever stop topping her self in these dramatic roles? I was worried about a younger actor standing up to the other heavy weights on screen, but she steals the show in every scene she has. The 'Live and Let Die' scene is bound to wind up a classic.To speak of Hustle's convoluted (but ultimately tried and true) plot would be cheating (hustling) the audience out of the fun residing in this masterpiece. While certain scenes definitely required more developed empathy for the characters to achieve the desired effect, Hustle invests the time to keep us on edge at least, and is a film that gets better with each and every scene.Go see it with attentive eyes and you shall not be disappointed.9/10",9,2,8,25 December 2013
Django Unchained," Tarantino's Masterpiece
","I viewed a trailer for Django around 3 months ago with vague interest and made a mental note to check it out, knowing that it would either sink or soar. It's tough to imagine Tarantino writing a better piece of fan fiction than that of his previous film, Inglorious Basterds, but he has now eclipsed that film along with Pulp Fiction with his newest work, Django: Unchained. Django is the ultimate story of retribution with an (anti)hero and motive the audience can all get behind. Jamie Foxx owns the role of a lifetime as the slave given freedom and the opportunity to exact his pain on the plantation owners ruling the south. Things get more complicated as the story progresses, but never so much that the audience becomes lost. That's not to say that Foxx steals the show, every actor is in full force for the entire film, and at no point is there a weak line thrown in. Django is an incredibly violent film, but this is to the film's credit as it exemplifies the horror of the slavery era and the terrible things those people had to go through. You will probably hate the villains just as much as Django by the film's midway point. But to no surprise, the most intense portions of the film are the long, drawn-out conversations conducted by Christopher Waltz's character (don't be surprised if he gains another Oscar this year, he's earned it). There is no other film I have seen in recent memory that deserves a ten star rating as much as this one. You don't have to love westerns to get into Django, you just have to love good films. Don't miss this one.",10,0,6,3 January 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," A film that ACTUALLY lives up to the hype.
","Title says it all. Epic storyline, perfect musical score, perfect acting, and one of the most emotional endings I have ever seen. This trilogy is the 'star wars' of our generation. I'm not kidding. Oh, and for all of you IMDb users posting about the plot holes...really? People, it's called 'willing suspension of disbelief' ever heard of it? Go see the film and enjoy yourself. This is the one of the only action film I have seen outside of its prequel that doesn't sacrifice story for more explosions. Every character is fully realized and acts their part in such a convincing manner that they become more 3-dimensional than most characters do throughout an entire trilogy. And Bane? Oh man, Bane is one of the best villains you will ever have the pleasure to see (and quite a well-scripted one too).This is more than a comic-book film. This is a new classic. The Dark Knight has risen.",Null,8,13,25 July 2012
