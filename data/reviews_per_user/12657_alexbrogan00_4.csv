Ford v Ferrari," I'm not a car or racing guy, and I loved it.
","You don't have to go in with any prior knowledge of vehicles, Ford, or racing history. It may help with feeling more attached to the characters but I feel this movie did a great job with character development. Great sound track. Great racing scenes. Great sound effects. Great acting. I went in expecting a boring 'dad movie' and when the movie ended I had tears in my eyes and I had a whole new appreciation for the sport. It also felt like a nice history lesson. Don't do any prior research to the film and go in with an open mind, and enjoy the amazing performances by Christian Bale and Matt Damon.",9,3,3,3 March 2020
World War Z," Fast paced, fun, decent ending!
","Don't worry no spoilers. I'm aware Paramount had over 25 million dollars in reshoots for the initial unsatisfying ending. Go look it up after you've see the movie and you'll realize the theatrical ending was quite the improvement. Maybe needed a little bit of explanation but overall most questions were answered. Quick. Straight to the point with the action. I would have like a LITTLE more backstory besides 'an ex member of the United Nations' because Gerry gets all this special treatment throughout the film because of his previous job, yet they never really explained exactly what he did. Big budget! Some zombie scenes you could obviously tell were CGI but overall impressive and I love how large of a scope this movie paints. Chaos all over the world and you get to see it all instead of just cheap news story exposition. Try to avoid trailers if you already haven't see them, and go in blind, and with an open mind. It's a fun time. Also make sure you watch the Unrated cut! Only a few minutes longer with a little more action and blood!",8,3,3,1 February 2020
Gone Girl," Intense and good quality.
","I love a well made film that shines all around. I'm especially a fan of the clean cinematography and lack of shaky cam. From beginning to end you're in for an intense ride that's well written, and supported by great acting. A story like this is very unique and this film should definitely be on your watchlist. It'll go down as a classic if it hasn't already.",9,1,1,3 March 2020
The Martian," Extremely creative.
","This film is great. Full of clever ideas and very clever writing. All star cast, amazing special effects (Ridley Scott's bread and butter), a stellar score, and a story they had me on the edge of my couch for the whole film. A lot of good one liners. My only gripes were that some of the comedy didn't land for me, and I would have liked to see a more emotional ending for select characters.",9,0,0,3 March 2020
