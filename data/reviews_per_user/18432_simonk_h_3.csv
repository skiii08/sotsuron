United 93," I don't want to be clich√©d but...
","When people say a certain film is THE film of such and such a year, I am naturally sceptical. So many films seem to gain that title and , whilst being impressive, you will not think too much about it afterwards. I think United 93 will stay with me for a long long time to come. Paul Greengrass' visual style is entirely appropriate here. I cannot think what it is about the hand held grainy camera that director's seem to love nowadays (sometimes I think it's a fad) but Greengrass is the only director, for me, who can pull it off properly. The shots throughout the whole film were wonderfully realised; muted colours, great light and to the point. I have not seen Oliver Stone's 'World Trade Center' but I am not sure that I'll bother now. Much as I appreciate him as a director, I think his cinematic style is not suited to these sorts of stories (whatever 'these sorts of stories' are. That was very shallow, wasn't it?). You only have to look at the posters to these films and you can tell the difference. 'World Trade Center' has four very good looking name actors looking off into the middle distance. Very nice; very Hollywood. 'United 93' has a lot of normal looking faces, both young and old, looking at something. These faces seem to have a purpose to look away. I think also that budget is a contributing factor. Oliver Stone had $60,000,000 to play with, whereas Greengrass had $15,000,000. A much lower budget restricts people I think and forces them to look at the little picture as opposed to a broad canvas. The shock of seeing the planes hit the towers was incredible. I have not realised the true magnitude of the whole event before. However, when those images flashed up and the people reacted, I felt a tensing of my stomach and a definite feeling of shock and horror. It is probably because they have milked the whole thing to death through whatever means possible but my senses have become numbed to the American predicament. This film really brought it home to me. These people were ordinary people, on the face of things, seemingly undeserving of such a fate. But then the film does not show us bad people or people to dislike, if you will. The terrorists are clearly believing in what they are doing and really into the whole affair. They will not stop because they believe it is the right thing to do. It was a film that made me think, how can I watch another film ever a again? All these millions of dollars of money being poured into so-called entertainment and it should be spent on other, far more important things. When I become a director, I shall certainly endeavour to make relevant films like this one. And yes! That last image will be burned into your memory forever.",10,11,22,18 January 2007
Once Upon a Time in America," Better than The Godfather
","I can't watch the Godfather. It's so boring! Both these films are slow but there is a difference, which I think I've figured out. Once Upon a Time in America is slow because it has an attitude. This attitude needs to play itself out over each scene. Example: Noodles returns to gang headquarters and stirs his coffee for two minutes. The gang know that something has gone wrong between him and Deborah and want him to discuss it. Noodles does not want to discuss it and so stirs his coffee until someone talks about something else. The Godfather is slow because nothing happens. Example: The scenes in the hospital with Michael and Don Vito. Nothing is going on. It's no fun to watch. It's not entertaining. Still, come to think of it, Once Upon a Time in America is not exactly entertaining as such. Those rape scenes are really horrible and I, personally, can't watch them. However, one can appreciate how great a film it is and what an achievement in story-telling. Leone does not attempt to make these men seem sympathetic because they are bad men. And though it seems simplistic to say it; bad men do bad things. What can you do? That is just one facet of the strength of the movie, though. The child actors are a revelation. The kid who plays Dominic is brilliant, why we never saw more of him and less of Macauly Culkin is anybody's guess. The other thing is that they look just like young versions of the older actors. The final word, however, must go to Robert de Niro and James Woods. James Woods has rarely been better. He's come close, no doubt about that but never bettered. De Niro is on excellent form with a marvellously restrained performance. Sometimes you have to have a protagonist who is not an extrovert and this is just that character. Noodles, as portrayed by De Niro, is unhappy with his lot for several reasons and let's people know about subtley. The best Leone film? Difficult to say. They're all great films so this would definitely rank as one of the best and certainly deserves more praise than it gets, even now, in the film world.",10,3,7,13 July 2006
Casino," The usual comparison with GoodFellas
","First up, you definitely need to be in the mood to see this movie. I can watch a three hour movie no problem but with this movie It can really feel like three hours if you are just watching it for the sake of something to watch. Comparison with GoodFellas is inevitable and personally, I think that both movies are just as good as each other. Casino has certain qualities that GoodFellas lacks and GoodFellas has certain qualities that Casino lacks. Casino doesn't quite have the density of secondary characters that enriched the world of GoodFellas. It really felt like a community but then, that was the point of GoodFellas; that Henry Hill was being invited into a big family of sorts and that he would witness it's love and appeal but also it's horror and debauchery. Casino is more centred around 'Ace' Rothstein and Nicky Santoro. The secondary characters are there to provide their cog in the story and then go home. However, Casino has more grit and really conveys the pomp and greed surrounding the so-called 'high' society of Vegas, not just the pathetic punters. It is also a benefit to hear of how the casinos work under the gaze of the Mob through the heavy use of voice-oveR. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are a fantastic double act and one cannot hide a certain envy towards Scorsese that he is able to wield the acting might of these two in his movies. Just seeing them having an argument is an acting tour de force (whatever that means, but I know it's positive). It's amazing that, like Temeura Morrison in 'Once Were Warriors', in that little scene with his son, Joe Pesci can make Nicky Santoro seem sympathetic. This must surely be the hallmark of a great actor. These are two actors at the top of their game under one of the greatest directors of all time, not just today. Enjoy. That said, Sharon Stone is as good as the madonna-cum-whore, Ginger, who starts the movie as a real figure in the world of gambling but ends up as a spiteful junkie, not even caring towards her child. I have not seen many of her films but I am sure that, just like Bruce Willis, if given the right roles or right director, she can act as good as the best of them. The supporting players such as; Don Rickles, James Woods, Kevin Pollack and L.Q. Jones manage to make their characters fresh and interesting in the time space given to them. The violence is one thing that people always comment on when it comes to this film. There is no doubt that it is pretty strong violence but what gets me is that the scene where Nicky stabs that man with the pen never gets a mention whereas the 'head-in-a-vice' scene always does. I see the pen scene as being a whole lot more graphic and shocking than the vice scene. This is because, with the vice scene, you get a couple of big warnings before hand so you know what will happen (also, the violence is more suggested, even though you can see what is happening to the victim, you do not see the gory details). With the pen scene, however, it takes you totally off guard. The close up of the pen entering the neck is more akin to Hostel than GoodFellas. It certainly took me off guard. What I want to talk about, finally, is the climax. Is it a climax? If so, it is a very played out climax. Maybe because it concerns the fates of several characters in the movie as opposed to just one big bad guy. Certainly Nicky's fate is drawn and bloody and the re-invention of Vegas is a part of that climax. It is a frank and final ending to the film and probably very fitting, as it shows us that crime doesn't pay for some people. In conclusion, I think that Casino is a definite Scorsese classic and one that should gain as much praise as his more lauded works. Despite some minor quibbles, it is up there with the better of Hollywood movies and hopefully will mature as time goes on rather than being regarded as the naughty younger brother of GoodFellas",10,1,2,17 July 2006
