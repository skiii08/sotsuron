Hereditary," Good acting, terrible ending
",Gabriel Byrne looked like he regretted this movie as he was making it. Collette was clearly way to young for him. The whole thing was way too over-the-top and trying too hard to be artsy. Kept hoping it would get better. I really like Toni collete but this was a poor choice for her and the rest of the cast.,3,1,7,27 September 2018
