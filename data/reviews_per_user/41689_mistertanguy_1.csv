E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," ET, The greatest beautiful genius movie comment from Spielberg
","E.T movie is a good movie for children. However the movie gives us a reflection about ourselves as humans. It introduces us the following question; 'Are there some others civilizations in the universe?'.I think for that time it was a revolution and it makes the E.T success. About the story there are a lot of funny moment by example when the Eliot's sister saw E.T for the first time and began to scream or the moment when it's Halloween night in the movie and some children trick or treat with E.T.I recommend this movie as a familial movie which, I think, ought to be watched with the children. I think this movie will be stay well-known Ps: I'm learning English so if there are some people who wanted to speak with me to improve my English skills, it will be great.Sincere",10,0,1,6 November 2009
