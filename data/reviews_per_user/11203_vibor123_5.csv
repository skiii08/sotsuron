The New World," If you are a normal person...you will stay away from this!!
","This movie very boring and very badly directed. I don't know why is rated 6.9? For what? Plot isn't that bad and acting is solid, but thrust me the director destroyed everything worth watching in this movie. Camera is always running around looking for something, music is a little boring and there is no normal dialog....always music, then shooting the trees, then grass, then little conversation a grand finale the f**** sun....my recommendation is to skip this movie!! If you are looking for action and killing or love story and normal movie Don't watch this one. This movie is for snobs and gay bookworms, maybe some 6 years old girl may like it because of the Colin Farell with a long hair and earing!",1,0,3,4 January 2011
Sucker Punch," Not that bad, but it will disappoint you greatly.
","First of all, you must give credit to Snyder about one thing: in the world full of remakes he made completely original movie with solid plot.Let's start with babes: They are very sexy and wearing a tight and provoking clothes, is this were on purpose like in Bay style I don't know, but it was good to watch. Acting is barely mediocre, but barely, sometimes is seems like everybody just hardly wait for a pause....:( Visuals are great, not THAT great, but great. You have different kinds of battlefields (which were great scenes and scenery), stormy hospital and one lounge bar. It could be better, but I liked it .The main problem with this movie is it can't glue audience for the seat, sometimes it gets very boring (like Watchmen, if you don't like watchmen you wouldn't like this either) and annoying, plot is let's say little predictable and it has no atmosphere like other Snyder movies (Dawn Of The Dead, 300), it is just an ordinary flick which falls into abyss as soon as you watch it.",6,1,1,9 July 2011
Watchmen," Lack of action!!!
","This movie has great effects but they are to rare, to little action to much story!!! I never read comic watchmen but i like the story and its is very well told but on the boring way, talk, talk, some shooting, talk, talk..... In the trailer i saw great movie with lots of action but when i saw it there was 10 percent of my expectations. Comedian is only character worth watching... this film will provide satisfaction only for fans and those who like long movies with no action, there is all i can say about this movie so i will write blah blah.",7,1,3,22 August 2009
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Overrated and snobic!!!
","This movie is so overrated. Plot is, I must admit very original, but the whole thing, directing, soundtrack and actors are so confusing....only thing that I liked about this movie is....hahahah I really cant remember! Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are so lame, the first one we used to watch goofing himself and Kate is just not that good actress at all, especially in this movie. I hated this movie from beginning to the very end and everything about it! And why is rating so high, usually I agree with all IMDb ratings, but this one is wrong. I think that this movie is similar to another f*** up Carrey movie 'Number 23' and 'Lost in Translation' which is most boring movie of all times (and this one is second). I would recommend this movie for those 1% of those people (based on box office worldwide) who really like this kind of movies....snobs and gays...have fun, rest of you STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE!!!",6,1,3,12 January 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," 'Look at me... you have your mother's eyes.'
","I didn't read the book, but according to this movie it must have been a masterpiece (like all others). The movie itself was much darker than past sequels, even much darker than Part 1 which was great also. I just can not believe that young trio from the Sorcerses Stone could grow up so effective and seamlessly, that's why J.K. Rowling is so good; she can make you nostalgic and proud of her characters and they did exactly the same thing in the movie. Music was darker, more epic and adapted very well on the movie. My best scene was when Harry banish Snape from Hogwarts and prepare for attack.....such a great piece of cinematography, music, atmosphere..great job. Actually the whole movie was very well directed and written, but because of gigantic book they could't put it all in the movie. At the moments it seems that the movie is a mess because of that. I gave it 8/10 because of that and the fact the movie overall wasn't a perfect. We have dub acting sometimes, plot holes to anyone without previous knowledge of the book and the script could be written much better. This movie is great and I recommended it to any fans of Harry Potter, sci-fi fans, and all children in the world.",8,0,1,1 December 2011
