The Ring," The scariest movie i have ever seen
",What a stupid idea for a movie.  But they did a great job.  I do not get scared by movies.  I cannot think of one movie that scared me like this one did.  I couldn't look at circles for a week.  I thought it was well done too.  And it left room for thought.,Null,1,1,23 April 2003
