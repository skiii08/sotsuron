Hereditary," :O
","Sometimes I was ' ooooooook movie that was a bit more stressful that it should,but I like it'. Really good and old fashioned thriller with an excellent performance by Toni Collette. 
Damn man, that woman is the most unlucky mother in Hollywood history!
8/10 stars because the ending disappointed me. Sometimes I just want to stay in mystery.
Ari's first attempt was pretty beautiful in general. I hope he is not going to Shyamalan his carrier... :D",10,1,2,1 September 2018
