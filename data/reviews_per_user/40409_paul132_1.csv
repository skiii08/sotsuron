Sucker Punch," very under-rated movie !!
","The very first time i saw this film i was a bit sceptical if I'm honest, but as the film goes on it pieces the story together and parts of the film at the start where you thought 'what is going on' all starts to make sense, its a very unique movie and if given concentration you WON'T be disappointed. half my friends hated it BUT, this half of friends don't really have the best attention span, its a film you have to be patient with and concentrate on everything that goes on.when I'd watched the whole thing i was a bit gob smacked at how enjoyable it was, its what i would call a 'very cool film' all round its a very well thought out and very clever movie for people who give it a chance and are up for a 'work things out for yourself' kind of movie.",9,2,4,13 September 2012
