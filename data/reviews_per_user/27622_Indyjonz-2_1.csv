Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Way Way too childish!
","This is what George Lucas wanted us to see after 16 years?Jar Jar Stinks?It is a very poor script making it hard for the actors to gain any feeling for their characters.  This was actually written before Star Wars IV?  If it was Lucas edited his version radically.  How else do you explain the wonder of the first trilogy when cast against this hob glob throw together he has going now?  Anakin built C3PO?  Yeah right!  Where did these stupid Medaclorines come from?  No mention of them in the future,  only in the past right?  The Queen of Naboo is going to fall for a 10 year old -- Okay, sure!The only redeeming part of this film is the Light Sabre Duel between Obi Wan, Gui Jon and Darth Maul, other than that you could toss the entire episode in the toilet and not miss anything when Episode 2 comes out. Let's hope Lucas's children grow up fast so he doesn't have to retard Episode 2 the way he did Episode 1!",Null,0,1,17 April 2000
