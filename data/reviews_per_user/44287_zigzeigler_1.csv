Marie Antoinette," dreadful
","I was SO pleased with 'Lost in Translation' I just had to see Coppola's 'Marie Antionette.' Quelle domage! This movie D-R-A-G-S on F-O-R-E-V-E-R. All I can charitably imagine is that they had such lovely images she couldn't bear to part with A-N-Y of them. As was said of Longfellow, she didn't know the value of a trash can. And now, because my comment must be at least 10 lines long I have to go on at even greater length telling you the same thing over and over so that I can reach the length limit. Perhaps the same thing happened to Ms Coppola? Whoops. Still not long enough so we add another line--much like the little coda added at the end of this interminable movie. How very ironic.",3,1,2,24 June 2007
