Vertigo," A great work of art
","Vertigo,is for me,the best film of all time.It is also, a surrealist masterpiece.I have seen this film for more than ten times and i consider Vertigo, a haunting and disturbing experience.Vertigo's images have the surreal quality of the De Chirico Metaphysical Painting.Vertigo isn't so only a great movie,but one of the greatest works of art of the last century.",10,2,3,5 February 2001
