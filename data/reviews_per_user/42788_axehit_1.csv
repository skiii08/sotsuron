The Perks of Being a Wallflower," The best movie EVER.
","Dear Friend, this is the best movie EVER. A wonderful story backed by the wonderful performances of the trio, Logan Lerman, Emma Watson and Ezra Miller not forgetting the extremely lovable English teacher Mr. Anderson played by Paul Rudd. Spoiling nothing, this is a story to which some of us can relate to. This movie has been successful in catching the true essence of teenage life. Logan Lerman expertly plays the character of a wallflower Charlie. His expressions and body language matches the traits of a child who has a communication problem in addition to his own mental disorder. Emma Watson is amazing as Sam and Ezra Miller perfectly plays his role. The movie leaves us with a good feeling about life. No matter how bad things get, sometimes all you need is just some good friends. However this is just a story but for the moment, I FEEL INFINITE.",10,0,2,12 August 2016
