Source Code," This Train Ride will be the best ride of your life
","Anyone who watches 'Source Code' and then gets a feeling to review it, knows only one thing; one spoiler and the movie may fall apart for the viewer. I really want to speak about every moment of this movie from start till end, but alas those spoilers may screw up everything for a film fanatic like me, probably reading this to judge whether get this movie or not?? Well, I'll make it short for you buddy. Get it! No questions, just do as I say. 'Cause no matter how much basic this movie seems like in terms of topic (America under terrorist attack, lone soldier only one capable enough to stop it), but the Director and especially Jake did such an awesome job to capture your attention even when the movie (seemingly) repeats one scene again and again, that there is literally no sense of boredom applicable.Instead of focusing on special effects, explosions and exhaustive chase scenes, the movie delivers in tensity, drama and emotions. I won't spoil it for anyone new here, but there is a scene in the movie, after which I really wanted to pick up my phone and make the call. Those who have seen it, will probably understand quickly.If you have come that far in reading this, then you are probably convinced enough to catch this movie. If not, just try and support original cinema for once, not every movie needs to be based on comic or some teen novel ;) Enjoy!",10,2,3,19 July 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Harry Potter's Last Act finally unveiled
","Before I start this review, lets make some things clear: 1. I love the books more than the movies but I do realize that not every word of the book can be reproduced in the film due to many budgetary and technical reasons, so my focus will remain to the film only. 2. I watched the film in 2D screening, my rating may have been different considering the experience, but I am sure it won't play much part in this movie.Well, the final chapter of this awesome saga begins where the previous ended. The movie opens with a mild but haunting vocal soundtrack, which sets the mood of the dark and dramatic tensity that was to be expected. This is where I felt the first flaw in the movie. All of the trailers of this movie had epic orchestras used in trailer musics, but here to express the dark tone, the whole movie did not push it self to the epic level in terms of music. I really wanted the music to be uplifting enough, but even in the last half of the movie, the soundtrack was same as if the movie was just beginning. I missed the edginess of soundtracks of Lord of the Rings Trilogy and Transformers Trilogy, they are still simply awesome.If you have read the books, you already know the prime role of three leads of the movie in more than half of the movie. All in all, the end objective was to defeat he-who-must-not-be-named. As the movie grows darker, so does the lighting of the movie. Trust me, although it was a 2D screening, some scenes were so dark that I had to really look carefully to trace out Demontors in the sky. Considering more than 40 minutes of this movie uses those dark scenes, it was disappointing to see that cinematographer could not capture proper lights in certain scenes, perhaps to express darker tones by the end of the movie, but it nearly made the process rather painful. I hope BluRay fixes it.As expected, movie was not focused on anyone else, this was Harry's return to his spot and his 'relation' (I hope that's the right word) with the awesome dark lord. But it was not him or the Dark Lord who stole the show in terms of acting and expression; it was Severus Snape (The Great Alan Rickman). This guy actually got the chance by the last of the movie, but he did his role justice too well. Although everyone did their part well, but Snape was almost as believable as any of the fellow persons that I interact with on daily basis.Lastly, it was a mixed feeling to see an epic saga coming to an epic finality. But I am also glad that it ended well. I hope when WB reboots this franchise (they are doing these kind of reboots a lot so I am assuming this as well), they make 3-4 parts out of each book, so that we get to know and see everything that was left out for the sake of time and money. Enjoy the movie!",8,0,0,24 July 2011
