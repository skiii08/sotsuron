Casablanca," I hate 'love' movies but I love Casablanca.
","Call me cynical, but I hate romance movies.  Maybe it's because I'm tired of the usual familiar superficial love stories, where love is merely an abstraction of a self-centered/self-satisfying emotion.  Yet despite this, 'Casablanca' remains as one of my all-time favorite movies.  It's hard to say what makes this movie so great.  Maybe its because it delivers a much more REAL romance, of self-sacrificial love; or maybe its more simply that Ingrid Bergman is possible the most gorgeous woman to ever walk on this planet since the great Helen of Troy.  Whatever the reason, 'Casablanca' remains genuine, flawless, and an example of greatness.",10,1,1,5 October 2000
