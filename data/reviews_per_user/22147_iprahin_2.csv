Blade Runner 2049," Disappointing and overly long follow up to original
",1 hour too long art house movie. Feel no empathy for any of these characters unlike original. Disappointing movie only redeemed by beautiful cinematography and visual effects.,6,0,1,24 October 2019
Gravity," Waste of time
",Only worth seeing for 3D I assume as no other redeeming features.,3,0,2,24 October 2019
