50 First Dates," Best Adam Sandler ever!
","Best Adam Sandler ever. Cudos to the writer!They want me to write more. Unique concept, well executed. Set in Hawaii - what can I say. Somewhat schmatzy but heartwarming. The ending made me feel like the ending in Field of Dreams when the players walk out of the corn field.",Null,0,0,17 June 2020
Thor: Ragnarok," Misunderstood
",I think both the reviewers who give this a low rating and the ones who give it a high score are both correct. The low score reviews don't understand that Marvel is trying to appeal to a wider adult audience ala 'Deadpool'. The high scorers like the comedy along with the story even if it doesn't fit in with the usual MCU.,8,1,2,27 April 2018
A Quiet Place," Well made - very little plot
","To me this was a well directed, well acted, well photographed waste of time. A series of fairly predictable incidents with the aliens where the outcomes were transparent except one. Even the ending which I hoped would be climatic was pretty obvious. Very little plot. I'm surprised it got such a high rating on IMDB.",4,0,0,11 July 2018
