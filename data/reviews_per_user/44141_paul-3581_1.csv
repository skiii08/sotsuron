National Treasure: Book of Secrets," A Great Follow up , Leaving plenty of need for part 3 .
","It has to be said before i get into the review , that i was impressed with the depth of Conspiracy in the first outing for this Franchise. After watching the Second installment i appreciate the depth of the first film even more.Nick Cage and co-star Diane Kruger share an almost un-natural chemistry, there characters (Benjamin Gates and Abigail Chase) Seem to be connected on a level that only they can understand.Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) is an integral part of the cast, and i feel without his down to earth Stupdity this film would miss the non-historical amongst us.There is the expected plot lines of Gates family name being smeared, and he sets out to regain his family honour, Along the way the person who smeared the family name turns into the villain and is searching for the same thing as Gates. They find hidden maps and Gates Kidnaps The President(Bruce Greenwood),This is sure to keep those of you into Conspiracy theories and good fun adventures happy for some time. Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris), Agent Sadusky (Harvey Keitel), Patrick Gates (Jon Voight) and Emily Appleton (Helen Mirren) Complete the main casting of this sure to be Classic Trilogy Filler.",9,1,3,2 January 2008
