The Blair Witch Project," A great movie which (sadly) many will never appreciate
","!!! SOME SPOILERS IN HERE... DO NOT READ ON IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM!!!I saw The Blair Witch Project a few days ago and I truly believe it is one of the most original and frightening movies I have ever seen. Sadly, based on the comments I have been reading on this and other websites-- the beauty of this movie will go unnoticed by many. This movie is not trying to play into the American public's expectations. It is NOT supposed to look Aaron Spelling perfect with lighting and framing and clear images. This move is 'supposed' to be shot by 3 film students. If all of the camera shots were perfectly lighted and the camera was tripod still it would be ludicrous.... for those of you who think the film is 'too shaky' or 'poorly made,' keep in mind that this was done ON PURPOSE in order to make the film seem authentic.For those of you who whine because there's no guts and gore, or cat scares, or digitalized special effects-- I pity you. Assuming that horror as a 'genre' is only scary or acceptable if it follows the pattern of Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street rejects some fabulous movies. Just as every comedy doesn't have to have the same stock elements, horror films can also deviate. This movie was amazing precisely because it DIDN'T buy into the over-played and overdone technique of using blood and guts to scare. Instead, this movie sets up a valid premise and allows this scenario to run to a (semi) logical conclusion.While everyone's entitled to their own opinion, I find it sad that many people will never accept this movie simply because it doesn't conform to their stock view of what a film 'should be like.' There were 'effects' before digitalized effects and there are horror movies without a single bit of on screen violence. To reject movies on face because they're different than you might expect is to miss many, many wonderful films.
For those who are open to something different, this movie might really scare you. It's not SUPPOSED to be like Halloween or Prom Night or similar films... and maybe, if you're open to new ideas-- that's a GOOD THING!",Null,1,3,23 August 1999
