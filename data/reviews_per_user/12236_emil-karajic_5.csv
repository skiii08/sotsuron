The Incredible Hulk," A visually stunning and exciting movie!
","Now this is what I call a movie for the casual fans. I enjoyed the film every second of it, right down to the microscopic details in the lore and animation, to the grand action scenes and the marvelous acting, not just from Edward Norton but basically from the whole cast.The movie progresses nicely with a steady pace. The action scenes are logical, lengthy and totally wicked. The calm dialog scenes are in contrast are calm, short and sweet. They are to the point and a lot of the time hilarious if you know at least a bit of the Hulk lore. The intro scene was a nice way to fill you in on how the Hulk got started and all that, so the movie basically tells you everything you need to know about Hulks beginnings in under 3 minutes, so you can jump directly into the main storyline. I liked that in X-Men Origins: Wolverine and The Watchmen too, so maybe this will become a must have in superhero movies.There are many praises to be sang about the whole presentation so lets start with the most obvious, and that is the quality of the visual design. The Incredible Hulk looks absolutely amazing. The effort that was put into animating every little muscle in the Hulks body, every vein, pore, scar and drop of water on his skin is epic. And the attention to detail is just awesome, if you look for it. For example in one scene you can see the artery on his biceps beat in the rhythm of his hearth. Also the whole movie scenery is presented in a greenish hue, witch is to be expected, but it is not just a post production filter effect, as in The Matrix, but the green color is embedded into the scene itself. So the movie is full of green lights, trees and grass, green liquids, items and so on. Plus Banners journey takes you through many different locations but still manages to keep a sense of consistency and theme.The cast is perfect down right to the last background soldier. Edward Norton fits like a glove for the role of Banner in a similar way Hugh Jackman is perfect for the Wolverine. You don't need to see Norton act, you can just look at a still picture to know that this is Bruce Banner. You can immediately recognize a smart, peace loving man, that wont hurt a fly. And that is a casting miracle in it self. To get such a perfect contrast going within a character is a hard thing to achieve. The puny and peaceful pacifist Bruce Banner turns into a raging, smashing and impossible to kill Hulk, a contrast made in heaven. Tim Roth, Liv Tyler and William Hurt also did a bang up job.The ending is amazing, that is all I'm going to say. This is the type of movie that makes me run out of the movie theater to the nearest Internet point to check when is the sequel coming out. I will not compare this movie with the Hulk from 2003 because there is nothing to compare. The new one outshines the previous one in all aspects. Marvel Entertainment is off to an amazing start with movies such as The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man so let's hope they keep up the pace and keep bringing us marvelous superhero action.",9,1,1,20 April 2010
Gravity," I don't get it, I really really don't!
","OK. I do not get the praise this movie is getting. In short - it has no plot (get from point A to point B), the characters are unbelievable and cliché and have totally unrealistic relationships with one another (eg. they work together as astronauts - which takes a lot of time of working and training together and a lot of team work - but Clooney doesn't even know where Sandra is from, or has she any kids), the acting isn't awful but it's not really good either, Sandra's monologues are ridiculous, the physics are way off, the scenario is ridiculously unbelievable...I could go on and on. The one thing this movie has going for it is the visual effects which are some of the best I have ever seen, ever! If you must see this movie see it on a big 3d screen but leave your IQ at the door. I just think it's way, way overrated and dumbed down!",5,3,6,1 January 2014
Iron Man 2," Too bad it's not like 'The Dark Knight'!
","I had colossal expectations for this movie. That was a bad mistake. I expected to relive 'The Dark Knight' moment. A perfect sequel. I expected Mickey Rourke to give a performance worthy of Heath Ledgers Joker and I hoped for a deep and intriguing story. Alas none of my hopes and dreams came true. But it was still a pretty good movie.No need to waste words on the visuals. They are everything you expect them to be in a modern Marvel movie - marvelous.The acting is pretty solid. Robert Downey Jr. was cool, funny, egocentric and everything you expect Tony Stark to be. I though I would miss Terrence Howard but Don Cheadle did a good job as a recast Rhodes. I was a little disappointed at Rourke, he did a pretty swell job but still it was not one of his best performances. Maybe I got that impression because of the lack of depth the writers gave the character, or maybe the very little dialog he had.The action was nice and entertaining and as its predecessor it had a few very funny moments nicely and delicately put in place. Also there was a few details that made the whole experience a little more special like Don Cheadles opening line that went something like 'It's me, I'm here, get used to it.', and can be understood as a response to the recast from Terrence Howard.All in all it's a very entertaining and visually beautiful movie, but it falls a little short from Iron Man (2008). The story maybe has the depth but the presentation of it felt a little rushed. It also felt like the movie should be at least 20 minutes longer or so. Also the soundtrack hasn't got the power of the first movie.If you love Marvel you will probably like this movie. If you like action you will probably like this movie. If you liked Iron Man from 2008 you will probably like this movie. And if you see Iron Man 2 levelheaded and not bearing sky high expectations you will probably love this movie.",7,7,17,29 April 2010
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," A solid action movie.
","It is a good action movie, but that's mostly all it is, just another action movie.If you switch your brain to 'off' mode at the 20th Century Fox logo at the start of the movie you will probably enjoy it, whether you are a Marvel fan or not. But if you expect attention to detail, deep storyline with an intriguing plot and ocean deep dialog between the awesome action scenes, you will be disappointed. There are a few 'How the hell did he get there all of a sudden?!' moments, as well as 'Why in Gods name is he doing that!?' and 'That detail is so obviously OFF', but the sight of Hugh Jackman roaring and tearing things apart kind of makes those moments easily forgiven.On the other hand the action scenes are great, the characters even more so. The animations are really nice and some scenes are so beautiful its almost breathtaking. The cast is pretty amazing and the characters they play complement with them nicely. There probably is no one better suited to play Wolverine then Hugh Jackman, as he already did in the X-Men Trilogy (2000, 2003, 2006) perfectly. He is definitely one of the best looking super action heroes on the big screen, and not only that, he is a half decent actor too.All and all I give the movie a 7/10. One grade down from 10 because of inattention to detail, another one down for the cliché dialog and the lack of originality in story depth and another one down for failing to invoke the subjective feeling of immense and ultimate awesomeness I search for in movies. I got that from The Dark Knight and The Watchmen for example. Both films are excellent super hero movies that combine action and drama perfectly. X-Men Origins: Wolverine certainly tries its best in the drama department, but drops just a little short.So if you enjoyed the X-Men Trilogy you will definitely enjoy X-Men Origins: Wolverine and if you didn't see the X-Men Trilogy yet, watch Wolverine first, you probably wont regret it.",7,1,2,19 April 2010
Grudge Match," WOW! Why can't Stallone just make good movies like this one all the time!
","I'll be brief. I loved the movie. The actors are great and absolutely all of them nail their characters! The story is gripping and awesome funny but it also has a lot of drama and tear drop moments. I don't like Kevin Hart too much but even he was awesome.I love to see Stallone acting in good movies, because hey, he isn't a bad actor. I do not understand why he does like 5 terrible movies like Bullet to the head and then does one totally awesome performance and again goes back to the mindless 80's action sludge.If you are a Stallone fan, boxing fan, DeNiro fan, or just love a heart warming story with senior citizens beating the crap out of each other, go see this one.",9,10,18,11 January 2014
