Ali," When We Were Serfs...
","Cassius Clay [Smith] overcomes many obstacles (including his name) to be the Undisputed Heavyweight Champion of the World.Oh dear!  Surely the basic tenet of a biopic is to tell the viewer something about the title character above and beyond the collection of cliches and soundbites we've already come to know and...Michael Mann must have had the best intentions here, I mean - God knows he's not a bad director; but this (away from the acting and some slick editing) is a cinematic mess!  When a movie exploring the life of one person throws up more questions for the viewer than answers, I think we've got ourselves a problem.  Muhammad Ali was one of the finest boxers of the 20th Century. Does this film tell us why he became a boxer?  NO.  Does it tell us what drove him so much as a boxer?  NO.  Does it even tell us how he really considered each victory and the occasional defeat?  NO.  He was a scandalous womaniser.  Do we find out why?  NO.  We just observe that he seemingly had to act like a slag.  Do we discover how this tallied with his deep Muslim faith?  NO.  We don't even discover WHY he was so desperate to have a deep Muslim faith!  (Despite the consternation of his family and no matter how flawed and selective he was about Islam's role in his life!!).  In short - it's FAQ off! (So to speak).  Anything you wanted to know about the title character of this film will not be on view for the entire, overlong duration of this film.My biggest unanswered bugbear though regards Ali's name change from Cassius Clay.  If it was purely a slave reason then surely all he needed to remove was the name Clay as that was the only association with some distant anaemic 'master'.  The name Cassius was a result of his Romanophile father.  How does that link to slavery?  Are you a slave if your parents dictate your name?  (This debate has a certain infinity about it...!!!)  Whatever.  The upshot is that this film tells us that the slave name - Clay - was removed first making him Cassius X and then the whole name was changed.  And unless you have a fluid understanding of the Islamic faith - this film never explains why!  Indeed, because Mann (et al!) decided that clever (and obtuse) cinematic collages were the key elements of this film in deference to any attempt at narrative, we learn precious little about what made Ali take most (if any) of his steps to glory and infamy.  In fact, by half-way into the film, you are left with the (surely unintentional) impression that Ali was an arrogant, bigoted, misogynist arse-hole who deserved any misfortune that came his way.  Brave film-making indeed!!??!!The vast majority of this confused picture is both morally and emotionally muddy.  Ali's romances suffer from a painful mixture of bad underwriting and way OTT pithy (and sadly, dirgy) soundtracks.  {Fans of black music may feel somewhat cheated here as the verging-on-racist soundtrack would seem to suggest that African American's have only ever written maudlin, self-pitying ballads.  Mann (or whoever!) seems to have suffered a blinkered amnesia when it comes to the likes of Chuck Berry; Jackie Wilson the Supremes et al. All contemporaries of Ali and all conspicuously absent in this film's mundane musicality.}  As to the writing.  It puts rubbish in the mouths of minor supporting characters {some spurious trash about Lennon being the only smart Beatle is incredible!} and soundbites in the mouth of it's lead. Virtually the only interesting things poor Muhammad seems to have to say for himself are in press conferences or in the ring; and sadly, these remain the film's only few highpoints.  The bouts are powerfully done and Ali's relationship with Howard Cosell [a knockout(!) Voight] give the film some rare and welcome warmth.  Likewise, a press conference with Don King [a wonderful Mykelti Williamson] and Angelo Dundee [a faultless but woefully underwritten and underused Ron Silver] provides Ali with his most solid show of humanity as he defends his training mentor (Dundee)against a typically robust King. It also sadly reminds us of another missed relationship opportunity. Instead, the film concentrates on an overstretched exposition of Ali's totally naive admiration for the notorious black leader, Malcolm X [a distinguished Mario van Peebles], a relationship which turns sour for the most unconvincing of reasons:  Namely, that Malcolm wanted to take a different direction from his Muslim overlords.  Clearly self determination was only something Ali was allowed.  (Frankly, I reckon the relationship was doomed as long as Malcolm hung on to his Western Christian name!).  As it is, Malcolm is portrayed as by far and away the better human being. Again. This cannot be the intention??  Michael??But what about Smith?  Well.  He's outstanding.  But he's given no help whatsoever by writer or director because - and this is the tragedy of it all - this is a whole lot of nothing movie!  It has no heart.  It attempts to show you it's trying it's hardest when we can all see the naked Emperor it really and truly is!  It's just a collection of soundbites and highlights. Handbags and gladrags.  It's a gross disappointment and not worthy of the name it purports to celebrate.Don't watch this film.",4,1,2,9 July 2002
Training Day," High Ranking Performances... Cop-Out Plot!
","LAPD Officer Jake Hoyt (Hawke) wants to make a difference on the streets, so he attempts to join the tough, harsh world of the plain-clothes Narcotics Department.  To succeed in this, he has to endure a training day on the job and convince the Narc's chief street officer, Detective Alonzo Harris (Washington), that he has what it takes.  A difficult enough job for anyone, but Detective Harris has one or two skeletons in his closet, and today they've all decided they're claustrophobic! Firstly.  The acting of the two leads is top-notch.  Washington might have won the Oscar for the showier part but Hawke matches him all the way in what is actually a more demanding journey.  90% of the movie concentrates on these two almost completely in isolation and they deliver through-out; a couple of moving, confrontational scenes at the heart of the film being exceptionally executed.Secondly.  The film does not have the courage of it's convictions. Initially it is almost plotless - and all the better for it.  Harris takes his rookie on a roller-coaster of 'street justice' and, despite the latter's consternation, the pivotal moments are so well handled and the dialogue of argument in the mouth of Harris so persuasive that his apparent immorality is never as clear-cut as it should be.  Had the entire film followed this path, we could well have been left with an intriguing debate on 21st Century urban justice and a refreshing reflection on the idea of 'right' and 'wrong'.  The film, of course, does nothing of the sort.  It's made in Hollywood after all!  No, almost exactly half-way through, we are introduced to a no-brainer plot involving the Russian mafia (oh dear!) and Harris stops breaking the rules because he firmly believes this is the only way to maintain street law, and starts breaking them because he is suddenly a very bad man!  Unbelievable plot twists follow hard by and we are taken into a different, disappointing, cliched nonsense of a film in which (among several lame developments) the residents of a lethal neighbourhood ghetto suddenly develop a collective, moral consciousness.  The very ending is awful beyond words and if it's a nod to Penn's Bonnie and Clyde it's an offensively crude one!It is to the two leads' credit than that, as crassly predictable as the film becomes, it remains very watchable because of their inspired playing.  And for that - it is worth a few hours of anybody's time.",7,0,11,19 August 2002
As Good as It Gets," Ineot romantic comedy.
","Curmudgeonly romantic novellist, Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson [sic!]) blames his rude disposition on his Obsessive Compulsive Disorder until he falls in love with put-upon waitress, Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt) who leaves him in no doubt that the way to her heart is via a complete change in his: and that means becoming friends with Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear); a struggling, gay artist on the brink of a nervous breakdown as a result of a vicious aggravated burglary.The above says it all really...  American producers have rarely been able to (and never will on the whole) distinguish between the sentimental and the false; and this movie is a beacon to such confusion.  Coming as it does from the pen of James L. Brooks - a man responsible for the joyously excellent 'The Simpsons' - this is a shoddily written, would-be screwwball comedy that never ceases to grate and is done precious little justice by either cast OR director.  How it garnered it's Oscars (or even it's nominations) is an enigma to me: Hunt is just above adequate; Nicholson is consistently below and Kinnear is as convincing as Hitler on a civil rights march.  Not one of the tragic circumstances is either convincing or believable and the denouement is infinitely more predictable than snow on the Alps.  As bad as it gets...",2,6,16,2 February 2001
MASH," Mistake In My Review Below...!!!
",Readers of even minimal intelligence will notice that I have written about the director Robert Aldrich below when I of course meant Robert ALTMAN.  No - it wasn't a test - it was because I am stupid...  Sometimes.  I apologise for any untoward stress I may have been the harbinger of.  Now please enjoy the review below remembering to substitute in the right director's name. Ta!,9,0,2,14 February 2002
MASH," What a cracking movie! Profundity WITHOUT coercion...!!!
","What with all the hoo-haw about Gosford Park and Aldrich being 'back to his best', I decided to sit through a re-run of MASH to see what all the fuss was about.  I'd seen it years ago and - to tell you the truth - I just didn't get it.  But now I'm older, wiser and - to certain myopic women - sexier: and I do get it...  I think!MASH is a 'simple' story of an American medical unit doing their utmost to survive their displacement to the Far East during the Korean War:  And it is excellent.Aldrich creates an anarchic environment based around two maverick, irreverent surgeons (Gould and Sutherland - both outstanding) in which war is viewed as an aberration not just because of the fatal cost to human life; but also (and equally) the prescient cost to everyday life!  That people have to forego natural pleasures and passions in order to extricate innocent people from political malaise.  As a satire it works wonderfully and almost appears apolitical.  It regards war as a pain in the posterior and in doing so profoundly highlights it's pathetic nature.  To say MASH is an anti-war film though is to totally miss the point.  MASH is an anti-authority movie and the blame for war is clearly placed (with constant doses of undiluted ridicule) at the feet of those in the various seats of power.To aid this 'apolitical' appeal, Aldrich utilizes a hilarious, ingenious and surreptitiously powerful script in harmony with a host of novel, enlightening and liberating cinematic devices (cross-over dialogue; distancing camera work; off-beat points-of view perspectives and an inspired end-credits device) which enable the actors to 'be' and not so much 'perform'.  This elicits an ensemble display of faultless believability in which there is ne'er a false note.Of the films many highlights along it's episodic narrative, mention must go to the collection of operating scenes (a quarter of a century before ER!) shot in perfectly believable detail and in which is anchored the 'horror of war' note; and the hilarious gridiron game which, despite it's potential (and surely many lesser director's temptation) to 'slapstick' out, remains firmly rooted in the land of truth and (perhaps because of this honesty) still manages to provoke uproarious laughter.MASH is a film that doesn't take it's subject too seriously.  What it does take seriously is the art of film-making (in all its composite forms) and because of this integrity, it never fails to be anything less than a courageous servant to the subject it espouses.  Oh that more films (especially about subjects like war and politics) could see the Hollywood for the trees!",9,0,2,6 February 2002
U-571," Potent history into bog-standard actioner.
","When an opportunity arises for a US Navy submarine to capture the Nazi's most potent weapon - The Enigma Coding Device - Lieutenant Tyrell (Matthew McConaughey) knows he, and his crew, cannot let the Allies down!Aside from the fact that the British Navy captured most of the pivotal Enigma information (a point ignored until a brief mention at the end of this so-so actioner), this film lets it's public down on several levels long before the truth!  Jonathan Mostow's bland attempt allows far too many good plot twists to dissolve (being hunted by another u-boat; having a captive German officer let loose on board the sub.; a conflict of interests between a sub. commander and a Marine Major [David Keith; killed off far too early!]) in place of a hackneyed, 'Destroyer chases sub.' drama in which - awfully predictably - the crippled sub. manages to sink the mighty destroyer with it's solitary torpedo!?!  Not that these action sequences aren't handled well; but when they're as unbelievable (and therefore as undeserved) as this, who cares?  The acting is as efficient as the film; that is to say - they do what what they can with an undemanding, profoundless script, and - at the end of it all - it becomes unfortunately apparent that we have discovered precious little about the nature of war and, tragically, even less about the nature of men under fire: Surely an unforgiveable flaw in a sub-genre as potent and as definitive as the submarine movie.  Then again, when you care more about flare-ups than facts, you're never really going to produce much else - are you?",4,0,1,4 February 2001
Seabiscuit," Indigestible & Very, Very Wet
","Seabiscuit is a film about three men down on their luck in depression riven America whose lives are turned around by a magical midget horse. Ahhh!What a tedious load of American pants!  The first half hour hints at an inspirational story, the remainder of the 2 hours-plus offers up an insipid diatribe.  I'm all for slow-burning in my cinematic experience but this stove frequently wasn't even lit!  Either have the testicles to do a 3 hour Epic Saga or the wherewithal to knock-out a 90 minute Greatest Hits: NOT a 2 hour 10 minute, inbetweenie, cover (patently too thinly) all posts!An excellent cast mugged by Hollywood's bodysnatching of gritty with bland. The most predictably cliched beyond repair cinematography you will EVER see. (From someone who must be a regular at 'Mountain Backdrops Anonymous'[Why is a 'loud, trash-movie' cinematographer doing this in the first place?]) Possessed, nodding horses in close-up not quite as possessed (OR NODDING) in long-shot.  And direction that becomes so pedestrian it should have a Mall erected around it.  Dull, dull, dull, dull, dull, dull, dull!If you liked this - check your pulse...",Null,0,1,26 March 2004
The Incredibles," The Inedibles
","Superheroes start upsetting normal people through their extraordinary talents (according to the press - a-la: X-Men/Spiderman) but the time comes around when the world needs them once more. Sadly there are only 5 superheroes left: 2 white adults (male and female); 1 black man and 2 children (male and female). And it is left to this PC example of the USA to save from destruction the... erm... city that looks like New York - but isn't. The white folk are The Incredibles and the black man is Frozone because black men are really cool.The animation on this film is as brilliant as any animation I have ever seen. That's my five points out of the way.The story, dialogue, clichés and 'morality' of this film are as crass as any I have ever seen.If you're still reading on I shall keep things to a minimum. Rejected youth becomes baddie. Yawn. Son of Incredibles (i.e. young child) is seen to celebrate when he kills off the 'bad guys'. Repellant. Daughter of Incredibles is awkward, rebellious teenager who wears her hair forward and covers her pretty face. In order to fulfill her 'super' duties she must wear it back. Her pretty face is revealed, she stops being rebellious and her dad likes it. And, of course, now she does too. Because there's nothing like killing off lots of baddies somewhere to make you realise you have to make the most of your good looks!!!!! And the film was only funny in three places. (Anything with the Rosa Klebb clone in).And the music was almost totally ripped-off from James Bond because, let's face it, that's what Brad Bird wanted to make but, because he didn't have the courage of his convictions, he added a thin, underdeveloped, 1 dimensional character 'story' about familial relationships which can convince no-one who actually has a family.This story is not about subduing the best or celebrating mediocrity. This story is about how killing lots of certain people is OK (whether you're a child or not) if your culture says it is OK and if your animation is brilliant. It has nothing to to with the Brothers Grimm or any dark fairy-tales. Sadly, I suspect it has too much to do with Brad Bird wanting to re-create an already popular adult franchise and market it at kids. Bad luck to him.And Toy Story 2 is one of my all time favourite films. Check it out for story, character, humour and morality.",5,2,8,3 May 2005
Mission: Impossible II," Overblown, Overlong and Tediously Predictable!
","A lethal virus called 'chimera' could potentially fall into the wrong hands, so Ethan Hunt must accomplish another Mission:Impossible to prevent this. But this time he's against his toughest enemy - an evil alter-ego who... Oh, who gives a damn!  It's already become predictably cliched and I haven't even mentioned the love triangle OR that Hunt is acting to avenge the murder of a mentor OR the repeated face changes which were disarming in Face Off and are anally convenient here...Look, there's no doubting Woo's credentials (and he was the only reason I rented this movie!) and the action sequences are impecably executed and frequently exciting.  Unfortunately however, they go on for far too long - just like the movie as a whole.  A prime example of this is the big fight at the end.  Now it may feature some stunning choreography but there really is such a dictum as 'too much of a good thing' and by the end (in fact, considerably before that) you really don't care who wins as long as somebody does and quickly.  And I won't even mention the farcical nature of the hero being hit flush in the face with a jagged rock and not bleeding as a result! Oops - I just did...For those M:I2 fans who would choose to delve into the defence that I 'don't understand Woo or his ballet of violence' - get real!  Woo's Hong Kong films were neither as pretentious as this and nowhere near the length.  They were taut, economical expressions of a specific cinematic discipline (choreographed screen violence/action) and they advanced that discipline appreciably.  The key word here though is economic.  When the money was tight in the old days - a little action had to say a hell of a lot: And it spoke volumes.  In M:I2 however the reverse philosophy applies and consequently the action scenes say far too much - very little of which is worth listening to.Finally - the narrative and dialogue of this film are frequently trite and superficial: And by that I mean the love story!  As unbelievable as 'Face Off' was, it was clear from the outset that it was all Woo's movie (Cruise's influence here is unfortunately heavy handed) and in Cage, Travolta and Allen he had performers of a far greater calibre than he has here; and consequently they could manipulate even the most ludicrous dialogue or plot developments and make them slightly more palatable: something beyond the key players here.  Which is particularly unfortunate considering Dougray Scott's potential gravitas wasted in a cliche riddled, one dimensional monster.  I mean, even Jean Claude van Damme doesn't pretend he's in Hamlet!In short: There's little here you haven't seen before and most of the stuff that's new frequently teeters on the edge of irritation.  Woo is NOT Ang Lee and he should steer well clear of romantic drama.  Even if he's being bankrolled by an over-reaching star who's clearly unaware of the law of diminishing returns.  And I mean art - not bank balance!  Because sometimes I like to think that that's the point!",5,0,1,15 February 2002
From Hell," As Illuminating As The Victorian Gas Lamp
","Inspector Fred Abberline (Depp) is thrust into the middle of his (nee' England's) most serious crime wave: Jack The Ripper.  He's a capable officer with a loyal assistant (Coltrane) but it's going to take more than guess work and intuition to crack this evil-nut.  Fortunately, Abberline is also gifted with special sight.  Unfortunately, it doesn't help prevent the murders.  Unbelievably, he falls in love with the prostitute at the head of the group seemingly on the Ripper's slash list:  Mary Kelly (Graham).  Can he prevent her demise?!  Are the Royal Family REALLY involved?!  Are the Juwes the ones who will not be blamed for nothing?!If you know nothing about the life and times of history's most celebrated serial killer then you will probably appreciate this well made, atmospheric thriller for the brooding fantasy feature it is.  Unfortunately, the more you know about the period of the Ripper, the less - proportionally - you will like about this film.  For starters, the theory at the heart of the plot has almost universally been either discretited or, at the very least, presented as unrectifiably flawed.  Secondly, Abberline's penchant for narcotics is (and always has been) highly debatable.  A difficult point to reconcile oneself with when it forms a rock-solid tenet of the movie's story.  And then there's the prostitutes:  Graham as Mary Kelly suffers from being at least a league prettier than the next whore (until Estelle Skornik's belated appearance), a red-head (when in reality blonde) and being burdened with a hybrid London/English accent bearing no element of her native Irish or her adopted Welsh (she lived in Cardiff until her early twenties)?  Likewise, 'Long' Liz Stride displays not a jot of her native Swedish accent despite only locating to England well into her mid twenties.
There are several other flaws which will niggle away at most viewers who possess even a slight knowledge of the murders.  But, so what?  It's a film. A piece of cinema.  It's not supposed to be true.  It's quite well made and (for the most part) reigns in it's cliches.  Depp invests a certain acting integrity and is supported, ably, by a stong British cast allowed to spout reasonably believable dialogue.  But it's not any greater than that.  And it DOES purport to be true.  All the characters existed and virtually all of them did what they did in the film.  So picking up on easily rectifiable flaws IS valid.  There are few things worse than lazy film making and - despite some tangible plus points - there is a veneer of sloppiness here which is sometimes difficult to see beyond.",5,2,4,2 July 2002
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," Ken'll Fix It For You.. And You.. And You..
","Dear Ken, Can you fix it for me (being of Irish decent) to see a film based on a pivotal chapter of Irish history done in a simplistic, clichéd, patronising, un-explained and one dimensional manner? Yours,Henfish xxx Dear Henfish, Now then, now then... What have we here? (Strange glottal noises) Well. We have fixed it for Henfish and The Wind That Shakes The Barley is that very film. We have removed any unsightly character development and left all emotional and dramatic scenarios as obvious and unchallenging as possible. To help this along we have made all the antagonistic characters exactly the same as one another in a helpful, one-dimensional fashion. Also - as your letter was so polite - we haven't lumbered you with any facts about the historical period in question. Instead, we have collated a large number of unbelievable soundbites (some refreshingly anachronistic), and peppered the entire film with them. This will hopefully confuse you to such a degree that you'll feel either overwhelming guilt and/or pride for the period in question and thus be blinkered as to the God awfulness of the actual project; failing, as it does, in every artistic area.Yours,Kenny Savey (rattle of jewellery... and almost empty head...)",2,13,27,26 February 2007
A Beautiful Mind," A Beauty Undermined
","Brilliant mathematician, John Nash (Crowe) becomes embroiled in counter espionage work in the Cold War peak '50's and his grip on reality takes a turn for the worst.  He is helped by the love of a good woman though...God awful ruination of a potentially revelatory story is woefully pithy; insensitively directed and features the worst Crowe performance since he hit Hollywood!  The dialogue is a collection of wannabe profound soundbites which convince neither as the musings of the characters saying them or as the deep aphorisms the writer mistakenly perceived he was educating us all with.  Howard's direction seems (almost purposefully) to miss the entire point that this should be a SUBTLE study of descent into and battling with madness.  Instead we see the Hollywood lexicon for what thick viewers will recognise as madness: Nash gets angry for no reason; Nash writhes and foams; Nash chases his own tail; etc...  And as pedestrian as Howard's non-functioning direction is - it isn't remotely helped by Crowe's interpretation of a tortured genius as: Spacker Camp!  Crowe's grossly offensive (clearly un-thought out) attempt to portray insanity as a man walking around with the initial symptoms of cerebral palsy and talking with an affected, pseudo-effeminate register is the stuff of notoriety.  This performance will come to haunt Crowe when right minded people wake up from their understandable reverie of rooting for the tortured soul and realise that a fine film is waiting to be made about John Nash and his tragic illness and this lame, gross affrontary is not it!",4,0,1,11 November 2002
The Thin Red Line," Please. Opinion is healthy and good - and it is allowed to be negative.
","Having already submitted a review for this flawed but noble film in February, I am drawn to make this addition as a result of those reviews posted by rabid fans who clearly seem unable to allow negative criticism (no matter how detailed, accurate or intelligent) to focus on THEIR film!  I am particularly incensed by bollocks relating to what Einstein may (or may not) have said regarding some fascistic argument that people who did not appreciate this film are, basically, inferior.  An argument perpetuated all too frequently throughout the reviews.  Bizarre really when you consider that war ordinarily exists because one race or nationality considers itself superior to another and yet, because people don't appreciate this anti-war film, they are classed as 'lessers' by those awarding themselves an intellectual superiority based on their grasp of one man's cinematic interpretation of a novel.  Be careful, this is where it all starts.
I don't doubt that negative reviews on this 'broad-church' website are frequently dubious and facile.  But so are many positive ones.  And no matter whether we disagree with another's opinion - we should never lose sight of being prepared to defend their right to voice it.  Unless, of course, you're reading this in North Korea.....",4,1,2,8 June 2002
The Thin Red Line," Oh Dear! If Mahler Made War Movies...
","The battle for the vital island of Guadalcanal.  If the American marines can take this strategic island they will have control of thousands of miles of air and sea territory!  But first they must overcome the fierce enemy without - and the painful enemy within!Please don't compare this with Saving Private Ryan.  Not if you think you have the first idea about cinema.  This is a totally different style and mood and historically different environment of film.  So don't make yourself look overly naive by making empty comparisons.  Ta.The Thin Red Line is an occasionally moving, consistently tedious, curiously uninvolving, overlong and over earnest film which stands as a confusion of performance art video and action picture.  The pithy score suggests a consistent profundity which is - ironically - battled against by a frighteningly flowery narrative and a plot which leaps far higher and more manically than the scores of possessed Japanese soldiers do when under close-arms attack! (E.g. Whatever happens to the limelight characters of John's: Savage and Cussack & how did we get from that meaningless jungle camp to the vitally strategic airfield - & many, many more...).  The action scenes are handled solidly enough and the performances (before they disappear without explanation!) are uniformly (!) superb.  (Nolte is spot on!  But what happens to him...!!!  Please!!!).  But, all in all, this is an uneven mess of a film which constantly forgets where it's going; what it's trying to say and - most importantly of all - who it's trying to save. (Should we fight?  Should we flight?  Are animals better than us because they're not the warring type?  Are the locals not the prime example of a perfect world in their constant summer bliss?  Could northern hemisphere people live like that despite the fact that they live in frozen climbs and it's not as idyllic and as verdant and a search for more fertile territory might lead to... but no!  This is about a war based on power and not survival so.. so.. how can I justify the constant close-ups of nature in peace.  Because nature is peaceful.  And universal.  And if people don't agree with, erm..  OK.  This, of course is not a perfect example of the entire world.  But it's representative.  Isn't it?  I got a very good degree you know...).  A case of: 'Why say one important thing clearly when you can attempt ten with little clarity?'.  An unfortunate prognosis of a director who had what he thought was a good thing - and attempted to feed us far too much of it!",4,1,2,28 February 2002
Goodfellas," Engrossing movie making with minor reservation(s)...
","I caught this terrific movie on TV again last night and, not for the first time, thought how wonderfully riveting this brilliantly directed and sublimely acted film is.  The dialogue never appears to hit a false note; the situations are frequently, sickeningly engrossing and the ensemble playing is as natural as breathing.  Yet it was whilst enjoying this latter part that I realised a potential flaw in this otherwise flawless gem: It dawned on me that - of the evil triumvirate at the heart of this film (Pesci [frighteningly superb]; De Niro and Liotta) - only Henry Hill (Liotta) is given the scope by writer and director to show any humanity throughout several of the story's more callous moments.  Is this because he was the only gangster with any humanity at the time of the Goodfellas?  (Possibly). Or is it perhaps because the film is based directly on his testimony (in which case - he would allow himself be occassionaly human in a world of unfeeling animals: wouldn't he?)?  Call me cynical, but watch for yourself. 
Anyway.  That's the only potential flaw.  That and the fact that, three quarters of the way in - as Liotta focusses on drug running - Scorsese decides to produce twenty minutes of a completely different style of movie! Oh, and Lorraine Bracco's bravura performance being shamefully underrated by far too many reviewers (which is, of course, not a flaw of the film!).  And finally the fact that, even though this film has existed for over a decade (and therefore the evidence that fine writing helps fine direction and fine direction helps fine acting and - NEVER! - these things altogether add up to classic cinema) Hollywood will still, on the whole, prefer to go for chaos over character and Janet and John dialogue over a literate script!  (One for the Brit's there!)",9,0,0,6 February 2001
