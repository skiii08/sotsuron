Skyfall," joker
","Apparently, reading the opinions of other people, you either love this movie or you hate it. I loved it. Although I would have preferred a more physical ending - a slug fest between Bond and Silva; I reckon I'm an old fashioned kind of guy. Javier Bardem played his part very well. I got the feeling that he read a lot of Batman comics and coated Silva with a lot of Joker. Craig was good, efficient. He's good in this kind of movie. But the ending suggested to me that after 3 heavy movies, they're going to go back to the lighter stuff. A male M, entering his office through the upholstered door, the banter with Moneypenny, Q, the barrel of the gun... I wonder if he'll be as good at this kind of Bond as Brosnan was. And was I the only one who kept thinking that the part of Kincade should have gone to Sean Connery?...",8,2,10,3 November 2012
Spider-Man," good, not great
","I've just seen 'Spider-Man'. Good, but not great. The first part of the movie I spent thinking 'yeah, yeah, I know all this' - how PP turned into Spidey, the wrestling bit, how his uncle got killed. That's the difference between this movie and that all time great comic book film 'Batman' - the story started right away. Everybody knows who Bruce Wayne is, how he came to be the Batman. So why loose 60 minutes telling it? Plus, there was so much more atmosphere to it. And all these memorable scenes. For me, there are only two in 'Spider-man': Norman Osborn talking to his reflection in the mirror, and aunt May saying the 'Our Father' when the Green Goblin attacks her and summons her to finish the prayer. On the plus side: great cast, good acting, spectacular action sequences. And yet, I somehow missed the delightfully wacky direction of Sam Raimy which made me like 'Darkman' and 'The Quick and the Dead' so much. As if Columbia reigned him in: this is a major motion picture and has to do well at the box office, so no experimenting with the direction. Style wise, Warner Bros. took a bigger chance with their super hero flick. To end on a positive note: as far as I could tell, there were no real holes in the script - something I can't say about my beloved Bats movie.",Null,0,0,14 July 2002
Moulin Rouge!," visual & musical treat
","I was sold on this movie when I saw the trailer. Unlike many other movies, I'm still sold on it now that I've seen it.  Kidman, McGregor and Broadbent were great, the rest of the cast adequate. The use of contemporary songs I liked a lot. Visually, it blew me away. So much so that half way through the movie, I started thinking 'Give this guy (Baz Luhrmann) a shot at a new Batman movie! He'd be perfect to succeed Tim Burton, and make everybody forget a certain Mr. Schumacher.'",Null,0,1,14 October 2001
