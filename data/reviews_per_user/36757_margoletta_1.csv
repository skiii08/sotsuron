The Ring," c'mon guys, what more do you want?
","I've read some of the 'not scary' comments - please!  What more do you want? This movie kept me on the edge of my seat but I went into the theater with the expectation of 'suspending my disbelief'.  If you're going to sit and pick the movie apart, then why pay the $7?  Once you're into the plot, into the characters, into the movie, you'll agree...this was one creepy flick. And if you never even 'jumped', you might be dead already---",9,0,0,3 November 2002
