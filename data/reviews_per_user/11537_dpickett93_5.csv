The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," The Dark One In The Bunch
","Every franchise has that one film that has a very dark, somber tone to it and that's exactly what 'Mockingjay: Part 1' became. I personally only had one issue with the film that isn't a huge deal. I thought the film should have been two hours and an extra forty-five minutes. It just seemed like one of those films. As the franchise gets closer to the end I would think that each film would get longer to make sure everything that needs to be in the film is in it. But that didn't affect the rating that I gave it. Solid, good film. It went places that it didn't go in the first two a little which is always nice and fresh for franchises like this. Let's be honest here though. Critics and Metascore can give this whatever color grade or number they want, the film is still gonna bring in big revenue.",8,11,36,27 November 2014
Gone Girl," Dave Fincher, Early Lead.
","I'm not a well-known film critic but this is my first film that I have gave a ten out of ten rating. We all know that it's that time of the year again for production companies to start pumping out their best material for the Academy Award season. Some companies think their is a system to putting together a great film. Other companies actually take the time to put together a great film crew and good actors. This was one of those companies. Consider this film a headstart on David Fincher's race to an award for Best Director, or Best Picture either one is fine. Everything about this film is almost perfect to the directing, editing, acting, even the font for the credits.",10,2,14,5 October 2014
Frozen," The First Modern Disney Classic
","Is there such a thing as a modern classic? This film hit all the points in why Disney was created by the late great Walt Disney. It gives you all emotions. Nowadays Pixar tries too hard and misses sometimes on films they mostly do well because it's Disney but this brings it back to what it is suppose to be. It gives all the emotions of suspense, romance, comedy, thrilling and other. I don't think Pixar was apart of this film though. I never saw a short before it started or never saw the classic bouncing lamp. Maybe Disney will realize something here. Maybe Pixar focuses on modern stories when Walt Disney Studios focuses on the magical, fantasy part. Great family film.",10,4,13,22 March 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Leonardo Dicaprio is so underrated
",I feel so sorry for Scorsese and DiCaprio. All the hard work and money that was put into this great film that was only nominated twice in the Golden Globes and as far as I saw rarely in the Academy Awards. I have seen (and own) just about every Oscar-nominated film of 2014 and I have to say 'The Wolf of Wall Street' (which is a comedy) is a wonderful film and once again one of Scorsese's best work. I love that the film was basically 3 hours. It took me on a real adventure about the life of Jordan Belfort. 'American Hustle' did not have enough comedy to become the best in a category with 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. Leonardo DiCaprio once again is snubbed of another Academy Award but he seems so humble and loves his work so much that he just wants to produce go material. All an all the film is perfect. This is my first film rating of 10 out of 10 which I never give.,10,1,7,1 April 2014
Lucy," Almost There Lucy
","We all know Luc Besson and his style of directing. Lucy had some action in but just not enough for me. It seemed like right when I got comfortable the movie was over. The movie is only 1hr and 28mins but that is plenty of time. Since the movie started out with the plot I thought, 'Great, that means plenty of time for action', and I feel like it just wasn't enough. Just a tad more would've been fine. But the film is decent. Glad I used my free movie ticket for it though. The fact that it made way more than 'Hercules' and that film cost over double of 'Lucy' lets you know something. The rest of this review is just to have enough lines for it to go through.",6,0,10,27 July 2014
