Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I've seen it once, and it's already a favorite of mine.
","I don't know what the critics were thinking when they reviewed Episode One (assuming they actually *saw* the film). I already think it's the best of the four existing movies, and I can't wait for Episodes II and III.  I thought the special effects were great, and the sound was the best, especially during the podrace!  The lightsaber fights were THE best ever in all of the movies.  Kudos to Ray Parker for his performance during those fights.  I thought the acting was good too, despitewhat the critics said.  You don't see the first 3 films being nominated for acting awards, do you(with the exception of Alec Guinness)?  Overall, it doesn't matter if the acting, story, or effects are great, but whether you *enjoyed* watching it, and Episode One is no exception, it being extremely fun to watch.",10,0,0,21 May 1999
