Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Don't see Borat
","This movie was a complete waste of time. The gags were so over-the-top that they were disgusting, and not funny. I didn't find Borat's returning from the bathroom, carrying his own human waste in a plastic bag to the dinner table and handing it to the hostess to be amusing; equally disgusting was his naked brawl with his fat old hairy companion, during which his fat partner's butt was in Borat's face as they simulated gay sexual positions. The movie dragged on for what seemed like an agonizingly long period of time. Add to this the ridiculously exaggerated anti-Semitism, and this movie had all the marks of one that I regret having seen. I saw a free preview showing of this movie, and I would have been angry if I had paid to see it. Even so, it was not worth the hour I waited in line to see it.",1,18,60,31 October 2006
