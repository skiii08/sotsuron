Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The worlds most expensive commercial
","This film should have been the greatest of all time, it had everything going for it. A huge budget, a great storyline, already well established in the public eye and 20 years to work on it. What I cannot understand is why George Lucas felt he needed to create a film that was designed purely to sell merchandise. He has no need for the money so WHY? The result of all this is a third rate kids film. Yes it has great special effects but it does not make up for the complete absense of plot, structure and characterisation. I can find very little by way of good things to say about this film, and I hold little hope for the next two movies either, I just hope that the money Lucas made from selling Ja Ja Binks lunch-boxes makes up for the total loss of respect from every true star wars fan out there.",4,1,2,7 April 2001
Meet the Parents," Could do better
","This film is a based on a great concept, that should have spawned some really funny moments, but despite its quality cast I felt that many opportunities were wasted. That said, there are moments where you will laugh, just not enough. Meet The Parents is an enjoyable film that is worth watching and could have been much better if just a little more time had been spent on improving the script.",6,1,2,31 March 2001
2001: A Space Odyssey," Am I missing something?
","I tried to watch this film years ago, but gave up after half an hour through extreme boredom. Recently I tried again, and made myself sit through the entire thing. I kept thinking that something might actually happen soon, but no. This is one of the most over-rated and tedious films I have ever seen, and I can only assume that the people who have rated it so highly were stoned at the time.",2,13,26,27 March 2001
