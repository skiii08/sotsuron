The Incredible Hulk," It's a good year for superhero movies
","Out of the five original Avengers, I always thought that the Incredible Hulk was the least interesting and therefore least likely character to be adapted to film (except Ant-Man, although he'll be arriving in 2010...look forward to that.) However, here we sit in 2008 with not just one, but TWO different portrayals of the less-than-jolly green giant. The main problem that the new film faces is that some people will believe it to be a sequel to Ang Lee's 2003 effort, which upon release was blindfolded, made to stand against a wall and executed by public firing squad. The fact is that it is not a sequel at all. Instead, director Louis Leterrier has pulled a 'Batman Begins' and rebooted the franchise, and not just in name only. Everything about the 'Hulk is excellent. From the special effects to the characters to the reticent nods to other superheroes within the Marvel universe, the 'Hulk succeeds on every level.The film sidesteps the curse of the tedious 'origin story' by showing it to the audience in the opening credits. That should really be a law within superhero movies. It works so well: Bruce Banner works on a radioactive serum with love interest/scientist Betty Ross (played by Liv Tyler's lips), he injects himself to see if it works, it transforms him into the Hulk. There, that didn't need to take one hundred minutes of screen time did it? This means that director Leterrier has free reign to explore how Bruce Banner lives as the Hulk and the attempts by the United States army to track him down and neutralise him, which leads to several action set pieces involving vehicles being thrown into walls and soldiers firing a nimiety of bullets at the Hulk, even when they can clearly see them bouncing off his body. Really, what is the best they are hoping for in a situation like that? 'Keep firing, he might develop a vague sense of moral ill-being and stop!' Ultimately, the film boils down to a brawl in New York City between the Hulk and his evil counterpart, a special-ops soldier (Tim Roth being exemplary as usual) willingly injected with the Hulk genes, much like the climax to 'Iron Man.' The difference here is that the build up to this fight doesn't seem rushed like in 'Iron Man' because Leterrier has been able to utilise the whole of the film's running time to arrive at this natural conclusion, instead of being preoccupied with the origin story and tagging on an antagonist at the end.Whoever cast Edward Norton as Dr Bruce Banner is almost as much of a genius as the person who asked Robert Downey Jr. To play Tony Stark in 'Iron Man' (who makes an appearance in the film inducing fan-boy erections everywhere.) Norton plays his role with understated finesse, never resorting to overly pained facial expressions, intense eye contact or shouting to display the anguish which is consuming him for the majority of the film. He simply shows that the Hulk sized burden on his back is destroying him, crushing his will to live. He looks haunted and tired, but possesses a steely resolve not to succumb to the beast within, although it would temporarily end his struggle if he did so. He's so good that Christian Bale will have to turn water into wine in The Dark Knight to retain his title as King of the Superheroes (Tobey Maguire? Hahaha, you're kidding...wait, you aren't?) There are many minor elements in 'The Incredible Hulk' that elevates it above most movies in this genre. For example, for nearly half of the film the audience are only provided with fleeting glimpses of the Hulk, much like Batman in 'Begins. His presence is not overused, though it easily could be with the bravura CGI shown at the end. Indeed, the first chase scene does not involve Banner turning into the Hulk at all, it is just an exciting pursuit across rooftops in Rio De Janeiro. Also, the orchestral score lends an air of intelligence to the film and enhances the scenes much more than an overdriven guitar track (hello, Iron Man) would have done.The Incredible Hulk is one of those minority superhero films; it's good. In fact, with regard to any competition it faces, you (if you were looking to conclude a film review with a dialogue related pun) might be inclined to say 'Hulk smash!'",7,5,8,15 June 2008
3:10 to Yuma," 'I hate posses.'
","For some, including me, this film represents a dream pairing of two of the greatest living actors of our time in a set up ensuring 117 minutes of deftly delivered dialogue and widespread death and destruction. The result: the most rewarding Western since Clint Eastwood's 1992 Unforgiven. The pace is relentless; no sooner does the film begin than we are introduced to Christian Bale's perpetually stepped on protagonist being attacked by the railroad and Russell Crowe's 'Darth-Vader-there's-still-good-in-you' villain mercilessly holding up a stage coach. Between Crowe's Ben Wade being captured and Bale's Dan Evans eventually delivering him to the eponymous 3:10 to Yuma there are several graphic gunfights, each as memorable as the last, which actually serve to enhance the plot rather than occur solely to keep the attention of the audience. These action set-pieces (of which the finale could rank alongside The Wild Bunch in terms of violence) are interspersed with Evans and Wade's psychologically fought battle against one another, Crowe's character seemingly fascinated with Bale's, needling him and forcing him to take charge throughout. Evans responds in kind by using this as an opportunity to show his son, having long since lost his sense of hero worship towards his invalidated father, that he has the courage to step up to the task at hand when nobody else will. Bale plays this part with an understated excellence, never piling on the dramatics or attempting to emotionally sucker punch the audience, and this is why Yuma works so well. This is also a reason why any film with Christian Bale in has to be worth a look.In regard to secondary characters, Ben Foster proves once again that he is more than capable of playing the psychotic right hand man without hamming it up (see Hostage) and portrays his character's borderline obsession with Wade admirably. He also receives the best dialogue. Peter Fonda plays Byron McElroy, another term for 'total bad ass.' When he takes a bullet in the stomach he doesn't wimp out like a certain black-suited, skinny-tied undercover policeman crying and bleeding like a wuss, he goes to the doctor, gets the bullet removed WITHOUT MAKING A SOUND and saddles up to lead the posse taking Ben Wade to Yuma. That's what real men are made of. The doctor who accompanies McElroy to make certain he's OK (as if he needs any help) is very formulaic, being reduced to committing a single act of spontaneous violence in order to help the gang and subsequently boasting about it moments before being killed, but not before uttering something like 'We made it, didn't we?', a line taken straight from the Clichéd Book of Screen writing, Volume One. Evans' son is played with professional maturity by Logan Lerman, whose character, in the wrong hands, could have ruined every scene he appeared in. Instead he is an asset to the cast, allowing the audience to easily identify with his character.Criticism to the film mainly appears in the form of a recurring horse noise, recognisable from the PC game Age Of Empires 2. While it may be sad to pick up on this, there is no excuse for using this identical sound of horses whinnying at no less than FOUR different points in the film. How hard is it to record the sound of a couple of horses making noises? It is the horse version of a Wilhelm Scream, lazy and irritating. Additionally, the capture of Wade at the start following his totally unnecessary rendezvous with a bar woman is a little contrived, as if the filmmakers could not imagine any other way Wade could be detained. Finally, the presence of the 'cursed pistol' serves no purpose to the story whatsoever.Overall, Yuma is a magnificent Western brought to life by star turns from several actors bringing enough depth and emotion to their characters to balance out the fact that 'They had a lot of weapons, Mister - and they were shooting bullets.'",8,1,3,7 November 2007
Kung Fu Panda," 'You wanna go see Kung Fu Panda?' '....Yes.'
","Since the explosion of computer generated animation onto the big screen in recent years, Dreamworks has been the main perpetrator in overexposing the world to the genre. For every brilliant, nurtured and expertly crafted Pixar creation there is a lazy Dreamworks equivalent, heavily relying on pop culture references and famous voice talent to disguise the fact that the films suck. Yes, I'm including Shrek in this. It is a bad movie and after just seven years looks ridiculously dated. So what does any of this have to do with Kung Fu Panda? Well, because somehow Dreamworks have managed to perform a complete U-turn in their thinking and release an animated movie that isn't just good, it is excellent. I say 'somehow,' although it doesn't take William James Sidis to realise that when Pixar are receiving ten times more critical and commercial acclaim than you are, following their blueprint for success might just be a good idea.So what is detailed on this blueprint? A good storyline for a start, which in Kung Fu Panda is essentially Star Wars without the stars. A Panda named Po dreams of becoming a martial arts master whilst stuck in his day job at the noodle restaurant (which, you know, is so indicative of Chinese culture.) He gets his shot when Yoda makes Obi-Wan Kenobi take Po as a padawan and train him in the ways of the kung fu force just in time to combat the evil Darth Vader, who has recently escaped from a prison staffed entirely by rhinos and is looking to exact bloody vengeance on his former master and rule the Chinese galaxy. Except in this case Yoda is a tortoise named Oogway, Obi-Wan is...something called Shifu and Vader is a snow leopard named Tai Lung. Additionally, there are five other martial arts masters, the legendary Furious Five (a tiger, a crane, a mantis, a viper and a monkey), who were trained by Shifu and do not take kindly to Po's intrusion into their perfectly balanced lives. Intersperse this with several scenes of ass kicking seemingly lifted from Jackie Chan's 'Legend of the Drunken Master' and you have one potent recipe for success.However, the characters must be interesting and likable for the story to work. Thankfully they all are. From the initial dream narration of Jack Black's eponymous panda (his first truly funny role since 'School Of Rock') through to the final scene, the excellent voice work coupled with the stellar animation brings each and every character satisfyingly to life. Stand-outs include Dustin Hoffman as master Shifu, Ian McShane, who introduces a sense of dignity into Tai Lung not consistent with bad guys in children's films, and Randall Duk Kim as Oogway, who receives some of the funniest lines. He also pulls the best facial expressions.The only problem with Kung Fu Panda is the relative under-utilisation of the Furious Five. Here we have characters voiced by the likes of Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu and David Crane and they are not really given enough chances to speak at all. Jackie Chan's Monkey, for instance, has about three lines of dialogue. Also, aside from their fantastic fight scene against Tai-Lung, they have little to do. This is clearly something to be exploited for the inevitable sequels, unless the whole word goes mental and decides to see Shrek 4 in record numbers, prompting parts 5 to 8 to be rushed into production instead of KFPII. Luckily, the world will then explode from the sheer irrationality of that event ever happening, so we'll never have to see them.Basically, Dreamworks have produced a movie that both fans and people that intensely dislike their studio will enjoy. Sure, it probably won't be as rewarding as Pixar's Wall-E but who cares? As master Oogway says, 'Quit, don't quit. Noodles, don't noodles.' Think about that one. Or don't.",8,3,5,29 June 2008
Inglourious Basterds," Better than Death Proof. But then so is every other film.
","The problem with Inglourious Basterds is that it's rubbish. Two and a half hours of rubbish. All the ingredients are there for it to be a minor classic on the scale of, say, In Bruges, but these ingredients never add up to the correct amounts. Sure, there is humour, but it's usually incredibly obvious (yeah you, Brad Pitt.) Yes, there is violence, but much of it is reduced to gore shots so prevalent in all horror films at the moment they have no shock value. Then there's the myriad of characters who typically populate Tarantino films but who, in Inglourious Basterds, are never explored beyond a name and an accent. Finally there are the numerous homages that Tarantino shoehorns into every scene because he wants everybody to know what his influences are. However, when a homage consists of imitating Sergio Leone's extreme close up shot technique and replacing Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach with some German guy and Eli goddamn Roth, the effect is somewhat underwhelming. I mean, when you see the director of Hostel I and II emerge from a pitch black tunnel with a baseball bat in hand, ready to smash some guy's head in with it, you're not exactly thinking, 'Wow, this certainly evokes the same kind of tension the original did. And the same Morricone score is being used! I may start clapping at the screen when the film ends.'Some elements do work. The chapter sequences, ripped bodily from the 120 Days of Sodom, are a nice touch. The decision to film half the scenes auf Deutsch was quite brave and far more interesting to watch than Germans speaking in English together with German accents. Tarantino's film-within-a-film, Nation's Pride, was clever as it showed what could have happened to Inglourious Basterds if he'd written it as a typical war film. The audience of Nation's Pride are entirely desensitised to the excessive violence on screen because it is occurring constantly; by contrast, when Inglourious Basterds finally erupts into a maelstrom of shooting, explosions and death, the audience greets it with repugnance. Clever, I think. Finally, the element that works the most, and furthermore almost single-handedly succeeds in overcoming the film's general disposition to be as mediocre as possible, is Christopher Waltz. Not only does he speak fluent German, English, French and Italian, but he also has a gargantuan chin. And he gave a rather puissant performance as a not very nice human being.What I found most infuriating about Inglourious Basterds was the amount of acting talent Tarantino had to use but chose not to instead. Daniel Brühl, for instance, is relegated to the role of 'plot device.' The only character development he is given is the definitely not contrived 'I seem nice, but when I don't get what I want I become a whiny bitch.' Til Schweiger faces slightly different difficulties. What's the point in giving him a back-story if the back-story is going to be his only story? 'Check out what this guy did! Now's he dead! Next!' Brad Pitt is also wasted. Who asked him to speak like that? Why is he in about six scenes? Not even six cool scenes, just six dull ones (cept wen hez speekin Italian amirite?!). Michael Fassbender is the other one who is criminally underused. Instead of having a revenge story about a Jew girl that nobody cares about, it would have been infinitely more beneficial to follow the exploits of Lieutenant Overtly British. On a related note, why did Tarantino feel as though he had to include Mike Myers showing off his one-note acting abilities and why have him attempting an English accent in the presence of Fassbender, whose own accent could be the archetype for all future English person impressions? Myers just looks and sounds retarded. No different than usual then. Zing.To conclude this pointless essay, Inglourious Basterds has everything that could make a film great, but is assembled in such a way as to appear only half thought-out. As Colonel Landa says, 'Wait for the cream.' We're waiting. Where is it?",4,9,21,4 September 2009
Coffee and Cigarettes," A coffee pot of ideas. Like a melting pot but with a crappy pun.
","Having only seen one other Jim Jarmusch film, the understated 'Broken Flowers' (2005), I was not entirely sure what to expect from Coffee and Cigarettes. Composed over nearly a twenty year period, Jarmusch offers eleven captivating snapshots into the lives of a multitude of quirky characters connected only by the leitmotif of the eponymous title. Unique for C&C is that every character is referred to by their real-life name, with most playing exaggerated versions of themselves (Bill Murray, Meg and Jack White, Steve Coogan, Alfred Molina, RZA, GZA, Iggy Pop, Tom Waits) and others (Cate Blanchett, Isaach de Bankolé, Alex Descas, Renee French, William Rice, Roberto Bengini, Steven Wright) bringing to life intriguing individuals that you actually want to find out more about. This is where the appeal in C&C lies, in that the audience can use the segments to speculate on why these people are meeting for coffee (or, in two exceptions, tea), what has happened beforehand and what will happen to them once they leave. For example, why is Renee French, in the segment 'Renee' sitting on her own drinking coffee whilst reading a catalogue about handguns and hunting knifes? Perhaps she is an assassin, enjoying a moment of peace and clarity before she murders somebody across the street. What is left unsaid between Alex Descas and Isaach de Bankolé in 'No Problem?' Why, as best friends, have they not seen each other for two years? Why is Bill Murray hiding in a coffeehouse? For what reason are Iggy Pop and Tom Waits meeting each other 'Somewhere in California?' Does William Rice seem to pass away at the end, or merely fall asleep? Questions like these are purposely raised throughout C&C but are never answered. It's rather scintillating stuff, and much has to be left to the imagination. It is also rather amusing stuff. There is always an underlying sense of awkwardness between the characters in each segment which constantly threatens to boil over, leading to both parties usually unintentionally insulting the other and one making an excuse to leave. The best example of this is in the aforementioned 'Somewhere in California' segment, where Iggy Pop seems to constantly fall foul of a laconic Tom Waits ('You think I need a drummer? What, so I'm not good enough to do it myself?') Another good example is in the segment 'Cousins', where two polar opposite cousins, one a successful film star, the other a free spirit and both played exceptionally well by Cate Blanchett, share an uncomfortable ten minutes envying each others' lifestyles before the movie star cousin is summoned away ('Maybe I'll get to meet Lou next time!' 'His name is Lee.') A final highlight (there are many to choose from) is the representation of Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan as two extremely English stereotypes, with Molina as the gracious, polite and slightly bumbling gentleman and Coogan as the sarcastic, uninterested fop ('He's a very committed environmentalist.' 'Spike Jonze is a tree hugger? Jesus, I never would've had him down as that.' 'Well... I think he prefers the term 'leaf people.'') There are only a couple of misfires in C&C and these lie in the ostentatious 'Jack shows Meg his Tesla Coil' and 'Delirium' segments. They do not seem to fit with the other stories. There is no intrigue or wonder. Whereas the other segments had an element of realism about them, these two feel overtly artificial and forced. It does not help that for 'Jack Shows Meg...', neither Meg nor Jack White can act. They should have just played a song for five minutes instead. Also, in Delirium, despite having one of the greatest living actors, Bill Murray, his setup is so far removed from the other shorts that it seems like some kind of Saturday Night Live sketch (No way! Bill Murray talking to the Wu-Tang Clan dressed as a waiter and drinking straight from the pot. Mental!) It's a shame because 'Broken Flowers' shows how well Jarmusch employed Murray to give a fantastic, yet modest performance. To conclude, Coffee and Cigarettes is a veritable treasure trove of characters, ideas and implications which should find resonance in some form or another with anybody, but if you're reading this and shaking your head don't worry; you're probably just a Taco Bell kind of guy.",8,0,1,11 December 2007
Juno," I do try hard to be cool
","OK, get this. Juno was written by a lady called Diablo Cody. How cool is that? That's got to be one of the coolest names of all time (after Max Power of course.) It's a shame she didn't channel her coolness into the film's script, which, though charming and fuzzy and consistent, doesn't exactly go for the jugular. Juno tells the story of a sixteen year old girl named Juno MacGuff, played by the breathtakingly beautiful and rather talented Ellen Page, who finds herself pregnant after enjoying spontaneous sex with her best friend. Her eventual course of action is to put the baby up for adoption and soon finds the seemingly perfect couple, Vanessa and Mark Loring (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman, respectively.) However, and this came as a total shock, things don't all go to plan and Juno finds herself reassessing the situation and her life in general. Now, everybody knows that this type of film (Zach Braff's Garden State also instantly springs to mind) involves a dramatic event prompting the protagonist to meander their way through the film and eventually learn a valuable life lesson, all the while accompanied by an indie-based soundtrack. That is not important. What IS important are the things occurring around the story and for the most part Juno gets it right. The majority of the characters are quirky and funny, the highlights being the eponymous heroine and Bleeker (Michael Cera), the guy responsible for getting Juno in the pudding club, so to speak. Their actions and dialogue may not elicit spasmodic fits of laughter but they are responsible for placing the smile on your face which remains from beginning to end. Plus, I found myself actually caring about Juno's plight. Director Jason Reitman does not shy away from the subject matter (good job too, because he'd have little else to work with) and avoids making the mistake of asserting that teenage pregnancy is funny. The jokes are made parallel to the pregnancy, not at the expense of it. For example, at one point Juno is visiting the prospective adopting couple, staying a while when Vanessa suggests that she should be returning home on account of her parents worrying about her, to which Juno replies: 'Nah... I mean, I'm already pregnant, so what other kind of shenanigans could I get into?' It's sentences like that that make Juno a worthwhile film experience.However, there were a few elements which, though inoffensive enough on their own, when combined over the 96 minute running time annoyed the hell out of me. Why do independent productions always have to have title credits that look like they were designed by somebody who failed to gain entry into art school (Hitler, for example)? And always with the Red House Painters guitar pop played over the top. It doesn't look or sound good. The music all the way through was pretty bad actually, especially the frequent name-dropping conversations between Juno and Mark to firstly show how much of a cool guy Mark is and secondly to show just how damn quirky Juno really is. Mentioning Sonic Youth and/or the late seventies punk movement will never earn you any esteem. Also, the burger phone was irksome. It isn't enough that it appears several times; it has to get a mention too, as though we haven't noticed it. 'Oh, sorry I'm on my burger phone, it doesn't work very well.' Yes, great. We can see you have a phone shaped like a quarter-pounder, NEXT.Although Juno does try its hardest to feed the audience a novelty communication device, it is one of those films people should watch now and again to confirm that they are not indeed emotionally dead but are actually still able to remember what happiness, however faint, feels like. Ellen Page seems like a lady who would be cool just to hang out with, the dialogue is intelligent and snappy, a Gibson Les Paul makes a welcome appearance and, of course, the ending is the equivalent to swallowing a tablespoon of sugar while swimming in a bath of syrup. You cannot go wrong.",7,36,75,21 January 2008
Yes Man," We all prefer your serious roles, Mr Carrey
","With a Jim Carrey comedy you know what to expect, namely facial expressions and funny noises being emitted from a man who, at forty-six years old, should possibly know better. Yes Man employs these qualities to their fullest extent throughout in a vain attempt to hide the fact that the plot is essentially non-existent and merely consists of a bunch of non sequiturs whose only connection is Captain Malleable doing his magical face changing trick in each of them. But whatever. As long as Carrey is allowed to shout things like 'I've got blisters on my fingers!' in Ringo Starr's voice, some source of enjoyment can always be gleaned from Yes Man's lifeless, decaying corpse.The story involves Carrey's protagonist Carl Allen, a banker who lives alone, spends his free time watching endless DVDs, shuns his friends and says no to every offer that comes his way. After attending a self-help seminar, Allen then decides to say yes to every offer that comes his way. Who saw that coming? Even more unbelievably, his saying yes to everything leads to him meeting a girl and they both fall in love. And he gets a promotion. And everybody thinks he's great, even though he's essentially lying to everybody. It's all so fresh. I can only assume the screenwriters took Danny Wallace's original novel, read the synopsis, possibly urinated on it before throwing it in the bin, laughed, and then set about writing their own screenplay based on the last film they'd both recently seen and thought the world needed more of, which was Bruce Almighty. Thanks guys.The only actor who actually seems like they're having a good time is Rhys Darby, who plays Carl's boss, Norm. Sure, he might be an imitation of David Brent, but considering the screenwriters enjoy reusing ideas so much they managed to weave a whole film out of doing this, at least with Norm they stole an idea which is funny. However, they don't stop there. Later in the film, Norm holds a party which, in its execution is such a blatant rip-off of Rick Moranis' gathering of his neighbours in Ghostbusters that I'm sure Moranis is probably spinning in his grave. If he were dead. Which he isn't. Other than Norm, the only character worth remembering is the love interest, Allison, who isn't memorable because of anything she does (Oh look! She's quirky! Look at her running and photographing! Only Juno is quirkier!), but rather because she's played by Zooey Deschanel, who may or may not be an angel. Any scene she is in goes some way to alleviating the hebetude the film tries so hard to induce, and in particular the ones where she wears the cutest faux-military jacket in the world.Of course, if you don't happen to like Zooey Deschanel then you're a little stuck. You may take comfort in seeing a 78 year old woman remove her dentures moments before engaging in oral sex with Carrey, which is possibly the highlight of his career after anything else he's ever done, including the Cable Guy. Solace may also be found in an excruciatingly lengthy fight scene between a 'drunk' Carrey (hello silly voice/funny face combination) and a muscle-bound cliché. Happily, it never seems to end, allowing one pun after another to fall flat on its face while the audience watches on reticently, kind of like slowing down to see a car crash.In all, Yes Man is only offensive in the sense that it doesn't try at all to create something even slightly original, choosing instead to rely on tried and tested mediocre formulas in order to deliver a mildly amusing diversion for an audience that will forget the film the moment they leave the theatre. So, while Carl Allen would unequivocally say yes to the question, 'Do you want to go and see Yes Man?', I know that he's really thinking 'No, obviously not.'",4,6,21,16 December 2008
The Bourne Ultimatum," Extreme in so many different ways
","The best trilogy of all time? Let us compare Bourne to other prolific movie threesomes. Star Wars? Nope, Bourne triumphs because it doesn't slap the audience in the face with a homosexual teddy dance to the strains of a John William's reject dance number at the end. The Godfather? I guess if Sofia Coppola hadn't stuck her giant nose into the third part then maybe, though even then the final instalment was not consistent with the other two. Die Hard? I always feel let down that 'Vengeance had to lower itself to join the ranks of the at-the-time burgeoning Buddy Cop genre in order for it to succeed. Indiana Jones? You've got to admit, Temple of Doom was crap. The Lord of the Rings? It is far too long. Leone's Man with no Name trilogy? No, simply due to the ridiculous, overdubbed prospector in the second part, who takes it upon himself to attempt to single-handedly destroy the bad-ass Western genre with a five minute Benny Hill routine. So, in conclusion, does Bourne represent the best trilogy of all time? No. The other films NOT mentioned in the trilogies above more than make up for their lacklustre cousins and stand head and shoulders above anything a buffed-up Matt Damon can offer. However, Bourne is indeed the most consistently rewarding. Ultimatum does not disappoint and in fact is probably the most entertaining of the three. Whereas audiences for 2002's Identity had to tolerate Franka Potente throughout and 2004's Supremacy was so up its own ass it would never see daylight again, 2007 seems to be the perfect year for Robert Ludlum's amnesiac assassin.The strengths are numerous: a strong performance by Damon (as usual), a good supporting cast (chameleon actor Paddy Considine appears as an unfortunate Guardian newspaper journalist), realistic feeling action scenes and stunts (Bourne versus Desh), non-trite dialogue (Supremacy was full of it) and a bass-heavy soundtrack by John Powell which fits the film perfectly. A particular asset of Ultimatum is its total attention to detail; it feels as though Bourne is a real person living in the world and director Paul Greengrass just happened to be fortunate enough to capture all his movements on film (which would account for the overabundance of the shaky-cam technique...if it was real.) The use of different languages adds to this effect. The product placement does not feel forced, nor does it repeatedly smash the audience round the head with 'Look at ME! I'm Staples, the superstore! Come to Staples! Staples rocks!' In terms of weaknesses there are a couple of points that stand out. Why does Bourne feel as though he has to reveal to the CIA head that he is in his office, thereby making it several times more difficult for him to escape the premises than it would have been had he just said 'Oh you're in your office? I'm in McDonalds. Yeah I know, the burger never looks like it does in the picture.' Is it some sort of ego trip? 'Yeah, I'm in your office, I outwitted you once again. Come and get me.' He's like Macauley Culkin in Home Alone. The other problem is that some of the film feels like a retread of the first two instalments. I realise that this is intentional in places, but the cracks are beginning to appear in Bourne's otherwise perfect facade.In conclusion, please do not destroy the trilogy and make a fourth film, you money-hungry Hollywood producers. Because I know you're definitely reading this. A 'Bourne Legacy' or 'Bourne Betrayal' is simply unnecessary. As Bourne rightly points out near the end of the film, 'This is where it started for me. This is where it ends.' Besides, who wants to hear yet another revamped version of Moby's 'Extreme Ways' over the credits in a couple of years time?",8,0,2,4 January 2008
Watchmen," I don't hear the Comedian telling any jokes. Even Rorschach told one.
","A mere twenty one years after the comic book was first published, the screen adaptation of the greatest graphic novel of all time (obviously I've read them all) is here and, with the exception of the entirely fatuous sex scene and questionable soundtrack choices, Watchman rules. The direction and cinematography is amazing; each scene has been expertly crafted and lavished with colours to mirror the panels in the comic book to such a degree that it would be pretty much impossible for any idiot fan boy to complain Alan Moore's original vision has been changed at all. There is only one major change to the story, the climax, which actually makes more sense. Plus, director Zach Synder hasn't slowed down two thirds of the film just to go 'Hey, you guys overtly suppressing their homosexual urges through sporadic outbursts of testosterone fuelled violence! Check out this action sequence! You can literally see everything that's happening, just in a slow and incredibly boring way!' as he did for 300. Instead, every scene flows perfectly and the slow-motion is only used when necessary, like for an unprovoked murder. Plus, the cast personify their graphic novel alter-egos meritoriously, particularly Jackie Earle Haley who takes the iconic character of Rorschach and somehow makes him illimitably cooler than he was in the novel.However, there is a noticeable problem. It lies in the story. Oh gasp. What resonance does a story involving the impending apex of the Cold War and mutually assured destruction for all have in today's society as it did when it was written amidst the end of détente, the Soviet war in Afghanistan, Olympic boycotts, billion dollar Strategic Defense Initiatives, nuclear stockpiling and so on? It doesn't have any. While there are indeed still problems such as nuclear stockpiling, further wars in Afghanistan and communist threats (referring to the metaphorical abortion that is North Korea), there is conversely nothing like the paranoia that gripped people with regard to these issues twenty years ago. Thus, Watchmen is unfortunately caught in a Catch-22 situation. If it had been made in the 1980s, it would've looked like Howard the Duck. Probably. Being made today, it can offer no substantial critique on society and is merely a series of pretty pictures set in a time that the majority of the audience know nothing about. It doesn't ruin the film, it is just frustrating to see that a film with a story as intelligent as this has had its message reduced to the same comic book level as The Dark Knight.Returning to the good stuff, it is refreshing to see that Zach Synder has not compromised his film in any way with regard to length and violence. At nearly three hours long the running time may alienate a lot of people but is incredibly rewarding for those who do choose to see it as Watchmen does not become boring even once. Not even the aforementioned sex scene is tedious as it is dealt with so badly (including the use of the pervasive 'Hallelujah' which never needs to be heard by anybody ever again) that it makes you glad Synder tried (but failed) to ruin the film with it. Concerning the violence, it isn't the typical comic-book standard. Incarnadine fountains of life force are routinely expelled across the screen, ivory shafts of splintered bone protrude from bodies like colonial flagpoles from an antediluvian age and people get blown up real good. This is accompanied on the whole by an underlying dark humour which goes some way to validating the gratuity. Pleasing.As a screen adaptation of an 'unfilmable' graphic novel, Watchmen is visually perfect. Every nuance on every panel has been studied and transferred to film. Everything fits except the story, with the Zeitgeist having little relevance today. But, in answer to the immemorial question 'Who watches the Watchmen?', I would say 'hopefully anyone who doesn't find a two metre long blue penis funny.' So nobody.",8,1,3,11 March 2009
Quantum of Solace," 'The name's Bo-' NO! We're still not doing that.
","Well this is disappointing. Despite Quantum of Solace's best interests, it has fallen into that 'Revamp the James Bond series by introducing a new actor and placing emphasis on realism but only for one film before reverting back to the previous ostentatious formula that the majority of Bond films employ even though nobody, except morons, wants this to happen.' Therefore, QoS is heavy on explosions, vehicle chases, one-dimensional megalomaniacs and things that would never happen, and light on plot, characters and most of the qualities that made Casino Royale such a success.Quantum of Solace picks up mere hours after Casino Royale left off, and director Marc Forster immediately foists a badly executed car chase onto the audience. It is like he is basically saying 'Seriously, it is going to be variations on this for 104 minutes. Transformers is my favourite film.' Forster seems to have graduated from the Bourne trilogy school of directing, which means audiences have to pay fastidious attention in order to discern any concrete happenings from the shaky cameras filming it. There's action going on there, sure, but we cannot see it.Following the car chase, serious Daniel Craig Bond flies to several destinations around the world (whose names are announced every time in a variety of different fonts and colours, which makes it look like the Powerpoint presentation of a twelve year old), shoots people without hesitation to show the audience how emotionally detached he is, saves a girl for no reason who by the law of film coincidence turns out to be the centre point of what little story there is and finally ends up in a trademark explosive house in the middle of nowhere filled with nothing but catwalks, propane tanks and bad guys. At many points it is difficult to know or care why Bond is going to Russia or London or Germany and Forster's lame attempts to misdirect the audience with yet another close up of Bond's face after he disarms and kills somebody within 3 seconds does nothing to appease this confusion. The political ambiguity and underhandedness between the USA and UK is perhaps the only aspect of the story that works, although the implications are never properly explored as that would be making some sort of statement and may offend at least four or five people.Daniel Craig plays Bond like he did in Casino Royale; it worked then because there was an underlying humour to many of his lines. This time around, the scriptwriters evidently decided time spent being funny and cool could be spent not talking and killing instead. He is still the best person in the world ever to wear a tuxedo though. Bond girl Olga Kurylenko makes about as much impact as she did in Hit-man, which is none at all, although she does get thrown head first through a glass table and shakes it off like it was a minor irritation. Fish-eyed Mathieu Amalric on the other hand, who plays evil genius Dominic Greene, is instantly memorable as the Bond villain whose mêlée fighting abilities include unintentionally hilarious screaming. He sounds like Björk.Minor characters are killed almost as quickly as they are introduced. One is Gemma Arterton, who plays Agent Fields, sent to bring Bond back to London but sleeps with him instead (obviously) and then, in a clumsy nod to Goldfinger, is killed after being drowned in oil. KthxFieldsbi! Another is Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini), whose death makes Bond seem callous and unlikeable. Finally, Jeffrey Wright, one of the most versatile and engaging actors around, is criminally underused as Felix Leiter. He is reduced to 'man with beard sitting around glowering at everybody' and when he finally gets to say something it is overshadowed by, surprise, Bond being chased.Quantum of Solace is by no means terrible but utterly fails to scale the heights of intelligence and enjoyment that Casino Royale reached in 2006 and, though Bond argues 'You don't have to worry about me', the seeds of doubt in the Bond franchise have once again been sown.",6,2,3,9 November 2008
I Am Legend," No way near as legendary as I'd hoped
","You have to hand it to the British people for discovering a cure for cancer which involves turning ninety-nine percent of the world's population into either corpses or bloodthirsty zombies who prey on the one percent that remain immune. That's earned us a cup of tea for sure. I Am Legend follows the life of Robert Neville (Will Smith), a Lieutenant Colonel/scientist stationed in New York city in the wake of this global disaster, attempting to develop a cure for over three years while living with his only companion, a dog named Samantha.Though many elements of the storyline stray dangerously close to ripping off 2002's 28 Days Later (in which the rage-infected zombies were also courtesy of British scientists; congratulations us), 'Legend's execution is so stylish it hardly seems to matter. We are treated to panoramic shots of a crumbling New York, its streets populated with a multitude of rusting cars, fauna sprouting uncontrollably from every crack in the ground. All bridges in and out of the city are destroyed, their skeletal frames still visible in some places. Wildlife from the Central Park Zoo runs freely through the city, unchecked by human hand. And living amongst all this is the Fresh Prince, wearing his cap sideways and shouting 'Aww, hell no!' at every opportunity. Not really. Once again, Will Smith delivers in spades. Throughout the film he accurately balances the dramatic with the humorous, with neither (until the final third) overshadowing the other. His conversations with his co-star, Abbey the Dog, are the source of the humour, though they also serve to highlight Neville's fragile hold on his sanity, as is shown further in the movie when he does temporarily lose his grip on reality. Smith portrays all this with veritable aplomb and makes you feel sincerely relieved that you were one of the 99% who were not immune, and thus able to sleep all day and dance all night. The zombies themselves are very similar to the perpetually vomiting cavemen from 2005's The Descent (perhaps director Francis Lawrence really likes British cinema), but for some reason much less terrifying. Perhaps because they've crossed the line from looking scary to looking ridiculous. Yes, that's it. However, the film isn't really about them, it's about one man and his dog. And assault rifle.Problems in 'Legend begin with the arrival of Anna, a refugee with a ten year old child in tow who heard the message Neville was broadcasting on the radio (Gettin' Jiggy With It I believe), urging survivors to find him. They are rather unnecessary to the plot and seem as if they were included only due to the film's hashed ending sequence. In fact, they are responsible for all the annoying points in the movie. Here's a list: 1) They ate Neville's bacon; he was saving it, 2) The child is responsible for allowing Shrek to take up half the running time of the film as it can be heard in the background, 3) Anna keeps referring to God and His plan for her which just seems out of place and awkward, 4) Anna does not know who Bob Marley is, 5) Neville has to tell her Bob Marley's Legend is the greatest album ever; he's wrong, and 6) Anna is directly responsible for leading the zombies to Neville's safe house, ushering in a watered down, cloying ending. Overall though, this does not affect the entertainment factor in any major sense.I Am Legend is also full of little extras which make you smile and generally enhance the viewing experience. Sure, the main one comes in the form of a Superman logo/Batman logo cinema poster, kind of like the alien skull in Predator 2, but there are others such as playing golf off a Blackbird jet, a two minute Emma Thompson cameo and the horrific waking deaths of billions of people. Splendid.To conclude, while some parts may seem a retread of the superior-in-every-way 28 Days Later, 'Legend is still definitely worth watching and Will Smith remains on top of his game, though with gold such as 'It's just... I was saving that bacon!', how could he not?",7,0,3,15 January 2008
The Dark Knight," 'Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We're tonight's entertainment.' You certainly are.
","That. Was. Brilliant. Do yourself a favor and go and see 'The Dark Knight' right away. If you've seen it already, go and see it again. It is by far the darkest, most multi-faceted and entertaining superhero movie ever made and the best movie of 2008 so far. All the ingredients are perfect: the cast, the plot (which cannot be summarized without spoiling the story, so I won't), the cinematography, the locations, the dialog, the tone, everything. That's right, fawning over TDK like a fan-boy is my new occupation.It is perhaps controversial to say this with regard to Heath Ledger's performance, but I actually think that TDK is Aaron Eckhart's film. He plays district attorney Harvey Dent, the 'white knight' of Gotham City, so-called because of his unwavering duty towards eradicating all crime in the city, and is the focus of Batman and the Joker's attention, both looking to use him as a figurehead for the infallible good or the temptation of evil. It can be compared to the 1960s when the United States and the Soviet Union used Vietnam as a battleground for their respective ideologies. Dent cuts a tragic figure; one minute he has it all, the next he has become that which he was dedicated to fighting against. By the climax, the audience may experience something of a malaise regarding his fate.Mentioning Heath Ledger is difficult without sounding like a sheep. Sure, he plays the role of his life and yes he'll probably earn at least an Oscar nomination for it, but I believe this is down to the direction of Christopher Nolan as much as it is Ledger himself. Nolan doesn't overexpose the Joker (unlike Tim Burton's 1989 original), preferring to keep him out of sight until main events occur. There are no scenes of the Joker's plans being prepared or his mental state being assessed or put into perspective. As Bertrand Russell would say, he 'just is', existing as an absolute to test the Batman.Completing the triumvirate of magnificent performances is Christian Bale's, whose Batman is subtly different from when we last saw him. His thirst for revenge seems to have cooled slightly although his level of brutality remains bordering on the malicious (like when he pushes a criminal out of a window just to break his legs.) Bale shows Batman's rising frustration as he turns to increasingly morally questionable methods in order to combat the organised chaos of the Joker, who presents himself as the id to Batman's overwrought superego. The interaction between the two is electrifying and builds throughout the film, so much so that when the finale eventually arrives, it is literally impossible to avert one's eyes from the screen.It is clear to see that Christopher Nolan assessed the shortcomings of 'Batman Begins' and actively sought to avoid them this time around. Gone is the utterly misplaced comic relief element in Lieutenant Gordon (played by the ever rewarding Gary Oldman) and the suspension of disbelief elements like the violence-inducing hallucinogen and millennia-old secret ninja society. TDK remains much more grounded in reality. The criminals use firearms to obtain what they want in a city that looks like New York. Deaths are shown unflinchingly and frequently. With the exception of the Joker, every character is shown to be vulnerable. There is no expectation that 'Batman will save us' here. It sets a much darker tone than the first film and is ultimately what elevates it from other standard comic book fare.Overall 'The Dark Knight' not only lives up to expectations, but far surpasses them. Although over two and a half hours long, it leaves you feeling satiated and content but with a willingness to experience it over and over again. This is one franchise that needs more sequels and soon. As Bruce Wayne aptly says, 'Batman has no limits.'",9,1,3,20 July 2008
There Will Be Blood," There Will Be Boredom
","After reading all the hype surrounding There Will Be Blood (Daniel-Day Lewis's Academy Award nominated performance, Paul Thomas Anderson's directing, the cinematography etc) I expected the pièce de résistance of 2007 cinema. However, it was actually more disappointing than American Gangster. Sure I may (and most probably have) missed the point of TWBB, but even if I did get it, I doubt I would have been any more entertained. It really was boring. The story, the characters, the setting, everything. Well, everything except Daniel Day-Lewis. His performance as conflicted small-time oil baron Daniel Plainview is exceptional. So is his mantastic moustache. If the whole film was stripped down to him offering profound monologues on various turn-of-the-century American Midwest sets, it would be acceptable. He really was the only factor maintaining my interest in the film, although he should still lose the Academy Award to Viggo Mortensen. However, if there was an award for hobbling duck walks, Day-Lewis would win by a mile.One particularly irritating aspect of TWBB is the character Eli Sunday, played by Paul Dano. Yes, I realise he's supposed to be irritating; that does not make his screeching voice or perpetual presence any easier to accommodate. Though evidently supposed to be a focal point of TWBB, his very existence drags the already unpromising premise (Oil! Wow!) into insipid mess territory. I cheered (well I didn't, but I could have) every time something bad happened to him, which was not often enough. Another annoying character is Plainview's 'son', H.W, who we're supposed to feel sorry for, for some reason. Considering his total absence of character development and the way he magically ages about ten years near the end of the film, the only feeling he evokes is puzzlement and indifference. And they're pretty much the only people I can recall. Oh, except for Plainview's long lost 'brother', the human equivalent of a plank of wood with a moustache drawn on by a Biro which has been chewed on incessantly by a moron. Other than Daniel Day-Lewis, the only positive aspect that can be taken from TWBB is the score composed by Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead. Paranoid and edgy, it fits the bleak atmosphere of the film perfectly. Actually, I would rather just listen to the score on its own. Although then it would remind me that I watched this in the first place. Great, everything is ruined.So, don't bother watching this turgid shambles unless for some reason you derive some kind of sadomasochistic pleasure from boring yourself stupid. Instead, just download the soundtrack instead and listen to it free from lingering, unwanted vestiges of There Will Be Blood invading your thoughts. To amend a quote by Plainview, 'That wasN'T one goddamn helluva show.'",3,10,17,15 February 2008
American Gangster," Spoilers for what? Nothing interesting happens.
","The latest Ridley Scott/Russell Crowe collaboration reminds me a lot of Serpico (1973.) You've got the star talent (i.e. Crowe in place of Pacino), the premise of an honest policeman working nearly alone to expose corruption in the police force and the backdrop of 1970s New York to do it in. Also, like Serpico, it fails to deliver in most respects. Much of the film concerns Denzel Washington as the eponymous American Gangster Frank Lucas, a violent criminal from Harlem with a monopoly on the heroin trade in New York. Russell Crowe is Richie Roberts, the narcotics officer tasked with bringing him down. Sounds exciting doesn't it? Well it isn't. At 157 minutes long, 'Gangster was always going to have a job keeping the audience's attention for the entire time. However, it didn't even keep my attention for half the time. The various threads at the start of the film take over an hour to actually intertwine with each other, by which time I didn't care anymore. Even then, there's no payoff until around near the end with a pseudo-Godfather montage of Richie destroying Lucas' entire operation while Lucas attends church with his mother. I for one expected Lucas to go down in a blaze of frenzied violence inside the church (indeed a Denzel-Training Day death was all I was waiting for,) thus salvaging some of the previously wasted 2 hours but no, it's not that kind of film. Instead, Frank Lucas provides evidence against all the corrupt narcotics policemen in New York and gets to serve a fifth of his prison time for it. So basically the story is 'Policeman arrests baddie who rats on other baddies and goes to prison but not for long.' How disappointing.As for the characters, Denzel Washington fluctuates from being a cool, controlled, intelligent and observant customer to a Tony Montana-esquire psychopath who repeatedly attacks his brothers and cousins if things go wrong. Indeed, the only cool instance worthy of remembrance by Lucas is where he shoots a rival without hesitation in a street in broad daylight. If only the rest of the film had been full of these little gems. Instead we are treated to the estrangement and divorce proceedings of Richie Roberts from his wife (yawn) and constant reminders that as an honest cop he has to do everything himself, with no help from the suits upstairs. Josh Brolin puts in a trite performance as one of the cops on the take, adding nothing except a homosexual moustache to the proceedings. For once Cuba Gooding Jr is competent in his role, which is the best one could hope for. Finally, the last individual who sticks in the mind long enough to form an opinion of is Armand Assante, who is actually rather good in his hunting jacket and Vito Corleone mannerisms. Oh, and special mention has to go to the Vietnamese heroin plantation owner who looks like a drag queen in a suit.Overall I would not waste my time with this again even if there are a couple of cool moments and the clothes look splendid. Considering the extensive hype and promise surrounding the film, the quote by Frank Lucas 'The loudest man in the room is also the weakest man in the room' sums up American Gangster nicely.",5,20,34,23 November 2007
Hancock," Will Smith suddenly hates the public and gives us Hancock.
","It turns out that the new Will Smith Summer extravaganza 'Hancock' is actually two films spliced together with all the finesse and care of Dr Joseph Mengele. Half of the 92 minute runtime is a promisingly original concept concerning an 'only one of his kind' superhero alienated from the rest of society and existing only as a recluse who occasionally shows up in Los Angeles to save its hapless inhabitants. The problem lies in the fact that Hancock frequently conducts his superhero-ing whilst under the influence of a bottle of Jim Beam or two and thus often causes more havoc than he prevents. One sterling example the movie presents early on is when, upon having his sunglasses destroyed by a car full of criminals, Hancock effortlessly lifts the car up and skewers it like an olive on the spire of a nearby skyscraper. Events like this lead to public outcry and Hancock's semi-voluntary incarceration after striking a deal with public relations man Jason Bateman, who vows to help him change his ways after the Übermensch saves his life. Seemingly, the remainder of the film would therefore consist of Hancock's gradual path to redemption, winning back the admiration of the public and possibly experiencing a climactic 'Boss Battle' where Hancock learns some kind of important moral. Although not a particularly groundbreaking road to take and particularly wasteful of the idea of what it could mean to 'play God,' 'Hancock' would remain an interesting little package. Instead, at around the one hour mark, director Peter Berg inflicts a whiplash-inducing U-turn on the audience and embarks on a totally different story arc. Does this mean that it is less predictable? No. Does it mean that Berg destroys the film in much the same way that Robert Rodriguez did with 'From Dusk Till Dawn?' Yes.It is difficult to analyse anything about 'Hancock' without relating it to the second half of the movie, like Will Smith's performance for example. It isn't possible to abhor Will Smith. He exists in the collective unconscious of the world's population as one of the coolest and most likable actors around. The second half of 'Hancock' tries its hardest to change this preconception. Willard (yeah, Tonight With Jonathan Ross IS informative) must have known that the movie couldn't work when he read the script for it, so why did he agree to do it? Does he hate us? He seems to be sleepwalking through much of the film, the antithesis of his role in 'I Am Legend' earlier this year. Also, something I've noticed more and more in the past couple of year is the use of the 'Will Smith Patented Sad Puppy Eyeballs Look' for whenever Will has to convey a heartfelt emotion. He does it the most in 'The Pursuit of Happiness' but 'Hancock' receives its fair share too. And why is he pouting so much? Constipation, probably.Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron are pretty much the only other characters in 'Hancock,' unless you want to acknowledge the existence of Eddie Marsan as the thoroughly mismatched antagonist, which I don't. He is about as good at acting as Shane Ryder is at singing. Even if 'Hancock' wasn't a mess already, he would totally ruin it. Luckily for him it sucks, which means he merely makes any scene he is in unwatchable. Bateman on the other hand mellifluously occupies space and does nothing more, although you can't help feeling sorry for him around two-thirds of the way through. Considering Charlize Theron's character is responsible for the abrupt twist (well not really, the writers are), it is difficult not to hate her. So don't even try. Just loathe every moment she spends talking, eating, moving or just breathing. It will make you feel better.Just because 'Hancock' features the irrefutable king of the blockbuster does not mean that it is good. At one point our hero asks 'Do I look like I care what people think?' Clearly, nobody involved in the making of this fiasco does at all.",3,12,22,5 July 2008
Iron Man," Yeah, Iron Man can fly.
","Unspectacular. Stygian. Tedious. Youth Hostel. These are just some of the terms you will never hear in conjunction with 'Iron Man,' the latest Marvel superhero brought to life with hundreds of millions of dollars for the big screen. Happily, it belongs far more to the 'X-Men' and 'Batman Begins' camp more than it does to the poorhouse inhabited by 'Ghostrider,' 'Daredevil,' and 'The Fantastic Four.' However, 'Iron Man' appears to be holding back slightly throughout (clearly for the sequel), which prevents it from properly cementing its status as one of the frontrunners of the superhero genre.Iron Man works due to Robert Downey Jr. It is as simple as that. With any other actor in the role (except perhaps Christian Bale; obviously not an option), the character of Tony Stark would have been an annoying, conceited and unfunny idiot with a beard. Therefore, the film could not work. Downey Jr, on the other hand, becomes Tony Stark incarnate. He makes him likable and believable, especially during his transformation from carefree playboy to killing machine. Unlike other superhero movies, where upon gaining their life changing powers the protagonist becomes a total do-gooder with absolute values towards right and wrong, Tony Stark remains grounded in his own world, maintaining his own flawed set of beliefs and essentially continuing to live as the same person. Due to his status as a playboy there is no blatantly proposed love interest which is a relief because nobody goes to see a superhero film to watch the protagonist try to find true love (think about that, Batman.) Sure, eventually Tony will bed his assistant, the outlandishly named Pepper Potts (a shrewd Gwyneth Paltrow), but not in this instalment so nobody has to worry. Also, as much of Terence Howard's role as Colonel Jim Rhodes (the future most imaginatively titled superhero ever, War Machine) was cut, there is little focus on characters who aren't Tony. Downey Jr has all the time he needs to mould his protagonist into a real human being. Conveniently it also leaves much more time for seamless CGI ass kicking which, with the exception of the final battle, leaves you wishing Tony Stark spent more time in the suit than he does designing it. One case in point is when the 'Man is flying at the speed of sound when he is shot from the air by a tank. After falling hundreds of feet to the ground he stands up, sidesteps a second tank shell and then destroys it with a flick of his wrist. It is so cool. Explosions and death for all.'Iron Man' does not deserve congratulations all round though. Director Jon Favreau decided at some point that, instead of a final battle between good and evil which would uphold the intelligent atmosphere created by the rest of the film, he would direct the sequel to 'Transformers' instead and shoehorn it in. Because apparently that is what everybody wanted. Iron Man battles the ingeniously named and similarly attired Iron Monger (played camped-up villain style by Jeff Bridges), who take turns to punch each other through buildings. When they tire of this (not soon enough), they fly into the air and punch each other some more. Finally, they fall to the ground, punch each other in the helmets a little and then the entire audience has a seizure and dies. It is such a letdown. Sure, Jeff Bridges' character was a little cartoonish in relation to the darker tone pervading the film anyway, but that doesn't mean that the final twenty minutes of 'Iron Man' should be the equivalent of watching somebody play a video game.Aside from this, 'Iron Man' is still easily able to support its reputation as the first of this Summer's 'must-see' blockbusters and, with Robert Downey Jr wholly committed to the character and the inevitable sequels, it could supersede 'Spiderman' as Marvel's flagship franchise. The creases just have to be ironed out. As Jim Rhodes says, 'Next time, baby!'",7,1,3,5 May 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," Yippie Kay Yay Mother- No! No swearing for you McClane.
","McClane is back, but not better than ever. After a twelve year hiatus, Bruce Willis returns with less hair, less violence and less believability. The film begins promisingly, with a grizzled McClane observed to be tailing his daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) on a date, receiving a routine call to pick up a suspect (Justin Long) in an FBI case, bad guys subsequently popping out of the woodwork all over the place, leading to a high body count and millions of dollars worth of damage. Willis slips back into his signature role with ease, bringing to McClane a sense of bitterness and resentment not present in the previous three films, probably induced by his divorce, estrangement from his children and general world-weariness. This portrayal continues throughout the film and brings a new edge to his character and therefore to the story.The antagonists are introduced mainly through a plethora of scenes involving them typing on keyboards, wearing headsets and looking at computer screens. Riveting. There is no underlying menace present in a single one of these 'cyber-terrorists,' as there was with Alan Rickman and his band of deutsche Soldaten in the original. There is never a sense that McClane is actually in danger once the action starts, the exception to this being Maggie Q's character in the gas refinery who unfortunately meets a premature end (she was much more interesting than that Parkour guy.) Even the main villain, Timothy Olyphant, having mastered the cold, steely-eyed stare necessary for world domination, deliberates so much over killing McClane's daughter (even though McClane mocks Olyphant for 'ramming an SUV' up his girlfriend/wife's ass, killing her horribly) that it is difficult to feel as though McClane is under threat. Another antagonist, in the form of a fighter jet, leads to the film's most improbable set piece, in which McClane is forced to jump from the lorry which he is driving onto the wing of the plane to escape a soon-to-be-rubble multi story car park. He then literally surfs on the jet's wing until it nears the ground, at which point he neatly jump off, rolls and walks away unscathed as the plane explodes. It's more XXX than Die Hard, which is clearly not a good thing.However the other action sequences are excellent, encompassing elements from all the previous three films. The apartment shootout is reminiscent of the claustrophobic atmosphere prevalent throughout the first, the demolition of the gas refinery reminds one of the wide scale destruction in the second and the two instances in which McClane disposes of a helicopter is evocative of the third. Also, the constant reuse of dialogue such as 'Buckle up' and 'Just hang on!' serve as reminders in themselves. This is not a bad thing, as it makes Die Hard 4.0 feel as though it belongs with the others.Regarding the supporting cast, Justin Long seems to thoroughly enjoy his role, receiving some of the best dialogue in the film, though he can get a little annoying during the action scenes. Plus, we don't need to see him working furiously at his computer while McClane is kicking ass. Nobody prefers a download screen to badassery. Mary Elizabeth Winstead has a small role but she does the best she can under this limitation. I would say she's more there to take over the babe role after Maggie Q meets her end, but she also manages to help out her father in the end by shooting a baddie in the foot. Kevin Smith plays a great role as a computer hacker living in his mother's basement, who at one point enquires to Long, 'Why did you bring a cop to my command centre?' and only after being screamed at by McClane through a CB radio, grudgingly assists him to prevent his daughter from being killed. He's like Argyle in the original, totally pointless but excellent.Overall there are enough real stunts, explosions and deaths in Die Hard 4.0 to warrant it a place amongst the series and, though at times it can seem like an elongated episode of 24, delivers enough action and one-liners, making it worth the wait for any Die Hard fan. Yippie Kay Yay, Motherfu- BAM!",7,1,3,22 July 2007
Valkyrie," I think 'contains spoiler' is a little paradoxical in this case.
","Well, how excellent and disconsolate was that? First of all, Valkyrie (or, 'The film in which the most evil man in history triumphs over the protagonists, effectively ensuring the further deaths of millions of people worldwide, hooray') heralds the return of the indubitably talented Tom Cruise in his first role worth watching since 2004's Collateral. Secondly, Valkyrie is directed by Bryan Singer, who after purposely destroying most of Superman Returns remembers that he is actually a brilliant director, not a terrible one, and drops the comic books in favour of exploring the original man influenced by the idea of Nietzsche's Übermensch, Adolf Hitler. Thirdly, there is no happy Hollywood ending. Hitler is not killed, the war does not end, and none of the conspirators get away with it. They are all unceremoniously executed. How refreshing.The story is everything in Valkyrie. The plot concerns Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Cruise) and a resistance of like-minded civilian and military persons who conspire to assassinate Hitler and place a new government in power before any of his inner circle can seize control. Obviously this fails. You might think that knowing what happens at the end would spoil it, but actually quite the opposite is the case. Despite knowing the outcome, you still find yourself hoping that their plan will succeed and for maybe five minutes it seems to the audience, and to Stauffenberg, that the impossible has been achieved; the coup d'etat has been successful, Berlin is under resistance leadership, and contingents of SS soldiers are being arrested all over Europe. Sadly, the dream crumbles, everybody is put to death, and the audience eat their popcorn somewhat slower than they did a moment ago (although, who still has popcorn at the end of a film? The human/idiot behind me.) What is truly interesting about Valkyrie are the butterfly-effect instances which interfere with Stauffenberg's plot. For instance, the sunny weather means that the room for Hitler's military conference is moved to a place not as susceptible to a bomb blast. A couple of degrees lower in temperature and he would almost certainly have been killed. Similarly, the hesitant decision by the officer in charge of the station which relayed military orders across Germany to side against Stauffenberg and therefore cut off any communication from his headquarters destroys any chance the resistance have of maintaining control. This may or may not be the worst decision of all time (except for that entirely unrelated one in 1933.) Thankfully, the usually espiègle Cruise plays Stauffenberg as entirely serious, a tortured man who can see how Hitler's actions will cloud the world's judgement of 'unser heiliges Deutschland' for generations to come. Cruise particularly shines following Stauffenberg's realisation that his plot has failed, as you can see the hope literally draining from his face to be replaced by abject resignation. Bill Nighy as General Olbricht is likewise fantastic, not only because he looks like a zombie, but because he highlights Olbricht's questionable actions during the coup and does not try to paint his character in a sympathetic light, despite his position as a key member of the resistance.Only a couple of trivial factors detract from Valkyrie. Firstly, why does Albert Speer only receive a one second cameo? 'Because he has nothing to do with the film.' Fine, but the actor playing Speer looked more like him than the actor portraying Göring, and Göring had numerous close-ups in the Berghof scene. Secondly, which is more of a continuation of the first point, why didn't the casting crew cast the sergeant in the relay room, who played Göring in Hitler: the Rise of Evil, as Göring? 'Because you're literally the only person in the world who cares, that's why.' Fine.Overall, everybody should see Valkyrie because it is an important film that does not shy away from telling the truth about a number of Germans who actively opposed Hitler's totalitarian regime. As some colonel says, 'Every second we stand here is a second lost!' So...go and see it quickly.",8,0,0,30 January 2009
