Kill Bill: Vol. 2," On par with Volume 1?
","Kill Bill Vol. 2 is the more Tarantino-esc of the Kill Bill movies, with less emphasis on action (although Vol. 2 has my favourite action scene from the 2 movies, that being the trailer fight) and this time I greater focus on his trademark dialogue and character building. While the Bride stole the show in Vol. 1, this time it's Bill who's the standout, with the actor having the perfect balance of charm and creepy that makes you buy his history with the Bride.This movie also has one of my favourite Tarantino moments, which makes one inch punching look like the most badass move ever invented by man! Overall, Vol. 2 acts as a very satisfying conclusion to what Vol. 1 set up, and while it may be slower, it's just as memorable, and just as rewatchable.",8,1,2,4 August 2018
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino's Top Three
","If you love Quentin Tarantino's style, Inglorious Basterds is going to be an absolute treat for you. It's widely considered by many, even Tarantino himself, to be his 'masterpiece' or his best since Pulp Fiction, and it is absolutely, undoubtedly worthy of such praise.The dialogue here is arguably sharper than it has ever been - even Pulp Fiction has a couple minutes worth of conversation within it that aren't particularly entertaining, as only one scene in this film failed to completely hold my interest, and that is quite possibly the shortest scene in here! Every other moment of IB manages to completely hook you and draw you into the world, whether it's the vibrant Brad Pitt making you laugh, or the scene stealer Christoff Waltz making you anxious, with Tarantino crafting some of his most memorable characters and using dialogue in this film to fuel the suspense, making conversations that go on for 20 or 30 minutes worth of screen time a never-ending spiral of anxiety that reaches a satisfying peak each time.The performances and writing are even more worthy of applause considering a great deal of the movie is spoken in another language, an element of war that other directors choose to ignore, but which Tarantino uses as a tool for suspenseful storytelling and sequences, fixing an issue which we didn't really know we had as an audience. As Tarantino so eloquently put it, other films 'have this opportunity for a great scene, but you're pissing it away by having German be English'.It also offers a great deal of memorable Tarantino moments, including a tense 20 minute opening, a baseball bat, quite possibly the longest bar scene known to man, and an ending that doesn't limit itself with what really happened throughout history.As a result, while Pulp Fiction may be a more iconic and witty flick, IB is the Tarantino film I think about most, from the characters, to the conversations, to the ending, to the direction, if you weren't already obsessed with Tarantino, Inglorious Basterds has a good shot at changing that.",9,2,4,2 August 2019
Shaun of the Dead," An underrated masterpiece
","The fact that Shaun of the Dead has gone largely unnoticed by the masses is the biggest sin in the world of cinema to this day. Shaun of the Dead is renowned director Edgar Wright's best film to date - his passion of storytelling, intricate detailing, exciting direction, character building, world building, everything is at its most apparent here.I think I've seen Shaun of the Dead more than any other movie and I still find things in it that I failed to see on the other viewings every time. Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg's screenplay is nothing short of masterful and quite simply one of the best screenplays of all time. Nearly every line of dialogue, every shot, every action, acts as foreshadowing, or as part of a before/after structure that shows character growth and story progression. Every second of film here is put to good use, and there isn't a hair or screen-time you could remove - everything is made integral in the most tight-nit story I've seen to this day. Edgar Wright's direction makes everything fun and entertaining, from his visual comedy, to adding flare to the most mundane tasks such as making toast and tea.Not to mention, every character is superbly written to be consistent and show growth, or provide the tools for growth in the other characters. Shaun has to be in my top 50 protagonists of all time for being incredibly relateable, likeable, and proactive even while being an Everyman. The performances help so much too, with Nick frost being the standout as he makes a character that could easily be annoying if not played right a charming and hilarious addition to the cast. These aren't your usual zombie movie stereotypes, there are characters the film makes you care and root for.Speaking of the zombie genre, I believe this film is the best example of how to do a spoof of a genre, as while conventions are somewhat mocked and poked fun at, the story is still intense, the characters are human beings and not over the top caricatures, and most of all the threat is still very real - I first saw this film when I was 7 and some of the zombie moments haunted me for a couple years before I was brave enough to watch it again.Charming, indescribably clever, and just simply a masterpiece - Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg deserve ALL the oscars for this triumph of film.",10,1,2,29 July 2019
Deadpool 2," This movie looks like a meta joke married a vulgar script
","The first thing to notice about Deadpool 2 is how much it improves on the first, from the comedy, to the story (which is 10x better than before), to the action, to the direction, to the characters. Deadpool 2 feels more like a movie than the first, and not a 20 minute storyline painfully stretched out to be feature length. And while the first 30 minutes do become boring, overall this is a much better time than before, it even has some decent emotional moments (which could be completely undercut if the end credits scene is canon). The story is still nothing special, and still falls into the trap of being exactly like the cliché comic book movies it ridicules, and is no where near as meta as it thinks it is, or needs to be, in order to be something really different, especially when all marvel movies mock themselves anyway. The Deadpool movies simply need to go further as at the moment the meta moments are by far the most forced and unfunny moments in them - why hold back? Why make a joke about there being a big CGI fight, but then have the CGI fight play out like a normal movie? Truly go for it, do something like render the CGI so bad and maybe you could get something more than a cheap laugh.Speaking of laughs, this is THE definition of 50/50 comedy, and truly is one of the best examples of the writers throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks.Ryan Reynolds is clearly in love with this character and is a big reason these movies work, and with this being a large step up from the boring, formulaic first instalment, hopefully part 3 will top them both.",7,1,3,5 August 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Who cares if it's different, this is awesome!
","The main aspect that makes this film so good is the tone - Marvel finally decided to make Thor fun to watch and the comedy, the music, the locations, and the characters are some of the best in the MCU. This is all apparent when the characters are on the vibrant and bursting with energy planet of Saccar. This is truly the highlight of the movie, and what saves it, with Jeff Goldblum giving just...just such a Goldblum performance I miss him every time he's not onscreen.Basically everything that doesn't take place on Saccar is what brings the movie down. The first 20 minutes or so feels disjointed and uninteresting, and anything with the bland and cliché villain on Asgard is so tiresome.As a result this is a very mid-tier Marvel movie, it has very high highs but still falls victim to the forgettability and boringness of the Thor franchise (although this is undoubtedly the best of the three). The comedy is very clearly improvised and 90% of the time it works, but some of it can feel awkward, especially between Hemsworth and Ruffalo (although the Thor/Hulk team up is one of the things that makes this movie.Great comedy, great atmosphere, but weak story. As said before, just a mid-tier marvel movie.",7,1,2,5 August 2018
The Hateful Eight," A wasted opportunity?
","Before seeing the hateful eight, if you were to offer me a Tarantino movie, set in western times about a group of characters trapped inside a cabin and having to bounce off each other with signature Tarantino dialogue and writing, I would have bitten your hand off! Unfortunately, the Hateful Eight doesn't get good until the second half of the movie, where Samuel L Jackson delivers an iconic, hilarious monologue that rivals the likes of Jules' 'vengeance' speech in pulp fiction. After this point, the Tarantino-isms truly kick into gear, and the suspense, the wit, the gore, and the characters truly shining and being some of Tarantino's best work, with Warren and Mannix being the stand-outs. However, what makes this film so frustrating is the incredibly tiresome, boring, and irrelevant first half, which definitely should have been cut down, not only to make the film better over all, but to increase the rewatch value. Out of all the Tarantino movies I've seen so far, I feel I am least likely to revisit this one, with its nearly 3 hour run time and monotonous first half, which feels like another writer trying to imitate Tarantino's style, rather than an actual Tarantino movie. If you were to take one thing from this review, I would say completely skip the first hour and 20 minutes or so to where Samuel L Jackson delivers a speech about his 'big black pecker' and watch the chaos from there! But because of that first half, I feel the Hateful Eight is one of Tarantino's weaker projects, or at the very least the most frustrating.",6,1,1,4 August 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Desperate, rushed, pathetic
","The Rise of Skywalker is a rushed, heartless, and desperate attempt to conclude the Skywalker saga in a fashion that will annoy the least fans possible. Say what you want about the Last Jedi, but still least it was a cohesive storyline with fleshed out characters who had clear personalities, and a sense of escalation which resulted in an unforgettable finale, love it or hate it. Episode 9's story is just watching a bloated load of dispensable characters run around the galaxy doing busy work - no sense of tension, no escalation, and a critical lack of character drama.Pretty much every character in episode 9 could be plucked out of the story and their lack of involvement wouldn't affect the plot at all - whether that's the conflicted and cared Fin, who should have died in order to complete his arc in the Last Jedi as the writers clearly have no idea what to do with him now, or the charismatic, heroic Po, who's character sees a complete 180 this time round - gone are the days of the Force Awakens where Po was the most likeable character to grace the franchise since the originals, and in his place is a moody, argumentative control freak. As a result, seeing the main trio finally together onscreen is massively underwhelming - there's no sense of friendship or bond, just three people obligated to work with one another, with no time to grow as the plot is moving at such a breakneck pace that it has to time to flesh out any of its cast other than Rey and Kylo, who continue to be the trilogy's most intriguing relationship, with Adam Driver definitely being the most charismatic actor throughout the trilogy.The pace is easily the films biggest flaw - too quickly characters are introduced, brought back, killed off (especially Leia, whos death scene is hugely rushed and out of nowhere), so none of it has any time to sit, make an impact, or feel important - no one was mourning when C3PO lost his memory, because the characters didn't care, and the storyline was completed too quickly to be impactful.Not to mention the desperate attempts to fix the story changes that Last Jedi made. The decisions made by Johnson were undoubtedly controversial, but JJ Abrams appears doubly as cynical in his intentions as he claws at any opportunity to bring the trilogy back in line with the expectations of the fans, completely ignoring the revelations of episode 8 by rewriting Rey's past in a predictable and pandering twist which does nothing but take away any respect left for this trilogy - if the people behind the scenes can't be confident in the stories they are putting out, how can the fans be?",1,31,52,24 December 2019
Bird Box," Wasted concept
","The idea behind the antagonistic force and the political allegory that Bird Box offers is compelling, but neither are expanded upon even remotely enough to provide a satisfying 2 hour experience.The best word to explain bird box is 'confused', with concepts and character arcs that are set up with no interesting exploration or payoff. The rules of the monstorous force are not established or explained, leading to confusing moments regarding how it affects humans differently and what it is actually capable of. The main character is established in an exposition-heavy 10 minute dialogue fest (which I somewhat appreciate for getting to the point, with some decent chemistry with the wasted sister character), but her inner conflicts never come into play to make her interesting until the very end of the 2 hour run time. This character moment is better than nothing, but it undoubtedly required more set up to be powerful in any way. Even the plot device the film is named after - the fact that birds can sense danger, doesn't come into play at all throughout the film, providing only a catchy title.The characters of the film are mostly unwatchable, with rushed introductions and motivations, no subtlety, and even less originality. Sandra bullock gives the best performance she possibly can with what little character she's given, but none of the other actors stood out to me, all ranging from good to cheesily bad, with John Malkovich giving an awful performance this time round.Overall, Bird Box is incredibly unsatisfyingly considering it's concept and early reception, which could have worked after a couple more rewrites that fixed issues with the characters, rules, and pacing.",3,3,5,3 January 2019
Baby Driver," It's good, but not Edgar Wright good
","Baby Driver turns out to be Edgar Wright's blandest, most forgettable film yet, as much of his directing flare is pushed aside with the main gimmick of the film placed primarily on the notion that the action is edited in time with the music. This is a fun gimmick for sure, but is it enough to keep me invested? Am I going to remember it 10 years from now? Definitely not.Edgar's normal talent of visual storytelling and progression is nearly gone from this film, as is the memorable, witty, relatable main character, as Baby, apart from having tenitits, and being a remixer, is by far his blandest protagonist yet. In fact, the rest of the characters are bland too, with a cliche group of crooks, with Jamie Foxx's character being the most over the top, predictable, and least interesting of the bunch, and Kevin Spacey being another typical stern mob boss character, who takes a complete 180 in the climax for the sake of the narrative, which there really isn't anything to - the story feels empty. Nothing of note happens here, and that'd be okay if the characters were memorable, but they just aren't. Not to mention the completely undeveloped love story embedded in here.While I could contently watch it again due to the well edited action, and John Ham's performance, Baby Driver is definitely Edgar Wright's least interesting project yet, and really doesn't have a lot to offer in terms of character or plot.",6,0,1,31 July 2019
Avengers: Endgame," 10x better than infinity war
","End Game holds the same epic scale as Infinity War but with everything the first part lacked. This time around, the Russo's provide a more personal, character driven-tale filled with important character moments that I felt Infinity War severely lacked. As a result, despite the stakes being lower in this instalment, I was 10x more invested in the story and action and I truly worried for our heroes this time round.Our two main hero's, Cap and Tony, are definitely at their best here, despite their tensions from Civil war being brushed aside a little too quickly. The two actors are masters of these roles right now and all of their work pays off, with both characters seeing incredibly satisfying ends by the film's climax. Not to mention, other returning hero's also have satisfying, but admittedly controversial arcs, like Banner and Thor (who isn't as interesting as he was in Infinity war, but is still much better than the pre-Ragnarok rendition of the character).Because of the more personal story, the action feels less noisy and instead more tense and satisfying, with the final battle being by far the best that the series has offered.While Thanos takes a back seat in this film, he still remains menacing in his moments onscreen and an incredible motivator for our heroes that we've come to love over the years.Overall, End Game improves every weak aspect of Infinity War, and acts as a perfect conclusion to the Infinity saga.",9,65,106,21 July 2019
Toy Story 4," The worst Toy Story...by far
","As someone who's grown up with the toy story franchise, Toy Story 4 is an unnecessary entry that ruins the perfect, satisfying, and emotional conclusion of 3, and instead leaving the franchise with an unneeded ending that doesn't feel earned, emotional, or gratifying in the slightest.Toy Story 4 pushes away a majority of the characters we have grown up with, even Buzz who is given an extremely dumbed down role in the film, in favour of a slew of new characters that aren't given nearly enough time to be new franchise favourites, even if they are entertaining in their short moments onscreen (besides the snooze-inducing villain).While Woody's journey in this film does have interesting moments, Toy Story 4 feels far more linear and uninspired than any of the other movies, ranging from boring, to frustrating when the film ends on a moment that is meant to be tearjerking and heartbreaking, and is instead incredibly frustrating as it feels like a waste of everything in the series so far, rapidly throwing away the character relationships we've grown up to love and cherish as audiences.In conclusion, the beautiful animation is not enough to accommodate for the uninteresting story and completely baffling ending.",4,7,12,20 July 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Spectacular and forgettable
","It's impossible not to merit Infinity War, the fact that a movie could have this many characters and stay coherant is admirable, and the effects and actors are phenominal throughout - I truly believed I was seeing these heroes fight in these otherworldy locations. The best parts of the movie are when the characters are just talking to each other - the wit and the charm still shines through in a movie this jam packed. On the other hand, the action is forgettable and boring, and basically pointless. There's no tension - you as an audience member know that the avengers aren't going to defeat thanos in a fight, so why is so much of the run time devoted to character after character punch him? The final battle is the typical avengers noise fest where you know none of the characters are in danger and nothing of note is going to happen. As a result, Infinity War fails to get me invested or interested, there's no emotional core to the movie so everything is just noise. The ending is predictable, what will happen in the hopefully better and more focused next movie is predictable, objectively you have to give the movie credit for managing to stay coherant but in the end most of it fell flat to me.Packed with boring action, writing shortcuts, inconsistencies, emotional moments that fall flat because the film is so desperate to move onto the next plot point, and pushing some of the best characters to the side, I won't be revisiting this one any time soon.",6,1,4,5 August 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Another frustrating Tarantino entry
","Following the frustrating entry to Tarantino's career that was Hateful Eight, the living legend is back with yet another divisive and controversial flick to add to his discography, while carrying over many of the flaws seen with his aforementioned previous film.An obvious flaw is the length. Even to the most devoted Tarantino fans, it's undeniable that he seems to be getting carried away with his writing following his label as one of the greatest directors of our generation. With now 9 films under his belt, Tarantino seems to have no concept of when to pull back on the running times of his films anymore - with his last 3 films (including this one) being his longest films to date. Whereas with Django unchained it's length was justified, with his previous two entries, the plots are simply far too simplistic to justify nearly 3 hour run times.Once Upon A Time in Hollywood feels like a spiritual successor to Pulp Fiction, where it's a seemingly plotless film driven by a talented cast, except this time without Tarantino bothering to write anything - a painful amount of this movie feels like it was dedicated to just watching our characters walk or drive around with very little happening - The most frustrating example of which is Margot Robbie's character, who only exists to walk around, speak for once scene, then provide the fake-out ending similar to the one seen in Inglorious Basterds. Only in Inglorious Basterds, the ending was earned after the whole film was building to it, whereas here, the film generally meanders for 2 hours and 20 minutes, with Tarantino abandoning his use of encapsulating dialogue (which made Hateful Eight bareable), only for a final 20 minutes that rushes to an out of nowhere conclusion.Whats the most annoying is that when the regular Tarantino-isms are at play, the film can be tense, emotional, and satisfying, but far too much of the film is spent meandering for these moments to feel gratifying, and now these tropes are starting to come off as a punchline, with the numerous shots of feet, and Tarantino literally cutting through a conversation with Dicaprio and Olyphant, as if to show awareness of how his dialogue scenes can drag.The legendary director is still in there, it just requires a stripped back runtime and more time spent with the films characters to feel truly gratifying again.",4,3,8,14 June 2020
Reservoir Dogs," Pulp Fiction Before Pulp Fiction?
","As someone who considers Pulp Fiction to be one of the best movies ever made, I was looking forward to seeing a movie made by the same writer/director about a group of criminals playing off each other after a heist gone wrong. And when the Dogs are arguing, stressing out, fighting in that werehouse, you can truly see the roots of Tarantino's style, because anything that takes place in that warehouse truly had me hooked. Me White and Mr Pink are definitely the standouts, with both actors giving a brilliant performance and their squabbles feeling realistic and tense. However, the film begins to lose steam once the story begins to flash back, showing dull and uninteresting scenes that feel as if they were only included to get the picture to an hour and a half. These sequences truly drags the movie down as the conversations aren't nearly as compelling, and feel unneeded as they hardly shed any light on the current situation that couldn't have been told through the chafacgers in the werehouse. Ultimately, Reservoir Dogs is passable, and a decent first effort for the genius that is Quentin Tarantino, but it pales in comparison to his later works, as I feel there's nothing here that memorable or interesting.",6,1,2,4 August 2018
Pulp Fiction," Cinematic Masterpiece?
","What's to say about this movie that hasn't already been said? This is the best example in cinema history of character building and fantastic dialogue. You have to give credit to the genius that is Quentin Tarantino when he can take a relatively uneventful and straight forward narrative and pull it out of order and craft amazing characters in order to make it one of the best movies of all time. So quotable, so well acted, so iconic, truly one of the best scripts put to film!",9,1,2,4 August 2018
Joker," Worthy of all the praise it can get
","What is there to say about this movie that hasn't already been said? Joker is a meticulous, expertly crafted piece of art, in terms of writing, direction, cinematography, and especially performance. Every element of this film is a solid piece of the framework and each lends their strengths to each other in a way that hasn't been seen in a comic book movie before.From Pheonix's heart-wrenching, mesmerizing, and terrifying performance, to the tension building, tragic score, to the harsh depth of field that leaves the viewer in a dream-land, as if everything in the world is an illusion. There isn't a single element of Joker that isn't filled with passion and careful consideration. A week after seeing it and I've done nothing but think about each element more and more - it's a story that begs for repeat viewings, filled to the brim with detail, leaving space for theorizing and conspiring, the perfect way to do a Joker origin movie:'If I'm going to have a past, I'd rather it be multiple choice'The only slight downfalls of this near masterpiece is that in some parts it can feel a little repetitive, and it does heavily borrow from Scorcese films such as Taxi Driver & King of Comedy, but ultimately these are minor nitpicks in an unforgettable, unsettling, and thought-provoking narrative that will continue to be discussed and theorised for years.Filled with quotables, memorable moments, shocking moments, shocking moments with hints of Joker comedy, this is definitely the perfect Joker origin story, as well as an important message/warning to society regarding the 1%.",10,2,3,12 October 2019
It Chapter Two," A flip on everything that made Chapter 1 so entertaining...
","It Chapter 2 is one of the most disappointing films of the year - a confused, amateur, meandering mess that drags it's thin plot out for an unnecessary 2 hours and 50 minutes, with pointless characters, beyond predictable twists, and not to mention, the most cliché, uninspired, and ineffective scares I've seen in a while. FYI, loud music, booming sound effects, and an over abundance of CGI aren't chilling, just loud and predictable.Not one element of this film holds up to the original, with only 3 Pennywise moments standing out as entertaining parts of the movie, and Bill Hader doing a good job as an older version of Richie, even if his younger counterpart is still the funnier of the 2.Speaking of the characters, their older counterparts are incredibly one note and shells of their original selves - Bill is the guilty hero, Mike is the one with the information, Eddie is the worrier, Richie is the comedian, and as for Ben and Beverly....they weren't given a shred of depth besides 'in a love triangle with Bill, who would be cheating on his wife if he were to show any interest in this rushed and bland side plot.' It appears the screenwriter has lost his flow with this instalment as even scenes with the younger Losers Club are no where near as charming of hilarious as they were last time, only acting as exposition in repetitive transition moments which are supposed to provide character moments, but instead do nothing but drag out this thin 'find your artefact' plot with its tired technique.The main issue however is just that the movie feels confused - what little horror is actually in this movie is severely overshadowed by forced comedic moments (even within these sequences themselves, seriously, when the Deadpool song began playing in what was meant to be a disturbing moment, it felt completely out of place) and fantasy elements, with an unbearable score that reeked or cliché adventure movie.In conclusion, It chapter 2 is an uninspired and uninteresting follow up to one of the greatest horror films of the decade with only a few memorable scenes to offer to the story.",3,2,4,11 September 2019
Jackie Brown," Underrated Tarantino
","Jackie Brown is often considered one of Tarantino's weaker projects. While I believe that this viewpoint does hold some truth, it still doesn't take away from the fact that it's still riddled with his charm, uniqueness, and genius.Tarantino's usual strengths are here - engrossing, realistic dialogue, interesting presentation & cinematography, amazing score, and entertaining characters. It's these attributes that make sitting through Tarantino run times worth it.However, for the first, and possibly only time in his career, Tarantino's own style works against him in Jackie Brown. The screenplay is an adaptation of the book 'rum punch', which features a story that would benefit from Tarantino breaking away from his usual style at points. The two styles do actually go together pretty flawlessly in roughly the first hour of the film - the characters are all introduced in an entertaining and informative fashion, and they all seemed pretty distinct and memorable, partly due to the spot on acting by everyone involved (although mostly Samuel L Jackson & Robert De Niro). However, once Jackie begins to go rogue and scheme on pretty much everyone else in the film, the film began to lose me a little.The 'one woman against the world' plot presented in Jackie Brown would truly benefit from Tarantino really getting into Brown's head, but his laid back style doesn't quite allow for that, making many of Brown's decisions confuse me just as much as it confused her opponents in the story. As an audience, we can be surprised by our protagonist, but we shouldn't be confused. As a result, the story structure and direction left me questioning most of Jackie's decisions in the second and third act, making me feel detached from her, and her partner Max Cherry - when the film really would have benefitted from making us truly root for Jackie through getting a glimpse into her psyche, not just because she's the title character.The film is also full of long shots. At best these make the film extremely interesting to watch unfold, but can sometimes leave the film with the feeling that it's meandering a little - the film, much like many other Tarantino films, could lose around 10 minutes.Despite the slightly lackluster protagonist and meandering moments, Jackie Brown is still definitely another quality film in Tarantino's catalogue, filled to the brim with life and character, and a story that is undeniably interesting once all the pieces fall into place. 7/10.",7,0,1,3 June 2020
Incredibles 2," Better than the Avengers?
","Featuring better action than most superhero movies these days, and just being a thrill ride from start to finish, the Incredibles 2 is worthy of its spot in today's wave of comic book action movies, with likeable, grounded characters (apart from Bob, who comes across selfish and unlikeable for a large chunk of the film, but is redeemed by the final act), who all get their moments, with frozone and elastigirl being the standouts this time. The villain plot can be picked apart with a crowbar, from the motivations, to the whole first half on their plan being completely pointless. However, they do their job in getting the characters to a thrilling climax that puts most live action action sequences to shame, so the villain plot can be seen as a necessary sacrifice.Overall, the Incredibles 2 is a fun, light hearted roller coaster and a nice refresher in the comic book genre!",8,1,4,4 August 2018
