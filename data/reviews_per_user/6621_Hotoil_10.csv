Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Cold and unengaging, if visually stunning
","George Lucas reminds me of a politician.  Some of them start out honest enough but when they get power, they go nuts with it.  Lucas' power is his technology, and he sure is losing it.'Phantom Menace' seems like his way of showing off just how much he can do with computers and how little he can do with real human actors and emotions. The droids in the first film were deeper than the people in this one.Yes, Episode 4 wasn't the deepest or most original story ever told, but it had a heart behind it's visual splendor that still holds strong today. 'Phantom Menace' was dead on arrival.  Hopefully, the negative feedback this film has recieved will have a positive impact on the next installment.",Null,0,1,8 March 2001
Fight Club," Eh...
","A movie that rants against consumerism but features paid product placement? It's dumb to just pick at that point because the film is, in essense, hypocritical, being a big-budget Hollywood flick that supposedly preaches against it's very being.  But of course, one could easily argue that it needed to be what it was to say what it did on such a large scale.Sorry, I thought it was lame; if anything, it might make some unsuspecting viewers realize and think about things they might not have before.  But in a lot of ways, it seemed like it was only discrediting what many people feel it was trying to say.  So it was either anti-revolutionary or faux-revolutionary...",Null,0,2,22 March 2001
American Pie," Dumb movies for dumb people
","Very lame and unoriginal film; just another teen gross-out/sex movie, of which there have been waaaaay too many lately, all too similar - people have had sex with food in better movies (read BETTER, not actually good).  I've read that this is actually the 'defining' movie of my generation.  Pretty unnerving.",Null,0,1,25 May 2001
Moulin Rouge!," Big Empty Eye Candy
","What better example of all style, no substance?  And it helps that this is as abstract a movie as most of it's likely audience is to have ever seen. I'm sure this movie wouldn't have gone over very well at all if not for Ewen being such a charming b****rd & some of the goofy, slapstick moments being so crowd pleasing.  Still, it's little more than a hyperactive sitcom in the beginning, and a conventional romance in the end.  The only thing that sets it apart from the other crap in Hollywood is it's distracting presentation. DISTRACTING at best, never uniquely artistic (as it seems to want you to believe).  If you enjoy it, all power to you - but you're likely to see right through it.",Null,2,4,8 June 2001
Empire Records," As bad as it gets
","A variety of cliche plots.  Stereotypical characters. A generally horrible film!  It really plays like a bad sitcom.  Hell, just about every theme and plot twist has previously played out in about a hundred old sitcoms in the past. If you've never watched TV before, you might find some of this original and unpredictable. I guess it's supposed to be one of those 'fun romps' that your not supposed to think about and just enjoy.  Sorry, but you'll need to go the extra mile and get a lobotomy!Sheltered suburban kids who have fun in malls and like to buy their rebellion will love it!",1,5,13,25 November 2000
Jerry Maguire," Almost? I'm not sure.
","It always feels like it's building towards something, and it has it's moments, but it unfortunately goes nowhere but to a sappy, sugary ending and a walk off into the sunset.First of all, Tom Cruise can't convince me of much.  IN 'Born on the 4th of July', he was good as the naive kid signing up to 'serve his country', but as the jaded veteran who realized the harsh realities and political motivations behind war, he began to wear thin.  Here, he's great as the cocky, successfull agent, but as soon as that job falls through Cruise's performance seems to follow.  He pulls through in moments of anger, but otherwise it's uneven and even at times spooky.Cuba Gooding Jr. does play his role very well.  Renee Zellwegger...well, I know she's a better actress then what we see here.  I think it's the writing that just demands her to play the same stupid emotion in every other scene. Her son, in the movie, is so over-the-top cute that at times you expect a studio audience to start piping in with 'aaaaw's.  This is good or bad, depending on your outlook and cynicism (obviously I have too much of the latter).  The best acting in the film actually comes from those in the much-ridiculed 'divorced women's group' that pops in and out of the movie - those scenes actually come off a little too realistic in a film where the main characters are anything but.This film just takes on too much, doesn't explore enough and tacks on the ending that it knows will make mainstream audiences happy but hardly completes the story.  What it needed was more dialogue.  Too many scenes were just 'this is what happens' and not 'this is how it is going to happen'.  The only scenes that they let hang are those where Cruise and Zellwegger start kissing.  Could have explored more through dialogue, but I guess there were so many themes in the movie there just wasn't enough time.",Null,3,11,15 March 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," Eye Candy that strives for artsy but comes up empty
","Yes, it is of course uneventful, but thats not the problem...uneventful is okay, as long as it is thought-provoking and entertaining - but this film was laughable.  We get to take a trip inside the mind of a rich yuppie doctor as he questions love, fedelity, and sexuality - it doesn't help that he is played by Tom Cruise.  Plus, we also get to witness Stanley Kubrick at his most boring and self-indulgent, as if he is trying hard to be as artsy as possible but instead just comes off as *trying* to be artsy.  Instead, it's just boring and contrived.It's slow, yes, but so were '2001' and 'Dr. Strangelove' - but they were decent films with rich subject matter.  This was boring, empty effort. Also, it is one of his only films that takes place in regular, everyday society in modern times - a problem for Kubrick, who had been a recluse for many, many years prior and his more recent films (aside from 'Full Metal Jacket', which he wrote from research) have usually delt with alternate or futuristic worlds.  Maybe it wouldn't have hurt had he gone into the city and gotten a cup of coffee before penning a script like this.  Maybe it would have come off as a bit more believable where the result is more...i don't know...laughable.It looks and feels like a Kubrick film, but it hardly leaves the impression of a good one.",Null,0,1,20 March 2001
Titanic," Big & Empty
","I have always been fascinated by the story of the Titanic, and I had high hopes for this film.  Unfortunately, what I got was a cold, mindless Hollywood romance flick that merely used the Titanic as a springboard to emptier things.I found it less than moving.  The romantic storyline was nothing new at all, and the acting and dialogue was generally laughable.  What did work?  It has lots of pretty faces, elaborate set-design and special effects, plus looks and feels 'epic' (with no substance to back it up).Just a big, empty romance-disaster movie here.  If your interested in the story of the Titanic, read about it in books, there is little here we don't already know and the focus is mainly on the characters, who are no more than one-dimensional stereotypes.",Null,3,5,18 March 2001
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," It's a favorite, but it has it easy...
","Of course most fans and critics like this one the best - it's got it easy! The first film set it all up, the next one would resolve any loose-ends - this gets to focus purely on the action!  Nevertheless, the action scenes were more interesting than those in the previous film, and Frank Oz gives us the most sincere performance of the trilogy through his Yoda puppet, who gets ample screen time here.It doesn't have much of a beginning or ending (no ending really), just some necessary preperation for the big finale, 'Return of the Jedi', loads of tedious action sequences and a showcase of special effects.  This is the best installment in the 'Special Edition', because it is the only one where Lucas didn't go overboard and the enhancements don't stick out like a sore thumb.  But as for the trilogy in general, the first was the only fulfilling film and 'Jedi' provided the only suspense - this was merely filler, but good if action-packed battles are your thing.",Null,0,0,18 March 2001
High Fidelity," A nice, smooth ride
","This is a really funny, well-made, great film.  They marketed this thing very poorly - when I first saw the trailer in the theaters I thought it would be one movie I would be happy to miss.  A friend of mine snuck it into our selection of movie rentals one night, and I was very pleasantly surprised!I generally like John Cusack, as I am gradually discovering.  I thought 'Gross Point Blank' was a nice flick, and 'Being John Malkovich' just blew me away.  This strangely finds it's place in between the two.  I don't know why, but the rhythm of the film is nice, it has many randomly funny parts, it's believable & realistic while being completely outrageous and always enjoyable.  The supporting cast is great, Jack Black stays extremely funny without getting as annoying as the character he plays (if teetering on the edge).The movie has two central themes: relationships and music.  John Cusack is wonderful as he hashes the two out in his mind, for the viewing audience to see and hear.  I admit, this is a risky film.  It could have easily gone bad - it's a great script that needed the perfect lead and a nice cast to really pull it off.  It does.A previous comment mistakenly advises the reader that 'Empire Records' is a good alternative to this film.  It would probably be best to disregard that suggestion completely.  Unlike Empire Records, with which this movie has about two thin cosmetic similarities, 'High Fidelity' doesn't come off like a bad sitcom with stereotypical, marketing-induced plots and characters. This is one of John Cusack's best movies indeed! it is smart and simple, has a certain subtle charm, a great cast and a witty and relatable script. Enjoy it!",10,0,1,25 November 2000
