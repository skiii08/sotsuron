Alien 3," I actually liked it
","With all the negative reviews 'Alien 3' was getting my expectations were very low.To my surprise,I thought the movie was good,sure there are flaws,but the general idea was very nice-different then the first movie and 'Aliens'.The fact that this film takes the franchise in a new direction means this wasn't a cash-in sequel-effort was put into it.So,what makes the third installment different then the previous.Well,the film creates a rather sad and depressing atmosphere.I think this is one of the reasons people hate 'Alien 3' so much,it ruins the happy ending of 'Aliens'.And sure,the way it kills of Hicks and Newt is a little cheap,but necessary for the sad tone of the film and it also prevents further overflow of characters.That brings us to the next complaint a lot of people have-too many characters.I think the characters that needed to be developed-Clemens,Dillon and Ripley get adequate character development.The romance between Ripley and Clemens does seem unnatural and kinda forced and it's one of the things I didn't like about the film.Although 'Alien 3' doesn't have the constant suspense of the first film or the thrilling scenes of 'Aliens' it manages to create a feeling of helplessness and constant dread.Think about it,'Alien' took place on a space ship,which is isolated and far away from help,but you can get on an escape pod and blow the ship up anytime you want(which they did).'Aliens' takes place on a remote colony,but they had weapons and a ship in orbit.'Alien 3' takes place in a prison in the a** end of space and they have no weapons.Sure,the alien itself,may not be very shocking.In some scenes it's CG(I think that's because I watched the assembly cut,I'm not sure how it was in the original).I think people are being to harsh on 'Alien 3'.The movie is not that bad and it's worth taking a look at.",8,3,4,5 January 2013
Star Trek," It's...different
","It's safe to say that the 2009 reboot of 'Star Trek' has little to do with anything else 'Star Trek' related in terms of overall tone,though it does make some references to The Original Series-that's pretty much it.I think that is the main reason why many hardcore trekkies disliked this movie-they expected something more familiar and nostalgic and were disappointed whit this new approach,so the fans completely ignored the good parts of the film and instead started nitpicking.I read some of the negative reviews and I saw people criticizing the name 'red mater',come on guys,if it was called tri-nuclear-gravitational-monocrappular- thingofapoop would you be happier,I mean,when was anything science related ever criticized in a 'Star Trek' film.I mean no disrespect,of course,everyone has their own opinion.I am not a hardcore 'Star Trek' fan,but I can see why those who are felt cheated,but,in my opinion,this movie was orientated more towards younger viewers,who weren't that familiar with the 'Star Trek' universe.",8,0,1,5 January 2013
Alien: Resurrection," In space no one can hear you suck
","When I saw the first 10 minutes of this movie,my first reaction was 'Is this some kind of joke???'.Well if it was a joke,it would have been in very poor taste,unfortunately it's not.I would like to point out,I was completely alright with how 'Alien 3' ended and I liked the movie itself,sure it wasn't as good as the original and 'Aliens',but for me it was a satisfying way to end the series.'Alien:Resurrection' was completely unnecessary and the film itself seems more like a spoof than a sequel.First of all-the characters are flat.They are also inconsistent-One minuter Winona Ryder's character tries to give Ripley support and the next she literally says 'F**k you' to Ripley.The black guy can do his fancy ricocheting bullets thingy,but he can't shoot a giant alien right in front of him.It seems the writers forgot what character development was until half-way into the film,where there is actually an attempt of giving the characters some depth,but then the writers said 'F**k it,let's throw in some more aliens!Better yet,let's throw in a last minute explanation to create a new alien.Oh this is a good one,let's make the viewers sympathise for the damn thing,although they've seen it for less then 10 minutes.'What were they thinking???Another huge problem is the CGI-it sucks,but the director doesn't seem to agree,because there are so many pointless CGI scenes,but the movie was made in a period when Hollywood thought CGI was incredibly realistic and awesome.Some of the death scenes are creative,but really over-the- top and ridiculous.The suspense from the previous films is also missing.'Alien:Resurrection' is one of the worst sequels I have ever seen.Stay the hell away from it.",1,3,5,6 January 2013
Blade," A very dark and stylish comic book adaptation
","When I watched this movie I knew,that Blade was a Marvel superhero.I haven't read any of his comic books,but I am familiar with the character himself.The only other marvel movies I have watched so far were the 'Spider-man' films and 'Captain America-The First Avenger'.I was surprised to see that'Blade' was much darker and unlike many Marvel films,it makes you take it seriously.The Story was interesting and the characters,surprisingly,did not feel underdeveloped.The thing I liked the most however was the dark and haunting atmosphere the movie manages to create.In a couple of scenes ,where characters are introduced to the us,you can get a basic impression of what personality they have,without them even saying a word.Now that is impressive.The acting was alright,Wesley Snipes turned in the best performance,in my opinion.I did not like the fight scenes that much,however.I mean,they were alright,not that over the top,but the blood effects kinda sucked.Other then that,there were the typical cheesy one liners,but,thankfully,not a lot.Overall,'Blade' is a dark,stylish and very entertaining action/thriller.",7,0,1,23 November 2012
Terminator Salvation," Salvation-The Damnation of The Terminator Series
","I went into this movie with an open mind.'Terminator 3:Rise of The Machines' was criticized a lot,but it was a good action film,so I had hopes for 'Salvation'.Plus,it should have been good,because the people who made this,seem to have gotten what the people's main problem with 'Rise of The Machines' was-the tone wasn't serious enough.'Terminator:Salvation' it seems,tries to keep a serious tone,but that greatly backfires.Why?Because the movie is nothing more than a poorly constructed amalgamation of action clichés.The characters are painfully underdeveloped.The scenes,where there should have been character development are cut short.It's like,one character starts a conversation,then there is silence,then the scene cut's away.It's like they cut out parts of the scenes.The next major problem this movie has is the dialog.Sometimes it's written really stupidly,other times it's incredibly cliché.At some points there are awkwardly long pauses and sometimes the scene cuts away for no reason,as I mentioned above.Some of the acting is downright horrible.Although I haven't watched any of the Batman movies,I can tell that Christian Bale seems to have forgotten,that he is not in a Batman film.The action scenes are inferior to the previous films and the CGI doesn't seem to help much,either.One major disappointment for me,was that there was no distinct villain,as each of the previous films had one.The T-800 appears for about 10 minutes and does pretty much what all the terminators have done until that point.Skynet appears for a brief time and also,it doesn't do much.The part where Skynet talks to Marcus is actually not that bad and it made me think,that the ending was going to be good,or at least decent,but alas,there was a major plot hole,that ruined it all.How could have the T-800 survived being covered in molten metal.Plus,it's the alloy they make the terminators from,so I assume you require a higher temperature to melt it,than regular steel,but the T-1000 died after getting dropped in molten metal,that was not in the future and it was a more advanced model.To make matters even worse,the movie ends with one of the biggest clichés ever.'Terminator:Salvation' lacks any of the qualities of the previous films and was a major disappointment for me.",2,1,2,27 December 2012
The Terminator," Worthy of it's fame
","I've heard a lot about 'The Terminator',about it being one of the greatest action films ever made,all the iconic lines like 'I will be back',but I never really had a chance to see it,until now.And I must say,it did not disappoint.The plot is very creative and although it might seem confusing at first with all the time travel and stuff,the story is quite easy to follow and it sucks you in pretty quickly.You will not feel bored a single minute while watching this movie.The action scenes are awesome and ,in my opinion,choosing Arnold Schwarzenegger for the role of the terminator was ingenious,as emoting isn't exactly his strong suite,but that's exactly what is needed for such a role.What really surprised me,was how low the budget for this film was-only 6.4 million!When you look at the movie,it seems that far more cash was thrown in to it.I especially liked the stop-motion terminator near the end,it was done extremely well.Overall,'The Terminator' is a movie worthy of it's reputation,I strongly recommend it.",10,4,5,22 December 2012
Blade II," Follows a different formula...and succeeds
","The problem with horror movie sequels nowadays is that they are so repetitive.Take the 'Final Destination' movies for example.Every one of them is pretty much just a rehash of the original,only the setting differs.With 'Blade II',however,that is not the case.In the beginning of the film we get a recap from the previous one.People who have watched the original may find this unnecessary and a little annoying,but it didn't really bother me that much.Shortly after the recap blade finds Whistler and rescues him(I won't go into more details).At first I thought that was an enormous plot hole,but it's explained withing the first half hour.The fight scenes are choreographed better and they don't use CGI as much as in in the original.When they do use CGI,it's way better than the first movie.We don't get that much character development and the main focus is on Blade and Nyssa.The thing I liked the most about 'Blade II' was the plot twist near the end of the film.The ending itself is much more dramatic than in the original.That said,the film doesn't quite end on a happy note,but I won't spoil it for you.'Blade II' is a very well made action/horror flick and a rare case where the sequel is better than the original.",8,0,16,29 November 2012
Alien," A very effective and well made horror film
","Nowadays horror films just throw CG blood and gore in your face or they try to gross you out in some other way.I thought that 'Alien' was likely to be the starter of this trend(Aliens that burst out of people's chest- plenty of opportunity for gore).However,I was surprised to discover,that 'Alien' is a very well made and brilliantly executed movie.Although the film was made with a fairly low budget,it does everything in it's power to look like a professional piece of work and in that regard it succeeds greatly.The cinematography is amazing,the camera is always focused in such a way,that when the alien appears,it catches the viewer off guard,even if he was expecting to see the alien in that scene.The perfect example for this is a scene near the end,when Ripley is already aboard the shuttle and thinks the alien is gone.The creature is actually sleeping between some pipes,but they made his head resemble the pipes so well,that I was really shocked when the alien awoke.Unlike many horror films these days,the characters aren't just cannon fodder.We also have a very likable protagonist-Ellen Ripley.Each character has a distinct personality and I liked how they would often come to conflict,like in the scene,where they are arguing whether or not they should bring Kane back to the ship.The pacing is a little slow in the first 20 minutes,but I think this is necessary for the sake of introducing us to the characters and creating some build-up.There is a pretty good plot-twist near the end,but I wont spoil it.The film doesn't just rely on cheap scares.There are a lot of very suspenseful moments and some very disturbing scenes.The scene where the alien kills Lambert,for example.Alien is a great horror film.It's well made and suspenseful.I strongly recommend it.",10,0,1,29 December 2012
Predator," Nice action movie,but it has some flaws
","'Predator' is one of the most famous Schwarzenegger movies.The movie has it's fair share of one-liners and let's not forget the iconic 'Get to da choppa!'.To my surprise,however,the film isn't really that cheesy,sure it has over-the-top moments here and there,but it actually crates a genuine feeling of suspense throughout nearly the entire length of the film.The suspense the movie manages to create is also quite subtle at first.The Predator is not revealed to us until about an hour into the film,but we know that he is stalking the group of commandos.My main complaint is the music.For a lot of scenes it just seems really unnatural,I can't explain it that well,it's just that the music doesn't fit the scene you are watching.The characters are also a problem.Some of them are plain annoying and you won't care much if they die.The action scenes are very nice,Schwarzenegger throws in a one-liner here and there.The last 15 minutes of the film are also pretty intense.Overall,this is a very good action/sci-fi/thriller,despite it's flaws.",8,0,2,4 January 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Been waiting a long time to see this
","For some reason I was never very interested in 'The Lord of the Rings' franchise and every time me and my friend discussed movies he would point out that I haven't watched some of the most well known films ever made,so I finally decided to see 'The Lord of the Rings' for myself.The plot was alright,though I didn't find it to be very innovative,however it was well structured and consistent.Even if the movie has a 3 hour run time I never felt as if it was moving too slow,while watching it.The thing that I thought could have been done better was the character development.It's not the characters are underdeveloped,it's just that I expected something more from that 3 hour run time.The CGI is amazing.I couldn't believe,that I was watching a film,made in 2001.The thing I liked the most,however,was that some of the scenes were very powerful.The scene where Frodo says he will take the ring and the 'You shall not pass!!!' scene are the perfect example for this.I didn't like the fight scenes very much,however.I mean,they were kinda cool,but I think they abuse slow motion a little too much.This is not a big complaint,however.Overall,'The Lord of the Rings:The Fellowship of the Ring' is a very well made film.And though not the epic masterpiece a lot of people claim it to be,I can see why it's considered one of the best fantasy movies ever made.",8,1,3,15 November 2012
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Two hours of awesomeness
","When I saw the first movie,I was surprised what an amazing movie James Cameron was able to create with such a small budget.When I went to see 'Judgment Day',I was curious to see how Cameron would use a much bigger budget.He uses it to it's full extent.The result is a truly unique movie.This film focuses more on the characters-The T-101,Sarah and John Connor and they're all likable.I especially liked how the Terminator discovers the value of life,but eventually sacrifices himself in the end.That was one of the most powerful scenes I have seen in a movie.We also have a more intimidating villain-the T-1000.Don't get me wrong,Arnold was still very Intimidating in the first movie,but you can never see the T- 1000 coming,it can change into everything and uses cunning instead of smashing as it's primary tool.This is probably the most entertaining and fun-to-watch movie I have ever seen.In my review for the first film I mentioned,that you will not feel bored for a single minute while watching,well,you wont feel bored for a single second while watching 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day'.Sure,the movie has some cheesy moments here and there,but I think that's what gives it it's distinct terminatorness,what makes it so enjoyable.",10,4,5,26 December 2012
Aliens," Different concept than the original-fantastic idea,but hindered by some minor flaws
","One of the main problem of many horror movie franchises is their repetitive nature.Many sequels to horror films,successful enough to spawn them, are usually a rehash of the original with few new ideas.If they decide to take the franchise in a different direction,however,there is a very high chance that it will be an even greater failure(like 'Halloween 3',for example).In this regard,Cameron chose the second path and I must say,'Aliens' is a very well made and entertaining movie.It's a little more action oriented than the original,but that doesn't mean,there aren't suspenseful scenes,either.Unlike the original,Ripley is clearly the protagonist of the film from the very beginning.Her character is further developed and that aspect of the movie was done perfectly.The movie has a higher budget than the first and it is utilized very well.We see more of the aliens and we get more background on them.As I mentioned before,there are more action scenes,which are done very well.What I didn't like about the film,was that at some points it was kinda over-the-top and cheesy.I have seen this in other Cameron films,such as 'Terminator 2:Judgment Day',but the cheesy moments are a distinct part of 'The Terminator',but in 'Aliens' they stick out like a sore thumb.This is most distinct in the scene where the marines awake from cryogenic sleep.I get,that their behavior is supposed to explain to us,that they don't know what they're up against,but I think Cameron went a little too far.Overall,'Aliens' is a very well made and entertaining film and while it's not better than the original,it's definitely a worthy sequel.",9,1,2,30 December 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Flawed,but not that bad
","I went to see 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' yesterday.It is one of the most anticipated movies of 2012 and when it finally came out,there was a major difference between the user and critic rating,probably the biggest I have seen on the IMDb.This made me even more curious to see what the movie was like.To be completely honest,the movie didn't disappoint me,but it wasn't exactly what I was expecting.I haven't read Mr.Tolkien's book,so I don't know how well the movie follows it,but in terms of story it was alright,although there are several things that weren't really explained,but hopefully they will be clarified in the later movies.The film,however,has several fatal flaws,that ruin the overall experience:1.Too many characters.If you remember,the fellowship of the ring consisted of 9 characters :Frodo,Gandalf,Legolas,Gimley,Aragorn,Boromir,Sam and the other two hobbits.Gimley,the dwarf,was there manly to provide comedic relief.If there is one character like that-it's okay.Now imagine a company of 14 people,well,a hobbit,dwarfs and a wizard,if you want to be precise,and eleven of them are Gimley like characters.You just can't take it seriously with someone constantly falling,belching,breaking chairs,due to their excessive weight and so on,and so on.2.References to modern things,that you will never,ever see in a film like this.I think 'Aladdin' started this trend and sure,back then it was fun,but now it's just plain annoying.Plus,I never,in a million years expected to see this in a Peter Jackson movie,or any movie connected to 'The Lord of The Rings' franchise' for that matter.3.A very,very stupid beginning.I promise you,in the first 30 minutes of 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' you will not be able to take the movie seriously,no matter how hard you try.The whole part is just so over-the-top and cheesy,did they get a different director for that segment,because no sane individual,unless he was under the effect of hallucinogenic substances,could approve of something like this.What were they thinking???Despite all it's flaws,The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' has a charm to it.You know the movie is flawed,but you just can't bring yourself to hate it.To the film's credit,it actually gets pretty good in the final 20 minutes.From the game of riddles scene to the very end,the movie is a non-stop pleasure cruise.",6,4,15,15 December 2012
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Corrects most of the mistakes the first movie made
","When I watched 'The Fellowship of The Ring',the first entry in the LOTR trilogy,I thought it was a very good adventure movie,but there were two flaws that kept me from rating it 10/10-the characters didn't have the amount of development I expected(from a 3 hour movie) and some of the fight scenes seemed kind of over the top and abused slow motion way too much .Although these flaws weren't that major,they did kinda spoiled the experience for me.'The Two Towers' corrects these flaws and manages to create an almost perfect epic.The characters feel as if they got the development they needed.I especially liked the new character the movie introduced to us- Gollum. He was,in my opinion, a very complex and well thought out character and from now on-my favorite character in the franchise(before that it was Gimli).The fight scenes are also done better,than in the previous film.Most of them are battles of epic proportions,rather then just the fellowship fighting a larger group as it was in the previous film.They still abuse slow motion a little too much,though,and they actually use the Wilhelm scream at one point.Overall,'The Two Towers' is a worthy sequel,that even manages to surpass it's precursor.",9,0,1,25 November 2012
Event Horizon," The most frightening,effective and disturbing horror movie I have ever seen
","I had extremely low expectations for 'Event Horizon'.The film was made in a period where a lot of filmmakers thought that when you have enough money to use and abuse CGI your movie doesn't need a decent script.With that in mind I thought 'Event Horizon' was going to be a cliché horror film that makes no effort to build suspense and just throws CG blood and gore in your face.I was wrong.Dead wrong.'Event Horizon' is the creepiest and most suspenseful horror movie I have ever seen.It manages to create a feeling of dread and foreboding like no other film I have ever seen before.This is due to a combination of great camera-work,appropriate music and(believe it or not) CG.Yes,the CGI is actually used appropriately here,not just added for the sake of it being there.That said,the special effects are top-notch(for 1997).Another thing I liked was that the ship itself wasn't the main threat.It was the characters.They become obsessed with their past mistakes(things they had locked away in their minds and didn't want to remember) and that begins to drive them insane.True,the ship is the catalyst for this,but the focus is more on the characters themselves.This reminds me of 'Cube'-one of my favorite movies.The characters themselves are a bit underdeveloped,but they aren't cannon fodder like in many other horror films.Each of them has their the distinct personality and background information is given about some of them.I think this was alright for the purpose of this film.In my opinion ,if they did add more character development it would have ruined the pacing.'Event Horizon' is a very well made,but sadly underrated, horror movie.I strongly recommend it.",10,25,40,20 January 2013
A Clockwork Orange," A truly unique film
","I think it's absolutely pointless writing a review for this movie.There are so many others,that there is no way I won't cover what has already been covered.I am writing this review,because I saw 'A clockwork orange' yesterday and no other movie that I have watched until this moment,except 'Pulp Fiction',maybe, has left me in awe.I am amazed how much this movie covers.It handles problems in all aspects of society, yet it manages to be a very well structured and entertaining movie.It was made 40 years ago,but feels so up to date.The characters,especially the protagonist are very unique.But then again,everything about this movies is.This a must-see,truly an amazing film. I would give it 11/10 if I could.",10,0,1,14 October 2012
Ice Age: Continental Drift," Another unnecessary sequel
","Pixar is really in the mood for releasing crappy sequels.First 'Cars 2',now this.Let's look at the previous ice age movies.The first one was pretty good.I liked the idea and the characters were interesting.The second one focused mainly on the Development of Manny and Diego,not as good as the first one,but still decent.The third one was a little ridiculous with the whole dinosaur thing,but still watchable.Then there is this.The sequel that ruined the series for me.There is zero character development,except for Manny's daughter and her nerdy boyfriend,but tell me,does anyone give a damn about them-NO! We want to see the characters we like going on adventures and stuff like that.Well,they do go on an adventure,a very boring one.When I saw the villain of this movie I couldn't believe my eyes.Sure ice age is a comedy,but the previous films at least took their villains somewhat seriously.There is some romance subplot between Diego and another saber-tooth,but guess what-it goes nowhere.As for positive qualities,the CGI and voice-acting are top notch,naturally,this was made by Pixar after all.This,and the fact,that the there were some funny jokes here and there is the only reason I'm giving this movie 4 stars.Overall,you won't miss much if you don't watch this.",4,1,3,12 October 2012
Prometheus," Where did they go wrong?
","With all the other reviews for this it seems pointless writing another,but I felt the need to express my opinion about this movie.First,I would like to point out,that I haven't watched any of the 'Alien' movies and I went into 'Prometheus' completely blind.The general idea of the movie,the origin of mankind,intrigues me.The special effects are top-notch and the acting is decent too,so what's wrong with this film - The way everything develops,unfolds.The characters are not developed that well and some of the plot points never come to a conclusion.It's obvious that they want to make a sequel,but when you make the viewers ask themselves so many questions and leave them unanswered it will just anger them.Combine that with the high expectations and you can see why a lot of people hate 'Prometheus'.In my opinion,the movie is not that bad and is worth a watch,even if you aren't an 'Alien' fan.In fact,I think,that if you aren't an 'Alien' fan you will find this movie better.",6,0,0,30 October 2012
The Iron Giant," Probably the best animated film ever made
","I can't really think of the adequate words to describe how amazing this film is,I am truly left in awe after watching it,something I never expected from an animated movie.'The Iron Giant' is...flawless.The story is very compelling.The characters - very well developed and the animation is very good too.When there is humor,it's actually very funny, even for older viewers. This is one of the few animated films that will be as interesting to kids ,as it would be to adults.You will find that the story sucks you in very quickly.I will admit,I nearly cried in the end. This is,in my opinion, one of the best animated movies ever made,sadly it never was a big hit when it was released.'The Iron Giant' is a must- see,regardless of what age you are.",10,0,1,1 November 2012
Final Destination," Has it's ups and downs
","I can't really say that 'Final Destination' is a bad movie,but it's not anything special either.What I liked the most about this film was the idea-everyone's destiny being predetermined and what would happen if you 'cheat' death.I thought it was very creative.The only characters you will probably care about are Alex,the protagonist,Clear,the love interest(sort of) and Carter,the a**hole.These three characters are the only ones that get any kind of development.Everyone else is pretty much cannon fodder.I didn't quite like the death scenes,though.The special effects were decent,but the scenes themselves seemed kind of implausible.The scene that irritates me the most is the death of the teacher,Ms.Lewton.I mean,she sees smoke coming from her computer and what does she do,walk towards it very slowly,how stupid do you have to be to do that.As much as I criticize the death scenes,they are somewhat suspenseful.The whole movie is,especially in the final 10 minutes.'Final Destination' is an alright movie and it's a lot better than most teenage horror flicks out there.",6,0,0,5 November 2012
Cube," Very original,very suspenseful
","I didn't know what to think of 'Cube' before watching it,I stumbled across the movie randomly as I was browsing IMDb.After watching this movie,I was surprised how original and well thought out it was.Unlike many recent horror movies,'Cube' lacks any special effects and relies mainly on the unknown,the unseen as method to scare the living hell out of us,much like 'The Blair Witch Project'.This method was very successful,as the whole movie keeps you in suspense.Another thing I found interesting was the way the characters develop through the course of the film,I won't spoil what happens,but let's just say the personalities of two specific characters change dramatically.'Cube' is probably one of the best and most suspenseful horror movies I have ever seen,I strongly recommend it.",10,3,6,2 November 2012
Moon," Mindblowing
","Most sci-fi movies nowadays are about alien invasions,intergalactic wars,in general-the main subject is something of epic proportions.'Moon' is the exact opposite.It focuses on the life of just one man-Sam Bell.At first glance this may look like a step down,but I think it's rather refreshing to see a different type of sci-fi movie,plus,'Moon' is a very well thought out movie.The first half hour of the film moves at a rather slow pace and it made me think that the movie was trying to rip off '2001:A Space Odyssey'.After these 30 minutes have passed,however,you will see that that was not the case at all.In my opinion,'Moon' had one of the best plot twists I have ever seen.I won't spoil it for you,but it is truly mindblowing.'Moon' manages to be innovative and well structured.I strongly recommend it.",10,5,11,30 November 2012
