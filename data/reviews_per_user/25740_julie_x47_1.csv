The Avengers," Very Disappointed
","I booked tickets for this as my boyfriend wanted to catch it before it left the cinemas, and from the trailer it looked like great fun, but after a very achy backside from sitting and squirming through 2 an half hours of this tripe, bored out of my brain, just wasn't worth it! The only good thing about this film was Downy Jr, hes an incredible actor in his own right, and if it wasn't for him I'd be giving it 0/10. Just cant understand why people are soooo hyped over it, very clich√©, bad acting (apart from Jr) dialogue was atrocious, and the story has been done time and time before.. Yawn! I was expecting something sooo much more from this film and it fell flat.",3,100,209,1 June 2012
