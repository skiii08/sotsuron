The Blair Witch Project," A great found footage horror flick
","Now that we are getting a second sequel this year I finally decided to watch the OG 'Blair Witch Project'. Now that I've gotten around to it I'm glad I did. What's interesting about this film is that, even now, it remains one the most renowned horror movies ever. Yet, it's also the same movie that accrued a Razzie nomination for worst picture of the year. So which is it? Is it one of the greatest exercises in horror or one of the worst? In my humble opinion it's one the best. Although I wouldn't necessarily call it a horror. For my taste it's more of a thriller than anything. If you aren't aware, the film follows three young adults who venture into the woods in search of a story.A story for their documentary. Which explains the reason for the found footage style. Before this movie there really wasn't anything like this. And with the viral marketing suggesting that it was a legit thing, people were genuinely frightened for the cast. Apparently sending letters to the cast families expressing their condolences for their losses.Even with the excess of found footage films these days this one some how still feels fresh. This mainly has to do with the lack of gimmicks and clich√©s despite it revolutionizing a genre. There isn't any slow pan left and slow pan right followed by a jump scare. Nor is there the constant wonder as to why the characters have a camera at all times. The reason it defined a genre is because it did it so well. And now all we have is overused troupes that intend on jumping their audience to death. The thing that genuinely shocked me while watching was how the film understood that less is more. There isn't a single jump scare that I remember and there isn't a single time that you actually see the antagonist. The film understands that if it where to show the witch and sets rules for it that it would become vastly more difficult to scare you. By not having these rules set it can basically do what ever it wants without any one saying, 'That doesn't make sense.'. It helps you as the audience feel and experience whats happening through the characters perspective. As more things start to happen and they start to question what is going to happen next, so do you.This intentional lack of a monster or rules makes this incredibly unsettling to watch. It feels authentically supernatural. The performances by these three unknown actors really helped sell this even more. They aren't all that good honestly, but the writing and editing for the film made everything come across convincing and natural. Not everything here works though. As I said, the performances can be quite shaky. They clearly aren't trained actors and some of their interactions can be rather cringy. But the biggest issue I have comes from some of the characters behavior. There are many times when they act so irrational that it's near impossible to not get frustrated at the film. Like when a character tosses a valuable object into a river just because he personally deemed it 'useless'.However this film honestly shocked me. It blows me away how diversified its audience is when it comes to whether they liked it or not. It may not be that scary but it's incredibly unsettling. The film is unpredictable, natural, and uncommonly convincing. It isn't exactly a perfect horror experience due to some poor performances and questionable behavior, but it's such an interesting dive into human physique. Watching these people go completely bonkers was way more enjoyable, and unsettling than it should have been.",8,1,3,2 August 2016
The Lobster," Unconventional and hilarious.
","'The Lobster' is, as the poster says, an unconventional love story. The film is about a man named David (Colin Farrell). This man just recently lost his wife and, in this near future, that denotes being forced to try and find someone new. He his sent to a hotel where he stays for forty five days. Here he is pushed to find a new partner or be turned into a animal and released into the wild. Is this fairly outlandish and rather implausible? Sure. But once you see the film, it will all make sense. It is very strange yet it works so well. Everything 'The Lobster' does seems to have a purpose. Especially the things that feel a bit too over the top. This is what makes this film so special. The story so incredibly strange and original that it's near impossible not to be sucked into its world. The fact that everything falls into place in such a perfect manner is in large part thanks to Colin Farrell and his immensely committed performance.In fact everyone involved does a fantastic job in their own monotone roles. It's strange to be saying how great everyone is because of how little emotion these characters seem to have. It takes these great actors and tells them to do something that is incredibly hard. Be dull but not boring.Again, it's just the right amount of over the top and weird to work. What the film is actually trying to say here is open to interpretation. And there are many different things that it seems to be saying. The most predominate message that is being said is obviously about relationships. It starts in the first few moments to last few moments. It talks about how many of us see relationships and the things that are deemed 'romantic'. It's an interesting look at human nature and the way some people perceive love.With a film this ambitious there tends to be a few draw backs. The only real, noticeable down side here is in its pacing. For the most part the film moves at a great pace but there are multiple spots where the film certainly slows down. Whether it's for one reason or another is beside the point. It's just abundantly clear that there are scenes where the film slows down way to much.This is a fairly small gripe in a film that overall, is great. It's so strange and unconventional that it's near impossible not to fall in love with it. It shows the world in a hilariously dark and uncompromising way. What it lacks in accessibility it makes for with rich rewards for patient viewers.",8,1,5,11 January 2016
Howl's Moving Castle," Good if flawed
","This and 'Spirited Away' are quite possibly the two most well recognized Anime films ever made. Hayao Miyazaki is just one of those film makers that attracts all sorts of people regardless if those people like the style or not. His films are bright, vibrant, and stuffed with sci-fi type elements. 'Howls Moving Castle' is no exception to this. We start off with our main character, Sofi, being turned into a very elderly woman. Not wanting anyone to see her like this she runs away from home and becomes a maid for the mysterious wizard Howl. And now we have our movie.Just like all of Miyazaki's films this is absolutely breathtaking to look at. The hand drawn style is great on its own, but it's the detail in the world that is so impressive. Whether it's Howls gigantic moving castle that is made up of many different moving parts or the bustling streets, it's hard to be sucked in by the world.It's beautiful, bright, and filled with color. Which was nice to see considering the amount of films these days that are very bleak and void of color or life. It set the tone for the rest of the film as a fun but kind of dark tale. What really springs this world off the screen is the soundtrack.Each song is undeniably unique and perfect for each scenario in the film. It's an excellent score that doesn't force the film on you. Hayao understands that the majority of the audience can recognize subtly. So, unlike many other films, he uses the music to accent what is being seen on screen. Not to try and force you how to think or feel in a particular scene. All this helps the film move along at a shockingly brisk pace. The film is two hours long but goes by in no time at all. This has a lot to do with the previous elements that I mentioned. Really the only times it slowed was when characters decided to just spew exposition. I understand that some children need things to be spelled out for them considering that this is a kids movie but by doing this the film doesn't have any interesting characters.It says this character is like this and they are like that. It kind of sucks that the majority of the film is smart about not pushing things in your face but it doesn't even try with the characters. Instead of showing you who they are it just blatantly tells you. Then they don't really behave the way the film says they should.This happens with the story as well. It says OK we are going to do this and then this. And I can't help think that the characters they are talking to already know this. The only people that don't know what these characters are talking about is us. At that point it's fairly obvious that the film is no longer having the characters talk to each but to us instead.Now I'm not saying that children's movies have to have the same complex characters of 'Prisoners' but this film doesn't even try. It will say one thing but not give us any indication of who that person actually is through their actions. It makes some of the motives in the film very unclear. It's a shame that the film couldn't simply write consistent story and characters because this film could've been one of the best. It's animation, voice cast, and original ideas are enough to get one through but don't expect much more than that.",7,0,2,7 May 2016
10 Cloverfield Lane," Eh
","'10 Cloverfield Lane' is the unofficial sequel to the 2008 film 'Cloverfield'. This time however, we are treated to nice steady cinematography instead of the shaky 'found footage' from the original. This is probably because the film is trapped underground. Away from any carnage or mayhem that may or may not be occurring on the surface. This isn't the monster movie that the original was, no, this is supposed to be a psychological thriller. I say 'supposed to be' because it never really got to me in any meaningful ways. It stays fairly confined and small in scale, which isn't a bad thing. It just forces you to make this a character driven film instead of being story driven. And that is why '10 Colverfield Lane' abounds in mediocrity. Aside from John Goodman, who delivers an outstanding performance as the disturbed Howard, there isn't much to like. This is made worse when the only other characters in the film are so flat and uninspired. Mary Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. deliver solid performances but the characters they portray are less than solid. Gallagher plays a country boy, so he's kind of an idiot and Winstead plays a girl so she's kind of irrational. That's about it. It literally takes the stereotypes of these people and makes that their only real, discernible trait. Beyond this, it's nearly impossible to come up with any other traits that defined these characters as human beings.They where essentially plot devices in the John Goodman gun show. (Who really does offer an excellent performance) His character, Howard, is the only interesting part of this film. He is manipulative, conniving, eerie, and incredibly unsettling. His presence anchors this film in a rather convoluted reality.A reality that makes less and less sense the more the film plugs along. While I will say that the film did a great job of clouding the truth that lay just outside this under ground bunker, it doesn't amount to much. There are multiple plot lines that take effect here and not one is seen through to the end.Once we finally emerge from the metal deathtrap the film really nose dives. There is so much tension built by this point that even a mediocre conclusion would have been satisfactory. But it's not even that good. The best word I can use to describe it without spoiling anything is sloppy. It was so slapped together that basic continuity is thrown out the window just so they could hurry and wrap things up.While everything else is generally meh, there is one other thing that was truly awful, the sound design. I get that this is a thriller, and a thriller without jump scares just wouldn't appeal to modern audiences but did every single sound have to be ear splitting in volume? Any thump or crash is so deafeningly loud that it actually detracts from the scene. The film is trying to jump scare us so hard that it over exaggerates every single noise we hear. By the end I was so tired of this that legitimate scares didn't get to me. I sat starring blankly at the screen waiting for it roll credits. Again, not everything is bad though. If you have any desire to see this film you will most likely leave genuinely impressed by Goodman. The film pitches him the most complex character and he knocks it out of the park. But when nearly everything else is so uninspired it makes '10 Cloverfield Lane' seriously difficult to sit through.",5,3,8,17 March 2016
War Dogs," A dull movie with no new ideas
","Miles Teller and Jonah Hill in a movie about international gun runners? Sign me up! Is what I was saying going into the film. Coming out was a different story. As is the story with many movies so far this year, 'War Dogs' is a boring mess of a movie. If you saw 'The infiltrator' or read my review you know I hated that film. And for the same reasons I hate that film, I hate this one. Except this one has the nerve to be nearly identical to the far superior 'Wolf Of Wall Street'. This movie hits all the same beats and story lines that Scorseses near masterpiece does. The difference between the two is that this one is neither funny nor entertaining to watch. It is quite possibly one of the most dull, lifeless, boring films I have seen this year. Every time something funny or stressful could have happened it just cuts to another scene. Or, even more upsetting, ques up a voice over track from Teller. It blatantly skips over possible character building scenes in favor of out of place, lazy voice overs.I don't think I would be lying when I say that there is more voice overs here than in 'Knight of Cups'. Which literally had not script. Why the choice was made to do this really comes down to laziness. There is no other reason to explain why it couldn't just let scenes play out. Not only was there countless voice overs that robbed scenes of tension, but it also did chapter kind of things.Every twenty minutes or so a black screen with a sentence appeared on screen, describing what we were about to see. Just like the voice work, it didn't seem to have a point to it. It just felt like it didn't know how to transfer to the next scene so it threw in these random titles. They came from no where and served literally no purpose other than to tell you what was going to happen before it did.But what was I expecting? Right from the first few scenes this film has jarring tones that clash with each other from scene to scene. The first shot of the movie is a tense scene involving a kidnapping and it cuts immediately to a stylized, scene with a pop song playing over top. It is a completely jarring tonal shift that is off and on through out the film. And, much like 'Suicide Squad' it has no idea how to place a song in a scene.The songs it chooses are good on their own but, the scenes they are used in makes me hate them. All but maybe once were they used appropriately. It's sad that films have decided to just throw in pop songs to try and get a bigger audience instead of making a score that works in the film. It never helps the story move forward, they are all just kind of there.That being said, nothing could have saved this story. As I said, it's exactly like 'Wolf of Wall Street'. But it's not near as fun nor does it have the interesting character study that 'Wall Street' has. It has Jonah Hill and Miles Teller furiously trying to make the dialogue they have sound organic. Yet, it's so poorly written that these Oscar worthy actors come across with little chemistry and sound like morons while doing it.There isn't much that redeems this film. It's mostly well shot and these two performances aren't to bad. Other than that everything fails. It's poorly written, horribly boring, offers no interesting characters, and fails to deliver any comedic moments. It's one of those movies that thinks it's so much better than it is. It wants to be great and desperately tries to be but falls flat on its face.",3,26,50,20 August 2016
Detroit," An hour too long.
","'Detroit' is the latest from award-winning director Kathryn Bigelow. As the poster indicates she's helmed such films as 'Hurt Locker' and 'Zero Dark Thirty'. Which are pretty solid war flicks. So, naturally, this film had my interest. An Oscar-winning director taking on a film about the Detroit riots in the 60's? Count me in. However, this film is her sloppiest effort yet. If I was to go into this film unaware of who was behind the camera I would be shocked to learn that she has an Oscar to her name. This mainly stems from the structure and characters of the film. Because there really isn't any. But before I go to into that, I should say right off the bat that this is not about the Detroit riots.This is an isolated event that happened during the riots. Which is the most frustrating part of this movie. There is a solid, sharp, tension filled 90-minute film in this 150-minute exercise. This should have just been about the Algiers Hotel and what happened in it. Get rid of all the Detroit riot stuff, get rid of the fake character development, and focus on this hotel incident. Instead, it shoves in a near pointless opening act and a completely useless closing act. It opens showing the riots are in full swing. People are throwing cocktails, looting buildings, and setting fire to anything they can get their hands on. It conveys this with a bizarre back and forth cutting between the film and real footage. What's the point of that? If you're going to make a film, make a film. If you're going to make a documentary make a documentary. Cutting back and forth between real footage and 'dramatized' action just makes for an incredibly confusing start to a film that is ultimately not even about this. So why include it at all? This is the very definition of filler and it's completely baffling. However, the confusion comes to a head in the films final act. There are roughly thirty minutes of character arcs that literally don't serve any purpose to the film. What's the point of learning that one of the black guys turned as racist as the cops that beat him? Why should we care about these characters that are hardly fleshed out? What's the literal point of pretending that anyone actually cares about these flat, boring plot devices? If this film opened and closed with the events that happen in the Algier Hotel you don't even need to try and give the characters arcs.Instead of giving this jumbled, sporadic view of the events focus on one character. Make John Boyega the main character and only show us what he see's. It's literally that easy to fix. Cut out all the unnecessary fat. Instead of making this about five people make it about one. If you do, the event suddenly feels more personal and tense. If all you know is what the main character does then there would be palpable tension because you wouldn't know who to trust either.Aside from these complaints, I can say that this film isn't bad. The 90 minutes in the Algier hotel are all great. The camera work, costumes, and acting is all pretty much great in this situation. If I were to simply judge the film based on this portion I would be coming across far more positive, but since there's another hour to this film I can't help but feel underwhelmed. The film isn't what it promises to be and has in an unnecessary amount of filler that makes a lot this film boring or uneven. It's not a film that I can call bad but I still don't like it.",5,1,7,19 August 2017
John Wick," Glad to have you back Keanu.
","John Wick follows Keanu Reeves a retired hit man who's wife pasted away. He receives a dog as a final gift from her. On his second day with the dog he encounters thugs who want his car. He tells them no and wakes up later that night only to be beaten senseless, his dog killed and his car stolen. And he wants revenge.Everyone knows that Keanu Reeves doesn't have the best acting range. But when a roll is prefect for him he shines. And this is exactly what happens in John Wick. The film tiptoes the fine line between being ridiculous and over the top. As much killing as Keanu does is basically to get revenge for his dog. Which is borderline stupid but Reeves really sells it. Totally investing in his character and motives. Another notable actor here is William Defoe. While I thought his character was underused he wasn't underwritten and that was a nice little thing.The world that this film creates is intriguing and brutal. As reeves travels through the criminal underworld various phrases and items are used that are totally foreign even though this is set in New York City. Characters presumably know what they mean and don't bother explaining them to you. This is for the best. Being in the dark on the little things that make the world what it is, is gripping. It makes the world feel like it's been inhabited for a long time and that sets the film apart from the majority of action flicks. As lush as the world is, shoddy camera work struggles at bringing it to life on screen. The focus seemed to be forgotten in a large number of shots. Some shots don't even seem to be focused. The action scenes look great and are void of the annoying blur but in between these tense action sequences the camera work seems amateur at best. Maybe it was just the Theater I was In I don't know. Another problem for the movie was it's ending. Well I'd go as far as to say the entire 3rd act. *SPOILERS* Not much of a spoiler as we all knew Reeves would have his revenge. But after he takes his vengeance the movie limps on for at least another half hour. Attempting to tie up loose ends was a bad call here. It feels like the film climax and then says oh crap we forgot about him! And tries to deal with that and it goes through this 3 or 4 times. This is silly to say with an hour forty minute run time but the last half hour just feel unnecessary and overlong.Overall John Wick delivers on super cool action, a surprising level of emotional, and a world that feels real. John wick is a fine piece of cinema.",7,10,25,4 November 2014
Fury," World War 2 Brad Pitt movie
","Fury is a brutal take on a tank unit called fury. We join the crew just after one of their crew members had been killed. And just a few hours later a new recruit Norman, is sent to fill the position. Set near the end of world war 2 fury jumps right into things. It assumes the audience is paying attention and doesn't really ever stop to let you catch your breath. Now when you think of a world war 2 film starring brad pitt you probably think inglorious Bastards. And even after watching this film that won't change. Which is sad really, Because Brad was great as the unapologetic leader of fury. The entire cast great as well. I was really happy to see Shia Labeuf back at it and turned in a career best performance. But the focal point of the film is definitely Brad Pitt and Percy Jackson star Logan Lerman. Logan as Norman, is a young man that has never seen any action but by the end of the film he is just as hardened as the rest of his crew members. Jon Bernthal Is also a surprise getting some great development as the bully of Fury. But Shia and Micheal pena just don't have the development they should've had. This is really disappointing because they have moments near the end of the film were we should've cared about them and just didn't.Speaking of the end, I'm not going to spoil anything but the concluding action sequence is one of the best that movies have to offer. It is utterly intense and beautifully shot. These were really the only things that were consistently great here. The cinematography and action. Great sound design also boasts the action scenes to a new level. Listening to tank shells whistle by narrowly missing someone is a real treat. The brutality of the action was another great factor. Watching people being blown in half is not only gruesome but oddly satisfying. And it left craving the next tank fight only to be handed overly long scenes of talking that didn't help the film in anyway. Granted this is only a problem nearer to the end of the film but it's still hard to overlook. During an especially long break from action I actually started to think of how this review would go. That's how uneventful these scenes were. There was no character development and mostly nothing happened in most of these scenes. Overall Fury is well acted, beautifully shot, and offers impressive action sequences. Although Shia LaBeouf and Micheal Penas characters are depressingly underwritten and some of the breaks between action scenes are completely useless.",8,2,6,4 November 2014
Train to Busan," Starts strong only to turn into a typical Hollywood blockbuster.
","Zombie movies aren't quite dead yet. Over the past several years zombies have snuck their way into pop culture, overtaking almost every form of entertainment and putting themselves in the for front as the most beloved 'monster'. There's zombie survival guides, magazines, TV shows, and, of course, movies. 'Train to Busan' is one of those movies. But, as of late, zombies are seeming to wane in popularity. It would seem that the zombie's novelty has started to wear down due to its incredible over-saturation. That being said, when they are done right they remain a rather fun gimmick. Unfortunately, this film is really nothing more than that.It's a fun gimmicky movie that doesn't do too much else. But while it lasts, it's a blast. The film almost immediately gets started showing the slow beginnings of the outbreak. A couple burning buildings, some emergency vehicles darting around, and the occasional convulsing person. This type of first act isn't new or different by any means but it's the fact that we get into the action within ten minutes that makes this movie instantly enjoyable.Despite the dumb family dynamic that the film introduces the opening forty-ish minutes is probably the most visceral action in a movie so far this year. This is largely thanks to the actual filmmaking. The camera-work is all extremely fluid and interesting. There is rarely a moment when I saw a shot and thought it looked bad. The director uses the camera to help build tension instead of just throwing in loud sounds and music.It also helps when the makeup effects and performances are as well done as they are. Obviously, there is a fair amount of blood in this here movie and it's used sparring enough to help heighten a scene, instead just being the scene. And the actors that get the nice close ups as the zombies all do a wonderful job selling it. There are multiple wonderful moments when the zombies fling themselves down thrashing wildly.The best moment is definitely when an army man throws himself off the train and breaks his arm. It just dangles behind his head as he gets up and takes off running. It's these wonderful little touches that make this film enjoyable over a 'World War Z' type of movie. But not everything works in this movie. The script is particularly messy. This feels far closer to a big budget Hollywood movie, except without the budget.The most noticeable bad aspect of the film is the visual effects. Even though the majority of the film takes place on the actual train, there are plenty of times when we move off of said train and the run down world comes into focus. What we get are mostly unconvincing effects that hinder more than help. Fortunately, they are used sparring enough to not be a huge issue.But, like I said earlier, this film's script is specifically poor. This mainly stems from the emotional manipulation that it has. It tries to offer characters that you like but it doesn't develop on them. They are people that have families and the film expects you to just like them for no reason. And since you are supposed to like them for no reason it tries hard to have tear jerking moments.Every time it does, they are horribly predictable and nothing more than manipulative. It pauses the film to have the sappy music and the zoom ins as the characters pretend have emotional moments. Every time this happened, and it does far to often, I just wanted to punch the movie in face and yell, 'GET ON WITH IT!' If you want to have these moments in your movie, that's fine, but you need to have well- written characters. Or just go non-stop balls to the wall action.And that's where this movie fails. It tries desperately hard to be both action packed and emotional. When you try this hard to strike a balance, one aspect or another will suffer at any given time. Every time the film slows down to have characters talk, I just wanted to die. It affects the pacing in the worst way possible by making this a boring yet fun movie. It's definitely enjoyable to watch and it has a lot of great elements. If you like zombie movies or action oriented movies, you'll probably like this one, but for anyone else watch 'Dawn of the Dead' again.",6,9,23,9 December 2016
Green Room," It's effective but often overly repetitive.
","Every heard of 'The Thing' or '12 Angry Men'? Or any movie that this based mostly inside of a very confined space? Well add 'Green Room' to that short list. The film is about a heavy metal band that is on tour trying to promote their image. Right away these people aren't really that likable. They are seen siphoning gas within the first ten minutes and immediately I was angry at these people. As we follow these characters along, they travel to play at a rather underground bar. After their set they find that one of the other bands members before them was murdered in cold blood. As a means of protecting themselves the bars staff traps the witnesses in a room.Obviously things go south and a lot of people die. This movie reminded me of 'The Raid' as I watched it. Not because there is kung fu in it or anything, but because you really have no clue who is going to live or die. Putting everyone on the chopping block really lets you experience this movie as best as you can.It created very real tension that carried through out the entire film. To make it even more believable, the action is incredibly gritty. Machetes get involved, guns, box cutters, fire extinguishers, the whole deal. If something could be used as a weapon it was. This really grounded the movie in reality despite is surreal premise.It also helped that many of the actors are fairly unknown. Of course there's the girl from 'Arrested Development' and a couple guys from 'Star Trek' but other than that, it was mainly people I didn't recognize. I know this is a weird thing to bring up but it helped me further believe that this could happen to people without anyone's knowledge.However, the movie has a hard time getting all this going. The first half in general has a really hard time getting going. Hardly anything happens during that initial forty five minutes and there really isn't any characters to get invested in. So when a bunch of people you don't know much about do nothing for an hour, it can really test ones patience. In that first half there wasn't hardly anything that was impressive. You might call it build up to the bloody finale but I call it boring nothing. If that initial forty five minutes was cut in half there wouldn't be any problem. Whats even more disappointing was even in the best moments this movie had failures. Even when the blood is coating the walls, things got a bit tedious.Mainly because it gets so repetitive. They charge out of their room, people die, and they retreat back. This happens over and over again until the film ends. Of course the tension and grittiness carries us through these scenes but when things get that repetitive than it becomes more and more easy to notice other shortcomings.So far this movie is on the better end of horror movies for 2016. It's real, raw, and incredibly tense. Throw in a couple great performances and what you should've had is a great movie. But due to an overlong and dull opening half plus a repetitive second half things can get rather stale. If you're a horror fan, this movie will be a lot of fun to watch. If not than don't bother with 'Green Room'.",6,1,4,6 July 2016
The Babadook," Original and Intensely Unsettling
","The Babadook is an indie film out of Australia so it's understandable if you haven't heard of this one. Essie Davis plays Amelia. The mother of a very troubled child. Sam. We join the family 7 years after her husband died in a car accident. And it's very clear early on that the relationship between mother and son is not very strong at all. Watching as she curls up on the opposite side of the bed after her son has a nightmare is heartbreaking. But all this is made possible thanks to a powerhouse performance from Essie Davis. The other actors around her have spotty performances but Davis delivers an Awe inspiring one. She displays the characters grief and pain beautifully. Without her even speaking it's apparent what she has gone through and is going through. But the meat of the story is served up about 30 minutes in when Sam has his mother read a book about a monster called The Babadook. This is where the film gets intensely creepy and unsettling. It reminds me of the classic film Alien. Using atmosphere to it's advantage. I was terrified for nearly half the movie and You really only see the Babadook a spare few times. But listening helplessly as he whispers his name in a deep throaty voice is instantly nerve racking.Not only is the Babadook incredibly disturbing but Essie Davis is as well. I won't give anything up but man, he scared the pants off me near the end of the film. Even with all this going on movie has the balls to make you question everything that is happening. It truly is a superb and ambitious Psychological Horror. The only downside is the ending feels a bit unsatisfying. But hey, you can't get rid of the Babadook.Overall The Babadook is an emotionally heavy movie with some real depth to it. Not to mention a truly impressive and unnerving performance from Essie Davis. The Babadook could quite possibly be the best Horror movie of the year.",7,12,26,4 November 2014
Knives Out," Nice character mystery
","I like that this is less about whodunnit and more about WHOdunnit.
It's a predictable movie, but it seems almost designed that way. There's a lot of little twists and turns the film takes like a letter having invisible ink proving an affair or a character trying hopelessly to destroy evidence. While these things may be predictable or even plot devicey, it oddly didnt bother me much. I think that's because the movie has such an infectious personality. It's shot super well, the music is wonderful, and the cast has so much charisma. But the crowning achievement is the characters and the snappy dialogue they are given. All the characters have distinct personalities and motivations. Watching the characters interact is easily the most entertaining part. I really watching this surface level family slowly turn on themselves revealing how horrible they really are. They are all nice, but not really. They are all self made, but not really. The only truly good person is our main character and it's satisfying to watch her traverse this families mine field. You may not like the slightly lofty approach it takes but it works way better here then in Star Wars.",8,9,25,29 November 2019
Creed," Familiar but fresh.
","Creed is the latest film in the 'Rocky' film franchise. This marks the seventh installment so far. But unlike the other films 'Creed' is not about Balboa. It is instead about Apollo Creeds son, Adonis. A smart, driven kid that wants to be like his father. A world class boxer. But he doesn't want to have to ride his fathers coat tails to be great. He wants to create his own legacy. As I watched this film an interesting parallel started to develop between this plot line and the film itself. 'Creed' is, in many ways, a lot like the 'Rocky' films but it doesn't ride on their success. It develops its own story and motives outside of the other films. And, like its main character, it achieves this. This is what is so compelling about this film. While it does follow a very familiar formula, it doesn't ever seem like it's checking things off a list. It is its own movie. This is in large part thanks to the outstanding direction from Ryan Coogler. A (now) sophomore director previously known for 'Fruitvale Station'.His knowledge of film is prominent. He understands that these types of films have been done to death. And if he is to make a successful film, it HAS to be different. So, he took a all to familiar plot and made it feel new with its fleshed out characters. Adonis isn't fighting his way off the streets or trying to make a miraculous comeback after a catastrophic failure. No, he a child of privilege that is tired of people treating him as such.The film also gives Stallones character, Rocky, a face lift. It shows him as an old man just going through the motions of being retired. But once he decides to train Adonis, that is when these characters really get interesting. There isn't many scenes of boxing in this film so the dialogue has to be good. Thankfully the film has both great characters and great dialogue.Which makes the slower pace not feel to slow. The conversations actually feel like they have meaning and aren't just trying to fill time. This is where the talented cast thrives. In these quiet, expression driven moments. While they may not be perfect, they are able to communicate what their character is feeling with a simple look or movement.There is a lot to like about this film. A lot that I haven't even talked about. Like the stunning cinematography, or the impressively choreographed boxing scenes. But I am limited, so lets talk about the few flaws that cropped up amidst all this. One that I already mentioned was the formulaic story line. If you have seen any sports movie then you most likely know exactly how this film is going to play out. Since I have, predicting what would happen next was fairly easy. This made the two hour run time feel a bit stretched. Especially since the film was still unveiling plot points in the third act.However, these are small errors in a film that, overall, exceeded my expectations. Cooglers tight script and direction really display his knowledge of film. This helps the film not just be another sports movie, but more. It is able to offer deep characters that, by the end of the film, you actually care about. And, as an added bonus, the fights in the film are awesome. 'Creed' is definitely worth your time.",8,2,6,29 November 2015
Spotlight," A better version of Concussion.
","'Spotlight' is based on a true story about some really terrible things that happened in Boston just over ten years ago. What we see is the process the reporters behind this story took to uncover this awful story. In many movies like this the film can't resist making its main characters heros and the people they are going against the epitome of evil. One movie that comes to mind that did this was 'Concussion'. It set up Doctor Omalu as a hero and the NFL as the most evil corporation on the face of the planet. Fortunately, 'Spotlight' is not one of these films. It's one that understands how far subtly can go. And how far honesty can and should go. This is what makes 'Spotlight' stand apart from virtually every film in this genre. It displays some serious restraint on the part of writer/director Tom McCarthy. He seems to have such intimate knowledge about both this case and how we, as humans, react to things of this nature. This allows this story to unfold in the most natural way possible. It lets the audience feel exactly what these people are feeling. Thats what I loved about this film. It lets this riveting story unfold in such a way that lets you basically relieve the story as if it was happening right now. Each new reveal that we get not only throws its characters and audience further on our heads.Which is exactly what the film wants. It wants to show how horrible people can be without hardly anyone knowing about it. What's scarier about this film is how some people do know about things like this but sweep it under the rug to avoid unwanted attention. In fact this film is exactly what 'Concussion' should have been. Both are about roughly the same issue except this film views it from a third party perspective. Which, again, allows the film to unfold in the very best way possible. Although I felt as though the film was a little too restrained at times. It wanted us to feel the heft of the situation and, for the most part, it does. Except, it holds back certain ideas that keep the film from thoroughly realizing its true potential. We don't learn a whole lot about our characters and that keeps us from really investing in this story. We see them uncovering and reacting to everything but they all react the same way. No one seems to have a unique view on anything. This is really the only thing that holds the film back from being the best film of the year. It doesn't quite let you fully get into things due to too much restraint on the characters part. But that doesn't stop the film from being an intensely scary look at corporations and religion. It's a beautifully realized film that is perfectly crafted and executed by both its cast and director.",8,4,8,27 December 2015
Concussion," A waste of potential.
","'Concussion' is one of those movies that you watch once and never even think about again. It's a film that seems to stand solely on the principle of getting Will Smith an Oscar nomination. Because virtually nothing else in the film even compares to his dedication. Even writer/director Peter Landesman seems to not care about this film as much as Smith does. It's one of those films that you would call 'Oscar Bait'. A movie that has next to no substance aside from an all star actor acting their tail off. The other 'Oscar Bait' film I saw this year was 'Black Mass'. It's unfortunate that this is becoming more and more popular these days. Each time I see one of these films I can't help but feel like we missed out on a superb story. A story that, in a talented directors hands, could be a legitimately good film. But I'm not saying that this film is terrible. It's not. It's more mediocre than anything. Of course the standout here is Will Smith. Again, he seems to be the only person on this entire project that actually cares. He does the very best with the material he has and what results is his best performance for some time. Aside from him, the film harbors a fairly interesting story. A story that should've been put to better use. The fact this film seems to only exist to help Smith snag one of those golden trophies makes this story feel neutered. The lack of dedication and vision makes this miraculous, real life story boring. It fails to bring attention to the dangers of concussions and simultaneously fails to communicate how great this man is. Instead of watching a war between one man and a giant corporation unfold we get endless, blank faced conversations. While we certainly see how much this man did the film fails to show what he had to go through.The film gets off to a hot start explaining how educated Omalu is and how he approaches his craft in an artistic way. We see him discover what repetitive head trauma can do to human beings and suddenly the film becomes an incomprehensible mess. What should've been the best parts of the film turn into mindless nonsense. It has such a hard time deciding what storyline to follow that it just follows them all.This derailing is only made worse by extremely distracting directorial mistakes. The editing in some dialogue scenes is so awkward it's hard not to get thrown from the movie and back into your seat. There are cuts in the middle of sentences so many times that I found my self in awe of how little effort was put into making the film flow. There is literally a scene where, I swear, the camera man feel asleep and they kept the shot in the movie. Will Smith leans forward while he is talking and the camera doesn't move with him. So, we watch his eyes and forehead while he continues to talk, half out of frame until the camera bumbles its way into the correct position.This is one of those movies that knows it doesn't really have to try. It knows that it is only being made as a vessel to propel someone to the award show stage. So, it doesn't try. It's uneven, forced, and poorly directed. The only person who seems to be fully invested is Will Smith. Who gives his best performance in quite some time. To bad it's in a movie that no one will remember within a week.",5,14,25,26 December 2015
The Hateful Eight," A masterful film.
","Quentin Tarantinos eighth film 'The Hateful Eight' is upon us. And after seeing the film all I have to say is, go see this movie. Like, as soon as possible and, if you can, in glorious 70mm. This allows you to see the film in an ultra wide format. Not many theaters will get this awesome format so if you have a theater near you playing this film in 70mm go see it. Even if you can't view it in this special format this film still should not be missed. It's a once in a lifetime type of movie. Just being able to go see a film this good in theaters is a treat. The one thing that many are writing this film off for is it's lengthy run time. Clocking in at nearly three hours. In my opinion this makes the film that much better. Somehow Tarantino has fashioned a story that is so involving you will want more by the time it ends. The crazy part is, this isn't a new way of storytelling by any means. It follows eight (or nine depending on who you count) people that all take refuge in a lodge in order to avoid a blizzard.From early on it becomes clear that no one really likes each other. Slowly, their hate for each other begins to come out in the worst ways possible. It's such a simple plot that it's a wonder how extraordinary it is. Just like his other films this is due to seriously impressive writing. The dialogue is razor sharp in each and every scene. And, as an added bonus, the characters are very fleshed out. Each one has a different voice on each situation that comes up and they react as they feel they should. The film never uses its characters as vessels to move the plot along. No, 'The Hateful Eight' evolves as our characters do. Each separate action comes with a reaction that feels completely natural for the film.This leads to some of the funniest scenes of any movie this year. It's pitch black humor stems from the loathing for one another. But this isn't all the film has to say either. In fact this film, unlike some of his others, has a very mature subplot. A subplot that isn't just relevant in the stories universe but our day and age as well. It talks a lot about race relations and prejudices. And although we may hate some people, it's in our human nature to band together against someone who is infinitely worse without a second thought. It's an interesting idea that I have witnessed first hand. You may dislike someone at work or something until someone worse comes along that both of you hate. Then, suddenly, you become friends with that person in order to expel the universally hated person. It's on these reasons that 'The Hateful Eight' thrives. It's a superb film anchored by an excellent cast playing excellent characters. Characters that you care very much about. Although it has a more mature plot it's still a whole mess of fun. It's bloody, hilarious, and pumping with energy. If there is a theater nearby playing this film, go see it.",9,3,21,26 December 2015
The Hateful Eight," Love it
","I love this movie and the extended version helped me love it even more. Great character writing, satisfying payoffs, great performances, and beautiful 70 mm camera work makes this really stand out for me. Its up there as one of my favourite Tarantino movies and making it into a mini series was a stroke of genius. The best way to watch it is still from start to finish straight through, but 4 hours is a daunting task to ask of anyone. Putting it into 4 episodes makes it feel a lot more manageable. Great idea for a great film, hopefully this helps bring more people around on this.",9,0,1,29 November 2019
Suicide Squad," Mindless nonsense
","DC is in a bit of a bad spot right now. After the colossal backlash to 'Batman V Superman' they decided to put all their eggs into one basket. That basket being 'Suicide Squad'. I'm gonna say it right now. If this movie represents the DC movies we are going to get in the next few years, they need to quit now. Because this film is quite honestly one of the worst comic book movies I have seen in the last decade. Now, I have something of a rep for hating on the Marvel films. But nothing they have made even comes close to the garbage fire that is this movie. But lets start at the beginning. The film opens with Viola Davis at a meeting with a couple of expendable government dude bros.She sits them down and tells them that she wants to gather a group of bad guys together as a silver bullet just in cause something really really bad happens. And what do ya know? Something really really bad happens. The rest of this movie. I'm not joking when I say that this is on the same level as last years 'Fant4stic'.There is so much wrong with this film that it physically hurt to sit through it. Unfortunately I didn't realize this earlier or I would have walked out of the theater. And I have never walked out of a movie in my life. But I should've seen it coming. Because right away, it's bad. The first twenty minutes of the film are filled with exposition dumps the likes of which I have never seen.Viola Davis's character literally sits at a table and tells a couple dudes the names, abilities, and backstories of almost all the villains featured in the movie. Twenty minutes of nothing. Twenty minutes of time wasted on something that can effortlessly be written into conversation through out the movie. And that's the biggest issue with this film. ‚Äã The writing is so incredibly awful. Not only can Ayer seemingly not write a convincing character but he can't even write a coherent story. This movie is all over the freaking place. First they get the bad guys together to stop some glowing Egyptian dudes but not really. They actually go into some rando building to do a thing that makes no sense. And along the way they get into slow mo fights between literal piles of trash.Then they have to go do something else and then something else. Completely ignoring the orbital drill plunging into the sky, which may as well have spelled doom in mid air. As they went about doing nothing the film attempts to give them some shred of personality by force feeding us through flash backs. At completely random times someone would just have some stupid flash back that was irrelevant to anything happening.It was moments like these that made the films re-shoots glaringly obvious. There are scenes that come out of no where and as soon as they finish the movie gets going again. Like a scene with Harley Quin fighting trash guys in an elevator. She fights these nothings and then an actual story scene happens. Or in the subway scene when army man gives creepy girl a bomb and she arms it and takes off. The army man said it had a 2 second timer but it doesn't go off. She arms it, leaves, the timer shows one, and the scene cuts away. Everyone is fine and it's never brought up again.This happens so much through out the film it's painful. They just have flash backs and fight scenes for no reason at all. And whenever one of these fights comes up it's impossible to tell what is going on. The direction and editing is so choppy that things and people seemingly appear out of no where and sometimes just disappear again. Without the excessive use of slow-mo these scenes would be nothing more than shapes and colors moving around on a screen.I have so many problems with this film that it's impossible to put them all into a short review like this. The only reason I don't give this film the lowest score I can possibly give is because the cast gives solid performances. That is it. Every other aspect of this movie is utter nonsense. The story is all over the place, the characters are flat as boards, it's horribly unfunny, the direction and cinematography is by the numbers, and every ounce of logic seems stripped away. Not to mention how bad the soundtrack is. It cuts from pop song to cookie cutter nonsense from scene to scene, not caring about what the context of the scene is. 'Suicide Squad' wastes it's talented cast and will waste two hours of your life if you bother to see it.",2,5,10,7 August 2016
Interstellar," 3rd act is the only bad in this movie.
","Interstellar is not Christopher Nolans best. But I got to say It's pretty close. It opens on Cooper played Matthew McConaughey a farmer with living with his 2 kids and his dad. We learn very quickly that the world is in a state of decay. And that the planet is running low on food. The not so distance future ideas purposed here are very interesting. But as interesting as it is the movie doesn't stay on earth for very long. After 30-40 minutes the movie journeys into the blackness of space. And this is were the fun really beings. You can feel Chris Nolans attention to detail as you awe at super massive black holes or reality bending wormholes. Interstellar is not just a movie, its an experience. One that you should have in theaters. The visuals are absolutely gorgeous. This is film really does push the limits of visual FX. Reportedly having to design completely new software to mathematically get all the visuals correct. Not only are the VFX incredible but the sound is too. In fact it was probably my favorite part of the whole movie. It goes from deathly silent to blaringly loud numerous times. And that helped to sell the experience even more. Oh and the soundtrack by Hans zimmer is just amazing. Apparently Chris didn't even give him a movie script. He just said get rid of the drums and give me something fresh. And a beautiful, haunting score was the result. With all this amazingness, Nolan doesn't forget his characters. Well he forgets a few. But he wastes no time having his characters tell a emotional story. While the characters are pretty good the acting is only meh. There wasn't any standout performances from anyone. But it was hard to focus in the early hours of the movie because the guy next to me was playing with a piece of paper for like an hour!! But i did get to hear the last half of the film and unfortunately it stumbled around with the 3rd act. Here's how I would describe it. This part was super cool. And this part was super cool. But they didn't really add up. That left me confused and wanting an explanation but not getting one. Everything was explained with science throughout the movie then suddenly it wasn't. Overall Interstellar is a film you HAVE to see in theaters. It is Breathtaking to look at and incredible to listen too. The story is equally grand but cracks under it's own weight in the 3rd act.",7,0,5,7 November 2014
Incendies," Beautifully haunting.
","'Incendies' is the film that put director Denis Villeneuve on the map. Now, with 'Prisoners', 'Enemy', and 'Sicario' under his belt Villeneuve has become one the more eye catching directors working today. Just like his other films 'Incendies' strings together a cobweb like story. We watch as a pair of twins venture out to the middle east in search of their father and brother, as a final wish of their recently departed mother. Although the film is more about these twins finding out who their mother was. Naturally this not all that the film is about but, to avoid heavy spoilers and to keep this film as the experience it should be, I will leave it at that.And this film is an experience. Even though the film runs at a fairly long two hour and twenty minute run time, what 'Incendies' accomplishes in that time is remarkable. It is able to draw you in and hold your attention for its entire run time. Its story is unlike anything you will ever see. It's a slow burning thriller that hits every beat that you'd expect and every beat that you don't expect. And it does it in such a way that everything feels completely natural and progressive. The control that Villeneuve has over the film is insane. Every single person involved in front and behind of the camera does a superb job. Villeneuve knows what he wants out of the film and gets exactly that.It's a beautiful film that is able to manipulate its audience with utter ease. Its not just a beautifully constructed film but a beautiful film to look at too. It may not be Roger Deakins who shot 'Prisoners' and 'Sicario' but 'Incendies' seems to take note of this gritty realistic look. And it employs this same style here. And just like his other films 'Incendies' has an ending that will knock you flat. This ending would not be near as effective if where in anyone else's hands. It cuts between flashbacks and reality in such a way that keeps the film from becoming predictable. So, when the film concludes it comes as a complete shock. I could go on and on about how miraculous this film is. But I think I should just leave it here. If you have any desire at all to see this film please go out and purchase it. If you do, I assure you that 'Incendies' is a film that you will never forget. It's a beautifully constructed film with enough style to keep just about any body interested.",10,3,6,14 December 2015
The Revenant," Breathtaking but repetitive.
","'The Revenant' is unlike any movie you will ever see. It is an absolutely breathtaking film about one of the most insane human feats ever. The film is all about a man by the name of Hugh Glass. A man that survives a bear attack. A man that then crawls and limps his way 200 miles after the man that slaughtered his son before his very eyes. Saying that this man is hardcore is an understatement. What he endears is a testament to how resilient the human spirit can be. So who better to play him than the legendary Leonardo DiCaprio. This could very well be the film that finally gets him that coveted golden statue at the Oscars this February. Aside from the insanity that is this story and Leos superb performance, this film has a lot to offer. Most noticeably is how the film itself looks. Shot in all natural light, 'The Revenant' is able to bring a sense of realism that few films have achieved. It's a beautiful film to behold that effortlessly sucks you into its world.Honestly, if I were to rate this film from a technical stand point it would most definitely receive a perfect rating. Everything done behind the camera is flawless. The standout being Inarritu himself. There are some scenes in this film with so many moving parts it's a wonder how he is able to control them all. We have fights between white men and Indians that flow so naturally that you can practically feel like you're there. Yet I found myself ultimately disappointing with this film. Perhaps this my fault. Coming straight off 'Birdman' I found the next film that Inarritu was making and kind of went crazy. I saw this films story line along with the director and all star cast and have been losing my mind waiting for it ever since. I held this film up like many people were doing with 'The Force Awakens'.That being said, as I watched I found some very obvious mistakes. The film never felt like it quite made it to a final draft. The problem with this film is that we don't learn one single thing about our main character. He is certainly the most determined human being of all time but what do we really learn about him? There seems to be nothing making him a man other than a convoluted back story with a side of vengeance. There is so few character traits that we can actually point to that make him human.This makes the lengthy two and a half hour run time drag at times. He tries to survive then runs from Indians over and over and over again. There is a point where this just isn't exciting any more. And it left me longing for some actual character moments from him. In fact the only characters we really get to know aren't in the film all that much. What's stranger is that, through the entire run time, a tribe of Indians is on his tail for absolutely no reason. Yeah they are looking for a stolen girl but why on earth are they following the company that they demolish at the beginning of the film? Obviously she isn't with them so why on earth didn't they investigate literally anyone else?The subplots in this film made so little sense that switching back to our relatively bland main character came as a breath of fresh air. The film never really felt like it was fully thought through. There was so many things that didn't add up that following the repetitive journey of DiCaprio became, at times, a strain. But somehow, it remains a good movie. It's gritty, hard to watch, but most of all an absolute spectacle and landmark in film making.",7,14,34,26 December 2015
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The original is better
","Watched the Extended Special Edition cut for the first time and definitely prefer the Theatrical over this. That said, this review is for the Extended Special Edition cut.
Unfortunately for T2 there is little in the way of story that's very fresh. It's essentially the same movie as the first movie. It hits the same beats in the same places and has incredibly similar action set pieces. There are some new things in here like them going and blowing up Skynet. There a few new places they visit but at the core of it, it's very similar. Plus, the humor and one liners go little bit too far. There's great moments with the Terminator learning human emotion like when he attempts to smile but, there's a bit much of it. Speaking of elements that are a bit much, the product placement is EXCESSIVE. The amount of Pepsi and Subway in this movie is insane. Drinking, eating, and turning products towards the camera are only the start of it. While I'm complaining I may as well address the bizarre structure choices. The first hour or so is the Terminator sequel we would expect. A Terminator trying to get a guy and a guy protecting that guy. Pretty simple stuff but then it shifts into being about the creation of Skynet. Where our characters confront the creator and blow up the cyberdine building. It almost completely abandons the T-1000, barely mentioning it and showing it even less. When the T-1000 forces its way back into the movie it feels like the Skynet creation movie ends and the Terminator sequel begins again. It's jarring and only works thanks to pretty good writing but it's still an odd choice to make.
But this movie still rules. The characters are far more interesting then they are in the first movie and the themes presented far outdo the original. Even though there are a lot of similar action sequences, they absolutely RIP in this movie. The camera work is far slicker and more fluent thanks to the big budget making each sequence more engaging. There's a great blend of old school effects (rear screen projection, puppeteering, matte paintings, stop motion) and new school effects. It's also one of the last big budget action movies I can think of that meldes a ton of genres together seemlessly. You got The Thing type body horror, big action set pieces, comedic moments, character drama, and of course sci-fi. The Terminator is cooler, the action hits harder, the characters are more dynamic, and the filmmaking is top notch. Still one of the coolest sequels to a classic movie ever.",7,0,1,16 March 2020
Dunkirk," Another Great Nolan Film.
","If there is one thing that Christopher Nolan does better than any other director working right now it's that he puts butts in seats. Every single movie he has made since 'Batman Begins' has featured people swarming in droves to their nearest theater. I would wager that 90% of people that go see this film will not know anything about the subject matter. Which is sort of what makes him so interesting. He is making gigantic studio blockbusters of whatever he wants. Warner Bros smartly realized that this man packs theaters and makes money so they let him do whatever he feels like doing. Which is a little weird considering Warner Bros DC cinematic universe right now... Before I get too far into this movie I want to point out the few negatives I have with it. Keep in mind that these things will more than likely not bother anyone else. I also realize that these are nitpicking but regardless, they still took me out of the experience. And I would call this an experience, which is all the more reason that these nitpicks bother me. When something happens in an experience to take you out of it I think it's fair to point at that to say that it ruined a bit of the experience.And the thing that ruined the most parts of this film was the audio recordings. No, not the sound effects but the microphones that recorded the actor's dialogue. Almost every single time an actor talked there was an audible buzzing sound that would fade in and out each time a character opened their mouth. I'm pretty happy that most of the film didn't need dialogue because this bugged literally every time it happened.The only other blemish on the film's armor comes due to the color correcting and nonlinear nature of the story. There was a number of scenes where every single cut was a different color temperature. We would see a vibrant blue sky with a bomber flying and the next cut would be a boat that looked gray or orange. Or one cut would be during daytime and the next would be dark. Again, these are small issues but in an experience such as this, they stand out far more than they would in a 'Dark Knight' sort of film.However, this is easily the best war movie 2017 has to offer. Which is saying a lot considering the vast surplus of war melodramas from this year. Much like Nolans other movies 'Dunkirk' is a sensory masterpiece. Every shot in the film is near perfect. The composition of each frame and the camera movement is so precise for each individual scene. Not only that but the sound editing is absolutely spectacular. The film is abrasively loud and in your face. From the very first scene the film barrages you with ear piercing sounds that put you right in the middle of this war. Planes rumble overhead, bullet whiz by, and people yell at each other and it's all captured perfectly. In all honesty, if I were to judge this film based on its technical achievements this would receive top marks, especially when costumes, sets, and makeup is factored in.Because every single thing in this film is so believable that it often transcends being a film and almost feels like a documentary. Nolan's craft has never been better and he deserves endless praise because he directors the crap out of this movie. But Nolan is not only the director here, he is also the writer. Which brings me to the most intriguing aspect of the movie. The structure and story that we get aren't like your everyday war movie.Sure the story is very simple but it tells it from three different perspectives. Doing this allowed him to cut between the sea, land, and air which brings different dimensions to this battle. We see how each one affects and is affected by each other. This also allows Nolan to cut away from one thing to another the moment it gets dull. He doesn't have to restrict himself to making the air plane scenes interesting all on their own. Instead he just cuts to something interesting when the dog fight is over.Doing this keeps the pace of the film absolutely relentless. For ninety minutes you are barraged endlessly by this fight. While it may not always work the strengths far outweigh the flaws. The costumes, sets, acting, direction, cinematography, action, and the visual nature of the film all come together to create something that feels so different than everything else out right now. Sure, it may not be your typical summer blockbuster and I'm not sure I could ever watch it again but it's certainly worth keeping out.",8,5,11,23 July 2017
The Exorcist," A victim of its own reputation
","There are only so many movies out there whose reputation towers over it. The Exorcist may be at the top of that short list. It looms over everyone that goes to watch. Everyone has heard of 'the scariest movie ever made'. Churches have told members to avoid this on the grounds of it being evil. Everyone knoes about the Exorcist, which is why it's so difficult to go into this with clean eyes. Try as I might to avoid hearing about this film, it was inevitable to hear or see some spoilers. The walking down the stairs backwards scene, the crucifix scene, and the priest jumping out the window are nearly impossible to avoid. Since this is such a victim of it's reputation, people not only want to prove it's worth but as many people want to discredit it. Like it or not this movie has stuck around and I think it's here to stay. One thing to mention out of the gate is the time period it was made in. The movie was released in 1973 so if you expect this to resemble modern horror, you're going to be disappointed. It's almost 50 years old now. That comes with some amount of date. Some of the effects aren't the best and the pacing is different then something more modern. Which are really my only issues here, despite me just not really getting into it. It's a bit dated now and at times feels tedious. Which is odd considering that the presentation here is quite stark and abrupt. The editing is quite harsh and there's a lot of hard cuts from one thing to the next. It feels like it doesn't have any time to waste and the progression of time is quick. It's quite the bizarre pacing/editing experience to say the least. I like the idea of the film showing the long painful process of getting the exorcism. The mother goes to the hospital, shrinks, and finally she turns to religion as a last ditch effort to save her daughter. On paper, I love that idea. In practice I think there is to much time spent on other things for it to work completely. Even though I didn't really get sucked into it, there are many moments that I loved. The entire sequence where Regan is getting examined by doctors is legitimately unsettling. I also loved almost everything to do with Father Karras. I liked his trials of faith, the scene when he visits his mother, and every time he talks with Regan. His arc from a man on the brink of leaving the church to coming face to face with pure evil and overcoming it is great. He's by far the most compelling and well rounded character here. The mother character being pushed to her wits end is nice but I didn't much care for the performance. Overall, it's still a really good movie. There's lots of great ideas at play, unsettling sequences, and great character work. It doesn't all come together completely but I think it's still rather effective.",7,0,0,8 May 2020
Captain America: Civil War," Best from Marvel since Guardians
","The third addition to the 'Captain America' films is here. This time our favorite hero's are pitted against each other after disagreeing when the government tries to limit their free rein. Needless to say, tensions get high and a fight between them breaks out. Or that's at least what we were pitched through the trailers. This is not what happens in the film. Surprisingly enough, It is very similar to 'Dawn of Justice'. This film offers far better editing and the stakes feel higher but that seems to be the only major differences. That was actually pretty disappointing to see. You all know my stance on 'Dawn of Justice' so I won't go into it.But seeing these two very similar movies come out pretty close together made this one kinda boring. The entire time I couldn't help thinking I had seen a version of this already. That being said, this film is not much better than 'Dawn of Justice'. My biggest gripes are unfortunately directed right at the films biggest selling point.The fact that these hero's are fighting each other. I liked the idea that there was repercussions to the mindless violence of the previous films. It made for an interesting bit of conflict early on in the movie. But it was handled very poorly. Surprisingly enough this was in direct correlation with the characters motives. Which were incredibly stupid. Caps motives are simple, I'm not taking sides with the government because they are to restrictive. Iron Mans are not so simple. At first his arguments make sense. Regardless of the people we saved there are still thousands lost. And we have to be accountable for that.But what spurred this disagreement? The film opens with a fight taking place between Cap with some others and a couple of bad guys. One guy tries blowing himself up to kill Cap but Witch lady contains the blast and throws him into the air. Right into the only building around them. It kills some people and other people get upset.So you mean to tell me that this entire film could've been avoided if she, I don't know, threw him into the open space directly above her? Or just smashed him down into the ground? Right away the entire film feels delegitimized. They seriously could not have come up with a better excuse than, Oh a lot of people died because that witch lady can't aim worth crap?Or the fact that the only reason Iron Man wants to side with the government is because some random lady got mad at him. Like, he walked out of a presentation and a random lady was just standing there starring at the wall. Was her whole plan to just stand there and wait for him so she could shove her son all over him? What if he went off a different way? What if he didn't care at all? Would this entire film not have happen if he just didn't care?With in thirty minutes the only two characters that matter are given the stupidest motives ever. What about Black Panthers motives? Why didn't the blast that killed his father also kill him? He looked actually closer to it than his dad. Oh I get it, someone had to be mad at the Winter Soldier for this film to work in the slightest. All of this is at the very beginning of the film. By the end there was a mind boggling amount of plot holes and pretend risks being taking. √¢‚Ç¨‚Äπ So much so that I could spend hours talking about them, but I won't. Why? Because this film isn't that bad. All the performances were pretty great. As were the fight sequences. Especially the climatic fight scene. I won't go into why it made no sense but, logic aside, it was the only part of the film that was actually involving.The film does a lot right. The action is gritty, the music is great, and the acting is pretty great across the board. But it's difficult to ignore the holes all over the script. It's plagued with lapses in logic, character motives, and it lacks the great story and villain it tries desperately hard to have. In the end this is worth seeing if only to watch your favorite characters throw down. Even if you'll have to wade through a lot of poor writing to get there.",6,3,7,7 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Embarrassing cash grab
","It finally happened, 'Harry Potter' has become a superhero movie. Wanna watch a movie that destroys basically everything you loved about the original eight films? Then, boy, do I have a movie for you. Do you want fun and magic? To bad, you get a dwarf stripper that sings with clouds of smoke and terribly animated 'fantastic beasts'. Remember the charismatic lead trio from HP? You liked them right? Well here's another trio but now none of them are compelling and are constantly used as comedic relief. Do you like stories that go places with things that happen? Well sucks to be you, sit back and watch generic cardboard characters do nothing for nearly two and a half hours.But in all seriousness, this film is like watching a train wreck of everything you loved in slow motion...that goes on for three hours. This is not only the worst 'Harry Potter' movie to date but it's one of the most disappointing films of the year. Nearly everything about this film was bad. Not everything, but everything that makes a movie interesting. If you like to see good performances and some neat direction then you might get some kicks out of this.Because it felt like everyone tried. They tried their best, but performances and camera work can not save an awful script. And this script is truly atrocious. For starters, the dialogue is just the worst thing. When you have your characters say anything and everything on their minds things become very stale. There's never any tension between characters because they just say exactly how they are feeling.But I am already giving this movie to much credit by saying that there are characters here. There aren't. There's a red head guy, a girl, and a fat Kevin James type. This makes up our 'main characters'. If you asked me to name specific traits that these 'characters' had, I wouldn't be able to tell you. They only do things and say things because the script demands that it happens.There's just no personality with this film. It feels just like a modern summer blockbuster, churned out to make a huge profit. And boy does this feel churned out. The entire film feels like a first draft that wasn't allowed to be fixed. Aside from the script, the visual effects suffer most from this. They look like that were finished last week. Normally I wouldn't complain too much with VFX but when your film has nearly $200 million dollars in its budget you'd expect it to at least look as good as the Lord of the Rings movies.But the worst part of this film hands down is the story. Why? Because there isn't one. Three people wander around doing goofy things with goofy dinosaurs and then New York blows up. There wasn't any flow to the film. It felt like scene after scene of neat things that didn't really connect with anything. Things just sort of happen and then they go away without affecting the plot in any way whatsoever.Now, if the characters were actually fleshed out then this wouldn't have been such a big problem. But since they are cardboard this meandering nature of the story is just unbearable to sit through. If your characters aren't interesting then you NEED a story, but this film just has things. Things that happen and things that go boom and things that are designed to get laughs. For nearly two hours this is the 'story' we get, things and bad jokes. Like elementary level jokes. Which may actually be the target audience for this film? There's a lot of bright things and people fall down and go boom which is horribly bland to watch for me, but I'd bet a child would get immense entertainment from this film. That's not to say only a child can like it, though. From my packed theater experience, a lot of not child really liked this film. And I can understand why, to an extent.This film is designed to pander to die hard HP fans and kids, so that these young ones can be nostalgic about this film in ten years. But for me personally, this was an unbearable watch. Aside from performances and some neat camera work this film is horrendous. I don't even think I can classify it as a film. It's a movie that offers nothing below the surface and next to nothing on the surface. It's purely a popcorn film that is meant to do nothing but entertain. But I wasn't entertained.",3,5,9,9 December 2016
The Conjuring 2," It overcomes its poor plot with new, effective scares.
","As I walked out of my showing of 'The Conjuring 2' I overheard a family talking amongst themselves. The youngest boy said that the film itself wasn't what scarred him but the noises did. This made me think a lot about what many people deem as horror. It's strange that, to many people, fear is not measured by how it makes them feel but by how far their butts left their seat. For me this is not effective horror. When I see a horror film I want to be affected by it. I want to feel that sense of dread that churns deep in your stomach and makes you sweat through your clothes. Unlike many people that saw this film with me, I thought this film did just that.It's sad that people are writing off this films effectiveness based on the fact that there weren't many jump scares. I mean, there were obviously some in there but the majority of the film is atmosphere. The atmosphere that this film builds really gives off a sinister vibe. As I watched, an eerie feeling washed over me. The sense that this is not something we are suppose to be watching.And this feeling continued for the films two hour run time. The more sinister the plot gets the more you just feel a sense of helplessness. This sense of dread helped the film be more than just any other horror movie. With this feeling surrounding the film the scares hit hard. It knows that jump scares are far better than false scares and it uses it's atmosphere to really make you lose it.If anything jumps you in the film it is the ghost or something the ghost does. It's never like a bird flying around or a person grabbing someones shoulder. Instead the film actually uses the ghost to scare you. What I loved about this movie is how many new, different scares where in it. It's clear that James Wan was having a blast making this movie and he experimented with a lot of new things.Some fall flat but most are extremely cool and effective. Not only was he experimenting with new scares but new camera movements as well. Which all turned out super impressive. There's a great birds eye view shot of people running down a alley that made my jaw drop. That's what separates this film from so many others. The cast and crew seemed like they were having way to much fun with it. It gave the film energy that many don't have. This helped 'The Conjuring 2' elevate itself over a relatively bland story. A story that we have all seen a million times over. Where someone gets haunted, the family gets involved, than things get really bad so they call experts in to cleanse the house.The fact that this isn't anything new or different really does hurt the film. It makes a lot of the scares predictable and the plot points less sharp. Not only that but when your movie runs for more than two hours with a story like this it can get a bit dry near the end. Especially when the previous hour and a half was a none stop scare fest.It's at that point where I began to realize that not a single character had any personality what so ever. All anyone was, was a plot device for the script. A means of forwarding the story to the next scene. They would do something that a normal human probably wouldn't do, get freaked out and than it was on to the next scene.While 'The Conjuring 2' may not be as good as the first film it is still a solid horror flick. It knows what it is and doesn't bother with the extraneous 'character building' that many others do during the opening half hour. While it certainly would've made the film better to have characters we cared about, not pretending like they were doing this helped get to what we paid for. Getting the pants scared off of us. And this film does that in a fresh, new, and very effective way. If you're a horror fan this one should not be missed. Just make sure to manage your expectations.",7,0,1,11 June 2016
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Not without problems
","How to train your dragon 2 is the second installment in this trilogy. Its now five years later and most of the main characters are young adults. It's definitely a bold move. But it pays off nicely. The animation software used to build this film is amazing. The environments, characters, and dragons all look premium. Trying to watch the first after seeing this almost is unbearable its that good. Even if the first film has amazing animation. Which it does. Hiccups dad now is realizing his time is up as chief of his viking tribe. He wants to train hiccup in becoming the chief. But being young and rebellious hiccup just flies off on his pet dragon. Finding new unmarked territories. The relationship between him and his dragon is better then ever. The solid bond is made even stronger in this film. While in a new territory hiccup stumbles across a masked figure who takes him to a dragon colony. Its his mom. Yeah! Turns out that his mom ran off years ago and is living with these dragons. She knows nearly everything and anything about them. Not unlike hiccup. A little while passes and we finally meet the villain of this flick. Drago Bloodfist. He is for sure the weakest part of this film. While we learn emotional deep things about most of the main characters we learn nothing about him. He is a pretty pathetic attempt at a villain. If they tried at all. Once we meet Bloodfist the plot also thins out. A very promising premise is thrown away to try and have the emotion carry it. It attempts to cover it up in almost any way you can think of. Death, loss of limb, etc. Its sad to see it give up on itself like it does. All in all How To Train Your Dragon 2 is great kids flick filled with emotion, superb animation, and brilliant deep characters. But it does suffer from a flat plot line and a 2nd dimensional villain.",6,1,4,4 November 2014
It Follows," Good but Over-hyped.
","Never has a film pushed abstinence more then 'It Follows'. I know this sounds weird. Even more so when it's a horror film we are talking about. While the film is memorable is countless other ways, this is what I personally got out of 'It Follows'. I am hard pressed to recall a horror film pushing a subject so hard. In every action it takes we are pushed more and more into thinking, 'Don't do the diddly, that will solve all your problems.' It's an interesting combination that doesn't always work. The mix of horror and preachyness is often times very odd. The only times it doesn't work is when we see 'IT'. The mysterious being that, simply, follows our lead character(s). More times than not 'IT' is a half (or fully) naked woman. This choice does stay in tune with it's major goal but often comes across more comical than horrifying. The times when one will push themselves against the back of their respective seat is countless. Yet, a number of these times were dampened by weird and sometimes unintentionally funny moments. This is a big issue for me regardless of how terrifying this film is. And it is terrifying. It will wiggle its way to your very center and stay there. There is quite a bit of down time between each tense scene however. But 'It Follows' isn't dumb enough to just plain give you a break. Even in scenes were nothing happens, fear lingers in the air. It places 'IT' in the back ground of shots multiple times. Moving ever so slowly towards its prey.The film cleverly dodges character development, especially with all its down time. It doesn't really give you a moment to think about it's characters. You are as set on getting rid of this horror as it's characters are. This works incredibly well for this film. It gives its characters just enough personality to care about them and feel intensely threatened by 'IT'. 'It Follows' soundtrack is also something I should mention. It has an 80's arcade feel surrounding it. It's odd yet it does a fantastic job of bringing the film to life without sounding like the stereotypical horror score. It's as exacting as the film it plays over top. Even if some of the plot decisions falter from time to time.",7,5,14,25 April 2015
Gone Girl," David Fincher proves he is a hard hitting Director once again.
","Gone Girl could be the best film so far this year but Viewer discretion is DEFIANTLY advised. The film follows Nick and Amy Dunn a newly wed couple settling into life in Missouri. But it that all changes when Amy goes missing. The entire country jumps on board to try and help find Amy. And slowly everyone starts turning on Nick. The Back nice guy that is pretty oblivious to everything around him. But if you think you have this movie figured out, think again. THE GOOD STUFF! It's directed by David Fincher. One of the most ambitious dark directors of the modern age. And he's done it again. The script is very tightly written. Movies based on books tend to either flop or are critically praised. But when you have the author of the book writing the Screenplay not much can go wrong. The Dark humor that is sprinkled in is perfect for the scenes that its used in and is often hilarious. The film has a mood surrounding it that is unlike any movie you will ever see. Through out you are at the edge of your seat yet also constantly looking behind you as a deeply unsettling feeling creeps over your body. This is in large part thanks to the performances by the leads. Ben Affleck and Rosamund pike are so terrific in there roles as well as just about everyone else. THE BAD STUFF... Well like I said there isn't to much that can go wrong when the books author is on board helping write. There is really only one thing that I didn't like in this film. Near the beginning there was a lot of nudity. Now don't get me wrong i'm OK with it as long as it helps to obtain what the film is going for. Which closer to the end its used perfectly. But the nudity at the beginning feels completely unnecessary and forced. And there wasn't much shortage of it either. The Verdict Gone Girl is without a doubt one of the best films of the year. Featuring outstanding acting, superb writing, and just an overall mood to it that is unlike anything in film. But some of the nudity took me out of the movie because of how forced it felt.",10,29,59,4 November 2014
Get Out," A creative if rather bland horror movie.
","Coming off of the amazingly bad comedy 'Keanu' Jordan Peele has decided to branch out into the horror genre. From various interviews that I saw with him, he seemed to bring this film out of a very genuine place. Saying that, while it has commentary about racism, it's not intended to be aggressive or hostile. It's just things that he has personally noticed. So he combined his own personal observations about race relations and his favorite genre of film, horror. The story is mainly about a black man that goes to visit his white girlfriend's parents (it's very weird typing it like this but, trust me this is vital information). Upon arrival, things aren't quite as they seem. Like the tagline suggests, 'Just because you're invited doesn't mean you're welcome.'Shortly after arriving the mom of his girlfriend puts him in a trance of sorts. She claims that this specific type of hypnosis is to aid him in breaking his smoking habit (a 'habit' that we never see). This hypnosis scene is probably the best scene in the entire film and I wish we got more stuff like it. The way it's intercut with things from his past and how it slowly ratchets up tension using sound is all very well done.That's the thing with this film, though. It's about 50% good 50% bad. When it's good, it's really good, but when it's bad, it's really bad. The best thing I can say about this film is that It's a strong directorial debut for Jordan Peele. He puts a noticeable amount of effort into this film and it's clear that this material is something he really cares about. Everything looks great, sounds great, and offers great performances across the board.But this film really feels like a tale of two halves. The first half of this film is mostly positive. It offers some strange and surreal sequences that do make you feel uncomfortable. But, at the same time, there's also incredibly obvious racial commentary. It feels like the idea for the film was created before the story was. So we get a variety of great ideas for scenes that don't quite connect to make a cohesive whole.For example, the opening scene. We watch as a black guy gets abducted as he walks about the streets. OK, but why was that in the film? It's not really apart of the main story and doesn't offer anything much aside from a minor set up for later on that we didn't need. Is it a cool scene? Sure it is. It's all shot in one take and does have blatant satire but it's a good idea for a scene.And that's the biggest problem with the film. It mostly feels like a collection of good ideas that were poorly thought through. The execution rarely falters but the script feels like a first draft. The main story, satire aside, is basically none existent. But that's OK because there's social commentary to fill that void. The only problem with that is the satire is so obvious and so on the nose that it rarely left me with anything to dwell on. It's always spelled out for you to the point of it feeling like it was hitting you over the head.This is the most frustrating part especially coming off 'A Cure for Wellness'. Which not only had a solid story holding your attention but subtle, strong political and social commentary for anyone paying attention. And you really had to pay attention to see it, which is something 'Get Out' simply doesn't do. The oddest part is that the commentary all but evaporates by the end of the film. The crazy, violent things you expect going in start happening and it seems to completely lose its edge.It turns into this violent quest to survive but and that was great and all but I completely lost any sense of satire. Which was the only thing carrying the first half of the film. It's bizarre that the payoff to all this obvious satire isn't anything but mindless violence featuring characters that the film barely bothers to develop. 'Get Out' isn't the film it could've been. Its heart is in the right place and it has a good message in there. But the message is bogged down by how in your face it is and the fact that there isn't much more to the film other than that.",6,8,22,2 March 2017
Room," Room is not as good as everyone says it is.
","Room stars Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. It offers Larson her best performance of her career and Tremblay a break out role. While he may not quite get past the whole 'kid actor' stereotype he is admittedly better than almost every other child actor out there today. Both of these actors are receiving some serious awards buzz right now, as is this film in general. This may be due to the odd nature of its plot line. A mother and child are stuck inside a room for at least five years of their lives. Trapped inside never once going out to see or experience the world. So, when they get out we watch as this child gets to see everything for the first time.Yes it's an interesting plot that hasn't really been done before but it can't really pull it off. It's odd that it struggles so bad with making this a worthy adaption of the book seeing as the author actually wrote the film. Much like last years 'Gone Girl'. However 'Gone Girl' actually had a good director.The one other film this director had done was 'Frank'. So I had high hopes for this film. Unfortunately, he may have proved to us that he is a one hit wonder. Because this film is not near as good as everyone is saying. This mainly steams from sloppy writing. Writing that would've probably worked in a book format. In that format you are able to show characters thoughts and feelings far easier than in film so you have to write accordingly.But this doesn't happen. This is really the only reason this film fails. But it fails hard. From the first scenes of the film it was pretty clear that not enough thought went into making this a piece of cinema. Characters actions and reactions to everything feel absurdly artificial. Like a cop figuring out where the room they lived in was from one extremely vague sentence. Or how the film seems to pretend like these two had never made one single escape attempt.Literally the second escape they try gets them out. I couldn't help think that they had never actually tried, because the guy didn't even hesitate to buy into their trick. In fact not one person in this film reacts naturally. Everyone was an extreme version of a normal person and it made nearly everyone in the film super unlikable. Especially the main two characters. They did virtually nothing aside from scream at whoever they wanted for no apparent reason. Almost every conversation ended in an annoying screaming match between random people. A screaming match that either made no sense or just made you dislike the characters. So, when these two get out it's hard to legitimately care about them. You don't know anything about them other then the fact that they liked yelling for no reason.'Room' may have strong performances and an interesting idea to back it up but not much else. It has a hard time making you actually care about its characters. No one reacts like a human being but instead yells at each other when ever they feel like they need to. It wastes its best qualities with a limp and lifeless script that fails to appropriately adapt the acclaimed novel.",5,66,146,29 December 2015
22 Jump Street," Best comedy of the year.
","22 Jump Street is the latest summer comedy. It features Jonah Hill as Shmit and Channing Tatum as Jenko once again. But not everything is as it seems....no wait it is. 22 Jump Street has an identical plot to 21 Jump Street. Go undercover, find the dealer of a new drug, and take him or her down. Its usually very hard for a sequel to do any better then the original. But 22 Jump Street lives up to and in some ways passes 21 Jump street. Yes, the premise is the same. But it seems like this film had more energy pumped into it. I don't know if it was better acting, directing, or jokes but whatever it was it worked. The film moves along quickly with Jonah and Channing hoisting it up. With out their energetic honest performances this film very well could have flopped. Putting their soul into every joke and scene. It really made for good cinema. And once the film nears the end It gets even better. The jokes fly at 100 miles per hour. They never stop, even through the clunky bits. There are moments in the movie that are wasted or could've been done better. For example, The scenes when the leads get high unexpectedly. This also happens in the first film and its a riot. But here its only used to serve later in the movie. Which is good but it really didn't do anything and wasn't that funny. Its also surprisingly unpredictable. New clues popping up about the investigation left and right. Pointing to different people each time. It's fun to see each shred of evidence actually mean something. And once everything connects and you see the true drug dealer it catches you off guard. Once the this movie hits the credits it even gets better which is always a great thing. Showing fake parodies of future Jump Street movies. It was hilarious. All in all 22 Jump Street is a slight improvement on the first. Yet a lazily written plot holds this film back from greatness. The heart and soul that jonah and channing put in is well worth it on its own. This movie is hilarious and fast paced. Nearly, the perfect summer blockbuster.",8,0,3,4 November 2014
X-Men: Apocalypse," Muddled, long, and clich√©.
","'Apocalypse' is a very odd film. It's kind of the sequel to 'Days of Future Past' but it's set before the events that we see at the end of 'Future'. So, it's a sequel, prequel to 'Days'. At this point everything that is happening in the X-Men universe is very difficult to follow. There are so many different stories being told in separate times and places. This film tries to capture every single one that is happening around this time period. For some reason Magneto is like retired or sometime and has a family I guess. And Raven is running around saving other mutants inexplicably. After the film wastes about thirty minutes setting all these characters up it actually gets going. I can't understand why Singer felt it necessary to reintroduce these characters as if we had never seen them before. It takes so much time early on showing what every single person is doing that It's hard to connect with the story later on. We don't need to see what literally everyone is doing or how they are doing it.Not only is that a waste of time but it robs the actual main characters of having any character. We don't need to see how Angel or Nightcrawler got where they are. We don't need to spend twenty minutes with Magneto's family that we all know is going to die. And with in thirty minutes, oh what do you know! They totally die for no reason. Having a main character filled with rage over the death of two dimensional family members is so clich√© at this point that I actually burst out laughing when they died. Like a guy double kills his wife and daughter with a bow and arrow without even looking. Why did this guy have his bow drawn in the first place? He was being attacked by birds but still had his bow perfectly aimed at them and just happened to let go of the arrow.It was absolutely ridiculous (and hilarious). Of course this plot convince spurs Magneto to join Apocalypse's band of misfits but really? How many times has that been done before? And if that hadn't happened would he have not joined the bad guys? It seemed like a lot was hinging on that moment and it was freaking stupid.And lets talk about Apocalypse. Not only was he as clich√© a villain as you can get but his climatic fight scene was ridiculous. We literally watch him decapitate people with sand but once we he is fighting the X-Men he just kind of tosses them around. How can I feel threatened by a villain that is this atrocious? He's a big deal in the comics but he amounts to zippy zap on screen. He gets beat up a lot and does nothing about it.But he'll turn around and annihilate an entire city within seconds of stretching out his hand. Granted these scenes where pretty cool though. That's really the only thing that carried this film. The action sequences. Everything in between them is rubbish but when the action hits, it hits big and hard.And it's elevated by superb performances from McAvoy, Isaac, and Fassbender. Fassbender in particular (Magneto). The scene in Auschwitz is arguably the best sequence in the film thanks to his performance. You really feel his pain and rage as he tears everything around him apart, screaming at the air all the while. It was the only powerful thing that the film had to offer.If anything, I was thoroughly entertained while watching this. There was three or four excellent sequences that blew me away. One including Quicksilver that even up staged 'Future Past's scene. But aside from the technical aspect of the film and some great scenes there isn't much here. The characters a flat, the plot convoluted, and the story bloated with far more personalities than the film could handle.",5,0,9,3 June 2016
Ex Machina," Perfectly Executed.
","FINALLY! 2015 has, at last, unveiled it's first great film. Ex Machina is quite a simple film. It centers on a lonely tech coder, Caleb (Played by Domhnall Gleeson). Who previously starred in the small film, 'Frank'. He wins a staff lottery that allows him to meet the companies reclusive CEO, Nathan (Oscar Isaac). Upon arrival to Nathans back woods estate he realizes he hasn't come to simply meet this derailed billionaire. He promptly signs a lengthy discretion document and is introduced to AVA, a prototype Artificial Intelligence. Caleb is tasked to test her to decide if she has a human like consciousness. OK, maybe it's not as simple as I made it out to be but it's when the film gets off and running that the plot becomes fairly simple. For the remaining 90 minutes the film is only set on testing AVA. Alone this plot line is fairly bland. But Alex Garland (writer and director) has some tricks up his sleeve. The more we learn about each character the more Nathan and Caleb clash. This creates an extremely intriguing power struggle. Both using their knowledge and wits to try and outsmart each other. While the film masquerades wholly as the bond built between AVA and Caleb the real meat of the film is in the quieter moments between Nathan and Caleb. It's a completely unique story dynamic. What helps to boost the story is the stars performances. Isaac delivers a fine performance as the head strong, self confident man who fancies himself God. While Gleeson is great as the quiet, insecure, average human being. He is the one we as the audience connect with most. The simple man thrust into a completely foreign area and tasked to fulfill a seemingly impossible task. These two are fabulous in the film but it's Alicia Vikander (AVA) that comes as a revelation. Delivering a mysterious, bold performance. She encapsulates the AI's mannerisms so perfectly it feels like she was born for this role. The film, like it's characters, is highly unsettling. There is a palpable aura of dread that surrounds 'Ex Machina'. The pieces of it's sinister puzzle unfold at Hitchcockian proportions, even if some of them are rather predictable. But this isn't the 'Sixth Sense', where we get one massive twist at the end. No, this is like riding a roller-coaster that is the record holder for most cork screws in one ride. Some turns hit exactly how they intend while others drop lazily to the side all to predictably. As each twist unravels the film plunges deeper towards it's inevitable madness. Once we finally reach this point it throws everything it has at you. Every little detail it went over creeps up and makes a gut wrenching appearance. It's impossible to leave 'Ex Machina' fully satisfied because the film wants to be this way. There are questions left unanswered and threads left untied. This benefits the already thought provoking script. It leaves the door open for hours of post movie discussion. 'Ex Machina' is a simply complex film that takes the all to familiar AI genre and effortlessly redefines it with a great cast, thought provoking script and intensely unsettling tone.",9,5,13,25 April 2015
Sing Street," Optimistic and well paced but rather standard.
","Here is one film that is getting quite a bit of recognition straight out of Sundance. While it didn't come to many theaters, the general consensus is that it's pretty great. So, naturally, I went in with high expectations. However this film is unfortunately quite standard. It's about a young man who finds a girl that he likes. She tells him that she is a model, so to get her to notice him he says he is in a band and wants her to star in a music video. Of course he isn't actually in a band so he recruits some kids for said band and they start writing some songs. From here the film follows a pretty cut and paste love story formula. The only thing really new is the music.Which was pretty great. The soundtrack in the film is one of the better ones that I have heard all year. With its main characters being in a band the music can not only accompany a scene but can interact with it. The lyrics in many of the songs are written by said main characters so they obviously directly correlate with what we are watching on screen. Then are the songs that just in the film to heighten a scene.Those songs are pretty great as well. Another interesting aspect to the film is the cast. Most of which are all but unknown. And for the most part they do a pretty decent job. There are a few of them that struggle but thankfully those actors screen time is held to a minimum. But the ones that do a good job are all the more impressive because the amount of the different things they have to do.They don't have to show a whole lot of range though, because this film is on the optimistic side. There aren't many moments of conflict in the film and that works for the most part. It keeps everything very upbeat and crowd pleasing. That being said, whenever it does try to introduce conflict or stakes it doesn't land very well. Which mainly encapsulates this movies entire B story.The B story mainly follows our main characters struggles at home. Where his parents and brother are going through an existential crisis. This side story doesn't pop up all to much through the movie so when it does it feels oddly forced and clich√©. It's nothing we haven't seen before and it doesn't do much to change that. This has mainly to do with all side characters being flat as a board.There isn't anyone outside of the main few characters that are even remotely compelling. While this mainly affects the B story, the main story we have isn't really that great either. This doesn't have to do with the bland characters or it's abundance of optimism, it has to do with the overly familiar plotting. The whole, trying to impressive a girl with something your not story has been used hundreds of times over.It's hard to call this movie good when it doesn't offer anything interesting with its story. Its characters are fairly bland, the story is overly familiar, and it doesn't have any conflict to really get you invested. But Its cast and soundtrack are good and there's a decent message embedded deep in there somewhere. While, I may not enjoy these types of feel good movies but if this kind of film appeals to you, you'll definitely have a good time with this one.",6,2,6,19 July 2016
Guardians of the Galaxy," Marvel finally made a great movie.
","Marvel has a reputation for being the best of the best at summer blockbusters. This film is no exception. It's going to make A LOT of money. And for the first time in quite a few years, a Marvel film actually deserves it. Following Peter Quill or Star Lord played by Chris Pratt. The not so notorious outlaw. As he is sent to retrieve a odd orb from a desolate planet. Turns out quite a few others are also after the orb. This leads to the meeting of the other guardians of the galaxy. Rocket played by Bradly cooper a genetically modified raccoon meant to be comedy relief , Gamora Zoe Saldana a vicious warrior, Drax Dave Bautista a deranged killer, and Groot Vin Diesel a practically invisible tree. The visuals are unmatched just like any marvel movie. As they should be since 2 of the leads are completely CGI. Besides the jaw dropping visuals the characters here are equally well done. We learn deep and engaging things about each one which will make you fall in love with them. Usually a film with this many main characters some are forgotten or the bonds between them and the others are thin. But Gaurdians does a brilliant job of developing strong bonds between each character individually. While the leads are extremely well done the villain is once again forgotten. Marvel has a tough time making a villain that is unforgettable. While Locke is the closest they've gotten its just not enough. Ronan played by Lee pace was under done. Although he had more motive then most of marvels villains he is still quite forgettable. Another forgettable aspect is the story. All though intriguing and mysterious. It is quite predictable right from the start. The orb that everyone is after seems stupid and useless. But you cant help but think of why everyone wants it. Once you figure out what is and does THEN the story falls prey to Marvels usual ridiculousness and predictability. Even tho the over the top ending feels more coherent then any other Marvel flick. All in all Guardians of the Galaxy is a well crafted summer blockbuster filled with heart, great characters, amazing VFX, and an ending that wraps things up nicely. Even tho it has a predictable story the only real weak link is the under done villain.",7,5,12,4 November 2014
Shrek 2," The constant references are a little much
","I can't say this hasn't dated, because it has, but not in the way you'd think. The animation is surprisingly, not bad. Faces and human models are a little rubbery and have awkward movements but the textures/environments are alright. The way it's aged though has a lot more to do with the constant references. I remember the original doing this (haven't seen it in years) but not to this extent. The first ten minutes are stuffed with nothing but references on top of references. It's like watching an episode of Family Guy. The story too has pretty heavy handed social commentary. That said, I still enjoyed this. The fantasy parody doesn't land as hard as the original Shrek, but they do attempt to tackle other things instead of rehashing the original. The cast is great including the new voice actors and there are some genuinely funny moments. What I'm saying is, it's a mixed bag.",6,0,0,6 July 2020
Prisoners," Could be the best movie of 2013
","In my opinion Prisoners one of the best movies of 2013 if not the best. It opens on 2 family's getting together to have a fun night. But that is quickly ruined when the little girls from both families are missing. And it proceeds to weave a dark, intelligent look at what people will do to get the ones they love back. The cast is superb all receiving their share of character development and making you feel as if you are apart of these families and experiencing what they are going through. Prisoners mainly follows Hugh jackman and jake Gyllenhaal. Hugh jackman, the father of one of the missing girls doing everything to get his daughter back from stakeouts to torture. And Gyllenhaal the stone cold detective assigned to the kidnapping case. Putting on display Gyllenhaals uncanny ability it inhabit this character and bring a level of humanity that you don't see in your average film.Both have impressive performances. Specifically Hugh Jackman. Taking a step away from Wolverine is refreshing and puts on display his acting range. Serving as a reminder that he is more then just a guy with side burns. The scenes were he is torturing a possible suspect for information are not only hard to watch but surprisingly emotional. Maybe a little extreme but really putting in perspective how far you may be willing to go for the people you love. But They are brutal scenes and are not for the faint of heart. Prisoners also is able to deliver a great plot twist as well. Not just one either. The whole film feels like are constantly on a roller coaster ride. But Just when it feels like the ending is gonna go all Hollywood and mushy on you it takes a dark turn. Not saying that this movie isn't dark already but this really takes a turn. Trust me. Overall Prisoners is brilliantly well crafted thriller chalk full of tense sequences, Fantastic performances, and a feeling of humanity you don't get in other movies.",10,0,2,4 November 2014
Silence," Silence is a near masterpiece.
","The latest film from acclaimed director Martin Scorsese comes in polar contrast to his last film, 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. Where that film is all about indulging in excess and living a very in the world life 'Silence' is literally the complete opposite. It's a film that is all about human nature, acceptance, and all that that implies. There's no nudity, no language, and hardly any violence. It's a film that relies on you as an audience member to be invested rather than trying to force you into it. However, the problem a lot of people are going to have with this film is the run time. This film runs just under three hours. Which, compared to the endless ninety-minute features we are getting, can be quite a daunting task to take on. It's not the 'epic' it's being acclaimed as, but it certainly is an experience. Or maybe even a journey yet, this film almost goes out of its way to not be an epic. It spans countries and eras but it manages to feel small and personal. This is why 'Silence' is a film that will go down in history as a landmark in contemporary cinema. If any film will be studied in film school for decades to come, it will be this.Much like 'The Revenant' the star of this film is the director. The direction here is incredibly precise without being show-offy. There's hardly any shot that felt out of place or over stylized. Which is why Scorsese is definitely the star of the film. It's so breathtakingly beautiful but it's never false or phony. With any other director at the helm, this film would've turned out over stylized or too fake for the content.It's not only beautiful to look at but it's themes and messages are equally beautiful. I realize that a film that's mostly about religion might turn off a lot of people but it does so much more than being just a religious film. It advertises itself as an emotional, spiritual experience, but it's more about human nature. It asks questions about humans and why we are the way we are. And it couldn't have come at a better time. Not only is this about human nature but it also brings in themes of acceptance and cultural barriers. In a time where humanity is rather divided, 'Silence' takes these questions head on. And as the credits roll, I sat in a stupor of thought that lasted until the pre-credits for the next show started up.While we are on the subject of positives, I want to talk a little bit about the characters/performances. Both of which are great. Every single actor in this film (right down to the extras) is absolutely incredible. Andrew Garfield is our main character and he gives a performance like I never knew he could. His efforts in 'Hacksaw Ridge' were admirable but here he actually has substance to work with and boy does he pull it off.As you go through this journey with him you can clearly see what this character is going through just by his physical acting. He is able to show an incredible range and versatility that I have never seen from him. Obviously, his other star roles were mostly in the 'Spider-man' films where he literally had nothing to work with. Which is why his performance in this film is all the more impressive.While I could gush over this film for hours on end I did find two chips in the armor of 'Silence'. One being the pacing/run time. While don't really have a problem with the run time, the pacing could've been a bit tighter in a few places. There were two or three scenes where I was on the verge of getting bored. It never quite happened but, in these scenes, the long run time can be felt. Flaw two would be a bit of pandering. There were a couple instances where the film blatantly spells out some of the film's undertones.This is a very mature, slow-moving film with a lot of moving parts and having it direct us in a certain way of thinking felt off here. Saying, 'You should be thinking about this right now.' is never a good way to go and especially not in a mature film that requires your attention. That being said, I absolutely loved 'Silence'. It's the third film I have seen in 2017 and so far it's the best. And it will stay that way for the majority of the year I think. If you're willing to give this film your time and fully invest in it, it will blow you away. Seek it out if you love movies or if want to see something completely original and impactful.",8,5,10,13 January 2017
Logan," Despite the action Logan is an unimpressive superhero movie.
","'Logan' is the first movie (minus Deadpool) in the X-Men universe to receive an R rating. Unlike 'Deadpool' this film is not a comedy. Far from it actually. This film is a brutal action movie filled with excessive violence resulting in a surfeit of blood, gore, and cursing. Which, surprisingly enough, is what any fan of Wolverine as a character has been waiting for. Finally, we get to witness Hugh Jackman tear people limb from limb in glorious, graphic violence. For this film, the biggest selling point, aside from the R rating, was the fact that Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are hanging it up after this film. This film will mark their last performances as their respective characters.So naturally, people want to see the only Wolverine they know be Wolverine one last time. And, thankfully, this film features an all around superb cast. Every actor in this movie is great with Jackman anchoring the film with his magnetic performance. Patrick Stewart also does a great job despite having fairly limited screen time. Even the young girl (X-23) did a fine job with what was given to her.But the crowning achievement of the film is the action. This director also directed 'The Wolverine' which was equally strong action wise. The difference between the two films is that 'The Wolverine' feels stifled by its PG-13 rating. 'Logan' does not have this problem. All the action is well handled and horrifically violent. Every time someone gets stabbed blood sprays all over the place in glorious detail.And it should be shown in glorious detail because the rating is the biggest selling point. Which is why you should see this with a crowd. It's the perfect movie to see with people and reveal in the excessive violence we have all craved. Every time Jackman and his little girl whip out their claws the film gets a burst of life and energy that really resonates with a crowd. So, while I would recommend seeing this with a crowd to experience the impressive action, I can't say that I liked this film.It's perfectly fine but the biggest problem comes in the form of the script. There are literally three screenwriters penning this movie. Writers who have such hit films as 'Marley & Me', 'Green Lantern', and 'The Wolverine' under their belt. Despite having three people looking at this script for who knows how long, it still feels like a first draft. Why? Because there is basically no story. Where the last Wolverine film was almost incoherent with its bloated story, hardly anything happens in 'Logan'.The first thirty minutes is set up followed by an action scene that all works very well but the next 45-60 minutes is nothing. They go to a place and then leave and then go to a place and leave over and over again. It gets so repetitive and dull to the point of me actually falling asleep. In an R-rated X-Men movie. It's in this hour of time where we are left with so little story that you start to realize that there wasn't really a story to begin with.It goes something like this: 'Take this girl to this place Wolverine.' 'No. OK, fine I'll do it.' And that's it. After he takes thirty minutes to accept this job he then takes two hours to complete this thin plot and that's the movie. It's nearly an hour of filler in a two and a half hour movie. If the film had this hour of filler cut out we would have had a great, straight up action movie. Instead, we have an uneven, poorly paced, thin story where not much happens.Like I said earlier, this is a perfectly acceptable action film. It has all the blood and gore you could ever want. It really pushes its R rating in the way we all wanted it too. Couple that with great performances and we should have had a great action movie. But, instead, the film is horribly bogged down with poor writing. Three screenwriters is never a good sign and it really shows here. There are endless action scenes followed by even more endless filler scenes. What results from this is overlong, thinly plotted, and an unevenly paced the film.",6,6,19,2 March 2017
Drag Me to Hell," Nearly perfect.
","Sam Raimi is one of those directors that will forever be known for one thing. And that one thing just happens to be the first thing that he ever made. 'The Evil Dead' movies. So when you hear that he is back with another horror movie after so long, it's hard not to get excited about it. Unfortunately, I heard about it seven years late. Yes, this film has been out since 2009 and only now am I seeing it. Better late than never right? But I am exceedingly glad that I saw this film. Why? Because this is the best horror, comedy, parody movie that I have seen in quite a while. It has the campy visuals you'd expect from Raimi but never has he had more of a grasp on the genre.That's because he knows the genre so well. Watching this movie with friends ascents exactly why. Through the whole film, all you're trying to do is call the next thing that is going to happen. When the next jump scare will be or what the plot twist is. And you may be able to call certain things, of course, but the film is constantly trying to make you think you know what is going to happen next.It knows exactly when there 'should' be a jumpscare and instead positions the scare right where you'd expect but it doesn't jump you. It may slowly lean forward into the light and then attacks. Which creates real tension. When you get jump scared what happens? You jump out of your seat and then laugh at yourself, right? When that happens all sense of tension is immediately gone. While this movie certainly jumps you it actually does it with the monster. And when that happens you get startled but now you're even more scared of what could happen. This film does a great job of using real jump scares and not those silly false scares. Plus, the jumps actually occur in the films universe. It isn't trying to scare you, it's trying to scare the characters. And that plays so much better for a horror film.But outside of being effectively frightening, what does it do? It's funny. Even though it's an effective horror it's also an effective gross-out comedy. Where a ladies head might head get hit and her eyeballs fly into a characters face. This is what Raimi does so well. He is a master of balancing tones. He effortlessly switches between humor and horror within seconds and it never feels out of place. ‚Äã Which can be a nearly impossible task. But he knows what he's doing with this genre. He knows exactly how the camera should move, exactly what lighting to use, and how this story should play out. Which proceeds in a breathtakingly simple way. Within twenty minutes we have our characters motive established, the villain's role built, and the scares are already coming. Raimi knows that less is more for horror films. And with a few lines and even fewer scenes, we know and care about what is happening. We know why choices are made, why things are happening, and it flows beautifully. Every scene, regardless of how it feels in the moment, pushes the story forward. It never stops and has a scary scene and then moves on. It has those in the moment.It shows you that this girl is under constant turmoil everywhere she goes. At work, in her car, in her house, everywhere. There is hardly a moment when she isn't, and that helps sell why she is so incredibly nervous everywhere she goes. She is consistently looking over her shoulder, praying nothing happens to her. And that really helps you relate to her struggle. It's easy to get on board with her.And when she starts to crumble under the pressure you want her to raise above it. But, unfortunately for us, the movie knows this too. And just when you think you know where the film is going, it pulls the rug out from under you and rolls the credits. For most this will be very frustrating. Because it refuses to play out the way it 'should'. It pretends that it will for a little bit but refuses to do what you'd expect.It's really one of the greatest horror movies out there. Everything in front of and behind the camera comes together to make a nearly flawless film. It's tense, hilarious, beautiful to look at, intelligent, and most of all, a blast to watch. Nearly every element of the film, down to the soundtrack, just works. And yes, it can be hard on your first watch because of how different it is, but trust me when I say that it just keeps getting better the more you watch it.",9,1,3,16 September 2016
The Fly," Still solid
","I would love to read the childrens book, 'Brundle Fly'. I can already see the horrified expressions on the kids faces. As for the movie, there were a number of times when I myself had a horrified look on my face. The body horror stuff is legit great, to this day. Watching Jeff pull his nails off is one of the most grossed out I've been. Goldblum too is great. He gets both more greasy and manic as the movie goes along. It's pretty well structured in that respect. Its a pretty slow ramp up as Brundle Fly becomes more and more fly like. However, both the story and characters are a bit thin. You've nerdy, isolated doctor who falls in love with spunky reporter. Nothing crazy there. Then after Jeff teleports with the fly it really is scene after scene of Jeff getting worse little by little. Which would be fine if the characters where better, but they are equally repetitive. It's still a pretty good movie overall though. Howard shores music is amazing, the effects look awesome, the performances are generally good, and the story is pretty unique even if it's a bit thin. (The only effect that doesn't look great is the full body costume at the end. Telefly on the other hand is awesome)",7,0,0,8 May 2020
Don't Breathe," Unnessarily over the top.
","From director Fede Alvarez comes his second feature film, 'Don't Breathe'. His first being the reboot of 'Evil Dead'. If there's one thing that a horror film can do for a director its shoot them into the limelight. Mainly because they are typically cheap to make and, like this one, don't require a complex narrative. It's more appealing to studio's and audiences eat it up. There has been quite a few gimmicky horror movies this year but this is for sure the best. Unlike those other films, this one looks great. It's easily the most cinematic horror movie I have seen in quite some time. Everything from the direction to the framing, color pallet, and the movement of the camera looked and worked incredibly well.But the most important question to ask when you see a 'horror' movie is, is it scary? While horror and comedy are especially subjective, I think I can easily say that this one just works. It's driven by thick atmosphere. This mainly has to do with both the look and the premise. Now, the story is very simple. Three kids decide to rob an old man after finding out that he has at least $300 thousand stashed in his house.What they weren't expecting was that he isn't just a docile old blind man. It's a classic story about random people that get in over their heads and are slowly picked off. In fact, it reminded me of the slightly better 2016 film 'Green Room'. It actually follows the same story almost to a T as that film. But instead of the basic home invasion film that we see a whole lot, this one flips it around.Instead, our main characters are the robbers rather than the people being robbed. The first thirty minutes of this film are nearly perfect. It sets up basic info about our characters, their robbing abilities, and demonstrates the brutality of the man the pick to rob. Not to mention the subtle hint that the old man may just be a victim in all of this. It could not have been a better set up.Where it starts to falter is when it makes the old guy the villain. If it were to keep him and the main characters as murky human beings, this film would've worked extremely well. It would have transcended the basic us against them film. And it would've become a film where you aren't sure who to root for. But what we got is the two-dimensional horror flick everyone expected. Even though it kind of turned into an unoriginal horror film, I still had hope. It was still very tense and simple enough to be fun, but it really derails near the middle. Where the villain becomes a B-grade comic book bad guy. With a completely unnecessary plot twist, the film turns this almost relatable old man into an utter psychopath for no reason. It was from this point on that nearly everything became nonsense. Beforehand almost every scene felt like it belonged in the film. But after that point, almost every scene seemed to end with a question mark. Guns suddenly had infinite ammo until it was convenient not to, the old man suddenly had the magical power of teleportation, and spare keys were randomly hidden away in safes for some reason. But the biggest issue with the film is that it had no idea when to end. There were two or three times where I swear it was going to end and it just didn't. There was a hilariously out of place and forced moment involving the old man and the main girl that lasted way too long. Then she managed to get out of that situation with the help of another dumb plot twist, then there was some running around, and then it just kind of ended.It was like twenty minutes of the film but it felt like hours were going by because none of it felt like it belonged. It was really in the last half of the film where things started going off the rails. Everything before hand was very well executed and tense with some beautiful visuals to boot. But the latter portions of this movie just did not work for me. Really nothing felt like it connected to anything because it seemed designed to simply shock. That was it. It didn't want to be a film, it just wanted to shock its audience. But instead of building around that shock it just kind of threw it in there. Even though I respect this film and can give it a passing grade, it's not one I will ever see again.",6,1,4,16 September 2016
Beauty and the Beast," Fine if superfluous.
","Recently Disney has become fixated on remaking, rebooting, or re- imaging their older films. This film is the third live action remake of one of Disney's classic animated films. So this is a remake of an animated adaptation of a french fairy tale (working title). If you haven't seen the classic animated film or just don't remember it the story goes as follows: Lady falls in love with monster. Of course there's underlying theme's and messages to take away but that's basically the story. It's simple and easy to understand. This is probably the greatest strength of the animated film. The story isn't over burdened by much else, it's just a love story with whimsical characters and house hold appliances that sing. It's in these details where this remake falls short. While it's essentially a shot for shot remake of the original there are a few things added. And every single thing added to this that didn't exist in the original feel so out of place and overly convoluted that it's hard to take them seriously. There's an entire subplot added to this film where Belle is attempting to find out how her mother died.It only comes up a few times and it's not really even written into the story. We have the original story and, all of a sudden, Belle discovers that her mom and dad lived in a windmill in Paris. Like, why? Why is this even included in the story? It doesn't add any depth to her or her father. It basically is just there to say that her dad loves her, which I think we can all reasonably infer already. There are various other added scenes and all of them feel roughly the same as this one. They all come from nowhere, add nothing, and then are completely forgotten about because they serve absolutely no purpose. This is where remakes become frustrating. On one hand, you want to see something new but if you go in a completely new direction people complain. And if you make a shot for shot remake, people complain.There's this tiny gray area in between these two extremes where a remake is almost acceptable. Look at 'The Force Awakens' for reference. While that film was essentially just a remake of 'A New Hope' there were new characters, a new threat, new environments, and new ideas being presented. 'Beauty and the Beast' falls just shy of being a shot for the shot remake by simply adding a new song or two and a few scenes.It feels like the same movie but with the deleted scenes added in. That's both the biggest flaw and greatest accomplishment of this film. It's obnoxious to watch a worse version of the same movie but where this movie works best is in the scenes that are pulled straight from the cartoon. Seeing this massive budget bring to life the jaw- dropping castle and characters was really neat.As much as I dislike Disney movies they do know how to utilize a budget. The sets, costumes, makeup, and CG all look spectacular. There were many scenes where I was left in awe of how good this movie looked and how much effort was seemingly put into making it look that good. And this is where all my respect for the film goes. They did an absolutely brilliant job bringing the cartoon to life. But that's, unfortunately, all this film is good for. It doesn't have an identity of its own. It wants to be the original but also wants to be its own thing and ends up being neither. There are some beautiful sets, costumes, and inspired recreations of the classics songs yet the film falters in nearly every other way. Its story is clouded by illogical and overly convoluted subplots that just sort of dead end and add nothing. While I am still strongly against remaking classic films, I can say that out of the three live action cartoon remakes we have gotten this is the best, but not by much. Just, make new things, please.",6,2,6,19 March 2017
"Hail, Caesar!"," Solid comedy despite a rocky narrative.
","Hail, Caesar!' is the Coen Brothers latest comedy....satire....thing. These brothers have directed such masterpieces like, 'No Country For Old Men' and 'Fargo'. (I'll stop with these two because writing all their awesome movies out would take far to long.) With all their excellent films backing them up, it was pretty much impossible for me not to be pumped for this movie. Especially with a cast list like this, wow. And after seeing this film, my expectations have been met. Not exceeded but, simply, met. The best part of this movie is, for sure, the dialogue. The Coen Brothers have always been known for sharp, snappy banter that they can effortless form between characters. And they do a fine job of exactly that with 'Hail, Caesar!'. The conversations that form before our eyes don't just flow, they bounce. They move with just the right amount of energy to give these simple lines on a paper, some pep in their step. It's what they do best because they are the best at it.Their lines can transform an eh actor into a good actor. Because they've already done half of the actors job. All to often in films today we have great actors trying to make an awful script sound okay. Not this movie. 'Hail, Caesar!' has great actors and great dialogue. But the reason that it's so good is because it builds on itself. Each character genuinely feels like they are talking to each other as people. Using back and forth to construct a natural conversation. It sounds so simple but, for some odd reason, this has become all to rare in cinema today. And since the dialogue evolves in a natural way, the humor lands ninety percent of the time. Because it feels genuine. The humor in the movie never comes across limp or bored because it feels like the people in the movie actually mean it. Yes, I know we are only a month into 2016 right now but this will most likely stand as one of my favorite comedies of the year.All this is well and good, but a movie would be nothing without a story. While, the story it has is certainly unique, it really isn't that good. Like, at all. Here I would normally point out one or two particular problems with the story but I can't. I can't because everything about the story is bad. The pacing is uneven, the twists make no sense, and (to top everything off) the movie runs for about thirty minutes too long.Mainly thanks to A LOT of unnecessary fat. The film is obviously trying to be a clever satire of the film making business and it is, but it does way to much trying to be just that. It leaves in scenes that feel like they should've been saved and released with the DVD as deleted scenes. Each time one of these scenes crops up the films comes to an uncomfortable halt. Although, it's often difficult to notice these scenes because of how hilarious they end up being.The Coen Brothers film knowledge and consistent entertainment continues to impress me. Yet, much like a few of their other works, 'Hail, Caesar!' suffers from an unfocused and, frankly, quite a bland story. It's poorly paced and sometimes extremely stale. That being said, this is a fun film. The cast seems to be enjoying themselves quite a bit, having been given a great script to work with. That helps to make this a pretty enjoyable ride although very flawed ride.",6,1,9,6 February 2016
Kong: Skull Island," Stylish, fun, trashy, and immensely entertaining,
","It's official, we finally have a franchise centered entirely around giant monsters. The films in this monster verse include 'Godzilla', 'Pacific Rim', and now 'Kong'. I gotta say, going into this film I expected the worst. I expected it to be the typical Marvel-esque film where it tries a little bit too hard to make you like its characters and ends in an unnecessarily over the top action sequence between an underdeveloped villain. But I'm happy to report that this film is not like that, at all. What is interesting about these three monster movies is that they all feel incredibly unique to the filmmakers. They all have a distinct voice and style that no other 'franchise' has. They are very much the director's film. Not the studios. This is one of the weirdest, most horrifically violent PG-13 studio films I have seen in quite some time. It actually remained me a great deal of 'The Great Wall'. Except this film seems to have a slight sense of self-awareness. This actually shocked me. It almost makes fun of itself and the films that are like it. It has the typical character sacrifice scene near the end except he just gets whipped a mile away from the action and just dies. It's not heroic, he just dies for basically no reason. It's scenes like this that really make this film work. Characters say goofy lines right before getting smashed to pieces, there's tons of color, and the camera is constantly on the move.In many ways, it feels like a Micheal Bay movie that is actually aware of itself. It knows how dumb it is and it plays it up to ludicrous degrees. I mean, a guy literally gets impaled by a giant ant for crying out loud. If you're taking this film seriously, you're doing it wrong. If you think this is just a typical action movie and aren't open to what is about to happen you'll probably hate this film.Because it is that typical action movie we all expected. The characters are flat as boards and they don't really do much aside from being smashed to death. Not to mention it features a giant monster that punches other giant monsters in their stupid faces. So, if you aren't ready to accept the fact that this film is almost making fun of itself then you probably shouldn't see this. However, if you want to see gigantic action set pieces and corny dialogue ripped straight out of the 1980's then boy do I have a movie for you. This is the first massive scale action movie in a long time that is just an action movie. It knows exactly what it is and it doesn't screw around with hardly anything else. It doesn't really bother setting up characters or anything like that. It shows us where all these people are in their lives and then it just goes.Within twenty minutes King Kong is tearing apart helicopters and crushing people to death. And from then on, the film does not stop moving. It's actually so frantically paced that you really don't have time to think about the paper thin characters or lack of story. It just goes from one action sequence to the next in such haste that nothing else really matters. That being said I do have one major flaw that almost ruins the entire film.The editing here is an absolute travesty. This film is so poorly edited that it's borderline incoherent. There are scenes that abruptly end and transition into a completely different area featuring the same characters. They will be in one place and without warning the film will cut to an entirely different location at an entirely different time of day but it stays with the same characters the whole time. The editing is so aggressive and rushed that even some of the action scenes move too quickly to get a sense for what is happening.But, aside from that, this film is thoroughly enjoyable. There a few parts that drag just a bit and that editing is in complete disarray, but I loved this film. It's such a breath of fresh air in a genre over saturated by people wearing capes that we vaguely care about. What 'Kong' does better than so many of these other action movies is that it just is a movie. It doesn't blatantly attempt to set up a sequel or take itself more seriously than it needed too. It knows that it's dumb and it plays on that. It's goofy, overblown, and often times downright weird, yet that's why I love it.",7,1,4,19 March 2017
Finding Dory," Why Pixar??
","Well it's been thirteen years but we finally have the movie that no one asked for, 'Finding Dory'. Following the huge success of 'Finding Nemo' it's hard to imagine that this film wasn't going to happen. Even if we all got down and begged Pixar not to, they still probably would have made this movie. So this time around, Dory is our main character. Yes, Pixar has completely made up a story to give to the side character that everyone loved so much. With in the first ten minutes Dory magically remembers that she has a family and goes on the hunt for them. Sound like the first the film? Well it is.It's exactly like the first one. Only the difference is that this one is really stupid. 'Finding Nemo' happened because Nemo was taken away from his father. Him and his father were the only survivors after some fished killed their whole family. So it made sense that Nemos dad would trek across the whole ocean to find him. The problem here is that you don't really care about what is going on at all. The story the film builds around it's characters is absolute nonsense. You mean to tell me that in the entire year that Dory was living with these guys no one bothered to ask her about her family? And that all those phrases that triggered her memory she was hearing for the first time in her life?I don't think so Pixar. As I watched this film it was apparent that this film was farted into existence. The film makers clearly just used this characters handicap to make up a pointless story. I mean they seriously could not think of any better way to tell the story then to just have her flash back like one hundred times?Not only is this incredibly lazy but it made the whole movie feel incredibly convenient. The films story is only taking place because of something that was completely random and ridiculous. Not only that, but they seriously could not have come up with anything better than just rehashing the same story? It's exactly the same story as the first just, the characters are playing slightly different roles.How on earth do the film makers think that one can be invested in this film if the first one was not only the same, but better? The first had real, relatable emotions and experiences going on. It was easy to connect with the characters and sympathize with their voyage. But this film doesn't do any of that. It just expects you to be blinded by nostalgia and love everything that is happening simply because you remember those characters.Which it does nothing new with either. There was really only one new character in the whole film that had any kind of personality. Aside from that every new thing we are introduced to is only just as a plot device. Other than that, their main purpose was to be comedy relief. Which was mainly pointed at making fun of other handicapped animals. If this film isn't subtly telling your children that you should make fun of handicapped people I don't know what is.While I certainly did not enjoy this film it isn't without its few saving graces. For starters, the voice acting is once again great. Ellen as Dory is closest thing to perfect casting I have seen. Her and the other actors involved really seemed to commit to their performances. And while the story as a whole isn't good there are a couple of great scenes in there. The scene in the kid zone is particular great. Seeing how these fish view these kids poking them and grabbing them is pretty ingenious. As a whole it is also very well paced. There was very few dull moments here. That being said, this film should not have happened. Not only is it a symbol of how far Pixar has fallen but how much they actually care about their audience. No longer do they desire to make quality pictures, no, it's all about the money now. This is very apparent thanks to how little thought was put into this movie. If you have kids, they might enjoy it. But if not, this one really is not worth your time.",5,54,112,17 June 2016
The Big Short," A decent, albeit flawed true story film.
","'The Big Short' stars Christian Bale, Steve Carrel, Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt, and a whole lot of others. It is directed by veteran comedy director Adam McKay (Anchorman). This is his first foray into directing a complex story and, for the most part, it works. The is about the market crash that occurred in 2007. How the worlds economy was propped up on loans that people either hadn't paid off or were behind on. Now, this is normally not a film that would intrigue any one. It revolves around banking and boring adult stuff that even adults don't seem to care about. But that is why 'The Big Short' succeeds. It takes this kind of boring concept and makes it interesting. Surprisingly enough this film handles its source material with relative grace. Of course the film is irreverent and in your face but it doesn't treat this material as a 'they cheated the system' type of movie. No, the movie blatantly shows these people trying, to no avail, to warn anyone who would listen about what was about to happen.It shows that, although these people became millionaires, they didn't want to see this happen. For whatever reason they saw what no one else could see and acted on it. This is what the film does best. It treats the material with respect (more or less). It is able to show that not one person even cared about how corrupt the system was. And that this wasn't something easily missed.It made this fact abundantly clear. In doing this it was able to show how scummy these big banks were. And it was also able to show that these characters weren't happy that they were the ones to find this. They knew how many people would lose their homes and lively hood if they were right.However this would not have had near as much impact if the actors playing these characters did a poor job. And each actor involved in the film was great. Each one was able to show their disgust with what they were finding and their longing to tell people before it was too late. It was hard to watch them go through this without losing yourself into this world that they were in.While the film does handle things fairly well, it can't escape the incredibly pretentious aura that emanates from it. Why it feels the need to stop and explain random things using uncomfortable celebrity cameos I will never know. The one thing I do know is that when the film announces them as a sports commentator announces a player it comes off incredibly out of place and pretentious.As I sat watching the film I couldn't understand why this decision was made. Or why the film felt like it should break the 4th wall for no real reason. Yes, it stays in line with the awkward, distracting documentary style of cinematography but other than that, there seems to be no explanation for this. So when the film decides to talk directly to the audience it makes the film become exactly that, awkward and distracting.Now, this doesn't make the film bad. I very much enjoyed 'The Big Short'. It was just the right amount of irreverent and dramatic to be both educational and entertaining. But why the film decides to present itself in an over the top unconventional style I will never know. It wants to be different so badly that it opts for uncomfortable scenes to be carried out in order to achieve this. When it does this I can't help but be slightly repulsed by how much the film feels like it needs to pat itself on the back.",6,0,3,6 January 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Crushing disappointment
","Three long years we have waited for this film. Finally a movie that pits some of the most iconic superheros of all time against each other. Since its announce three years back, the hype has been real. Then the trailers happened, and everyone realized what kind of film this could be. Especially when the second trailer they released spoiled literally the entire movie. But that is a two minute teaser. It can't capture everything this two and half hour movie has to offer right? Well, for the most part, it unfortunately does. If for some reason you haven't seen this infamous trailer count yourself lucky, as many of us where not so lucky.But that's just a trailer, I won't hold terrible marketing against the film as a whole, that's just something to think on. However, 'Dawn of Justice' may not be the movie you think it is. It isn't really a Batman vs Superman kind of movie, it's actually more of a 'Man of Steel' sequel.It majorly follows the man of steel as he is being put on trial for rigidity wrecking metropolis in the previous film. While that is happening Batman is whining and moping around, angry at Superman for destroying one of his buildings. A building that was chalk full of people that ended up losing their lives in this crap storm.Going into this movie there was a few things that I knew for sure that I would like. And all of which I ended up loving just as I thought I would. The biggest one was the action. Just like '300' and 'Watchmen' 'Dawn of Justice' is an absolute beauty to look at. Zack Snyder is one of the best in the business as integrating stylish choreography with exquisite VFX. Even if the effects get to be a bit heavy handed at times, there is no denying how great this film looks.Another thing that I liked about this movie was the idea of consequences. So many superhero movies these days leave large scale destruction in their wake with little to no repercussions. So, the idea of Superman being rejected because of how much damage he caused, despite the countless lives he saved, was an idea that I was way on board with. It seems that another film this year has kind of the same idea. Marvels 'Civil War' seems to be operating very similarly to this movie.But the one thing that is apparently separating these two movies is that both parties in 'Civil War' stand by ideals that we can get behind. The major problem with 'Dawn of Justice' is that it doesn't offer this. Superman is the only real good guy between the two. 'Well Rendan, Batman is a good guy too.' Not in this movie he's not. The best part about Batman and his villains is his refusal to kill people, even villains. And the villains are constantly trying to make him do it, to sink to their level.But in 'Dawn of Justice' he is a murderous lunatic that probably deserves more to be locked up than Lex Luthor does. He kills countless people and brands others. The movie takes his best quality, his moral dilemma, and throws it out the window. In doing this it becomes impossible to route for him in this movie. He is ultimately the villain, until he suddenly has a change of heart for virtually no reason.It's actually difficult to talk about this movie because of how nonsensical it is. So much of the film is spent trying to set up other movies that it forgets basic storytelling. Very few scenes make sense and even fewer feel like they actually belong. It jumps aimlessly from scene to scene with so little flow that each scene almost feels like it is restarting the movie. Characters do dumb things, people know stuff that they definitely shouldn't, and the action in the first half is completely non existent. And no, the dream sequences don't count. Why? Because they don't even matter to anything. Who cares if Batman kills a bunch of people, it isn't even happening. How can the film makers expect you care about what is happening if all of it is a characters head?There is many other positives and negatives that this film had like the great performances or the fact that the music is virtually ripped straight from 'Man of Steel' but these points where the most blaring. I wanted to like this movie, I really did. I loved the concept behind it, it had some excellent action scenes and set pieces but it was ultimately forgettable. The script is incredibly lazy, forcing in sequel set up where ever it could and in the process, it forgot to just be a good singular movie.",4,5,9,5 April 2016
Son of Saul," Absolute Masterpiece
","Very few movies have the ability to simply suck you into the world they create. But none have been able to do it as well as 'Son of Saul'. This has much to do with the films unusual aspect ratio. Shot in 1.37 : 1 the film is very reminiscent of standard definition format. Not only is it a square but the camera never feels our main characters side. Whether it's behind or in front of him, you only see and hear what he does. It gives the film a claustrophobic, uncomfortable feel. Which is probably what the viewer should be feeling considering the subject matter. Saul is a worker in the Auschwitz concentration camp. He and many others are tasked with cleaning up gas chambers, scrubbing blood off floors, and disposing of burnt corpses. After witnessing a child survive one of these gas chambers, living only for minutes after, Saul (Geza Rohrig) decides that he wants to give this child a proper burial. So, he searches for a Rabbi to bless him.It's fairly clear early on that Saul is doing this for redemption. Working in this camp has completely changed him. After seeing and doing nothing about all this injustice he seems to see this as an opportunity to actually do something good. But the film also has the balls to suggest that this may not actually be for the best. It asks you to consider what you would do in this situation. Would you protect the dead or the living people around you? It asks you which sacrifice you would make, and it tore me apart.Considering that this film is Geza Rohrig's first feature, he pulls off one of the best performances of the year. There is so much subtly that he has to portray and he nails it. You feel for him as you would anyone that went through this nightmare. Thanks to him Saul feels like a real person and it makes caring for him and his struggle undeniably visceral. Of course, it helps to have excellent writing to help round out Sauls character.Laszlo Nemes both wrote and directed this film. And just like Rohrig, this is first feature length picture. Holy crap. There are directors that have made countless pictures who haven't made anything close to this good, and this is his first. What he accomplishes in his direction is nothing short of outstanding. The film is comprised of many long takes with a lot going on. If you have seen 'The Revenant', this films cinematography and direction is a lot like that. Except this film doesn't have the luxury of wide takes. Which makes the direction all the more impressive. As the camera follows Saul through this we watch helpless, as everything happens just out of reach.Having nearly everything take place in the background, slightly blurred makes the trapped feeling the movie is going for all the more apparent. Not only that, but it never feels like it's giving a history lesson. It assumes that if you're watching this film then you know what happened during the holocaust. So, it never blatantly tells you what is going on.It leaves it just out of reach, in the background and puts you there instead of tells you to be there. It makes for a harrowing and uncompromisingly brutal watch. It never goes out of its way to tell you anything but instead shows it to you. It puts you in the moment with its complex characters and takes you on a journey with them. The result is one of the best films to release in past few years, and one that you won't forget for a long long time.",10,2,6,26 April 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A good, if flawed, film.
","It's finally here! Yes, this film does exist and isn't just a figment of everyones imagination. The most anticipated film of all time has finally landed. So, the question on everyones mind is, how good is it? (No, the question isn't, is it any good?) I think that by now everyone is convinced that This film will be good. But how good is it? The answer to this question is, it is perfectly adequate. Now, don't tear me to pieces quite yet. Here me out first and if you still want my head on a silver platter, that's fine. 'The Force Awakens' takes place roughly thirty years following the events of episode six or 'Return of the Jedi'. But this time we follow some new faces.Yes, the central protagonist of the original trilogy (Luke) is long gone. And we are left with two new faces. Rey, played by Daisy Ridley and Finn, John Boyega. Finn is a stormtrooper for a new empire called The New Order. Who seems to be following in the very large footsteps of Darth Vader. Needless to say, these are bad dudes. And Finn recognizes this very early on and escapes to Jakku.This is where we met Rey. A scavenger that roots through wrecked star ships to try and survive. These two join together in an attempt to escape Kylo Ren and the first order. It's a fairly simple story that has some great twists and turns. Twists that I will refrain from spoiling in this review.Aside from an interesting story 'The Force Awakens' offers some of the best sequences in any Star Wars movie. Thanks to careful direction from Abrams and spectacular set pieces we get some of the coolest action scenes of the year. It's easily the best looking and feeling Star Wars in the franchise. It's gorgeous to look at and a blast to watch.Not to mention it has a great cast and compelling characters. This is what I loved about this film. As the film moves along we see sides of the old characters that we never have. And the new ones are given their own distinct identities. The film wisely doesn't go to far though. It gives them just enough for us to care about them but not so much where the next films will lack new development. This allows Boyega and Ridley to shine in their respective roles.But this is not a perfect film. The most noticeable flaw was the lack of one central character. In the original trilogy there is certainly a slew of characters but there is no doubt that Luke Skywalker is the lead. 'The Force Awakens' doesn't have anyone like that. It takes so long introducing everyone that is going to be in the films, that no one becomes the actual star until the bitter end of the movie. We jump between so many different character subplots that it's sometimes hard to keep everything in line. There are other flaws like Gleeson feeling severely out of place, clashing between VFX and practical effects, and a handful of continuity errors but I will only touch on one more. Kylo Ren. While he himself is not a mistake, but the way the film handles him is. He is easily the most complex character in the entire film. This is because the film gives him (as I felt) a full, three film arc. By the end I was unsure where the next films could go with him because he feels like he has already reached his full arch. ‚Äã 'The Force Awakens' is far from a perfect film. It's bloated, melodramatic, and sometimes even clumsy. But there is no denying that it's a blast to watch. It's able to introduce new characters into its universe with ease. While, simultaneously, being one of the coolest, sleekest films to release this year.",6,0,6,20 December 2015
Godzilla," Fresh, big, and bold
","Following the astronomical failure of the 1998 American Godzilla movie, there was a lot of uneasy feelings surrounding this film. It almost seemed like it was going to make the same mistakes of the 1998 film. It was another American version and Godzilla was CGI again. However this film is, thankfully, dramatically better. One of the biggest reasons for this movies success is in large part due to Gareth Edwards excellent direction. Normally, I'm not the biggest fan of the 'boots on the ground' type of cinematography. Where the film is shot almost like a documentary. Most of the shots are only from angles that normal humans would be able to get.Inside of buildings, up from the street, and on top of skyscrapers. Again, I usually am not a fan of this style but for this film is actually works very well. Since the major threats of the film are three gigantic monsters this technique helps to give you a sense of realism. It makes these huge creatures have a sense of presence and scale.Being able to see how large these creatures are from a human angle really shows how monstrous they are. While Edwards hasn't shown that he can be a great director yet he has shown with the few films he's made that he understands how to give CG a sense of presence.Filming them mainly at night or in large cities. My favorite part of the film though is it's sound design. Whether it's the thunderous crashes of the creatures footsteps or the intimidating roars they emit, each sound is unique and well designed. Being able to associate noises with the specific monster further helped them feel like they were actually there.It was clear that the majority of the film makers time and effort was spent here because the story is pretty eh. It was difficult to get into things when our main character could remarkably go any where the monsters were. Sure he was in the military so a few times it made sense how he could be there.The problem is the entirety of the story revolves around these creatures. It follows them around to each area they go to. They wreck some stuff and then go somewhere else and repeat. Usually this boring, under developed plot would aggravate me a lot more than it did here. The main reason it didn't was because it never begs you to care about what was going on. It knows what it is and has fun with it. It gives a reason for it being in the place that it was and then showed you some awesome carnage. Because that's what you paid for right? To see these cool beasts throw down.Many will argue that the creatures didn't have enough screen time but I thought they were used just right. Showing them to much would have hurt the immersion of the film and to little would have made this very boring. But they were used just enough to make them intimating every time you see them. ‚Äã Obviously this isn't a perfect film. It's thin and sometimes a bit uneven but it's strengths far out weigh its weaknesses. It's fun, big, and bold. It creates a great atmosphere and doesn't beg for you get into the story. This makes it very easy to get sucked into the film and have a blast watching it.",7,2,4,7 May 2016
50_50," Tough and Tender
","50/50 tries to tackle a tough topic. Cancer. But this film really knew what it was doing JGL plays a young guy that is diagnosed with an extremely rare case of spinal cancer. With this cancer you only have 50/50 chance of surviving. After hearing the news everyone around tries to help. The film is hoisted on the shoulders of JGL who gives an incredible moving performance. Following his struggle as girlfriends, family, and just about everyone gives up on him. The cast all hand in their best outings to date even Seth Rogan gives a good performance. Even if he his only in the film as comedy relief. With a topic as tender as this one its pretty tough to get comedy worked into the story but thanks to a very well written script its balanced beautifully. The story itself is very basic but its so well written that it covers itself up nicely. Even if you haven't known someone with cancer this movie will break your heart over and over again. Its one of the funniest/most inspiring films you will watch All in all 50/50 delivers great performance, and a tight script to delivers drama and comedy in all the best ways. All though I was disappointed in Seth Rogans character.",9,0,0,4 November 2014
What We Do in the Shadows," Crazy Unique.
","What We Do In The Shadows is one of the best films to be released in 2015. Although there has only been two or three good films this year, I believe, even by the end of the year this will stand tall. This film has caused a stir in our zombie crazed society. Not since Twilight has a vampire film been so popular. (The only difference is Twilight sucked hard) Like 'District 9' it's filmed as a documentary or, more appropriately, mockumentary. The best part of this film is it makes the most of this style. Unlike 'District 9' which was pretty inconsistent with this highly controversial style.While it's not 'One of the flat-out funniest films in ages!' it does have some really hilarious moments. That is 'What We Do In The Shadows' greatest strength and most crippling downfall. The film is only memorable in it's moments. Not as a whole. It feels like a cluster of great skits that have been thrown into a feature length film. Sure this approach works with television shows such as 'Saturday Night Live', but not really as a movie.That aside this is a really fun film. As I explained earlier, the moments make this film what it is. From Werewolves swearing then quickly retorting by saying, 'We are Werewolves, not Swearwolves.' to vampires fighting on the ceiling. It's chalk full of memorable (and quotable) scenes and lines. While it may not have the hilarious one liners that films like 'Anchorman' possess, it does a great job of being new. It embraces all of the Vampire 'stereotypes' and puts them to funny use. We see some burnt to a crisp when exposed to daylight, fights between two as bats, and a handful of great lines remarking on their age. It brings Vampires into the modern world with such grace and reality it feels utterly real. This is in large part due to it's documentary style. We see camera men slaughtered by creatures and all forefront characters getting face time via interviews.With such a small film like this, usually the special effects are sub par. And for the most part you give them leeway for the budget they are working with. This is not the case with 'What We Do In The Shadows'. The effects have a Chris Nolan feel to them. Opting to go practical or CG. And it works so incredibly well. There is no point in the film were one will be taken out by an awful effect. 'What We Do In The Shadows' transcends the average film with it's great cast and extremely witty humor and blazes it's path to being an instant classic.",8,0,3,25 April 2015
Deadpool," It may lack substance but the action, comedy aspect is flawless.
","If you don't know who Deadpool is, he is an infamous anti hero who is known for not being bound to the rules of comic books or movies. He seems to be completely aware of who and where he is. Remarking on how this film may become a franchise or how he knows that the studio is tied to a budget. Listening to this character say exactly what you are thinking while still acknowledging the fact that he is in a movie is a blast. Of course, a movie is not a movie without a story. The films story may be quite thin and irregular but it is there, sometimes. Naturally we follow Wade Wilson (Deadpool) who becomes stricken with sever, late stage cancer.After he learns of this terrible disease he opts to take part in an experiment which would cure his illness but simultaneously make him invulnerable. With his new found powers he decides to pursue the man that gave him his awful butter face. Yep that's it, he goes on an hour and a half long man hunt because he was turned ugly.The films plot is ludicrously thin but it somehow works for this character. His utter disregard for basically everything may make it hard to create a meaningful story. Yet, they couldn't come up with anything a little more, you know, interesting? The only other fault worth mentioning is the villain.Do we learn anything at all about him? No. Are his motives and abilities defined and compelling? Nope. He is simply here to be the driving force for Deadpool. This coupled with the uninspired story can make for a rocky experience. There are one or two stretches where not a whole lot happens. I realize that the origin story needs to happen but it didn't seem necessary to make it near humorless at times.It was strange tonal shift that came as fast as it went. Thankfully so, as the rest of the film is incredibly fast paced and unflinching. This is what is so great about this movie. For once a Marvel film has held no punches. It's so crude and irreverent in its execution that even the new Pool fans will be abundantly pleased. The most impressive aspect though is the films humor.The movie walks a thin line with a character like this. It can easily go to far or vise versa. But 'Deadpool' straddles that line perfectly. It's ingenious use of fourth wall breaks, slapstick, and clever satire make for a timeless comedic effort. It very well could become the next 'Airplane' in terms of pure comedic ingenuity.Not to mention superb action sequences. They aren't overly edited or shaky to the point of nausea. No, they are crisp, clean, and use slow motion in the best way possible. This is again where its R rating comes in handy. It lets Deadpool be who is meant to be. Gritty and gruesome. Dismembering limps of both his enemies and himself. 'Deadpool' is exactly the movie fans of the character have wanted. It's gritty, brutal, and hilariously irreverent. Topped off with a pitch perfect Ryan Reynolds performance as the title character. 'Deadpool' IS the movie we have always wanted, but it isn't without flaws. Errors that should've been easy fixes that seemed to just be overlooked. That being said, if you like this character you will love this movie.",7,1,9,18 February 2016
John Wick: Chapter 2," Bland follow up to a fun action movie.
","When you see a modern day action movie there are really only a couple types you see. There are films that drive the action with an emotional core and then there are those that use an impossible situation to drive things forward. 'John Wick' used a dog and a dead wife to propel our hero back into action, utilizing emotion. 'John Wick 2' it's either of these. Which is why it fails. The film is a direct sequel to the original, taking place only hours later. We see him retrieve his stolen car and is then pushed into returning to action via a blood oath he signed with the wrong kind of person. This person uses John to kill a specific person for him and from this comes our action movie. Neither having an emotional core or any stakes.So what can we care about? Not much really. You don't really care about our main character because you don't know hardly anything about him and he is no longer driven by anger. And he isn't trying to fight his way out of an impossible situation, that is, until the second half. The biggest problems for me reside in the first hour of this film. Where we are left with nothing to care about or to be invested in.It begins with a mindless action scene that is completely pointless to this film that lasts for nearly twenty minutes. This is shortly followed by nearly forty minutes of nothing. A character sits down with John, tells him general exposition that he already knows, and then moves onto the next person who does the same thing. It's nothing. The first hour of this film is about as close to nothing as an action film can get.What's worse is that nearly thirty minutes of this first hour is literally worthless. There are countless scenes that go on for twice the length they should. Which mainly stems from characters just blatantly explaining things to the audience. Not only is it more interesting to tell a story through visuals but it's also less time consuming, but it actually takes some amount of effort.I guess this film decided that the easy route was the best route because the film is nothing but sitting around and explaining everything. Each and every detail is spelled out for the audience, drawing the run time out thirty minutes too long. And when the action finally hits, it's dull. This is the final blow that the film dealt me before I gave up. There is an extended scene that takes place in an underground catacomb that is so poorly lit, it's actually impossible to see anything.There is dust flying every which way, people running about, endless headshots, and it's all lit by a single light on the floor. It wasn't until some other assassin's tried to kill our hero that the film became interesting. From the point where Wick gets hit with a $7,000,000 contract on, the film is exactly what it should've been. A well lit, endless action scene that doesn't try to overstate things. And, guess what? We actually have a reason to care!The moment Wick gets double crossed is the moment that we get invested in things. We like punishments to reflect actions. So when our main character gets double-crossed/stabbed in the back, we want to see justice served. Boom, a conflict we can care about. While the second half has its share of issues it's significantly improved just by giving us a reason to care. And, outside of the catacombs sequence, the action in the film is great. It's everything you could reasonably expect. Well choreographed, shot in nice wides, and cut together with a decent sense of rhythm. The action just has a natural flow and brutality to it that it's hard not to praise. If there's only one thing to see the film for, it would be for the action. Specifically the last hour of said action. If you exclude the dull, lifeless, ugly first half (which you shouldn't) the film is a well-made action movie that delivers everything you could ever want. It just takes a while to get to that point.",5,4,8,2 March 2017
Annihilation," Gets better every time
","Upon first viewing of this film I was confused, unsatisfied, and frustrated. There was a lot I liked but an equal amount that I disliked. The film initially felt clunky and disjointed. After this last watch most of the issues washed away. I still don't think it's perfect, far from it, but there is A LOT that I competely missed the first time. My second watch felt far less disjointed and the pacing was a lot tighter. After just my second watch the experience of the film was far more enjoyable and I got a lot out of it. I love the themes presented here, I love the abruptness of everything that happens, and I love the ambiguousness of the project. Definitely need another watch soon.",8,1,2,30 September 2018
Warcraft," Not as bad as critics are saying
","Based of one of the most popular video games of all time,'Warcraft' tells the tale of orcs and humans fighting for their world. The orcs world is dying and one big bad orc opens a portal to the human world where they can rebuild. Except, they don't want to coexist with the humans. They begin destroying towns and taking slaves. Naturally the other people inhabiting this place aren't very happy about this, and they fight back. Now, I have never played the game and am not really a fan of Blizzard games. Even though I have never played the games I feel like this movie was one for the fans. (Even though most of those fans say this isn't like the actual story.) As I watched, there were many obvious things that were fan service that I didn't get. But when these things popped up they never really stayed for to long. I was happy that the film was actually trying to be a movie instead just fan service. That being said, this is a film that many people who haven't played the games will be frustrated with.It never goes into much detail about, really anything. Very few things are explained or spoon feed to the audience. While I appreciate when a film does this, this one didn't really know what it should and shouldn't explain. There are many things that, because I am not a fan of the game, didn't make sense. This is unfortunate because a film shouldn't be dependent on the thing that it's based off.You shouldn't have to read books or play games in order to get what is going on. This is the main problem with the film. There are far to many things that are left too vague. I shouldn't have to go through an extraneous process to get why a character is doing the thing that they are doing. I really had no idea who these people were and the film didn't do anything to show me who that person is.Even after two hours with these characters I was no closer to knowing them. Not a single one had any personality other than the motive that drove them. Not knowing or caring about the characters made the middle portion of the film very tedious. It cut between almost every main characters backstory back to back in the most sloppy way possible.It would show us a boring scene between two or three bland characters chatting about who knows what only to be cut off by a terrible transition. This happens nine or ten times. It seemed like the film knew it's characters sucked so it just jammed extraneous nothing into the middle and hoped you didn't notice. It made the 2nd act of the film so incredibly boring and tedious to site through.If you were to pull the majority of the second act from the film you would actually have a pretty good fantasy flick. For a movie that is being panned by critics it does a lot right. Most notably thanks to Duncan Jones and his direction. Because holy crap is this film pretty to look at. What I loved about it was despite the large use of CG It never felt out of place.This is mainly a product from having the majority of the sets be practical. Being in an environment rather than in front of a green screen seriously helps you believe that it really exists. But a lush world would be nothing without stirring music to capture the feel of the environment. And it does that very very well. This is made even better by the great cinematography. Watching as the camera navigates between giant book shelves or take on perspective shots is pretty cool to see. Doing this shows a level of grace and maturity that you don't see from many other directors today. It showed that Jones really cared about what he was doing and the effort put into every shot makes that sing true.Is it a perfect movie? No. But is it the disaster most critics are calling it? Of course not. The level of effort put into the technical aspect is unmistakable. It's very well directed and offers some really stunning visuals that your eyes can feast on. That being said, its story is pretty messy. It's uneven, poorly edited, and overstuffed. It tried to cram so much content in the film that it was impossible to really get involved in what was happening. If you're a fan definitely go see this but if not, it's probably best to stay away.",5,2,3,11 June 2016
Donnie Darko," Mad World
","Donnie Darko is one of Jake Gyllenhalls first major film roles. Now if you haven't seen This movie I'll tell you right now...Its confusing. Like really confusing. I usually pride myself in seeing what a film is trying to say and catching all the little things that happen. But I was pretty much completely lost. It follows Donnie Darko a young kid that is I guess, stalked by a 6 foot tall bunny. That is about as far as can say since I'm avoiding any kind of spoilers. So uh lets just go into the GOOD STUFF!Good stuff Like I said Donnie Darko features Jake Gyllenhall In one of his first roles. And He was fantastic. And it's not just him either. The entire cast is perfect and are all excellent. One thing that this film offers that not many movies do these days rewatchabilty or something. Now You can re watch any movie you want. But donnie darko is one film that the more times you watch it the more you understand. It's a lot like Inception in that regard. But unlike Inception Donnie Darko is kinda slowly paced. The movie does move quick and you really can't look away for a second or you'll miss something. But it feels slow while you are watching. There are Lots of things that feel like they don't matter at the time but when you hit the end and realize you blinked at a certain part you'll be hitting yourself for it.The Bad Stuff Donnie Darko is very confusing. And hard to follow on your first watch. Which is quite a turn off for lots of people. For me not so much but I recommend this movie to a few people and more or less they came back saying they didn't like it because they simply didn't get it. Verdict Donnie Darko is Jake Gyllenhalls first major film role and hes never really looked back. He delivers one of many astounding performances as does the rest of the cast. The film is also super tightly written as it needs to be to drive home its original (yet Confusing) ideas. The only real negative here is how confusing it is. But this is an easy fix by simply looking up Donnie Darko Explanation",9,0,2,4 November 2014
Macbeth," Macbeth is one of the best films of the year.
","The latest film adaptation of Shakespeares iconic play has arrived. This time the lead role is inhabited by Micheal Fassbender. Who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors working today. With every film he is in he seems to get better and better. Each role he is in he takes on perfectly. Not once has he felt miscast. 'Macbeth' is no exception. His performance in this hefty role is nothing short of superb. He is able to show the grief and inner turmoil that his character is experiencing at any given moment. It's an Oscar worthy performance that may very well be overlooked. In fact, this entire film will most likely be overlooked come award season. It's an unfortunate fact that has plagued recent award seasons. Every year there are great films, like this, that are passed over because they don't have the buzz some of the other films do. Although, this can be ignored if this film receives, at least, a nomination for its cinematography. It's clear from the first shot in the film how much effort was put into the cinematography. Every moment of this film is breathtaking. Even basic scenes of back and forth talking are gorgeous to look at. We get beautiful wide shots of vast mountains shrouded in fog and haunting close ups on characters faces. This is only made better by riveting direction from Justin Kurzel. His control over the film is awe inspiring. The film is under such tight control that the weather itself becomes a character. It displays such an impressive attention to detail. And near everything is shot on location. These vast landscapes give the film the beautiful yet haunting feel the film needs.Having the film play out outside of sound stages is able to give these actors a setting that they can legitimately react to. That being said, this film is one of the best acted films of the year. Even if it was entirely filmed on a sound stage it probably wouldn't have mattered. Cotillard and Fassbender are absolutely brilliant in this film. In a film that is heavy with monologues their honest performances are able to drive through even the hardest spots. And there are a couple of these moments. One specific sequence before the concluding fight scene is particularly difficult to sit through. In a film that cuts out a lot of unnecessary fat, this scene feels very out of place. During this ten minute spot the film screeches to halt. Fortunately, the film recognizes this and hustles into the best part of the entire film. The fight between Macbeth and Macduff. It's an impressively shot and choreographed scene that is infected with emotion. It does everything you'd want from a faithful adaptation of the play while also being separate from all the others. It's a gorgeous film that brings out the best from everyone involved thanks to impressive attention to detail from director Justin Kurzel. 'Macbeth' is a powerhouse of a film that deserves to be seen.",9,0,4,20 December 2015
13 Hours," It isn't without redeeming qualities but the majority of the film is bland.
","Well, if there was ever a movie for Micheal Bay to direct outside of 'Transformers' it would be this one. It has everything that he could ever want. Explosions, buff guys, American Flags, and explosions. The only real difference between this movie and the 'Transformers' franchise is that this one lacks giant robots duking it out over who knows what. But don't be fooled, this movie isn't any more streamlined than any of his other works. At least the 'Transformers' knew that they didn't have any chance whatsoever in developing its characters. So they didn't care to try. And that is the first, and quite easily, the largest misstep that '13 Hours' makes. There just isn't anyone to cling onto to help get us through the film. Even the great John Krasinski, the charismatic mastermind behind Jim halpert struggles to find any foot hold with his character. Not one single character in this film feels different from one another. Each one is a roid raged, dislikable version of who they are suppose to be.Each one is a family man with huge rippling muscles that are frequently put on display for us. And that's about it. Micheal Bay seems to have thought that putting an uncomfortable amount of man up on screen would make one forget that there wasn't anything that separated any of them. I could be wrong but....no I don't think I am actually.The biggest problem isn't that these people don't feel like they actually exist but that the movie tries so hard to fake development. For a solid forty five minutes the film pushes a whole lot of nothing on its audience. We get line after line of nonsense with the occasional fake action to make you think something is happening.But what whats actually happening is nothing. The more you look inward the more one realizes that the film has nothing to offer. The two and a half hour run time certainly doesn't help the films cause. It only helps to highlight even the slightest error. Of which, there are many.But it wouldn't be receiving so much praise if there wasn't redeeming qualities. Surprisingly enough, the best quality the film possess is in it's action scenes. When the camera isn't shaking violently you can actually see that Bay isn't a bad director. He knows how to create an involving sequence. Bullets fly, blood is shed, and heartstrings are plucked at.Another plus is the films sound editing. The sound is perfectly realistic and makes the intense action even more riveting. But I wish I could say I was impressed by more things. While, there is other minor positives nothing else is legitimately impressive. It's overlong, bloated, and devoid of any meaningful characters or messages. The action may be excellent but the film takes so crushingly long to get there that the majority of the experience is relatively bland.",5,11,29,8 February 2016
Sully," Structural issues abound.
","Clint Eastwood is back with yet another true story film. Unlike his last based on a true story flick, 'American Sniper', 'Sully' actually works pretty well. And it makes for a surprisingly gripping story at that. If you're unaware, the story is about an airline pilot. The same one that landed an airbus in the Hudson river in 2009. Naturally, this is his story. But it's told slightly differently than you'd expect. 60% of the film actually takes place after the incident and the other 40 is told through flashbacks that are triggered in some way. This was the aspect of the film that really suffered the most. There are so many flashbacks in this movie. There are so many that this otherwise engaging story starts to feel disjointed. There are one or two that feel genuine and work fairly well, but the majority are just crammed in where ever they could fit them. It felt a lot like 'Suicide Squad' in that, these flashbacks didn't really serve much purpose. They almost felt like they had too much footage and decided to just stick it in somewhere.The worst offender happens about twenty minutes in. The film opens after the water landing, of which we don't see. We see that Sully is being put on trial for endangering the lives of his passengers and crew. This plays out for about twenty minutes and is shockingly gripping I might add, and then it suddenly flashes to directly before the flight occurs. But it doesn't just end there. No, we sit for about twenty more minutes as we watch the entire accident occur.This scene, and many other flashbacks like it, come out of nowhere and overstay their welcome. This one, in particular, does nothing for the film other than blatantly show you exactly what happened. And that isn't really a bad thing, but when the first twenty minutes of your movie is board meetings, it feels out place to jump to this plane scene. We all know the story, and the film does a great job of showing it subtly.Yet, for some reason it stills shows the full event to you. It doesn't help push the story forward, nor does it build character. And, to make things worse, this very scene is shown again later in the film. With this second time actually feeling like it belonged there. When you tell a story like this through flashbacks, they have to drive things forward. A good example of this is 'Incendies'. But 'Sully' just pushes in random footage that rarely helps the film in any way. This effects the pacing drastically. Watching these engaging trail sequences to only flip to a flashback makes this movie more of a lame roller coaster ride. Where you'll be exhilarated sometimes and just bored the rest of the time. It doesn't help that the shooting style is rather bland. The visual style of the film is very mute and stationary. Which can work, but here it just looks boring.By now you are probably thinking that I hated this movie, but I didn't. In fact, I thought it was decent. This mainly has to do with the non-flashbacks aspects of this movie. When the film plays out uninterrupted it works very well. It's very restrained and subtle actually. The scenes that take place after the crash all felt like they served a purpose. Each one helped flesh out our main character or forward the plot with interesting new information that caused conflict.Conflict that actually felt like it had weight to it. Each new piece of info that Sully receives is almost always something bad. And each time you can see him sink a little more into himself. And watching this kind of hurts. You know that he's a genuine guy and saved hundreds of lives, but there's always consequences. So when you throw consequences in a film like this they actually carry weight.You don't want to see him put on trial because he just saved hundreds of people. But that's what happens, and it works very well. Of course, this couldn't have been accomplished without Tom Hanks. Who is typically great. The entire cast is actually pretty great. They all take on their character in interesting ways even if their character translates to nothing more than a line on a paper.However, 'Sully' is ultimately a frustrating watch. That mainly has to do with the fact that this could have been great and just wasn't. There's an excellent movie in there and it's ruined by jumbled storytelling. Excessive flashbacks grind the film to a halt nearly every time they surface and never really help the film move along. This along with a boring look and bizarrely abrupt scene changes really hurt an overall good movie. The cast, crew and investigation aspects of the film are definitely its saving graces. Without them, we'd be left with another True Story flick to throw by the wayside.",6,4,6,16 September 2016
