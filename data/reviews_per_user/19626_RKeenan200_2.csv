Hereditary," Dire movie.
","Let's try make a complicated horror - was probably the plan.
The result - not a horror anyway and if you have to resort to IMDB to work out what the hell you just watched then you've watched a movie that failed. This movie fails on all fronts. How it got a high rating is beyond me.

Da 5 Bloods," So, so bad
","The cast caught my eye, the plot sounded good and the trailer looked ace. That's where the enjoyment ended.
The writing in this movie is horrible.
Ok o get the flashback scenes but what really confused me was why didn't they cast younger versions of the Bloods? I didn't even realise the first flashback was that at first.
The shootouts are just awful. The script is poor and the movie was about 1hr too long. 2hr 35minutes I'll never get back.I'll stick to remembering Clarke Peters as Lester Freeman in The Wire.",2,1,2,29 June 2020
