Deja Vu," Its like spending 10 minutes to get to a cheesy punchline...
","I'm pretty disappointed how big and conspiracy-like it all seemed at the start and how by the end it turns out that everything was caused by some stupid redneck..And honestly... That villain was so poorly created. I don't know if it was the actors fault or the writers fault.... He didn't convince me... He didn't even have a REAL GOOD motive... they just made him sound crazy and went along with it..Big let down.The whole sci-fi element of this film annoyed me.. When the main character was asking how to use the computer... It felt like teaching a 70-year old how to send an email... I mean sheesh... How many times did they have to explain to us that they can't rewind? Only to have him ask again, then have him ask to have it rewound... as if it was for some dramatic effect.Terrible.Whats worse is that in the trailer I saw mentioned nothing about sci-fi... I mean I love sci-fi, but this was dumbed down to the point that it frustrated me... I was expecting maybe a spiritual/dramatic movie about a phenomenon and instead I got a magical computer and inconsistencies passed off as poetic license...",3,1,3,8 February 2007
