Skyfall," First half good, second half poor.
","I thought this Bond movie was going to be one of the best i've ever seen. Craig as ever, fits the role really well. Plenty of action and suspense from the very start with a good plot. BUT....after about an hour things start to go downhill. The end scene was one of the more disappointing that i've seen in a Bond film. M gets far too involved in this movie. Dench acts as Craig's side kick, getting into almost as much of the action as Bond himself does. Way over the top. Lets be realistic....would a high ranking middle class female civil servant based in Westminster really go around shooting guns at arch villains? M needs to get back into his/her office where they belong! Where was the beautiful Bond girl that Bond needed to protect in the final scene? The final scene has plenty of action but the scenario was corny! Worth a watch but you may at the end be a little disappointed!",5,17,34,7 November 2013
LÃ©on: The Professional," A Classic Film
","What makes this film so great? The actors! Reno, Portman and Oldman are brilliant grade A actors, and they really hit the jackpot with this film. When I first saw the movie I thought Portman must have been a young looking 14 or 15-year-old playing the part of a 12-year-old. I was wrong, she was a 12-year-old playing the part of a 12-year-old, which made her character even more realistic. Reno (Leon) and Portman (Mathilda) have a powerful dynamic relationship throughout the movie as a hit-man and orphan who are thrown together in an unlikely circumstance. Their characters are so believable and fascinating, by the end of the film it felt as if Leon and Mathilda were members of my own family because Reno's and Portman's performances was so gripping, realistic and heart felt. Portman is a complete natural talent, she doesn't act, she plays it for real! The soundtrack in the film also hits the right notes. Try holding back the tears at the end of the film when Sting sings 'shape of my heart'. This is a movie not to be missed!",10,1,1,6 November 2013
