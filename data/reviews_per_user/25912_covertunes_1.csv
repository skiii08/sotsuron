Hereditary," Don't waste your time
","Awful, awful, awful movie. Half ass story line, character development sucked. They apparently had a family dog that appeared for only two scenes and was suppose to have an impact but amounted to nothing more than who the hells dog is that? There were Naked old people zombies randomly appearing at the end. The audience was literally laughing at the 'scary' scenes and you could hear people cracking jokes all the way through the second half of the movie. The writers and director should be held accountable for false advertising. Don't waste your time with this movie.",1,170,352,9 June 2018
