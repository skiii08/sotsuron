The Avengers," I liked it because i like the people in it.
","RD Jr. is always good and sarcastically funny, Scarlett is always yummy and has all the moves, Hiddleston as Loki is great, I like that character. Then when Banner pounds the puss out of him into the floor 3x and punches Thor across the room, they were funny. The Hulk character has the potential for lots of funny bits. The evil dudes from the farside however fail to come off as even being interesting, a more human like enemy would have been better I think.I am DanielI am Sam Sam I amThat Sam-I-am That Sam-I-am!

Black Swan," So the princess from Nabu explores her darkside...
","I have to read other reviews because I have questions about what I saw vs. what I THINK I saw. Some imagery was meant to be Nina's subconscious concocting demons of it's own, I am not sure which of them were 'real' vs. her imagineering. I dug the film and it's uniqueness. It gives you a look into a very exclusive 'club' of NYC dancers and supermodels, these girls do exist and they're very screwy little prima donna's! Kunis.... SH|T.... her character gave me WOOD. That's the kinda chick all us guys always wanna hang with but can also be bitten by due to their streetwise attitude. I met a girl like that 2 summers ago: Labia piercings and a Nymphomaniac, I wanted to adopt her! When Cassel asks Nina if she's still a virgin.... YEAH, she did come off as such in her demure feminine persona. The plot of the story is all about Nina coming out of her shell, growing up and exploring her own sexuality... to the great dismay of mommy. Now I can relate to all of this because mine wanted me to stay a virgin forever and live at home, I ended that at age 22.My MAIN question about this film is this: I get that she actually stabbed herself rather than Kunis, but... is that ALSO concocted in her mind or did it actually happen within the story? Because for Nina to finish the rest of the opera, it's not possible to be stabbed in the stomach, flung in the air as a ballerina without losing blood and do two more acts... only to be laying on a mattress drenched in your own blood! What was fantasy vs. reality? Is it left to us to decide maybe? Ciao, bella!",8,0,2,23 March 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Worth seeing, good action and story.
","I was NOT going to see this but when I read Abrams wasn't involved, I reconsidered. A big improvement over his P.O.S. rehash from last year. Except: 1) They had the Calamari fish-face dude leading the attack, WHY? 2) They blew up another Porkins: Rehash! 3) Would have loved a bit more Vader and a scene with Palpatine also, seems to me too many subordinates were assuming command in the story. 4) Erso sends his daughter a hologram about putting a flaw in the Deathstar. Okay, well why not just send her the PLANS for the damn thing rather than Jan having to get get nuked on Bikini Island? Cause at that point, there are no 'wrong hands' the plans could fall into.Quick CGI cameo of Carrie Fisher at the end plus a return of all the 'New hope' pilots was a nice touch and allows this to slip right in chronologically between #3 and #4. Also James Earl Jones's voice is showing his age, you can hear it in the dialog. First thing I noticed was the absence of the opening text crawl.The CGI of Moff Tarkin seemed weirdly artificial to me and reused too many lines from 'New Hope' from 1978. 'You may fire when ready', way too much rehash! Forest Whitaker's character was good BUT the voicing was horrible! He sounded like his balls were in a vice every time he spoke, not good at all. Lastly, James Earl voicing Vader: NOT GOOD! I could hear the AGE in his voice as he spoke the few lines he did, it was noticeably OLDER than the powerful voice we'd all grown up with. Well, at least it wasn't Samuel Loudmouth Jackson!OH YEAH, the shield gate over Scarif: The last 2 ships that slammed into the shield, did they look like LEGO blocks to you too?",7,1,6,16 December 2016
The Intouchables," SEE IT! it's the proverbial sleeper you'll love.
","Even if it's on 123Movies.net, just take a look at it with the subtitles. Basically, Phillipe is totally paralyzed and decided rather than hiring another namby-pampy ass kisser for help, he'd try the ghetto black dude for a change of scenery and what a change he gets! The story unfolds shortly with one adventure after another and Driss has a knack for interjecting humor into every situation when possible, including fooling the cops into believing he was speeding Phil to the Emergency room instead of joy riding, whilst Phil was faking a seizure during the process. It ends well. Good stuff, a little on the 'gay.... feel good' side but the humorous episodes outweigh that. There is another good French flick too called Angel-A, also see that!",8,0,1,22 March 2017
Hidden Figures," Another one of those 'FEEL GOOD' movies for black folks!
","There were 3 subplots in this film which monopolized the viewer's attention, only ONE of them interested me.1) One girl had to run a half mile across the NASA campus to use the 'black ladies room'. Later in the movie, she exploded to Costner's character about it, he then tore the sign down from the wall preventing her from using the 'white ladies room' in their building. This subplot was okay and like the back-of-the-bus agenda of the 60's, drove the point home. 2) The subplot about the other girl getting cozy with the ex military guy before he finally proposed to her.... BORING and irrelevant. 3) The subplot about the third girl wanting to receive supervisor status at NASA and being discriminated against.... also irrelevant to the main story.This would be a GOOD rainy Sunday rental for you and your kids, just as LBJ would be (another Costner outing) but the MAIN plot of the story seemed lacking to me. For instance, HOW did the one woman teach herself FORTRAN programming and then instruct all the other women that language? Is that historical fact?",5,3,7,19 February 2017

Logan," X-Men goes hack-n-slash plus 4-letter language!
","Mostly kids/teens are wanting to see this and I really did not see any need for 4-letter expletives although I at 56 spew more filth than I care to admit... why would I want their generation following in my footsteps? 4-letter language has cost me several $75K (or higher) salaried I.T. jobs over the years, which didn't do my resume' nor my career much good. Seriously, you can RUIN your career just as well with 'F*ck' as you can with 'N*gger' or anything in between. Anyway...Patrick and Hugh did a nice job with this movie, the girl 'Laura' was adorable even in her animalistic temper tantrums. BUT it boils down to a pointless CGI hack-n-slash flick, the American public now being SO DUMBED DOWN, they can't see they're being sold trash. The public eats trash, so yeah, they're gonna watch trash too! I did not buy the premise that 1) A corporation is tromping around the USA with it's own private army and b) The clone of Wolverine would have been controllable instead of turning on its own handler. 3) After ALL the beatings he took, ya want me to BELIEVE a branch through the chest is what's going to end him? NAH.... STFU! Past efforts have been better, much better than this one.",5,3,9,17 March 2017
Joker," NO CGI or kiddy nonsense, just INCREDIBLE ACTING AND DRAMA!
","This is STRICTLY drama, finely presented by Phoenix. Not for kids, there's nothing in this for them (or the kid in any of us) but we're taken on a journey of a man's decent into his own darkness. Not all his fault or his doing. The disturbed parentage certainly didn't help matters.What was a departure from what we THOUGHT we knew was that the Wayne parents (according to this film) were killed by a copycat 'Joker', the protagonist of this film was unconscious on top of a squad car at the time. All the prior installments depict this man as the Wayne murderer, so you'll have to grapple with that lack of logic, I don't know what their purpose was for doing that.If you want to view some fine acting and a story with DEPTH, this would be good but kids will glean nothing from it, it's not for them. Note that they only spent $55M to make it and it's already nearing $1B income, now there's a positive switch! Personally, I'm sick of Marvel nonsense but it has it's place.What I would like to see are more installments and a history of 'Joker's' rise to power, how he acquires a crew, some of the jobs they do along the way and how they stay under the radar for ~30 years until the Batman comes on the scene. In this film, Joker meets young Bruce, entertaining him as the clown/magician he once was professionally, that was an interesting twist to the whole thing.",7,1,1,27 October 2019
Arrival," Well, it's far better than Annhilation but I would not have chosen Superman's GF.
","Take a look at 'Molly's Game' and see if Jessica Chastain wouldn't have been a fresher face to look at. Amy's just been around sci-fi too much.As for the plot of this film.... others said (and I agree) that the slow steady build-up of the story was good but I fail to see (I have an engineering and Unix Admin/computer background) how some new language is going to bring 'Peace on earth'? That's stretching it too far, IMHO.I'm going to watch it again today, see if it changes my mind this time. NOPE... knowing the future OR being able to glimpse fragments of future events is NOT a road to world peace. If anything, it would be perverted into a weapon for monetary or political gain. Understanding the meaning of ink blotches will in no way elevate man out of his animalistic predilections or superstitious beliefs. I'm a Christian and even I don't believe HALF the nonsense they buy into.",7,0,2,6 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," It did WELL because the prior SW movie was a decade ago!
","Nobody REALLY cares about my opinion. Anyway....First off, I'm pro-Star Wars, in that I saw New Hope in the late 70's as a teen when dad took me to it, then went into my parents basement for MONTHS with his 8mm movie camera to make stop-motion films using the X-wing/Tie/Falcon models produced at the time by MPC. Star Wars serves one very important function between my generation and pre-teens and that's a common ground for bonding. So it's a Godsend for parents trying to reach their kids with something FUN that can be shared 'round the dinner table, IF in fact the proverbial 'dinner table' still exists in America, I tend to doubt it. My folks grew up in the midst of the Great Depression, you cooked your own meals and food was never thrown out because some douchebag was anorexic! 'Gluten free', 'Lactose intolerant' or 'peanut allergies' would have been laughed into the street. But I digress...I wanna have Daisy Ridley's babies! HOW did they find an almost identical clone of Keira Knightly? Look, I'm a BIG fan of heroine flicks and reveled in scenes from 'Kick Ass' and 'Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'.... you know damn well when these Hollywood types are not shooting these things.... they are indeed watching each others work for new ideas. It's a known fact the crew is grossly enamored with Doctor Who also. One thing that anyone would notice the last few years was the uprising of lady heroes in films, all the way back to Tarantino's 'Death Proof' in Grindhouse! Thus, they came up with Rey.SMART.Finn was well played and cast, however... This '1st order' is commanded by the DUMBEST space Nazi's in the universe, it seems to me a 'space minority' would be hard to come by, working for these twits! He is however a typical black male, needing constant pushing by his peers to get his ass in gear! I liked the character though, he's amicable.SMART.Ford was needed as the 'older mentor' and played his part brilliantly, with touches of 'shoot from the hip' sarcasm from 'Cowboys vs. Aliens' In this film, Ford was the ONLY choice for this spot. He ushered the new kids into the rebel agenda.VERY SMART.Kylo Ren is a giant momma's boy who killed daddy but got whooped by a girl without training? HOW could that even happen?STUPID.In baseball, THREE strikes and you're out. I refer to the THIRD iteration of a huge destructive THING which must be destroyed by our heroes. The only question is.... how STUPID are space Nazi's anyway? Where did they get their subprime mortgage from, Bank of America? WHO is buying these 'Deathstar bonds' to finance this stupidity, Sand people? Has ANYONE in Hollywood noticed how ISIS operates? As a 1 man suicide bomber, NOT as a disguised planet! Third laser moon? STUPID. (NO..... UNBELIEVABLY RIDICULOUS!)At the tail end of the story, we get the face-to-face between Ridley and Hamill, NO words are exchanged... fade to the credits. The next film will open with her Jedi training, probably right there on the cliffs overlooking the ocean. A beautiful shot, by the way! Luke is obviously slated for Star Wars 8 as the new 'Yoda' mentor and it would not surprise me if in the next film, he starts imitating Yoda's voice in front of Rey. At which point, Yoda makes a mystical appearance in front of the two. Depending on how this is shot, it may be... SMART? (Or are we doing Dagobah again?)JJ Abrams is a c-u-n-t riding on the coat tails of his predecessors and if you couldn't notice in 'Star Trek into Darkness' the obvious faux pas of stealing substance (and actual lines!) from 'Wrath of Kahn', you may have been too stoned on the chemicals in the popcorn! I have NO respect for that kid. IF you can't see the obvious act of stealing from stories that were done ~30 years ago, then you're a c-u-n-t too! I didn't come here to make onlne friends, so TOUGH TITTY, as my mom used to say! I sat through the closing credits and noticed about 400 names for digital artists. During the 18 trailers we were made to sit through, I noticed ALL upcoming films are either CGI or animated. They've got a winner in Daisy Ridley. But lose JJ Abrams, I don't see him as a truly creative 'force' in moviedom.Nobody REALLY cares about my opinion. Anyway....",5,2,7,18 December 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," When he's not drunk and getting anti-Semitic...
","Mel can make a good flick! When he wants to, no high fives for the Road Warrior series, nope. I watched this online, so now I gotta go to Redbox and give him the $1.62 it deserves. The story was excellent, the visuals were gory but necessary for this particular tale. I found the underground network of tunnels interesting since I had read about those but never saw them. 75 guys were taken off that ridge by the one medic, that's an impressive feat and at the end, they did several short interviews of the real-life people from these events. I also notice since Mel built a church on his property, he tends to give God more of a spotlight in his films now, thus the Bible and Christian belief are featured in this film. Cheers",8,7,11,2 March 2017
