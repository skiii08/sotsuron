Catch Me If You Can," Wonderful!
","I am so surprised!!  I just got back from seeing Catch Me, and I wasn't expecting much from it.  I think this one has Oscar written all over it for Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio, and maybe even Steven Spielberg.
The storytelling and layout of the film was outstanding.  To start with an easily recognizable game show (To Tell the Truth), and to take the movie as many places it did shows that Spielberg has not lost his touch.  He needed to direct a winner after so many draws, and he did with this one.  In the words of Frank Abagnale himself: 'You know why the Yankees always win the World Series?  It's because of the pinstripes.'  The pinstripes really wowwed me!Oh, and I LOVED the soundtrack.  This is one to bring home and listen to over and over again.",10,1,2,20 January 2003
