The Ring," what happned after they got samara out of the well
","SPOILER ALERT alright, i understand most of the movie, but there are bits that just dont make any sense at all! like Noah's assistant at the end of the movie, my guess is it'll be explained in the sequel. anyhow, after rachel got Samara out of the well, they arranged for her body to be have a proper burial, Rachel thought it was over. Until Aidan points to her that Samara doesnt want to be helped, all she wants is to hurt other people as she had  said earlier in that tape from the psychiatric, so rachel tries to warn Noah but he doesnt answer his phone, and later Samara kills him, so Rachel becomes confused as to why she was spared and realizes the only way to avoid death is by making a copy of the tape so that more people can get to see it, and she makes Aidan make a copy himself.. i just have one question: what did richard morgan mean when he said: she (anna morgan) wasnt supposed to have a child???!!!",Null,0,0,27 April 2003
