The Ring," Scary film that utilizes wonderful techniques
","I had high expectations for this movie and they were fulfilled.  The trailer itself represented what the film would be: a montage of dark, creepy, dreadful events filmed and portrayed in a dark, creepy, dreadful way. The fact that a videotape kills people a week after they watch it is not what makes this film scary; if that were so then the ridiculous Feardotcom would have also been scary. The Ring is scary because of the way it is filmed and presented. As others have said, there is a feeling of dread constantly present and as the plot unravels, the dread takes over you until finally when Samara emerges with climactic terror you realize exactly why Verbinski wanted you to feel so much dread. I saw this movie the first time in a packed theater and the second time in a less-than-half-full crowded, and obviously the first time my experience was enhanced.  The second time allowed me to go back and review things I didn't notice the first time, such as the reason victims scribble out faces of people in pictures with a black pen is to represent Samara and her black hair covering her face after being in the well; and the reason the horse on the boat went crazy is because it was nearing Moesko Island, where all horses were put on a spell by Samara to drown themselves.  I noticed other little things that made the movie seem that much better.  Naomi Watts's superb acting, as well as good supporting acting by Martin Henderson, is extremely successful. Cast is important; someone like, say Keanu Reeves, for the role of Noah would have been disastrous. Kudos also to Rick Baker for creating a horrifying appearance for Samara's victims.While I've yet to see Ringu (I have to find a place where I can order it) and therefore cannot compare the two, I admit that The Ring is a fantastic film and contains everything I look for in a true horror film.  The lack of blood and guts and special effects and men running around with ghost masks and steak knives, and the ability for Verbinski to scare audiences with just plot, acting, camerawork, lighting, editing, and direction is what makes this one of my favorite horror films. Soon I will see Nakata's version and will be able to truly appreciate it all. But for now, I rate The Ring ten out of ten.",Null,0,0,31 October 2002
Saving Private Ryan," Great film, but not the best...
","As well as giving a brief review of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, I would also like to give a little bit of the history behind it. Granted, I have not read all 1300+ of the previous reviews that are already here as I begin to type, but I did read one review that I feel I must correct. Somebody said that the film was loosely based on the Sullivans, who were five brothers from Waterloo, Iowa who all died when their ship, the Juneau, was torpedoed off Guadalcanal in November 1942.  This person was misinformed.  The Sullivans were indeed real men who died in the PTO of the war, and were even mentioned in 'Saving Private Ryan' (their deaths were the reason that the four Ryan boys were supposedly split up into different units), but the story was in no way based on them. It is, however, loosely based on the Niland brothers. The real Private Ryan was Sergeant Fritz Niland of the 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment (P.I.R.). He is mentioned in Stephen Ambrose's novel 'Band of Brothers' as a friend of Donald Malarkey's and Warren 'Skip' Muck's (played by Scott Grimes and Richard Speight Jr., respectively, in the HBO miniseries.) Shortly after D-Day, Sergeant Niland learned that his brother Bob had been killed. Bob was part of the 82nd Airborne, which was another regiment that jumped behind enemy lines in the early hours of D-Day. Niland then discovered that another brother, who had been a platoon leader in the 4th Infantry Division, had been killed at Utah Beach. When he returned to his company, a fellow soldier was looking for Niland to tell him that his third and final brother had been killed in the China-Burma-India theater, and that he was supposed to be sent home immediately -- and he was.  No secret search mission. No babysitting bridges. No defying orders. However, like Private Ryan, he did return home to a mother who had recently received death notices for three of her  sons. There might be some spoilers here, I guess.  Nothing that ruins the ending of the film, though. Saving Private Ryan's realism is undoubtedly one of the best when it comes to war films (I think 'Band of Brothers' outdid it, though... then again that came three years later.) The opening D-Day sequence is spectacular, and it really gave the sense of what it was like to be there. Random moments stuck in my head much after the movie had progressed into its search for Ryan ('These're all we've got between us and the Almighty!' --referring to the cross-steel objects that had been placed on the beach by the Germans in order to rip apart landing crafts on a high tide but actually worked to the advantage of the invading Americans;  Captain Miller's (Hanks) shouting 'tell Shore Party this, tell Shore Party that!' only to find out that the radio man had a giant hole puncturing his face and that the radio was busted;  one soldier getting shot in the helmet and Private Caparzo (Vin Diesel) saying 'Lucky b*****d,' then the soldier takes off his helmet and is shot in the head; and of course, the terrifying 'Mama!' screams.) All of these elements, plus the incredible special effects, sounds, realistic-looking beach and amazing costumes make the scene one of the best combat sequences ever filmed.  I really did feel like I was there. The rest of the movie went downhill. The first time I saw it, I thought the whole movie was fantastic, but on later viewings (the seventh, the eighth... the twelfth, the thirteenth...  yes, that many) I realized I didn't like it as much as I originally thought I did.  Captain Miller and seven men, who are undoubtedly part of the stereotypical combat squad (the hick sharpshooter, the Italian guy, the Jew, the worried guy, the annoying guy everyone hates, the brave Sarge, and the medic who is more concerned about the safety of others than the safety of himself) are sent on a mission to rescue Private James Ryan who has lost three brothers within a week and is to be sent home immediately. Ryan jumped into Normandy with the 506th P.I.R., part of the 101st Airborne (the same Airborne our friends of Easy Company in 'Band of Brothers' are in), but he's been misdropped and is lost somewhere behind enemy lines... as were about half of the men dropped into Normandy early on D-Day.  Misdrops were everywhere.  Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore) calls the mission 'finding a needle in a haystack' and Miller corrects him, 'It's like finding a needle in a stack of needles.' The rest of the movie is fantastic in realistically portraying the horrors of war, and the acting is superb by every actor who commits themselves to a role. The actors portray a bunch of World War II Army Rangers as accurately as they can. Much of this is probably thanks to Captain Dale Dye, who put them through a boot camp before the movie began shooting. Dye makes a brief appearance as the War Department Colonel in the beginning of the film (and for 'Band of Brothers,' which he also helped with to transform actors into soldiers, he had a much larger role as Colonel Robert Sink, and does a great job representing him.) However, as I watched it more and more, the plot grew weak and boring for me. That's something I never thought I'd admit, but I'm admitting it now. I guess I like things of this measure to have actually happened, such as Band of Brothers actually happened... I don't know, it's something about eight guys wondering through all of France to find one guy that begins to disturb me now. I can't put my finger on why. Oh well.  It's still a great film, but simply not the best... Check out The Thin Red Line for a more philosophical approach and Band of Brothers for a brilliant approach to real events and real characters.

Enemy at the Gates," Nope...sorry
","ENEMY AT THE GATES kept me interested, don't get me wrong. But there is one thing about movies, especially war movies, especially war movies based on a true event, that just gets to me, and it starts drilling into my brain, making me shift uncomfortably in my seat as I watch.  The lack of realism. This movie contains plenty of that.The opening sequence... magnificent. I was expecting a brilliant movie to follow. And what's sad is that it could have been. The story that 'Enemy at the Gates' is based on is intriguing, a great aspect of a war that recently has only been told about from the American point of view. Vassili (Jude Law) grew up hunting, thus explaining his remarkable ability to handle a sniper rifle in the war. He becomes a valuable weapon to the Red Army, which has been suffering from overwhelming defeats and from low morale. Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), a soldier who is also in charge of a Russian newspaper, begins spreading the word of Vassili's talent throughout the army, making him a superhero to the depressed soldiers.  Major Konig (Ed Harris) of the German Army, also an accomplished sniper, is sent to eliminate Vasilli.The sniper scenes between the two are very well-done, but my question is, where are the rest of the people? I have a very hard time believing that Vassili and Konig were the only two people in the entire city of Stalingrad at this time. Where is the rest of the Red Army stationed there? Where is the rest of the German Army? It is not only one street that is silent... it is the whole city. Vassili and Konig are basically wandering throughout the entire city just looking for each other. Here and there someone will pop up, but it's not believable. Just that lowers my opinion of the film.I also don't understand the position of Danilov. In the beginning, when Vassili first finds him, he is a young, terrified soldier hiding amongst dead bodies, afraid to shoot a weapon, and then later he is a powerful officer running his own newspaper. The transition was too sudden, too unrealistic. One minute he's just an average guy and the next he's this bigshot with much influence. Didn't like it.And the accents... oh man, the accents. I understand that director Jean-Jacques Annaud was possibly trying to make it easier for the audience to understand, but this was just ridiculous. Jude Law and Joseph Fiennes, both portraying Russian soldiers, didn't even attempt to change their British accents to adapt to their roles. And Ed Harris... well that is the most American-sounding German soldier I have ever seen. I would rather not be able to understand a few lines in the movie because of realistic accents than have no accents at all.The scenes... they ended too abruptly. One scene Vassili is in a building carefully being watched by Konig and a few others... the very next scene he's safe in someone's home. One scene two Russian soldiers are in a building where a German sniper is waiting... one dies, and in the next scene the other is safely at home. No. Didn't like.And Konig's relationship with the boy. Horrible. 'Don't leave home or I'll have to kill you.'  Boy leaves home, Konig simply kills him with no resistance from the boy. But Konig just doesn't shoot him... he hangs him off a high pole in the middle of the city. Again, where are the rest of the people as this happens? The boy is hanged so high up... surely someone would see him and Konig as it was happening.And, like someone else here said, if Konig could find Vassili so easily, why did he need a sniper rifle? Why couldn't he just take a grenade or a bazooka or a mine or some other explosive and just get it over with? All the tension? Sure, I understand that in real life it really was a sniper fight, not a bazooka fight, but it just gets ridiculous after a while.And the sex scene! It was entirely unnecessary, and entirely too long! It just went on and on and on... and on! I thought it would never end. I had to ask myself if the movie had taken on a new focus. I wasn't sure. No... no... no...As an entertaining film, it's alright. As a realistic historical film, which it is supposed to be, it's not alright.ENEMY AT THE GATES - 2/10",Null,1,2,6 November 2001
Signs," Theist Propaganda
","That's all it is.  Theist propaganda.  I felt cheated that the sci-fi story about aliens and crop circles was just a gimmick in order to tell a tale about a man's revival in his belief in god.  As soon as I found out that Gibson was an ex-reverend who became an atheist after his wife's tragic demise, I immediately knew that the rest of the film would somehow relate to his struggle to regain his relationship with his god through another tragic event, this one being an alien attack.  This was not a movie about aliens. It was not a movie about UFOs or armageddon.  It was a cheap way to ask the question, 'do you believe in god or not?' and then answers itself at the end with, 'you'd better.' I was disgusted.Other than that chief complaint, I did not find the movie to be terrible. It was suspenseful and often a bit scary, although it did not bring forth many new ideas. I thought the buildup was good because it left everything up to the imagination, that is until the aliens were seen.  I thought the aliens were cheesy looking and not frightening. In Independence Day, the aliens terrified me. In this movie, I thought of a Halloween costume I once wore. 5/10.",Null,2,3,5 August 2002
The Matrix," So overrated it makes me sick
","I did not enjoy this film.  Yes, I enjoyed the special effects, which were beyond superb, but it takes more than special effects to get me to enjoy a movie.  When the Matrix was released, these effects were amazing, something brand new and outrageous, but now they are nothing unusual and when you take away that aspect of the film, you get nothing.  You get a stupid, uninteresting plot and a cast of terrible actors, minus Laurence Fishburne. Not that the actors are terrible, just their acting in this movie is terrible. Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano both prove they can act in Memento, but here they just flop. And I can't believe that Keanu Reeves gets cast for any movies because he is just plain miserable, one of the worst actors ever to enter the business.  Plot and acting are two things I look for ahead of special effects in a movie. I can enjoy a movie that has absolutely no special effects whatsoever and was filmed with an amateur home video camera, as long as the plot and acting are good.  This movie, with a huge budget, wasted all of it on special effects and none of it on teaching the actors how to act or paying the Wachowski's to improve the script and to learn how to direct. Such a stupid movie, and I can't figure out why it is so popular.  Because it was the first to introduce such effects?  Does that mean one must automatically love the original, just because it was the first? The Matterhorn Mountain at Disneyland was the first roller coaster to introduce steel tubular track, but is it my favorite steel roller coaster?  No. Coca-Cola was released before Pepsi-Cola, but is Coke my favorite soft drink?  No.  So why must this movie be everyone's favorite just because it was the first to introduce these visual effects?  I don't know and won't know.  The only answer I ever hear from people as to why they loved this movie is 'Well didn't you see the special effects?'  Screw the special effects.  Give me Memento, a movie with virtually no special effects.  Give me Field of Dreams.  Philadelphia.  Even My Dog Skip.Matrix - 2/10 (for Fishburne, whose appearances were the only decent ones).",Null,2,4,7 August 2002
The Thin Red Line," Extremely underrated
","There is so much negativity towards this beautiful film that it makes me cringe. Released shortly after Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan,' many people seemed to think that THE THIN RED LINE was a 'ripoff' of the former. Yeah, that's something I really heard someone tell me. A ripoff.  Even though the two were in production at the same time and dealt with totally different topics (the only similarities being that they both were about soldiers in World War II), people called The Thin Red Line a ripoff. Unbelievable.And if it really is a ripoff (which it isn't... I still laugh thinking about referring to it as that), what an incredible ripoff... I must say.The people who didn't like this movie didn't like it because it was ingenious. It is based on an ingenious novel of the same title by James Jones (which I have read, it's fantastic), and of course it can't compare to the book, because few movies can. People have blasted Terrence Malick on his adaptation, and while I admit many parts are different than the book, many parts that should have been included were left out, and some were poorly recreated, the film on a whole is brilliant.The World War II generation was not afraid to fight, is what I've read. But the World War II generation is not every single man... of course there were those who were afraid, those who didn't want to fight. No matter how small a percentage these kinds of men were (and I'm sure that what I've read doesn't lie, I'm sure it really was a small percentage) they did exist. And this film shows it.  There is Private Witt, who goes AWOL in order to avoid fighting. There is Corporal Fife, who's so scared he can't even stand still. There's Private Doll, who's eager to kill a 'Jap' but when he finally does begins to regret killing a human being. There's Private Bead, the young guy, whose death is one of the most emotional in the entire film. There's Captain Staros (Stein in the book... I still can't figure out why they changed that for the movie) who has become so close to his men that he is afraid to follow any order that might get too many of them killed.
But then of course there's those characters who remind us of what the other kinds of men were like. There is Sergeant Welsh, who knows he's got a job to do and does it without hesitation. There's Lieutenant Colonel Fife, who orders something and expects it to be followed no matter what. There's Captain Gaff, eager to fight but also concerned about the health of his men. There's Sergeant Storm, who stands in the middle of a field at night screaming, 'Why don't you shoot me? Come and get me!'So many different characters, and while a lot of people think the voiceovers were lame and corny, I actually think they blended those characters together very nicely. The battle scenes were well-paced and althought the movie was slow at some points, I never found it to be boring. It was disappointing how George Clooney and John Travolta were advertised as main stars and each was in it for about thirty seconds.I love this film. And the book.THE THIN RED LINE - 10/10",Null,1,4,6 November 2001
