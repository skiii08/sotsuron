Howl's Moving Castle," Loved it!
","I saw the movie in Japanese and loved it. I liked the visuals and the story. I bought the book after seeing it and - I might be in the minority here - I didn't like it as much as the movie. While not bad at all I couldn't relate to any of the characters of the book, I found Sophie annoying and closed-minded and Howl's character was quite one dimensional imo. I prefer the movie which I think does a wonderful job in taking some of the original ideas of the book and creating a new and wonderful story even if it doesn't follow the book. I also think the characters in the movie are much more likable. I would still recommend seeing/reading both the move and the book.",10,5,8,11 June 2005
