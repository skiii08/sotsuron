Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Mind Bending Spectacular Delight to Mind
","I believe it would be unfair to compare the original Sherlock Holmes in the book compared to what's being painted on the silver screen by director Guy Richie. Though the represented personalities differ a lot in their approach, but the underlying characters remains the same. Both Solve Cases !!We had studied many stories of Sherlock Holmes in school which was very boring since Sherlock Holmes was just too Classic and Sober. Thus with the same thought saw this adaptation and I was quite impressed with the first part, it made a a fan of Sherlock Holmes by Guy Richie.The best part of part 2 lies in how the part 1 is extended in all its forms of Action, Thrill and lots of Mind Bending logic. Guy Richie gets his camera works on the spot by mixing thoughts and actions into a very interesting situation which treats eyes and mind. The movie makes you think and learn how dots can be connected to form a picture.I would understate my thoughts if i said i loved Robert Downey Jr, He seems to have made a unique identity for Sherlock Holmes with the kind of portrayal. Hats off to him.I missed this on the big screen but caught it on DVD and couldn't help put my views.",9,1,2,21 April 2012
