The Hangover," Extremely FamiliarTerritory
","I am baffled by the high user ratings. How many movies have involved a group of guys (a bachelor party specifically) going to Vegas? What new ideas did this present besides the chronological gimmick?Just thinking about it now, this movie was very similar to the Simpsons episode wherein Homer and Flanders go to Las Vegas. It was also somewhat like a subplot of Knocked Up, etc.But the bigger problems are, as another post here says, is that it did not really make sense, and worst of all, what was so funny about it? I can think of but a single bit that elicited an outright laugh and maybe a couple of other things that made me smile, but that's about it.",4,1,3,8 August 2009
I Am Legend," A Very Effective Horror Flic
","I have read the book and seen the two prior versions. What I would say is that without much in the way of surprises, the movie includes details that are quite interesting if not nearly fully explored.But the strongest aspect of I Am Legend is its achievement of a consistent level of suspense: it literally had me and others I spoke with on the edge of their seats.Not a movie for kids, thought it could have been rated R.Semi-Spoiler: This version was not faithful to the book; The Last Man is close but as another reviewer mentioned, the Vincent Price flick is really cheaply made. But what one who knows the original story suspects is that they were coming close to the central idea of Matheson's work, that maybe the script writers had this in mind and were over-ruled? That they used the Matheson title is an indication of this.",8,1,3,22 December 2007
