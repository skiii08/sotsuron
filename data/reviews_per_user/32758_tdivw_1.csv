Source Code," beyond ridiculous
","I like sci-fi but sorry this is far-fetched crap. The premise is utterly absurd. The whole concept and story is like swiss cheese, full of holes. You might enjoy this movie if you are the type who doesn't think much and takes everything presented on the evening news as absolute and unquestionable fact. This movie is also laced with the following recurring messages we are bombarded with daily:The government loves you and wants to save you from any harm. Any who question the government are 'anti-government' terrorists. Now clean cut boy next door looking white guys are the terrorists. The government always does the right thing in the end. Condensed version of review:To be fair, the acting and execution are excellent. The scientific premise is not even remotely believable and the film is cheaply themed with pro government, pro military over the top terroristic fear perpetuating crap.",1,38,75,7 August 2011
