Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Surprisingly Good
","Went into this not expecting much from it but from the start was given a full on vampire action/thriller. The film could have been set over a couple of days and been a standard action film but setting it over a lifetime gave the picture much more depth by displaying youth and arrogance and then watching lincoln grow older and wiser made the film as good as it is. The supporting characters were good if lacking background. The plot was explained well with few flaws. What really surprised me was simply how it looked. It looks absolutely epic(mainly the scene where he cuts the tree down), the train scene was particularly well done showing drama and action in the same scene. Truly one of the best films of the year.",9,2,4,26 October 2012
