Hereditary," Masterly crafted !
","If you liked the Witch, Psycho, or The Shining ,do youself a favor and watch ' Hereditary ' It is that good,
The director bring us slowly but very surely a very very unsettling and creepy atmosphere with an even more disturbing ending.A must see !",10,2,5,15 September 2019
Alien: Covenant," The real victim here is intelligence....
","Many people said it before me, and in better English, that 'thing' is a disgrace to Alien (so was Prometheus). 2 hours of complete illogical decisions and non sense from the crew. Do yourself a favor and give your hard earned money to filmmakers who don't think the public is dumb.",1,5,7,11 October 2017
