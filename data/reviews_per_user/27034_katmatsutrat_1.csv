Requiem for a Dream," Symbolism
","Requiem for a dream is a film about addiction, the balance and use of images and music is very well used in this film. Even more special, and even beautiful , is the hidden symbolism in this movie.The symbolism is hidden within the seasons. At first you have 'summer' , everything is beautiful , happy , sunny and positive. Just like the summer is , everything is full of life and the 'good' side of drugs is represented. Then comes 'autumn' the tide turns. The dark side of drug use comes forward. The characters' lives go down in a spiral of negative emotions. Even worse is 'winter' because the extremely horrible , but maybe also inevitable , climax comes forwards. Their lives are worth nothing. But isn't their any hope when 'spring' the season of birth and awakening is yet to come ? This even comes more forward when all characters lay down in fetus position. It even looks like they are ready to be reborn.I just want to say that this is my favorite movie. And I really suggest you go see it at once!",10,1,2,1 February 2006
