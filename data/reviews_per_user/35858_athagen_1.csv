The Expendables 2," Why don't they make more movies like this!
","Action, action fun.. Van Damme as a villain works fantastic. Braindead maybe but still it's just great. This is a film you know what you are getting, and it does not disappoint. Great scenes and lot's of funny one liners. I laughed and smiled most of the time, you just got to take the movie for what it is. Plain action comedy, and it delivers. To bad Jet Li didn't have a bigger role but still, the rest just made magic. I wish i could see Jean-Claude Van Damme in more movies. He's raw as an villain. The setting's and effects are very good, this screams high budget and nothing looks like it's been cut back. Over all, this is a guy's movie night dream come true.",8,2,6,20 August 2012
