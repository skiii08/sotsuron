The Blair Witch Project," Morons willingly run into a scary forest and toss common sense away
","I give this film a pass (just 5) because it managed to scare me (at a purely psychological level) towards the end. But the sheer stupidity of the characters is simply impossible to swallow: one of them throws the map, which in their situation is like a parachutist throwing his parachute. And, worst, when they are walking in circles, they don't think that they could just follow the river, which by the laws of physics flows downward and therefore would lead them somewhere. They could follow the river downwards, until they arrive to the sea or to civilization, or upwards, until they reach a high point from which they could see their surroundings. There's no excuse to walk in circles when there's a river in sight.I admit that the shot of the upper half of the actress' face is pretty effective, but an inspired shot does not a good film make.Pair this with 'Mindhunters' and watch both if you think that the 'play' button is at the same time the 'turn off' button for your brain. If not, watch 'The Shining' instead.",5,0,3,21 August 2007
Memento," Crippled mind/narrative in search of its own identity... Wow!
","***Warning: Major spoilers ahead***An original idea cleverly executed!I don't want to dwell in the analysis of facts and coherence: the last images of 'Memento' (or where they the first ones?) leave few possible, coherent or logical explanations, as we see Lenny's tattoos when his wife is still alive: was the character of Jorja Fox his second wife, and then whatever became of her? Did he kill her? Or perhaps his only wife survived the attack and Lenny's tattooed himself to create a puzzle and distract himself from the tragedy of memory loss...Too complicated. Lenny's amnesia could be simulated, and in fact sometimes he seems to forget to play the amnesic (what an irony!). This would explain a lot. But, like in 'The Prestige', do we really need an explanation? What if the illusion is more interesting? In fact, Nolan has set us up with false memories and a puzzle where the search for coherence is the McGuffin that drives another search: that of meaning for our lives, identity for ourselves, and all those little daily routines or sentimental rituals that define us. What makes you who you are? Your car? Your dress? Your money? Your home? Your hotel? Your job? Your restaurant? Your disease? Your actions? Your friends? Your lovers? Your family? Your lies? Your crimes? Your death? Your memory?The presence of two 'Matrix' actors (Moss and Pantoliano, the girl and the villain) is an interesting coincidence. Both films are about invented or fictitious lives: one created from inside the person, and the other crafted from outside the individual.After 'Memento', I'm interested in everything Nolan has done or will do in the future: even if he films a three hour prequel to 'My stepmother is an alien', I will watch it with enthusiasm: I know that he will turn it into something interesting. He already did that in 'Batman Begins'.Unforgettable memento of the unlimited possibilities of cinema.10 out of 10 for Christopher Nolan, and also for John Nolan (author of the narration that inspired the film).",10,1,3,20 June 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," Greengrass' ultimatum + Happy Birthday Great Actress Joan Allen
","***Spoilers ahead!*** Greengrass' ultimatum to action movies: get a brain, my movies have it.And stamina, of course. In fact, most other action movies seem so silly when compared to the Bourne series that even the James Bond franchise openly imitates it in the last two films (the ones with Daniel Craig).Both Bourne's physical skills and intelligence are realistically portrayed, which is very refreshing, specially the portrayal of his wit: his logic and his tricks are so simple that they convince you. You and me could eventually figure out things or invent tricks like Bourne does, only that he thinks much faster than us. But his 'mental stunts' are always reasonable: you understand them, which makes the film much more effective (it would work even with much less action, thanks to intrigue).By the way, Happy Birthday Joan Allen (great, classy actress, beautiful and elegant). Pamela Landy adds another touch of realism: if you look in the real world, you will see super-professional women just like her. Perhaps Bournes do not exist, but Pam Landys certainly do.The trademark (and landmark) fight sequences reach their top in the series (one of the aspects imitated by recent Bond films) and Julia Styles' Nikki is there to stare in disbelief as Bourne battles his hardest adversary. The close up on the face of this very fine actress (excellent Desdemona in 'Hamlet 2000') is much more shocking than, for example, showing the bloody corpse of the deceased killer.Original and bold plot move, placing the last scene of 'The Bourne Supremacy' in the middle of 'Ultimatum' (of course they are the same scene, in spite of minor differences!), thus playing with the viewer's memory.This time the car chases, another trademark, become self-consciously over the top and almost self-parody, with Bourne getting a police car and taking more risks than ever.Awesome final confrontation in the buildings of the secret agencies, with Bourne and Landy communicating by subtle hints they are sending each other.I can't hardly wait to see 'The Bourne Legacy'.",10,2,4,20 August 2009
21," Stylish 'life experience'
","***Spoilers ahead***Many people pinpoint plot holes as if they were very smart, or as if the plot holes were very obvious, and I think they don't realize films need not to be taken too literally. In fact, the obviousness itself can be a signal to the clever viewer, telling her/him that she/he is being presented with a metaphor, a narrative license, an excuse to be stylish, or simply a joke. Why are they going always to the same casino? Because it represents all casinos, and Larry Fishburne is a symbol for all security guards: the filmmakers chose an arena for the struggle, and a character to be the antagonist. Why are their gestures so obvious? In the first place because they are being clearly shown... of course, it's a film. And also because Jill is very, very sexy crossing her arms like that (and we also expect some 'glamour' in a film that happens to happen in Las Vegas). If the director had chosen to tell with painstaking detail all the shifts from one casino to another, from one gesture to another, then instead of plot-hole hunters we would have the other kind of people who always complain about films being confusing. Film narrative should be clear. If your attention span is high, then you can entertain yourself catching the tiny little bits of information that the filmmakers let there for us between one scene and the following. And the board discussion about the first and last scene reminds me a similar one about 'The Bourne ultimatum'. Please! Cinema is a symbolic art. So: those discussions are pointless. Of course they were the same scene, in spite of the obvious differences in clothing, etc., because they were the same at a symbolic level, and that's what counts. The book is just the inspiration for an atmospheric thriller with a sexy bias, which is in fact the kind of film we all love, and '21' is a nice, stylish and well conceived one. If you are interested in the mathematics of BlackJack, or want precise instructions to beat a casino, look elsewhere.",8,0,1,7 January 2009
North by Northwest," Ultraperfect synthesis of romantic comedy and metaphysical thriller
","Until the 50s millions of elegant romantic comedies were produced, with tons of wit that screenplays seem to lack ever since. Since the 60s, millions of action thrillers have been produced, with tons of high octane fuel we can even get tired of. And in between, namely in 1959, Hitchcock placed the more than perfect merging of the two genres.The ultimate blueprint for lighthearted adventure, with subtle metaphysical overtones such as identity without existence, overlapping layers of lie, truth and ambiguity, and not only one but two consecutive enigmatic endings, one in a stylish house (with a climax where the hero is mostly off screen, while we hear gunshots that are not even real fire, as we know later in a quite humorous way) and the other with the backdrop of the presidents' giant faces, epitomizing the whole film: a meaningless pursuit under cold, great powers that largely surpass the characters.But even against this stone-cold backdrop there is place for a real cliffhanger and some romance, concluding with a funny visual metaphor... Summing up, Hitchcock at his best. I prefer this playful Hitchcock over the solemn ('Vertigo', 'Torn curtain') or scary one ('Psycho', 'The Birds') although his films always have an humorous undercurrent, again lacking in most contemporary films, that provides a necessary distance between both sides of the screen: too many films today pretend to be serious and real (in a shallow sense, of course).A 200% perfect film, with an unforgettable Cary Grant and the beautiful Eva Marie Saint, top class villains James Mason and Martin Landau, elegant title sequence and extraordinarily thrilling music by Bernard Herrmann.10 out of 10. You can endlessly dwell in this genuine encyclopedia of the adventure genre.",10,0,2,15 July 2007
Batman Begins," Is batman a Nolan archetype?
","What I enjoyed most in 'Batman Begins' was its effort to be realistic: Batman's suit is made of a special material, whose properties are realistically described and portrayed. His car does things we have seen in TV shows and in footage from real car chases: realism is more important than speed in this car and in the film itself.But don't be fooled: Nolan does not try to convince us that a 'batman' could exist thanks to a strong will, intensive training and modern technology. Realism is just the perfect guideline to make a fiction more complex, deeper, and more interesting to analyze (if you want to), with a richer texture and many details that you can pick on second viewing.This batman does not live in our universe, but at least his universe is almost as complex as our own, and not that oversimplification of the previous batman films. Nolan creates an interesting atmosphere, as he does in his other films, and brings back his usual obsessions on identity, the illusions of mind and the actions that define us.And after all... in what film do you hear someone talking about 'jungian archetypes'? Another touch of realism and a psychological joke, something you could expect from the director of 'Memento'.9 out of 10. I can't wait to see 'The Dark Knight'.",9,1,1,20 June 2007
The Dark Knight," The metaphysics of plot twist is back!
","I think all that discussion about this film's greatness or lack thereof is irrelevant. Nolan has proved that he is a true original, and the question is: has he directed a truly Nolan film? Somewhere in the middle of the film I was worried that he had failed... How could I lose my faith? Then a major plot twist occurs, then another and I realize that the Nolan team is in excellent shape. I had overlooked the clever preparation of the plot twists: once they happen, the exposition of Nolan themes soon follows, enforced by the testosterone of a very exciting action film, and his themes are identity, ethics and the actions that define us. And a great metalinguistic sub-theme, a Nolan's favorite: the philosophy of plot twist, of the tightly woven screenplay, of plots within plots within plots... plots and counter-plots that escalate in the wit matching between extraordinary adversaries, between mind titans, and eventually between good and evil themselves. If evil has no self-imposed limitations, and good by definition does... how could good prevail? You can find some answers in this film... and some of them are really dark.",10,3,8,13 September 2008
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Let Francis Ford Dracula fascinate you: your neck will not regret it
","Brilliant inspiration by Francis Ford Coppola, and a delightful homage to the beginnings of cinema (Lumière, Mélies). Besides, it is a 100% romantic film, much more than a horror film. Traditional visual FX and modern make up FX merge effortlessly and very successfully, the photography is excellent and the production design spectacular. Wonderful costumes by Eiko Ishioka, some of them barely seen. Incredible music by Woiciek Kilar for an incredibly atmospheric movie.Enjoyable Anthony Hopkins as cynical Van Helsing, and Gary Oldman as charming Dracula: a clever transposition of sympathies. There is abundance of cultural references to art history (the Gorgon, oriental art, paintings, 19th century gardens...) and to the time in which Stoker's novel is set (e.g. Van Helsing saying something about electromagnetic fields, then the state of the art in science, cinema itself and, interestingly, Mina naming Mme. Curie).There are so many details to discover, that you can watch this film again and again.10 out of 10. Almost every frame is beautiful like a painting.",10,3,5,21 July 2007
Blade Runner," The best metaphysical thriller since 'North by Northwest', but much darker.
","Underneath the spectacular and somehow sad shots of the futuristic urban landscape, deep and disquieting questions are creeping: Are my memories real? Are they my own? And if not, who am I? Was I born, or created with a banal purpose? Is my disappearance preestablished even since before my existence? Will every thought be lost? Not only my thoughts, but all of them? How do we price life?The eye concentrates all 'Blade Runner' simbology: consciousness, conscience, and the unconscious, the faking of emotions, identity, sadness facing an unfriendly future, and the killing of creators: in fact, the murder of aspiring deities. That postmodern Prometheus named Eldon Tyrell could have thought better than creating cold-hearted creatures: his demise at the hands of one of his creations (after an almost incestuous kiss) is coherent in a film obsessed with eyes.Unforgettable scene when Pris, created to be a living sexual doll, but with a mind of her own that grants her the ability to suffer, is hiding among genuine mindless dolls. And then there is the lyric aspect of the film: a sensible romance and wonderful music, and of course that final monologue just before the last mortal replicant releases his soul (symbolized, in a very classical way, by a bird).All this is present in both versions of the film, but the director's cut is better, more noir, more conclusive, and with a richer layering: in the commercial cut, Gaff's little figures (besides their symbolism of Deckard's situation) only serve a minor revelation, namely that Gaff had been at Deckard's home and let Rachel live, while in the director's cut the (now absolutely necessary) unicorn dream sequence turns this into a major revelation, because Deckard's intimate thoughts are known by Gaff, which means Deckard is a replicant.Ridley Scott has never equaled himself, not even in 'Thelma and Louise' or 'Gladiator', and the merit of his co-workers can not be overlooked: Hampton Fancher and David Peoples as screenwriters, composer Vangelis, designer Syd Mead, FX wizard Douglas Trumbull, etc.Not to forget Philip K. Dick's inherently philosophical literature, much of whose anticipation will continually catch us in the next years, as unfearful scientists begin to play with the possibility of creating artificial minds: beware of your offsprings!10 out of 10 for Ridley Scott and all the rest, and perhaps for a masterpiece that, in a certain sense, created itself at the right time.",10,1,2,15 July 2007
Casino Royale," Bond uses a cell phone just like yours instead of lighting cigarettes with Q's mini-flamethrower
","Among the best Bonds, thanks to Martin Campbell's expert direction and Daniel Craig effortlessly fitting in the wardrobe of his predecessors.Besides the good balance between realism and acrobatic action, this Bond succeeds in avoiding a frequent mistake of the previous ones: the excess of gadgetry, now wisely turned into abundance of multimedia technology that we are all familiar with (well, the embellishments in the geographic search were very cool but perhaps a little too much).Less gadgetry means less Q or R (none is seen in this film) and, thankfully enough, more M played by that wonderful and distinguished actress, Judi Dench, whose presence alone puts any film in the top class.Good chemistry (more believable than usual) between Craig and extremely beautiful Eva Green, who delivers a multi-layered performance much above the usual needs of Bond films but very welcome in this one.Plus an excellent villain and spectacular highlights that don't diminish the rest of the film: in fact, there is a good amount of intrigue that does not need to be fueled by gunshots but is sustained by sheer interest and anticipation, as in the best suspense films.8 out of 10 for the film, 10 out of 10 for the cast (and please, bring back the villains that survived: Mathis, Mr. White...) I had never been so satisfied to read in the end credits that 'James Bond will return'.",8,2,11,8 July 2007
