The Blair Witch Project," Original, but failed my expectations
","I saw this movie with my brother, I showed him all the reviews I could find so that he thought this movie was worth $9 student admission. How wrong I was! If there's a 'Most Wasted Popcorn Award ', I would nominate The Blair Witch Project. After I walked out of the theater, we could barely walk. All the movements of the camera in the film made me sick, not to mention how horribly BAD the movie itself is. Come on, all those stories in the horror movies doesn't really exist! They are just like that-movie. And when you mix it with total reality, it doesn't work. If they shot a few more glimpses of the witch, it might be better. All the made -up things in it is just ridiculous. This IS original, but it's not scary at all (or at least, not a bit scarier than any other horror movies). This creativity should be put somewhere else, not on the big screen. If you want good horror, don't waste your time and money on this movie . You'll be totally disappointed if you do, and possibly getting a terrible headache like I did.",1,1,3,11 April 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I fell asleep in the middle of it...
","So little Anakin is cute. Queen Amidala is cool. Jar Jar Binks is stupid. And the race was really good- but still couldn't keep me awake after that.I returned the video, unfinished, and I don't think I'll ever want to. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life.",6,0,1,6 June 2000
Erin Brockovich," Very Pretty!
","With that cleavage, Erin Brockovich is still more of a a girls' movie. Julia Roberts is the sassy, foul-mouthed mother of three, who can tell that her her daughter havn't gone to bed without even looking. This is one role that really proves she can be more than a 'film star' and makes people think she IS an actress-a very good one, indeed..The story itself is really great and it's real, so that just makes it even more convincing!Congratulations also to the co-stars, who did such a wonderful work and really supports Julia's role. It has lots of humour, but isn't shallow at all-this maybe what I call a 'serious comedy'.Erin Brockovich is moving, funny, smart and sassy.I'd give it 9.5/10 (the half taken off for excess bad language). If you feel you are in need of some Girl Power, buy a ticket and see this movie.Just don't be too excited to swear all the way home~~",10,1,1,5 May 2000
Batman Returns," Too weird to be good
","But then again, it IS a fantasy movie, so it's not bad. Visually it is quite nice but I would prefer a better 'do for Christopher Walken, although it makes him look like a bad guy. The leads Micheal Keaton, Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeiffer are great, and in my personal opinion, Keaton is much better than George Clooney. Make-up and a fake nose does wonders for DeVito, and so does a catsuit for Pfeiffer, who looks absolutely stunning doing cartwheels in that slinky little number! The idea of the umbrellas are really freaky but cute at the same time. Where does the duck come from, anyway?? Tim Burton is really good with these kind of stuff and I wouldn't say this was a bad movie but it was obviously cartoonish. Burton's Sleepy Hollow was a much better film, but that's another matter. If only they didn't make any more sequels...",6,1,2,14 November 2000
X-Men," This movie doesn't deserve a rating more than 7.5
","Blame it on the media or whatever, but I REALLY looked forward to see this movie. I even bought a $13 US movie magazine just because it featured it before it even came out here. If I didn't have such HIGH expectations, it might seem better. But I walked out of the cinema feeling a little ripped off. And here's why: 1. It is so damn short! How could they do this to a huge blockbuster? It should have been between 120~150 minutes, but not merely 104 minutes! The story is way too much to be told in less than two hours. This fault is forgivable, at least they are making sequels. 2. I know I shouldn't really say this, since I've never heard of The X-Men comics before, but I think the movie might have worked better with even fewer main characters: look at Batman and Robin. Enough said. 3. Bad, bad acting! Okay, just Storm, no-one else. I have to mention, 50% of my intention to see this movie was seeing Halle Berry donning a white wig. Too bad I didn't realize HOW was she bad. She was so wooden and her 'woodenness' probably won't be so noticeable if she wasn't so damn beautiful.That's it, really....I'm quite impressed with Anna Paquin and I could really relate to her situation, not in 'that' way, of course. And Hugh Jackman and Famke Janssen were really pleasant surprises, too. Ah...I'll never forgot the naked Mr Jackman! ( he should be with Rogue, IMHO)Now that I think about it more, it's just a little more than average with good visuals which proves to make the fans smile. I'd love to see a more active (and sexy!) Rogue in the sequels. The studio should have allowed Bryan Singer more time, and I think it was the main reason why this movie was incoherent in places and looks hastily made. Still I look forward to sequels and I hope by then, they'll make something that lives up to my expectations.",8,0,0,14 November 2000
10 Things I Hate About You," One of the best 'teen' movies ever!
","This movie that established Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger is great! Right from the start to finish, it always keeps me very awake (and that is a good thing 'cause movies are supposed to be entertaining)! The jokes are so funny and clever, too--something not easy to do. The only mildly offensive reference is Kat's comment to the size of Joey's er, package. Not only the two young leads really shine in this movie, the adults are the even funnier ones! Ms. Perky (now that's a good name!) and Mr. Stratford has some of the best lines like, 'My insurance does not cover PMS!' and '...and hell is only a sauna.' The ditzy airhead little sis of Kat, Bianca, is also played well by Larisa Oleynik. As annoying as Kat sees her, she's still a likable little girl and boy, can she punch! Basically is this a flick for teenage girls...of course guys can appreciate it too, but be warned, there are some very embarrassing moments. The fact that it was adopted from a Shakespeare play doesn't hurt it at all. okay, they perhaps should delete those strange little Shakespearean quotes, cause it doesn't fit in very well. I haven't read the play ('The Taming of the Shrew') so I don't know how the original story goes, but 10 Things I Hate About You is definitely a refreshing update and I'm sure Shakespeare didn't include the flashing bit (haha)! To top that off, this movie also has a fantastic soundtrack , so many great songs that they couldn't cram it all on the actual soundtrack, so go rent the movie. My personal favorite songs are 'I Want You to Want Me' and 'Can't Get Enough of You' but there are a lot of other hip songs--go look for it's 'Sountrack Listings' for full details.I really loved this movie and I give it 8/10.",8,0,0,19 January 2001
American Pie," Be prepared to laugh your head off!!
","I rented this video out of curiosity ,and for Alyson, too. Anyway, my friends thought it was good. I read those reviews on this movie and I thought,'Sounds cool!' Only that I wasn't 16 yet. So I waited for the video. It's generally good, some really gross-out scenes and weird and wonderful ideas(I'm referring to the pie scene...)But I didn't pay too much attention to the characters( except Michelle, maybe) because too bad I rented it along with The Matrix and saw it the morning after, when I was still in the shadow of T M's glory. This is not the kind of movie your parents would like, so avoid watching it with them. One piece of great advice we got from the movie: always lock the door!!",7,0,0,5 May 2000
American Beauty," Beautiful but not THAT great
","This is a good movie, but I don't think it was as great as some people said(or insisted?). It looks closely at the 'dirt' underneath what seems like a peaceful and normal situation. The premise of the story is hardly original, a middle-aged man wanting to have a life, but with his trouble family: super bitch wife Carolyn and estranged daughter, Jane, plus his lust for the temptress Angela, things got pretty ugly at the end.
What amazed me is that, they could make a great film out of this story. 'Beauty' is a extremely dark comedy, with some of the wittiest dialogue I've heard: 'honey, you didn't screw up once!' still cracks me up! It's really moving, too. Sometimes it can be scary to see the truth going on out there, other times it's just plain pathetic (sex obsessed cheerleader, anyone?) Visually it's a treat, too...who could forget the dancing plastic bag? Or Mena Suvari lying naked in a bed of roses?I cannot fault a single performance. Spacey and Bening were absolutely 'believable', while the young supporting casts get a well deserved big break for them. Congratulations especially to Thora Birch, who portrayed Jane wonderfully. This movie deserved it's Oscars, and I think it got enough. Like I said, it's pretty good but not great. It's not for everyone, but worth your money. A quote from Birch: ' I don't know why American audiences responded to it so much. It's such a harsh reflection on themselves.' Now I do agree with that.",7,0,0,5 August 2000
Mission: Impossible II," OK story. And DID it go the way I thought it would!
","WARNING: SPOILER!!!First thing: this is an action movie. You know, guns, motorcycle chases, big (and repetitive) car explosions and the like. The story line is not bad actually, and I enjoyed it, left the cinema feeling entertained. The actors did a good job and I had no problem with that (but still, watching Tom in action mode makes me laugh!)After closer inspection, you'll notice that this movie has a lot of flaws...but I am not going there. The thing is, it is way TOO predictable. And this makes it less exciting. I mean come on! They won't possibly let Tom Cruise die like he was an idiot, would they? The whole part where Ethan got caught and unable to speak is just too ridiculous. Who would believe THAT was the real Ethan? So he's not. And he got killed by the villain. I'm not going to say who the poor bastard is, but his little finger got chopped off. And you'll KNOW who that is.Overall it's not a bad Saturday night movie, but do not have high expectations, you might end up hating it if you do.",7,0,0,21 July 2000
The Matrix," Even if you think you might hate it....(a bit of spoiler)
","Okay, I'm not going to say too much on this movie because most people already said what I'm about to say. The Matrix is one truly AMAZING movie!! It's really clever because it CAN be possible (although, it is only a movie...) I mean, how do you know if what you see, touch, feel or smell is real or not? Very few times have I been in love with a movie when I only saw it on video, but in this case, yes. Not to mention I nearly killed myself for not seeing it on the big screen, or at least rent it earlier....What I didn't know is, The Matrix is a great action/sci-fi(and I thought I hated this genre) , with great casts and visual FX and so on. I guess it's the poster that really turned me off. Keanu Reeves is quite good as (cute, except when he's hairless)  Neo, and Carrie-Anne Moss is equally good, providing she doesn't have as much experience and not very well-known. She was great as Trinity, and I think she really should be given more credit than just 'Keanu Reeves' co-star' !The Matrix is unique in it's way. It has violence but we don't see more than 10mls of blood. Instead, we only see a lot of bullets. Personally I think the scene where Tank loads thousands of guns is pretty cool, but the lobby scene is a bit excessive, and the kiss scene is really weird( how come Neo can be resurrected after he's dead in the REAL world?? )but overall this is pretty good...every time you see it. It just lingers in your head for ages after you've seen it. So, if you are still wondering what The Matrix is, RENT THE VIDEO! You won't regret it, even if you think you might hate it...at least you'll know what the fuss is all about. Then you'll decide for yourself if The Matrix deserves #30 in the world's best movies.'Unfortunately, no-one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself.'",10,0,0,29 April 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The beginning of my favorite movie trilogy
","But not my favorite movie, which is still The Matrix, but it comes very, very close, and in some ways this even surpasses The Matrix. For example the opening scene and the theme music (Da-da, da-la-da, da-da...). It's fantastic old-fashioned entertainment that after more than twenty years, still manages to make a teenager of the 21st century very happy : )The most amazing thing about the movie is the simplicity of the story -- it's so simple it can be summed up in just one sentence: farm boy rescues princess and saves the day. And then George Lucas threw in lots of action with special effects--I don't really mind that they are outdated--plus humor and romance into a cheesy script actually capable of holding it all together without going over the top: how genius is that?Some people may say that it's just a kids' movie, but it's one hell of a kids' movie! Although the beginning was a bit slow, everything afterwards is full of tension and excitement. Spacecrafts! Explosions! More spacecrafts and loads and loads of Imperial Stormtroopers in white armors, blasting at our heroes and heroine! And between the howling and blasting, comic reliefs are inserted which produce an odd but pleasant effect. There are severed arms and laser weapons for the boys, big bun hairdo and romantic moments for the girls (but beware: watch the whole trilogy and when you think back, some become rather disturbing moments. You'll see what I mean.) , and all of the above for the grownups. Parents don't have to worry about violence and/or sex-- it has a perfect PG rating. Whether you are nine years young or nine hundred years old like Master Yoda, you can always enjoy the wondrous space spectacular and the colorful characters who lead us through it.
Speaking of characters--which I think, besides the story, is the most important aspect of a film--I loved all of them! Especially Princess Leia and Darth Vader (the sound of heavy breathing will never be the same! ). And I thought the casting was perfect too. There are also lots of weird and wonderful creatures who are not only interesting to look at, they all possess some distinctive quirkiness which makes them, well, alien, while C-3PO and R2-D2 made the funniest pair of robots I've seen! Returning to our kind, Mr. Vader was *the* perfect villain in black; Leia is super-cool for a princess, and Han the 'stuck-up, half-witted, scruffy-looking nerve-herder' gave some extra edge to the movie. And last but definitely not least, Luke Skywalker. Luke is not the conventional hero, but I don't care that some people think he's just a whiny kid, come on, he's only human! And he gets my sympathy. Most people should be able to find something in what Luke goes through to related to. This and the religious undertone of the Force should be reason enough to put 'Star Wars' under the definition of 'universal appeal' in your dictionary.And of course there's the legendary lightsaber...who doesn't know about the lightsaber? It's so famous that I knew about it even before I heard about the movie itself. The lightsabers, along with the X-wing fighters, the AT-AT walkers (in 'Empire') and the Death Star are involved in some of the most visually stunning sequences in the trilogy. The floating sandspeeder and the little lightsaber training ball still bring a smile to my face and I'm sure that they will do that for my children as well, just as they did to the children twenty years ago.To be honest, this is a pretty mediocre film, and I agree that it has been praised and worshiped to some ridiculous degree, but it does have so much more than your other 'average' movies. It's a classic Good vs. Evil story wrapped in modern special effect, it has hi-tech inventions and interesting characters who are surprisingly believable, but most of all it was that extraordinary sense of fun that has swept me to that galaxy far, far away. Every time it feels like a new adventure, and I cannot recall many movies which has done that for me. It's like...magic. If you have already seen it, there's no harm in seeing it again. If you haven't, you know you have the guarantee of millions of fans worldwide, but you need to experience it to decide for yourself. All I have to say before you do is: it won't disappoint you.May the Force be with Star Wars forever!",9,0,0,26 October 2001
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," wow....
","This is not the best film ever, but vampires have never looked so good!!Brad Pitt looks a bit odd, though, and I reckon a short 'do suits him better.Tom Cruise portrays the evil one perfectly, and it's nice to see the very young Kirsten Dunst. She is SO adorable!!Acting is generally good, the story is just okay...not very innovative.All the eating scenes were quite disgusting( not the scenes itself, but the cries of the victims)But this is just another movie which (kinda...) proves that Brad Pitt always does these not-so-hot movies.",7,0,1,5 May 2000
Gladiator," Frighteningly beautiful
","This is one of the best movies ,and the first Roman-epic-kind movie I have ever seen. It is powerful, the story superb and the lion scenes reduced me to a weeny cat. Incredibly stylish with computer-generated graphics, it did not look very convincing but-I know it may sound strange-in a way it adds to the intensity of the film, so CG served it's purpose. Who said violence had to look totally realistic?The story and sword-fighting aside, I found the acting is just as good. Russell Crowe delivers the emotions very well...the best I'm-very-p***ed-off-right-now face I've seen! And Joaquin Phoenix also did an excellent job. He looked like he was born with the evil glint in his eyes. Very, Very good.This movie is breathtaking. Go see it once or twice, you won't regret it.",9,1,1,21 July 2000
