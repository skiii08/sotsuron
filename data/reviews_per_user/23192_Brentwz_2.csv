Men in Black 3," Excellent all over again! Now we've got MIB 1, 2 & 3...
","We enjoyed it To-The-Max! Each of the 3 movies has been different enough in concept storyline that they happily stand alone, or hang out together as humorous, serious, scifi fantasy with a bit of love interest too.What a paradoxical monster mash of fun, folks.And the subtle one-liners; gotta get the DVD ASAP & rewatch. It's a sad person indeed who can't/won't/didn't get the mostest out of this brilliant entertainment time machine MIB III.Thanks to all who did the hard yards to bring Will, Tommy, Josh, Emma, Jemaine to our Sunshine Coast big screen!",10,7,13,22 July 2012
The Fifth Element," Excellent! One of my all-time favourites...
","Did I say, 'One of my all-time favourites?' Well, I meant it, 'Was, Now & Ever Shall Be!' Anything more has already been said, other than we've got the 2-DVD Special Edition version & on the movie Disk 1, if you ever get bored rewatching The Fifth Element, choose the Fact Track menu option.Sweet! Not only does it add lots of actually interesting trivia to the film from Credits onwards, but it also forces a whole new level of attention span to what you think you've seen before.You just never know where or when the trivia text will appear on screen & so your eyes will reappraise peripheral viewpoints all over again.Fresh & new, yeah. Excellent... always.",Null,2,4,2 March 2013
