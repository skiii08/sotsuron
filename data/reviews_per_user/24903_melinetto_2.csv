The Hangover," get ready to have some laughs
","It's one of the most hilarious movies i've ever seen. I laughed so hard and had extremely fun for the entire movie. And you know, some people can say that there were 'too many below the belt jokes (such as; Alan's joke with the baby)' and which is true. But four guys go to Las Vegas for the bachelor party. Actually, what would you expect other than this?
They woke up in the next morning, none of them can remember a thing and realize that the groom is missing. Alan, Phil and Stu try to find Doug who is the groom-to be.
It can say that all of the things that happen to them is incredibly farcical. I think that's the reason makes it so funny. There's a well-written screenplay and by the leading of Zach Galifianakis, Ed Helms and Bradley Cooper have great chemistry and they are really funny. Zach Galifianakis is extremely hilarious for the entire movie and he fits the character.
Personally, i can say that i love it very much. The genre is comedy and all and usually, it can make lower the expectations somehow about the quality of the movie. But i think that it is the one of the most amazing examples of the genre.
I can recommend to the people who love to laugh. And also this movie presents Bradley Cooper to the world as a fine actor completely.",8,0,1,27 April 2020
Marriage Story," perfect acting all over the place
","Even though the title of the film is 'Marriage Story' but that's ironic 'cause Noah Baumbach tells a story about divorce. In another words, it can be said craving for love or longing for the past.
First of all, there are some incredible performances, just terrific. The best performance of Scarlett Johansson i've ever seen. She plays the character of Nicole so perfectly. And Adam Driver is so amazing aswell. I think that he will perform just like this one in different films in the future. The actors who plays the secondary characters make the best of their roles. Laura Dern, who i always think that she's an amazing actress, is just perfect. Ray Liotta who plays Jay Marotta who is an ambitious and successful lawyer performs very well in spite of the short screen time.
I've read and heard various comments about the movie. Although the story is seemed by the perspective of Charlie i think that's an objective point of view from the director. As a matter of fact, i've read that Noah Baumbach writes the story about his own experiences. In fact, he sent the script to his ex-wife Jennifer Jason-Leigh and she loves it. In this regard, it can be said that there's some auto-biographical feature in this film. Because of that, maybe the writer is on 'Charlie's side' a little bit but as i said, i think that the movie is impartial. So, i think that the audiences understand completely why Nicole wants a divorce and why Nicole can't have self-fulfillment in that marriage.
There are a lot of scenes that are memorable. For example, the beginning sequence, the scene that Nicole opens up Nora, the scene that the monologue of Laura Dern about 'the mother is always perfect', the scene which is Adam Driver sings 'Being Alive' that's the excellent piece of Stephen Sondheim, the scenes with the halloween and Charlie's loneliness, the scene that Charlie talks on the phone with Nora and exits the theater and finds himself in crowded street of NYC, the scene that Nicole and Charlie face off and Charlie shows the burst of emotion, the scene that Charlie reads Nicole's letter with his son Henry and many more...
Frankly, the movie is very well directed and written and the actors are so amazing but i've seen some excessive comments how perfect the film is. I can't quite understand what the fuss is all about even though i like it and i think that it's a quality one.",7,1,1,5 July 2020
