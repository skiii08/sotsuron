Mission: Impossible III," Exciting movie,much better than II
","IMDb:6.9/10
I think it should be rated much higher. It can be over 7.5 because this movie has a few touching scenes and many exciting action scenes and funny scenes. I think it is enough to be call 'A mega hit spy-action movie'. You can enjoy this with your family,girlfriend,boyfriend,friends or even alone.",8,1,1,8 August 2018
Chinatown," My first fill noir.
",This is the first film noir movie I've ever watched. The tendency of today's movie is action and sometimes thriller. I hope a lot of movies like this aremade again.,8,0,0,15 September 2018
Wind River," Really good suspense-human drama
",The way of showing the past scene (the door scene) is really good. The story is good. The camera angles are good. This is a masterpiece.,9,0,0,18 August 2018
The Prestige," The prestige.
",The time line makes this movie good. The tricks are made perfectly and cannot be understood by us. But at the last scene we all know the tricks. The desire for the revenge makes them crazy.,9,2,4,7 August 2018
The Hateful Eight," Long. Good.
","Most movies start when this movie pasts 1 hour. I don't like scenes that show us the past suddenly like '10 years ago' but this movie has 6 chapters and we know that because we know Quentin Tarantino has created this movie. Therefore, I could enjoy this long long movie without being bored but excited.",8,0,1,17 August 2018
Fargo," Great.
","I love Coen brothers' movies. This story is based on a true story and the story is just a story. Because the way of describing it is great,this movie is great. It could be a serious movie but,certainly,it is serious but not so serious . There are some comedy scenes so I felt the 98 minuets passed very quickly like a moment. It's fascinating.",8,0,0,5 August 2018
The Revenant," A spectacular revenge
","Great movie. Glass just crawls to revenge Fitzgerald. He has few foods but he just lives on to revenge Fitzgerald. That's all he can do. In my opinion,this movie is about a man who loses everything and decides to live just to revenge and a man who is selfish and each of the men's faith to the God.",10,0,1,3 August 2018
American Psycho," Difficult to understand.
",People think all about themselves. They are indifferent to other people. Therefore people in this movie often mistake people's names and don't care who Patrick kills or what he did or what he's talking.,7,0,0,3 September 2018
American Beauty," Beauties. Brutalities. Hypocrisies.
",A man who doesn't get along with his family is attracted by his daughter's fried and he feels as if he revived from death. And finally he finds a beauty. Everyone has agonies.,8,0,1,12 August 2018
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," This series gets better as it progresses.
","Since Christopher McQuarrie has become the director,Mission Impossible has got cooler. Mission Impossible I And II are not spy movies. J.J Abrams' and Christopher McQuarrie's are spy movies. I'm looking forward to watching Fall Out.",8,1,1,11 August 2018
Collateral," Hmmm. Not bad.
",Hmmm. Not bad. Not good. But I was a bit boring while I was watching it.,7,1,4,14 August 2018
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Not bad.
",I like III better. This story is totally a bit boring. And this series doesn't explain what IMF really is. I want to know more about it.,7,0,1,9 August 2018
Gone Girl," Strange film (which means the film is good.)
",The movies are beautiful like The Social Network. David Finches's good job. The story is good and interesting but not great.,8,1,2,17 September 2018
Dog Day Afternoon," Good ending.
",The story is not what I expected to be and it's neither good nor bad. The ending is good.,7,0,3,20 September 2018
Gran Torino," He decides not to commit a sin again and sacrifice his life to give the kid a new life.
","This movie is about a man who commutes a sin before and a kid whose life has just begun. Walt decides to protect the kid even if it costs his life.
I like the description of the time course of the friendship between Walt and Thao.",8,0,0,4 August 2018
The Dark Knight," Masterpiece
",The action scenes are very realistic and great. Gordon's last words makes me tremble with emotion.,9,0,1,16 August 2018
Sicario," Taylor Sheridan is one of the greatest screenwriters in the world.
","Very realistic. Exciting but a bit boring. I'm looking forward to seeing The Day of Soldado. In my opinion,Wind River is really good. It's better than Hell or High Wartsr. And Hell or High Warter is better than Sicario. What I'm sure to say is that Taylor Sheridan is one of the greatest screenwriters in the world.",7,0,0,19 August 2018
The Shawshank Redemption," I can't express this movie in words.
","There are a lot of movies that tell us something important. But this movie is different from those. If we put all movies on one line,this one can't be put on it. We all should see this movie at least once in our lives.",9,0,0,6 August 2018
The Dark Knight Rises," Great.
",Great. Perfect. It touched my heart. It goes without saying that this movie is one of the greatest ones in the world.,10,1,3,9 September 2018
Heat," One of the best movies of all the time.
","Some people say this movie takes too much time to show the conclusion,which is predictable. As for me,that opinion is nothing. Everything about this movie is perfect. The time length makes this movie great. It's spectacular. The action scenes are great. The characters are great. The way of showing them is great. This movie is worth watching over and over. One of the best movies I've ever seen.",10,11,15,28 October 2018
