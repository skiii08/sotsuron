Skyfall," Overrated, as most of today's movies
","I really do not understand why so many people praise this movie. Maybe that's marketing. 'Skyfall' is generally very bad. The greatest failure in this film is about character of James Bond. Bond as we remember is charismatic, charming... This movie shows him as a very serious, even depressed. If no one mentions his name in movie, no one would even know it's James Bond.Hacking computers in the movie is something most stupid as can be seen, really offends human intelligence, as well as many other parts.Today it seems that a lot of the criteria have changed, and so we have a very bad movies with good rating.",2,6,13,31 December 2012
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Excellent movie, but unfortunately underrated
","After a while I realized that rating do not matter at all - this movie is underrated. Greatest role is marketing and placing the film on the market (and advertising), after which people no longer think for themselves. Funny, but it really is true. Today we have a lot of bad movies that are highly rated (example: Man of steel, Skyfall, Pirates of Caribbean - even my kid gaper while watching pirates ... Iron man etc.). Well, this film is better (and underrated).I will not compare this movie with the video game, but only as movie, regardless of video games. Prince of Persia is fantastic movie with great story. It was fun, had a lot of action, acting was nice, great CGI and suitable for all age groups. Those people who rated this movie low are mainly fans of video game. They will probably give a better rating to a movie like Skyfall only because it is covered by better marketing and more advertised. I think it is about time that people start to use their head, instead of the media bomb.After all, I recommend this movie. Watch it, will give you a great entertainment.",9,0,0,25 December 2013
Man of Steel," Very bad version of Superman
","I can not understand people who liked this movie. What they see here? Man of Steel is a movie full of effects, explosions, and nothing more. Completely sterile and without spirit. Good movie is not about the special effects. There are a lot of inconsistencies in this story, that's not normal and affecting the intelligence of people. Character and personality Superman has changed. Superman does not appear in this film...this version does not exist in the comics or in earlier versions of films. Can be 'Man of Steel', but it's not Superman. Superman never kills. Everything has changed: how Superman gets his suit, how he get his powers and how adapts to conditions on Earth, how he let people die not trying to help them. The film shows the explosions, special effects but not supermen as is. In this movie, Superman just kills without problems, leaving others to perish, not trying to save them. Human view of Superman should be 'faith in humanity restored', but not 'Superman, go kill them all and destroy everything'.Superman should be a role model to humans, not some killing machine that destroys everything in its path. By far the dumbest version of the film. Do not fall on the special effects and do not 'let the computer to act' rather than actors while good stories left behind. I saw the bad versions of Batman and other superheroes, but this is totally ruined...",1,9,18,26 June 2013
Joker," Slow and boring
","First 50 reviews are like: 'best movie ever', 'masterpiece', 'legend'. And you know what? 99% of these comments (and other 10/10 comments) are paid comments or from microworkers. Real rating for this movie would be 4.5 up to 5. Every single person who watched this movie in cinema told me that movie is boring and nothing special. Only on the internet you can see fake reviews as part of their marketing.
Joker in this movie is nothing like real Joker we know. I mean acting is good, but writting is bad.
He was dissapointed in society, nobody pay attention to him, so he start crying, dancing and killing. That's literally all in this movie. Cringe every second minute. And movie is sloooow to the bones...
Ratings are totally irrelevant because fake reviews are part of the movie.",2,13,27,10 November 2019
