The Devil's Advocate," Best one I ever saw!
","If there's a vote from 1-10, this one should get 12! Al Pacino is king of the world in this movie. His act is so good it just can't be better. I saw this one 5 times and I'm still not tired of it. There is also a montage (probably computer) that takes your breath away. And of course...a shocking turnover at the end (remember seven or primal fear?) that makes a big smile on your face!",10,1,1,11 March 1999
Meet Joe Black," The greatest story of live & love ever told!
","It's truly beautifull! The cast is powerfull and so is their role playing. Two realy important things, that are life & love, joined together into one incredible movie. It is long, unforgetable, once in a lifetime movie (and I'm a guy who likes to watch thrillers  :))  )! You oughta see this one!",10,0,0,12 November 1999
Event Horizon," Greatest Horror/Sci-Fi I've ever seen!
","This is the greatest Horror/Sci-Fi mixture there is! If you love great effects, scary story, great acting and horror backed up with great directing,...this is it! It's about the lost ship called EVENT HORIZON lost in space in 2040. Seven years later a rescue team goes after them on top secret mission.Once the rescue crew arrives at Neptune the scary moments begin. I'm not into telling more, because I don't want to spoil the moment of watching it. Remember scary horror scenes in 7 (se7en)??? Well,... multiply it by 10 and add Hellraiser to get scenes from this one. Please, avoid this movie if you're having a problem with nightmares, other wise...enjoy it!",10,0,4,23 July 1999
