Scarface," THE BEST!!
",Scarface is the best movie ever made! There will never be another movie like it. This movie alone makes Pacino the best actor EVER! Regardless. Tell me who is a better actor and why. The reason that Scarface is the best movie ever is that it represents a realness of life for someone like Tony Montana at that time. It is a story of the little man building himself up to be the big man. *SPOILER*Tony's death expresses the realism of his life choices. The question is: Are we supposed to feel for Tony or look at him as 'the bad guy' that got what was coming to him?,10,6,13,19 November 2004
