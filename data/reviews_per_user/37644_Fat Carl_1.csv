Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Juvenile
","Not much difference between this and a Disney movie. The comic relief went waaaaay overboard, pretty much destroying the movie. Not only was it out of place, it was terribly unfunny. It was almost sickening to hear the audience laugh nervously, feeling obligated to appreciate Lucas' abysmal attempts at humor.There were obvious concessions to eight-year-olds who would have had a hard time understanding parts. It has the trademark silly and clumsy characters right out of Disney movies, the strong and serious lead, and the obvious good versus the obvious evil. No shades of gray here. It's all spelled out for you and the kiddies.'The Phantom Menace' is a shallow, juvenile movie overall. Save your money for 'Eyes Wide Shut.' Or go rent a Truffaut film. For God's sake, spend eight dollars and two hours any way you can instead of seeing this movie. It's boring, predictable, and overwrought with juvenility.",2,0,1,21 May 1999
