Kill Bill: Vol. 2," True Tarantino
","Tarantino, a man that could be nick-named the Human Roller-coaster, does perfectly what every other director struggles to do. He takes you on a ride, and leaves you wanting more. And he does not sell the viewer a bid of goods and expects them to be satisfied. He makes sure that every detail in the movie is brought out and nothing contradicts itself. His genius spills out even to the music in his films. I dare someone to go into this movie and pick out something that is not a tribute to something. Tarantino is at the top of his game in this film and no one could ever think that he is going to decline in his movie making glory. If you think that this movie is a bust with lack of plot and substance, you obviously no nothing about the history of Hollywood movies. Tarantino has nowhere else to go but up.",Null,0,1,12 September 2004
