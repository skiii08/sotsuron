The Longest Yard," A cheap prostitute dressed in fancy clothes
","What a waste of perfectly good film! How Adam Sandler continues to get funding for his projects is beyond me. Extremely poor, story and character development, lousy casting and predictable ending (and I don't mean by who won).This movie was no homage. It was nothing more than a cheap prostitute dressed in fancy clothes. A remake of the classic, edgy, well-developed, dramatic original, that was laced with intelligent humor and good acting. I couldn't believe the crap they were trying to sell the audience. To start with, the poor choice of location for the prison. In the New Mexico dessert? 'C'mon.' Didn't I see a ghost town tour bus in the background? And what's with the century old prison with 2-year-old, apparent, freshly planted trees? And what's with the movie's southern undertones; like the warden's completely out of place Colonel Sander's sidekick, and the guards who are referred to as 'Rednecks?' Are we in the South or the West? Give me a break guys. Totally ridiculous. Oh, and how about the stadium where they play this Superbowl in? Glad ESPN was there to cover the game to give it that... oh so authentic feel.Hey Burt! You were great in the first one, but you should have said, 'thanks but no thanks,' to the this one. The constant look on your face of... Oh God I wish they weren't destroying my great movie, but I really need this paycheck, was painful to watch; Not to mention, the I wish I was in my twenties again look. I really felt for ya' buddy.Also, 'gotta' love the uniforms stitched with each player's name on the back. In the original, Caretaker stole the guards' old uniforms. Where did they get these from, Vince McMahon's disbanded football league (I can't remember the league's forgettable name)? I kept looking for, 'He Hate Me.' Sorry, but this movie was so contrived and totally stupid. Moreover, it really sucked!",1,1,3,12 June 2005
Cold Mountain," Should be 'Boring Mountain'
","Come on folks, give me a break.  This movie is about as interesting aswatching a nose bleed.  Minghella fails miserably.  Why can't we useAmerican actors for a subject matter only a true American can fullyunderstand and connect with. Like Mel Gibson in 'We Were Soldiers',Nicole Kidman and Jude Law not credible.  Additionally if I had to watchRene Zellwegger overact with that rediculously contrived character forone more scene I thought I'd puke!  Everyone constantly trying to outact each other in every scene (absent Jude Law). There were also way toomany big name cameos and well known faces; it became so distracting.Probably the best way to get Saddaam Hussein to begin confessing wouldbe to tie him up and force him to watch this movie over and over again. Oh, addtionally it was so obvious that the movie was not filmed in theU.S..  Next to Glory and Gone With the Wind, will anyone ever make atruly great Civil War film?  Oscar?",1,4,8,13 January 2004
Seabiscuit," Finally a movie true to the book!
","Gary Ross did a fantastic job of translating the book into a wonderful movie.  Loved every aspect of the film, from Shwartzman's incredible cinematography to Randy Newman's fantastic score, which was really very un-Newman.  Tobey was great, but Bridges was even better!  The only disappointing aspect was, I felt they could have shown Seabiscuit's quirky character a little more, ie; how most horses only lay down to sleep for 5-10 minutes, where the Biscuit would lay down and slumber for hours.",10,0,0,5 September 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Can you say... 'Director's Cut'?
","Oh please!!! You've got to be kidding me?!  This film was so mediocre and boring.  Obviously this is what happens when the Writer is also the Director is also the Executive Producer.  It was like watching a bad video game on steroids. Besides the insufferable dialogue, I found myself incarcerated to every scene, after scene, after scene.  Whatever happened to pacing? Every scene just dragged on and on, starting with the initial overdone dream sequence and continuing right on through the Caligula-like rock video. Oh, and how about that schoolyard brawl?! Where's Mike Tyson when you need him? After ten minutes of that I couldn't take it anymore.  Help, please someone get me out of the Matrix!!!Forget waiting for the celebrated 14-minute car chase, I can see that on the '405' any day.  So, if you think you can withstand Neo's ridiculous Archbishop 'geddup', bad dialogue, a vague story-line, never ending scenes, repetition and over-stimulation...then I would certainly recommend the Matrix Reloaded to you!!",Null,0,0,23 May 2003
