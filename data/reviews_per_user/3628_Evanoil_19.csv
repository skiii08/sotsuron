The Monuments Men," Totally underrated
","Sometimes i just don't get it , why do good movies like this one are getting low ratings . Lets face it , when you are using the site to check out info about a film ,the rating are the first thing thats coming to your mind. This movie has everything in it to deserve your attention! The cast is incredible , i simply couldn't ask for better cast for a movie like that , war drama with comedy elements in it. The story is very original , i mean , when you couldn't think about something new in the war drama genre here comes this movie that tells us that with great writer and director you can achieve anything. As i said , this movie is very underrated , i completely recommend it for everyone , its even nice for the whole family to watch.",8,2,3,15 August 2015
Child 44," Worth your while
","In order to enjoy this movie you need to completely turn your blind eye to the the mistakes that were made regarding USSR stuff. Also to enjoy this one you need to not care about the fact that lots of scenes were made in Hollywood action movies spirit. Child 44 is packed with great cast , and although Tom Hardy sounds exactly like Bane from Batman when he is trying to speak with Russian accent it seems to work well. The story is based on same name novel , The film adaptation seems to be pretty interesting and nice. I would recommend this movie to everyone , its clever is has tense moments and has very good cast , go watch it you won't regret!",7,2,7,28 July 2015
The Babadook," Only for horror fans.
","As a horror movie fan i was looking for a new title to watch , so i came around this one . It has pretty good reviews so i took a chance. To say that i was scared , Yes, i was at one or two scenes . After a while the movie started to get pretty boring . I can say that this is not a regular kind of horror , I can compare it to indie rock music vs classic rock music . It has its benefits but in general it looks kinda strange and i believe many of the viewers wouldn't understand it and as a result wouldn't like it so much. If you are a fan of horror titles , you will find this movie entertaining at most , but as you l get closer to the end it will get pretty boring.",6,0,5,25 July 2015
Incendies," Incredible
","I didn't think that i would rate a movie 10 before i saw this one. These days , when Avegners and dumb comedies are taking over the box office , it is very hard to stumble upon a masterpiece ,especialy when its a foreign film . Luckily this film is directed by an international known director so i had the privilege to come across the name and the plot of the movie which is by the way is not so special if you do not start to watch the movie. I must say that the first minutes of the film are not so interesting but if you give it a chance it will open up as an incredible masterpiece of a movie. Awesome acting and unexpected turns of events will keep you hooked up till the very end of the movie and at the end you will not stop thinking of what just happened. Strongly recommended to people who got tired of the obvious trash that is going on in 80% if the movie industry right now.",10,1,3,9 October 2016
The Hills Have Eyes," Scary , shocking , interesting!
","I would describe this title as mainly horror fan movie . It could be a tense movie for everyone if it wasn't so gory and shocking in some scenes. Don't get me wrong , it doesn't crosses any red lines or something like that but some of the scenes isn't a thing you see in every horror title. Gladly this movie has a descent score on the site , one that i actually almost agree with so this movie doesn't get underrated for some stupid reasons. The cast is good and the plot is good too even though its not an original one , The tension is kept through all of the movie since the beginning of the action till the credits . I guess this is one of few remakes that is actually better than the original.",7,1,3,27 July 2015
It Follows," Totally overrated.
","I agree , this movie is sure something special . It has almost unique and one of a kind plot . I didn't even read the plot before watching , I saw this movie's trailer at some forum and it said to be one of 10 most anticipated horror titles of the year, Pretty much enough to hook me up on the good feeling about it , Oh and how could i forget to mention that it has a super high score on the site - super high even not for a horror title. So i started watching , and i couldn't understand what is so special about it , Yes it has original plot and nice cast but it just gets extra boring , A little more than a half through , i couldn't be focused anymore . I was disappointed.To sum it up , I would recommend it to anyone but don't come with high expectations or something because you will be disappointed.",5,6,15,26 July 2015
Legend," Forget about Black mass ,this is a gangster movie!
","Interesting movie , recommend to watch it at home. This movie totally worth your while , the plot is good , Tom Hardy provides phenomenal acting talent and even though its about 2 hours long it still doesn't gets boring at any point of the movie. Somehow i missed every information about this movie before , maybe because this year was full with other good movies ,maybe it is underrated .Anyway , i stumbled upon this film by accident and boy oh boy it is a good accident ,the film was made very well and although i don't like it very much when people make movies about gangsters and mobs , this one was very fun to watch and i don't regret a bit the 2 hours i've spent on it.",8,0,0,5 February 2016
Insidious," Watch it!
","Another movie that i should have watched on the big screen , unfortunately i discovered in only 2 years ago. This movie has every horror flick cliché in it , yet it some how wins where other have failed . The cast is incredible , the plot is not too original but nice all packed with nice wrap that the director delivered. This movie is one of the scariest movies i've seen so far and I'm sure that if i watch it two years from now it will still get me at every pun. I strongly recommend this movie not only to the horror fans , and even the toughest horror fans will sure have their dose of adrenaline while seeing Insidious.",8,0,0,26 July 2015
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Bravo
","I could say this movie is back to the roots of POTC but i won't because i just like them all , i don't care if it has the original actors or some stupid out of the blue storyline. Anyway , this one is better then the last ones in some ways .First of all it has a lot of comedy moment which i think is very important , it has young actors on the one hand and a lot of classic ones on the other which i think was very good choice. The plot has the same spirit as in the older films so i have nothing to say , they've done a nice work. Only one thing thats bothering me over and over in all of the films in these series and its the length , its really long and gets borderline boring on the last minutes of the film but its OK i guess. Bottom line , the movie is awesome and although its a little bit too long i give it both thumbs up!",9,0,3,6 June 2017
Ex Machina," Not for everyone!
","This movie was very hard for me to review , I mean i barely can sum it up after the 2nd time i watched it . I will start by saying that it is vary complicated title , it gets you thinking while you are watching and even more after you finish watching it. Needless to say that the cast was very nicely chosen and its very enjoyable even though almost every actor in this one is pretty new in the industry. I can write a lot about this one but as i know nobody likes long reviews so i will sum it up by saying that this movie is not for everyone , It is highly philosophical and can really be enjoyed by very small group of audience , sure it has some pretty tense and action packed moments but it is mostly talkings that are trying to lead the viewer to some kind of an understanding of what the writer was trying to say. Take it where you want but i give this one a 7- .",7,1,3,26 July 2015
Evil Dead," Awesome gory horror
","I wasn't never really a fan of The evil dead trilogy , It is a fun to watch dumb comedish horror witch to be honest you need to be 80-90s guy to like. When i noticed that a remake is coming i wasn't too excited about it so i watched it only a year after it came out. I won't lie , I was a little disappointed that the remake has no comedy elements at all , But i can say with all of my heart that this horror title has something special to it , something you wouldn't find in the latest horror flicks . Yes it is extra gory and i wouldn't recommend it to weak stomach audience but the nice part of this movie is that you don't have to be The evil dead fan to watch it , They made it just right.",8,0,1,26 July 2015
Mama," Nails it!
","This movie has just the right amount of tense to keep you hook until the end. I happened to came across the short Spanish version of this film just a couple of days before i saw the latest Mama . This movie is all you can ask for from a decent horror title , It has nice story and very good director wrapping to it. I won't say that you wouldn't find some clichés in this movie but the way it all was delivered is just right! I wish all of the scary movies was based on Spanish ones because because since they are the masters of this , they are even better the the Japanese. In conclusion , i would recommend this movie to everyone who doesn't afraid of some chills and goose bumps.",8,0,1,26 July 2015
Sinister," One of the scariest titles for now!
","It is very hard for me to put a 9 or 10 on a title because than i would be a hypocrite , Anyway , I will put aside the awesome casting of this movie. To be honest the plot is not very attracting , But as you get deeper into the movie the tense atmosphere is raising and even tough this movie has a lot of horror cliché that's helping you get ready for the next pun , It has its magic , I don't know how but this movie got me really good , I mean i wasn't that scared since 'The Grudge' and 'The ring' . Afted i watched it i was a little upset i couldn't watch in at the theater because its a gem. Recommend it to everyone , especially the horror title fans!",8,0,1,26 July 2015
Don't Breathe," Well done
","I believe that good thrillers make you long for the end yet never wanting it to end really .One thing movies lack these days is an original plot , im really glad this movie hasn't made a big fuss in my country so i wasn't really waiting for seeing it and yet i finally done it.I was very surprised of the high quality of 'Don't breath' i can even say i watched it in one breath , the roles are well played and the plot keeps you hooked up until the very last minute of the movie. I think this is one of the best thrillers made in the past five-six years and i strongly recommend you to go and see it , but be careful ,you might be shocked at the end!",8,0,3,16 October 2016
Sicario," Outstanding thriller
","Hard to find a thriller like Sicario these days , watch it! My thought is that a good Thriller title is the hardest case you can go for as a movie maker .A good thriller has to keep you hooked and in tense for the whole movie ,worst case for most of the movie.Sicario manages to provide the right amount of thrill and action in a way it keeps you interested through all of the time.Sure it had its flaws and sometimes i was a little disappointed with the decision the writers made with this one but when i look at the whole picture its coming up as a very good film , i honestly couldn't stop watching and was a little sad when it was over. I must say though that this movie has a political opinions in it that you cant overlook and it can be a little con for some viewers. Overall , this movie is truly a gem to Hollywood industry right now , very well written and directed plus it has outstanding cast.",8,79,115,28 December 2015
Life," Awful and boring
","I honestly give this title not lower then 5 only because of the actors set.This movie has literally nothing new to bring to the table , it really tries to deliver some kind of new feeling but fail miserably , a very unfortunate thing to be when you have a high number of good actors . I get it , nowdays is very hard to make a good thriller or horror movie but i also believe that if you have to copycat other titles to make your own ,you better just stop before starting , yes I'm saying this movie is made with ideas from 2 3 other movies , very sad , i don't recommend it its a waste of time.",5,2,8,3 June 2017
John Wick: Chapter 2," Unfortunate
","I really liked the the 1st one , i thought it had something new to bring to the action table.I wouldn't say this one is a total opposite but it has something that is very easy to notice , they really tried to make something special out of this one but hell , even Reeves can't save it anymore , unfortunately his acting is terrible in this one , it really looks like Keanu Reeves is making a parody of himself acting. Good word about the story and the concept of this movie in general , it is still looking pretty original . you can give John Wick 2 a pass only if it is the last one , god i hope they will stop here.",5,2,6,6 June 2017
The Nice Guys," One of the best comedies of this year.
","One of the easiest reviews i've done in a while will be done for this movie. Why , you ask. Very simple , this movie can be seen by almost everyone , doesn't matter the age or the gender. It is so well written and played , you don't get bored at any part of the film , It has comedy elements packed with action moments put together so well that there is no chance you will not like this movie. Normally i don't like Ryan Gosling that much ,put this role made him shine from my point of view and I'm happy for it. Sadly i haven't heared about this movie that much so I'm guessing it is not that popular now ,anyway , i recommend this one for everyone .",9,2,6,1 August 2016
Alien: Covenant," Solid Alien title
","This movie falls in the same category as the star wars and Indiana Jones franchises, Im not even sure Scott is caring about getting a new audience. I personally felt a great fulfillment when i watched the movie , it has everything i could ask for , a great plot , great acting and ofcorse a great setup. Would i recommend it to someone who hasn't seen any alien movie or didn't like the Prometheus? No. Unfortunately a lot of reviews are pretty negative and i cant understand why really , the movie is great and keeping up with the world Scott build decades ago , i liked it!",9,12,24,31 May 2017
