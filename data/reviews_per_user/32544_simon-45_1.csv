The Sound of Music," A pure joy
","From the opening sequence of this movie ( which needs to be seen on the big screen)you know that you are to be taken on a fantastic journey.Robert Wise has created a fantastic motion picture which stands up remarkably well in the test of time. The casting is excellent nobody else except but Julie Andrews could have carried this film - her personality shines through with every frame.Christopher Plummer bounces off her perfectly and who could imagine a better Baroness than Eleanor Parker (especially the looks she gives Maria after the puppet show and during Edelweiss),Peggy Wood in a her last screen appearance as the Mother Abbess ( although she was dubbed for the film )she was also nominated for best supporting actress that year. And the kids who shine especially with their scenes with Maria and towards the end of the film they act like a real family when the nazi's are ready to escort Captain Von Trapp to the navy. This is a true story with a lot of fantasy thrown in for good measure but no musical flows as freely as The Sound Of MusicWhat a way to spend an evening being swept off to magical Salzburg with Andrews and Co.",10,3,10,13 November 1998
