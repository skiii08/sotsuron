The New World," Save yourself the money
","The movie starts with the possibility of going somewhere, but dies soon after. Terrible dialog, too long, and Colin just can't carry the writing which is bad in itself. The voice over narratives are annoying and you just want to hit the stop button, but all else is silent except for the cheesy porn sounding music that pipes in periodically when Pochahanta and Jon Smith are in touching scenes together. This film tries to be poignant and artsy, but falls way short. Christian Bale is the only believable character in the film and unfortunately he is only in it for the last 20 minutes. I suppose the lack of dialog could be defended by saying that they spoke 2 different languages, but Pochahantas sure learned fast. The best part of this film is the ending, which comes way too late.",1,6,15,21 January 2006
