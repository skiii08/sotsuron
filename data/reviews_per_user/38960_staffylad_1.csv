Hereditary," So disappointed..
","It amazes me when film companies read scripts and stump up the money for these films. Didn't they read this script. Where was the plot, where was the horror... The only thing saving it was the acting, but it was Toni Collette and Gabriel Byrne.. of course the acting will be good. They always are. I give it 2 points for photography and 2 for acting. Can't justify anymore. Oh, and it's way too long",4,0,1,27 August 2018
