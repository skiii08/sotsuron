Minority Report," Steven Spielberg At his best. 10 out of 10
",I'm a huge lover of science fiction movies. And Steven Spielberg stamp is all over this one.. the one thing I really enjoyed besides the story is the soundtrack.. just like all other Spielbergs moves the music sets the mood. Tom crews does an amazing job as well .. and let's not forget about Colin Farrell.. he kills it. This movie is really good so what you waiting for go watch it !!!!,10,0,0,27 June 2020
