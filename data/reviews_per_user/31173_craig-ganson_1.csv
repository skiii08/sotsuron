Alien 3," The only tragedy is that we had to wait so long for the special edition
","Alien 3 is probably the most misunderstood movie of all time. The thing is, I think that most people in life just jump on the bandwagon, if they hear that a movie is getting bad reviews, then that is what they expect to see. The characters in this movie are fantastic, the story is original, the ideas and dialogue are engaging and the script is well thought out by some very clever people. OK, it had a few rewrites and killed off the survivors from the second movie....who cares? These days, foreign movie makers aren't afraid to kill the main character or do something with their movie that doesn't follow what most people want to see. This movie took a risk and tried something different and I'm very glad for it. 'Aliens' is dated. It's OK as far as the Quadrilogy goes, but it's a little bit tame and cheesy by todays standards. Alien & Alien 3 has aged just fine and are generally for the adults. There aren't enough movies like Alien 3 out there or enough movie companies with the balls to do something different. Alien 3...... best out of them all and an absolute joy to watch. Absorbing, tense, frightening, thrilling and thought provoking with many underlying ideas that makes you notice something new each time you watch it. Scott and Cameron never managed that!",10,32,32,29 December 2011
