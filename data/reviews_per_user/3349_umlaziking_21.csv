Scarface," Amazing,definitely one of the greatest
","I saw a lot of 1 and 2 star reviews and I find it really disturbing,but mostly stupid. Why some ppl hate this film is beyond me but there's a reason why it's in imdbs top 250 films of all time.

The Prestige," My gosh
","How this film didnt win at least one oscar is beyond me, it just shows how much the oscars are full of crap. This film makes you think, you really dont know who to route for and its writing is just.....man i cant even explain it in words. Christian bale and hugh jackman are brilliant actors, they gave oscar winning performances with this movie.

Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Terrible
","Lord have mercy, how can a film be this bad. This is not canon, it cannot be canon. Disney has finally did it, theyve ruined my childhood. So uninspiring, bringing back palpatine was just really disrespectful to george lucas and the fans of star wars. KK is a sith lord and she really needs to go, shes a feminist parasite that deserves to be destroyed from lucasfilm. Im really glad they dont give her much power anymore.",1,11,20,11 May 2020
The Godfather: Part II," Amazing film
","Definitely one of the greatest films ever made, u can't even call this a sequel, it's sooo much more than that, the film mixes the past and present very very beautifully. This film sent shivers down my spine the whole time, with its incredible writing,directing and acting which is another level, if I watched this film 5 years ago, I wouldn't have understood why it's so great, but now that I'm a lot older and finally understand what real cinema is I can say that this film is one of the greatest films I've ever watched.

This film will send shivers down yur spine especially at the end with it's very heartwarming ending.",10,0,0,7 January 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Terrible
","The writers went to far with this one.Somethings wrong with today's society,for ppl to even consider this garbage as one of the greatest films ever made with an of 8.5 is a disgrace.8.5?????seriously,this film is an abomination to marvel fans and the entire human race,there was no love and passion done with this it was only for money.I hate this film and I especially hate the writers who did this,this couldve been the greatest of the greats.",1,37,57,2 December 2019

Princess Mononoke," Its a masterpiece
","This film is really really brilliant, its very well written and has really amazing animation. The only thing i can complain about is that it was pretty man hating.....the men were treated like buffoons that couldnt think or do anything for themselves. Dont get me wrong i loved this movie very much and i wouldve given it a ten, but the women being more masculine than men really threw me off...the main character was the only masculine man. This film is one of the greatest of the greats, i doubt disney will ever have a film as this good.",9,0,0,13 May 2020
The Godfather," Greatest film ever
","I finally understand why this film is said to be one of the greatest or the greatest film, it's writing is just top notch and really keeps u hooked the entire time. The godfather deserves to be in imdbs top ten. What I'm sad about is that we will never get a movie this well written ever again, cuz writers today don't want to think wen they write, they just rehash and remake. I really wish we could just switch the writers of this time and the amazing writers from back then with amazing originality, making films that made ppl think instead of spoon feeding them. A masterpiece, 10 out of 10, I will never forget this movie it's just that goof",10,0,1,8 January 2020
