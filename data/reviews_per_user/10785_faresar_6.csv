The Avengers," Just as i expected
","like i thought so...the characters simply cant be in one movie. It degrades each character because each one has its own environment. Iron man in the technological world...Captain America's character i still cant understand..he is only got that freaking shield that is unique about him. I mean seriously what kinda superhero is he. Thor and his gods which belong somewhere in lord of the ring or something. Hulk who exists due to some chemical reactions and interactions or gamma rays. Each character has a different theme and environment. Bringing them together isn't right. The acting of most of the actors was normal, actually at times it felt they were in a play not a movie. the story is abit silly or i should say typical. It felt like this was a Walt Disney movie and ironically enough it turned out to be a Walt Disney movie, But on the other hand ....the special effects were amazing and there were some funny scenes. Anyway, out of 10 i would give it 6. But well...i have my own taste. I wouldn't probably go for the 2nd sequel of it. I would most likely recommend this to 20 year olds and below.",6,3,11,12 May 2012
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," weak and boring
","Let me start off by saying that i liked the first two films but this one was way below my expectation. I didn't have any high expectation to be this disappointed. It's probably clich√© to say that i feel ripped off and that it was waste of time. I wish i watched 'the fury' instead.The film was weak and very boring. There was nothing interesting going on in the movie. I thought maybe i need to be patient and wait but no the movie ended and there was nothing worth remembering. I do not understand why they split the movie into 2 parts. Part 1 was barely significant...maybe with some creativity they could've squeezed both parts into 1 and make it more interesting.The acting was weak. Even Jennifer overacted her emotions. There was no depth in any character.The whole thing felt like a purposeless boring episode from a long series.Therefore, i really recommend to skip this one and save your ticket for something else.",6,16,28,25 November 2014
Passengers," Ignore the criticism. Go watch it! Its awesome
","When i first saw the rating on IMDb, it was 6.6 with few thousand votes already. I thought to myself oh boy.. 'it turns out its a flop'. As the rating reached 7.1 over time and i saw my friend's reviews i decided to give it a try. I went to the theater with little expectation. Expecting some marvel style action, but boy was i pleasantly surprised.Firstly, graphics were flawless Secondly, the technologies of the future which the movie showed were awesome and thought provoking. For sure something that science lovers would appreciate. Thirdly, the story was captivating so was the acting performance. The lead character was exploring his environment and the tech of the ship and so was the audience and i think that's what made it enjoyable and attractive. Fourthly, as i mentioned, acting was top. The characters were interesting, funny, intelligent and the chemistry between the characters felt real.However the story had its weak moments. There were events which in short were not realistic but i chose to ignore. They were not big deal but it felt like it degraded the movie alittle bit. There was also the moral dilemma which i suspect is one of the reasons why it has such low rating and criticism. It's really about how each person perceived it. For some the end was bad, and others thought it was epic. But i personally loved it. The movie was exactly the type of movies that i love in spite of some of its weaknesses, therefore i rate it 10/10. Because i really enjoyed it and was captivated by it.",9,4,10,7 January 2017
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Why make this movie?
","Solid performances but what is the purpose of this movie? And why so many oscar nominations? It is like the producers thought 'screw the audience. Lets make a boring Hollywood movie for Hollywood movie makers. We are going to get Oscars anyway because we know them and they know us'That's how this whole thing looks like. It was like watching a theater play. The only interesting part was the last 10 minutes.Nowadays, If you produce something weird, or gay, or you support a minority, you get dozen oscar nominations.",6,1,2,17 April 2020
The Mist," Unique Movie
","The Movie was fantastic!. I never seen the trailer...and i didn't know that the movie would include some monsters.. and when i saw that guy getting pulled 'I thought great!..another monsters movie..'which i hate'', but this movie is different!. It was kind of deep...makes you think a little.. and i like movies that have some sort of meaning. The end was truly shocking, though i expected it right when he pulled the gun with the 4 bullets. Opening an inter-dimensional window into another world is creative...it turns on your imagination .. especially if you are the kind of people that like sci-fi and has a wide imagination. Some movies want you to turn on your imagination. Explaining how and why could sometimes spoil it..making it less than expected.I usually come here to comment either on a very bad movie or a very good one that made me think.Oh and btw, Thomas Jane acted extremely well!",9,1,2,28 April 2008
Braveheart," Greatest movie ever performed by elite actors and directed by the brilliant Mel Gibson
","I've seen the reviews here and what i noticed is that most people gave it 10 stars, except for Brits and history lovers. All movies change some facts to make it a 'movie' so face it!. almost everybody who loves watching movies loves this film in spite of how different the real story was. In fact it doesn't matter if the story is real or fictional. The movie is a piece of art, it is as many call it..the greatest movie of all time and i definitely agree with those who say it deserved more Oscars. The soundtracks added special touch to the movie. No matter how many times i see it, i can't get enough of it. After 15 years. 'Braveheart' still amazes me and will remain the greatest movie of all time. Brilliantly acted and directed by the legendary Mel Gibson.",10,2,9,21 October 2010
