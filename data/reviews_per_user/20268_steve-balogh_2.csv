The Ring," Original Japanese version is much better!
","Just a few brief thoughts... In my opinion the ORIGINAL Japanese version of this movie (Ringu, 1998) is much better. There is also a Japanese sequel which is equally good (Ringu 2, 1998). The prequel (Ringu 0, 2000) is somewhat more strained although it tries to explain the history of why things happened in the other two movies. The American version of the film is a direct copy of the Japanese one, and not nearly as good. The only hassle with the Japanese version is having to read the sub-titles. Perhaps I will try to learn Japanese before watching it again. :)",8,0,0,14 November 2002
Pi," One of the worst films I have EVER been exposed to!
",The credits came as a welcome relief. This is the first film that had a physical effect on me... I felt nauseous from about halfway through and could not bear to watch the awful spinning effects. It was like being on a childrens round-about. Yechhh!The black and white effects tried to be arty... it was crap! The audio was terrible. The dialog was meaningless. The technical references bordered on rubbish. The so-called 'supercomputer' WAS rubbish. The acting was awful. The storyline was just a jumbled mess. Whoever decided this was a Sci-Fi must have been delirious at the time. Can you see a trend?Basically this was a really bad film.I gave it a score of 1 but only because ZERO was not an option.,1,10,20,21 February 2002
