The New World," Very bad movie
","This has to be one of the worst movie's I've seen in a long time. I'm only giving it a 3 for the sheer fact that the authenticity was relatively good. The pacing of the movie was horribly off. At one minute it was fast paced with good speed, the next it was agonizingly slow. The romance scenes were almost deliberately boring and repetitive. I must have seen the actress' back like 50 times. The script was almost non-existent and sparse at best. Accents changed or were different from actor to actor, one type being English and the other being a mix of English and American.I will say that the sets, wardrobe, and props were all high caliber, albeit slightly off in the year. All in all, I would say to not watch this movie.",3,0,4,11 July 2006
Avatar," To sum up, world's largest collection of movie rip offs
","I would like to point out that while this movie had a great vibe and overall sense of directing and flow, it's story, plot and general theme is nothing more than a collection of various other movies that have all been at one time popular movies. It is also nothing more than a historical satire on the American expansion and forceful removal of the Native Americans with a Hollywood 'Happy Ending'. The following is a list of movies that were either 'borrowed' from or directly stolen with notes as to how and why; Dances with Wolves -Disheartened man seeks adventure in an unknown land full of danger and excitement only to fall in love with the natives and become one of the tribe.Dinotopia -The scene with the initiation of rider and mount is nothing more than a copy of a Skybax and it's rider.Starship Troopers/Aliens -Since James Cameron directed Aliens, I guess we can forgive the obvious use of mechanized soldiers and various other effects and props from the Alien series.Fern Gully -The entire setting was nothing but a copy of the style and format of many cartoon movies such as Fern Gully.Even most sound effects were just the noises and grunts of the dinosaurs from Jurassic Park. Whether this was intentional or merely the crew at ILM being lazy, well, I guess we'll never know.All in all this movie is nothing more than a guise to attract a younger crowd a false sense of plot lines and story crafting. James Cameron, in the words of a much younger generation....FAIL!!!",2,10,30,24 December 2009
