Ford v Ferrari," This is a rom-com...only it's about cars!
","I was trembling after the win at Daytona. I was angry after Le Mans. I went through a lot of emotions watching this movie, and I loved it.
And then there's Christian Bale. This was a Matt Damon movie, you know, till Bale comes on-screen. He swoops in like the thief he is, and steals the screen from Damon!
If you love your car, love how this machine becomes one with you, understands even the little bits of adjustments you make, and obeys, this movie is for you. If you just let your car run free, let it be the master, you will love this movie. Hell, if you don't love cars, I dare say you will love this movie.",9,1,2,1 March 2020
Ready Player One," Can't-take-my-eyes-off kind of AWESOME!!!
","DISCLOSURE: I am awed by awesome stuff!
This movie is a geek's paradise. Haven't watched it yet and reading this review? Stop! Go and watch the movie. 
I am okay with the changes from the book to the reel. The ending was kinda cheesy, but that lasts only a few seconds. So, no big deal. 
Spielberg went all out on the climax, and the sequence is so jam-packed with references that you will miss a lot of them even if you blink once! 
Goosebumps guaranteed!! 
I missed out on a lot of the references, but boy did I enjoy the movie!",9,0,3,31 March 2018
Jurassic World," This Park is indeed open!!!
","Jurassic World pays a lot of homages to Jurassic Park. So let's get that out of the way! This movie wastes no time going over other subplots but takes you directly to the Park (or is it the World now?!) You have all watched the trailers, and you all know that this kid and his brother go on a trip to Jurassic World, and turns out that they are both nephews of Claire Dennings (Bryce Dallas Howard), the Park Operations Manager. This movie takes place on Isla Nublar where Jurassic Park was staged. The old park also makes a fleeting appearance in this movie. Irrfan (Simon Masrani) is one of the richest men on the Earth and he practically owns InGen, and he is the one who still has the dream of John Hammond alive in his eyes. Well, we are greeted with lots of (Samsung) displays in (ahemÂ…!) the 'Samsung Innovation Centre', and when the camera zooms in on a kid brushing dust out of dinosaur bones, God, I miss Sam Neill & Laura Dern! Soon, we are greeted by a few people in suits and, no, while they are not lawyers, they are the PR team from Verizon who want to sponsor an animal, and (drumroll!!!) we are greeted to the Indominus Rex. People who are on Verizon, be warned, not the least due to the fact that the Park has bad reception! Anyways, with that out of the way, we are introduced to Star Lord (oops), I meant Chris Pratt, who is sort of the ringmaster for raptors, and then hell (or should I say Indominus Rex) breaks loose. The movie is a fun ride but I need to make a few observations. Kids nowadays get scared easily compared to those from '93. I mean, yeah, they are acting, but Jurassic Park had much more thrills and suspense than this one. We are reminded this is a sequel, sometimes when they turn up the original Jurassic Park theme, sometimes by familiar faces like Henry Wu. Last time, Dennis Nedry (the computer guy), had a nefarious agenda. This time also, there is a subplot, which opens the storyline to possible sequels, but does not really go anywhere in this movie. It is a lot to demand of a movie when you put it alongside a movie that you grew up loving, but Jurassic World tries, and partly succeeds, in holding its own. The kids at the plex enjoyed the movie, and I dare say I would too, if I hadn't watched Jurassic Park first. And yeah, if any of the people who worked on this movie are reading this, I do prefer the T. Rex to the Indominus. The T. Rex still rules!",8,22,60,13 June 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Grim never looked so good
","Fury Road brings jaw-dropping dystopian landscapes, and you gotta hand it to the people who dreamed them up. The first storm sequence of the movie which Furiosa enters on the large gasoline truck is just WOW! This movie is about a very grim future, but boy does it look great! Hope hasn't looked so good, and despair so sickening. Theron's Furiosa is a driven individual with hope, hope for a home where she was born, the land of the Mothers. She is one of the prize breeders of Immortan Joe. In fact, all women have been reduced to just that in this world. Furiosa escapes with the rest of Joe's prize breeders, and we get this chase of a movie. I personally favor movies with CGI that blends with the environment so much so that it doesn't look like CGI anymore, and Mad Max Fury Road achieves that, and I love it. Good performances all around also help. Hugh Keays-Byrne's Immortan Joe is adequate and played with appropriate fury! Theron's Furiosa drives the movie, and the parts that she doesn't, Tom Hardy's Max and Nicholas Hoult's Nux take up the job. Overall, a great movie, definitely worth a watch.",8,2,12,30 May 2015
