Walk the Line," Johnny Cash
","This was a great movie. I really biographic movies like this movie and A Beautiful Mind and La vie en rose. I've never really known who Joaquin Phoenix was because when I saw Gladiator I didn't know what he looked like. I knew that he was nominated for an Oscar for this movie and that Reese Witherspoon won one for this movie so I decided to see it. Reese Witherspoon was amazing and she sang really well with this amazing voice. Joaquin Phoenix surely deserved to have won the Oscar. He completely immersed into the character and his singing was just as good.Normally, I don't like country music but the soundtrack of this movie is great, probably only because when I listen to a certain song I think back to the movie. The way the movie was filmed and the story was just great. It made me want to learn more about Johnny Cash who I've never really care about before but after this movie I can't believe that he never got a number one billboard hit.Great movie.",8,0,1,6 October 2008
The English Patient," Beautiful Movie
","Anthony Minghella is one of my favorite directors. Cold Mountain, Talented Mr. Ripley all were great and there are some similar parts in all his movies. The English patient however is the best movie he has ever done. Its a beautiful movie. The script was great and the acting was phenomenal. This is one of the movies were Ralph Fiennes deserved to win the Oscar. The main theme song in this movie is very emotional and one of my favorite soundtracks.Some people might call it long but you have to admire everything that is happening and really get into the movie to love it. I wish that they would make more movies like this. This is one of the few movies that have made it on my favorites list.",10,3,5,6 September 2008
Zodiac," Pretty Good
",This movie was pretty good. I haven't seen many of David Fincher's movies but I have seen Fight Club and Panic Room and this movie is almost just as good as those. It really should have earned more money at the box office and had more success than what it did have. The acting in the movie was good but not amazing and there were some parts in the movie that got to be a little long but other than that the script was great and there were some suspenseful parts. I would recommend watching this movie if you like crime and thriller stories. It isn't as violent and bloody than the other David Fincher movies so this would attract a different sort of audience.I can't wait for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button!,6,0,4,15 August 2008
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Disappointed
","I love everything about harry potter. All the movies and the books. Except for this movie. But that's okay because this movie wasn't really a Harry Potter movie. It just had the same actors and storyline.There was no magical feeling in this movie. All the magic was GONE.The soundtrack was okay. It would have been a great soundtrack if this movie wasn't part of a franchise, but as a Harry Potter movie it failed completely to incorporate the magic that John Williams so well added in his score. Also, this sounds too much like The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (change it up a bit Alexandre Desplat). No inclusion of the Hedwig's theme, whats up with that!? Maybe they played it once at the beginning really lightly so you can't hear it since everyone's cheering when the movie's starting anyway.The adaptation of the book was overall pretty good but I felt like it rushed through some things. I was kind of disappointed that they didn't put in Harry's birthday scene, Kreacher's story, more from Rita Skeeter's book, and more from the Dursley's departure scene. Although somehow they did find the time to add some completely ridiculous and awkward scenes such as the dance between Harry and Hermione (which the entire theater was laughing at) and the kiss between Harry and Hermione (which the entire theater was screaming at). It felt like David Yates was trying to make the audience think that Harry and Hermione have a thing, when they Don't at all. Also, what happened to all the careful planning for the break in at the Ministry and Kreacher's home cooked meal that was waiting for them :(Special effects were okay and the comedy bit was fine too. Cinematography was a little bit too overdone and the animation of Dobby was pretty bad. It didn't look bad it was just too different from the 2nd movie. I mean he looked fine in the 2nd movie, why change him??Oh also, what was going on in that Deathly Hallows/3 brothers scene. That was just so inappropriate and totally not harry potterish.Overall, I was disappointed and it just wasn't a Harry Potter movie for me. I was excited to see how this movie could be nominated for some Academy Awards, but truthfully after seeing it I don't think they really deserve in the nomination. Maybe, cinematography if voters like the overdone excessive look or maybe one of those technical Oscars.Second part should be better, hopefully. As long as David Yates doesn't suck the magic out of that one too.(Just saw it again. Much better. I still mean what I said above but not as strongly)",7,10,19,20 November 2010
American Beauty," Best Comedy
","This is a very good movie. There are some funny parts, there are some sad parts, there are some suspenseful parts.This is what movies should be like. It doesn't deserve a ten because its not one of those movies that you can't forget for the past week. The director Sam Mendes does a very good job and the acting in this movie is spectacular. The story line was very good and so many things happen during movie that you start wondering how the heck all this could happen. It won 5 Oscars and this movie sure deserved it. However, Anette Benning deserved to win the Oscar and not Hilary Swank.The music in this movie fit perfectly with the mood and what was going on with the movie. This is just that type of movie you can watch over and over again without getting tired of seeing it.",8,1,2,22 August 2008
The Usual Suspects," The Usual Suspects
",The entire movie was great but the ending scene was what really made me think it was a particularly good movie compared to other movies. I think Kevin Spacey is a great actor and that the Oscar was rightfully his. Good thing he got it. And the script was great because it has all these complicated twists and turns and really makes it be a great mystery movie. The other actors in this movie were good also but they weren't really good. This movie is a classic and everybody who has seen this will remember Keyser Soze. It has a fairly good soundtrack throughout the film. I loved the ending scene. It was completely unexpected and great. It deserves to be number 21 on the IMDb top 250.,7,1,2,30 September 2008
Schindler's List," amazing
",When I put the DVD in and the menu came in I already knew that the soundtrack was going to be amazing and it was. I loved how the movie was in black and white and it really fit in with the story and how dull times were during the holocaust. If it had not been in black and white the movie wouldn't have been as good. The picture in this movie was so beautiful and the directing by Steven Spielberg was very good also. Im glad that this movie won a lot of Oscars. The acting by Liam Neeson and Ralph Phiennes was amazing but I can understand why Tom Hanks won that Oscar for Philadelphia.This is one of those few movies that become so emotional near the end that its hard not to start crying. The ending scene gave me goosebumps everywhere. It sure deserves the 8.9 rating and I bet it has a very high score on rotten tomatoes. If I hadn't by mistake seen the second part of the movie first I bet I would have enjoyed this movie a lot more.,8,9,13,5 September 2008
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Fun movie to see that doesn't disappoint
","The eternal sunshine of the spotless mind was a great movie. When I first saw this I didn't know what it was about I just wanted to see it because Kate Winslet was in there and that it got really good reviews. Though I don't normally like Jim Carrey I thought that in this movie he really was great and he didn't act stupid like in his other movies.I loved the storyline and I'm really glad that it won the Oscar for that and it should have won the Oscar for best actress for Kate Winslet because she was extraordinary as usual for almost all her movies. There were funny parts in this movie and there were sad parts and there were shocking parts. Basically there was everything a good movie needs.The only part that i didn't enjoy as much is when it shows mark rufallo and elijah wood who are both great actors and same for kirsten dunts and tom wilkinson but I thought it was kinda boring but maybe it was just because Kate Winslet wasn't in those scenes :)Anyway, watch this movie if you like good comedy movies and romantic movies. Don't hesitate in seeing this and just watch it because you won't be disappointed.",7,0,3,11 September 2008
A Beautiful Mind," Another Great Movie
","This movie is very good and deserves an 8 out of 10. The storyline in this movie was great because I had no clue of what was going to happen so I laughed at all the right moments and I gasped at all the right moments too. I was completely INTO the movie. The acting by Russell Crowe was magnificent and I don't know why he didn't win the Oscar but I didn't see the Denzel Washington movie yet so I don't know. Jennifer Connely was beautiful in this movie and did an amazing job at acting, mostly that one scene in the bathroom. She totally deserved the Oscar. James Horner does it again with the soundtrack and its great but it does resemble the Titanic music a little bit too music. You really got the feeling while watching this movie that it was beautifully directed and had a great picture. This is a great movie to watch and I would recommend you seeing it as soon as possible.",8,1,3,14 September 2008
Gladiator," Gladiator
",This was a great movie although it did take me three times to think that. The first time I saw it I was disappointed because I had expected a much better movie. The second time I saw it right after I had seen A beautiful mind and walk the line so I really enjoyed the acting in this movie by Joaquin Phoenix and Russell Crowe. The third time I saw this movie I thought it was just amazing and everything that happened during the movie was great. The music by Hans Zimmer is fantastic though it does resemble to the Pirates of the Caribbean music a little bit. The costumes and the special effects and the color in this movie was just fantastic. Joaquin Phoenix should have won the Oscar for his role. Crowe rightfully deserved his win.,8,1,2,12 October 2008
