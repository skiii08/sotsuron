50 First Dates," I Hate Adam Sandler, But I Liked This Movie
","When I saw this film on Netflix, I had a feeling I would despise it. After all, I hate Grown Ups 1 and 2, Jack and Jill, and pretty much everything Adam Sandler has put out since he's become comfortable with his fame.And that feeling was still there the first 20 minutes. It had all the bad Adam Sandler-movie clich√©s. A weird guy, who is more creepy than funny (two in this one), kids saying inappropriate words and giggling, and Adam Sandler somehow being able to directly communicate with animals.And then everything just changes... completely.I was struck with a LOGICAL dilemma. Adam Sandler falls in love with a girl who wakes up every morning not remembering the last day. The parts of the movie that work off of this genius idea are brilliant and entertaining as hell. The comedy during these parts is actually good, too.Even though the movie occasionally goes into dumb territory, the main plot kept me watching and invested, and for this the film gets a solid 8/10. Get rid of all the unfunny parts and this film could have been a 9.",8,1,1,24 November 2013
Argo," Best Picture? What Were They Thinking?
","Yeah 1 star sounds extreme, I know. But the reality is that the people who actually saw the film need to bring the film's rating down somehow. In reality I'd give this film 6 stars on 10. While Ben Afleck is a great actor and a great director, the script is just horrendous when it comes to the standards for what should constitute Best Picture.THE BAD:We are introduced to several characters. They are in Iraq when the people turn on the US embassy and start kidnapping the people in there. These characters are the 6 or so that escaped the mess and are seeking refuge in the Canadian embassy.The first major problem of the movie is that none of these characters are characters. They have no arcs. And even worse, they have no static personality. It's hard to care about a group of people who don't display any form of humanity. Anyway, next problem: Ben Afleck. While he shows that he can act, his character is also boring. He's divorced, he has a son that he cares about, he's the tough but smart guy who's gonna go in and save everyone. It's super unoriginal and his character doesn't do much to make you care about him.A lack of character, and thus heart, really sinks the movie. Additionally, the film is not at all historically accurate, but I'll be honest I don't really hold things like that against a film. It's just worth noting, I guess, since some people get offended that the film is disrespecting historical figures through misrepresentation. One more thing: I kind of found the depiction of Arabs as all insane kind of racist... it'd be awesome of they could have made some of the Arabs good people to fight that Western propaganda notion that all the Arabs are 'evil Al-Qaedas.'THE GOOD:John Newman and Christopher Walken's characters were awesome. I don't think it's how they were written, it's just that they are great actors to watch. They were a highlight.Also, the directing was great. While I had no reason to care about the characters, Afleck still manages to successfully create tension during several small moments and during the final chase. THE VERDICT:This film has some value. It demonstrates Afleck's directing abilities, I enjoyed seeing John Newman and Christopher Walken's characters interact, and I did learn some history (even though it's inaccurate, I learned the real story by going on Wikipedia, would have never did that if I never saw the movie).Yet, it lacks character, and as a result any humanity.6/10. A Best Picture this is not.",1,4,6,4 October 2014
Star Trek Into Darkness," Into Darkness is an Exceptional Film
","Light Spoilers: Won't Ruin Anything Into Darkness is an Exceptional Film. Movie's of it's genre (action-adventure) are barely done this well in this day and age. They're usually subject to easy praise that they don't deserve (Captain America, The Avengers, etc...) which makes me avoid them at all cost. This film, though... It's like a carefully crafted 1970's action-adventure film made in the age of CGI.Some people don't like this style because it isn't the original Star Trek. I get where they're coming from. This film is more like Indiana Jones in space with a Star Trek theme than the original Star Trek films. But honestly, it's too late to complain about that as the reboot was already made and released to critical acclaim. And who really wants someone to remake the old Star Trek films. They are already made and if you miss them, just go back and watch them. With all the bad remakes going on, I'd rather watch something different and creative rather than the film that would ultimately ruin Star Trek. J.J. Abrams just knows what makes a good movie.Why 9 out of 10? This movie is a must see, but did have some distracting flaws. For instance, the original Spock makes a ten second cameo that feels really out of place (it's not even explained) and the ending is kind of anti-climatic. These flaws aren't significant, but they do hurt because they felt like lazy decisions on part of the writing team.Either way, great movie and a must-see for anyone who is a fan of action movies, sci-fi, Star Wars, the original Star Treks (although, you must be open-minded), and the reboot.The only people who won't like it are those who know they hate these kinds of movies. Definitely not for you, but the reboot definitely is and maybe it would even get you into the series.",9,1,5,15 September 2013
21 Jump Street," GOLD! Why Do So Many People Hate?
","PREAMBLE:Let's start off with one thing: I have standards when it comes to comedy. I hate everything Happy Madison stands for (the company behind Grown Ups and Jack and Jill). But I don't understand why people hate this movie. When I saw it, I was blown away.The common complaint I see on IMDb is that the film's humor is immature. It uses too many 'penis jokes.' While I understand why some people don't like this form of humor, it doesn't make 21 Jump Street a bad film. And, while the comedy was never Monty Python, it never went overboard (except in one scene). But I digress.People act as if a film needs to be a British satire to be enjoyed. People are judging the film by its genre; instead they should be judging it by how well it tells an entertaining story. And boy does it do a good job. THE GOOD1)It doesn't take itself seriouslyHonestly, the fact that this film never takes itself seriously is probably the main reason why I found myself laughing the entire time rather than pointing out what would obviously happen next. It also leads to some clever jokes. Their Officer mentions the fact that the two protagonists are overdone stereotypes, that this film is essentially a shameless reboot of an unoriginal concept, and etc... 2)Great ActionI hate films that are all action and no story (essentially I hate Michael Bay). That's why I'm happy that this film has only a few, but extremely memorable, action scenes. Really well done and entertaining.3)It's all about the chemistryThe chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum is incredible. I found myself extremely invested in 'what would happen next' even though I essentially knew the answer.4)The plotYeah, it's no Breaking Bad, but it works extremely well. What separates Grown-Ups from this film is a clever plot that moves the film forwards and gives jokes context. Even though I've seen this story a million times, this film made it feel like the first time.THE BAD1)The genreIf you don't like crude humor and the very-sight of Jonah Hill, or comedians such as Jack Black or Will Ferrell makes you want to vomit, avoid this film. It isn't for you. CONCLUSIONAssuming you're okay with crude humor, see this film. It's hilarious, action-packed, fun and dumb, with some sprinkles of intelligence. You won't regret it.",9,2,6,13 January 2014
Titanic," Titanic and Avatar: Two Films Hated Because of 'Simple' Plots
","Titanic and Avatar are very different. One is about a forbidden love aboard a doomed ship. The other is about humans trying to exploit an alien race in order to profit. Yet both have something very similar in common: they are criticized for having unoriginal stories.Titanic is a love story about a doomed couple. People complain that it's been done before (Romeo and Juliet) and that it's boring. They only enjoy the second half which consists of everyone dying. I'm here to say that is an unfair call.THE GOODThere's nothing wrong with an unoriginal story, as long as the execution is good. After all, we're running out of original stories. Even Shakespeare had a tendency to take other people's stories. He just told them really well. So, is Titanic well executed? yes, on the most part. While it does have it's flaws, I think the bulk of the film is amazing. It's well paced, the characters are well-developed, the cinematography is awe-inspiring, and the conflict is one that continues to exist today (people being forced into loveless relationships due to different pressures). Like Romeo and Juliet, this film is a classic.THE BADThis is a nitpick. Cameron decided to make the film as if an older Rose is telling a captain the story via flashback. That's fine and it works well the entire film. But the ending is just rushed and not much of a lesson like ti should have been. The Captain of the submarine crew should have disposed of the Heart of the Ocean, not Rose. That way it would show Rose's lesson got through to someone. Why even introduce the Captain and a conflict if they're just going to be forgotten at the end of the film.Once again, a nitpick, but the movie is three hours. Why is the ending so rushed? I just wished they could have gave the future part of the film a more satisfying ending.VERDICTGreat film, 9/10, see it! Whether you'll like it or hate it, this is one of the four essentials of the 90's, along with Pulp Fiction, Terminator 2, and Forrest Gump.",9,5,9,24 December 2013
The Matrix Reloaded," Shameful
","IF YOU LIKE DEEP ANALYSIS, HERE YOU GO:I love the first Matrix film. It is a great tribute to the Hero's Journey, basically a plot that is over 2000 years old and just keeps on reoccurring over and over in media everywhere. Star Wars was one of the first modern movies to purposefully use it as a template. The Matrix is the second most popular to do so. And both movies prove how great the formula is, and why it was able to survive thousands of years. Sequels are where things get complicated. Movies that follow the Hero's Journey are very self- contained. Star Wars and the Matrix were designed to be stand-alone films. The Empire Strikes Back, sequel to Star Wars, was able to overcome that. It basically expanded upon the Hero's Journey, showing that Luke did not overcome everything yet. He is still a crappy Jedi who acts on emotions. All the tropes of the Hero's Journey are renewed to extend the story. These tropes include having a wise mentor and an evil enemy. Yoda replaces Obi-Wan as a wiser mentor and the Emperor is introduced as the greater enemy. The Matrix Reloaded does the opposite. Instead of expanding the Hero's Journey, it forgets it all together. Instead of being still an apprentice with a lot to learn, Neo is basically Super- Man/God. He is pretty much invincible. Nothing can kill him. This is the movie's biggest mistake. Neo is no longer a relatable, vulnerable, and still-learning main character. The worst part is the relatability of the Hero's Journey is its greatest strength. Next, the Matrix Reloaded does not have much of a story. It feels more like a video game. There are cutscenes to give you a quick idea of whats going on, then 30 minutes of action (which you can't even play). The action scenes are amazing, but I soon got really bored of them because they dragged and I couldn't be invested in the action because I didn't care about the characters. How could I care about a person I know can't die or people I never got to know. Also, the movie is not at all self-contained. The first part of the film sets up a ton of plot points that never resolve. There is no excuse for that. Even Lord of the Rings, a trilogy that continues exactly where it left off every film, has three self-contained films with a beginning, a middle, and an end.Second big mistake is its confusing. First, the movie does not introduce the concept of the Matrix or clearly show what it is. New viewers will not know what the Matrix is. Exposition is a necessity. It doesn't have to be in long monologues that explain everything, it can be just by showing how the Matrix works. Speaking of long monologues, this film has way too many of them. Characters continuously go on about nonsense. The Wachowskis tried to sound smart, but there's nothing smart about going on about nothing. Especially if its wasting my valuable time. Another thing is that whatever little story the movie has, it doesn't make sense. And trust me, I analyzed the entire Architect speech at the end, its not that part that confuses me. Its always the why. Why is never explained. Its always characters saying they don't know why, it just happened that way. Which is lazy screen writing. The way to make a universe fun and real is to create simple rules and stick to them. I'm going to go back to Star Wars: Star Wars is set in a futuristic setting, there is a magical field of energy called the force, and there are good and bad people who could use it. That's it. The movie sticks to these rules and everything works out fine.I think the highway scene really says everything that's wrong with this film. The high way scene is full of AMAZING stunt work and special effects. But I was bored after five minutes of it. Why?3 reasons: 1. I did not care for the characters, because I did not get to know them this time around 2. It was way too long 3. Way too many villains, why did the film have so many bad guys, it was like Spider-Man 3. Seriously, we have a computer program guy with two albino ghost henchmen, Mr Smith, and the computer agents. Once again, Star Wars: one villain named Darth Vader (until the last film, but that was okay because Darth Vader needed to kill him to redeem himself and all, it was necessary to the plot)So this film is a mess. I give an 8 on 10 to a film that tells a complete story, is self-contained (all plot lines resolved, everything has a purpose), and makes no huge mistakes. 7 out of 10 goes to a film that more or less gets it right, but maybe takes a few missteps. Most films I watch are 7 or 8. 6 is rare, its a film that gets enough wrong for it to be ruined. Then 5... 5 is a film that is a mess. It may still have one good thing to offer, but its bad enough to be not worth the watch. Matrix Reloaded gets a 5 out of 10Yeah the review was long, yeah it was pretentious, yeah I put no effort into the grammar, but its my honest opinion at the very least :PTo everyone in IMDb, stay classy.",5,1,2,19 April 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Another Disappointment (If you like your movies smart)
","ONE MINOR SPOILERCatching Fire was simply okay. Not bad, not great. While I usually couldn't care less about similar movies, the Hunger Game series as a whole genuinely upsets me. Mainly due to the potential it could have had. BACKGROUNDThe first book was excellent and so smart for a book geared towards teenagers. It had social commentary and teenagers killing each other. I have no idea how it got so popular with these two factors working against it. But it it did.The first film, if left in the hands of a skilled director, could have broken the trend of mediocre teen films and made something actually memorable. Unfortunately, it failed. It tried to mash too much material into one film. It also failed in developing believable and likable characters... especially the protagonists. Most people told me they ended up feeling bad for Gale, when in the book it clearly the opposite. When the girl died, I genuinely did not care... compared to the book when I actually shed a tear or two. THE BADNow, with all that said, Catching Fire was a chance to redeem the series. I saw the running time and was hopeful that maybe this time around the characters would be well defined. Catching Fire was my least favorite book in the series (many people hate me for that) so I was hoping maybe this film could make me like it... it didn't.Just like the book, I liked the first half and couldn't care less about the second half. I never liked the idea of returning to the Hunger Games, and I hoped this film would change my opinion, but it failed. Just like the book, I fail to understand why they would return. Just like the book I wished they never made a sequel. As for the long running time, the film just dragged on. It felt longer than it actually was due to a lack of attachment to the characters. I did not feel for any of them. I also didn't like how they never even explained that the mother and child operating on Gale are Katniss' mom and sister. I forgot what they looked like and I read the book when it came out, so it took me a while to figure it out. That's bad writing. While directors/writers like Tarantino and Fincher are able to use two or three lines to let an audience know who a character is and what they are like, fifty lines cannot be used in this film to say anything.THE GOODIt's a shame that the acting was really good. The whole cast put up a great performance, despite their really half-assed dialogue.Especially for Jennifer Lawrence. She does such a great job, despite the terrible dialogue she is presented with. I felt like she was just screaming Peeta's name the entire film. She also comes across as a bit unlikable due to her dialogue, but that's everyone but her's fault.Woody Harrelson also makes an amazing Haymitch. Just like the original film, I wouldn't have minded seeing more of him.VERDICTCatching Fire gets a 6 out of 10. It's entertaining and everything a dumb teenage drama should be. It only hurts that the film, as well as it's prequel, should have been a lot more. A better script with better dialogue and character development would have made all the difference.",6,3,11,24 December 2013
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Yeah, I'm Gonne Get A Lot of Down Votes...
","I don't see the genius. Let's just get this clear first... I was born in 1995. That makes me 18 years old. I don't hate this movie one bit, but I do think the humor has aged. I don't laugh as hard because Monty Python humor has influenced every other comedy out there, and thus it's like I've seen it before. I'm sure in 1975 everything in this film would have been out of nowhere and nonsense. After seeing a movie like Anchorman, it's hard to say I laughed as much because Anchorman is so much more out there. It outdoes this film. But regardless, I appreciate this film, as I appreciate Monty Python, because I know it did a lot for comedy. Without it, there'd probably be no Anchorman as we know it.GOODThe WRITING is good. Even for a nonsense comedy, it creates some likable characters and interesting scenarios. JOKES ARE PROPERLY SET-UP and even though the film essentially uses the set-up-punchline by scene formula rather than focusing heavily on a story, everything feels relevant enough (unlike a 100 Hundred Ways to Die in the West or whatever that movie was called).The ACTING is great. Not much to say, but you never feel like your watching an actor. While the COMEDY is aged from what I saw, it still had some very funny moments. And I'm sure if I saw the film drunk or with friends, I would laugh a lot more. BADThe only bad thing about this very influential film is that the COMEDY HAS AGED. Movies like Anchorman have outdone it, at least for my generation. VERDICT8/10It's a well-made low-budget film that's had a noticeable impact on comedy. While I can't enjoy it like someone who lived in the 70's, I still found it funny at some points and perhaps some others would even find it funnier than I did. Maybe it's just not my type of comedy. Either way, I won't deny this film deserves every bit of praise it gets. It just won't get a 10/10 from me.",8,1,6,14 August 2014
The Great Gatsby," Flaws Ruin What Should Have Been Truly Spectacular
","To begin, I find it annoying that all anyone complains about is the music not fitting the times. I think that's one of the strong points of the film. I really don't like all the artists involved in the film (besides Jack White) but the music worked well. It shouldn't be a problem unless you believe that a movie needs to be 100% true to the source material. I liked the visuals, too. It was all very cool, and it wasn't overdone to the point where it distracted from the story.THE PROBLEM IS THE STORY ITSELFLet's get something clear: if this movie would have been handed over to a great director... let's say David Fincher... in post-production it would have been movie of the year hands down. The only thing that ruined the film was the editing. And yes, it RUINED it. It killed this film. The most aggravating part of it all is we all know by now this is just 'a certain director' trying to pretentiously assert to us that he is 'arty' and 'edgy.' Which is fine, unless you destroy all sense of pace that the film has! The pacing was just awful... especially in the first half.It was edited so literally every thirty seconds the location changes. Meanwhile our narrator, Tobey Maguire, speed reads what seems like too much dialogue. It hurts to watch these scenes.Everyone says the second half is better: and while it is, it's only because the acting was so strong it occasionally broke through the bad editing. Especially DiCaprio. This film could have been the highlight of his recent career. I honestly didn't feel as invested in the characters as I should have been. There were a few really well done scenes, and they only made me more angry at he bad one's.Tobey Maguire is another problem. I don't think it's his fault. I think it's just the approach he decided to take or the director (sorry Baz but it has to be said) instructed him to take. He just wasn't that interesting or notable, with the exception of a few scenes where he works to his strong points. It's not good that the movie is centred and narrated by such a weak character.While the acting and sets/animation are truly AMAZING, the flaws just kill the film. It's not the must-see movie of the year like it should have been, it's just a decent film.Bottom line: Baz Luhrmann should not be allowed to work on post-production with the exception of special effects. He's a great director, visionary, and writer... but man he does not get pace. If you're doubting the importance of pace, go see this movie. Maybe then you'll understand.",7,0,2,14 September 2013
