Angels & Demons," not very good adaptation
","Ron Howard's movie does not do justice to a pretty good novel. I was very disappointed by his cutting major characters and themes of the book. The movie does not go into any detail about the major theme of the book and why the villain did what he did. So many changes were made it is arguable as to whether or not the movie is based on Mr. Brown's book or just borrowed a few ideas from it. Anyone who enjoyed the novel will be disheartened by all the changes that make the movie confusing rather intriguing. The movie starts out with a scene slightly similar to one that takes place much further on in the book. The head of the scientific research center, who was a major character in the book, is completely eliminated. The British writer and camera person are not in the movie at all and I don't recall them mentioning the relationship between the female star and the murdered scientist who had 2 careers that seemed to be at odds but are a major reason for his anti - matter research. Nor do they even point out the real cause for the pope being killed.",3,8,12,29 June 2009
