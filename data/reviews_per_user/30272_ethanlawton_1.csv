The Avengers," Amazing worth the time and the money to check it out.
","This was my favorite one out of all of them so far out of all the marvel movies. I've seen it twice already (Midnight showing then the first one in the morning) And both time's i jumped, laughed, and had a fantastic time watching it. I have a few tips before you check it out Tip one is is wait for after all the credits, there will be less then a minute of them then something then there will be like 5 minutes of them then something again. Tip two. Make sure you either know the comics or have seen all the movies of marvel because if not you will most likely get lost. Only thing is i wish they would have had is spiderman in the movie (not a huge deal) but still who does not love him? Overall i would give it 10 out of 10 stars because of the action, laughter, and everything else that comes along with it.",10,1,5,4 May 2012
