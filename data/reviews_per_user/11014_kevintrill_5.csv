The Avengers," Still cheesey as ever
",I get why these films are so popular and why they have done so well.. But I kind of wish they were a bit more serious and a bit less cheesey. Great action and seeing all these guys on one screen is a spectical,8,0,1,16 April 2020
The Incredible Hulk," Good fun
",Marvel films tend to be normally filled with cheesey moments this one almost avoids that bar one scene.. It's great fun and the fight scene at the end is good fun to watch and well done,7,0,0,13 April 2020
Iron Man 3," One of my favourite marvel movies
",The iron man series doesn't dissapoint across all three films.. And this one was really good and had a great villain and great subplot. Good fun good action and you believe Robert as the iron man,8,0,1,17 April 2020
Thor," My least favourite of the avengers
",The film was OK found Chris the guy who plays thor.. To be very clinche and not very good.. But as the film went on the better it got,7,0,0,14 April 2020
Thor: The Dark World," Not the as good as the first
",What I was expecting to be honest the highlight of the film for me is loki I don't tend to do huge reviews probably for the best as my grammar and opinions are not brilliant... But you Purley have to watch this to complete the mcu universe... It's not terrible just not in the same league as the others,6,0,0,22 April 2020
