"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," An Adventure in the Cycles of Life
","Beyond the campiness of the ABBA tunes, the outrageous costumes, and the superficial drag queen/transsexual jokes is the story of three different stages of life as we encounter them.We meet Tick/Mitzi, Adam/Felicia, and Bernadette (don't call her Ralph) heading out to the Outback in Australia for a gig.  Our heroines have their run of the mill 'adventures' on their trip but what elevates this film is the exploration of the needs of each of them.Felicia is in his mid 20s and all he wants to do is have fun and danger. He doesnt have a problem in the world and he doesnt care to have them.  His youth is not going to be wasted.Mitzi, in his mid 30s is starting to think about being a bit more responsible.  We discover that the manager at the hotel where they're due to perform is actually his ex-wife and if that weren't enough, his son is waiting for him as well.  Mitzi, like most people in their 30s with children wonders if he'll be a good father.Bernadette is in her mid 50s.  She's gone past the first two ages.  Her only concern now is someone to spend the rest of her days with.  Luckily, she finds Bob.In this subtle way, we're pulled in to identify with and feel for these people.The acting was superb.  Although Terence Stamp got most of the accolades, Hugo Weaving and Guy Pearce were brilliant as well.  Despite your opinions on ABBA, you'll probably enjoy the soundtracks as well.  Definately required viewing.",Null,2,5,19 May 2000
