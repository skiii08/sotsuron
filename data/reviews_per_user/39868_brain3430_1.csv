United 93," The story of United flight 93 on 9-11-01
","Great production, the story needs to be kept 'raw' as some of the victims family members have stated. I like that there were non actors playing themselves and some not well known actors playing the victims. The movie in my opinion was done in good taste, not over the top since much of what happened is purely speculation. Paul Greengrass had permission from each victims family members and had his crew interview each family extensively so the victims would be portrayed as true to life as possible. My only complaint is the constant motion of the camera, I would guess it was done in this way to give a 'chaotic' feel or maybe to have it seem more like a documentary. The shaky camera gave me an intense head ache right away. By the end of the movie (from this and the adrenaline from intense emotions) I was quite nauseated. I feel the end of the movie was perfect....I cant say more or I will spoil it!",9,2,6,29 April 2006
