Alien 3," Ambivalence. Ambivalence.
","If this was a one-off movie, everyone would be raving about it. Fine acting and special effects. Dark story (brave to be so downbeat in Hollywood nowadays).Nevertheless, I wish this film had never been made. It is a complete betrayal of Aliens and its hard-won happy ending. If it was a better movie that Aliens then the plot might have been justified. But it isn't. I go out of my way to avoid this movie. And that's a shame.",Null,0,3,1 September 1999
Forrest Gump," Revisionist history:- after only 30 years.
","The thing that really spoils my enjoyment of this film is the way history is re-written.Not ancient history, but history which I lived through. In real-life the anti-war protesters were venting their disapproval of what they earnestly felt was an immoral war. They took a lot of knocks from the powers that be for their troubles as well.This movie depicts them as shallow, selfish, manipulative, power-driven, and even violent people (there's irony for you!) who were 'Unamerican' in every sense of the word.The odious message of this movie is that ignorance is bliss. Don't think about things and everything will work out nicely and you will be happy. Well at least you'll get rich - which in most American movies is close enough.It's enough to make a person gag.Oh, and the fact it beat Pulp Fiction and Shawshank Redemption to the best picture Oscar doesn't help either.",5,7,12,3 January 2000
Life Is Beautiful," Disappointing.
","My girlfriend and I went to see this last night. She thought it was the most moving film she'd seen in years. I was hardly moved at all.
Best Actor? A one note performance as far as I could see. Constantly manic, ignoring rather than reacting to what was going on around him. Very few nuances suggesting what his character must have *really* been feeling in the camp. There was only one scene where he managed to do this, and it was well put over. This was where he finally realised that Horst Buchholz was not going to help him. The mask disappeared briefly. Excellent scene.I suppose you have to like Guido in the first place to be moved by him. I thought he was a shallow and selfish jerk. Maybe that's where the film and I parted company. I never cared that much about him because of that.It's seems to me that this film was less about the triumph of the human spirit, and more about extolling the virtues of self-delusion. This runs counter to my philosophy of life (too much of this in the world) and is yet another reason for my dislike of this film.Contrary to what my girlfriend jokingly said of me after she heard my reaction to the film, I *do* have soul <g> and am quite easily moved by a good movie. This one left me cold...",Null,4,9,19 August 1999
