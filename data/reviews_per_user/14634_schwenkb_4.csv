The Legend of Bagger Vance," Incredibly stupid, dull, and cliche--It hurts to watch this flick
","I didn't finish watching this film, but I bet I could tell you how it ends. It's filled with the kind of childish predictability for the less-than-average-intelligence audience.  After the first hour, I found myself becoming more intrigued by the lint between my toes.  The cliches keep piling on top of each other until you just wait in anticipation for the whole thing to come crashing down.  The little kid plays a role that's seemingly to important and waaaaaay overdramatic; you would never see such a thing happen in real life.  Also, there's something incredibly unrealistic about the way the words of a 30-year-old screenwriter come out of an 8-year-old's mouth.  This movie is the farthest thing from real life there is.Matt Damon.  Disgusting.Will Smith.  Boring.And Charlize.  The south will never claim her.I hate the game of golf, and this movie made me hate it even more.  Don't waste your money or time, people.",Null,3,6,27 November 2002
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Kind of pointless...
","I heard my friends rave about this movie before I saw it.  I heard them rave about it AFTER I saw it.  But as for me, I did no raving--no, this movie is not worth a second thought.The dialogue is rather ridiculous and the fighting scenes were made to entertain an audience with the mind of a child.  Warriors flitting from tree to tree, soaring across the tops of buildings...  This was not my type of action at all.The romance was blah.  I mean, it was well-acted or whatever, but there was nothing special about it.  A typical love story set in an atypical, unbelievable context.Basically, what we have with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a big budget, a good choreographer, and a few good actors.  I'm sorry, however, that this does not constitute all the right ingredients for a good movie.  Make it have a point.",Null,0,1,3 January 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," An excellent film; not to be degraded by the naysaying Tolkienites
","Tolkien wrote a wonderful story; full of magic and wonder and valor and all those little elements that make an adventure book wonderful.Now, Jackson has made a brilliant adaptation of the book into a motion picture, full of magic and wonder and valor and all the elements that make an adventure movie wonderful.All the naysaying Tolkienites who criticize the movie need to get over themselves.  I'd like to see them do better.  True, the movie strayed from certain major details in the book, but what movie adapted from a book hasn't?  Plus, all of the changes are not profane at all to the ends or themes of the books.  If Jackson had spent as much time as most die-hard Ring fans would have him, the movie would be 9 hours long and would appeal only to those die-hard fans.  I actually reviewed the chapters of the books, and he never strayed from the central, critical idea at all.  I see a great culmination in 'The Return of the King' coming together quite nicely.Additionally, The CGI is unreal.  The Ents and Gollum are especially wonderful, and the battle scenes--although sometimes hard to follow--are especially elegant and crafty.  Jackson in no way sacrificed character depth for graphics and imagery in the character of Gollum.  In fact, Gollum's character deserves a nomination for best supporting actor.Jackson knows what he is doing here.  He's cunning and brilliant, and to the distraught Tokienites who would have him beheaded, I say TTT is worthy of the 'Best Picture' Oscar.",10,0,0,25 December 2002
Mulholland Drive," Completely devoid of sense or reason
","This movie is meaningless.  Full of a bunch of random scenes put together out of sequence, with bad acting, this film is a sham by David Lynch and the public is the hoaxed.Anyone who says they can get any meaning out of this movie is either short of brain cells or really, really high.The way to market a movie like this:  get two pretty actresses and make them have lesbian sex scenes.What a joke and waste of film.  Don't even bother renting unless you like soft-core porn with no plot.  But even if you like that, just get a porn anyway; it has more action and rationality.",Null,0,1,30 December 2002
